Descriptions of habitat temperatures and predicted changes in climate usually consider mean monthly, seasonal or annual conditions. Ectotherms, however, do not simply experience mean conditions, but are exposed to daily fluctuations in habitat temperatures. Here, we highlight how temperature fluctuation can generate realized' thermal reaction (fitness) norms that differ from the fundamental' norms derived under standard constant temperatures. Using a mosquito as a model organism, we find that temperature fluctuation reduces rate processes such as development under warm conditions, increases processes under cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and the critical maximum temperature. Generalizing these effects for a range of terrestrial insects reveals that prevailing daily fluctuations in temperature should alter the sensitivity of species to climate warming by reducing thermal safety margins'. Such effects of daily temperature dynamics have generally been ignored in the climate change literature.","[Paaijmans, Krijn P.; Heinig, Rebecca L.; Seliga, Rebecca A.; Blanford, Simon; Murdock, Courtney C.; Thomas, Matthew B.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Paaijmans, Krijn P.; Heinig, Rebecca L.; Seliga, Rebecca A.; Blanford, Simon; Murdock, Courtney C.; Thomas, Matthew B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Paaijmans, Krijn P.] Hosp Clin Univ Barcelona, Barcelona Ctr Int Hlth Res CRESIB, E-08036 Barcelona, Spain; [Blanford, Justine I.] Penn State Univ, GeoVISTA Ctr, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Blanford, Simon] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; ISGlobal; CRESIB; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Paaijmans, KP (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","krijn@paaijmans.nl","Paaijmans, Krijn/ABC-9928-2020","Blanford, Justine/0000-0003-0844-9390; Bova, Rebecca/0000-0002-7334-7211","NSF-EID program [EF-0914384]; Pennsylvania Department of Health","NSF-EID program(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Pennsylvania Department of Health","We thank Silvie Huijben for her help with R-coding, and Janet Teeple and Katey Glunt for assistance in the laboratory.

Here we develop a theoretical framework for elucidating temperature effects on competition that integrates mechanistic descriptions of life-history trait responses to temperature with population models that realistically capture the variable developmental delays that characterize ectotherm life cycles. This framework yields testable comparative predictions about how intraspecific competition affects reproduction, development, and mortality under alternative hypotheses about the temperature dependence of competition. The key finding is that ectotherm population regulation in seasonal environments depends crucially on the mechanisms by which temperature affects competition. When competition is strongest at temperatures optimal for reproduction, effects of temperature and competition act antagonistically, leading to more complex dynamics than when competition is temperature independent. When the strength of competition increases with temperature past the optimal temperature for reproduction, effects of temperature and competition act synergistically, leading to dynamics qualitatively similar to those when competition is temperature independent. Paradoxically, antagonistic effects yield a higher population floor despite greater fluctuations. These findings have important implications for predicting effects of climate warming on population regulation. Synergistic effects of temperature and competition can predispose populations to stochastic extinction by lowering minimum population sizes, while antagonistic effects can increase the potential for population outbreaks through greater fluctuations in abundance.","[Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Coutinho, Renato M.] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Fis Teor, BR-01405 Sao Paulo, Brazil","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Universidade Estadual Paulista","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","amarasek@ucla.edu","Coutinho, Renato M/H-9133-2017","Coutinho, Renato M/0000-0002-2828-8558","James S.

Yet, while both mean temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs) are expected to increase under global warming, latitudinal differences in the effects of DTFs have not been documented. We tested whether low-latitude populations of an ectotherm deal better with greater DTF than high-latitude populations, especially at a high mean temperature close to the optimal temperature for growth where DTF causes exposure to extreme high temperatures. We evaluated the impact of DTFs when assessing the effect of gradual thermal evolution at the high latitude with a space-for-time substitution. We compared effects of both mean temperatures (20 and 24 degrees C) and DTFs (constant=0 degrees C, low=5 degrees C and high=10 degrees C) on growth rates between low-latitude and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans in a common-garden experiment. DTFs, if anything, reduced growth and were generally stressful as indicated by reductions in body condition, antioxidant defence and metabolic rate, and increases in oxidative damage. Most negative effects of DTFs were only present at a mean of 24 degrees C when too high temperatures were reached during a daily cycle. Notably, while 4 degrees C warming was beneficial in terms of growth rate at both latitudes at a constant temperature regime, this changed in a negative effect at high DTF. Moreover, this modulating effect of the mean temperature by DTF differed between latitudes indicating local thermal adaptation. While 4 degrees C warming at low DTF still caused faster growth in low-latitude larvae, it already slowed growth in high-latitude larvae. This supports the emerging insight that warming would increase growth in high-latitude larvae in the absence of DTF, yet would decrease growth in the more realistic scenarios with DTF. In contrast, a space-for-time substitution approach suggested that under gradual thermal evolution, the evolved high-latitude larvae would no longer suffer a growth reduction in the presence of DTF. Our study provided important proof-of-principle that jointly integrating gradual thermal evolution and the expected increase in DTF generates opposing predictions of effects of global warming on this ectotherm.","[Verheyen, Julie; Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium","KU Leuven","Verheyen, J (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium.","julie.verheyen@kuleuven.be","Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020","Verheyen, Julie/0000-0001-7496-5137; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459","FWO [G.0524.17]; KU Leuven grant [C16/17/002]","FWO(FWO); KU Leuven grant","We thank Philippe Lambret, Dinh Van Khuong, Kent Olsen and Ulf Norling for collecting the damselfly eggs, Ria Van Houdt for the physiological analyses and assistance during the experiment, Geert Neyens and Rony Van Aerschot for technical support and Vienna Delnat for assistance during the experiment.

Because thermal performance curves are non-linear, mean performance can differ in fluctuating and constant thermal environments. However, time-dependent effects - effects of the order and duration of exposure to temperature - can also influence mean performance. We quantified the non-linear and time-dependent effects of diurnally fluctuating temperatures for larval growth rates in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta L., with four main results. First, the shape of the thermal performance curve for growth rate depended on the duration of exposure: for example, optimal temperature and thermal breadth were greater for growth rates measured over short (24 h during the last instar) compared with long (the entire period of larval growth) time periods. Second, larvae reared in diurnally fluctuating temperatures had significantly higher optimal temperatures and maximal growth rates than larvae reared in constant temperatures. Third, for larvae maintained at three mean temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three diurnal temperature ranges (+/- 0, +/- 5 and +/- 10 degrees C), diurnal fluctuations had opposite effects on mean growth rates at low versus high mean temperature. Fourth, both short-and long-term thermal performance curves yielded poor predictions of the non-linear effects of fluctuating temperature on mean growth rates (compared with our experimental results) at higher mean temperatures. Our results suggest caution in using constant temperature studies to model the consequences of variable thermal environments.","[Kingsolver, Joel G.; Higgins, Jessica K.; Augustine, Kate E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Kingsolver, JG (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.","jgking@bio.unc.edu","","","US National Science Foundation [IOS-1120500]","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation [IOS-1120500 to J.G.K.].",NA,"52","103","105","1","62","COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

We combine modelling and experiments to test how temperature and food availability variance jointly affect life-history traits of ectotherms. The model predicts that as mean temperatures move away from the ectotherm's thermal optimum, the effect size of joint thermal and food variance should become increasingly sensitive to their covariance. Below the thermal optimum, performance should be positively correlated with food-temperature covariance and the opposite is predicted above it. At lower temperatures, covariance should determine whether food and temperature variance increases or decreases performance compared to constant conditions. Somewhat stronger than predicted, the covariance effect below the thermal optimum was confirmed experimentally on an aquatic ectotherm (Daphnia magna) exposed to diurnal food and temperature variance with different amounts of covariance.

Such models ignore the effects of time dependence-the temporal pattern and duration of temperature exposure-on performance. We developed and solved a simple mathematical model for growth rate of ectotherms, combining thermal performance curves for ingestion rate with the temporal dynamics of gene expression and protein production in response to high temperatures to predict temporal patterns of growth rate in constant and diurnally fluctuating temperatures. We used the model to explore the effects of heat shock proteins on larval growth rates of Manduca sexta. The model correctly captures two empirical patterns for larval growth rate: first, maximal growth rate and optimal temperature decline with increasing duration of temperature exposure; second, mean growth rates decline with time in diurnally fluctuating temperatures at higher mean temperatures. These qualitative results apply broadly to cases where proteins or other molecules produced in response to high temperatures reduce growth rates. We discuss some of the critical assumptions and predictions of the model and suggest potential extensions and alternatives. Incorporating time-dependent effects will be essential for making more realistic predictions about the physiological and ecological consequences of temperature fluctuations and climate change.","[Kingsolver, Joel G.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Woods, H.

Although recent work suggests that changes in temperature variation will have disproportionately greater effects on species than changes to the mean, much of climate change research in ecology has focused on the impacts of mean temperature change. Here, we couple fine-grained climate projections (2050-2059) to thermal performance data from 38 ectothermic invertebrate species and contrast projections with those of a simple model. We show that projections based on mean temperature change alone differ substantially from those incorporating changes to the variation, and to the mean and variation in concert. Although most species show increases in performance at greater mean temperatures, the effect of mean and variance change together yields a range of responses, with temperate species at greatest risk of performance declines. Our work highlights the importance of using fine-grained temporal data to incorporate the full extent of temperature variation when assessing and projecting performance.","[Vasseur, David A.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [DeLong, John P.] Univ Nebraska, Sch Biol Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Gilbert, Benjamin] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3G5, Canada; [Greig, Hamish S.] Univ Canterbury, Sch Biol Sci, Christchurch 1, New Zealand; [Greig, Hamish S.] Univ Maine, Sch Biol & Ecol, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Harley, Christopher D.

Metabolic sensitivity to environmental temperature change increases in positive exponential relation with initial acclimated rates of energy expenditure, and is influenced by the relative rate with which intracellular amino acids are being mobilised by protein turnover. 2. Greater metabolic sensitivity results in greater physiological variability with fluctuating temperatures, higher energy costs incurred during the response to temperature change, and reduced viability upon exposure to extreme high temperatures. 3. These interrelations help explain the faster production and greater viability of multi-locus heterozygotes experimentally exposed to increased temperature and other stressors, as well as ecogeographical associations indicating the superiority of multi-locus heterozygotes in heterogeneous environments. 4.

Diffusion is less affected than the diverse enzymatic reactions that have distinct individual temperature profiles. Hence thermal fluctuations pose a formidable challenge to ectothermic organisms in which body temperature is largely dictated by the ambient temperature. How cells in ectotherms cope with the myriad disruptive effects of temperature variation is poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we show that nucleocytoplasmic posttranslational modification of proteins with O-linked GlcNAc (O-GlcNAc) is closely correlated with ambient temperature during development of distantly related ectotherms ranging from the insect Drosophila melanogaster to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to the fish Danio rerio. Regulation seems to occur at the level of activity of the only two enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase and O-GlcNAcase, that add and remove, respectively, this posttranslational modification in nucleus and cytoplasm. With genetic approaches in D. melanogaster and C. elegans, we demonstrate the importance of high levels of this posttranslational modification for successful development at elevated temperatures. Because many cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in diverse pathways are O-GlcNAc targets, temperature-dependent regulation of this modification might contribute to an efficient coordinate adjustment of cellular processes in response to thermal change.","[Radermacher, Pablo T.; Myachina, Faina; Bosshardt, Fritz; Lehner, Christian F.] Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Life Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pandey, Rahul] Univ Bayreuth, Inst Genet, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany; [Mariappa, Daniel; Mueller, H-Arno J.] Univ Dundee, Coll Life Sci, Dundee DD1 5EH, Scotland","University of Zurich; University of Bayreuth; University of Dundee","Lehner, CF (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Mol Life Sci, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.","christian.lehner@imls.uzh.ch","Müller, Hans-Arno/G-5753-2012; Mariappa, Daniel/AAQ-7135-2020; Muller, Hans-Arno/Q-2864-2019","Müller, Hans-Arno/0000-0002-7525-6874; Muller, Hans-Arno/0000-0002-7525-6874; Mariyappa, Daniel/0000-0003-4775-1656","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Le987/4-1]; Medical Research Council [G0501679]; MRC [G0501679, G0901020] Funding Source: UKRI; STFC [ST/K001051/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G0901020] Funding Source: researchfish","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); STFC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)European Commission)","We thank Stefan Luschnig, Alex Hajnal, Juan Miguel Escobar, Urs Greber, Christian Mosimann, and Stephan Neuhauss for advice and support provided during experimental work with D. melanogaster, HeLa cells, C. elegans, and D. rerio; Barry Honda and Hugo Stocker for providing fly strains; Jongkyeong Chung and Matthias Peter for antibodies; Andre Koch and Stefano Leo for contributing some initial analyses; and Bruce Edgar for comments on the manuscript.

Studies using variable thermal environments can improve ecological relevance of data because organisms naturally face day-to-day stochastic temperature fluctuations as well as seasonal changes in the amplitude of such daily fluctuations. The objective of this study was to investigate if, and to what extent, the use of constant temperatures is justified in studies of the model species, yellow dung fly, Scatophaga stercoraria (L.). We examined the effect of temperature fluctuation on the expression of several life history traits and the effect on subsequent adult longevity. We used two fluctuating temperature treatments with the same mean but different amplitudes (15/21 degrees C, 12/24 degrees C; 12/12 h), and three constant temperature treatments spanning the wide temperature range faced in the wild (12, 18, and 24 degrees C). Large temperature fluctuation was mostly detrimental (lower juvenile survival, slower growth, smaller body size, and longer development), whereas moderate temperature fluctuation usually gave responses similar to the constant regime. Whendeveloping in fluctuating temperatures, adult longevity (no effect), body size (lower), and wing shape (narrower wings) deviated from the expectations based on the constant temperature reaction norms, presumably because of acclimation responses. Contrary to some studies no obvious beneficial effects of moderate temperature fluctuation were observed. Instead, yellow dung flies seem to canalize development in the face of temperature fluctuation up to a point when detrimental effects become unavoidable. The relatively greater effects of extreme constant developmental temperatures question their biological relevance in experiments.","[Kjaersgaard, Anders; Loeschcke, Volker] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci Integrat Ecol & Evolut, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Kjaersgaard, Anders; Blanckenhorn, Wolf U.] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Pertoldi, Cino] Aalborg Univ, Dept Sect Environm Engn 18, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark; [Pertoldi, Cino] Aalborg Zoo, DK-9000 Aalborg, Denmark","Aarhus University; University of Zurich; Aalborg University","Kjaersgaard, A (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci Integrat Ecol & Evolut, Ny Munkegade 114-116, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.","anders.kjaersgaard@biology.au.dk","Dietz, Rune/F-9154-2015; Pertoldi, Cino/I-1746-2012; Loeschcke, Volker/J-2527-2013","Dietz, Rune/0000-0001-9652-317X; Pertoldi, Cino/0000-0002-4644-8981; Loeschcke, Volker/0000-0003-1450-0754","European Science Foundation; Danish Council for Independent Research-Natural Sciences [11-107166, 11-103926, 09-065999, 95095995]","European Science Foundation(European Science Foundation (ESF)European Commission); Danish Council for Independent Research-Natural Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","We thank the European Science Foundation for financial support from the ThermAdapt program: 'Thermal Adaptation in ectotherms: linking life history, physiology, behavior and genetics.

Jensen???s inequality predicts that the performance of an organism under fluctuating temperature conditions is inferior to that under the equivalent constant temperature condition when the mean temperature approaches or exceeds the thermal optimum. However, we found this prediction is not always valid by checking the independent data from different species. By simulating the present and future thermal scenarios, we studied the fitness-related responses of a global pest, the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae, under different constant and equivalent fluctuating temperatures with different variances and made predictions based on Jensen???s inequality. We found that the effects of temperature variation are dependent on the temperature fluctuation range when the mean temperature approached or exceeded the thermal optimum; moderate fluctuations (vs. constant temperature) had positive or no effects on the developmental rate, fecundity, intrinsic rate of increase, and net reproductive rate, whereas large fluctuations considerably reduced these fitness-related responses. Our findings suggested that Jensen???s inequality is not always powerful in thermal biology, especially when the natural temperatures are high. Jensen???s inequality could not predict the performance improvements at moderate fluctuations and the large reductions in performance at large fluctuations. Therefore, more attention is needed in the directional deviations at a high mean with small-to-moderate fluctuations and the quantitative deviation at a high mean with large fluctuations, while using Jensen???s inequality to predict the responses to climate warming.","[Wang, Xue-Jing; Ma, Chun-Sen] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Climate Change Biol Res Grp, 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Plant Protection, CAAS","Ma, CS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Climate Change Biol Res Grp, 2 Yuanmingyuan West Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.","machunsen@caas.cn","Ma, Chun-Sen/K-5414-2019","Ma, Chun-Sen/0000-0002-3253-6921","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31620103914]; Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of CAAS [ZDRW202108, ZDRW202012]; Fundamental Research Funds of CAAS [Y2017LM10]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of CAAS; Fundamental Research Funds of CAAS","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31620103914) , Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program of CAAS (ZDRW202108, ZDRW202012) , the Fundamental Research Funds of CAAS (Y2017LM10) .",NA,"35","0","0","4","4","E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG","STUTTGART","NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY","0171-8177","2363-7102","","ENTOMOL GEN","Entomol.

Woodlice (the terrestrial isopod Porcellio laevis) exhibit a readily observed behaviour that may reflect their acclimation capacities. When they find themselves on their back, they sometimes roll over (i.e. right themselves). Whether they do, and how fast they do it, are measures of their behaviour and performance that vary with ambient temperature. Goal: Measure experimentally the effect of acclimation to environmental thermal variability on the rollover behaviour of Porcellio laevis. Methods: Maintain woodlice in 24 degrees C laboratory environments. Each individual lived in one of three thermal treatments: constant temperature regime (delta = 0); a regime with alternating temperatures of 27 degrees C during daytime and 21 degrees C at night (delta = 3); and a regime with alternating temperatures of 32 degrees C during daytime and 16 degrees C at night (delta = 8). After 3 months, measure the rollover behaviour (percentage that rolled over) and rollover speed of the woodlice at 5, 15, 25, 32, and 38 degrees C. Rollover speed is the inverse of the time it took an individual to right itself. Results: At 5 and 38 degrees C, most woodlice seemed to be in thermal coma and had very slow rollover speed. At 15, 25, and 32 degrees C, rollover speed was in the range 0.12-0.18 rollovers per second. At 15, 25, and 32 degrees C, 52% of individuals righted themselves in similar to 4 s. At these temperatures, most individuals either rolled quickly or remained inactive for the entire 10-min test period. When we examined rollover speed in the cooler (night) and warmer (daytime) periods, individuals subjected to the three regimes of temperature variation differed: woodlice acclimated to delta = 8 roll over very fast when temperature (T) is low and very slowly when T is high; woodlice acclimated to delta = 3 roll over fairly fast when T is low and somewhat slowly when T is high; and woodlice acclimated to delta = 0 roll over quite quickly when T is low and quite slowly when T is high. However, the higher and lower speeds at different regimes neutralized each other so that average rollover speed over the course of a whole day did not depend on the size of the daily fluctuation. Conclusions: The impact of temperature variability must be taken into consideration. Behavioural responses that are seemingly costly in the very short term may be beneficial in the longer term.","[Bozinovic, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Bozinovic, Francisco; Sabat, Pablo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil, Santiago, Chile; [Sabat, Pablo; Canals, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Fac Ciencias, Dept Ciencias Ecol, Santiago, Chile; [Rezende, Enrico L.] Univ Roehampton, Ctr Res Ecol, Dept Life Sci, London, England; [Canals, Mauricio] Univ Chile, Fac Med, Escuela Salud Publ, Programa Salud Ambiental, Santiago, Chile","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad de Chile; Roehampton University; Universidad de Chile","Bozinovic, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile.","fbozinovic@bio.puc.cl","Rezende, Enrico L/B-8029-2012; Rezende, Enrico L./S-3219-2019","Rezende, Enrico L/0000-0002-6245-9605; Rezende, Enrico L./0000-0002-6245-9605","CAPES [FB002];  [FONDECYT-1130015];  [FONDECYT-1120276]","CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); ; ","All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee, Universidad Catolica.

This is puzzling because tropical ectotherms, being thermal specialists, face a harsher abiotic environment and competition from temperate residents that are thermal generalists. We develop a mathematical framework to address this puzzle. We find that (i) tropical ectotherms can invade temperate habitats if they have higher consumption rates and lower mortality during warmer summers, (ii) stronger seasonal fluctuations at higher latitudes create more temporal niches, allowing coexistence of tropical invaders and temperate residents, and (iii) temperate ectotherms' failure to invade tropical habitats is due to greater mortality rather than lower competitive ability. Our framework yields predictions about population-level outcomes of invasion success based solely on species' trait responses to temperature. It provides a potential ecological explanation for why the tropics constitute both a cradle and a museum of biodiversity.","[Amarasekare, Priyanga; Simon, Margaret W.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Simon, Margaret W.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.","amarasek@ucla.edu","","Simon, Margaret/0000-0001-8269-2589","James S.

In terrestrial (or semiterrestrial) ectotherms, thermoregulation and hydroregulation closely interact and combined temperature and water constraints should directly influence individual performances. Although comparative physiologists traditionally investigate jointly water and temperature regulation, the ecological and evolutionary implications of these coupled processes have so far mostly been studied independently. Here, we revisit the concept of thermo-hydroregulation to address the functional integration of body temperature and water balance regulation in terrestrial ectotherms. We demonstrate how thermo-hydroregulation provides a framework to investigate functional adaptations to joint environmental variation in temperature and water availability, and potential physiological and/or behavioral conflicts between thermoregulation and hydroregulation. We extend the classical cost-benefit model of thermoregulation in ectotherms to highlight the adaptive evolution of optimal thermo-hydroregulation strategies. Critical gaps in the parameterization of this conceptual optimality model and guidelines for future empirical research are discussed.

While estimating the temperature dependence of performance traits such as growth and development rate is feasible under controlled laboratory settings, predictions in nature are difficult. One major challenge lies in translating performance under constant conditions to fluctuating environments. Using the butterfly Pieris napi as model system, we show that development rate, an important fitness trait, can be accurately predicted in the field using models parameterized under constant laboratory temperatures. Additionally, using a factorial design, we show that accurate predictions can be made across microhabitats but critically hinge on adequate consideration of non-linearity in reaction norms, spatial heterogeneity in microclimate and temporal variation in temperature. Our empirical results are also supported by a comparison of published and simulated data. Conclusively, our combined results suggest that, discounting direct effects of temperature, insect development rates are generally unaffected by thermal fluctuations.","[von Schmalensee, Loke; Hulda Gunnarsdottir, Katrin; Gotthard, Karl; Lehmann, Philipp] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, Stockholm, Sweden; [Naslund, Joacim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources, Uppsala, Sweden","Stockholm University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","von Schmalensee, L (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, Stockholm, Sweden.","loke.von.schmalensee@zoologi.su.se","von Schmalensee, Loke/AAD-7360-2022; Lehmann, Philipp/AEO-0158-2022","von Schmalensee, Loke/0000-0003-3233-4905","Vetenskapsradet [2017-04159]; Svenska Forskningsradet Formas [2017-00965]","Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council); Svenska Forskningsradet Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas)","Vetenskapsradet, Grant/Award Number: 2017-04159; Svenska Forskningsradet Formas, Grant/Award Number: 2017-00965",NA,"79","12","12","4","17","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1461-023X","1461-0248","","ECOL LETT","Ecol.

However, another but poorly studied main characteristic of global change appears to be an increase in temperature variability. Most of the current analyses of global change have focused on mean values, paying less attention to the role of the fluctuations of environmental variables. We experimentally tested the effects of environmental temperature variability on characteristics associated to the fitness (body mass balance, growth rate, and survival), metabolic rate (VCO2) and molecular traits (heat shock protein expression, Hsp70), in an ectotherm, the terrestrial woodlouse Porcellio laevis. Our general hypotheses are that higher values of thermal amplitude may directly affect life-history traits, increasing metabolic cost and stress responses. At first, results supported our hypotheses showing a diversity of responses among characters to the experimental thermal treatments. We emphasize that knowledge about the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which animals cope with environmental changes is essential to understand the impact of mean climatic change and variability. Also, we consider that the studies that only incorporate only mean temperatures to predict the life-history, ecological and evolutionary impact of global temperature changes present important problems to predict the diversity of responses of the organism. This is because the analysis ignores the complexity and details of the molecular and physiological processes by which animals cope with environmental variability, as well as the life-history and demographic consequences of such variability.

Theory suggests that effects should vary with temperature, being especially pronounced at more extreme low (because of thermal respite) and high (because of Jensen's inequality) temperatures. Here we tested this idea by examining the effects of constant temperatures (10 to 30 degrees C in 5 degrees C increments) and fluctuating temperatures (means equal to the constant temperatures, but with fluctuations of +/- 5 degrees C) temperatures on the adult (F2) phenotypic plasticity of three thermal performance traits - critical thermal minimum (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and upper lethal temperature (ULT50) in ten species of springtails (Collembola) from three families (Isotomidae 7 spp.; Entomobryidae 2 spp.; Onychiuridae 1 sp.). The lowest mean CTmin value recorded here was -3.56 +/- 1.0 degrees C for Paristoma notabilis and the highest mean CTmax was 43.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C for Hemisotoma thermophila. The Acclimation Response Ratio for CTmin was on average 0.12 degrees C/degrees C (range: 0.04 to 0.21 degrees C/degrees C), but was much lower for CTmax (mean: 0.017 degrees C/degrees C, range: -0.015 to 0.047 degrees C/degrees C) and lower also for ULT50 (mean: 0.05 degrees C/degrees C, range: -0.007 to 0.14 degrees C/degrees C). Fluctuating versus constant temperatures typically had little effect on adult phenotypic plasticity, with effect sizes either no different from zero, or inconsistent in the direction of difference. Previous work assessing adult phenotypic plasticity of these thermal performance traits across a range of constant temperatures can thus be applied to a broader range of circumstances in springtails.","[Hoskins, Jessica L.; Ireland, Elise; Monro, Keyne; Chown, Steven L.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton Campus,Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Janion-Scheepers, Charlene] Iziko Museums South Africa, ZA-8001 Cape Town, South Africa; [Janion-Scheepers, Charlene] Univ Cape Town, Dept Biol Sci, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa","Monash University; University of Cape Town","Hoskins, JL (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton Campus,Wellington Rd, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.","jess.hoskins@monash.edu; Charlene.janion-scheepers@uct.ac.za; elise.c.ireland@gmail.com; keyne.monro@monash.edu; steven.chown@monash.edu","Chown, Steven/ABD-7646-2021","Janion-Scheepers, Charlene/0000-0001-5942-7912","Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship; Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment - Equity Trustees Charitable Foundation; Ecological Society of Australia; Australian Research Council [DP170101046]","Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment - Equity Trustees Charitable Foundation; Ecological Society of Australia; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This work was funded by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship and by the Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment - Equity Trustees Charitable Foundation & the Ecological Society of Australia, awarded to JLH, and by Australian Research Council Discovery Project DP170101046.",NA,"100","2","2","2","17","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0306-4565","","","J THERM BIOL","J.

In contrast, for reptiles, comparatively less is known on the potential effects of water balance on physiology, ecology and behaviour. In recent years, several recent studies are pointing out the importance of studying thermoregulation and water balance within the same framework. Here, we used a Mediterranean lizard, Psammodromus algirus, to investigate how field body temperature and water loss rates may vary among populations, between sexes and along an altitudinal gradient. We found little variation in field body temperatures among populations, while within each population, field body temperature may change daily, seasonally and differ between sexes. On the contrary, water loss rates decreased with elevation and showed no seasonal trend or difference between sexes. Microclimatic data indicated that highland lizards experienced more fluctuating conditions, a factor that may explain their lower water loss rates. Other factors, like inter-population differences in ectoparasite intensity, might also contribute in explaining the observed patterns. We present here the first data for a lacertid lizard on the inter-population variability and sexual difference in water loss rates and point out that water balance may play a fundamental role in regulating lizard activity during the hottest and driest period of the year.","Univ Porto, InBIO, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, CIBIO, Vila Do Conde, Portugal; Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Porto, Portugal; Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Madrid, Spain","Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (MNCN)","Sannolo, M (corresponding author), Univ Porto, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, InBIO, Rua Padre Armando Quintas, P-4485661 Vila Do Conde, Portugal.","marco.sannolo@gmail.com","Sannolo, Marco/AAA-7909-2020; Martin, Jose/B-1073-2014; Carretero, Miguel A/A-1472-2013; Civantos, Emilio/C-6280-2012","Sannolo, Marco/0000-0001-6760-1159; Martin, Jose/0000-0001-6648-3998; Carretero, Miguel A/0000-0002-2335-7198; Civantos, Emilio/0000-0003-1251-4677","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal) [SFRH/BD/103549/2014]; FCT [SFRH/BPD/109182/2015, PTDC/BIA-CBI/28014/2017]; MINECO [CGL2014-53523-P]","Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); FCT(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission); MINECO(Spanish Government)","Permits to capture and handle lizards were granted by the government of Madrid region (permit number: 10/165952.9/18).

Using a globally important model species, the blue mussel Mytilus, in a 5-week-long experiment, we (a) assessed growth performance traits under 12 scenarios, consisting of four thermal averages (18.5, 21, 23.5 and 26celcius) imposed as constant or daily fluctuating regimes with amplitudes of 2 or 4celcius. Additionally, we conducted a short-term assay using different mussel individuals to (b) test for the species capacity for suppression and recovery of metabolic performance traits (feeding and aerobic respiration) when exposed to a 1-day thermal fluctuation regime (16.8-30.5celcius). Using this high-resolution data, we (c) generated short-term thermal metabolic performance curves to predict and explain growth responses observed in the long-term experiment. We found that daily high-amplitude thermal cycles (4celcius) improved mussel growth when fluctuations were imposed around an extreme average temperature of 26celcius, representing end-of-century heatwaves. In contrast, thermal cycles negatively affected mussel growth at a less extreme average temperature of 23.5celcius, resembling current peak summer temperature scenarios. These results suggest that fluctuations ameliorate heat stress impacts only at critically high average temperatures. The short-term assay demonstrated that during the warming phase, animals stopped feeding between 24 and 30celcius while gradually suppressing respiration. In the subsequent cooling phase, feeding and respiration partially and fully recovered to pre-heating rates respectively. Furthermore, nonlinear averaging of short-term feeding responses (upscaling) well-predicted longer term growth responses to fluctuations. Our findings suggest that fluctuations can be beneficial to or detrimental for the long-term performance of ectothermic animals, depending on the fluctuations' average and amplitude. Furthermore, the observed effects can be linked to fluctuation-mediated metabolic suppression and recovery. In a general framework, we propose various hypothetical scenarios of fluctuation impacts on ectotherm performance considering inter- or intra-species variability in heat sensitivity. Our research highlights the need for studying metabolic performance in relation to cyclic abiotic fluctuations to advance the understanding of climate change impacts on aquatic systems.

Mechanisms that reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of DTFs. Species that experience varying degrees of DTFs in their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to DTFs, tadpoles from habitats characterised by small DTFs would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large DTFs. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24 degrees C) and DTF treatments (20-30 degrees C and 18-38 degrees C). DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats (similar to 15%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats (similar to 30%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although DTFs induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6 degrees C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal variability may favour some species while others are negatively impacted.

Here, we tested this prediction in a neotropical pseudoscorpion. Nymphs were reared in control and high-temperature treatments under a constant daily temperature regime, and results compared to a companion fluctuating-temperature study. At constant temperature, pseudoscorpions outperformed their fluctuating-temperature counterparts. Individuals were larger, developed faster, and males produced more sperm, and females more embryos. The greatest impact of temperature regime involved short-term, adult exposure, with constant temperature mitigating high-temperature effects on reproductive traits.

The analysis provides a mechanistic explanation for the decreased amplitude of daily cycles in T-b and the increase in 'average' T-b with increasing mass. Assessments of 'average' daily T-b were made by dividing the integral of the difference between measured values of T-b and minimum operative temperature by the period of integration, to yield a thermal index expressing relative 'warmth' of crocodiles. The average daily T-b of a 1010 kg crocodile was 3.7 degrees C warmer than that of a 42 kg individual in summer and 1.9 degrees C warmer than that of a 32 kg individual in winter. The success of this mathematical approach confirms that crocodiles are simple ectotherms and that there is unlikely to be a significant contribution to their thermal biology from physiological mechanisms. Behaviour, however, is very important even in large individuals. Crocodiles in the field typically move daily between land and water in cycles that vary seasonally. We predicted T-b for the reverse of these behavioural cycles, which more than doubled seasonal fluctuations in T-b compared with the observed fluctuations. We were also able to predict the T-b of very large, dinosaur-sized crocodiles in a similar climate to that at our study site. A 10000 kg 'crocodile', for example, would be expected to have a T-b of 31 degrees C in winter, varying by less than 0.1 degrees C during a day when operative temperatures varied by nearly 20 degrees C, from 20 to 38 degrees C. The study confirms that, in low latitudes at least, large dinosaurs must have had an essentially high and stable value of T-b, without any need for endothermy. Also, access to shade or water must have been crucial for the survival of large dinosaurs at low latitudes. Furthermore, the finding of increasing 'average' T-b as ectotherms grow larger may have implications for the metabolic rates of very large reptiles, because the Q(10) effect could counteract the downscaling of metabolic rate with mass, an effect that seems not to have been recognised previously.","Univ Queensland, Dept Zool, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","University of Queensland","Seebacher, F (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Dept Zool, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.","","","Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311","","","",NA,"28","122","123","2","77","COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE, CAMBS, ENGLAND CB4 4DL","0022-0949","","","J EXP BIOL","J.

We hypothesize, on the basis of Jensen's inequality, that this pattern is driven by latitudinal variation in seasonal temperature fluctuations. We test this hypothesis with an eco-evolutionary model that integrates the quantitative genetics of reaction norm evolution with stage-structured population dynamics, which we parameterize with data from insects. We find that thermal optima of temperate and Mediterranean species evolve to exceed the mean habitat temperature if seasonal fluctuations are strong, while the thermal optimum of tropical species evolves to coincide with the mean habitat temperature if fluctuations are weak. Importantly, ecological dynamics can impose a constraint on reaction norm evolution. Tropical species cannot tolerate an increase in seasonal fluctuations at the high mean habitat temperature it experiences, while the temperate species cannot tolerate a reduction in seasonal fluctuations if the mean temperature is higher. In both cases, stochastic extinction during periods of low abundances precludes adaptation to a novel thermal environment. Our findings suggest a potential directionality in colonization success. Tropical ectotherms, because of their high thermal optima, can successfully colonize temperate habitats, while temperate ectotherms, because of their low optima, are less successful in colonizing tropical habitats.","[Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Johnson, Christopher] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Ctr Adaptat Changing Environm ACE, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","amarasek@ucla.edu","","Johnson, Christopher/0000-0001-6388-8770","Complex Systems Scholar grant from the James S.

It was hypothesized that the development rate lines of ectotherms within a taxon such as a family would have a common intersection. Thus for a given temperature, the development time should be the same for all the species within any specified taxon. In the current study, the data on temperature-dependent development rates of species of the Aphididae and Tetranychidae families were used to test the validity of the common-intersection hypothesis. The hypothesis was supported with either dataset used. In addition, the current study tested the common-intersection hypothesis through mathematical analysis on the basis of two linear relationships (i.e., the linear relationship between temperature and development rate and that between the lower developmental threshold and the sum of effective temperatures). An attempt was made to combine the rate isomorphy hypothesis that all the lower developmental thresholds of different stages were assumed to be equal for a single species with the common-intersection hypothesis for related species within a taxon and hypothesize that if these two hypotheses hold, then for any developmental stages a common temperature of all stages should exist.

Such functions (e.g., von Bertalanffy's equation, thermal-unit growth coefficient) are currently applied to ectotherms even though they fail to provide analytical expressions that adapt to a wide range of fluctuating temperatures. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the ontogeny of ectotherms exhibiting indeterminate growth have not yet been summarised in terms of a simple but meaningful mathematical equation. Here, a growth function is developed, with parameters having physical or biological interpretation that accommodates indeterminate growth under fluctuating temperatures assuming the latter vary seasonally. The equation is derived as a special case of von Bertalanffy's equation providing realistic growth trajectories throughout the ontogeny of several groups of ectotherms (R-2 > 0.90). The results suggest that the effect of temperature on growth trajectory supersedes that of reproduction in an environment with fluctuating temperature. Furthermore, values of the allometric weight exponent (0 < b < 0.75) indicate that the rules of body surface and body weight do not apply under certain circumstances. Finally, the growth function circumvents problems associated with models based on thermodynamic and chemical kinetic principles (e.g., inability to predict growth of organisms in which ontogeny exceeds 3 months) and on rule of thermal summation (e.g., reliable only in a certain range of temperature). The growth function can handle a wide range of temperature fluctuations, encompass life stages and apply to key organisms in ecology, fisheries and agriculture. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, these rates may be described as a function of light for plants or organic food resources for animals and these could be regulated (or not) by temperature or other conditions. But, what are the consequences for an individual's growth (and also for the population growth) if growth rate variations are themselves dynamic and not steady state? For organisms presenting phases of dormancy or long periods of stress, this is a crucial question. A dynamic perspective for quantifying short-term growth was explored using the daily growth record of the scallop Pecten maximus (L). This species is a good biological model for ectotherm growth because the shell records growth striae daily. Independently, a generic mathematical function representing the dynamics of mean daily growth rate (MDGR) was implemented to simulate a diverse set of growth patterns. Once the function was calibrated with the striae patterns, the growth rate dynamics appeared as a forced damped oscillation during the growth period having a basic periodicity during two transitory phases (mean duration 43 days) and appearing at both growth start and growth end. This phase is most likely due to the internal dynamics of energy transfer within the organism rather than to external forcing factors. After growth restart, the transitory regime represents successive phases of over-growth and regulation. This pattern corresponds to a typical representation of compensatory growth, which from an evolutionary perspective can be interpreted as an adaptive strategy to coping with a fluctuating environment.

Physiologists have historically overcome this hurdle in the laboratory by using 'average' conditions, representative of the natural environment for any given animal. Temperature, in particular, has widespread impact on the physiology of animals, and it is becoming increasingly important to understand these effects as we face future climate challenges. The majority of research to date has focused on the expected global average increase in temperature; however, increases in climate variability are predicted to affect animals as much or more than climate warming. Physiological responses associated with the acclimation to a new stable temperature are distinct from those in thermally variable environments. Our goal is to highlight these physiological differences as they relate to both thermal acclimation and the 'fallacy of the average' or Jensen's inequality using theoretical models and novel empirical data. We encourage the use of more realistic thermal environments in experimental design to advance our understanding of these physiological responses such that we can better predict how aquatic animals will respond to future changes in our climate.","[Morash, Andrea J.; Neufeld, Claire; Currie, Suzanne] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, Canada; [MacCormack, Tyson J.] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Chem & Biochem, Sackville, NB E4L 1G8, Canada; [Currie, Suzanne] Acadia Univ, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada","Mount Allison University; Mount Allison University; Acadia University","Morash, AJ (corresponding author), Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, Canada.","amorash@mta.ca","MacCormack, Tyson/AAJ-8920-2021","MacCormack, Tyson/0000-0002-6080-9413","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [RGPIN-2018-03884, RGPIN-061770]; New Brunswick Innovation Foundation; New Brunswick Environmental Trust Fund [150081]","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); New Brunswick Innovation Foundation; New Brunswick Environmental Trust Fund","This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grants RGPIN-2018-03884 to T.J.M. and RGPIN-061770 to S.C.; a New Brunswick Innovation Foundation grant to S.C. and T.J.M.; and New Brunswick Environmental Trust Fund grant 150081 to S.C. and T.J.M.",NA,"76","51","51","0","22","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

Using a common-garden experimental protocol, we investigated how bidirectional temperature change can affect survival and growth of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and whether the survival and growth responses differ between two populations, using four thermal-variability treatments (mean: 10 degrees C; range: 7-13 degrees C): (i) constancy; (ii) cyclical fluctuations every two days; (iii) low stochasticity (random changes every 2 days); (iv) high stochasticity (random changes daily). Recently hatched individuals were monitored under thermal variability (6 weeks) and a subsequent one-month period of thermal constancy. We found that variability can positively influence survival, relative to thermal constancy, but negatively affect growth. The observations reported here can be interpreted within the context of Jensen's Inequality (performance at average conditions is unequal to average performance across a range of conditions). Projections of future population viability in the context of climate change would be strengthened by increased experimental attention to the fitness consequences of stochastic and non-stochastic thermal variability.","[Pisano, Olivia M.; Hutchings, Jeffrey A.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Kuparinen, Anna] Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 35, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Hutchings, Jeffrey A.] Flodevigen Marine Res Stn, Inst Marine Res, N-4817 His, Norway","Dalhousie University; University of Jyvaskyla; Institute of Marine Research - Norway","Hutchings, JA (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.","oliviapisano@icloud.com; anna.k.kuparinen@jyu.fi; jhutch@dal.ca","Hutchings, Jeffrey/ABA-1098-2020","Kuparinen, Anna/0000-0002-7807-8946; Hutchings, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1572-5429","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [170146-2013]; Academy of Finland; European Research Council [COMPLEX -FISH 400820]","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)European Commission)","We are grateful to Dylan Fraser for securing the eggs for our use, Jim Eddington for fish-husbandry logistics, and Melanie Massey and Bror Jonsson for discussion.

However, TPCs are typically assessed under constant temperature regimes, so their reliability for predicting thermal responses in the wild where temperature fluctuates diurnally and seasonally remains poorly documented. Here, we use distant latitudinal populations of five species of sepsid flies (Diptera: Sepsidae) from the temperate region (Europe, North Africa, North America) to compare estimates derived from constant TPCs with observed development rate under fluctuating temperatures in laboratory and field conditions. TPCs changed across gradients in that flies originating from higher latitudes showed accelerated development at higher temperatures, an adaptive response. TPCs were then used to predict development rates observed under fluctuating temperatures; these predictions were relatively accurate in the laboratory but not the field. Interestingly, the precision of TPC predictions depended not only on the resolution of temperature data, with daily and overall temperature summing performing better than hourly temperature summing, but also on the frequency of temperatures falling below the estimated critical minimum temperature. Hourly temperature resolution most strongly underestimated actual development rates, because flies apparently either did not stop growing when temperatures dropped below this threshold, or they sped up their growth when the temperature rose again, thus most severely reflecting this error. We conclude that when flies do not encounter cold temperatures, TPC predictions based on constant temperatures can accurately reflect performance under fluctuating temperatures if adequately adjusted for nonlinearities, but when encountering cold temperatures, this method is more error-prone. Our study emphasizes the importance of the resolution of temperature data and cold temperatures in shaping thermal reaction norms.","[Khelifa, Rassim; Blanckenhorn, Wolf U.; Roy, Jeannine; Rohner, Patrick T.; Mandjoub, Hayat] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Khelifa, Rassim] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada","University of Zurich; University of British Columbia","Khelifa, R (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.;Khelifa, R (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada.","erassimkhelifa@gmail.com","Rohner, Patrick/P-6250-2019","Rohner, Patrick/0000-0002-9840-1050; Khelifa, Rassim/0000-0001-6632-8787; Blanckenhorn, Wolf/0000-0002-0713-3944; Mahdjoub, Hayat/0000-0002-8972-9628","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [P2ZHP2_ 175028, SNF 31003A-143787]","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF))","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: P2ZHP2_ 175028 and SNF 31003A-143787",NA,"76","13","13","2","27","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-8790","1365-2656","","J ANIM ECOL","J.

The use of different methods complicates comparison between studies and here we present a mathematical model (and R-scripts) to reconcile thermal tolerance measures obtained from static and dynamic assays. Our model uses input data from several static or dynamic experiments and is based on the well-supported assumption that thermal injury accumulation rate increases exponentially with temperature (known as a thermal death time curve). The model also assumes thermal stress at different temperatures to be additive and using experiments with Drosophila melanogaster, we validate these central assumptions by demonstrating that heat injury attained at different heat stress intensities and durations is additive. In a separate experiment we demonstrate that our model can accurately describe injury accumulation during fluctuating temperature stress and further we validate the model by successfully converting literature data of ectotherm heat tolerance (both static and dynamic assays) to a single, comparable metric (the temperature tolerated for 1 h). The model presented here has many promising applications for the analysis of ectotherm thermal tolerance and we also discuss potential pitfalls that should be considered and avoided using this model.","[Jorgensen, Lisa Bjerregaard; Malte, Hans; Orsted, Michael; Klahn, Nikolaj Andreasen; Overgaard, Johannes] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Zoophysiol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Aarhus University","Jorgensen, LB (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Zoophysiol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.","lbj@bio.au.dk","Overgaard, Johannes/AAA-3922-2022; Overgaard, Johannes/I-7493-2013; Jørgensen, Lisa/ABC-2029-2021","Overgaard, Johannes/0000-0002-2851-4551; Jørgensen, Lisa/0000-0002-4438-4558","InEE-CNRS; University of Rennes 1","InEE-CNRS; University of Rennes 1","The authors would like to thank Kirsten Kromand for help with fly maintenance and John S.

Eggs increase in number and decrease in size with increasing (constant) temperature. Day length interacts with temperature: at short day the effect of temperature on size and number fi eggs is weaker than at long day. In diurnally fluctuating temperature regimes, egg size is affected disproportionately by the high temperature period. All treatments, however, are similar in affecting number and size of eggs in an opposite direction. Consequently, egg size is explained to a high degree by egg production rate. The relationship between size and number of eggs among treatments is furthermore characterized by a decrease in egg size with an increase in total egg mass production. Within treatments, rate of egg production and egg size are negatively correlated among females in the low-temperature groups but not in the high-temperature groups; the correlations among females are also characterized by a decrease in egg size, with an increase in total egg mass production. Hence, possible trade-offs between size and number of eggs are masked by phenotypic variation in reproductive effort. The observations enable us to propose a simple conceptual model that explains the within-treatment correlation by the same causal factor as the negative relationship among treatment means.","Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Ecol & Ecotoxicol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","Ernsting, G (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.","ernsting@bio.vu.nl; isaaks@bio.vu.nl","","","","","",NA,"43","61","61","0","33","UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","CHICAGO","1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","0003-0147","1537-5323","","AM NAT","Am.

Organism: Pitcher plant mosquitoes, Wyeomyia smithii. Field sites: We established laboratory colonies from three geographic populations spanning a latitudinal and altitudinal gradient in eastern North America. Sites at lower latitudes or altitudes experience both higher mean temperatures and greater thermal variability during the growing season. Methods: For each of the three sampled populations we analysed the effects of rearing temperature, population, and sex on survival, development time, and mass at pupation for mosquito larvae reared at 16, 20, and 27 degrees C constant temperatures. We also measured the same variables in two fluctuating temperature treatments with means of 20 and 27 degrees C. Using mixed linear models, we tested for the effects of mean temperature, temperature variation, population, and sex including all data except those from 16 degrees C constant. Results: Temperature variation did not have a significant effect on survival to pupation at 20 or 27 degrees C constant. However, low survival at 16 degrees C constant compared with high survival after transient exposure to the same temperature implies that duration of exposure may affect survival to pupation. The effects of temperature variation on both development time and pupal mass depended on mean temperature. Differences between constant and fluctuating temperatures for both these traits were predicted by the non-linear relationship between development rate and temperature (the Kaufmann effect). Moreover, this effect appears to explain geographic variation in the relationship between temperature variation and the measured life-history traits.","[Ragland, Gregory J.; Kingsolver, Joel G.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Ragland, GJ (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.","gragland@ufl.edu","","","","","",NA,"50","85","87","0","43","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD","TUCSON","UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA","1522-0613","1937-3791","","EVOL ECOL RES","Evol.

An iterative estimation method must be used when wind speed varies during the monitoring period. The iterative method is sensitive to measurement error, and so uses a smoothing filter to limit instabilities. The smoothing also limits the short-term fluctuations in the estimated operative temperature.

While an organism's response to high temperature stress clearly depends on current thermal conditions, its response may also be affected by the temporal pattern and duration of past temperature exposures. We used RNA sequencing of Manduca sexta larvae fat body tissue to evaluate how diurnal temperature fluctuations during development affected gene expression both independently and in conjunction with subsequent heat stress. Additionally, we compared gene expression between two M. sexta populations, a lab colony and a genetically related field population that have been separated for >300 generations and differ in their thermal sensitivities. Lab-adapted larvae were predicted to show increased expression responses to both single and repeated thermal stress, whereas recurrent exposure could decrease later stress responses for field individuals. We found large differences in overall gene expression patterns between the two populations across all treatments, as well as population-specific transcriptomic responses to temperature; more differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the field compared with lab larvae. Developmental temperature fluctuations alone had minimal effects on long-term gene expression patterns, with the exception of a somewhat elevated stress response in the lab population. Fluctuating rearing conditions did alter gene expression during exposure to later heat stress, but this effect depended on both the population and the particular temperature conditions. This study contributes to increased knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying physiological responses of organisms to temperature fluctuations, which is needed for the development of more accurate thermal performance models.","[Alston, Meggan A.; Lee, Jeeyun; Moore, M.

We assessed the combined effects of the mean and variance of temperature on thermal tolerances, organismal survival, and population growth in Drosophila melanogaster. Because the performance of ectotherms relates nonlinearly to temperature, we predicted that responses to thermal variation (+/-0 degrees or +/-5 degrees C) would depend on the mean temperature (17 degrees or 24 degrees C). Consistent with our prediction, thermal variation enhanced the rate of population growth (r(max)) at a low mean temperature but depressed this rate at a high mean temperature. The interactive effect on fitness occurred despite the fact that flies improved their heat and cold tolerances through acclimation to thermal conditions. Flies exposed to a high mean and a high variance of temperature recovered from heat coma faster and survived heat exposure better than did flies that developed at other conditions. Relatively high survival following heat exposure was associated with low survival following cold exposure. Recovery from chill coma was affected primarily by the mean temperature; flies acclimated to a low mean temperature recovered much faster than did flies acclimated to a high mean temperature. To develop more realistic predictions about the biological impacts of climate change, one must consider the interactions between the mean environmental temperature and the variance of environmental temperature.","[Bozinovic, Francisco; Bastias, Daniel A.; Boher, Francisca; Clavijo-Baquet, Sabrina; Estay, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile; [Bozinovic, Francisco; Boher, Francisca] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Lab Int Cambio Global, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile; [Estay, Sergio A.] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ecol & Evoluc, Valdivia 6513677, Chile; [Angilletta, Michael J., Jr.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad Austral de Chile; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe","Bozinovic, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile.","fbozinovic@bio.puc.cl","Bastías, Daniel A./GWR-1815-2022; Bastias, Daniel A./AFN-3093-2022","Bastías, Daniel A./0000-0002-0522-5538; Bastias, Daniel A./0000-0002-0522-5538; Estay, Sergio/0000-0002-3797-8964; Clavijo-Baquet, Sabrina/0000-0002-9784-9144","Fondo Nacional de Areas Prioritarias [1501-0001]; Laboratorio Internacional en Cambio Global","Fondo Nacional de Areas Prioritarias; Laboratorio Internacional en Cambio Global","This study was funded by grants from Fondo Nacional de Areas Prioritarias (1501-0001) and Laboratorio Internacional en Cambio Global to F.

The presumed explanation is that high-latitude/altitude organisms have evolved greater acclimation ability because of exposure to greater temperature fluctuations. Using a conceptual model of the thermal environment during the reproductive season, we tested this hypothesis against an alternative that plasticity is greater because of increased exposure to specific temperatures that strongly select for thermal acclimation. We examined geographic variation in floral reflectance/color plasticity among 29 European populations of a widespread perennial herb, Plantago lanceolata. Individuals partially thermoregulate reproduction through temperature-sensitive plasticity in floral reflectance/color. Plasticity was positively correlated with latitude and altitude. Path analyses support the hypothesis that the thermal environment mediates these geographic effects. Plasticity declined as seasonal temperature range increased, and it increased as duration of the growing season shortened and as the proportion of time exposed to temperatures favoring thermoregulation increased. Data provide evidence that floral reflectance/color plasticity is adaptive and that it has evolved in response not to the magnitude of temperature variation during the reproductive season but rather to the relative exposure to low temperatures, which favor thermoregulation.","[Lacey, Elizabeth P.; Lovin, Mary E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA; [Richter, Scott J.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Math & Stat, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA; [Herington, Dean A.] EMC Corp, Durham, NC 27709 USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro","Lacey, EP (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Greensboro, NC 27402 USA.","eplacey@uncg.edu","","","National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB 0236526]; National Evolutionary Synthesis Center [NSF EF-0423641]","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Evolutionary Synthesis Center","We thank G.

This is now even more important because human-induced climate change is predicted to affect both the mean and variability of the thermal environment. Although environmental change occurs ubiquitously, relatively few researchers have studied the effects of fluctuating environments on the performance of developing organisms. Even fewer have tried to validate a framework for predicting performance in fluctuating environments. Here, we determined whether reaction norms based on performance at constant temperatures (18, 22, 26, 30 and 34 degrees C) could be used to predict embryonic and larval performance of anurans at fluctuating temperatures (18-28 degrees C and 18-34C). Based on existing theory, we generated hypotheses about the effects of stress and acclimation on the predictability of performance in variable environments. Our empirical models poorly predicted the performance of striped marsh frogs (Limnodynastes peronii) at fluctuating temperatures, suggesting that extrapolation from studies conducted under artificial thermal conditions would lead to erroneous conclusions. During the majority of ontogenetic stages, growth and development in variable environments proceeded more rapidly than expected, suggesting that acute exposures to extreme temperatures enable greater performance than do chronic exposures. Consistent with theory, we predicted performance more accurately for the less variable thermal environment. Our results underscore the need to measure physiological performance under naturalistic thermal conditions when testing hypotheses about thermal plasticity or when parameterizing models of life-history evolution.","[Niehaus, Amanda C.; Franklin, Craig E.; Wilson, Robbie S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4068, Australia; [Angilletta, Michael J., Jr.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Sears, Michael W.] Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Biol, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA","University of Queensland; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Bryn Mawr College","Wilson, RS (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4068, Australia.","r.wilson@uq.edu.au","Franklin, Craig/G-7343-2012","Franklin, Craig/0000-0003-1315-3797; Wilson, Robbie/0000-0002-0116-5427","Ecological Society of Australia; International Postgraduate Research Scholarship; UQ Graduate School; Australian Research Council (ARC)","Ecological Society of Australia; International Postgraduate Research Scholarship(Australian Government); UQ Graduate School; Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council)","A.C.N. was supported by a student research grant from the Ecological Society of Australia, an International Postgraduate Research Scholarship and a UQ Graduate School Scholarship.

The results supported adaptive responses to face two main constraints limiting the evolution of thermal adaptation. First, we found support for the faster-slower model, indicating an adaptive response to compensate for the thermodynamic constraint of low temperatures in colder environments. Second, we found evidence for the generalist-specialist trade-off with populations from colder and less thermally variable environments exhibiting a specialist phenotype performing at higher rates but over a narrower range of temperatures. By contrast, the local optimal temperature for locomotor performance and CTmax did not match either mean or maximum pond temperatures.

Temperature strongly influences the rates of physiological processes in insects, including the herbivore Manduca sexta and its larval endoparasitoid Cotesia congregata. Parasitisation by C. congregata decreases the growth and consumption of food by larval M. sexta. However, the effects of temperature on parasitised caterpillars and the developing wasp larvae are largely unknown. 2. In this study, parasitised and unparasitised caterpillars were reared at three constant temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) throughout larval development. Caterpillar mass gain and consumption were monitored daily until wandering (unparasitised control group) or wasp emergence (parasitised group) was observed. Development time and survival to emergence were measured as metrics of parasitoid performance. 3. Parasitised M. sexta developed more slowly than unparasitised controls, but had similar cumulative consumption until the terminal instar. Parasitised caterpillars with relatively large parasitoid loads had higher rates of consumption and growth than those with smaller loads. Both temperature and parasitoid load strongly affected wasp success. Mean development time to wasp emergence increased with low temperatures and with large loads. The combination of warm temperature and large parasitoid loads greatly reduced wasp survival. 4. These results demonstrate the interactive effects of rearing temperature and parasitisation on host consumption and growth rates throughout larval development. In addition, wasp performance was affected by the interaction of temperature and parasitoid load size. High temperatures alter the dynamics of the interaction between the parasitoid and its caterpillar host, which could have far-reaching impacts as the global temperatures continue to rise.","[Moore, M.

Thus, adaptation of physiological mechanisms to the thermal environments is important for achieving optimal performance and fitness. The European Common Frog, Rana temporaria, is widely distributed across different thermal habitats. This makes it an exceptional model for studying the adaptations to different thermal conditions. We raised tadpoles from Germany and Croatia at two constant temperature treatments (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C), and under natural temperature fluctuations (in outdoor treatments), and tested how different developmental temperatures affected developmental traits, that is, length of larval development, morphometrics, and body condition, as well as jumping performance of metamorphs. Our results revealed population-specific differences in developmental time, body condition, and jumping performance. Croatian frogs developed faster in all treatments, were heavier, in better body condition, and had longer hind limbs and better jumping abilities than German metamorphs. The populations further differed in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance. While metamorphs from Croatia increased their jumping performance with higher temperatures, German metamorphs reached their performance maximum at lower temperatures. These population-specific differences in common environments indicate local genetic adaptation, with southern populations being better adapted to higher temperatures than those from north of the Alps.","[Drakulic, Sanja; Roedel, Mark-Oliver] Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Feldhaar, Heike; Seiler, Michael] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Bayreuth, Germany; [Lisicic, Duje; Mioc, Mia] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Anim Physiol, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Cizelj, Ivan] Zool Garden Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; [Spatz, Theresa] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Leibniz Institut fur Evolutions und Biodiversitatsforschung; University of Bayreuth; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb, School of Dental Medicine; University of Wurzburg","Rodel, MO (corresponding author), Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.","mo.roedel@mfn-berlin.de","Feldhaar, Heike/AAB-8678-2020; Lisičić, Duje/AAG-7819-2019","Lisičić, Duje/0000-0001-5587-6518; Feldhaar, Heike/0000-0001-6797-5126","German Academic Exchange Service - DAAD; Leibniz Association Open Access Fund","German Academic Exchange Service - DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Leibniz Association Open Access Fund","German Academic Exchange Service - DAAD (Grant/Award Number: Research Grants for Doctoral Candidates and Young Academics and Scientists); Leibniz Association Open Access Fund.",NA,"78","12","13","1","50","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

However, downscaling predicted ecological effects of climate change to local scales and individual species comprises a key knowledge gap. As temperature modifies both abiotic and biotic processes, the fate of refugial populations may depend on interactions of temperature with susceptibility of organisms to other factors, rather than on the impact of temperature alone. To explore this, we examined whether temperature regulates the sensitivity to hypoxia of an aquatic glacial relict, Mysis salemaai, an opossum shrimp. LocationLoughs Oughter, Allen and Derg (field surveys) and Dublin (laboratory experiments), Ireland. MethodsWe used laboratory experiments to determine thermal sensitivity of M.salemaai and quantify the effect of temperature on survival and regulation of aerobic metabolism in progressive hypoxia. The resulting temperature and oxygen sensitivity thresholds were then validated in the field. ResultsSurvival of M.salemaai in reduced oxygen conditions was significantly lower at higher temperatures, even though the tested temperature range did not cause mortality on its own. Results of respiration assays suggest that this was a consequence of impaired capacity at elevated temperatures for regulating oxygen uptake in hypoxic conditions. Main conclusionsOur findings demonstrate that biological effects of climate warming can depend more strongly on interactions of temperature with other factors than on the effects of elevated temperatures alone. Understanding species-specific responses to such interactions is essential to predict future distribution patterns, mitigate threats and prioritize conservation measures aimed at preserving global biodiversity.","[Penk, Marcin; Donohue, Ian; Recoules, Vincent; Irvine, Kenneth] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Dept Zool, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Penk, Marcin; Donohue, Ian] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Trinity Ctr Biodivers Res, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Recoules, Vincent] Ecole Natl Genie Eau & Environm Strasbourg, F-67070 Strasbourg, France; [Irvine, Kenneth] UNESCO IHE Inst Water & Educ, NL-2611 AX Delft, Netherlands","Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin; IHE Delft Institute for Water Education","Penk, M (corresponding author), Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Sch Nat Sci, Zool Bldg, Dublin 2, Ireland.","penkm@tcd.ie","Donohue, Ian/A-7270-2010; Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013","Donohue, Ian/0000-0002-4698-6448; Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064; Penk, Marcin/0000-0001-5619-1991","Irish Research Council; Ecological Consultancy Services Limited","Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); Ecological Consultancy Services Limited","We thank David McKenzie and two anonymous referees for their comments, which helped to improve the quality of the manuscript.

BTR is regulated separately from locomotor activity rhythms, but its molecular basis is largely unknown. While mammals internally regulate BTR, ectotherms, including Drosophila, exhibit temperature preference rhythm (TPR) behavior to regulate BTR. Here, we demonstrate that the diuretic hormone 31 receptor (DH31R) mediates TPR during the active phase in Drosophila. DH31R is expressed in clock cells, and its ligand, DH31, acts on clock cells to regulate TPR during the active phase. Surprisingly, the mouse homolog of DH31R, calcitonin receptor (Calcr), is expressed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and mediates body temperature fluctuations during the active phase in mice. Importantly, DH31R and Calcr are not required for coordinating locomotor activity rhythms. Our results represent the first molecular evidence that BTR is regulated distinctly from locomotor activity rhythms and show that DH31R/Calcr is an ancient specific mediator of BTR during the active phase in organisms ranging from ectotherms to endotherms.","[Goda, Tadahiro; Umezaki, Yujiro; Chu, Michelle L.; Nguyen, Victoria H.; Hamada, Fumika N.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Visual Syst Grp, Abrahamson Pediat Eye Inst, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Doi, Masao; Murai, Iori; Shimatani, Hiroyuki; Okamura, Hitoshi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Syst Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Hamada, Fumika N.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Hamada, Fumika N.] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA","Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Kyoto University; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati","Hamada, FN (corresponding author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Visual Syst Grp, Abrahamson Pediat Eye Inst, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.;Okamura, H (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Syst Biol, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.;Hamada, FN (corresponding author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.;Hamada, FN (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.","okamurah@pharm.kyoto-u.ac.jp; fumika.hamada@cchmc.org","","Nguyen, Victoria/0000-0003-3137-135X; Chu, Michelle/0000-0003-0331-6118; Okamura, Hitoshi/0000-0002-3013-4881","Cincinnati Children's Hospital; March of Dimes; National Institutes of Health grant [R01 GM107582]; JST/Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) [JPMJCR14W3]; Project for Elucidating and Controlling Mechanisms of Aging and Longevity from Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan [15H01843, 15H05933, 17H01524]; Japan Science and Technology (JST)/Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R01GM107582] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Cincinnati Children's Hospital; March of Dimes(March of Dimes); National Institutes of Health grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); JST/Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST)); Project for Elucidating and Controlling Mechanisms of Aging and Longevity from Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)(Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Science and Technology (JST)/Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))","We are grateful to Dr. Paul E.

Our method is based on a first order exponential transformation of a time series of temperatures to yield an exponentially-weighted mean temperature characteristic of the regime and independent of any particular species or end point. The resulting effective temperature or exponential mean, 7, offers an improved method for summarizing mean temperature where biological response scales exponentially to temperature. The exponential mean allows growth under varying thermal regimes to be predicted using constant temperature models and offers a compact descriptor communicating the growth capacity of variable thermal regimes. The method combines mathematical simplicity with translatability to different Q10 values without recourse to the underlining time series data. It also provides a quantitative baseline that improves on mean temperature by incorporating the effect of Jensen's inequality and it remains applicable at near zero temperatures where thermal sums lack accuracy.","[Mitz, Charles; Thome, Christopher] McMaster Univ, Dept Med Phys & Appl Radiat Sci, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada; [Thompson, Jeroen; Boreham, Douglas R.] Bruce Power, POB 1540,177 Tie Rd,R-R-2, Tiverton, ON N0G 2T0, Canada; [Manzon, Richard G.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, 3737 Wascana Pkwy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Wilson, Joanna Y.] McMaster Univ, Dept Biol, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Boreham, Douglas R.] Northern Ontario Sch Med, 935 Ramsey Lake Rd, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada","McMaster University; University of Regina; McMaster University; Northern Ontario School of Medicine","Boreham, DR (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Med Phys & Appl Radiat Sci, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L8, Canada.","charles_mitz@golder.com; cthome@nosm.ca; Jeroen.Thompson@brucepower.com; richard.manzon@uregina.ca; joanna.wilson@mcmaster.ca; dboreham@nosm.ca","","Thome, Christopher/0000-0002-0160-9657","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Bruce Power","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Bruce Power","We are grateful to Bruce Power for its support of this work, both financially and technically, and to grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).",NA,"38","4","4","0","16","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0306-4565","1879-0992","","J THERM BIOL","J.

In addition, we surveyed the literature to review the effect of body mass on core body temperature range in relation to environmental temperature in the Testudinidae. Diurnal activity of tortoises was bimodally distributed and influenced by environmental temperature and season. The mean air temperature at which activity is maximized was 27.9 degrees C, with a range of 25.8-31.7 degrees C. Furthermore, air temperature explained changes in the core body temperature better than did mass, and only during the coldest trial, did tortoises with higher mass show more stable temperatures. Our results, together with the overall Testudinidae overview, suggest that, once variation in environmental temperature has been taken into account, there is little effect of mass on the temperature stability of tortoises. Moreover, the presence of thermal inertia in an individual tortoise depends on the environmental temperatures, and we found no evidence for inertial homeothermy. Finally, patterns of core and external body temperatures in comparison with environmental temperatures suggest that Aldabra giant tortoises act as mixed conformer-regulators. Our study provides a baseline to manage the thermal environment of wild and rewilded populations of an important island ecosystem engineer species in an era of climate change.","[Falcon, Wilfredo; Baxter, Rich P.; Schaepman-Strub, Gabriela; Ozgul, Arpat; Hansen, Dennis M.] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Furrer, Samuel; Bauert, Martin] Zurich Zoo, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hatt, Jean-Michel; Clauss, Marcus] Univ Zurich, Clin Zoo Anim Exot Pets & Wildlife, Vetsuisse Fac, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bunbury, Nancy] Seychelles Isl Fdn, POB 853, Mahe, Seychelles","University of Zurich; University of Zurich","Falcon, W (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.","wilfredo.falcon@ieu.uzh.ch","Schaepman-Strub, Gabriela/D-8785-2011; Clauss, Marcus/A-4710-2008; Clauss, Marcus/M-8702-2019; Clauss, Marcus/GRR-7996-2022; Hansen, Dennis/A-3307-2008","Schaepman-Strub, Gabriela/0000-0002-4069-1884; Clauss, Marcus/0000-0003-3841-6207; Clauss, Marcus/0000-0003-3841-6207; Clauss, Marcus/0000-0003-3841-6207; Hatt, Jean-Michel/0000-0002-7043-7430; Ozgul, Arpat/0000-0001-7477-2642; Hansen, Dennis/0000-0002-9584-2766; Falcon, Wilfredo/0000-0003-2438-5681","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [31003A_143940]","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF))","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: 31003A_143940",NA,"62","14","14","2","26","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Few studies have examined whether ectotherms acclimate to diurnal temperature fluctuations, or how natural and domesticated populations differ in their responses to diurnal fluctuations. We examine how diurnally fluctuating temperatures during development affect growth, acclimation, and stress responses for two populations of Manduca sexta: a field population that typically experiences wide variation in mean and fluctuations in temperature, and a laboratory population that has been domesticated in nearly constant temperatures for more than 300 generations. Laboratory experiments showed that diurnal fluctuations throughout larval development reduced pupal mass for the laboratory but not the field population. The differing effects of diurnal fluctuations were greatest at higher mean temperature (30 degrees C): Here diurnal fluctuations reduced pupal mass and increased pupal development time for the laboratory population, but had little effect for the field population. We also evaluated how mean and fluctuations in temperature during early larval development affected growth rate during the final larval instar as a function of test temperature. At an intermediate (25 degrees C) mean temperature, both the laboratory and field population showed a positive acclimation response to diurnal fluctuations, in which subsequent growth rate was significantly higher at most test temperatures. In contrast at higher mean temperature (30 degrees C), diurnal fluctuations significantly reduced subsequent growth rate at most test temperatures for the laboratory population, but not for the field population. These results suggest that during domestication in constant temperatures, the laboratory population has lost the capacity to tolerate or acclimate to high and fluctuating temperatures. Population differences in acclimation capacity in response to temperature fluctuations have not been previously demonstrated, but they may be important for understanding the evolution of reaction norms and performance curves.","[Kingsolver, Joel G.; Moore, M.

The goal of this study was to investigate the stability of body temperature in large fish using data from field experiments. We measured the muscle temperatures of free-ranging whale sharks (Rhincodon typus), the largest extant fish globally, and investigated their ectothermic physiology and the stability of their body temperature. The muscle temperature changed substantially more slowly than the water temperature fluctuations associated with vertical movements, and the whole-body heat-transfer coefficients (HTCs) of whale sharks estimated using heat-budget models were lower than those of any other fish species measured to date. The heat-budget models also showed that internal heat production does not contribute to changes in muscle temperature. A comparative analysis showed that the HTC at cooling in various fish species including both ectothermic and endothermic species ranging from 10(-4) to 10(3) kg was proportional to body mass(-0.63). This allometry was present regardless of whether the fish were ectothermic or endothermic, and was an extension of the relationship observed in previous studies on small fish. Thus, large fish have the advantage of body temperature stability while moving in environments with large temperature variations. Our results suggest that the large body size of whale sharks aids in preventing a decrease in body temperature during deep excursions to more than 1000 m depths without high metabolic costs of producing heat.","[Nakamura, Itsumi] Nagasaki Univ, Org Marine Sci & Technol, 1551-7 Tairamachi, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan; [Matsumoto, Rui] Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium, 888 Ishikawa, Motobu, Okinawa 9050206, Japan; [Sato, Katsufumi] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan","Nagasaki University; University of Tokyo","Nakamura, I (corresponding author), Nagasaki Univ, Org Marine Sci & Technol, 1551-7 Tairamachi, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan.","itsumi@nagasaki-u.ac.jp","","Nakamura, Itsumi/0000-0002-1386-7266","Bio-Logging Science; University of Tokyo (UTBLS); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [16J00837, 17H00776]; CREST funding program from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) [JPMJCR13A5]","Bio-Logging Science; University of Tokyo (UTBLS); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); CREST funding program from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)","This study was funded by the Bio-Logging Science, the University of Tokyo (UTBLS), Grant-in-Aids for JSPS Fellows from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) (16J00837, 17H00776), and the CREST funding program from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) (JPMJCR13A5).",NA,"62","20","21","6","40","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

In this study, we evaluated the impact of three constant thermal regimes (7, 12, and 17 degrees C) and one fluctuating thermal regime (7-17 degrees C with a mean of 12 degrees C) on fitness indicators in the rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea, a major pest of apple orchards, and the parasitoid Aphidius matricariae, one of its natural enemies used in mass release biological control strategies. For some-but not all-traits, the fluctuating 7-17 degrees C regime was beneficial to insects compared to the constant 12 degrees C regime. Both aphid and parasitoid development times were shortened under the fluctuating regime, and there was a clear trend towards an increased longevity under the fluctuating regime. The fecundity, mass, and size were affected by the mean temperature, but only the mass of aphids was higher at 7-17 degrees C than at a constant 12 degrees C. Parasitism rates, but not emergence rates, were higher under the fluctuating regime than under the constant 12 degrees C regime. Results are discussed within the framework of insect thermal ecology and Jensen's inequality. We conclude that incorporating thermal fluctuations in ecological studies could allow for the more accurate consideration of how temperature affects host-parasitoid interactions and insect responses to temperature change over time.","[Tougeron, Kevin; Ferrais, Louise; Renard, Marie-Eve; Hance, Thierry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Ecol & Biodivers, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Tougeron, Kevin] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, UMR CNRS 7058 EDYSAN, Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises, F-80000 Amiens, France","Universite Catholique Louvain; Picardie Universites; Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV)","Tougeron, K (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Ecol & Biodivers, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.;Tougeron, K (corresponding author), Univ Picardie Jules Verne, UMR CNRS 7058 EDYSAN, Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropises, F-80000 Amiens, France.","tougeron.kevin@gmail.com; louise.ferrais@uclouvain.be; marie-eve.renard@uclouvain.be; thierry.hance@uclouvain.be","","Tougeron, Kevin/0000-0003-4897-3787","FEDER-Interreg PROVERBIO project; F.R.S.-FNRS","FEDER-Interreg PROVERBIO project; F.R.S.-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS)","This work is part of the FEDER-Interreg PROVERBIO project (1.1.359), by which L.F. was supported.

Previous studies revealed that the phonotactic preference of female frogs was affected by temperature fluctuations; however, the corresponding plasticity of peripheral auditory sensitivity is unclear. In the present study, the auditory sensitivity of little torrent frogs (Amolops torrentis) was tested by auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) in both natural warm and cold conditions. The threshold and latency of the ABRs evoked by tone pips ranging from 1.0-7.0 kHz and clicks were compared between these two conditions. The results showed that ABR thresholds were higher and latencies were longer at cold compared to those at warm temperatures for relatively low frequencies (1.8-2.6 kHz), while no significant differences existed at relatively high frequencies (3.0-7.0 kHz). Our previous study showed that the best hearing frequency range of the little torrent frog is 1.6-2.0 kHz, whereas females behaviourally prefer higher frequencies (4.3 kHz). These results indicate that temperature fluctuations in natural habitats can change auditory sensitivity around the best hearing range (1.6-2.0 kHz), while they do not affect the female-preferred frequency range (4.3 kHz). Our results demonstrate that auditory frequency sensitivity exhibits diurnal temperature-dependent plastic changes, which may be adaptive for diurnal reproductive behaviour in this species.","[Sun, Xiaodian; Zhao, Longhui; Cui, Jianguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xiaodian; Zhao, Longhui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Longhui] Sichuan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qinghua] Minist Ecol & Environm, South China Inst Environm Sci, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jichao] Hainan Normal Univ, Dept Biol, Haikou, Hainan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Sichuan University; Hainan Normal University","Cui, JG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.","cuijg@cib.ac.cn","cui, Jianguo/AAV-1184-2021","cui, Jianguo/0000-0001-8746-2803","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31772464]; CAS 'Light of West China' Program [2016XBZG_XBQNXZ_A1_003]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2012274]; Biodiversity Survey and Assessment Project of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China [2019HJ2096001006]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS 'Light of West China' Program; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Biodiversity Survey and Assessment Project of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [31772464]; CAS 'Light of West China' Program [2016XBZG_XBQNXZ_A1_003]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2012274]; the Biodiversity Survey and Assessment Project of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China [2019HJ2096001006].",NA,"46","5","5","1","10","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0952-4622","2165-0586","","BIOACOUSTICS","Bioacoustics","NOV 1","2020","29","6","",NA,"",NA,"684","696","","10.1080/09524622.2019.1662845","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2019.1662845","","SEP 2019","13","Zoology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Zoology","OQ9LK",NA,"Green Submitted","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000486640600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Numerous studies examined the effects of incubation temperature or ambient temperature on various aspects of offspring phenotype. We investigated whether incubation temperature and ambient temperature have an interactive effect on offspring performance. Our study animal, the ectothermic vertebrate Lampropholis delicata (common garden skink; De Vis 1888), experiences fluctuating environmental temperatures caused by differential invasion of an exotic plant Vinca major (blue periwinkle). In the laboratory, eggs from wild-caught females were assigned to different incubation temperatures that mimicked variation in natural nests. The feeding performance and digestion time of each hatchling was tested at ambient temperatures that represented environments invaded to different degrees by periwinkle. Incubation and ambient temperature interacted to affect a lizard's mobility, the time that it took to capture, subdue and handle a prey, and the number of handling 'errors' that it made while foraging. For a number of these characteristics, incubation-induced changes to a lizard's mass significantly affected this relationship. Irrespective of size, no interaction effect was found for digestion time: lizards digested food faster at warmer temperatures, regardless of incubation temperature. Thus, temperatures experienced during incubation may alter an animal's phenotype so that the surrounding thermal environment differentially affects aspects of feeding performance. Our results also demonstrate that incubation environment can induce changes to morphology and behaviour that carry over into a lizard's early life, and that in some cases these differences in phenotype interact to affect performance. We suggest that the immediate removal of exotic plants as part of a weed control strategy could have important implications for the foraging performance, and presumably fitness, of ectothermic animals.","Univ Antwerp VIB, Lab Funct Morphol, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; Australian Natl Univ, Sch Bot & Zool, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Flanders Institute for Biotechnology (VIB); University of Antwerp; Australian National University","Bilcke, J (corresponding author), A Hanslaan 4, B-2550 Kontich, Belgium.","jokebilcke@yahoo.com","Bilcke, Joke M/A-7082-2012; Downes, Sharon Joy/C-1770-2008; Bilcke, Joke/AAC-8932-2019","Downes, Sharon Joy/0000-0002-3729-1732; Bilcke, Joke/0000-0001-5720-5291","","","",NA,"52","5","5","0","31","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","OXFORD","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","1442-9985","","","AUSTRAL ECOL","Austral Ecol.","DEC","2006","31","8","",NA,"",NA,"937","947","","10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01663.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2006.01663.x","","","11","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","104JP",NA,"","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000241955000003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, mosquitoes, and parasites within them, do not experience 'average temperatures', but are exposed to temperatures that can fluctuate considerably throughout the day. In addition, endophilic mosquitoes will be exposed to indoor temperatures and not directly to outdoor air temperature. Further, mosquito larvae live in aquatic habitats and so again, are not exposed directly to outdoor air temperatures. In this chapter we highlight how these different temperatures can all change malaria risk predictions. To understand malaria dynamics, inform operational control objectives and predict consequences of climate change, we need a better mechanistic understanding of vector-parasite interactions, with improved integration of the biological and environmental parameters at a scale relevant to conditions actually experienced by both mosquitoes and malaria parasites.","[Paaijmans, Krijn P.; Thomas, Matthew B.] Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, Merkle Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Paaijmans, Krijn P.; Thomas, Matthew B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, Merkle Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Paaijmans, KP (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, Merkle Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","krijn@paaijmans.nl; mbt13@psu.edu","Paaijmans, Krijn/ABC-9928-2020","","","","",NA,"83","8","8","0","9","WAGENINGEN ACAD PUBL","WAGENINGEN","POSTBUS 220, 6700 AE WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS","1875-0699","","978-90-8686-744-8; 978-90-8686-188-0","ECOL CONT VECTOR-BOR","","","2013","3","","",NA,"",NA,"103","121","","","","10.3920/978-90-8686-744-8","","19","Entomology; Infectious Diseases; Parasitology","Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)","Entomology; Infectious Diseases; Parasitology","BGX28",NA,"","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000324484700006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This species also has many adaptations to living in an arid environment characterized by seasonal extremes in temperature and resource availability. By housing G. agassizii at a controlled, constant ambient temperature, we quantified predominantly temperature-independent, seasonal fluctuations in innate immune function and circulating leukocytes in a reptile. We found a decrease in bacteriocidal activity of the blood plasma in winter, with reduced function lasting into the spring. Lymphocyte numbers were elevated in fall and winter, whereas eosinophil numbers increased in summer. Thus, properties of the immune system were up- or down-regulated in different directions across the seasons. We found a much higher level of variation of leukocyte profiles among individuals than has previously been reported for other chelonians. Heterophil: lymphocyte ratios (indicative of chronic glucocorticoid levels) were not associated with any measure of immune function, and thus glucocorticoid does not seem to mediate the observed seasonal changes. We propose a new hypothesis to explain seasonal changes in immune function, based on seasonal resource limitation in the Mojave Desert, including the availability of dietary protein, energy, and opportunities for thermal regulation.","[Sandmeier, F.

Most studies analyzing malaria-temperature relations, including those investigating malaria risk and the possible impacts of climate change, are based solely on mean temperatures and extrapolate from functions determined under unrealistic laboratory conditions. Here, we present empirical evidence to show that, in addition to mean temperatures, daily fluctuations in temperature affect parasite infection, the rate of parasite development, and the essential elements of mosquito biology that combine to determine malaria transmission intensity. In general, we find that, compared with rates at equivalent constant mean temperatures, temperature fluctuation around low mean temperatures acts to speed up rate processes, whereas fluctuation around high mean temperatures acts to slow processes down. At the extremes (conditions representative of the fringes of malaria transmission, where range expansions or contractions will occur), fluctuation makes transmission possible at lower mean temperatures than currently predicted and can potentially block transmission at higher mean temperatures. If we are to optimize control efforts and develop appropriate adaptation or mitigation strategies for future climates, we need to incorporate into predictive models the effects of daily temperature variation and how that variation is altered by climate change.","[Paaijmans, Krijn P.; Blanford, Simon; Read, Andrew F.; Thomas, Matthew B.] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Blanford, Simon; Bell, Andrew S.; Read, Andrew F.] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Blanford, Justine I.] Penn State Univ, Dept Geog, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Blanford, Justine I.] Penn State Univ, GeoVISTA Ctr, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Read, Andrew F.] NIH, Fogarty Int Ctr, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; National Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA; NIH Fogarty International Center (FIC)","Thomas, MB (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","mbt13@psu.edu","Paaijmans, Krijn/ABC-9928-2020","Blanford, Justine/0000-0003-0844-9390","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO))","We thank B.

Trophic (consumer-resource) interactions, which comprise the fundamental units (modules) of food webs, are of particular importance because they have an intrinsic tendency to fluctuate in abundance, thus running to risk of stochastic extinction during periods of low abundances. Here I present a mathematical framework for predicting warming effects on consumer-resource interactions. This work differs from previous theory in two ways. First, it uses delay differential equations to realistically depict the developmental delays inherent in ectotherm life cycles, and incorporates mechanistic descriptions of phenotypic trait responses, derived from first principles of thermodynamics, into the dynamical delay model. Second, it tests the latest IPCC predictions on warmer-than-average winters and hotter-than-average summers. I investigate warming effects on three major axes: latitude (tropical vs. temperate), life stage attacked (juvenile vs. adult), and nature of consumer-resource dynamics in the absence of temperature variation (stable vs. complex). I report three findings. First, consumer-resource interactions in the tropics are more at risk of species losses due to warming while those in the temperate zone are more at risk of extreme fluctuations in species' abundances. Second, effects of warming are more detrimental when the consumer attacks the adult stage of the resource and when consumer-resource interactions exhibit complex dynamics. Third, hotter-than-average summers are more detrimental to consumer-resource interactions than warmer-than-average winters. I discuss implications of these results for biodiversity and biological pest control.","[Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","amarasek@ucla.edu","","","James S.

This review and synthesis describes how the effects of thermal variation-in both time and space-can be estimated by applying a simple, nonlinear averaging scheme. The method is first applied to the temporal variation experienced by an individual, providing an estimate of the individual's average performance. The method is then applied to the scale-dependent thermal variation among individuals, which is modelled as a 1/f-noise phenomenon. For an individual, thermal variation reduces average performance, lowers the temperature of maximum performance (T-opt) and contracts the range of viable temperatures. Thermal variation among individuals similarly reduces performance and lowers T-opt, but increases the viable range of average temperatures. These results must be viewed with caution, however, because they do not take into account the time-dependent interaction between body temperature and physiological plasticity. Quantifying these interactions is perhaps the largest challenge for ecological and conservation physiologists as they attempt to predict the effects of climate change.","[Denny, Mark] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, 120 Ocean View Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA","Stanford University","Denny, M (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, 120 Ocean View Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.","mwdenny@stanford.edu","","Denny, Mark/0000-0003-0277-9022","National Science Foundation [IOS-16555529]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported by National Science Foundation grant IOS-16555529 to the author.",NA,"51","15","15","2","9","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2051-1434","","","CONSERV PHYSIOL","Conserv.

There is a growing consensus about the importance of considering the temperature fluctuations as a mechanism improving organism's performance. Tadpoles are small body size ectotherm organisms that behave isothermally with their environment. As such, are good models for studying their thermal biology relative to their immediate environment. We studied six anuran tadpole species in North Patagonia, Alsodes gargola, Hylorina sylvatica, Batrachyla taeniata, Pleurodema thaul, P. bufoninum and Rhinella spinulosa, distributed in a West-East altitudinal cline with different environments and thermal conditions. We evaluated the relationship between thermal descriptors at a local scale and the thermal biology patterns of these temperate tadpoles. We estimated thermal tolerance limits and thermal sensitivity of locomotion of each species. The different aquatic environments showed important differences in local thermal conditions, associated with observed differences in the thermal traits in these tadpoles. Species exposed to lower temperature fluctuations and lower environmental mean temperatures showed lower swimming optimal temperatures and narrower thermal tolerance ranges. We found greater variability in the upper than in the lower critical limits in these Patagonian anuran tadpoles. Minimum critical temperatures were close to freezing temperature, possibly in detriment of their tolerance to high temperatures. Overall, our results suggest that these species are adapted to low temperatures. Finally, warming tolerances and predicted thermal safety margins, show that none of the studied species appear to be under thermal stress that may compromise their survival at the present time or in the near future, under a moderate climate change scenario.","[Fabian Bonino, Marcelo; Benjamin Cruz, Felix; Gabriela Perotti, Maria] CONICET UNCOMA, Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Medioambiente INIBIOM, Lab Ecol Biol Evolut & Comportamiento Herpetozoos, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional del Comahue","Bonino, MF (corresponding author), CONICET UNCOMA, Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Medioambiente INIBIOM, Lab Ecol Biol Evolut & Comportamiento Herpetozoos, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.","boninom@comahue-conicet.gob.ar","","","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT 2015-0436, PICT 2015-3001]; CONICET","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica(ANPCyT); CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET))","We thank the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their helpful feedback on the manuscript.

When eggs of ectotherms are exposed to large temperature fluctuations, egg phenotypes and post-hatching traits may be altered, but little relevant information is available on insects. Hence, we simulated a set of natural diurnal temperature fluctuations each with the same mean temperature (25 +/- 0, 25 +/- 2, 25 +/- 4, 25 +/- 6, 25 +/- 8, 25 +/- 10 degrees C), to which we exposed the eggs of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), and assessed subsequent egg development, survival and post-hatching traits. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in these phenomena between the constant temperature treatment and the treatments with moderate temperature fluctuations. However, large temperature fluctuations slowed development and lowered hatching rate during the egg stage. In addition the effects of these large temperature fluctuations extended to the larval stage, but not to the pupal and adult stages. No apparent costs of compensatory responses, which occurred in the larval stage, were detected in the later stages. These findings indicate that fluctuating temperature effects are potentially important in predicting insect phenology and population dynamics. As an independent factor, the effects of temperature fluctuations on a stage in the life history must be factored into models for predicting insect development that are based on mean temperatures. The larger of the temperature fluctuations to which eggs of diamondback moth were exposed, affected development time, hatching rate, larval growth and pre-pupal mass.","[Xing, Kun; Han, Jv-Cai] Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Taigu 030801, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Xing, Kun; Zhao, Fei] Shanxi Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Shanxi Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Agr, Taiyuan 030031, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Ma, Chun-Sen] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Climate Change Biol Res Grp, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Shanxi Agricultural University; Shanxi Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Plant Protection, CAAS","Zhao, F (corresponding author), Shanxi Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Shanxi Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Agr, Taiyuan 030031, Shanxi, Peoples R China.","zhaofei12@126.com; sxndhjc@163.com","赵, 飞/AAC-8601-2019; Ma, Chun-Sen/K-5414-2019","Ma, Chun-Sen/0000-0002-3253-6921; Zhao, Fei/0000-0003-4158-3604","","","",NA,"51","17","18","4","35","FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC","LUTZ","16125 E LAKE BURRELL DR, LUTZ, FL 33548 USA","0015-4040","1938-5102","","FLA ENTOMOL","Fla.

Increases in extreme temperature fluctuations and average temperatures can cause stress, particularly in aquatic sessile ectotherms such as freshwater mussels. However, some species seem to thrive more than others in face of temperature-related stressors. Thermal tolerance may, for example, explain the success of invasive species. It is also known that mitochondria can play a key role in setting an ectothermic species' thermal tolerance. In this study, we aimed to characterize the mitochondrial thermo-tolerance in invasive and endemic freshwater mussels. With the use of high-resolution respirometry, we analyzed the mitochondrial respiration of two freshwater bivalve species exposed to a broad range of temperatures. We noticed that the invasive dreissenid Dreissena bugensis possessed a less thermo-tolerant mitochondrial metabolism than the endemic unionid Elliptio complanata. This lack of tolerance was linked with a more noticeable aerobic metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. This decrease in mitochondrial metabolic activity was also linked with an increase in leak oxygen consumption as well as a stable maintenance of the activity of cytochrome c oxidase in both species. These findings may be associated both with the species' life history characteristics, as D. bugensis is more adapted to unstable habitats, in which selection pressures for resistance adaptations are reduced. Our findings add to the growing body of literature characterizing the mitochondrial metabolism of many aquatic ectotherms in our changing world.","[Hraoui, Georges; Bettinazzi, Stefano; Boisclair, Daniel; Breton, Sophie] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Pavillon Marie Victorin,90 Vincent DIndy, Montreal, PQ H2V 2S9, Canada; [Hraoui, Georges; Boisclair, Daniel; Breton, Sophie] Univ Montreal, GRIL, Pavillon Marie Victorin,90 Vincent DIndy, Montreal, PQ H2V 259, Canada; [Gendron, Andree D.] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Water Sci & Technol Directorate, Aquat Contaminants Res Div, 105 McGill, Montreal, PQ H2Y 2E5, Canada","Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Environment & Climate Change Canada","Hraoui, G; Breton, S (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Pavillon Marie Victorin,90 Vincent DIndy, Montreal, PQ H2V 2S9, Canada.;Hraoui, G; Breton, S (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, GRIL, Pavillon Marie Victorin,90 Vincent DIndy, Montreal, PQ H2V 259, Canada.","georgehraoti@yahoo.ca; s.breton@umontreal.ca","; Boisclair, Daniel/AAS-2345-2020","Hraoui, Georges/0000-0002-5475-9915; Boisclair, Daniel/0000-0002-4353-9597; Bettinazzi, Stefano/0000-0002-1129-0678","National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Groupe de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Limnologie","National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Groupe de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Limnologie","This study was funded by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Groupe de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Limnologie.",NA,"57","8","8","2","20","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that time-averaged population growth rates in fluctuating thermal environments differ from growth rates in constant conditions as a consequence of Jensen's inequality, and that the thermal performance curves (TPCs) describing population growth in fluctuating environments can be predicted quantitatively based on TPCs generated in constant laboratory conditions. With experimental populations of the green alga Tetraselmis tetrahele, we show that nonlinear averaging techniques accurately predicted increased as well as decreased population growth rates in fluctuating thermal regimes relative to constant thermal regimes.

Ectotherms rely on behavioral and physiological plasticity to contend with environmental fluctuations. Nonetheless, our understanding of thermal plasticity has been largely limited to laboratory settings. Here, we test whether aspects of thermal physiology respond to interannual shifts in thermal environment in a natural population of Phrynosoma orbiculare, a montane horned lizard, from Hidalgo, Mexico. At our field site, 2019 was markedly warmer than the year that preceded it. We detected population-level increases in three key thermal physiological traits: preferred temperature, the critical thermal minimum, and the critical thermal maximum. Thus, thermal phenotypes appear to shift in tandem in response to environmental fluctuations. A subset of individuals were resampled across years, allowing insight into plastic shifts within an organism's lifetime. We detected parallel increases in these lizards for the preferred temperature and the critical thermal minimum, but not for the critical thermal maximum. Our results support a growing body of literature indicating that preferred conditions and cold tolerance can be highly labile over the course of an organism's lifetime, whereas hardening over shorter time periods is more common for heat tolerance. Given that heat tolerance increased at the population-level, but not in resampled individuals, it is possible that rapid evolution occurred due to temperature increases. In short, physiological shifts can be observed in natural populations over relatively short timespans, and these shifts might reflect a combination of evolutionary and acclimatory responses.","[Dominguez-Guerrero, Saul F.; Bodensteiner, Brooke L.; Munoz, Martha M.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Dominguez-Guerrero, Saul F.; Mendez-de la Cruz, Fausto R.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, Lab Herpetol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Dominguez-Guerrero, Saul F.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Biol, Posgrad Ciencias Biol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Pardo-Ramirez, Alexis] Univ Juarez Estado Durango, Fac Ciencias Biol, Gomez Palacio, Durango, Mexico; [Aguillon-Gutierrez, David R.] Univ Autonoma Coahuila, Ctr Invest & Jardin Etnobiol, Viesca, Coahuila, Mexico","Yale University; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Juarez del Estado de Durango; Universidad Autonoma de Coahuila","Dominguez-Guerrero, SF; Bodensteiner, BL (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.","sauldguerrero@gmail.com; brooke.bodensteiner@yale.edu","","","Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas-UNAM; Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CVU 4782892]; PAPIIT-UNAM [IN212119]","Posgrado en Ciencias Biologicas-UNAM(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); Comision Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); PAPIIT-UNAM(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT)Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico)","We thank R.

However, the extent of lipid remodeling and the associated fitness consequences under continuous temperature fluctuations are not well-described. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of repeated temperature fluctuations on fatty acid composition and thermal tolerance. We exposed the springtail Orchesella cincta to two constant temperatures of 5 and 20 degrees C, and a continuously fluctuating treatment between 5 and 20 degrees C every 2 days. Fatty acid composition differed significantly between constant low and high temperatures. As expected, animals were most cold tolerant in the low temperature treatment, while heat tolerance was highest under high temperature. Under fluctuating temperatures, fatty acid composition changed with temperature initially, but later in the experiment fatty acid composition stabilized and closely resembled that found under constant warm temperatures. Consistent with this, heat tolerance in the fluctuating temperature treatment was comparable to the constant warm treatment. Cold tolerance in the fluctuating temperature treatment was intermediate compared to animals acclimated to constant cold or warmth, despite the fact that fatty acid composition was adjusted to warm conditions. This unexpected finding suggests that in animals acclimated to fluctuating temperatures an additional underlying mechanism is involved in the cold shock response. Other aspects of homeoviscous adaptation may protect animals during extreme cold. This paper forms a next step to fully understand the functioning of ectotherms in more thermally variable environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the differential effects of single, repeated or continuous exposure to high temperatures are less clear. We measured the effects of single heat shocks and of diurnally fluctuating or constant rearing temperatures on the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) for final instar larvae of Manduca sexta. Brief (2 h) heat shocks at temperatures of 35 degrees C and above significantly increased CTmax relative to control temperatures (25 degrees C). Increasing mean temperatures (from 25 to 30 degrees C) or greater diurnal fluctuations (from constant to +/- 10 degrees C) during larval development also significantly increased CTmax. Combining these data showed that repeated or continuous temperature exposure during development improved heat tolerance beyond the effects of a single exposure to the same maximum temperature.

Not only average daily temperature, but also diurnal temperature variations may affect prey consumption and life history traits of ectotherms. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of temperature alternations on body size, predation capacity and oviposition rate of the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) when presented with eggs of their natural prey, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). For both predators, mean daily temperature as well as temperature alternation had a substantial impact on the number of prey consumed. At lower average temperatures, more eggs were killed under an alternating temperature regime (20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C and 25 A degrees C/10 A degrees C) than at the corresponding mean constant temperatures (15 and 20 A degrees C). At higher average temperatures (> 25 A degrees C), however, the opposite was observed with higher numbers of prey killed at constant temperatures than at alternating temperatures. At 25 A degrees C, temperature variation had no effect on the predation capacity. A similar trend as for the predation rates was observed for the oviposition rates of the phytoseiids. Body size of N. californicus was affected both by average daily temperature and temperature variation, with smaller adult females emerging at alternating temperatures than at constant temperatures, whereas for P. persimilis, temperature variation had no impact on its body size. Our results demonstrate that temperature variations are likely to affect biological control of T. urticae by the studied phytoseiid predators.","[Vangansbeke, Dominiek; Duc Tung Nguyen; Tirry, Luc; De Clercq, Patrick] Univ Ghent, Dept Crop Protect, Lab Agrozool, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Duc Tung Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Dept Entomol, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Audenaert, Joachim; Verhoeven, Ruth; Gobin, Bruno] PCS Ornamental Plant Res, B-9070 Destelbergen, Belgium","Ghent University; Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA)","Vangansbeke, D (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Crop Protect, Lab Agrozool, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Dominiek.Vangansbeke@ugent.be; ductunghau@gmail.com; Joachim.Audenaert@pcsierteelt.be; Ruth.Verhoeven@pcsierteelt.be; Bruno.Gobin@pcsierteelt.be; Luc.Tirry@ugent.be; Patrick.Declercq@ugent.be","De Clercq, Patrick/B-5721-2015; Nguyen, Duc Tung/P-1316-2017","De Clercq, Patrick/0000-0003-0664-1602; Nguyen, Duc Tung/0000-0002-8954-3604","Institute for Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen) [090931]","Institute for Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen)(Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT))","This research was supported by project number 090931 from the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen).",NA,"60","10","10","0","50","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1386-6141","1573-8248","","BIOCONTROL","Biocontrol","OCT","2015","60","5","",NA,"",NA,"595","603","","10.1007/s10526-015-9677-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-015-9677-0","","","9","Entomology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Entomology","CR0HR",NA,"","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000360999800002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Heat-transfermodels describe how the fish's internal temperature responds to a fluctuating thermal environment. Specifically, the rate coefficient (k), defined as the instantaneous rate of change in body temperature in relation to the difference between ambient and body temperature, summarizes the combined effects of direct thermal conduction through body mass, passive convection (intracellular and intercellular fluids) and forced convective heat transfer (cardiovascular system). The k-coefficient is widely used in fish ecology to understand howbody temperature responds to changes in water temperature. The main objective of this study was to estimate the k-coefficient of brook charr equipped with internal temperature-sensitive transmitters in controlled laboratory experiments. Fish were first transferred from acclimation tanks (10 degrees C) to tanks at 14, 19 or 23 degrees C (warming experiments) and were then returned to the acclimation tanks (10 degrees C; cooling experiments), thus producing six step changes in ambient temperature. We used non-linear mixed models to estimate the k-coefficient. Model comparisons indicated that the model incorporating the k-coefficient as a function of absolute temperature difference (dT: 4, 9 and 13 degrees C) best described body temperature change. By simulating body temperature in a heterogeneous thermal environment, we provide theoretical predictions of maximum excursion duration between feeding and resting areas. Our simulations suggest that short (i.e. <60 min) excursions could be a common thermoregulatory behaviour adopted by cold freshwater fish species to sustain body temperature below a critical temperature threshold, enabling them to exploit resources in an unfavourable thermal environment.","[Pepino, Marc] Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ctr Rech Interact Bassins Versants Ecosyst Aquat, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada; Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Grp Rech Interuniv Limnol & Environm Aquat GRIL, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada","University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Trois Rivieres","Pepino, M (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Trois Rivieres, Ctr Rech Interact Bassins Versants Ecosyst Aquat, CP 500, Trois Rivieres, PQ G9A 5H7, Canada.","marc.pepino@uqtr.ca","Magnan, Pierre/U-9342-2019","Magnan, Pierre/0000-0003-3122-7163","National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Research Chair Program","National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Canada Research Chair Program(Canada Research Chairs)","This work was supported by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Canada Research Chair Program to P.M.",NA,"46","15","15","0","33","COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

Temperatures are expected to continue to rise in the future, along with a greater degree of climatic instability. Such changes could have potentially serious consequences for oviparous ectotherms, especially those with temperature-dependent sex determination. To investigate the effects of temperature on a range of developmental phenomena in a population of western pond turtles (Emys marmorata), we placed temperature sensors on top of each layer of eggs within nests and recorded temperatures hourly through the first 2-3 mo of incubation. These methods allowed us to look at in situ nest temperatures with high resolution. We found that mean incubation temperatures were similar between different nests and at different levels within nests but that incubation temperature fluctuations and maximum incubation temperatures differed greatly in both cases. The hatchling turtles were more likely to be female if they spent 30% or more of their sex-determining period of incubation above 29 degrees C. Hatching success was best predicted by the maximum incubation temperature. We also found that incubation duration tended to be shorter as the mean temperature increased. However, exposure to either extremely high or low temperatures extended incubation times.","[Christie, Nicole E.; Geist, Nicholas R.] Sonoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA","California State University System; Sonoma State University","Christie, NE (corresponding author), Sonoma State Univ, Dept Biol, Rohnert Pk, CA 94928 USA.","nicolechristie10@gmail.com","","","Association of Zoos and Aquariums; Sonoma County Fish and Wildlife Commission; Coyote Point Museum Foundation; Sonoma State University Office of Research and Sponsored Programs","Association of Zoos and Aquariums; Sonoma County Fish and Wildlife Commission; Coyote Point Museum Foundation; Sonoma State University Office of Research and Sponsored Programs","We thank the following for their contributions to this project: the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the Sonoma County Fish and Wildlife Commission, the Coyote Point Museum Foundation, and the Sonoma State University Office of Research and Sponsored Programs for funding.

Extending this theory, we show that yearly temperature cycles reduce metabolic rates of taxa having short generation times. This reduction is due to Jensen's inequality, which results from a nonlinear dependency of metabolic rate of organisms on temperature. It leads to a prediction that relatively lower species richness is found in habitats with larger amplitudes of yearly temperature cycles where mean temperatures and other conditions are similar. We show that metabolically driven generation time of a taxon also relates functionally to species richness, and similarly, its yearly cycles reduce richness. We test these hypotheses on marine calanoid copepods with 46,377 records of data collected by scientific cruise surveys in Mediterranean regions, across which the temperature amplitudes vary dramatically. We test both bio-energetic and phenomenological effects of temperature cycles on richness in 86 1A degrees A x 1A degrees latitudinal and longitudinal spatial units. The models incorporated the effect of both periodic fluctuations and mean temperature explained 21.6% more variation in the data, with lower AIC, compared to models incorporated only the mean temperature. The study also gives insight into the basis of energetic-equivalence rule in MTE determining richness, which can be governed by generation time of taxon. The results of this study lead to the proposition that amplitude of yearly temperature cycles may contribute to both the longitudinal and the latitudinal differences in species richness and show how the metabolic theory can explain macro-ecological patterns arising from yearly temperature cycles.","[Rajakaruna, Harshana] Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Math Biol Unit, Okinawa, Japan; [Lewis, Mark] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Math Biol, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Lewis, Mark] Univ Alberta, Dept Math & Stat Sci, Ctr Math Biol, Edmonton, AB, Canada","Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology Graduate University; University of Alberta; University of Alberta","Rajakaruna, H (corresponding author), Grad Univ, Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol, Math Biol Unit, Okinawa, Japan.","hrajakar@utk.edu; mark.lewis@ualberta.ca","Rajakaruna, Harshana/AAF-9456-2019; Lewis, Mark A/C-5015-2008","Lewis, Mark A/0000-0002-7155-7426","Mathematical Biology Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) of Japan; NSERC","Mathematical Biology Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) of Japan; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","The authors thank the anonymous reviewers of the manuscript greatly.

Ectotherms typically counteract this temperature effect by remodeling membrane lipids as stipulated in the homeoviscous adaptation theory (HVA). Previous studies mostly focused on the remodeling of membrane lipids during long-term acclimatization or acclimation at constant temperature regimes, whereas in nature, many organisms experience variations in temperature on a daily basis and must react to this changing thermal environment. The objective of this study was to examine the composition of membrane lipids in oysters subjected to long-term acclimation at constant temperatures (12 or 25 degrees C) or to enviromnentally realistic daily fluctuations in temperature between 12 and 25 degrees C for 7 d. The lipid composition of gill in oysters subjected to long-term acclimation at a constant temperature or to daily temperature fluctuations varied in a way consistent with HVA: oysters adjusted their phospholipid to sterol ratio in response to long-term acclimation to a constant temperature but not to daily temperature fluctuations. In contrast, the unsaturation index of polar lipids in oysters varied in response to both long-term acclimation to a constant temperature and to daily temperature fluctuations, mainly due to changes in 22:6n-3 and 20:5n-3. The 20:4n-6 levels in oyster gills increased as temperature rose, suggesting as increasing availability of this fatty acid for eicosanoid biosynthesis during stress responses. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The warm periods of fluctuating thermal regimes (FTRs) provide opportunities for repair leading to increased survival, but there are also indications of negative effects of warm exposure. In this study, we examined respiration and oxidative stress in adult Alphitobius diaperinus exposed to FTRs and to constant low temperatures. We hypothesized that cold exposure will cause oxidative stress and that FTRs would reduce the amount of chill injuries, via activation of the antioxidant system. We measured (V) over dotCO(2), activities of super oxide dismutase (SOD), amounts of total (GSHt) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) during cold and warm periods of FTRs. Increased severity of cold exposure caused a decrease in the glutathione pool. SOD levels increased during the recovery period in the more severe FTR. The antioxidant response was sufficient to counter the reactive oxygen species production, as the GSH:GSSG ratio increased. We conclude that cold stress causes oxidative damage in these beetles, and that a warm recovery period activates the antioxidant system allowing repair of cold-induced damage, leading to the increased survival previously noted in beetles exposed to fluctuating versus constant temperatures.

However, the underlying mechanism of this temperature decrease is largely unknown. We have previously shown that Drosophila exhibit a daily temperature preference rhythm (TPR), in which their preferred temperatures increase during the daytime and then decrease at the transition from day to night (night-onset) (Kaneko et al., 2012). Because Drosophila are small ectotherms, their body temperature is very close to that of the ambient temperature (Stevenson, 1985), suggesting that their TPR generates their body temperature rhythm. Here, we demonstrate that the neuropeptide diuretic horm one 31 (DH31) and pigment-dispersing factor receptor (PDFR) contribute to regulate the preferred temperature decrease at night-onset. We show that PDFR and tethered-DH31 expression in dorsal neurons 2 (DN2s) restore the preferred temperature decrease at night-onset, suggesting that DH31 acts on PDFR in DN2s. Notably, we previously showed that the molecular clock in DN2s is important for TPR. Although PDF (another ligand of PDFR) is a critical factor for locomotor activity rhythms, Pdf mutants exhibit normal preferred temperature decreases at night-onset. This suggests that DH31-PDFR signaling specifically regulates a preferred temperature decrease at night-onset. Thus, we propose that night-onset TPR and locomotor activity rhythms are differentially controlled not only by clock neurons but also by neuropeptide signaling in the brain.","[Goda, Tadahiro; Tang, Xin; Umezaki, Yujiro; Chu, Michelle L.; Hamada, Fumika N.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, Abrahamson Pediat Eye Inst, Visual Syst Grp, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Hamada, Fumika N.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Hamada, Fumika N.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Hamada, Fumika N.] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA","Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati","Hamada, FN (corresponding author), Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, Abrahamson Pediat Eye Inst, Visual Syst Grp, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.","fumika.hamada@cchmc.org","","Chu, Michelle/0000-0003-0331-6118","Cincinnati Children's Hospital; Japan Science and Technology (JST)/Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO); March of Dimes; National Institutes of Health R01 Grant [GM107582]; NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES [UL1TR001425] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R01GM107582] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE [R01NS091070] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Cincinnati Children's Hospital; Japan Science and Technology (JST)/Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO); March of Dimes(March of Dimes); National Institutes of Health R01 Grant(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))","This work was supported by a Trustee Grant and Research Innovation/ Pilot funding from Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Charlotte R.

One influential hypothesis explaining this observation is that the challenge of obtaining sufficient oxygen to support metabolism becomes greater with increasing body size, and more so at high temperatures. Yet, previous models based on this hypothesis do not account for phenotypic plasticity in the physiology of organisms that counteracts oxygen limitation at high temperature. Here, we model the predicted strength of the temperature-size response using estimates of how both the oxygen supply and demand is affected by temperature when allowing for phenotypic plasticity in the aquatic ectotherm Daphnia magna. Our predictions remain highly inconsistent with empirical temperature-size responses, with the prior being close to one order of magnitude stronger than the latter. These results fail to provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that oxygen limitation drives temperature-size clines in aquatic ectotherms. Future studies into the role of oxygen limitation should address how the strength of the temperature-size response may be shaped by evolution under fluctuating temperature regimes. Finally, our results caution against applying deterministic models based on the oxygen limitation hypothesis when predicting future changes in ectotherm size distributions under climate change.","[Einum, Sigurd; Kielland, Oystein Nordeide] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Hogskoleringen 5, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Bech, Claus] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Hogskoleringen 5, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Kielland, Oystein Nordeide] Norwegian Vet Inst, PB 4024, N-7457 Trondheim, Norway","Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian Veterinary Institute","Einum, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Biol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Hogskoleringen 5, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.","sigurd.einum@ntnu.no","Bech, Claus/C-1086-2011","Bech, Claus/0000-0002-0860-0663","Research Council of Norway's (RCN) [230482, 223257/F50]; Norwegian University of Science and Technology","Research Council of Norway's (RCN)(Research Council of Norway); Norwegian University of Science and Technology","The study was funded through the Research Council of Norway's (RCN) Project Numbers 230482 and 223257/F50, and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

Ectotherms that have evolved in these conditions are therefore expected to exhibit narrow thermal optima and be very sensitive to the greater thermal variability (>6 degrees C) experienced at higher latitudes (>= 10 degrees N/S). The impact of increased thermal variability on the fitness and distribution of thermally sensitive reef ectotherms is currently unknown. Here, we examine site-attached planktivorous coral reef damselfishes that rely on their physiological capacity to swim and forage in the water column year round. We focus on 10 species spanning four evolutionarily distinct genera from a region of the Great Barrier Reef that experiences >= 6 degrees C difference between seasons. Four ecologically important indicators showed reduced performance during the winter low (23 degrees C) compared with the summer peak (29 degrees C), with effect sizes varying among species and genera, as follows: (i) the energy available for activity (aerobic scope) was reduced by 35-45% in five species and three genera; (ii) the energetically most efficient swimming speed was reduced by 17% across all species; and (iii) the maximal critical swimming speed and (iv) the gait transition speed (the swimming mode predominantly used for foraging) were reduced by 16-42% in six species spanning all four genera. Comparisons with field surveys within and across latitudes showed that species-specific distributions were strongly correlated with these performance indicators. Species occupy habitats where they can swim faster than prevailing habitat currents year round, and >95% of individuals were observed only in habitats where the gait transition speed can be maintained at or above habitat currents. Thermal fluctuation at higher latitudes appears to reduce performance as well as the possible distribution of species and genera within and among coral reef habitats. Ultimately, thermal variability across latitudes may progressively cause sublethal changes to species performance and lead to a contraction of biogeographical range.","[Johansen, Jacob L.] Univ Florida, Whitney Lab Marine Biosci, St Augustine, FL 32080 USA; [Johansen, Jacob L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Johansen, Jacob L.; Jones, Geoffrey P.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Steffensen, John F.] Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Sect, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark","State University System of Florida; University of Florida; James Cook University; James Cook University; University of Copenhagen","Johansen, JL (corresponding author), Univ Texas Richardson, Inst Marine Sci, Dept Marine Sci, 750 Channel View Dr, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.","jacob.johansen@my.jcu.edu.au","Steffensen, John F/F-6778-2010; Jones, Geoffrey P./E-9306-2010","Steffensen, John F/0000-0002-4477-8039; Jones, Geoffrey P./0000-0002-6244-1245","Lizard Island Doctoral Research Fellowship; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook University; Danish Research Council","Lizard Island Doctoral Research Fellowship; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook University(Australian Research Council); Danish Research Council(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","This study was funded by the Lizard Island Doctoral Research Fellowship to J.L.J., the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook University, to G.P.J. and the Danish Research Council to J.F.S.",NA,"62","14","14","2","28","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2051-1434","","","CONSERV PHYSIOL","Conserv.

Data sets for up to 22 mo were obtained, showing fluctuations in water temperature over the seasons. Nocturnal dive behaviour of the turtles at their foraging grounds revealed an increase in dive duration with decreasing water temperatures in winter.

While we know a great deal about how different constant temperatures impact the phenotypes of developing ectotherms, we know remarkably little about the impacts of temperature fluctuations on the development of ectotherms. In this study, we used a meta-analytic approach to compare the mean and variance of phenotypic outcomes from constant and fluctuating incubation temperatures across reptile species. We found that fluctuating temperatures provided a small benefit (higher hatching success and shorter incubation durations) at cool mean temperatures compared with constant temperatures, but had a negative effect at warm mean temperatures. In addition, more extreme temperature fluctuations led to greater reductions in embryonic survival compared with moderate temperature fluctuations. Within the limited data available from species with temperature-dependent sex determination, embryos had a higher chance of developing as female when developing in fluctuating temperatures compared with those developing in constant temperatures. With our meta-analytic approach, we identified average mean nest temperatures across all taxa where reptiles switch from receiving benefits to incurring costs when incubation temperatures fluctuate. More broadly, our study indicates that the impact of fluctuating developmental temperature on some phenotypes in ectothermic taxa are likely to be predictable via integration of developmental temperature profiles with thermal performance curves.","[Raynal, Rebecca S.; Schwanz, Lisa E.] UNSW Sydney, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Noble, Daniel W.

Moreover, thermal stress can influence species interactions across trophic levels, especially if members of different trophic levels show differential responses. In agricultural systems, parasitoids are frequently used as biocontrol agents to reduce crop damage by regulating populations of insect herbivores, but climate change can potentially threaten this ecosystem service. In this study, we investigated the effects of diurnally fluctuating temperature regimes (average treatment temperatures = 23 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 27 degrees C) on the relationship between the common agricultural pest Plutella xylostella and its larval parasitoid Diadegma insulare. We found that at higher temperatures, both the host and the parasitoid developed faster. Host survival was not influenced by tempera-ture, but higher temperatures resulted in increased parasitoid mortality in the pupal stage. Realized parasitism rates were also significantly decreased at higher temperatures, suggesting that D. insulare may become a less efficient biocontrol agent of P. xylostella as temperatures continue to increase.","[Spahn, Ryan; Lill, John T.] George Washington Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 800 22nd St NW,Suite 6000, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Spahn, Ryan] Dept Biol Sci, 800 22nd St NW,Suite 6000, Washington, DC 20052 USA","George Washington University","Spahn, R (corresponding author), Dept Biol Sci, 800 22nd St NW,Suite 6000, Washington, DC 20052 USA.","rspahn@gwu.edu","","Spahn, Ryan/0000-0001-8879-6274","Lepidopterists' Society (Ron Leuschner Memorial Fund); Washington Biologists' Field Club; Harlan Trust","Lepidopterists' Society (Ron Leuschner Memorial Fund); Washington Biologists' Field Club; Harlan Trust","This work was supported by research grants from the Lepidopterists' Society (Ron Leuschner Memorial Fund), The Washington Biologists' Field Club, and RS received financial support while conducting this research from the Harlan Trust.",NA,"48","0","0","1","1","ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE","SAN DIEGO","525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA","1049-9644","1090-2112","","BIOL CONTROL","Biol.

Summer heatwaves are predicted to increase in frequency and duration in the future, and could produce higher temperatures inside lizard nests. Increase in nest temperatures may influence offspring sex, body size, growth and locomotor performance, which in turn can affect fitness. We investigated whether incubation temperatures influenced the locomotor performance of hatchlings of the velvet gecko (Amalosia lesueurii), a nocturnal gecko that lays eggs in communal nests inside rock crevices. We incubated eggs at two fluctuating temperature regimes that mimicked current nest temperatures (mean=23.2 degrees C, range 10-33 degrees C, current') and predicted future nest temperatures (mean=27.0 degrees C, 14-37 degrees C, future'). We measured the locomotor performance of hatchlings at four temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C), and released them at two field sites (Nowra and Dharawal National Park, DNP') to estimate their growth and survival over 10months. Hot-incubated hatchlings were smaller, and ran more slowly than current-incubated hatchlings at all four test temperatures. Incubation temperature did not affect the growth rates of lizards from Nowra, but at DNP, hot-incubated lizards grew more slowly than current-incubated lizards. Survival analyses revealed that future-incubated hatchlings had lower survival than current-incubation hatchlings over 10months of life, but selection on hatchling traits differed between study sites. For hatchlings from DNP, there was evidence for directional selection on body mass, but little support for selection on SVL or speed. At Nowra, there was equivalent evidence for selection on mass, SVL and speed. These results demonstrate that incubation induced differences in morphology and locomotor performance can influence the survival of hatchlings. In the absence of maternal plasticity in nesting behavior, future increase in nest temperatures, by altering offspring morphology, performance and survival, have the potential to influence the viability of gecko populations.","[Dayananda, B.; Penfold, S.; Webb, J.

Whereas mammals use internal energy to regulate body temperature, ectotherms typically regulate body temperature behaviorally [1]. Some ectotherms maintain homeostasis via a daily temperature preference rhythm (TPR) [2], but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila exhibit a daily circadian clock-dependent TPR that resembles mammalian BTR. Pacemaker neurons critical for locomotor activity are not necessary for TPR; instead, the dorsal neuron 2 s (DN2s), whose function was previously unknown, is sufficient. This indicates that TPR, like BTR, is controlled independently from locomotor activity. Therefore, the mechanisms controlling temperature fluctuations in fly TPR and mammalian BTR may share parallel features. Taken together, our results reveal the existence of a novel DN2-based circadian neural circuit that specifically regulates TPR; thus, understanding the mechanisms of TPR will shed new light on the function and neural control of circathan rhythms.","[Kaneko, Haruna; Head, Lauren M.; Tang, Xin; Hamada, Fumika N.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Visual Syst Grp, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Ling, Jinli; Emery, Patrick] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Dept Neurobiol, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Ling, Jinli; Emery, Patrick] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Med, Program Neurosci, Worcester, MA 01605 USA; [Liu, Yilin; Hardin, Paul E.] Texas A&M Univ, Ctr Biol Clocks Res, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Liu, Yilin; Hardin, Paul E.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol, College Stn, TX 77845 USA; [Hamada, Fumika N.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Worcester; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)","Hamada, FN (corresponding author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Visual Syst Grp, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, 3333 Burnet Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.","fumika.hamada@cchmc.org","","Hardin, Paul/0000-0002-3370-9011","Cincinnati Children's Hospital; JST/PRESTO; March of Dimes; National Institutes of Health [GM079182, NS052854]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R01GM079182] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE [R01NS052854] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Cincinnati Children's Hospital; JST/PRESTO(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); March of Dimes(March of Dimes); National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS))","We are grateful to Paul Taghert for the per<SUP>01</SUP>, tim<SUP>01</SUP>, and cry-Gale flies, Michael Rosbash for the anti-PDF and anti-PER, and Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center.

Although climate models predict increases in both temperature mean and variance, such tolerances are typically assessed under constant conditions. We tested the effects of temperature variability during development on male fitness in the rainforest fly Drosophila birchii, by simulating thermal variation typical of the warm and cool margins of its elevational distribution, and estimated heritabilities and genetic correlations of fitness traits. Reproductive success was reduced for males reared in warm (mean 24 degrees C) fluctuating (+/- 3 degrees C) vs. constant conditions but not in cool fluctuating conditions (mean 17 degrees C), although fluctuations reduced body size at both temperatures. Male reproductive success under warm fluctuating conditions was similar to that at constant 27 degrees C, indicating that briefly exceeding critical thermal limits has similar fitness costs to continuously stressful conditions. There was substantial heritable variation in all traits. However, reproductive success traits showed no genetic correlation between treatments reflecting temperature variation at elevational extremes, which may constrain evolutionary responses at these ecological margins. Our data suggest that even small increases in temperature variability will threaten tropical ectotherms living close to their upper thermal limits, both through direct effects on fitness and by limiting their adaptive potential.","[Saxon, A.

Many ectothermic reptiles are active over a range of body temperatures that vary seasonally. Here we test the hypothesis that metabolic enzyme activity acclimatises seasonally in freshwater turtles (Chelodina longicollis) in addition to, or instead of, behavioural regulation of body temperatures. We measured body temperatures in free-ranging turtles (n=3) by radiotelemetry, and we assayed phosphofructokinase (PFK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activities in early autumn (March, n=10 turtles), late autumn (May, n=7) and mid-winter (July, n=7) over a range of assay temperatures (10 degreesC, 15 degreesC, 20 degreesC, 25 degreesC). Body temperatures were either not different from, or higher than expected from a theoretical null-distribution of a randomly moving animal. Field body temperatures at any season were lower, however, than expected from animals that maximised their sun exposure. Turtles maintained constant PFK, LDH and CCO activities in different months, despite body temperature differences of nearly 13.0 degreesC between March (average daily body temperature=24.4 degreesC) and July (average=11.4 degreesC). CS activity did not vary between March and May (average daily body temperature=20.2 degreesC), but it decreased in July. Thus C. longicollis use a combination of behavioural thermoregulation and biochemical acclimatisation in response to seasonally changing thermal conditions. Ectothermic reptiles were often thought not to acclimatise biochemically, and our results show that behavioural attainment of a preferred body temperature is not mandatory for activity or physiological performance in turtles.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","University of Sydney","Seebacher, F (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.","fseebach@bio.usyd.edu.au","Thompson, Mike/ABA-8716-2020","Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311; Thompson, Michael/0000-0002-2496-992X","","","",NA,"39","26","26","0","25","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0174-1578","1432-136X","","J COMP PHYSIOL B","J.

On our study site, substrate temperature is frequently greater than L. saxatilis upper physiological thermal limits, especially on sun exposed microhabitats. To maintain body temperatures within their thermal tolerance window, withdrawn snails adopted a flat posture, or elevated their shells and kept appended to the rock on the outer lip of their aperture with dried mucous (standing posture). These thermal regulatory behaviours lowered snail body temperatures on average by 1-2 degrees C. Aggregation behaviour had no thermoregulatory effect on L. saxatilis in the present study. The occupation of biogenic microhabitats (barnacles) was associated with a 1 degrees C decrease in body temperatures.

This review analyzes the respiratory response of marine animal ectotherms to fluctuating environmental O-2 availability in their specific habitats and reactive O-2 species generation under environmental stress, with a special emphasis on temperature. Specifically we compare mitochondrial functioning and reactive O-2 species formation in these animals to what is known from endothermal, mammalian species. Among the strategies employed by marine invertebrates to maintain tissue PO2 low and within tolerable margins, the possible role of mitochondrial oxyconformity to control cellular PO2 in water breathers is discussed. Mitochondrial generation of reactive O-2 species in ectotherms has been shown to depend on the magnitude of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the mitochondrial H+ leak. Alternative mitochondrial oxidases are described in marine ectotherms and might add to ameliorate reactive O-2 species formation. The effect of nitric oxide, which in mammals controls the reduction state of the electron transport by lowering cytochrome oxidase O-2 affinity, remains to be investigated in marine invertebrates. A new concept is proposed, showing how the cross talk of reactive O-2 species in metabolically low marine invertebrates could support their outstanding hypoxia tolerance under non-stressed conditions.","Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Sch Pharm & Biochem, Phys Chem PRALIB, RA-1113 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Dept Marine Anim Physiol & Funct, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany","University of Buenos Aires; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Puntarulo, S (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Farm & Bioquim, Sch Pharm & Biochem, Phys Chem PRALIB, Junin 956, RA-1113 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.","susanap@ffyb.uba.ar","","Abele, Doris/0000-0002-5766-5017","","","",NA,"120","108","112","2","52","BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH INST-BRI","SINGAPORE","7 TEMZASEK BLVD, SUNTEC TOWER ONE, SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE","2768-6701","2768-6698","","FRONT BIOSCI-LANDMRK","Front.

However, risk assessments often focus on changes in mean temperatures and thus ignore the role of temporal variability or structure. Using Earth System Model projections, we show that significant regional differences in the statistical distribution of temperature will emerge over time and give rise to shifts in the mean, variability and persistence of thermal stress. Integrating these trends into mathematical models that simulate the dynamical and cumulative effects of thermal stress on the performance of 38 globally distributed ectotherm species revealed complex regional changes in population stability over the twenty-first century, with temperate species facing higher risk. Yet despite their idiosyncratic effects on stability, projected temperatures universally increased extinction risk. Overall, these results show that the effects of climate change may be more extensive than previously predicted on the basis of the statistical relationship between biological performance and average temperature. The authors project changes in mean thermal stress, as well as its persistence and variability. They show complex impacts on species stability but universal increases in extinction risk, and highlight the need to go beyond average-temperature-based projections of biological performance.","[Duffy, Kate; Ganguly, Auroop R.] Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Sustainabil & Data Sci Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Duffy, Kate] NASA Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Duffy, Kate] Bay Area Environm Res Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Gouhier, Tarik C.] Northeastern Univ, Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA USA; [Ganguly, Auroop R.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA USA","Northeastern University; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Ames Research Center; Northeastern University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Duffy, K (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Sustainabil & Data Sci Lab, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;Duffy, K (corresponding author), NASA Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.;Duffy, K (corresponding author), Bay Area Environm Res Inst, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.","duffy.m.kate@gmail.com","","Duffy, Kate/0000-0002-6506-5978","National Science Foundation (NSF) [CCF-1442728]; NSF [SES-1735505, OCE-2048894]; NSF Expeditions in Computing grant [1029711]; DOD Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program [RC20-1183]; NASA Ames Research Center","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF Expeditions in Computing grant(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); DOD Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program; NASA Ames Research Center(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","This work was primarily supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) grant CCF-1442728 while K.D. was a PhD student at the SDS Lab in Northeastern University.

Heart rates were non-invasively determined in juvenile crabs for three temperature regimes, each over an 8-day session; A: temperature exposures of 26 degrees C (2 days) to 30 degrees C (3 days) to 26 degrees C (3 days), B: 26 degrees C (2 days) to 32 degrees C (3 days) to 26 degrees C (3 days) and C: a control at constant 26 degrees C. I kart rate variations were significant among the regimes (P < 0.05), with the median heart rate being highest for regime B (74 beats per minute or bpm) during the temperature insult (32 degrees C), relative to regime A (70 bpm) and the control (64 bpm). Notably, a suppression and inversion of the diurnal cardiac patterns occurred for regimes' A and B crabs respectively, with rates from the highest temperature insult not shifting back to pre-insult levels during recovery (26 degrees C). It is plausible that P. dentata may have compensatory cardiovascular mechanisms that account for these differential heart rate responses, possibly conveying adaptive strategies in its dynamic habitat conditions.","[Singh, D.

However, another but poorly studied main effect of global change appears to be an increase in temperature variability. Most of the current analyses of global change have focused on mean values, paying less attention to the role of the fluctuations of environmental variables. We tested the effects of daily thermal amplitude with constant mean (24-24 degrees C, 27-21 degrees C and 32-16 degrees C) on different performance traits (rollover speed, body mass balance and survival) in populations of woodlouse (Porcellio laevis) from two altitudes. We observed that maximum performance showed a significant effect of population in the first but not in the fifth week, and only the population effect was significant for optimum temperature. Interestingly, populations under higher amplitude in environmental temperature exhibited higher resistance to a fluctuating climatic regime. We suggest that our results indicate that thermal variability may produce important effects on biodiversity. Therefore, in order to develop more realistic scenarios of global climate change effects on biodiversity, the effects of thermal variability as well as mean need to be examined simultaneously.

Constant normoxia, or 100% oxygen saturation, is therefore rare. Since the thermal sensitivity of invertebrates is directly linked to oxygen availability, we hypothesized that (i) the metabolic response of coastal marine invertebrates would be more sensitive to thermal stress when exposed to oxygen supersaturation rather than 100% oxygen saturation and (ii) natural diel fluctuation in oxygen availability rather than constant 100% oxygen saturation is a main driver of the thermal response. We tested the effects of oxygen regime on the metabolic rate, and haemocyanin and lactate levels, of velvet crabs (Necora puber) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), under rising temperatures (up to 24 degrees C) in the laboratory. Oxygen supersaturation and photosynthetically induced diel oxygen fluctuation amplified animal metabolic thermal response significantly in both species, demonstrating that the natural variability of oxygen in coastal environments can provide considerable physiological benefits under ocean warming. Our study highlights the significance of integrating ecologically relevant oxygen variability into experimental assessments of animal physiology and thermal response, and predictions of metabolic performance under climate warming. Given the escalating intensity and frequency of climate anomalies, oxygen variation caused by coastal vegetation will likely become increasingly important in mitigating the effects of higher temperatures on coastal fauna.","[Booth, J.

Many ectotherms are capable of active thermoregulation, e.g. by selecting suitable microhabitats. However, this may be constrained by unavailability of favourable microhabitats or high energetic costs of theimoregulation. Thus, to achieve the optimal performance levels, adaptations to local thermal environments are of great importance. Due to the inability of leaving their aquatic habitat, larval anurans should especially benefit from local thermal adaptations. Rana temporaria is a widely distributed European anuran species, inhabiting a range of microhabitats, which makes it an excellent model to study the potential of local thermal adaptation. We raised R. temporaria tadpoles from Germany and Croatia under respective natural temperature fluctuations and three constant temperatures (15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees C), and tested dependency of their thermal preferences on the developmental stage and temperature regime, and the population origin. Tadpoles of both origins selected higher temperatures towards the end of the developmental period, and their thermal preferences were affected by the developmental temperature. However, regardless of the developmental stage or treatment, tadpoles from warmer Croatia selected higher temperatures than tadpoles from colder Germany. This demonstrates the tendency of adjusting the sensitivity of physiological processes to local thermal conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Energy metabolism of ectothermic organisms is directly affected by environmental temperature changes and has been demonstrated to affect brain energy balance in fish. Fish were hypothesized to metabolize lactate as an additional energy substrate during acute exposure to energy demanding environmental abiotic fluctuations to support brain functionality. However, to date the pathways of lactate mobilization and transport in the fish brain are not well understood, and may represent a critical physiological feature in ectotherms during acclimation to low temperature. Results: We found depressed routine metabolic rates in zebrafish during acute exposure to hypothermic (18 degrees C) conditions accompanied by decreased lactate concentrations in brain tissues. No changes in brain glucose content were observed. Acute cold stress increased protein concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase 1 (LDH1) and citrate synthase (CS) in brain by 1.8- and- 2.5-fold, paralleled by an increased pyruvate to acetyl-CoA transformation. To test the involvement of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) under acute cold stress in zebrafish, we cloned and sequenced seven MCT1-4 homologues in zebrafish. All drMCT1-4 are expressed in brain tissues and in response to cold stress drmct2a and drmct4a transcripts were up-regulated 5-and 3-fold, respectively. On the contrary, mRNA levels of drmct1a, -1b and -4b in zebrafish brain responded with a down regulation in response to cold stress. By expressing drMCTs in Xenopus oocytes we could provide functional evidence that hypothermic stress leads to a 2-fold increase in lactate transport in drMCT4b expressing oocytes. Lactate transport of other paralogues expressed in oocytes was unaffected, or even decreased during cold stress. Conclusion: The present work provides evidence that lactate utilization and transport pathways represent an important energy homeostatic feature to maintain vital functions of brain cells during acute cold stress in ectotherms.","[Tseng, Yung-Che; Liu, Sian-Tai] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Life Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Hu, Marian Y.; Chen, Ruo-Dong; Lee, Jay-Ron; Hwang, Pung-Pung] Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Taipei 115, Taiwan","National Taiwan Normal University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan","Hwang, PP (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Cellular & Organism Biol, Taipei 115, Taiwan.","pphwang@gate.sinica.edu.tw","Tseng, Yung-Che/AAE-7509-2022; Hwang, Pung-Pung/AAH-1538-2022; Hwang, Pung-Pung/AEQ-4633-2022","Tseng, Yung-Che/0000-0001-7489-0403; ","National Science Council, Taiwan, Republic of China [NSC 102-2321-B-003-002]; Alexander von Humbold/National Science Council (Taiwan) [NSC 102-2911-I-001-002-2]","National Science Council, Taiwan, Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Alexander von Humbold/National Science Council (Taiwan)","This study was financially supported by the grants to Y.

Many ectotherms use behavior to control T-b within narrow levels. These temperatures are assumed to be optimal and therefore to match body temperatures (T-rmax) that maximize fitness (r). We develop an optimality model and find that optimal body temperature (T-o) should not be centered T-rmax at but shifted to a lower temperature. This finding seems paradoxical but results from two considerations relating to Jensen's inequality, which deals with how variance and skew influence integrals of nonlinear functions. First, ectotherms are not perfect thermoregulators and so experience a range of T-b. Second, temperature-fitness curves are asymmetric, such that a T-b higher than T-rmax depresses fitness more than will a T-b displaced an equivalent amount below T-rmax . Our model makes several predictions. The magnitude of the optimal shift (T-rmax-T-o) should increase with the degree of asymmetry of temperature-fitness curves and with T-b variance. Deviations should be relatively large for thermal specialists but insensitive to whether fitness increases with T-rmax (hotter is better). Asymmetric (left-skewed) T-b distributions reduce the magnitude of the optimal shift but do not eliminate it. Comparative data (insects, lizards) support key predictions. Thus, suboptimal is optimal.","[Huey, Raymond B.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Martin, Tara Laine] Harvey Mudd Coll, Dept Biol, Claremont, CA 91711 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Claremont Colleges; Harvey Mudd College","Huey, RB (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Box 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","hueyrb@u.washington.edu","Huey, Raymond/F-1597-2010","","","","",NA,"133","428","429","1","147","UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","CHICAGO","1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","0003-0147","","","AM NAT","Am.

In thermally extreme environments, it is challenging for organisms to maximize performance due to risks associated with stochastic variation in temperature and, subsequently, over evolutionary time minimizing the exposure to risk can serve as one of the mechanisms that result in organisms preferring suboptimal temperatures. 2. We tested this hypothesis in a slow-moving intertidal snail on tropical rocky shores, where temperature variability increases with time from 30 min to 20 hr when recorded at 30 min intervals (due to short-term environmental autocorrelation where temperatures closer in time are more similar as compared to temperatures over a long period of time). Failure to accommodate temporal variation in thermal stress by selecting cool habitats can result in mortality. 3. Thermal performance curves for different traits (heart rate and locomotion) were measured and compared to the snail's thermal preferences in both the field and laboratory. Predicted performances of the snails were simulated based on thermal performance curves for different traits over multiple time-scales and simulated carryover effects. 4. A strong mismatch was found between physiological and behavioural thermal maxima of the snails (physiological thermal maximum being higher by similar to 7 degrees C), but the snails avoided these maxima and sought temperatures 7-14 degrees C cooler. Such a risk-averse strategy can be explained by their predicted performances where the snails should make decisions about preferred temperatures based on time periods >= 5 hr to avoid underestimating the temporal variation in body temperature. 5. In extreme and stochastic environments, where the temporal variation in environmental conditions can lead to substantial divergence between instantaneous and time-averaged thermal performances, 'cooler is better' and 'suboptimal' body temperatures are preferred as they provide sufficient buffer to reduce mortality risk from heat stress.","[Hui, T.

Phenotypic plasticity was initially thought to be beneficial to an organism's physiological fitness but several alternative hypotheses have been proposed with growing empirical support. In this study, we tested the full suite of hypotheses by investigating acclimation responses of locomotor performance for nine populations of five species of sub-Antarctic weevils, using static and fluctuating temperatures. Species showed typical locomotion thermal performance curves with temperature of the maximum speed (T-opt) ranging between 22.3 +/- 1.7 degrees C (mean +/- s.e.m.) and 31.1 +/- 0.7 degrees C. For most species, T-opt was not affected by acclimation. For maximum speed (U-max), significant, positive effects of acclimation were found for all species except a supralittoral one. Individuals acclimated to 0 degrees C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation treatments (15 degrees C and fluctuating 0-15 degrees C). Performance breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, T-br) typically showed little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral species was affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and fluctuating temperature treatments were similar. Our findings also revealed that the mean estimated activation energy 0.40 +/- 0.015 eV (mean +/- s.e.m.) was lower than for other herbivores, the category to which these weevils belong, suggesting that some form of compensation in the rate-temperature relationship may be evident. Thus, we typically found support for the 'warmer is better' hypothesis for acclimation of locomotor performance, although some compensation was evident.","[Treasure, Anne M.] Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa; [Chown, Steven L.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Treasure, Anne M.] South African Environm Observat Network, Cape Town, South Africa","Stellenbosch University; Monash University; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON)","Treasure, AM (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Ctr Invas Biol, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.;Treasure, AM (corresponding author), South African Environm Observat Network, Cape Town, South Africa.","anne.m.treasure@gmail.com","Chown, Steven/ABD-7646-2021; Chown, Steven/H-3347-2011","Chown, Steven/0000-0001-6069-5105; Treasure, Anne/0000-0002-8345-4811","National Research Foundation of South Africa","National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa)","The South African National Antarctic Programme provided logistic support and the work was funded by the National Research Foundation of South Africa.",NA,"86","2","2","0","8","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

Most of these studies are conducted on endotherms, especially mammals, which maintain constant body temperature in the face of environmental temperature variability. However, the majority of animals and vertebrates are ectotherms, which often experience fluctuations in body temperature as a result of their environment. While there have been several studies investigating the gut microbial diversity of ectotherms, we lack an understanding of how environmental temperature affects these communities. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to inventory the gut microbial communities of tadpoles exposed to cool (18 degrees C) or warm (28 degrees C) temperature treatments. We found that temperature significantly impacted the community structure and membership of the tadpole gut. Specifically, tadpoles in the warm treatment exhibited higher abundances of the phylum Planctomycetes and the genus Mycobacterium. These results may be due to the direct effects of temperature, or mediated through changes in host physiology. Given that environmental temperatures are expected to increase due to global climate change, understanding the effects of temperature on the diversity and function of gut microbial communities is critical.","[Kohl, Kevin D.] Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA; [Yahn, Jeremiah] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Vanderbilt University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison","Kohl, KD (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Nashville, TN 37232 USA.","kevin.d.kohl@gmail.com","","Kohl, Kevin/0000-0003-1126-2949","University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute [NA16RG2257, R/EH-2]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; U.S. Department of Commerce [NA10OAR4170070, R/HCE-14]; National Science Foundation [DEB 1210094, DBI 1400456]; Direct For Biological Sciences [1400456] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","University of Wisconsin Sea Grant Institute; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); U.S. Department of Commerce; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","We would like to thank Cherry Tsai-Brown and Logan Laatsch for assistance with animal husbandry and dissections.

Bet-hedging is generally associated with parental effects, but phenotypic variation may also develop throughout life via developmental instability (DI). This opens for the possibility of a within-generation mechanism creating DBH during the lifetime of individuals. If so, DI could in fact be a plastic trait itself; if a fluctuating environment indicates uncertainty about future conditions, sensing such fluctuations could trigger DI as a DBH response. However, this possibility has received little empirical attention. Here, we test whether fluctuating environments may elicit such a response in the clonally reproducing crustacean Daphnia magna. Specifically, we exposed genetically identical individuals to two environments of different thermal stability (stable vs. pronounced daily realistic temperature fluctuations) and tested for effects on DI in body mass and metabolic rate shortly before maturation. Furthermore, we also estimated the genetic variation in DI. Interestingly, fluctuating temperatures did not affect body mass, but metabolic rate decreased. We found no evidence for plasticity in DI in response to environmental fluctuations. The lack of plasticity was common to all genotypes, and for both traits studied. However, we found considerable evolvability for DI, which implies a general evolutionary potential for DBH under selection for increased phenotypic variance.","[Kielland, Oystein Nordeide; Einum, Sigurd] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, NTNU, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Trondheim, Norway; [Bech, Claus] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway","Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)","Einum, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, NTNU, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Trondheim, Norway.","sigurd.einum@ntnu.no","Kielland, Øystein Nordeide/X-7451-2019; Bech, Claus/N-1077-2019; Bech, Claus/C-1086-2011","Kielland, Øystein Nordeide/0000-0002-1387-1724; Bech, Claus/0000-0002-0860-0663; Bech, Claus/0000-0002-0860-0663; Einum, Sigurd/0000-0002-3788-7800","Norges Forskningsrad [223257/F50, 230482]","Norges Forskningsrad","Norges Forskningsrad, Grant/Award Number: 223257/F50 and 230482",NA,"67","7","7","0","16","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Lately, there has been interest in using the intrinsic growth rate (rm) to predict the effects of climate warming on ectotherm population viability. However, because rm is calculated using the Euler-Lotka equation, its reliability in predicting population persistence depends on whether ectotherm populations can achieve a stable age/stage distribution in thermally variable environments. Here, we investigate this issue using a mathematical framework that incorporates mechanistic descriptions of temperature effects on vital rates into a stage-structured population model that realistically captures the temperature-induced variability in developmental delays that characterize ectotherm life cycles. We find that populations experiencing seasonal temperature variation converge to a stage distribution whose intra-annual pattern remains invariant across years. As a result, the mean annual per capita growth rate also remains constant between years. The key insight is the mechanism that allows populations converge to a stationary stage distribution. Temperature effects on the biochemical processes (e.g. enzyme kinetics, hormonal regulation) that underlie life-history traits (reproduction, development and mortality) exhibit well-defined thermodynamical properties (e.g. changes in entropy and enthalpy) that lead to predictable outcomes (e.g. reduction in reaction rates or hormonal action at temperature extremes). As a result, life-history traits exhibit a systematic and predictable response to seasonal temperature variation. This in turn leads to temporally predictable temperature responses of the stage distribution and the per capita growth rate. When climate warming causes an increase in the mean annual temperature and/or the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations, the population model predicts the mean annual per capita growth rate to decline to zero within 100 years when warming is slow relative to the developmental period of the organism (003-005 degrees C per year) and to become negative, causing population extinction, well before 100 years when warming is fast (e.g. 01 degrees C per year). The Euler-Lotka equation predicts a slower decrease in rm when warming is slow and a longer persistence time when warming is fast, with the deviation between the two metrics increasing with increasing developmental period. These results suggest that predictions of ectotherm population viability based on rm may be valid only for species with short developmental delays, and even then, only over short time-scales and under slow warming regimes.","[Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Coutinho, Renato M.] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Fis Teor, BR-01140070 Sao Paulo, Brazil","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Universidade Estadual Paulista","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","amarasek@ucla.edu","Coutinho, Renato M/H-9133-2017","Coutinho, Renato M/0000-0002-2828-8558","James S.

Abiotic variation can affect species directly through their life-history traits and indirectly by modulating the species' interactions with resources or natural enemies. We investigate how the interplay between density-dependent dynamics and abiotic variability affects population dynamics of the bordered plant bug (Largus californicus), a Hemipteran herbivore inhabiting the California coastal sage scrub community. Field data show a striking pattern in abundance: adults are extremely abundant or nearly absent during certain periods of the year, leading us to predict that seasonal forcing plays a role in driving observed dynamics. We develop a stage-structured population model with variable developmental delays, in which fecundity is affected by both intraspecific competition and temporal variation in resource availability and all life-history traits (reproduction, development, mortality) are temperature-dependent. We parameterize the model with experimental data on temperature responses of life-history and competitive traits and validate the model with independent field census data. We find that intraspecific competition is strongest at temperatures optimal for reproduction, which theory predicts leads to more complex population dynamics. Our model predicts that while temperature resource variability interacts with development-induced delays in self-limitation to generate population fluctuations, it is the interplay between all three factors that drive the observed dynamics. Considering how multiple abiotic factors interact with density-dependent processes is important both for understanding how species persist in variable environments and predicting species' responses to perturbations in their typical environment.","[Johnson, Christopher A.; Berlin, Erin; Dolphin, Kimberly E.; Heyer, Johanna; Kim, Britney; Leung, Alice; Sabellon, Jamie Lou; Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Johnson, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Coutinho, Renato M.] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Fis Teor, Rua Quirino de Andrade 215, BR-01049010 Sao Paulo, Brazil","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Arizona; Universidade Estadual Paulista","Johnson, CA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Johnson, CA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.","johnsonc@email.arizona.edu","Coutinho, Renato M/H-9133-2017","Coutinho, Renato M/0000-0002-2828-8558; Johnson, Christopher/0000-0001-6388-8770","Science Foundation Arizona Grant [BSP 0528-13]; NSF [DEB-0717350]; Complex Systems Scholar Grant from James S.

Average temperature is the more common climatic variable used in physiological and population studies, and its effect on individual and population-level processes is well understood. However, the intrinsic variability of thermal conditions calls attention to the potential effects that this variability could have in ecological systems. Regarding this point, two hypotheses are proposed. From the allocation principle, it may be inferred that if temperature variability is high enough to induce stress in the organisms, then this extra-cost should reduce the energetic budget for reproduction, which will be reflected in population parameters. Moreover, a mathematical property of non-linear functions, Jensen's inequality, indicates that, in concave functions, like the temperature-reproduction performance function, variability reduces the expected value of the output variable, and again modifies population parameters. To test these hypotheses, experimental cultures of Tribolium confusum under two different thermal variability regimens were carried out. With these data, we fitted a simple population dynamics model to evaluate the predictions of our hypothesis. The results show that thermal variability reduces the maximum reproductive rate of the population but no other parameters such as carrying capacity or the nonlinear factor in a nonlinear version of the Ricker model, which confirms our hypotheses. This result has important consequences, such as the paradoxical increase in population variability under a decrease in thermal variability and the necessary incorporation of climatic variability to evaluate the net effect of climate change on the dynamics of natural populations.","[Estay, Sergio A.; Clavijo-Baquet, Sabrina; Lima, Mauricio; Bozinovic, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","Estay, SA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Dept Ecol, Casilla 114-D, Santiago 6513677, Chile.","sestay@bio.puc.cl","Lima, Mauricio/F-2722-2013","Lima, Mauricio/0000-0002-3700-2945; Estay, Sergio/0000-0002-3797-8964; Clavijo-Baquet, Sabrina/0000-0002-9784-9144","FONDAP [1501-0001 CASEB]; CONICYT","FONDAP; CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT))","Funded by FONDAP 1501-0001 CASEB (Programs 1 and 2).

Tropical ectotherms, like many fishes, can be particularly susceptible to temperature change as they occupy environments with narrow thermal fluctuations. While climate change models predict temperatures to increase over decades, thermal fluctuations are already experienced on a seasonal scale, which may affect the ability to capture and defend resources across a thermal gradient. For coral reef fish, losers of competitive interactions are often more vulnerable to predation, and this pressure is strongest just after settlement. Competitive interactions may determine future success for coral reef fishes, and understanding how temperature experienced during settlement can influence such interactions will give insight to community dynamics in a future warmer world. We tested the effect of increased temperatures on intraspecific competitive interactions of two sympatric species of reef damselfish, the blue damselfish Pomacentrus nagasakiensis, and the whitetail damselfish Pomacentrus chrysurus. Juvenile fishes were exposed to one of four temperature treatments, ranging from 26-32 degrees C, for seven days then placed into competitive arenas where aggressive interactions were recorded between sized matched individuals within each species. While there was no apparent effect of temperature treatment on aggressive behaviour for P. chrysurus, we observed up to a four-fold increase in aggression scores for P. nagasakiensis with increasing temperature. Results suggest that temperature experienced as juveniles can impact aggressive behaviour; however, species-specific thermal tolerances led to behavioural affects that differ among closely related species. Differential thermal tolerance among species may cause restructuring of the interaction network that underlies the structure of reef assemblages.","[Warren, Donald T.; McCormick, Mark, I] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia","James Cook University","McCormick, MI (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia.","mark.mccormick@jcu.edu.au","","","Australian Research Council [DP120101993]; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies [EI140100117]","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies(Australian Research Council)","This project was funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery grant (DP120101993) and support from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (EI140100117).

Phenotypic plasticity (thermal acclimation) might mitigate adverse effects, however, we lack a fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms of thermal acclimation and how they are affected by fluctuating temperature. Here we investigated the effect of thermal acclimation in Drosophila melanogaster on critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and associated global gene expression profiles as induced by two constant and two ecologically relevant (non-stressful) diurnally fluctuating temperature regimes. Both mean and fluctuation of temperature contributed to thermal acclimation and affected the transcriptome. The transcriptomic response to mean temperatures comprised modification of a major part of the transcriptome, while the response to fluctuations affected a much smaller set of genes, which was highly independent of both the response to a change in mean temperature and to the classic heat shock response. Although the independent transcriptional effects caused by fluctuations were relatively small, they are likely to contribute to our understanding of thermal adaptation. We provide evidence that environmental sensing, particularly phototransduction, is a central mechanism underlying the regulation of thermal acclimation to fluctuating temperatures. Thus, genes and pathways involved in phototransduction are likely of importance in fluctuating climates.","[Sorensen, Jesper Givskov; Schou, Mads Fristrup; Loeschcke, Volker] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Genet Ecol & Evolut, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Kristensen, Torsten Nygaard] Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Fredrik Bajers Vej 7H, DK-9220 Aalborg E, Denmark","Aarhus University; Aalborg University","Sorensen, JG (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Sect Genet Ecol & Evolut, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.","jesper.soerensen@bios.au.dk","Schou, Mads Fristrup/J-2148-2014; Sørensen, Jesper Givskov/J-3190-2013; Loeschcke, Volker/J-2527-2013; Kristensen, Torsten N/C-5031-2015","Schou, Mads Fristrup/0000-0001-5521-5269; Sørensen, Jesper Givskov/0000-0002-9149-3626; Loeschcke, Volker/0000-0003-1450-0754; Kristensen, Torsten N/0000-0001-6204-8753","","","",NA,"64","37","37","2","41","NATURE RESEARCH","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","2045-2322","","","SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","AUG 4","2016","6","","",NA,"",NA,"","","30975","10.1038/srep30975","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep30975","","","11","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","DS6LV","27487917","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000380894200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Early life experiences can have lasting impacts on how individuals respond to environmental variation later in life (i.e., individual reaction norms), altering the capacity for populations to respond to selection. Here, we incubated lizard embryos (Lampropholis delicata) at two fluctuating developmental temperatures (cold= 23 degrees C +/ - 3 degrees C, hot( )= 29 degrees C + / - 3 degrees C , n(cold) = 26, n(hot) = 25) to understand how it affected metabolic plasticity to temperature later in life. We repeatedly measured individual reaction norms across six temperatures 10 times over - similar to 3.5 months (n(obs) = 3,818) to estimate the repeatability of average metabolic rate (intercept) and thermal plasticity (slope). The intercept and the slope of the population-level reaction norm was not affected by developmental temperature. Repeatability of average metabolic rate was, on average, 10% lower in hot incubated lizards but stable across all temperatures. The slope of the thermal reaction norm was overall moderately repeatable (R = 0.44, 95% CI= 0.035 - 0.93) suggesting that individual metabolic rate changed consistently with short-term changes in temperature, although credible intervals were quite broad. Importantly, reaction norm repeatability did not depend on early developmental temperature. Identifying factors affecting among-individual variation in thermal plasticity will be increasingly more important for terrestrial ectotherms living in changing climate. Our work implies that thermal metabolic plasticity is robust to early developmental temperatures and has the capacity to evolve, despite there being less consistent variation in metabolic rate under hot environments.","[Kar, Fonti; Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ New South Wales, Ecol & Evolut Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Noble, Daniel W.

In this study, we examined the importance of temperature fluctuation on the development of organisms by compiling published studies. Published studies have shown highly variable results where the developmental rate was sometimes higher and sometimes lower under static temperature compared with variable temperature. A laboratory experiment on Megaselia scalaris showed that M.scalaris developed faster under fluctuating temperature than static temperature. We tested an additive model to predict the effect of fluctuating temperature on development and found that the model was inadequate for making quantitative predictions. However, some qualitative predictions, for example temperature fluctuation has a positive or negative effect, can be successfully predicted by the additive model.

How thermal evolution may affect trophic interactions and its implications for trophic system stability remains unstudied. To advance insights in how global warming shapes trophic interactions, we need to consider besides increases in mean temperatures, also daily thermal fluctuations (DTF) and heat waves (HW), and how their effects are modulated by thermal evolution. 2. Using a common-garden approach, we tested how each thermal factor affected predator metabolic rate and functional response parameters, and used these responses to predict long-term predator-prey interaction strength between larvae of the damselfly Ischnura elegans and the water flea Daphnia magna. Using high- and low-latitude predator populations with the latter being exposed to higher mean temperatures, higher DTF and more frequent HW, we assessed the potential impact of thermal evolution at the high latitude using a space-for-time substitution. 3. In line with thermal adaptation, growth rates were faster and handling times shorter in low-latitude compared to high-latitude larvae at 24 degrees C while the opposite was true at 20 degrees C. Warming weakened the long-term interaction strength, except for the high-latitude trophic system at DTF and HW where plastic responses therefore may not stabilize the high-latitude system. This extends the emerging insight that temperature variation may make ectotherms more vulnerable to warming. The contributions of metabolic rate, search rate and handling time in shaping thermal effects on interaction strength differed between latitudes. A key finding was that thermal evolution may further weaken the long-term interaction strength of the high-latitude trophic system under increases in mean temperatures, even at DTF and potentially also at HW. 4. Our results underscore the importance of daily thermal fluctuations and heat waves in shaping predator-prey interactions, and may suggest an overall stabilizing contribution of predator thermal evolution ameliorating thermal plastic effects on food web stability.","[Wang, Ying-Jie; Tuzun, Nedim; Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium; [Sentis, Arnaud] Aix Marseille Univ, INRAE, UMR RECOVER, Aix En Provence, France","KU Leuven; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite","Wang, YJ (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium.","yingjie.wang@kuleuven.be","Tüzün, Nedim/H-8114-2019","Tüzün, Nedim/0000-0002-4743-1743; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459; Sentis, Arnaud/0000-0003-4617-3620","KU Leuven [C16/17/002]; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [G.0524.17N, G.0956.19N]","KU Leuven(KU Leuven); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(FWO)","KU Leuven, Grant/Award Number: C16/17/002; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, Grant/Award Number: G.0524.17N and G.0956.19N",NA,"61","7","7","7","21","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0269-8463","1365-2435","","FUNCT ECOL","Funct.

Some ectotherms possess the acclimatory capacity to shift seasonally their thermoregulatory behavior, but the frequent use of constant acclimation temperatures during experiments and the lack of information about thermal heterogeneity in the field obscures the ecological relevance of this plastic response. We examined the experimentally induced seasonal acclimation of preferred body temperatures (T-p) in alpine newts Ichthyosaura (formerly Triturus) alpestris subjected to a gradual increase in acclimation temperature from 5 degrees C during the winter to a constant 15 degrees C or diel fluctuations between 10 degrees and 20 degrees C during the spring/summer. Both the mean and range of T-p followed the increase in mean acclimation temperature without the influence of diel temperature fluctuations. The direction and magnitude of this acclimatory capacity has the potential to increase the time window available for thermoregulation. Although thermoregulation and thermal acclimation are often considered as separate but coadapted adjustments to thermal heterogeneity, their combined response is employed by newts to tackle seasonal variation in a thermoregulatory-challenging aquatic environment.","[Hadamova, Marketa; Gvozdik, Lumir] Biol AS CR, Inst Vertebrate, Dept Populat Biol, Konesin 67502, Czech Republic","Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Biology of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Gvozdik, L (corresponding author), Biol AS CR, Inst Vertebrate, Dept Populat Biol, Studenec 122, Konesin 67502, Czech Republic.","gvozdik@brno.cas.cz","Gvoždík, Lumír/G-1178-2014","Gvoždík, Lumír/0000-0002-6495-2233","Czech Science Foundation [P506/10/2170]; Czech Ministry of Education [LC06073]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion and Estacion Biologica de Donana, Spain","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Czech Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion and Estacion Biologica de Donana, Spain","We thank two anonymous reviewers for comments that substantially improved this article and R.

We tested with jacky dragons (Amphibolurus muricatus) the prediction that the accuracy and effectiveness of thermoregulation would decrease as the costs of thermoregulation increase using experimental arenas to manipulate environmental temperature fluctuation. The results supported theoretical predictions on the costs of thermoregulation - environments that were fluctuating led to decreased accuracy of thermoregulation (increased deviations in body temperatures from preferred temperatures) and reduced thermoregulatory effort (effectiveness). Moreover, environments with a mean temperature farther from the preferred temperature also led to greater deviations in body temperature, although this had no significant effect on effectiveness of thermoregulation. Together, the results highlight the need to understand what influences the costs of thermoregulation (i.e. thermal variation and mean), and how great of costs will be accepted for the benefits associated with thermoregulation.","[Schwanz, L.

In general, endothermic species, i.e., mammals and birds, maintain a constant body temperature (Tb) in fluctuating environmental temperatures using autonomic and behavioural mechanisms. Most of the knowledge on thermoregulatory physiology has emerged from studies using mammalian species, particularly rats. However, studies with all vertebrate groups are essential for a more complete understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of Tb. Ectothermic vertebrates-fish, amphibians and reptiles-thermoregulate essentially by behavioural mechanisms. With few exceptions, both endotherms and ectotherms develop fever (a regulated increase in Tb) in response to exogenous pyrogens, and regulated hypothermia (anapyrexia) in response to hypoxia. This review focuses on the mechanisms, particularly neuromediators and regions in the central nervous system, involved in thermoregulation in vertebrates, in conditions of euthermia, fever and anapyrexia.

Endothermic body temperatures are therefore relatively stable compared to external temperatures. The thermal sensitivity of biochemical reaction rates is thought to have co-evolved with body temperature regulation so that optimal reaction rates occur at the regulated body temperature. However, recent data show that core body temperatures even of non-torpid endotherms fluctuate considerably. Additionally, peripheral temperatures can be considerably lower and more variable than core body temperatures. Here we discuss whether published data support the hypothesis that thermal performance curves of physiological reaction rates are plastic so that performance is maintained despite variable body temperatures within active (non-torpid) endotherms, and we explore mechanisms that confer plasticity. There is evidence that thermal performance curves in tissues that experience thermal fluctuations can be plastic, although this question remains relatively unexplored for endotherms. Mechanisms that alter thermal responses locally at the tissue level include transient potential receptor ion channels (TRPV and TRPM) and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) both of which can influence metabolism and energy expenditure. Additionally, the thermal sensitivity of processes that cause post-transcriptional RNA degradation can promote the relative expression of cold-responsive genes. Endotherms can respond to environmental fluctuations similarly to ectotherms, and thermal plasticity complements core body temperature regulation to increase whole-organism performance. Thermal plasticity is ancestral to endothermic thermoregulation, but it has not lost its selective advantage so that modern endotherms are a physiological composite of ancestral ectothermic and derived endothermic traits.","[Seebacher, Frank] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Little, Alexander G.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA","University of Sydney; University of Miami","Seebacher, F (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.","frank.seebacher@sydney.edu.au","Little, Alexander G./AAZ-7704-2020","Little, Alexander G./0000-0002-9180-2919; Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311","Australian Research Council Discovery Grant [DP160102260]","Australian Research Council Discovery Grant(Australian Research Council)","This work was funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery Grant to FS (DP160102260).",NA,"100","8","8","1","27","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","PO BOX 110, EPFL INNOVATION PARK, BUILDING I, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-042X","","","FRONT PHYSIOL","Front.

However, the costs and benefits shaping the evolution of different thermal responses are poorly elucidated. One of the possible constraints to phenotypic plasticity is its intrinsic genetic cost, such as genetic linkage or pleiotropy. Genetic coupling of the thermal response curves for different life history traits may significantly affect the evolution of thermal sensitivity in thermally fluctuating environments. We used the collembolan Orchesella cincta to study if there is genetic variation in temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity in life history traits, and if the degree of temperature-induced plasticity is correlated across traits. Egg development rate, juvenile growth rate and egg size of 19 inbred isofemale lines were measured at two temperatures. Our results show that temperature was a highly significant factor for all three traits. Egg development rate and juvenile growth rate increased with increasing temperature, while egg size decreased. Line by temperature interaction was significant for all traits tested; indicating that genetic variation for temperature-induced plasticity existed. The degree of plasticity was significantly positively correlated between egg development rate and growth rate, but plasticity in egg size was not correlated to the other two plasticity traits. The findings suggest that the thermal plasticities of egg development rate and growth rate are partly under the control of the same genes or genetic regions. Hence, evolution of the thermal plasticity of traits cannot be understood in isolation of the response of other traits. If traits have similar and additive effects on fitness, genetic coupling between these traits may well facilitate the evolution of optimal phenotypes. However, for this we need to know the selective forces under field conditions.","[Ellers, Jacintha; Driessen, Gerard] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Inst Ecol Sci, Dept Anim Ecol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","Ellers, J (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Inst Ecol Sci, Dept Anim Ecol, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.","jacintha.ellers@falw.vu.nl","Ellers, Jacintha/K-5823-2012","Ellers, Jacintha/0000-0003-2665-1971","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [ALW-812.04.002, 864.03.003]","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO))","We thank Tom van Dooren for commenting on an earlier version of the manuscript.

They have since colonised grassy biomes such as savannas. These open environments have more extreme conditions than tropical forests, notably wider extremes of temperature and lower precipitation levels and greater temporal fluctuations (of both annual and diurnal variation). These conditions are challenging for soft-bodied ectotherms, such as termites, to survive in, let alone become as ecologically dominant as termites have. Here, we quantified termite thermal limits to test the hypothesis that these physiological limits are wider in savanna termite species to facilitate their existence in savanna environments. We sampled termites directly from mound structures, across an environmental gradient in Ghana, ranging from wet tropical forest through to savanna. At each location, we quantified both the Critical Thermal Maxima (CTmax) and the Critical Thermal Minima (CTmin) of all the most abundant mound-building Termitidae species in the study areas. We modelled the thermal limits in two separate mixed-effects models against canopy cover at the mound, temperature and rainfall, as fixed effects, with sampling location as a random intercept. For both CTmax and CTmin, savanna species had significantly more extreme thermal limits than forest species. Between and within environments, areas with higher amounts of canopy cover were significantly associated with lower CTmax values of the termite colonies. CTmin was significantly positively correlated with rainfall. Temperature was retained in both models; however, it did not have a significant relationship in either. Sampling location explained a large proportion of the residual variation, suggesting there are other environmental factors that could influence termite thermal limits. Our results suggest that savanna termite species have wider thermal limits than forest species. These physiological differences, in conjunction with other behavioural adaptations, are likely to have enabled termites to cope with the more extreme environmental conditions found in savanna environments and facilitated their expansion into open tropical environments.","[Woon, Joel S.; Parr, Catherine L.] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Woon, Joel S.; Eggleton, Paul] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, London, England; [Atkinson, David] Univ Liverpool, Dept Evolut Ecol & Behav, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Adu-Bredu, Stephen] CSIR Forestry Res Inst Ghana, Kumasi, Ghana; [Adu-Bredu, Stephen] CSIR Coll Sci & Technol, Dept Nat Resources Management, Kumasi, Ghana; [Parr, Catherine L.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, Pretoria, South Africa; [Parr, Catherine L.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Anim Plant & Environm Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa","University of Liverpool; Natural History Museum London; University of Liverpool; University of Pretoria; University of Witwatersrand","Woon, JS (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.;Woon, JS (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, London, England.","j.woon@liverpool.ac.uk","; Atkinson, David/D-4664-2009; Eggleton, Paul/A-3155-2015","Woon, Joel/0000-0003-2900-266X; Atkinson, David/0000-0002-9956-2454; Eggleton, Paul/0000-0002-1420-7518","Royal Society-DFID/FCDO Capacity Building Initiative; NERC ACCE DTP","Royal Society-DFID/FCDO Capacity Building Initiative; NERC ACCE DTP","Royal Society-DFID/FCDO Capacity Building Initiative; NERC ACCE DTP",NA,"96","0","0","5","6","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-8790","1365-2656","","J ANIM ECOL","J.

Fish are ectotherms so that their body temperature fluctuates with the temperature of the surrounding water. Changes in water temperature can thus have major effects on the physiology of fish, in particular their feeding. The mechanisms by which appetite is influenced by changes in temperatures in fish remain unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of temperature on feeding behavior, food intake and the expression of appetite regulators in three characid fish (black tetra, neon tetra and cavefish) by submitting them to four different temperatures for 2 weeks (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 32 degrees C). In all species, food intake increased with increasing temperature. In neon and black tetras, increasing temperatures decreased expressions of orexin and leptin and increased that of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART). In cavefish, temperature had no effect on brain orexin, leptin or CART. In all three species, higher temperatures induced increases in intestine expression of cholecystokinin (CCK), but no effects were seen for intestine ghrelin and peptide YY expressions. Our results show that temperature affects feeding in Characidae fish and induces species-specific changes in the expression of appetite regulators.","[Kuhn, Jannik; Azari, Sepideh; Volkoff, Helene] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NL A1B 3X9, Canada; [Kuhn, Jannik] Hsch Mannheim Univ, D-68163 Mannheim, Germany","Memorial University Newfoundland","Volkoff, H (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Biol, St John, NL A1B 3X9, Canada.","hvolkoff@mun.ca","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery (DG) [261414-03]","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery (DG)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery (DG, grant number 261414-03) to HV.

The ability to optimize energy acquisition to this episodic thermal oscillation may determine the survival, growth and development of these ectotherms. We compared the physiological and molecular responses of Haliotis discus hannai cultivated in suspended cages to fluctuating or stable temperature conditions. Several physiological indicators (respiration, excretion rates and O:N) were measured in both conditions, and alterations in the proteome during thermal fluctuations were assessed. No summer mortality was observed in abalone cultivated in fluctuating temperatures compared with that at stable high temperatures. Metabolic rates increased sharply during stable warm summer conditions and fluctuated in accordance with short-term temperature fluctuations (20-26 degrees C). Ammonia excretion rates during acute responses were comparable in both conditions. When abalone were exposed to fluctuating temperatures, enzyme activities were downregulated and structure-related protein expression was upregulated compared with that at an acclimation temperature (26 degrees C), highlighting that exposure to low temperatures during fluctuations alters molecular processes.

The most important parameter estimated by the SSI model is the intrinsic optimum temperature (T-Phi), which is the temperature at which the probability of an enzyme being in its active state is maximal. It has been also suggested that T-Phi authentically represents the optimal ambient temperature for fitness in ectotherms. We applied the SSI model to larvae of four aquatic decapod crustacean species distributed in cold, temperate, and tropical waters for understanding thermal adaptation in decapods. As a result, T-Phi's estimates for the larvae corresponded to the optimum temperatures for larval survival/growth. The estimates also changed in accordance with the geographical distribution of the stages, species, and populations studied, i.e., 6.91-9.06 degrees C for cold-water species and 19.68-27.00 degrees C for temperate and tropical species. It would be useful to examine the relationship between changes in geographical distribution with temperature T-Phi and population size for a better understanding of population fluctuations under global climate change.

In our study, we investigated the physiological costs of diel temperature fluctuations of vertical migration in the neritic marine copepod Centropages typicus, and checked whether the direct effects of fluctuating temperature on copepod performance may differ from those of average temperature conditions (Jensen's inequality). We determined the rates of egestion, egg production, and respiration of copepods exposed to four temperature regimes including one treatment that simulated diel vertical migration (DVM, 10 h at 14 degrees C and 14 h at 19 degrees C) and three treatments with constant temperature (14, 17 and 19 degrees C). We found that the physiological performance of C. typicus was not significantly different between fluctuating (DVM) and average (17 degrees C) temperature conditions, thus indicating that differences between varying and average temperature effects might not emerge in migrant zooplankton exposed to thermal variations of moderate magnitude (5 oC). The copepods exposed to fluctuating temperature mimicking vertical migration (DVM) showed better performance (e.g. higher egg production) than those exposed to constant depth conditions (14 degrees C); however, no significant differences were detected when compared to constant surface conditions (19 degrees C). Our study indicates that neritic marine copepods experiencing daily moderate temperature fluctuations through vertical migration may not suffer physiological costs due to temperature associated with this behaviour. In this sense, these animals might have physiological mechanisms to compensate diel temperature fluctuations, which would represent a particularly relevant preadaptation to cope with the increased thermal variability predicted in future climates.","[Olivares, Manuel; Calbet, Albert; Saiz, Enric] Inst Ciencies Mar ICM, CSIC, Pg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro Mediterraneo de Investigaciones Marinas y Ambientales (CMIMA); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM)","Olivares, M (corresponding author), Inst Ciencies Mar ICM, CSIC, Pg Maritim Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.","molivares@icm.csic.es","Calbet, Albert/A-7779-2008","Calbet, Albert/0000-0003-1069-212X; Olivares, Manuel/0000-0002-7473-6323","project ZOOTHERM (MICIU/AEI/FEDER, UE) [CTM2017-84288-R]; FPU grant from the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport [FPU15/01747]","project ZOOTHERM (MICIU/AEI/FEDER, UE); FPU grant from the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport(Spanish Government)","This study was framed within the project ZOOTHERM (CTM2017-84288-R, MICIU/AEI/FEDER, UE), and Manuel Olivares was supported financially by an FPU grant (FPU15/01747) from the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport.",NA,"89","1","1","0","6","SPRINGER BASEL AG","BASEL","PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND","1015-1621","1420-9055","","AQUAT SCI","Aquat.

The coupling of annual light-temperature regimes also drives complementary seasonal cycles of energy supply (primary production) and demand (metabolism), perhaps promoting temporal stability in carbon (C) storage and food web production that may be difficult to discern in most ecosystems. Spring-fed streams in the Arctic are subject to extreme annual fluctuations in light availability but have relatively stable water temperatures, which allows assessment of the independent effects of light and temperature. We used the unusual annual light and temperature regimes of Ivishak Spring, Alaska, USA (latitude 69 degrees N, annual water temperature range 4-7 degrees C) to test predictions about the effect of light availability on consumer productivity with minimally confounding effects of temperature. We predicted that (1) annual patterns of secondary production would follow patterns of primary production, rather than temperature, due to organic C limitation during winter darkness when photosynthesis is effectively halted, (2) C limitation would propagate from primary producers upward through several trophic levels, (3) the lack of temperature dependence during winter darkness would be expressed as anomalous Arrhenius plots of growth rates indicating decoupled production-temperature relationships, and (4) consumer diets would reflect C limitation during winter. As predicted, we found (1) lowest production by macroinvertebrates and Salvelinus malma (Dolly Varden char) at the lowest light levels rather than the lowest temperatures, (2) apparent winter C limitation propagated upward through three trophic levels, (3) anomalous Arrhenius plots indicating lack of temperature dependence of consumer growth rates during winter, and (4) lowest consumption of diatoms (by macroinvertebrates) and invertebrate prey (by S. malma) during winter. Together, these results indicate that light drives annual patterns of animal production in Ivishak Spring, with stable annual temperatures likely exacerbating C limitation of ectotherm metabolism during winter. The timing and severity of winter C limitation in this unusual Arctic-spring food web highlight a fundamental role for light-temperature synchrony in matching energy supply with demand in most other ecosystem types, thereby conferring a measure of stability in the metabolism of their food webs over annual time scales.","[Huryn, Alexander D.; Benstead, Jonathan P.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa","Huryn, AD (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.","huryn@bama.ua.edu","","","National Science Foundation [OPP-0611995, DEB-1637459]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank Naomi Whitty and Matt Irinaga (CH2M HILL Polar Services) for logistical support, and Ed Serrano, Pele Tierney, Jonas Calvillo, Bryan Minnear, Don Herbert, Ryan Porhola, and Scott Nicholson for helicopter transportation to Ivishak Spring.

Most tests of the model focus on morphological proxies of fitness, such as size traits, whereas early life physiological traits that are closely related to lifetime fitness might provide a framework for generalizing the Charnov-Bull model across taxa. One such trait is the strength of the early-life immune response, which is strongly linked to early-life survival and fitness. Here, we manipulated temperature, variance in temperature, and sex to test the Charnov-Bull model using a physiological trait, immune system strength, in the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina). We found no evidence of sex-specific differences in bactericidal capacity of hatchling blood, and no evidence that mean temperature influences bactericidal capacity. However, we did find that fluctuating incubation temperature (i.e. a more naturalized incubation regime) is associated with a greater bactericidal capacity compared with constant temperature incubation. We also found that egg mass, a proxy for maternal provisioning, is positively associated with bactericidal capacity. Our findings suggest that the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles is unrelated to our measure of early-life innate immunity. Our study also underlines how immune response is condition dependent in early life, and questions the biological relevance of constant temperature incubation in experimental studies on ectotherm development.","[Leivesley, Jessica Alice; Rollinson, Njal] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Rollinson, Njal] Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, Toronto, ON M5S 3E8, Canada","University of Toronto; University of Toronto","Leivesley, JA (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.","jessica.leivesley@mail.utoronto.ca","Leivesley, Jessica/GLT-2651-2022","Rollinson, Njal/0000-0002-5091-8368; Leivesley, Jessica/0000-0002-3620-975X","University of Toronto; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant [RGPIN-2016-06469]","University of Toronto(University of Toronto); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","This work was supported by the University of Toronto and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant to N.R.

Smaller cells speed metabolism during periods of warming but require more energy to maintain and repair. To evaluate this theory, we studied the evolution of cell size in populations of Drosophila melanogaster held at either a constant temperature (16 degrees C or 25 degrees C) or fluctuating temperatures (16 and 25 degrees C). Populations that evolved at fluctuating temperatures or a constant 25 degrees C developed smaller thoraxes, wings, and cells than did flies exposed to a constant 16 degrees C. The cells of flies from fluctuating environments were intermediate in size to those of flies from constant environments. Most genetic variation in cell size was independent of variation in wing size, suggesting that cell size was a target of selection. These evolutionary patterns accord with patterns of developmental plasticity documented previously. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms that underlie the selective advantage of small cells at high or fluctuating temperatures.","[Adrian, Gregory J.; Angilletta, Michael J., Jr.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Czarnoleski, Marcin] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland","Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Jagiellonian University","Angilletta, MJ (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.","angilletta@asu.edu","Czarnoleski, Marcin/H-2893-2015","Czarnoleski, Marcin/0000-0003-2645-0360","Barrett Honors College at ASU; National Science Center in Poland [NN304 373238]; Jagiellonian University [DS/WBINS/ INOS/757/2015]","Barrett Honors College at ASU; National Science Center in Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); Jagiellonian University","We thank Max Zelic and Bruno Moreira for their help with the experiment and Kenro Kusumi for access to laboratory equipment.

Oxygen consumption rate (VO2) was determined for 11-15 subsamples of individuals at 4 degrees, 11 degrees and 21 degrees C with silver/platinum oxygen electrodes. Multiple factor analysis of variance (MFANOVA) of log(10) transformed values of whole animal VO2 with log(10) dry tissue weight (DTW) as a covariant revealed that increased test temperature induced a significant increase in VO2 in both species (P<0.00001). In contrast, MFANOVA revealed that temperature acclimation did not affect VO2 in either L. saxatilis (P = 0.35) or L. obtusata (P = 0.095). Thus, neither species displayed a capacity for the typical metabolic temperature compensation marked by an increase in VO2 at any one test temperature in individuals acclimated to a lower temperature that is characteristic of most ectothermic animals. Lack of capacity for metabolic temperature acclimation has also been reported in other littorinid snail species, and may be characteristic of the group as a whole. Lack of capacity for respiratory temperature acclimation in these two species and other littorinids may reflect the extensive semi-diurnal temperature variation that they are exposed to in their eulittoral and eulittoral fringe/maritime zone habitats. In these habitats, any metabolic benefits derived from longer-term temperature compensation of metabolic rates are negated by extreme daily temperature fluctuations. Instead, littorinid species appear to have evolved mechanisms for immediate metabolic regulation which, in L. saxatilis and L. obtusata and other littorinids, appear to centre on a unique ability for near instantaneous suppression of metabolic rate and entrance into short-term metabolic diapause at temperatures above 20-35 degrees C, making typical seasonal respiratory compensation mechanisms characteristic of most ectotherms of little adaptive value to littorinid species.","MARINE BIOL LAB, WOODS HOLE, MA 02543 USA; SYRACUSE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, SYRACUSE, NY 13210 USA; N CAROLINA AGR & TECH STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, GREENSBORO, NC 27411 USA","Marine Biological Laboratory - Woods Hole; Syracuse University; University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University","MCMAHON, RF (corresponding author), UNIV TEXAS, DEPT BIOL, COMPARAT PHYSIOL SECT, BOX 19498, ARLINGTON, TX 76019 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"44","22","22","0","23","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0018-8158","1573-5117","","HYDROBIOLOGIA","Hydrobiologia","AUG 4","1995","309","1-3","",NA,"",NA,"89","100","","10.1007/BF00014475","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014475","","","12","Marine & Freshwater Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Marine & Freshwater Biology","TD867",NA,"","","","2022-12-01","WOS:A1995TD86700010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Temperate ectotherms may be adapted to the seasonal fluctuations in environmental traits. For lizards, behavioural adaptations regarding microhabitat selection could arise to improve thermoregulation during the different seasons. However, little is still known about which traits influence microhabitat selection of lizards and their adaptation to seasonality. Here we used Podarcis guadarramae to study the role of potential intrinsic (body size, sex, age) and environmental traits (air and substrate temperatures, wind speed, and sunlight) in the seasonal changes of body temperatures and microhabitat selection of lizards. We measured body temperatures of lizards in the same habitat during the four seasons and compared the climatic variables of the microhabitats selected by lizards with the mean climatic conditions available in their habitat. Body temperatures were similar for adult males, adult females, and juveniles within each season, being significantly higher in summer than in the other seasons, and in spring than in winter. The same pattern was found regarding substrate and air temperatures of the selected microhabitats. Wind speed and air temperature did not affect body temperatures, while body length was marginally significant and substrate temperatures and season did affect the body temperatures of lizards. Our results during the whole year support the idea that the seasonality could be the most important factor affecting body temperatures of these temperate species. Regarding micro habitat selection, environmental constraints, as environmental temperatures and wind speed, affected the seasonal changes on behavioural thermoregulation of lizards. This effect was similar between sexes and age classes, and was independent of body size. In addition, importance of sunlight exposure of the selected microhabitats (full sun, filtered sun, or shade) also changed between seasons. Hence, environmental constraints were the main forces driving seasonal changes in microhabitat selection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Under predictable variation in environmental temperatures, theory predicts that selection favours acclimation of thermal performance curves over fixed phenotypes. We examined the influence of diel fluctuations in developmental temperatures on the thermal sensitivity of the maximal swimming capacity in larvae of the alpine newt, Triturus alpestris. We incubated newt eggs under three thermal regimes with varying daily amplitudes (1, 5 and 9 degrees C) and similar means (17 center dot 6-17 center dot 9 degrees C), and accordingly we measured the swimming speed of hatched larvae at three experimental temperatures (12, 17 and 22 degrees C), which they would normally experience in their natural habitat. Embryonic development under low and middle temperature fluctuations produced larvae with similar swimming speeds across experimental temperatures. In contrast, the most fluctuating regime induced development of phenotypes, which at 12 degrees C swam faster than larvae developed under moderate diel fluctuations. Our results provide evidence that diel temperature fluctuations induce acclimation of thermal dependence of locomotor performance. In ectotherms experiencing diel cycles in environmental temperatures, this plastic response may act as an important pacemaker in the evolution of thermal sensitivity.","[Merakova, Eva; Gvozdik, Lumir] Inst Vertebrate Biol AS CR, Dept Populat Biol, Konesin 67502, Czech Republic","Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Biology of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Gvozdik, L (corresponding author), Inst Vertebrate Biol AS CR, Dept Populat Biol, Studenec 122, Konesin 67502, Czech Republic.","gvozdik@brno.cas.cz","ASCR, IVB/A-9883-2011; Gvoždík, Lumír/G-1178-2014","Gvoždík, Lumír/0000-0002-6495-2233","Czech Science Foundation [206/06/0953]; Czech Ministry of Education [LC06073]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Czech Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","We thank R.

Despite considerable attention being dedicated to the study of thermally-induced developmental plasticity, whether or not interspecific interactions shape the plastic response in both a predator and its prey remains unknown. We tested several predictions about the joint influence of predator/prey scents and thermal conditions on the plasticity of preferred body temperatures (T (p)) in both actors of this interaction, using a dragonfly nymphs-newt larvae system. Dragonfly nymphs (Aeshna cyanea) and newt eggs (Ichthyosaura alpestris) were subjected to fluctuating cold and warm thermal regimes (7-12 and 12-22A degrees C, respectively) and the presence/absence of a predator or prey chemical cues. Preferred body temperatures were measured in an aquatic thermal gradient (5-33A degrees C) over a 24-h period. Newt T (p) increased with developmental temperature irrespective of the presence/absence of predator cues. In dragonflies, thermal reaction norms for T (p) were affected by the interaction between temperature and prey cues. Specifically, the presence of newt scents in cold regime lowered dragonfly T (p). We concluded that predator-prey interactions influenced thermally-induced plasticity of T (p) but not in a reciprocal fashion. The occurrence of frequency-dependent thermal plasticity may have broad implications for predator-prey population dynamics, the evolution of thermal biology traits, and the consequences of sustaining climate change within ecological communities.","[Smolinsky, Radovan; Gvozdik, Lumir] Inst Vertebrate Biol AS CR, Dept Populat Biol, Konesin 67502, Czech Republic","Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Biology of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Gvozdik, L (corresponding author), Inst Vertebrate Biol AS CR, Dept Populat Biol, Studenec 122, Konesin 67502, Czech Republic.","gvozdik@brno.cas.cz","Smolinsky, Radovan/F-9730-2014; Gvoždík, Lumír/G-1178-2014","Gvoždík, Lumír/0000-0002-6495-2233","Czech Science Foundation [P506/10/2170]; Czech Ministry of Education [LC06073]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Czech Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","We thank to four anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments on the previous versions of this paper.

For ectotherms, in particular, temperature has a strong influence on habitat choice. While well studied at the species level, less is known about factors affecting the preferred temperature of individuals; especially lacking is information on how physiological traits are linked to thermal preference and whether such relationships are affected by factors such feeding history and growth trajectory. This study examined these issues in the common minnow Phoxinus phoxinus, to determine the extent to which feeding history, standard metabolic rate (SMR) and aerobic scope (AS), interact to affect temperature preference. Individuals were either: 1) food deprived (FD) for 21days, then fed ad libitum for the next 74days; or 2) fed ad libitum throughout the entire period. All animals were then allowed to select preferred temperatures using a shuttle-box, and then measured for SMR and AS at 10 degrees C, estimated by rates of oxygen uptake. Activity within the shuttle-box under a constant temperature regime was also measured. In both FD and control fish, SMR was negatively correlated with preferred temperature. The SMR of the FD fish was increased compared with the controls, probably due to the effects of compensatory growth, and so these growth-compensated fish preferred temperatures that were on average 285 degrees C cooler than controls fed a maintenance ration throughout the study. Fish experiencing compensatory growth also displayed a large reduction in activity. In growth-compensated fish and controls, activity measured at 10 degrees C was positively correlated with preferred temperature. Individual fish prefer temperatures that vary predictably with SMR and activity level, which are both plastic in response to feeding history and growth trajectories. Cooler temperatures probably allow individuals to reduce maintenance costs and divert more energy towards growth. A reduction in SMR at cooler temperatures, coupled with a decrease in spontaneous activity, could also allow individuals to increase surplus AS for coping with environmental stressors. In warming climates, however, aquatic ectotherms could experience frequent fluctuations in food supply with long-lasting effects on metabolic rate due to compensatory growth, while simultaneously having limited access to preferred cooler habitats.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","University of Glasgow","Killen, SS (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.","shaun.killen@glasgow.ac.uk","","Killen, Shaun/0000-0003-4949-3988","UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC); Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G013896/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/G013896/1] Funding Source: UKRI","UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This study was funded by a UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) research fellowship.

However, not all intertidal ectotherms face the same exposure risk. In northern regions of the eastern Pacific, summertime low tides occur during midday, exposing ectotherms to potentially stressful temperatures, whereas cooler pre-dawn low tides in southern regions buffer ectotherms from thermal stress. Gumboot chitons Cryptochiton stelleri are thermally sensitive intertidal grazers that range from southern California to Alaska, exposing them to a mosaic of thermal stresses. We quantified chiton thermal performance limits in the laboratory by testing the effects of elevated air and water temperatures on grazing. We also compared the thermoregulation efficiency of chitons from thermally benign northern California sites with those from thermally stressful San Juan Island, Washington sites, using 3 components: (1) biomimetic thermal models deployed intertidally, (2) chiton body temperatures in the field, and (3) chiton thermal preference in a laboratory-based thermal gradient. We found that chiton grazing performance was greatly reduced at 18 degrees C in water, and they reached their grazing performance limit after exposure to 20 degrees C in air, confirming previous work documenting thermal limits on chiton respiration. Chitons preferred body temperatures within 3 degrees C of their thermal performance limits, but they rarely achieved body temperatures that would maximize grazing in the field. This suggests that chitons are not thermoregulating efficiently with respect to maximizing grazing performance, but instead are minimizing exposure to temperatures that would be detrimental to their performance.","[McIntire, Lily C.] Humboldt State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [McIntire, Lily C.] Telonicher Marine Lab, 570 Ewing St, Trinidad, CA 95570 USA","California State University System; California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt","McIntire, LC (corresponding author), Humboldt State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Arcata, CA 95521 USA.","Lily.McIntire@humboldt.edu","","","California State University Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology (CSU-COAST); Humboldt Marine and Coastal Sciences Institute (MCSI); Pacific Northwest Shell Club; Western Society of Malacologists; Brusca family; HSU Biology Graduate Student Association; Sigma Xi; FHL; Malcolm Oliphant Graduate Fund","California State University Council on Ocean Affairs, Science & Technology (CSU-COAST); Humboldt Marine and Coastal Sciences Institute (MCSI); Pacific Northwest Shell Club; Western Society of Malacologists; Brusca family; HSU Biology Graduate Student Association; Sigma Xi; FHL; Malcolm Oliphant Graduate Fund","We thank the directors and staff at TML and the University of Washington Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL) for logistical support.

While mammalian body temperature fluctuates throughout the day, small ectotherms, such as Drosophila, achieve a body temperature rhythm (BTR) through their preference of environmental temperature. Here, we demonstrate that pigment dispersing factor (PDF) neurons play an important role in setting preferred temperature before dawn. We show that small lateral ventral neurons (sLNvs), a subset of PDF neurons, activate the dorsal neurons 2 (DN2s), the main circadian clock cells that regulate temperature preference rhythm (TPR). The number of temporal contacts between sLNvs and DN2s peak before dawn. Our data suggest that the thermosensory Anterior Cells (ACs) likely contact sLNvs via serotonin signaling. Together, the ACs-sLNs-DN2s neural circuit regulates the proper setting of temperature preference before dawn. Given that sLNvs are important for sleep and that BTR and sleep have a close temporal relationship, our data highlight a possible neuronal interaction between body temperature and sleep regulation.","[Tang, Xin; Hayley, Sean E.; Chu, Michelle L.; Hamada, Fumika N.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, Abrahamson Pediat Eye Inst, Visual Syst Grp, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Roessingh, Sanne; Stanewsky, Ralf] UCL, Dept Cell & Dev Biol, London, England; [Roessingh, Sanne; Wolfgang, Werner] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England; [Tanaka, Nobuaki K.] Hokkaido Univ, Creat Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Tanaka, Nobuaki K.; Hamada, Fumika N.] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Saitama, Japan; [Song, Seongho] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Math Sci, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Hamada, Fumika N.] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Hamada, Fumika N.] Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA; [Stanewsky, Ralf] Westfal Wilhelms Univ, Inst Neuro & Behav Biol, Munster, Germany","Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; University of London; University College London; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Hokkaido University; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; University of Munster","Hamada, FN (corresponding author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Pediat Ophthalmol, Abrahamson Pediat Eye Inst, Visual Syst Grp, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.;Hamada, FN (corresponding author), Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, PRESTO, Saitama, Japan.;Hamada, FN (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Coll Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Cincinnati, OH USA.;Hamada, FN (corresponding author), Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr, Div Dev Biol, Cincinnati, OH 45229 USA.","fumika.hamada@cchmc.org","Stanewsky, Ralf/ABB-9193-2021","Chu, Michelle/0000-0003-0331-6118; Stanewsky, Ralf/0000-0001-8238-6864; Roessingh, Sanne/0000-0002-5318-6369","Japan Science and Technology Agency PRESTO; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Seventh Framework Programme; March of Dimes Foundation Basil O'Connor Starter Scholar Research Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R01GM107582] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; BBSRC [BB/H001204/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Japan Science and Technology Agency PRESTO(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Seventh Framework Programme(European Commission); March of Dimes Foundation Basil O'Connor Starter Scholar Research Award; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","Japan Science and Technology Agency PRESTO Nobuaki K Tanaka Fumika N Hamada; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council Ralf Stanewsky; Seventh Framework Programme Ralf Stanewsky; National Institutes of Health R01 grant GM107582 Fumika N Hamada; March of Dimes Foundation Basil O'Connor Starter Scholar Research Award Fumika N Hamada; The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.",NA,"78","26","26","0","16","ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND","2050-084X","","","ELIFE","eLife","MAY 2","2017","6","","",NA,"",NA,"","","e23206","10.7554/eLife.23206","http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23206","","","23","Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics","EW2DU","28463109","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000402307500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Forecasts indicate a worldwide temperature rise of 1.4-6 degrees C by 2100, and an increase in heatwave frequency is expected. This study investigated the effects of constant temperatures (CT; 27, 34, 39, 40 and 41 degrees C) and fluctuating temperature (FT; 27/34 degrees C: 12/12 h) on the survival, metabolic rate, locomotor activity, gas exchange pattern, heat loss and water content of the male Jamaican field cricket, Gryllus assimilis (Fabricius, 1775) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). It was found that 39 degrees C was the estimated lethal temperature for 50% of the population and that 41 degrees C was considered the thermal limit, causing 100% mortality in 96 h. Furthermore, FT caused slightly higher mortality (8.9 +/- 3.8%) than CT27 (0%) and CT34 (1.43 +/- 1.43%). FT caused a greater increase in the metabolic rate and locomotor activity than CT27. It was found that G. assimilis males had a continuous gas exchange as a standard at CT27; however, CT34 changed the gas exchange pattern from continuous to cyclic in 27% of crickets. FT decreased heat loss in crickets more than CT34; however, no significant differences were found in locomotor activity and metabolic rate. In addition, no significant differences between CT27, CT34 and FT were observed in terms of water content, thus suggesting no difference in water loss. Thus, it is suggested that FT, despite involving a modest warming, increased the climate sensitivity of G. assimilis males and led to a change in their optimum temperature, pushing it beyond its usual thermal limits. However, higher mortality in FT compared to CT27 (control) and CT34 must be interpreted with caution. In addition, the risk of higher mortality of G. assimilis males is predicted, especially in South America, where this cricket is widely distributed.","[Centeno Filho, Boaventura Lobo; Limberger, Guilherme Martins; Maciel, Fabio Everton] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Programa Posgraduacao Ciencias Fisiol, Inst Ciencias Biol, Ave Italia, Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, Rio Grande do S, Brazil; [da Fonseca, Duane Barros] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Ciencias Biol, Ave Italia,Km 8,Campus Carreiros, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, Rio Grande do S, Brazil","Universidade Federal do Rio Grande; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande","Maciel, FE (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Programa Posgraduacao Ciencias Fisiol, Inst Ciencias Biol, Ave Italia, Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, Rio Grande do S, Brazil.","maciel-fe@hotmail.com","","Lobo Centeno Filho, Boaventura/0000-0001-8096-4632; Martins Limberger, Guilherme/0000-0001-7278-7293","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001]","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES))","We thank the crew of Laboratory of Terrestrial Invertebrates for help with crickets rearing maintenance.

The experimental results from Hb solutions revealed a direct correlation between protein resilience, melting temperature and average body temperature of the different species on the 0.1 ns time scale. Molecular forces appeared to be adapted to permit conformational fluctuations with a root mean square displacement close to 1.2 angstrom at the corresponding average body temperature of the endotherms. Strong forces within crocodile Hb maintain the amplitudes of motion within a narrow limit over the entire temperature range in which the animal lives. In fully hydrated powder samples of human and chicken, Hb mean square displacements and effective force constants on the 1 ns time scale showed no differences over the whole temperature range from 10 to 300 K, in contrast to the solution case. A complementary result of the study, therefore, is that one hydration layer is not sufficient to activate all conformational fluctuations of Hb in the pico- to nanosecond time scale which might be relevant for biological function. Coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations permitted to explore residue-specific effects. They indicated that temperature sensing of human and chicken Hb occurs mainly at residues lining internal cavities in the beta-subunits.","[Stadler, A.

These temperature events, heatwaves for example, will impact a wide range of physiological and behavioural processes, particularly in ectotherms, and may therefore influence interactions between species. 2. Anti-predator responses may be more costly under more severe temperature regimes and therefore trait-mediated disturbance could lead to high mortality or reduced reproduction under extreme and fluctuating temperature regimes. 3. We examined the impacts of extreme and fluctuating temperatures on trait-mediated indirect interactions in an aphid-parasitoid community. 4. In treatments that isolated the effects of trait-mediated disturbance from the effects of foraging parasitoids we found that an increase in both the amplitude and frequency of peak temperatures reduced aphid numbers and provided evidence that the cost of trait-mediated disturbance could increase under frequent periods of high temperature. Aphid dispersal also increased with more frequent periods of high temperature. 5. In treatments where female wasps were allowed to freely forage (direct + trait-mediated effects), there was no evidence that extreme and fluctuating temperatures influenced the wasp's foraging ability. Exposure to extreme fluctuating temperatures did not influence the offspring production of exposed wasps or the position of the mummies within the plots.","[Bannerman, Jordan A.; Gillespie, David R.; Roitberg, Bernard D.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Gillespie, David R.] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Pacific Agri Food Res Ctr, Agassiz, BC, Canada","Simon Fraser University; Agriculture & Agri Food Canada","Bannerman, JA (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.","jab32@sfu.ca","","","NSERC","NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","This work would not have been possible without the help of P.

Extreme temperature events are short periods of high temperature (i.e., >95th percentile of temperature distribution), and their occurrences are difficult to predict. These extreme temperature events pose great challenges to living organisms, especially ectotherms such as insects whose body temperature is greatly influenced by environmental temperature. Temperature is known to play an essential role in driving insect performance as well as inducing behavioral changes. Exposure to extreme temperatures causes physiological damage leading to potential long-lasting effects on insect performance. We aimed at assessing the impact of direct (i.e., current) and indirect (previously experienced) exposure to extreme temperature on the oviposition success of Diadegma semiclausum Hellen (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). Diadegma semiclausum is a larval endoparasitoid of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), a worldwide pest of brassicaceous crops. Oviposition success, measured as the percentage of parasitized P. xylostella, was significantly lower at 33 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. However, previous exposure to 33 degrees C did not significantly impact the egg-laying performance of D. semiclausum, indicating that, after a heatwave, the egg-laying performance can recover. Neither the direct nor indirect exposure to extreme temperature altered D. semiclausum host-instar preference. These results indicate that temperature directly impacts D. semiclausum parasitism performance, although more detailed research is needed to disentangle direct physiological mechanisms from behavioral responses. Overall, these study results confirm others, suggesting that control of P. xylostella by D. semiclausum is likely to be impaired by more frequent heatwaves predicted under climate change scenarios.","[Costaz, Thibault P.

Understanding how such interactions persist in a thermally variable environment is particularly important given that most biodiversity on the planet consists of ectotherms whose body temperature depends on the environmental temperature. Here we present a trait-based mathematical framework for investigating how tri-trophic food chains persist in seasonal environments. We report two key findings. First, the persistence of the tri-trophic interaction is enhanced if species at upper trophic levels (e.g. top predators) are more cold-adapted than those at lower levels (e.g. basal resources) by virtue of lower thermal optima, wider response breadths and lower mortality within the favourable temperature range. The important implication is that the assembly and persistence of multi-trophic interactions requires that species at lower trophic levels be somewhat maladapted to their ambient thermal environment, as in the case of recent invasions. Second, differential sensitivity to thermally varying environments provides a mechanistic explanation for the conflict of interest between the intermediate consumer and top predator. The same cold-adaptations that increase the consumer's ability to increase when rare deter the predator's ability to do so. Thus, being well-adapted to its thermal environment makes the intermediate consumer better able to acquire resources and avoid predators. We predict that the hierarchy in cold-adaptation should constrain the number of trophic levels that can be supported in a given thermal environment, and that ectotherm food chain lengths should increase with increasing latitude because larger-amplitude seasonal fluctuations generate more opportunities for species to diverge in their thermal optima.","[Casas Goncalves, Guilherme; Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Goncalves, GC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","gui.casas@gmail.com","","Casas Goncalves, Guilherme/0000-0001-6231-1670","National Science Foundation [DEB-1949796]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: DEB-1949796",NA,"62","0","0","2","7","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-8790","1365-2656","","J ANIM ECOL","J.

Temperature compensation may either involve a change in absolute values of metabolic rates or a change in the slope of the metabolic rate-temperature relationship. Moreover, assessments of compensation may be complicated by animal responses to fluctuating temperatures. Here we examined whole animal metabolic rates, at 0 degrees C, 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C and 15 degrees C, in caterpillars of the sub-Antarctic moth, Pringleophaga marioni Viette (Tineidae), following one week acclimations to 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C and 15 degrees C, and fluctuating temperatures of 0-10 degrees C, 5-15 degrees C, and 10-20 degrees C. Over the short term, temperature compensation was found following acclimation to 5 degrees C, but the effect size was small (3-14%). By comparison with caterpillars of 13 other lepidopteran species, no effect of temperature compensation was present, with the relationship between metabolic rate and temperature having a Q(10) of 2 among species, and no effect of latitude on temperature-corrected metabolic rate. Fluctuating temperature acclimations for the most part had little effect compared with constant temperatures of the same mean value. Nonetheless, fluctuating temperatures of 5-15 degrees C resulted in lower metabolic rates at all test temperatures compared with constant 10 degrees C acclimation, in keeping with expectations from the literature. Absence of significant responses, or those of large effect, in metabolic rates in response to acclimation, may be a consequence of the unpredictable temperature variation over the short-term on sub-Antarctic Marion Island, to which P. marioni is endemic.

Reptiles inhabiting tropical highlands face extreme fluctuating daily temperatures, and extreme values and intervals of fluctuations vary with altitude. Anolis heterodermus occurs between 1800 m to 3750 m elevation in the tropical Andes, and is the Anolis species found at the highest altitude known. We evaluated which strategies populations from elevations of 2200 m, 2650 m and 3400 m use to cope with environmental temperatures. We measured body, preferred, critical maximum and minimum temperatures, and sprint speed at different body temperatures of individuals, as well as operative temperatures. Anolis heterodermus exhibits behavioral adjustments in response to changes in environmental temperatures across altitudes. Likewise, physiological traits exhibit intrapopulation variations, but they are similar among populations, tended to the static side of the evolution of thermal traits spectrum. The thermoregulatory behavioral strategy in this species is extremely plastic, and lizards adjust even to fluctuating environmental conditions from day to day. Unlike other Anolis species, at low thermal quality of the habitat, lizards are thermoconformers, particularly at the highest altitudes, where cloudy days can intensify this strategy even more. Our study reveals that the pattern of strategies for dealing with thermal ambient variations and their relation to extinction risks in the tropics that are caused by global warming is perhaps more complex for lizards than previously thought.","[Mendez-Galeano, Miguel A.; Felipe Paternina-Cruz, R.; Calderon-Espinosa, Martha L.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Inst Ciencias Nat, Grp Morfol & Ecol Evolut, Apartado 7495, Bogota, DC, Colombia","Universidad Nacional de Colombia","Mendez-Galeano, MA (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Colombia, Inst Ciencias Nat, Grp Morfol & Ecol Evolut, Apartado 7495, Bogota, DC, Colombia.","miamendezga@unal.edu.co","","","","","",NA,"72","3","4","1","22","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0306-4565","","","J THERM BIOL","J.

However, diurnal varying temperature regimes more commonly represent the environment in which most organisms thrive. Such varying temperature regimes have been demonstrated to substantially affect development and reproduction of ectothermic organisms, generally in accordance with Jensen's inequality. In the present study we evaluated the impact of temperature alternations at 4 amplitudes (DTR0, +5, +10 and + 15 degrees C) on the developmental rate of the predatory mites Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus McGregor (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and their natural prey, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). We have modelled their developmental rates as a function of temperature using both linear and nonlinear models. Diurnally alternating temperatures resulted in a faster development in the lower temperature range as compared to their corresponding mean constant temperatures, whereas the opposite was observed in the higher temperature range. Our results indicate that Jensen's inequality does not suffice to fully explain the differences in developmental rates at constant and alternating temperatures, suggesting additional physiological responses play a role. It is concluded that diurnal temperature range should not be ignored and should be incorporated in predictive models on the phenology of arthropod pests and their natural enemies and their performance in biological control programmes.","[Vangansbeke, Dominiek; Duc Tung Nguyen; Tirry, Luc; De Clercq, Patrick] Univ Ghent, Dept Crop Protect, Lab Agrozool, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Audenaert, Joachim; Verhoeven, Ruth; Gobin, Bruno] PCS Ornamental Plant Res, B-9070 Destelbergen, Belgium; [Duc Tung Nguyen] Vietnam Natl Univ Agr, Dept Entomol, Hanoi, Vietnam","Ghent University; Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA)","Vangansbeke, D (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Crop Protect, Lab Agrozool, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","dominiek.vangansbeke@Ugent.be","Nguyen, Duc Tung/P-1316-2017; De Clercq, Patrick/B-5721-2015","Nguyen, Duc Tung/0000-0002-8954-3604; De Clercq, Patrick/0000-0003-0664-1602","Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen) [090931]; PCS-Ornamental Plant Research","Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen)(Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT)); PCS-Ornamental Plant Research","This study was funded by the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen http://www.iwt.be/) (Project number 090931).

The roles played by alterations in gene expression in enabling eurytherms to adjust to these two temporally distinct patterns of thermal stress are poorly understood. We used cDNA microarray analysis to examine changes in gene expression in a eurythermal fish, Austrofundulus limnaeus, subjected to long-term acclimation to constant temperatures of 20, 26 and 37degreesC and to environmentally realistic daily fluctuations in temperature between 20degreesC and 37degreesC. Our data reveal major differences between the transcriptional responses in the liver made during acclimation to constant temperatures and in response to daily temperature fluctuations. Control of cell growth and proliferation appears to be an important part of the response to change in temperature, based on large-scale changes in mRNA transcript levels for several key regulators of these pathways. However, cell growth and proliferation appear to be regulated by different genes in constant versus fluctuating temperature regimes. The gene expression response of molecular chaperones is also different between constant and fluctuating temperatures. Small heat shock proteins appear to play an important role in response to fluctuating temperatures whereas larger molecular mass chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 respond more strongly to chronic high temperatures. A number of transcripts that encode for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of nitrogen-containing organic osmolytes have gene expression patterns that indicate a possible role for these 'chemical chaperones' during acclimation to chronic high temperatures and daily temperature cycling. Genes important for the maintenance of membrane integrity are highly responsive to temperature change. Changes in fatty acid saturation may be important in long-term acclimation and in response to fluctuating temperatures; however cholesterol metabolism may be most critical for short-term acclimation to fluctuating temperatures. The variable effect of temperature on the expression of genes with daily rhythms of expression indicates that there is a complex interaction between the temperature cycle and daily rhythmicity in gene expression. A number of new hypotheses concerning temperature acclimation in fish have been generated as a result of this study. The most notable of these hypotheses is the possibility that the high mobility group b1 (HMGB1) protein, which plays key roles in the assembly of transcription initiation and enhanceosome complexes, may act as a compensatory modulator of transcription in response to temperature, and thus as a global gene expression temperature sensor. This study illustrates the utility of cDNA microarray approaches in both hypothesis-driven and 'discovery-based' investigations of environmental effects on organisms.","Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA","Stanford University","Podrabsky, JE (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Dept Biol, POB 751, Portland, OR 97207 USA.","jpod@pdx.edu","Somero, George/AAC-3321-2019","Podrabsky, Jason/0000-0003-1411-8547; Somero, George/0000-0003-1431-6455","","","",NA,"66","330","343","0","81","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

While the role of thermal history in conferring such plasticity is widely documented, its interaction with relative humidity (RH), another important driver of ectotherm survival and activity, is relatively underexplored. Yet the potential responses to these combinational stressors across ontogeny remain largely neglected. Against this background, we used a full-factorial design to test the combined acclimation effects of RH (45%, 65% and 85%) and temperature (23, 28 and 33 degrees C) on various indices of thermal sensitivity of laboratory reared spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) following acclimation beginning at larval, pupal and adult life-stages. Traits measured included critical thermal limits (CTLs), supercooling points (SCPs), chill coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat knockdown time (HKDT). Larval acclimation at 23 degrees C; 85% RH recorded the lowest critical thermal minima (CTmin) whereas adult acclimation at 28 degrees C; 45% RH recorded the highest critical thermal maxima (CTmax. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in SCPs across all temperature x RH acclimations. Larval and pupal acclimations at 23 degrees C; 85% RH and adult acclimation at 23 degrees C; 45% RH significantly improved CCRT. Similarly, commencing acclimation at larval, pupal and adult stages at 28 degrees C; 85% RH improved HKDT whereas larval and pupal acclimations at 33 degrees C; 45% RH impaired it. Our results indicate that combinational interactions of temperature and RH have significant thermal fitness costs and benefits and are dependent on the life-stage acclimation timing. Results also imply that both the vulnerability and adaptive potential of C. partellus populations under rapid climate variability varies with ontogeny. This therefore calls for the consideration of the role of ontogeny and multi-factors in better understanding the impact of environmental stress on ectotherms.","[Mutamiswa, Reyard; Machekano, Honest; Nyamukondiwa, Casper] BIUST, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Sci, Private Bag 16, Palapye, Botswana; [Mutamiswa, Reyard; Chidawanyika, Frank] Univ Free State, Dept Zool & Entomol, POB 339, ZA-9300 Bloemfontein, South Africa","University of the Free State","Nyamukondiwa, C (corresponding author), BIUST, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Sci, Private Bag 16, Palapye, Botswana.","nyamukondiwac@biust.ac.bw","Machekano, Honest/AAL-7848-2020; Chidawanyika, Frank/AAJ-7551-2020","Chidawanyika, Frank/0000-0002-4601-768X; Machekano, Honest/0000-0001-9660-8587","Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST) Research Office grant","Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST) Research Office grant","The study was funded through Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST) Research Office grant.",NA,"79","20","20","6","30","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0306-4565","","","J THERM BIOL","J.

These paradigms together have been largely applied to macro invertebrates and vertebrates but rarely to microorganisms. According to these paradigms, foliar fungal pathogens are expected to respond directly to the fluctuations in leaf temperature, rather than in air temperature. We determined experimentally the impact of two patterns of leaf temperature variation of equal mean temperature, but differing in their daily amplitude, on the development of Zymoseptoria tritici, a fungus infecting wheat leaves. The highest daily thermal amplitude resulted in two detrimental effects for the pathogen fitness: an increase in the length of the latent period, i.e. the 'generation time' of the fungus when infecting its host plant, and a decrease in the density of fruiting bodies on the leaves. We discussed these empirical results, mainly the impact of both the daily thermal amplitude and the fluctuation frequency on the pathogen development in planta, in the light of the mathematical effect of the integration of non-linear functions. We concluded that it is necessary to take into account daily leaf temperature amplitudes to improve our understanding and prediction of the development of foliar fungal pathogens and other micro-organisms living in the phyllosphere in the climate change context.","[Bernard, Frederic; Chelle, Michael; Fortineau, Alain; El Kamel, Ons Riahi] Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, UMR Ecosys, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Bernard, Frederic] ARVALIS Inst Vegetal, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Pincebourde, Sylvain] Univ Tours, Inst Rech Biol Insecte, UMR 7261, CNRS, F-37200 Tours, France; [Sache, Ivan; Suffert, Frederic] Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, AgroParisTech, UMR BIOGER, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France","AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Tours; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","Chelle, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, UMR Ecosys, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.","michael.chelle@inrae.fr","CHELLE, Michaël/AAI-1409-2020; Pincebourde, Sylvain/B-9704-2008","CHELLE, Michaël/0000-0001-8151-1555; Pincebourde, Sylvain/0000-0001-7964-5861","INRAE ('Plant Health and Environment' Division); INRAE ('Environment and Agronomy' Division); ARVALIS - Institut du Vegetal (CIFRE PhD fellowship); French National Research Agency (grant of the 'Investissements d'Avenir' programme; SEPTOVAR project; LabEx BASC) [ANR-11-LABX-0034]","INRAE ('Plant Health and Environment' Division); INRAE ('Environment and Agronomy' Division); ARVALIS - Institut du Vegetal (CIFRE PhD fellowship); French National Research Agency (grant of the 'Investissements d'Avenir' programme; SEPTOVAR project; LabEx BASC)(French National Research Agency (ANR))","We thank Fabrice Duhamel for technical assistance on experiments.

Understanding organismal responses associated with predicted changes are essential for predicting population persistence. Few studies have examined the effects of both increased mean and variance in temperature on organismal traits, particularly during early life stages. Using lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) from Black Lake, MI, we tested whether phenotypic variation differed among families reared in two constant (10 and 18 degrees C) and two fluctuating-temperature treatments (10-19 degrees C) representing temperatures experienced in the river and a simulated anthropogenic disturbance. Body length, body area, and yolk-sac area were quantified at hatch. Family-by-treatment interactions explained up to 50% of the variance observed among families in offspring hatch traits. Families incubated in 18 degrees C and the fluctuating anthropogenic treatment had 6-10 times higher variance in traits than those incubated at 10 degrees C. Hatched larvae were placed in raceways with ambient river water. Emergence body length, emergence timing, and growth were quantified upon emergence. Families differed in time to emergence and growth with the greatest range observed in the 18 degrees C treatment. Results demonstrate that differential responses among genotypes to changes in the mean and variability of thermal incubation regimes can affect traits at hatch as well as a subsequent ontogenetic stage.","[Dammerman, Kari J.; Scribner, Kim T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Dammerman, Kari J.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Columbia River Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, Vancouver, WA 98661 USA; [Steibel, Juan P.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Anim Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Steibel, Juan P.; Scribner, Kim T.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Scribner, Kim T.] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Michigan State University; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University","Dammerman, KJ (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Columbia River Fish & Wildlife Conservat Off, Vancouver, WA 98661 USA.","kari_dammerman@fws.gov","","","Michigan Department of Natural Resources; International Association for Great Lakes Research; Great Lakes Fishery Trust; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service","Michigan Department of Natural Resources; International Association for Great Lakes Research; Great Lakes Fishery Trust; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(US Fish & Wildlife Service)","Funding for this study was provided by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, The International Association for Great Lakes Research, The Great Lakes Fishery Trust, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

To survive in increasingly fluctuating and unpredictable environments, species can either migrate or evolve through rapid local adaptation, plasticity and/or bet-hedging. For small ectotherm insects, like parasitoids and their hosts, phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging could be critical strategies for population and species persistence in response to immediate, intense and unpredictable temperature changes. Here, we focus on studies evaluating phenotypic responses to variable predictable thermal conditions (for which phenotypic plasticity is favoured) and unpredictable thermal environments (for which bet-hedging is favoured), both within and between host and parasitoid generations. We then address the effects of fluctuating temperatures on host-parasitoid interactions, potential cascading effects on the food web, as well as biological control services. We conclude our review by proposing a road map for designing experiments to assess if plasticity and bet-hedging can be adaptive strategies, and to disentangle how fluctuating temperatures can affect the evolution of these two strategies in parasitoids and their hosts.","[Le Lann, Cecile; van Baaren, Joan] Univ Rennes, CNRS, ECOBIO Ecosyst Biodiversite Evolut, UMR 6553, 263 Ave Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Visser, Bertanne] UCLouvain, Evolut & Ecophysiol Grp, Biodivers Res Ctr, Earth & Life Inst, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Rennes 1; Universite Catholique Louvain","Le Lann, C (corresponding author), Univ Rennes, CNRS, ECOBIO Ecosyst Biodiversite Evolut, UMR 6553, 263 Ave Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France.","cecile.lelann@univ-rennes1.fr","","van baaren, joan/0000-0002-8552-9645","UCLouvain, Belgium","UCLouvain, Belgium","We are grateful to Craig Franklin for inviting us to write this Review.

However, many aspects are poorly understood, including fundamental questions relating to the scope and severity of impacts (e.g., demographic consequences at the population level). Plastics accumulate in significant quantities on beaches globally, yet the consequences for these terrestrial environments are largely unknown. Using real world, in situ measurements of circadian thermal fluctuations of beach sediment on Henderson Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands, we demonstrate that plastics increase circadian temperature extremes. Particular plastic levels were associated with increases in daily maximum temperatures of 2.45 degrees C and decreases of daily minimum by - 1.50 degrees C at 5 cm depth below the accumulated plastic. Mass of surface plastic was high on both islands (Henderson: 571 +/- 197 g/m(2); Cocos: 3164 +/- 1989 g/m(2)), but did not affect thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity, or moisture content of beach sediments. Therefore, we suggest plastic effects sediment temperatures by altering thermal inputs and outputs (e.g., infrared radiation absorption). The resulting circadian temperature fluctuations have potentially significant implications for terrestrial ectotherms, many of which have narrow thermal tolerance limits and are functionally important in beach habitats.","[Lavers, Jennifer L.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Battery Point, Tas 7004, Australia; [Rivers-Auty, Jack] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Med, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [Bond, Alexander L.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, Bird Grp, Tring HP23 6AP, Herts, England","University of Tasmania; University of Tasmania; Natural History Museum London","Lavers, JL (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Battery Point, Tas 7004, Australia.","Jennifer.Lavers@utas.edu.au","","","Detached Cultural Organization; Natural History Museum; Howell Conservation Fund; Valpak; Toughsheet Environmental; Pew Trusts; CEFAS; UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Blue Belt Programme); Architectural and Community Planning Inc.; Zoological Society of London; Schwab International; Sea Shepherd Marine Debris; Yuan Fang Media; UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Pitcairn Island Office)","Detached Cultural Organization; Natural History Museum; Howell Conservation Fund; Valpak; Toughsheet Environmental; Pew Trusts; CEFAS; UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Blue Belt Programme); Architectural and Community Planning Inc.; Zoological Society of London; Schwab International; Sea Shepherd Marine Debris; Yuan Fang Media; UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Pitcairn Island Office)","Special thanks to the Cocos and Pitcairn communities (particularly T.

The models were initially expressed in a rate:state form and subsequently integrated resulting in two analytical solutions, representing two distinct types of growth: exponential (Model 1) and asymptotic (Model 2). Both models share the assumptions that growth machinery works at a rate which varies with water temperature and that growth is irreversible. In addition, in Model 1 it is assumed that quantity of growth machinery is proportional to live body weight and substrate is non-limiting over the period of growth; whereas Model 2 is based on the assumption that quantity of growth machinery is proportional to available substrate. Effects of seasonal variations in water temperature on fish growth are represented in both models by a sinusoidal function. The potential of these models was investigated through their ability to describe growth in eight datasets encompassing three species: European bullhead (Cottus gobio), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Models were evaluated using statistical measures of goodness-of-fit and through the analysis of residuals. Of the eight datasets, six displayed asymptotic growth while the other two exhibited exponential growth. Both models yield suitable simple growth functions with acceptable goodness-of-fit to fish growth curves under fluctuating water temperatures. However, Model 1, representing exponential growth, shows limited ability to predict fish size (length) when growth curves follow a clear asymptotic trend. This study enforces the idea that a given model is not always superior to another and that data structure and underlying model assumptions must be considered in model selection.

I examined the acute effects of temperature on the mating behaviour and swimming performance of male eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, which rely on a coercive strategy to obtain matings and are routinely exposed to wide daily temperature fluctuations. Males showed reproductive behaviours across the entire test temperature range of 14-38 degrees C, representing one of the widest reproductively active temperature ranges for any ectotherm. Both the time spent in pursuit of females and the total number of mating attempts increased with temperature to a plateau that started at approximately 22-26 degrees C. However, males maintained a constant level of copulations at 18-34 degrees C, the temperature range they routinely experience in southeast Queensland. In contrast, maximum swimming performance and approach speeds during copulations were highly thermally dependent across this temperature range. Thus, acute temperature variation has important fitness implications for male G. holbrooki, but mating performance was significantly limited only at extreme temperatures.

We also acclimated crickets and fungi to constant or fluctuating conditions. Crickets acclimated to fluctuating conditions survived best under constant conditions if paired with warm-acclimated fungus. Overall, matches and mismatches in thermal performance, driven by acclimation, determined host survival. Mismatched performance also determined differences in survival under different fluctuating thermal regimes: crickets survived best when fluctuating temperatures favored their performance (from 6 degrees to 25 degrees C), compared with fluctuations that favored fungus performance (from 6 degrees to 18 degrees C). Thus, we could predict the outcome of infection under fluctuating temperatures by averaging relative host-pathogen performance under constant temperatures, suggesting that it may be possible to predict responses to fluctuating temperatures for at least some biotic interactions.","[Ferguson, Laura V.; Sinclair, Brent J.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Ferguson, Laura V.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada","Western University (University of Western Ontario); Dalhousie University","Ferguson, LV (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, 1151 Richmond St N, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada.;Ferguson, LV (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B3H 4J1, Canada.","laura.ferguson@dal.ca","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR)","We thank Michael Bidochka for providing the fungus used in this study; Yolanda Morbey for advice on statistical analysis and comments on the manuscript; Graham Thompson, Barb Katzenback, BethMacDougall-Shackleton, Rodney Dekoter, and Kurtis Turnbull for comments on the manuscript; and LaurenDes Marteaux for the cricket drawings.

A negative temperature-size relationship (TSR) is claimed to be one of the universal responses to climatic warming. Studies on extant biota also predicted that groups with narrow latitudinal range, tropical affinity, and higher body size would show higher sensitivity to climatic fluctuation. To confirm the generality of these relationships among marine ectotherms, we compiled the data on body size and global temperature over the Cenozoic using a global database of marine molluscs of Class Gastropoda and Bivalvia. Molluscan species do not show any signature of TSR for any taxonomic, regional, or ecological category during the Cenozoic. We did not find any evidence supporting heightened response in groups with limited latitudinal spread or with large body size. The body-size response of tropical species is not different from those of temperate species. Response of infauna and epifauna does not show any difference either and hence, refutes the predicted variation due to difference in their thermal-specialisation. Our results highlight the limited validity of 'universal rules' in explaining the climate-induced morphological response of marine communities in deep time and underscore the complexity in generalising the biotic outcome of climatic fluctuation.","[Chattopadhyay, Debarati; Chattopadhyay, Devapriya] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER Kolkata, Dept Earth Sci, Mohanpur, Nadia, India","Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Kolkata","Chattopadhyay, D (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res IISER Kolkata, Dept Earth Sci, Mohanpur, Nadia, India.","devapriya@iiserkol.ac.in","Chattopadhyay, Devapriya/I-2498-2019","Chattopadhyay, Devapriya/0000-0002-9102-9313","","","",NA,"82","1","1","0","6","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0891-2963","1029-2381","","HIST BIOL","Hist.

The temperature range experienced by individuals is considered to shape the breadth of the thermal niche, with species occupying temporally and/or geographically stable climates tolerating a narrow temperature range. High-elevation environments experience large temperature fluctuations, with frequent periods below 0 degrees C, but Grylloblatta (Grylloblattodea: Grylloblattidae) occupy climatically stable microhabitats within this region. Here we test critical thermal limits and supercooling points for five Grylloblatta populations from across a large geographic area, to examine whether the stable microhabitats of this group are associated with a narrow thermal niche and assess their capacity to tolerate cold conditions. Thermal limits are highly conserved in Grylloblatta, despite substantial genetic divergence among populations spanning 1500 m elevation and being separated by over 500 km. Further, Grylloblatta show exceptionally narrow thermal limits compared to other insect taxa with little capacity to improve cold tolerance via plasticity. In contrast, upper thermal limits were significantly depressed by cold acclimation. Grylloblatta maintain coordinated movement until they freeze, and they die upon freezing. Convergence of the critical thermal minima, supercooling point and lower lethal limits point to adaptation to a cold but, importantly, constant thermal environment. These physiological data provide an explanation for the high endemism and patchy distribution of Grylloblatta, which relies on subterranean retreats to accommodate narrow thermal limits. These retreats are currently buffered from temperature fluctuations by snow cover, and a declining snow-pack thus places Grylloblatta at risk of exposure to temperatures beyond its tolerance capacity.

Even when the purpose of the study was to investigate effects of temperature, insects have mostly been kept at different but constant temperatures ignoring natural variation in temperature. Here we investigated effects of simple daily temperature fluctuation (22.5/27.5 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C) on some development characteristics in five species of fruit flies (Drosophila) originating from areas with different temperature profiles. We demonstrated how species of the same genus can show substantial differences when developing at fluctuating temperatures not always predictable by development at comparable constant temperature (25 degrees C). Temperature has profound effects on biochemical processes as suggested by the extensive variation in performance of organisms across temperatures. Nonetheless, the use of fluctuating temperature (FT) regimes in laboratory experiments compared to constant temperature (CT) regimes is still mainly applied in studies of model organisms. We investigated how two amplitudes of developmental temperature fluctuation (22.5/27.5 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C, 12/12 h) affected several fitness-related traits in five Drosophila species with markedly different thermal resistance. Egg-to-adult viability did not change much with temperature except in the cold-adapted D. immigrans. Developmental time increased with FT among all species compared to the same mean CT. The impact of FT on wing size was quite diverse among species. Whereas wing size decreased quasi-linearly with CT in all species, there were large qualitative differences with FT. Changes in wing aspect ratio due to FT were large compared to the other traits and presumably a consequence of thermal stress. These results demonstrate that species of the same genus but with different thermal resistance can show substantial differences in responses to fluctuating developmental temperatures not predictable by constant developmental temperatures.

Mortality is higher under constant low temperatures than under a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) that maintains the same low temperature but adds a brief, daily pulse of increased temperature. Long term exposure to FTR has been shown to increase transcription of genes involved in oxidative stress, immune function, and metabolic pathways, which may aid in recovery from chill injury and oxidative damage. Previous research suggests the transcriptional response that protects against sub-lethal damage occurs rapidly under exposure to fluctuating temperatures. However, existing studies have only examined gene expression after a week or over many months. Here we characterize gene expression during a single temperature cycle under FTR. Development of pupating alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata) was interrupted at the red-eye stage and were transferred to 6 degrees C with a 1-h pulse to 20 degrees C and returned to 6 degrees C. RNA was collected before, during, and after the temperature pulse and compared to pupae maintained at a static 6 degrees C. The warm pulse is sufficient to cause expression of transcripts that repair cell membrane damage, modify membrane composition, produce antifreeze proteins, restore ion homeostasis, and respond to oxidative stress. This pattern of expression indicates that even brief exposure to warm temperatures has significant protective effects on insects exposed to stressful cold temperatures that persist beyond the warm pulse. Megachile rotundata's sensitivity to temperature fluctuations indicates that short exposures to temperature changes affect development and physiology. Genes associated with developmental patterning are expressed after the warm pulse, suggesting that 1 h at 20 degrees C was enough to resume development in the pupae. The greatest difference in gene expression occurred between pupae collected after the warm pulse and at constant low temperatures. Although both were collected at the same time and temperature, the transcriptional response to one FTR cycle included multiple transcripts previously identified under long-term FTR exposure associated with recovery from chill injury, indicating that the effects of FTR occur rapidly and are persistent.","[Melicher, Dacotah; Yocum, George D.; Rinehart, Joseph P.] ARS, USDA, Biosci Res Lab, Edward T Schafer Agr Res Ctr, 1616 Albrecht Blvd, Fargo, ND 58102 USA; [Torson, Alex S.; Anderson, Tanner J.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Torson, Alex S.; Bowsher, Julia H.] North Dakota State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 1340 Bolley Dr,218 Stevens Hall, Fargo, ND 58102 USA; [Anderson, Tanner J.] Univ Oregon, Dept Anthropol, 1585 E 13th Ave, Eugene, OR 97403 USA","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Western University (University of Western Ontario); North Dakota State University Fargo; University of Oregon","Melicher, D (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, Biosci Res Lab, Edward T Schafer Agr Res Ctr, 1616 Albrecht Blvd, Fargo, ND 58102 USA.","dacotah.melicher@ars.usda.gov","Torson, Alex/AAV-5215-2020","Torson, Alex/0000-0002-5142-6162; Melicher, Dacotah/0000-0001-8315-669X","United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, National Science Foundation Established Program [NSF-EPSCoR-1826834]; North Dakota State University College of Science and Mathematics; Department of Biological Sciences","United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, National Science Foundation Established Program; North Dakota State University College of Science and Mathematics; Department of Biological Sciences","This work was supported by funding from the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, National Science Foundation Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (NSF-EPSCoR-1826834), the North Dakota State University College of Science and Mathematics and the Department of Biological Sciences.",NA,"69","5","5","0","3","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1540-7063","1557-7023","","INTEGR COMP BIOL","Integr.

Temperature and photoperiod are factors that change in predictable ways. Most studies testing for effects of temperature on vectors use constant temperatures and ignore potential correlated effects of photoperiod. In two experiments, we tested for effects of larval rearing environments creating ecologically relevant temperatures and photoperiods simulating early and late season conditions (June and August), or constant temperatures (cool and warm) with the June or August photoperiods, respectively. We determined effects on survivorship, development, size, and a composite performance index in a temperate-zone population of Aedes triseriatus (Say). We followed cohorts of resulting females, all held under the same environmental conditions, to assess carry-over effects of rearing conditions for larvae on longevity, blood feeding, and egg production. Larval survivorship was affected by treatment in one experiment. Development time was greater in the June and cool treatments, but the constant and fluctuating temperatures did not differ. Significantly larger mosquitoes were produced in fluctuating versus constant temperature treatments. There were no significant treatment effects on the composite performance index. Adult female longevity was lower after rearing at constant versus fluctuating temperature, but there was no difference between June and August, nor did size affect longevity. There was no effect of treatments on blood feeding and a limited effect on egg production. We conclude that seasonal temperatures and photoperiods during development have limited effects on this population of A. triseriatus and find little evidence of strong effects of fluctuating versus constant temperatures.","[Westby, K.

Adaptive phenotypic responses induced by heterogeneous temperatures have been shown to be mediated by molecular pathways independent of the classic heat shock responses; however, an in-depth understanding of plasticity induced by fluctuating temperatures is still lacking. We investigated high and low temperature acclimation induced by fluctuating thermal regimes at two different mean temperatures, at two different amplitudes of fluctuation and across the developmental and adult life stages of Drosophila melanogaster. For developmental acclimation, we found mildly detrimental effects of high-amplitude fluctuations for critical thermal minima, while the critical thermal maxima showed a beneficial response to higher amplitude fluctuations. For adult acclimation involving shifts between fluctuating and constant regimes, cold tolerance was shown to be dictated by developmental temperature conditions irrespective of the adult treatments, while the acquired heat tolerance was readily lost when flies developed at fluctuating temperature were shifted to a constant regime as adults. Interestingly, we also found that the effect of fluctuations at any life stage was gradually lost with prolonged adult maintenance, suggesting a more prominent effect of fluctuations during developmental compared with adult acclimation in D. melanogaster.","[Salachan, Paul Vinu; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov] Aarhus Univ, Sect Genet Ecol & Evolut, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 116,Bldg 1540, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Aarhus University","Salachan, PV (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Sect Genet Ecol & Evolut, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 116,Bldg 1540, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.","paul.salachan@bios.au.dk","Sørensen, Jesper Givskov/J-3190-2013; Salachan, Paul Vinu/K-9517-2019","Sørensen, Jesper Givskov/0000-0002-9149-3626; Salachan, Paul Vinu/0000-0002-8179-5989","Graduate School for Science and Technology (GSST) Screening Grant; Aarhus Universitets Forskningsfond","Graduate School for Science and Technology (GSST) Screening Grant; Aarhus Universitets Forskningsfond","This work was supported by a Graduate School for Science and Technology (GSST) Screening Grant (P.V.S.) and Starting Grant from Aarhus Universitets Forskningsfond (J.G.S.).",NA,"46","17","17","1","29","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

The aim of this research was to study the impact of three daily variable thermal environments (with maximum experimental temperatures between 10:00 and 16:00 hours), on the survival, developmental time and body size of metamorphs of four tropical anuran species from lowland habitats in Colombia. A total of 50 embryos (Gosner stage ten) to metamorphosis (Gosner stage 46) of Rhinella humboldti, Hypsiboas crepitans and Engystomops pustulosus were exposed to each one of the three daily variable temperature treatments: high temperature (mean = 27.5(circle)C; maximum temperature = 34 +/- 1(circle)C; range = 23-35(circle)C), medium temperature (25.5(circle)C; 29 +/- 1(circle)C; 23-30(circle)C), and low temperature (24(circle)C; 24 +/- 1(circle)C; 23-25(circle)C). For the other species, Espadarana prosoblepon, 40 embryos to metamorphosis were exposed to each one of the following thermal treatments: high temperature (mean = 22(circle)C; maximum temperature = 25 +/- 1 C-circle; range = 18-26(circle)C), medium temperature (20.5(circle) C; 22 +/- 1 C-circle; 18-23 C-circle), and low temperature (19 C-circle; 19 +/- 1(circle) C; 18-20 C-circle). For all species, the thermal variable environment with the highest temperature showed the greatest accumulated survival, reduced significantly the developmental time from embryos to metamorphs, and the snout-vent-length of metamorphs. Therefore, under field conditions where ponds are exposed to thermally variable environments, the highest temperatures may promote a decrease in the period of time to metamorphosis, and a positive increase for the anuran survival; nevertheless, extreme temperatures were also found in the microhabitat of the species studied, higher than their upper thermal limits reported, which suggest a vulnerable situation for them and other tropical anurans from similar habitats.","[Bernal-Bautista, Manuel Hernando; Turriago-Gonzalez, Jorge Luis; Villa-Navarro, Francisco Antonio] Univ Tolima, Dept Biol, Calle 42 Barrio Santa Helena, Ibague, Colombia","Universidad del Tolima","Bernal-Bautista, MH (corresponding author), Univ Tolima, Dept Biol, Calle 42 Barrio Santa Helena, Ibague, Colombia.","mhbemal@ut.edu.co; jlturriagog@ut.edu.co; favilla@ut.edu.co","","Bernal, Manuel Hernando/0000-0003-0940-4514","Fondo de Investigaciones de la Universidad del Tolima [370112]","Fondo de Investigaciones de la Universidad del Tolima","This research was supported by Fondo de Investigaciones de la Universidad del Tolima (Project number 370112).

Here, we show for the first time that normal within-daytime fluctuations in temperature of less than 3 degrees C have large effects on personality for two species of juvenile coral reef fish in both observational and manipulative experiments. On average, individual scores on three personality traits (PTs), activity, boldness and aggressiveness, increased from 2.5- to sixfold as a function of temperature. However, whereas most individuals became more active, aggressive and bold across temperature contexts (were plastic), others did not; this changed the individual rank order across temperatures and thus altered personality. In addition, correlations between PTs were consistent across temperature contexts, e. g. fish that were active at a given temperature also tended to be both bold and aggressive. These results (i) highlight the importance of very carefully controlling for temperature when studying behavioural variation among and within individuals and (ii) suggest that individual differences in energy metabolism may contribute to animal personality, given that temperature has large direct effects on metabolic rates in ectotherms.","[Biro, Peter A.] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Beckmann, Christa] Univ Technol Sydney, Inst Water & Environm Resource Management, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia; [Beckmann, Christa] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Stamps, Judy A.] Univ Calif Davis, Sect Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney; University of Sydney; University of California System; University of California Davis","Biro, PA (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Box 123, Broadway, NSW 2007, Australia.","peter.biro@uts.edu.au","Biro, Peter/D-4327-2009; Stamps, Judy A/A-5142-2010; Beckmann, Christa/G-2754-2012","Beckmann, Christa/0000-0002-7904-7228; Biro, Peter/0000-0002-3565-240X","UTS","UTS","Thanks to David Booth for loan of equipment and advice on field sampling at One Tree Island field site, to Mark McCormick for similar advice at Lizard Island and to UTS for financial support.

Variation in T(b) within days (diel), among clays and among different reproductive groups of this viviparous species (pregnant females, non-pregnant females and males) was measured with temperature-sensitive transmitters. We found that surgical implantation of transmitters did not have a significant effect on selected temperature on a laboratory gradient (T(sel)). Field T(b) values were examined in concert with T(sel) and microhabitat temperature in late Summer, revealing marked fluctuations of up to 30 degrees C in T(b) both within and between days. When weather conditions allowed, all reproductive groups exhibited some degree of thermoregulation, with T(b) generally elevated at least 4 degrees C above microhabitat temperature and within the bounds (central 50%) of T(sel) at the warmest times of day on most clays. Considerable thermoregulation occurred early in the day, particularly for pregnant females, and is likely to have involved some degree of direct solar basking.

Shifts in temperature might especially affect amphibians, a group with populations that have been challenged by several pathogens. Because amphibian hosts invest more in immunity at warmer than cooler temperatures and parasites might acclimate to temperature shifts faster than hosts (creating lags in optimal host immunity), researchers have hypothesized that a temperature shift from cold-to-warm might result in increased amphibian sensitivity to pathogens, whereas a shift from warm-to-cold might result in decreased sensitivity. Support for components of this climate-variability based hypothesis have been provided by prior studies of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) that causes the disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians. We experimentally tested whether temperature shifts before exposure to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) alters susceptibility to the disease chytridiomycosis in the larval stage of two amphibian species-western toads (Anaxyrus boreas) and northern red legged frogs (Rana aurora).

Additionally, both species experienced an increase in Bd infection abundance after shifted from 15 degrees C to 20 degrees C, compared to a constant 20 degrees C but they experienced a decrease in Bd after shifted from 20 degrees C to 15 degrees C, compared to a constant 15 degrees C.

Insects, as ectotherm organisms, are strongly dependent on the thermal environment. Yet, little is known about the effects of summer heat and drought on insect diversity. In the Mediterranean climate zone, a region strongly affected by climate change, hot summers might have severe effects on insect communities. Especially the larval stage might be sensitive to thermal variation, as larvae-compared to other life stages-cannot avoid hot temperatures and drought by dormancy. Here we ask, whether inter-annual fluctuations in Mediterranean moth diversity can be explained by temperature (T-Larv) and precipitation during larval development (H-Larv). To address our question, we analyzed moth communities of a Mediterranean coastal forest during the last 20 years. For species with summer-developing larvae, species richness was significantly negatively correlated with T-Larv, while the community composition was affected by both, T-Larv and H-Larv. Therefore, summer-developing larvae seem particularly sensitive to climate change, as hot summers might exceed the larval temperature optima and drought reduces food plant quality. Increasing frequency and severity of temperature and drought extremes due to climate change, therefore, might amplify insect decline in the future.","[Uhl, Britta; Baessler, Claus] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Biol Sci, Inst Ecol Evolut & Divers, Conservat Biol, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany; [Woelfling, Mirko] Bioadvice, D-97464 Niederwerrn, Germany; [Baessler, Claus] Nationalpk Bayer Wald, D-94481 Grafenau, Germany","Goethe University Frankfurt","Uhl, B (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Biol Sci, Inst Ecol Evolut & Divers, Conservat Biol, D-60438 Frankfurt, Germany.","uhl@bio.uni-frankfurt.de","","","Projekt DEAL","Projekt DEAL","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.",NA,"54","0","0","10","10","NATURE PORTFOLIO","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","2045-2322","","","SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","AUG 25","2022","12","1","",NA,"",NA,"","","14473","10.1038/s41598-022-18770-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18770-z","","","10","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","4C1HP","36008549","Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000846214200038","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In the present study, effects of different temperatures ranging from 12 to 40 degrees C on glutamate and succinate mediated mitochondrial respiration, respiratory control ratio (RCR), ATP generation rate, ratio for the utilization of phosphate molecules per atomic oxygen consumption (P/O), levels of lipid peroxidation and H2O2 in isolated gill mitochondria of S. serrata are reported. The pattern of variation in the studied parameters was similar for the two substrates at different temperatures. The values recorded for RCR ( >= 3) and P/O ratio (1.4-2.7) at the temperature range of 15-25 degrees C were within the normal range reported for other animals (3-10 for RCR and 1.5-3 for P/O). Values for P/O ratio, ATP generation rate and RCR were highest at 18 degrees C when compared to the other assay temperatures. However, at low and high extreme temperatures, i.e. at 12 and 40 degrees C, states III and IV respiration rates were not clearly distinguishable from each other indicating that mitochondria were completely uncoupled. Positive correlations were noticed between temperature and the levels of both lipid peroxidation and H2O2. It is inferred that fluctuations on either side of ambient habitat temperature may adversely influence mitochondria respiration and oxidative metabolism in S. serrata.

Using a food web module of two consumers competing for a biotic resource, we investigate how temperature effects on species' attack and mortality rates scale up to population-level outcomes of coexistence and exclusion. We find that differences between species in their competitive effects ultimately arise from asymmetries generated by the nonlinear nature of the temperature response of mortality: cold-adapted species and thermal specialists limit themselves more strongly than they limit their warm-adapted and generalist competitors. These asymmetries become greater as seasonal temperature fluctuations increase, generating latitudinal variation in coexistence patterns and priority effects. Characterizing species' thermal niches in terms of mechanistic descriptions of trait responses to temperature allows us to make testable predictions about the population-level outcomes of competition based solely on three fundamental-and easily measurable-quantities: attack rate optima, response breadths, and temperature sensitivity of mortality. We validate our framework by testing its predictions with data from an insect host-parasitoid community. Simply by quantifying the three basic quantities, we predict that priority effects cannot occur in this system, which is borne out by population-level experiments showing that the outcome of competition does not depend on initial conditions. More broadly, our framework can predict the conditions under which exotic invasive species can exclude or coexist with native biota as well as the effects of climate warming on competitive communities across latitudinal gradients.","[Smith, Daniel J.; Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Smith, Daniel J.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Chicago","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","amarasek@ucla.edu","","","","","",NA,"46","7","7","0","25","UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","CHICAGO","1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","0003-0147","1537-5323","","AM NAT","Am.

Thus, perhaps the commonly asked question whether dinosaurs were ectotherms or endotherms is inappropriate, and it is more constructive to ask which dinosaurs were likely to have been endothermic and which ones ectothermic. Field data from crocodiles over a large size range show that body temperature fluctuations decrease with increasing body mass, and that average daily. body temperatures increase with increasing mass. A biophysical model, the biological relevance of which was tested against field data, was used to predict body temperatures of dinosaurs. However, rather than predicting thermal relations of a hypothetical dinosaur, the model considered correct paleogeographical distribution and climate to predict the thermal relations of a large number of dinosaurs known from the fossil record (>700). Many dinosaurs could have had high (greater than or equal to30degreesC) and stable (daily amplitude less than or equal to2degreesC body temperatures without metabolic heat production even in winter, so it is unlikely that selection pressure would have favored the evolution of elevated resting metabolic rates in those species. Recent evidence of ontogenetic growth rates indicates that even the juveniles of large species (3000-4000 kg) could have had biologically functional body temperature ranges during early development. Smaller dinosaurs (<100 kg) at mid to high latitudes (>45degrees) could not have had high and stable body temperatures without metabolic heat production. However, elevated metabolic rates were unlikely to have provided selective advantage in the absence of some form of insulation, so probably insulation was present before endothermy evolved, or else it coevolved with elevated metabolic rates. Superimposing these findings onto a phylogeny of the Dinosauria suggests that endothermy most likely evolved among the Coelurosauria and, to a lesser extent, among the Hypsilophodontidae, but not among the Stegosauridae, Nodosauridae, Ankylosauridae, Hadrosauridae, Ceratopsidae, Prosauropoda, and Sauropoda.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","University of Sydney","Seebacher, F (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.","fseebach@bio.usyd.edu.au","","Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311","","","",NA,"140","66","71","4","172","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","0094-8373","1938-5331","","PALEOBIOLOGY","Paleobiology","WIN","2003","29","1","",NA,"",NA,"105","122","","10.1666/0094-8373(2003)029<0105:DBTTOO>2.0.CO;2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1666/0094-8373(2003)029<0105:DBTTOO>2.0.CO;2","","","18","Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology","644MN",NA,"","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000180922000016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To survive through varied temperatures, ectotherms have developed unique strategies. This study focuses on synaptic transmission function at cold temperatures, as it is a vital component of ectothermic animals' survival. For determining how synaptic transmission is influenced by an acute change in temperature (20 degrees C to 10 degrees C within a minute) and chronic cold (10 degrees C), the crayfish (Procambarus clarkit) neuromuscular junction (NMJ) was used as a model. To simulate chronic cold conditions, crayfish were acclimated to 15 degrees C for 1 week and then to 10 degrees C for 1 week. They were then used to examine the synaptic properties associated with the low output nerve terminals on the opener muscle in the walking legs and high output innervation on the abdominal deep extensor muscle. The excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of the opener NMJs increased in amplitude with acute warming (20 degrees C) after being acdimated to cold; however, the deep extensor muscles showed varied changes in EPSP amplitude. Synaptic transmission at both NMJs was enhanced with exposure to the modulators serotonin or octopamine. The membrane resistance of the musdes decreased 33% and the resting membrane potential hyperpolarised upon warm exposure. Analysis of haemolymph indicated that octopamine increases during cold exposure. These results suggest bioamine modulation as a possible mechanism for ensuring that synaptic transmission remains functional at low temperatures.","[Zhu, Yuechen; de Castro, Leo; Cooper, Robin Lewis] Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [de Castro, Leo] MIT, EECS, 50 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","University of Kentucky; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)","Cooper, RL (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Biol, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.","rlcoop1@uky.edu","","","","","",NA,"100","5","5","1","9","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","2046-6390","","","BIOL OPEN","Biol.

This pattern, known as the temperature-size rule, is often accompanied by plastic changes in cell size, which can mechanistically explain the thermal dependence of body size. However, the theory predicts that thermal plasticity in cell size has adaptive value for ectotherms because there are different optimal cell-membrane-to-cell-volume ratios at different temperatures. At high temperatures, the demand for oxygen is high; therefore, a large membrane surface of small cells is beneficial because it allows high rates of oxygen transport into the cell. The metabolic costs of maintaining membranes become more important at low temperatures than at high temperatures, which favours large cells. In a field experiment, we manipulated the thermal conditions inside nests of the red mason bee, a solitary bee that does not regulate the temperature in its nests and whose larvae develop under ambient conditions. We assessed the effect of temperature on body mass and ommatidia size (our proxy of cell size). The body and cell sizes decreased in response to a higher mean temperature and greater temperature fluctuations. This finding is in accordance with predictions of the temperature-size rule and optimal cell size theory and suggests that both the mean temperature and the magnitude of temperature fluctuations are important for determining body and cell sizes. Additionally, we observed that males of the red mason bee tend to have larger ommatidia in relation to their body mass than females, which might play an important role during mating flight.","[Kierat, Justyna; Czarnoleski, Marcin; Woyciechowski, Michal] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland; [Szentgyorgyi, Hajnalka] Univ Agr, Dept Pomol & Apiculture, Krakow, Poland","Jagiellonian University; Agricultural University Krakow","Kierat, J (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Krakow, Poland.","justyna.kierat@doctoral.uj.edu.pl; hajnalka.szentgyorgyi@gmail.com; marcin.czarnoleski@uj.edu.pl; michal.woyciechowski@uj.edu.pl","Czarnoleski, Marcin/H-2893-2015; Szentgyörgyi, Hajnalka/AAK-2579-2020","Czarnoleski, Marcin/0000-0003-2645-0360; Szentgyörgyi, Hajnalka/0000-0002-5753-800X; Kierat, Justyna/0000-0003-4534-095X","Jagiellonian University [DS/BINOZ/INOS/757/13-16, DS/BINOZ/INOS/761/13-16]; Polish National Science Centre [DEC-2013/11/N/NZ8/00930]","Jagiellonian University; Polish National Science Centre","We thank P.

We hypothesize that burrow-creating organisms may facilitate climate change adaptation by providing refugia from extreme and fluctuating temperatures found aboveground. We support this hypothesis by showing that large burrow-dwelling tortoises, Gopherus polyphemus, likely depend upon burrows for thermoregulation. By exploiting the varied thermal conditions within burrows, tortoises avoided lethal temperatures and extreme fluctuations in body temperature, maintained moderate and stable body temperatures on hot days, and maintained relatively warm temperatures overnight. Climate change is predicted to increase maximum air temperatures throughout the geographic range of this species, with impacts most severe in Florida, US, where the range of future conditions could be above that of current maxima. This implies that environmental temperatures will be above lethal thermal limits more often, highlighting the importance of refugia from extreme conditions. Large burrowing animals (e.g. aardvarks, pocket gophers, rabbits, seabirds, tortoises, wombats) are widely distributed globally and could provide similar thermal refugia for countless commensal taxa. Burrows and the animals that create them are in urgent need of conservation, which will help ensure the widespread availability of refugia that offer protection from extreme temperatures under climate change.","[Pike, D.

At lower T-b, pulse interval (PI) increases and diastolic pressure decays for longer, possibly resulting in lower end-diastolic pressures and mean arterial pressures (P-m). Additionally, compensatory baroreflex-related heart rate modulation (i.e. the cardiac branch of the baroreflex response) is delayed due to increased PI. Thus, low T-b is potentially detrimental, leading to cardiovascular malfunctioning. This raises the question on how P-m is regulated in such an adverse condition. We investigated the baroreflex compensations that enables tegu lizards, Salvator merianae, to maintain blood pressure homeostasis in a wide T-b range. Lizards had their femoral artery cannulated and pressure signals recorded at 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C. We used the sequence method to analyse the heart rate baroreflex-related corrections to spontaneous pressure fluctuations at each temperature. Vascular adjustments (i.e. the peripheral branch) were assessed by calculating the time constant for arterial pressure decay (tau)-resultant from the action of both vascular resistance and compliance-by fitting the diastolic pressure descent to the two-element Windkessel equation. We observed that at lower T-b, lizards increased baroreflex gain at the operating point (G(op)) and tau, indicating that the diastolic pressure decays at a slower rate. G(op) normalized to P-m and PI, as well as the ratio tau/PI, did not change, indicating that both baroreflex gain and rate of pressure decay are adjusted according to PI lengthening. Consequently, pressure parameters and the oscillatory power fraction (an index of wasted cardiac energy) were unaltered by T-b, indicating that both G(op) and tau modulation are crucial for cardiovascular homeostasis.","[Filogonio, Renato; Orsolini, Karina F.; Oda, Gustavo M.; Leite, Cleo A.

The thermal performance curve (TPC), which quantifies the thermal sensitivity of traits such as metabolism, growth and feeding rates in laboratory conditions, is often used to predict responses of wild populations. However, central assumptions of this approach are that TPCs are relatively static between populations and that curves measured under stable temperature conditions can predict performance under variable conditions. We test these assumptions using two latitudinally matched populations of the ecosystem engineer Mytilus trossulus that differ in their experienced temperature variability regime. We acclimated each population in a range of constant or fluctuating temperatures for six weeks and measured a series of both short term (feeding rate, byssal thread production) and long-term (growth, survival) metrics to test the hypothesis that performance in fluctuating temperatures can be predicted from constant temperatures. We find that this was not true for any metric, and that there were important interactions with the population of origin. Our results emphasize that responses to fluctuating conditions are still poorly understood and suggest caution must be taken in the use of TPCs generated under constant temperature conditions for the prediction of wild population responses.","[Marshall, Katie E.; Anderson, Kathryn M.; Konecny, Cassandra A.; Harley, Christopher D.

Ectotherm performance can be maintained in thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed to either stable (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C) or variable (narrowly variable: 13-17 degrees C day(-1) or widely variable 11-21 degrees C day(-1)) thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, % body mass gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed, U-crit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments, suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a plastic response in swimming performance, where U-crit was insensitive to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal breadth. Maximum U-crit attained was similar among thermoperiod treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures (stable: 4.62 +/- 0.44 BL s(-1) at 15 degrees C; narrowly variable: 4.52 +/- 0.23 BL s(-1) at 21 degrees C; widely variable: 3.90 +/- 0.24 BL s(-1) at 11 degrees C, mean +/- s.e.m.). In combination, these findings suggest juvenile A. medirostris are resilient to daily fluctuations in temperature, within the temperature range tested here.","[Rodgers, Essie M.; Cocherell, Dennis E.; Nguyen, Trinh X.; Fangue, Nann A.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Todgham, Anne E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anim Sci, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Rodgers, Essie M.] Univ Antwerp, Dept Biol, Syst Physiol & Ecotoxicol Res, Groenenborgerlaan 171, BE-2020 Antwerp, Belgium","University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Antwerp","Fangue, NA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Wildlife Fish & Conservat Biol, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","nafangue@ucdavis.edu","","Rodgers, Essie/0000-0003-3514-3653","University of California, Davis Agricultural Experiment Station [2098-H, 2252-H]; Delta Stewardship Council [1470]","University of California, Davis Agricultural Experiment Station(University of California System); Delta Stewardship Council","This work was supported by the University of California, Davis Agricultural Experiment Station (grant #2098-H and grant #2252-H) and the Delta Stewardship Council (grant # 1470).

We simulated fluctuating temperatures and examined how this affects the operational sex ratio (OSR) of hatching as well as nymph and adult fitness in a leafhopper, Scaphoideus titanus. Specifically, after a warm or cold incubation we compared males and females hatching dynamics with their consequences on the sex ratio in the course of time, body size, weight, and developmental rate of the two populations, all reared on the same posthatching temperature. Males and females eggs respond differently, with females more sensitive to variation in incubation temperature. The different responses of both sexes have consequences on the sex ratio dynamic of hatchings with a weaker protandry after warm incubation. Temperatures experienced by eggs have more complex consequences on posthatching development. Later nymphal instars that hatched from eggs exposed to warm temperature were larger and bigger but developmental rate of the two populations was not affected. Our study demonstrates how incubation temperature could affect operational sex ratio and posthatching development in an insect and how this may be critical for population growth.","[Chuche, Julien; Thiery, Denis] Inst Sci Vigne & Vin, INRA, INRA ENITAB UMR Save Sante & Agroecol Vignoble 10, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France","INRAE","Thiery, D (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Save 1065, 71 Ave E Bourleaux, F-33881 Villenave Dornon, France.","thiery@bordeaux.inra.fr","Chuche, Julien/B-6636-2009","Chuche, Julien/0000-0002-1547-7587","Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bordeaux; Region Aquitaine; INRA SPE","Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bordeaux; Region Aquitaine(Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine); INRA SPE","We thank Drs A.

Reaction norms depict the environmental effects on phenotypic traits and are used to predict the global change consequences on species distributions. However, studies performed at constant temperatures have limited ecological significance because expressed phenotypes depend on the range and frequency of environmental states. 2. Using Jensen's inequality (i.e. a mathematical property of nonlinear functions), we predicted that the effect of thermal fluctuations on the phenotype depends on the shape of the reaction norm. Thermal fluctuations around the optimal temperature are expected to reduce the phenotypic trait values, especially for specialists because of their narrower reaction norms. 3. This study measured the effects of diel fluctuations in developmental temperature on phenotypic expression of traits related to fitness and energetic resources in two strains of the parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens from different habitats: a thermal generalist strain and a specialist one. In a first experiment, we compared the effect of constant thermal regimes versus fluctuating ones having the same means (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) on reaction norms of life-history traits and of energetic reserves. In a second experiment, we examined the effects of a natural thermoperiod in the field on these traits. 4. Our results show that the shape of the reaction norm defines the phenotypic changes induced by the development under fluctuating thermal conditions. These results match the predictions of the Jensen's inequality. Moreover, our results emphasize the significance of taking into account several phenotypic life-history traits to study the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity. We also show that the level of energetic resources depends on the mean developmental temperature and not on the thermal regime. Finally, the field experiment confirms that the phenotype of these parasitoids depends on the temperature variation. 5. Our study highlights the relevance of the Jensen's inequality to predict the effect of thermal fluctuations on fitness of parasitoids with contrasted thermal sensitivities.","[Foray, Vincent; Desouhant, Emmanuel; Gibert, Patricia] Univ Lyon, F-69000 Lyon, France; [Foray, Vincent; Desouhant, Emmanuel; Gibert, Patricia] Univ Lyon 1, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Foray, Vincent; Desouhant, Emmanuel; Gibert, Patricia] CNRS, UMR5558, Lab Biometrie & Biol Evolut, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France","UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); VetAgro Sup","Foray, V (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Biodivers Res Ctr, Croix Sud 4-5 Bte L7-07-04, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.","vincent.foray@uclouvain.be","DESOUHANT, Emmanuel/A-9537-2013; Foray, Vincent/J-3095-2019","DESOUHANT, Emmanuel/0000-0003-0317-4463; Gibert, Patricia/0000-0002-9461-6820; Foray, Vincent/0000-0002-1561-1934","Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche","Ministere de l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche(Estonian Research CouncilEuropean Commission)","We are grateful to Sandrine Sauzet and Francois Debias for their help in rearing.

However, little is known about the variation in cold tolerance of marine invertebrates among local populations of the same species. In this study, three experiments were conducted to demonstrate inter-population variation in the cold tolerance of the intertidal gastropod Littorina brevicula, and to explore factors driving the variation. First, seasonal changes in the freezing temperature (the supercooling point, SCP) and the median lower lethal temperature (LLT50) of snails collected from a single population were examined to identify the cold tolerance strategies of this species. Seasonal fluctuation was clear in only the LLT50 which was lower than the SCP in winter, indicating that cold tolerance strategy of this species was freeze tolerant. Second, the cold tolerance of snails from four populations was compared. These populations were distributed at latitudinally different locations, and the comparisons were performed before winter when their cold tolerance was not required and in winter when their cold tolerance increased. In this experiment, while the cold tolerance of snails collected in winter was higher than that of snails collected before winter in all four populations, there were differences in tolerance among the populations. Furthermore, to estimate their ability of acclimation to cold environments, snails that were collected from the northernmost and southernmost populations in the four populations before winter were acclimated to a constant low temperature in the laboratory for a long period (120-130 days). This long period of acclimation led to an increase in the cold tolerance of both populations, but the latitudinal difference was maintained. Additionally, after imposing the long period of acclimation to snails that were collected at 12 locations before winter, factors that might cause local variation in their cold tolerance were explored. This experiment clearly showed that local variation in cold tolerance was explained by the lowest local air temperature. Our study demonstrated inter population variation in the cold tolerance of an intertidal mollusc, and that the variation is explained by thermal gradients in winter. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Many organisms respond to seasonal temperature fluctuations by the reversible modification of whole-animal performance. Semiaquatic ectotherms, which possess this acclimatory capacity in swimming speed, lack the plastic response in terrestrial locomotor performance and vice versa. Theory predicts that the presence of reversible (seasonal) thermal acclimation or fixed phenotypes depends on the predictability of future thermal conditions (i.e. accuracy of temperature cues) in a given environment. Alternatively, comparative data suggest that thermal acclimation is induced by disparate temperature cues in water and on land. 2. We tested both predictions by examining the seasonal acclimation response in thermal sensitivity of maximal swimming and running speed in adult alpine newts, Ichthyosaura (formerly Triturus) alpestris. 3. Following the seasonal variation in environmental temperatures, we exposed newts to 5 degrees C from November to March and, after a gradual temperature increase, to either a constant (15 degrees C) or fluctuating (10-20 degrees C) thermal regime from May to June. At the end of each treatment, we measured newt swimming and running capacity at five temperatures (range 5-25 degrees C). In the field, hourly temperatures were recorded in various aquatic and terrestrial microhabitats to obtain information about the predictability of thermal conditions in both environments. 4. Seasonal acclimation shaped the thermal sensitivity of swimming speed under both constant and fluctuating temperature treatments. Thermal sensitivity of running speed was markedly modified by a fluctuating thermal regime so that newts ran at the highest test temperature faster than cold-acclimated individuals. Natural thermal environment contained a similar proportion of predictable variation in water and on land. 5. Complex seasonal acclimation of locomotor capacity in newts was influenced by the disparate thermal cues, i.e. mean acclimation temperature or diel temperature fluctuations, rather than by the different accuracy of these cues in water and on land. Future confrontations of theory with empirical data will require more attention not only on the assumptions of adaptive thermal acclimation but also on the ecologically relevant thermal conditions during acclimation experiments.","[Samajova, Pavlina; Gvozdik, Lumir] Inst Vertebrate Biol AS CR, Dept Populat Biol, Konesin 67502, Czech Republic","Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Biology of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Gvozdik, L (corresponding author), Inst Vertebrate Biol AS CR, Dept Populat Biol, Studenec 122, Konesin 67502, Czech Republic.","gvozdik@brno.cas.cz","Gvoždík, Lumír/G-1178-2014; ASCR, IVB/A-9883-2011","Gvoždík, Lumír/0000-0002-6495-2233; ","Czech Science Foundation [206/06/0953]; Czech Ministry of Education [LC06073]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Czech Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","We thank two anonymous reviewers and M.J.

Studies that examine effects on embryos rarely assess the potential for thermal tolerance to change with ontogeny or how effects differ among sympatric species, and often utilize unrealistic temperature treatments. We used thermal fluctuations from nests within the urbanheat island to determine how thermal tolerance of embryos changes across development and differs among two sympatric lizard species (Antis sagrei and Antis cristatefius). We applied fluctuations that varied in frequency and magnitude at different times during development and measured effects on embryo physiology and survival, and hatchling morphology, growth and survival. Thermal tolerance differed between the species by similar to 2 degrees C: embryos of A. sagrei, a lizard that prefers warmer, open-canopy microhabitats, were more robust to thermal stress than embryos of A. cristatellus, which prefers cooler, closed-canopy microhabitats. Moreover, thermal tolerance changed through development; however, the nature of this change differed between the species. For A. cristatellus, thermal tolerance was greatest mid-development. For A. sagrei, the relationship was not statistically clear. The greatest effects of thermal stress were on embryo and hatchling survival and embryo physiology. Hatchling morphology and growth were less affected. Inter-specific responses and the timing of stochastic thermal events with respect to development have important effects on embryo mortality. Thus, research that integrates ecologically meaningful thermal treatments, considers multiple life-history stages and examines interspecific responses will be critical to make robust predictions of the impacts of global change on wildlife.","[Hall, Joshua M.; Warner, Daniel A.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 101 Rouse Life Sci Bldg, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Auburn University System; Auburn University","Hall, JM (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 101 Rouse Life Sci Bldg, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.","jmh0131@auburn.edu","Hall, Joshua/AAP-7302-2020","Hall, Joshua/0000-0002-5587-3402; Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785","National Science Foundation [DEB-1564563]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (DEB-1564563).",NA,"56","15","15","0","15","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

Many pesticides are indeed more toxic at higher mean temperatures. Yet, we know next to nothing about the effect of another key component of climate change, the increase of daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs), on pesticide toxicity. Therefore, we tested the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos under different levels of DTF (constant = 0 degrees C, low = 5 degrees C (current maximum level) and high = 10 degrees C (predicted maximum level under global warming)) around the same mean temperature on key life history and physiological traits of Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae in a common-garden experiment. At all levels of DTF, chlorpyrifos exposure was stressful: it reduced energy storage (fat content) and the activity of its target enzyme acetylcholinesterase, while it increased the activity of the detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Notably, chlorpyrifos did not cause mortality or reduced growth rate at the constant temperature (0 degrees C DTF), yet increased mortality 6x and reduced growth rate with ca. 115% in the presence of DTF. This indicates that daily short-term exposures to higher temperatures can increase pesticide toxicity. Our data suggest that when 5 degrees C DTF will become more common in the studied high-latitude populations, this will increase the toxicity of CPF, and that a further increase from 5 degrees DTF to 10 degrees C DTF may not result in a further increase of pesticide toxicity. Our results highlight the biological importance of including daily temperature fluctuations in ecological risk assessment of pesticides and as an extra dimension in the climate-induced toxicant sensitivity concept.

However, many aquatic ectothermic species maintain coordinated sensorimotor function during large acute body-temperature changes, which points to a compensatory mechanism within the neural system. Here we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging to study brain responses to a drop of 10 degrees C of ambient water temperature in common carp. We observed a strong drainage of blood out of the brain as of 90 s after the onset of the temperature drop, which would be expected to reduce entry of cold blood arriving from the gills so that the change in brain temperature would be slower. Although oxygen content in the brain thus decreased, we still found specific activation in the preoptic area ( involved in temperature detection and stress responses), the pituitary pars distalis ( stress response), and inactivation of the anterior part of the midbrain tegmentum and the pituitary pars intermedia. We propose that the blood drainage from the brain slows down the cooling of the brain during an acute temperature drop. This could help to maintain proper brain functioning including sensorimotor activity, initiation of the stress response, and the subsequent behavioral responses.","Univ Antwerp, Bioimaging Lab, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; Univ Nijmegen, Fac Sci, Dept Anim Physiol, Nijmegen, Netherlands","University of Antwerp; Radboud University Nijmegen","Van der Linden, A (corresponding author), Univ Antwerp, Bioimaging Lab, Campus Middelheim,Groenenborgerlaan 171, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium.","Annemie.VanderLinden@ua.ac.be","Flik, Gert/C-8229-2011; Van der Linden, Annemie/L-7855-2017","Flik, Gert/0000-0001-9285-7957; Van der Linden, Annemie/0000-0003-2941-6520; Verhoye, Marleen/0000-0002-6267-0611","","","",NA,"37","48","49","5","34","AMER PHYSIOLOGICAL SOC","BETHESDA","9650 ROCKVILLE PIKE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0022-3077","1522-1598","","J NEUROPHYSIOL","J.

We examined correlations between local climatic conditions, body temperature and activity in adult, basking lowland copperheads (Austrelaps superbus) from two localities (warm-temperate versus cool-temperate) in south-eastern Australia. We also collected data from highland copperheads (Austrelaps ramsayi) at a locality with cold-temperate climate. We found that across the active season, mean body temperatures were similar among localities (approximately 27 degreesC) irrespective of species. In contrast, activity times differed. Cool-temperate A. superbus emerged earlier in spring and in the morning and retreated earlier in the evening and in autumn than their conspecifics from the warm-temperate locality. Spring emergence was correlated with yearly fluctuations in thermal conditions, suggesting that activity times depend on environmental temperatures. Predator-prey interactions influenced body temperature and activity to some extent in spring when warm-temperate A. superbus with relatively low body temperatures (as low as 18.5 degreesC) were captured around ponds in which they had been foraging for frogs. Austrelaps ramsayi from the cold-temperate locality not only displayed a later emergence in spring and reduced daily activity times compared with warm and cool-temperate A. superbus but also compared with A. ramsayi, as reported from a warmer locality in eastern Australia. These data indicate that activity times vary on a geographic basis while snake body temperatures largely remain inflexible. The surprising exception was that cold-temperate A. ramsayi retreated later in autumn than cool-temperate A. superbus, and at that time they showed body temperatures as low as 12.5 degreesC, well below those we had recorded for A. superbus. We suggest that A. ramsayi retreat later in autumn because they need to extend their reproductive season and that this is mediated via adaptive changes in the critical minimum body temperature, as has been reported for other snakes.","La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Bundoora, Vic 3083, Australia","La Trobe University","Rohr, DH (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Dept Appl & Environm Sci, GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.","","","Rohr, Detlef/0000-0001-9780-2410","","","",NA,"53","7","7","0","22","CSIRO PUBLISHING","CLAYTON","UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA","0004-959X","1446-5698","","AUST J ZOOL","Aust.

Year-round SR measurements are however expensive and sometimes impossible to perform. Bahn et al. (2010) developed an approach to estimate annual SR (SRannual) from the flux measured at mean soil temperature (SRMAST), but the robustness of this approach needs to be evaluated in diverse ecosystem types and climatic conditions globally. We used a global soil respiration database (SRDB-V4, with 823 SR observations worldwide) to test the capability of SRMAST to predict SRannual. SRMAST estimated using a variety of methods all showed clear relationships with annual SRannual Two single-rate methods (i.e., using the single SR rate closest to mean annual soil temperature, or the single SR rate closest to mean annual air temperature) showed the most pronounced divergence from the true SRannual, but errors significantly decreased when using multiple SR rates within 1 degrees C of the mean annual soil temperature to estimate SRMAST. SRannual was most closely correlated with SRMAST estimated via a Q 10 relationship, but this method has a potential autocorrelation issue that we explore and discuss. Air temperature data are much more widely available than is soil temperature, and we found that SR at mean annual air temperature (SRMAAT) can be used to predict SRannual as well. This study builds on Bahn et al. (2010) to demonstrate that SR measured at both annual mean soil and air temperature can be used to predict annual SR, with well-quantified errors. This capability could be used to reduce SR measurement frequency required for estimating SRannual and greatly decrease cost, factors that are generally important but especially in lower-income countries and cold, inaccessible regions.","[Jian, Jinshi; Bond-Lamberty, Ben] Univ Maryland, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Bahn, Michael] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Ecol, Sternwartestr 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Wang, Chuankuan] Northeast Forestry Univ, Ctr Ecol Res, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chuankuan] Northeast Forestry Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Sustainable Forest Ecosyst Management, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China; [Bailey, Vanessa L.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Biol Sci Div, Richland, WA 99354 USA","United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Innsbruck; Northeast Forestry University - China; Northeast Forestry University - China; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Jian, JS (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, 5825 Univ Res Court,Suite 3500, College Pk, MD 20740 USA.","jinshi@vt.edu","Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/C-6058-2008; Bahn, Michael/I-3536-2013","Bond-Lamberty, Benjamin/0000-0001-9525-4633; Bahn, Michael/0000-0001-7482-9776; Jian, Jinshi/0000-0002-5272-5367; wang, chuan kuan/0000-0003-3513-5426","DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), as part of BER's Terrestrial Ecosystem Science Program [DE-AC05-76RL01830]","DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), as part of BER's Terrestrial Ecosystem Science Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was supported by the DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), as part of BER's Terrestrial Ecosystem Science Program [grand number: DE-AC05-76RL01830].

Our objective was to compare the thermal tolerances of stream fishes of different habitat guilds among 3 exposure periods: critical thermal maximum (CTmax, increase of 2 degrees C/h until loss of equilibrium [LOE] and death [D]), and 2 longer-term treatments (net daily increase of 1 degrees C) that mimicked spring-fed (SF; 4 degrees C daily increase) and non-spring-fed (NSF; 8 degrees C daily increase) conditions. Fishes in the pelagic habitat guild had a 1 degrees C higher average CTmax than benthic fishes. Thermal responses of species depended on exposure period with higher and increased variation in tolerances associated with the SF and NSF exposure periods. Logperch, Orangebelly Darter, Orangethroat Darter, and Southern Redbelly Dace were more sensitive to thermal increases regardless of SF or NSF treatment than were the 3 remaining species (Brook Silverside, Central Stoneroller, and Redspot Chub), which represented average thermal responses among the species tested. The 3 species that had a higher thermal response to CTmax-D (lethal endpoint of death) also were able to increase their tolerances more than other species in both SF and NSF treatments. Our data indicate finer guild designations may be useful for predicting thermal-response patterns. A diel thermal refuge increases the thermal responses of ectotherms to daily maxima, but the patterns across our SF and NSF treatments were similar suggesting minimum refuge temperatures may be more important than maximums. Nonetheless, stream temperature cooling over a 24-h period is important to ectotherm thermal tolerances, a result suggesting that sources of cooler water to streams might benefit from protection.","[Farless, Nicole A.] Oklahoma State Univ, Oklahoma Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 007 Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Brewer, Shannon K.] Oklahoma State Univ, US Geol Survey, Oklahoma Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 007 Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey","Farless, NA (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Oklahoma Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 007 Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.","nicole.farless@okstate.edu; shannon.brewer@okstate.edu","","","Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; Oklahoma State University [AG1313]","Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit; Oklahoma State University","This research is a contribution of the Oklahoma Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (USGS, Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, Oklahoma State University, and Wildlife Management Institute cooperating).

One example is the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which has led to widespread amphibian population declines. Understanding its thermal ecology is essential to effectively predict outbreaks. Studies that examine the impact of temperature on hosts and pathogens often do so in controlled constant temperatures. Although varying temperature experiments are becoming increasingly common, it is unrealistic to test every temperature scenario. Thus, reliable methods that use constant temperature data to predict performance in varying temperatures are needed. In this study, we tested whether we could accurately predict Bd growth in three varying temperature regimes, using a Bayesian hierarchical model fit with constant temperature Bd growth data. We fit the Bayesian hierarchical model five times, each time changing the thermal performance curve (TPC) used to constrain the logistic growth rate to determine how TPCs influence the predictions. We then validated the model predictions using Bd growth data collected from the three tested varying temperature regimes. Although all TPCs overpredicted Bd growth in the varying temperature regimes, some functional forms performed better than others.

They entail potential physiological constraints for organisms' performance, which can lead to activity restrictions and impact fitness and demography. Reptiles are ectotherms which rely on seasonal periodicity to maximize the performance of biological functions. Despite it, the ecological implications of shifts in local temperatures are barely explored at the seasonal scale. This study aims to assess how changes in air temperature and substrate temperature affect the activity, body temperature (T-b) and thermoregulation patterns of the sand lizard, Liolaemus arambarensis (an endangered, microendemic species from southern Brazil), throughout a four-year period. Field surveys were conducted monthly on a restricted population in a sand-dune habitat. The annual fluctuations of the seasonal temperatures led to significant changes in the activity and T-b of L. arambarensis and shaped thermoregulation trends, suggesting biological plasticity as a key factor in the face of such variability. Lizards tended to maintain seasonal T-b in mild and harsh seasons through increased warming/cooling efforts. Anomalous winter conditions seemed especially critical for individual performance due to their apparent high impact favouring/constraining activity. Activity and thermoregulation were inhibited in frigid winters, probably due to a vulnerable physiology to intense cold spells determined by higher preferred body temperatures than T-b. Our results warn of a complex sensitivity in lizards to anomalous seasonal temperatures, which are potentially enhanced by climate change. The current work highlights the importance of multiannual biomonitoring to disentangle long-term responses in the thermal biology of reptiles and, thereby, to integrate conservation needs in the scope of global change.","[Liz, Andre Vicente; Santos, Vinicius; Guimaraes, Murilo; Verrastro, Laura] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Dept Zool, Inst Biociencias, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Ribeiro, Talita] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Ecol, Dept Ecol, Inst Biociencias, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Liz, Andre Vicente] Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Vairao, Portugal","Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade do Porto","Liz, AV (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Dept Zool, Inst Biociencias, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.;Liz, AV (corresponding author), Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO, Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Vairao, Portugal.","andre.vicente.liz@cibio.up.pt","Liz, André Vicente/Q-7174-2018; Verrastro, Laura/I-3243-2012; VICENTE, LIERN/B-6112-2008","Liz, André Vicente/0000-0001-6131-5194; Verrastro, Laura/0000-0002-3094-8906; VICENTE, LIERN/0000-0001-5883-9640; Inacio Monteiro dos Santos, Vinicius/0000-0002-1931-8022","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil [001]; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - Postgraduate program in Animal Biology; European Commission through the program Erasmus Mundus Master Course - International Master in Applied Ecology; Celulose Riograndense","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - Postgraduate program in Animal Biology; European Commission through the program Erasmus Mundus Master Course - International Master in Applied Ecology; Celulose Riograndense","This work was supported by research fellowships from the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brazil (http://www.capes.gov.br / Postgraduate scholarship - AVL; and Postdoctoral scholarship - MG; financial code 001).

Variation in body size among related species could also be attributable in part to temperature if the different species grow under different thermal regimes. The roles of both initial (larval) size and host body temperature on final (adult) size of parasitic trematodes were investigated in a comparative analysis. Trematodes are a good model group for such a study, with almost half of known species growing at high and constant temperatures in endothermic vertebrates and the rest at lower and fluctuating temperatures in ectothermic vertebrates. The relative growth of trematodes, i.e., their growth relative to the size of their larvae, varied greatly among species. Increases in body size from the cercarial larval stage to the adult stage averaged almost 40-fold (maximum 1300-fold), whereas increases in size from the metacercarial stage to the adult stage averaged 6-fold (maximum 110-fold). There were no differences between trematodes in ectothermic hosts and trematodes in endothermic hosts with respect to these measures of relative growth, however, which suggests that host type and the thermal regime provided by the host have no effect on the growth of trematodes from larval to adult stages. In contrast, the final (adult) body size of trematodes appears to be determined to some extent by their initial (larval) size, independently of the type of host in which they developed.","Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand; Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","University of Otago; University of Alberta","Poulin, R (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Zool, POB 56, Dunedin, New Zealand.","robert.poulin@stonebow.otago.ac.nz","Poulin, Robert/C-3117-2008; Poulin, Robert/GQO-8936-2022","Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206; Poulin, Robert/0000-0003-1390-1206","","","",NA,"28","31","33","0","10","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING","OTTAWA","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA","0008-4301","1480-3283","","CAN J ZOOL","Can.

Temperature varies significantly, and often unpredictably, in their habitat throughout the spring breeding season, and is known to influence male Schizocosa courtship behavior. Currently unknown is what effect fluctuations in ambient temperature alone might have on critical, non-behavioral sexual signals such as female silk and chemical cues. We collected cues from mature, virgin females and subjected each sample to one of three thermal treatments (40 degrees C, 20 degrees C, or -12 degrees C), at constant humidity. We presented treated female cues to mature males and recorded male response across treatment types as a behavioral indicator of signal degradation. There were no significant differences across treatments in the frequency or duration of male behaviors, including critical courtship and exploratory behaviors. Our results suggest that thermally induced degradation of female sexual signals is negligible for this species and likely has little or no influence on male behavior.","[Campbell, Melissa] Ohio State Univ, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Roberts, J.

However, for short-lived insects daily fluctuations of temperature could be an important environmental parameter involved in evolutionary adaptation to thermal heterogeneity. In this study we investigated the mechanisms underlying evolutionary adaptation to daily fluctuating temperatures. We studied replicated selection lines of Drosophila simulans evolved in a constant or a daily fluctuating thermal regime. Previous studies of these lines have shown clear acclimation benefits to heat tolerance induced by the fluctuating regime. First, we tested the existence of an evolved circadian controlled adjustment of heat resistance in selected flies. This was done by investigating the daily variation in time to heat knockdown in flies from both selection regimes when exposed to either a constant or a daily fluctuating thermal regime for a single generation. While daily variation in heat resistance was found, the results suggest that there was neither an evolved adaptive circadian controlled adjustment of heat resistance nor a continuous acclimation response induced by fluctuating temperatures in these lines. Second, in order to reveal functional candidates for adaptation to the fluctuating thermal regime, we investigated the global transcriptomic response to a high temperature exposure in flies from both regimes. We found that flies selected both in constant and fluctuating thermal regimes responded similarly to increasing temperature. However, we found that evolutionary adaptation to the fluctuating thermal regime led to transcriptional enrichment of the GO terms eggshell chorion assembly and cellular response to heat The latter category was constituted by a constitutive up -regulation of four Turandot genes and not heat shock protein genes, suggesting that Turandot genes could play a prominent role for adaptation to daily fluctuating thermal conditions.","[Manenti, Tommaso; Loeschcke, Volker; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov] Aarhus Univ, Sect Genet Ecol & Evolut, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 114-116,Bldg 1540, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Aarhus University","Sorensen, JG (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Sect Genet Ecol & Evolut, Dept Biosci, Ny Munkegade 114-116,Bldg 1540, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.","jesper.soerensen@bios.au.dk","Loeschcke, Volker/J-2527-2013; Sørensen, Jesper Givskov/J-3190-2013","Loeschcke, Volker/0000-0003-1450-0754; Sørensen, Jesper Givskov/0000-0002-9149-3626","graduate school of Science and Technology (GSST) at Science and Technology; Aarhus University; Independent Research Fund Denmark, Natural Sciences","graduate school of Science and Technology (GSST) at Science and Technology; Aarhus University; Independent Research Fund Denmark, Natural Sciences","The authors would like to thank Doth Andersen, Annemarie Hojmark and Marta Falaschi for their help with the laboratory work.

Eggs of the lizard Anolis sagrei were incubated under one of three fluctuating thermal regimes that mimicked natural nest environments and differed in mean and maximum temperatures. After emergence, all hatchlings were raised under common garden conditions until reproductive maturity, at which point heat tolerance was measured. Egg mortality was highest in the warmest treatment, and hatchlings from the warmest treatment tended to have greater mortality than those from the cooler treatments. Despite evidence that incubation temperatures were stressful, we found no evidence that incubation treatment influenced adult heat tolerance.

Thus, the direction and intensity of sexual selection should be affected by thermal conditions. However, the effects of temperature variation during mating events have sometimes been overlooked. We assessed traits associated with pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection in the cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne, using three thermal mating conditions: 19 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 31 degrees C. Thermal conditions did not affect precopulatory traits (mating rate, mating latency and courtship intensity). Mating duration increased with decreasing temperature, whereas the number of sperm transferred and female fecundity were greatest at 25 degrees C. To investigate whether these thermal differences affected the risk of sperm competition (remating rate) and fitness consequences for both sexes, we conducted double-mating experiments using a black colour mutant. Females that had first mated at low or high temperatures were more likely to accept remating and exhibited higher fecundity compared to females that rejected remating; when females remated, the paternity of the first male was highest at 25 degrees C. Thermal conditions at the first mating event affected the fitness consequences for both sexes, irrespective of the females' remating acceptance. Changes to the thermal conditions for the female remating event caused no difference in the female remating rate or fecundity; however, the paternity of the second mate was highest at the intermediate temperature, and this could be attributed to the decreased sperm transfer at low and high temperatures. Our results suggest that temperature conditions during mating affect postcopulatory processes in L. serricorne. In particular, when females first mated at extreme temperatures, polyandry was promoted, potentially favouring males with higher sperm competitive ability through increased likelihood and intensity of sperm competition.

Significant differences could be observed in the contents of the total lipid and fatty acid compositions among different temperatures (4, 25 and 38 degrees C). The study showed that liver and muscle were principal sites of lipid storage. Triacylglycerol (TAG) mainly deposited in the liver, while phospholipids (PL) was identified as the predominant lipid class in the muscle and brain. Palmitic and stearic acid generally occupied the higher proportion in saturated fatty acids (SFA), while monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) consisted mainly of 16: 1n - 7, 18: 1n - 9, 18:2n - 6, 18:3n - 3, 20:4n - 6 and 22:6n - 3 regardless of tissue and temperature. These predominant fatty acids proportion fluctuations caused by temperature affected directly the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids.

An organism's environment, particularly early in development, can profoundly shape its future phenotypes. While the long-term consequences of embryonic temperature are well studied in vertebrates, insects have complex life cycles that may uncouple temperature's effects in one stage from physiology in the next. 2. This study examines how egg temperature affects insect performance across all subsequent life stages. We focused on the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, and examined how egg temperatures affected hatching time, hatchling mass, larval growth, development time, head capsule size, pupal mass and adult fecundity. Eggs were exposed to either diurnal temperature cycles or a single heat shock; in both experiments, temperatures were within the range to which eggs are typically exposed in the field. 3. Although the consequences of egg temperature varied depending on the type of treatment, both cycling temperatures and heat shock affected egg development time and initial larval growth rate, which likely have fitness consequences for M. sexta in nature. In contrast, egg temperature had no persistent effect on any trait measured in later larval stages, pupae or adults. 4. Organisms with complex life cycles -Manduca has four distinct life stages and multiple larval sub-stages - may benefit from rapid compensation for poor early conditions. Additionally, the modularity of insect life cycles may help insects cope with environmental variability by insulating later stages from disturbances during embryogenesis.","[Potter, Kristen A.; Woods, H.

Here, we investigated the photosynthetic responses of two local dominant wetland plants to two simulated air-warming scenarios (+2 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees C and +3.5 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees C) by using open-top chambers in the northwest Yunnan plateau. During the growing season from 2014 to 2016, we explored photosynthetic parameters and the relationships linking photosynthesis to temperature variations. We found that open-top chambers had increased the daily maximum temperature as well as DTRs. The photosynthetic responses of two plant species to warming were species-specific during the first two years but species-independent in the third year. The two warming scenarios did not significantly alter the linear relationships linking maximum net photosynthetic rate (A(max)) to stomatal conductance (g(s)), intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i), and transpiration rate (T-r), despite changes in slopes and intercepts of the fitted lines. The DTRs between 0 degrees C and 30 degrees C were positively correlated with photosynthesis, while DTRs over 30 degrees C were negatively correlated with photosynthesis. Our results provide experimental evidence that temperature variations play a greater role than increasing average temperature in explaining plant photosynthesis, and more attention should be paid to temperature variations when assessing the impact of climate warming on wetland ecosystem.","[Xiao, Derong; Yan, Pengfei; Zhan, Pengfei; Zhang, Yun; Liu, Zhenya; Tian, Kun; Wang, Hang] Southwest Forestry Univ, Natl Plateau Wetlands Res Ctr, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Xingzhong] Chongqing Key Lab Wetland Sci Res Upper Reaches Y, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China","Southwest Forestry University - China","Wang, H (corresponding author), Southwest Forestry Univ, Natl Plateau Wetlands Res Ctr, Kunming 650224, Yunnan, Peoples R China.","hwang17@163.com","Derong, Xiao/AAA-3689-2019","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31370497, 41877346]; Yunnan Innovative Research Team of Plateau Wetland Science [2012HC007]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Yunnan Innovative Research Team of Plateau Wetland Science","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31370497 and 41877346) and the Yunnan Innovative Research Team of Plateau Wetland Science (2012HC007).

Seasonal fluctuations in temperature are of particular importance in aquatic ectotherms since their body temperature is in equilibrium with their environment. When an organism faces adverse environmental conditions, it can either remain active or enter into metabolic depression, adopting the strategy that maximises its fitness. Physiological responses to environmental stress occur at many different levels of organisation in an animal. Here, we focus on mitochondria, given their central importance in cellular energy metabolism. We contrast the thermal biology of skeletal muscle mitochondria from cold-active species with that of species that spend their winters in a metabolically depressed state. Specifically, we examine the modifications of mitochondrial properties during thermal/seasonal acclimation and examine mechanisms by which these modifications can arise. While compensatory responses to cold acclimation include increases in mitochondrial abundance, in the oxidative capacities of individual mitochondria and adjustments of ADP affinities, metabolic depression can reduce tissue levels of mitochondrial enzymes and mitochondrial proton leak rates.","Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1T 2M7, Canada; MRC, Dunn Human Nutr Unit, Cambridge CB2 2XY, England","Laval University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Medical Research Council UK (MRC); MRC Human Nutrition Research","Guderley, H (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1T 2M7, Canada.","helga.guderley@bio.ulaval.ca","St-Pierre, Julie/AGB-3651-2022","St-Pierre, Julie/0000-0002-2815-7099","","","",NA,"107","142","152","1","59","COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND","0022-0949","","","J EXP BIOL","J.

The ways that fluctuations in prey abundance and weather conditions can affect reproductive output in a 'capital breeding' ectotherm, the aspic viper ( Vipera aspis) were examined. 2. Our longitudinal study confirms that female aspic vipers adjust reproductive investment by integrating allocations of energy from stores ('capital') and facultative feeding ('income'). Thus, long-term energy storage enabled females to reproduce successfully even in years when prey were scarce. 3. Not surprisingly, temporal changes in body reserves of female vipers preparing for reproduction depended upon current feeding rates. However, the mean environmental temperature during the active season also affected mass gain. 4. Allometric patterns suggest that reproductive output was limited by energy availability in 8 out of the 9 years of our study. In the other year, high prey availability in the preceding season meant that reproductive output was maximized within the constraints set by maternal body size (and thus, abdominal volume). 5. High summer temperatures increased basking opportunities of gravid vipers and thus accelerated gestation. However, maternal metabolic costs also increased in such situations, resulting in low postpartum body condition.","CNRS, CEBC, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; Univ Poitiers, F-86022 Poitiers, France; Conseil Gen Deux Sevres, F-79000 Niort, France; Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Arizona State Univ, Dept Biol, Tempe, AZ USA","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Poitiers; University of Sydney; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe","Lourdais, O (corresponding author), CNRS, CEBC, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.","lourdais@cebc.cnrs.fr","Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008","Bonnet, Xavier/0000-0001-6150-8199; Lourdais, Olivier/0000-0001-7840-103X","","","",NA,"52","109","113","1","26","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-8790","1365-2656","","J ANIM ECOL","J.

When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability (> 20 degrees C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24 C) or fluctuating temperatures (18-32 degrees C) under high or low UV-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment.","[Kern, Pippa; Cramp, Rebecca L.; Franklin, Craig E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","University of Queensland","Kern, P (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.","pippa.kern@uqconnect.edu.au","Cramp, Rebecca L/A-4488-2010; Kern, Pippa/AAU-5236-2020; Franklin, Craig/G-7343-2012","Cramp, Rebecca L/0000-0001-9798-2271; Kern, Pippa/0000-0001-8658-2811; Franklin, Craig/0000-0003-1315-3797","University of Queensland postgraduate scholarship; Australian Research Council Discovery grant","University of Queensland postgraduate scholarship(University of Queensland); Australian Research Council Discovery grant(Australian Research Council)","P.

Jensen's inequality states that for non-lineal processes, such as most biological phenomena, the effects of thermal fluctuations cannot be predicted from mean constant temperatures. We studied the effect of daily temperature fluctuation (DTF) on Rhodnius prolixus, a model organism in insect physiology, and an important vector of Chagas disease. We measured development time from egg to adult, fecundity, fertility, body mass reduction rate (indirect measurement of nutrient consumption rates) and survival after a single blood meal. Insects were reared at constant temperature (24 degrees C), or with a DTF (17-32 degrees C; mean = 24 degrees C). Taking into account Jensen's inequality as well as the species tropical distribution, we predict that living in a variable thermal environment will have higher costs than inhabiting a stable one. Development time and fertility were not affected by DTF. However, fecundity was lower in females reared at DTF than at constant temperature, and males had higher body mass reduction rate and lower survival in the DTF regime, suggesting higher costs associated to fluctuating thermal environments. At a population and epidemiological level, higher energetic costs would imply an increase in nutrient consumption rate, biting frequency, and, consequently increasing disease transmission from infected insects. On the contrary, lower fecundity could be associated with a decrease in population growth. This knowledge will not only provide basic information to the field of insect ecophysiology, but also could be a useful background to develop population and disease transmission models.","[Rolandi, Carmen; Schilman, Pablo E.] UBA, FCEyN, DBBE, Lab Ecofisiol Insectos, Ciudad Univ,Pabellon 2,CABA C1428EHA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rolandi, Carmen; Schilman, Pablo E.] CONICET UBA, IBBEA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires","Schilman, PE (corresponding author), UBA, FCEyN, DBBE, Lab Ecofisiol Insectos, Ciudad Univ,Pabellon 2,CABA C1428EHA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.","schilman@bg.fcen.uba.ar","Schilman, Pablo/GLR-8952-2022","Schilman, Pablo/0000-0003-1485-1650","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT) /Argentina [PICT-2015-3491]; Consejo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICET)/Argentina [PIP- 112-201301-00550]; CONICET","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT) /Argentina(ANPCyT); Consejo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICET)/Argentina; CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET))","This work was supported in part by Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT) /Argentina (PICT-2015-3491) and Consejo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICET)/Argentina (PIP- 112-201301-00550).

However, ectotherms are strongly affected by temperature and its variations. Most laboratory studies on effect of temperature on life history traits employ constant instead of fluctuating temperature regimes, though the latter is more reflective of nature. We conducted investigations on the effect of constant, fluctuating and alternate temperature regimes on reproductive and developmental attributes of a biocontrol agent ladybird, Menochilus sexmaculatus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). We used three constant, viz. cold, optimum and hot (15 degrees C, 27 degrees C and 35 degrees C); two fluctuating with variation in mean temperature of the day (15 degrees C/27 degrees C, 35 degrees C /27 degrees C; 10/14 h) and three alternating (15 degrees C/27 degrees C, 35 degrees C/27 C, 15 degrees C/35 degrees C; 24/24 h) temperatures to evaluate their effects on these life attributes. Oviposition and percent egg viability along with offspring development (immature life stages developmental time and developmental rate) and elytral colouration pattern of adults were observed. The best response in terms of oviposition and percent egg viability was recorded at the constant temperature of 27 degrees C followed by the fluctuating regime with a mean temperature of 30.3 degrees C. The fastest development was found at a constant temperature of 35 degrees C, followed by a fluctuating temperature of 35 degrees C/27 degrees C for 10/14 h. Among the different temperature cycles, the most uncustomary trend of oviposition and percent egg viability was recorded on an alternate temperature of 15 degrees C/35 degrees C for 24/24 h. The constant (27 degrees C) and fluctuating (35 degrees C/27 C for 10/14 h) temperatures caused an incremental effect on reproductive output and developmental rate. This study demonstrates that M. sexmaculatus is able to adjust its physiology according to surrounding environmental conditions and acclimatizes well with the fluctuating/alternate temperatures suggesting its wide range of tolerance. The findings of present work would be helpful in augmenting population dynamics of this biocontrol agent to suppress insect pest.","[Singh, Shashwat; Mishra, Geetanjali; Omkar] Univ Lucknow, Ladybird Res Lab, Dept Zool, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India","Lucknow University","Omkar (corresponding author), Univ Lucknow, Ladybird Res Lab, Dept Zool, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India.","shashwatnaman@gmail.com; geetanjalimishra@hotmail.com; omkaar55@hotmail.com","Mishra, Geetanjali/X-7796-2019","Singh, Shashwat/0000-0003-3745-7410; Mishra, Geetanjali/0000-0001-8976-4602","University Grants Commission, New Delhi, India under BSR scheme [F-25-1/2013-14(BSR)/7-109/2007(BSR)]","University Grants Commission, New Delhi, India under BSR scheme","SS gratefully acknowledges University Grants Commission (F-25-1/2013-14(BSR)/7-109/2007(BSR) dated 30.5.2014), New Delhi, India for providing fellowship under BSR scheme.",NA,"109","6","6","0","27","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0306-4565","","","J THERM BIOL","J.

For elasmobranchs (i.e. sharks, rays, and skates), studies documenting diel activity and movement patterns indicate that many species are crepuscular or nocturnal in nature. However, few studies have investigated the rhythmicity of elasmobranch physiology to understand the mechanisms underpinning these distinct patterns. Here, we assess diel patterns of metabolic rates in a small meso-predator, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), across ecologically relevant temperatures and upon acutely removing photoperiod cues. This species possibly demonstrates behavioral sleep during daytime hours, which is supported herein by low metabolic rates during the day and a 1.7-fold increase in metabolic rates at night. From spring to summer seasons, where average average water temperature temperatures for this species range 24.5 to 28.5 degrees C, time of day, and not temperature, had the strongest influence on metabolic rate. These results indicate that this species, and perhaps other similar species from tropical and coastal environments, may have physiological mechanisms in place to maintain metabolic rate on a seasonal time scale regardless of temperature fluctuations that are relevant to their native habitats.","[Wheeler, Carolyn R.; Rummer, Jodie L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, 1 James Cook Dr Douglas, Townsville, Qld 4814, Australia; [Wheeler, Carolyn R.; Mandelman, John W.] Univ Massachusetts Boston, Sch Environm, Boston, MA USA; [Kneebone, Jeff; Mandelman, John W.] New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, Boston, MA USA; [Heinrich, Dennis] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Strugnell, Jan M.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Strugnell, Jan M.] La Trobe Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Evolut, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Rummer, Jodie L.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia","James Cook University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston; Flinders University South Australia; James Cook University; La Trobe University; James Cook University","Wheeler, CR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, 1 James Cook Dr Douglas, Townsville, Qld 4814, Australia.","carolyn.wheeler23@gmail.com","","Wheeler, Carolyn/0000-0001-9976-8420","American Australian Association; JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship; Australian Research Council (ARC) Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Australian Wildlife Society; Australian Society for Fish Biology","American Australian Association; JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship; Australian Research Council (ARC) Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies(Australian Research Council); Australian Wildlife Society; Australian Society for Fish Biology","Support for this work was provided by an American Australian Association graduate scholarship (to C.R.W.), a JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship (to C.R.W.), the Australian Research Council (ARC) Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (to J.L.R.), the Australian Wildlife Society (to C.R.W.), the Australian Society for Fish Biology (to C.R.W.), and an anonymous donor to the New England Aquarium for funds contributed to equipment used in this study.

However, how these stressors affect structure and functionality of mollusk shells has received less attention. Episodic events of upwelling of deep cold and low pH waters are well documented in eastern boundary systems and may be stressful to mollusks, impairing both physiological and biomechanical performance. These events are projected to become more intense, and extensive in time with ongoing global warming. In this study, we evaluate the independent and interactive effects of temperature and pH on the biomineral and biomechanical properties of Argopecten purpuratus scallop shells. Total organic matter in the shell mineral increased under reduced pH (similar to 7.7) and control conditions (pH similar to 8.0). The periostracum layer coating the outer shell surface showed increased protein content under low pH conditions but decreasing sulfate and polysaccharides content. Reduced pH negatively impacts shell density and increases the disorder in the orientation of calcite crystals. At elevated temperatures (18 degrees C), shell microhardness increased. Other biomechanical properties were not affected by pH/temperature treatments. Thus, under a reduction of 0.3 pH units and low temperature, the response of A. purpuratus was a tradeoff among organic compounds (biopolymer plasticity), density, and crystal organization (mineral plasticity) to maintain shell biomechanical performance, while increased temperature ameliorated the impacts on shell hardness. Biopolymer plasticity was associated with ecophysiological performance, indicating that, under the influence of natural fluctuations in pH and temperature, energetic constraints might be critical in modulating the long-term sustainability of this compensatory mechanism.","[Lagos, Nelson A.; Benitez, Samanta] Univ Santo Tomas, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Invest & Innovac Cambio Climat CiiCC, Ejercito 146, Santiago, Chile; [Lagos, Nelson A.; Vargas, Cristian A.; Lardies, Marco A.] Inst Milenio Socioecol Costera SECOS, Santiago, Chile; [Benitez, Samanta] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Marinas & Limnol, Programa Doctorado Biol Marina, Valdivia, Chile; [Grenier, Cristian; Rodriguez-Navarro, Alejandro B.] Univ Granada, Fac Ciencias, Dept Petrol & Mineral, Granada, Spain; [Garcia-Herrera, Claudio; Abarca-Ortega, Aldo] Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Ingn Mecan, Santiago, Chile; [Abarca-Ortega, Aldo] Univ Politecn Madrid, Ctr Tecnol Biomed, Madrid 28223, Spain; [Vivanco, Juan F.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Ingn & Ciencias, Vina Del Mar, Chile; [Benjumeda, Isabel; Lardies, Marco A.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Artes Liberales, Santiago, Chile; [Vargas, Cristian A.] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Ambientales, Lab Ecosistemas Costeros & Cambio Ambiental Globa, Concepcion, Chile; [Vargas, Cristian A.] Univ Concepcion, Ctr EULA Chile, Concepcion, Chile; [Duarte, Cristian] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ciencias Vida, Dept Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago, Chile; [Duarte, Cristian] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ciencias Vida, Ctr Invest Marina Quintay CIMARQ, Santiago, Chile","Universidad Santo Tomas; Universidad Austral de Chile; University of Granada; Universidad de Santiago de Chile; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Centro de Tecnologia Biomedica (CTB); Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad de Concepcion; Universidad Andres Bello; Universidad Andres Bello","Lagos, NA (corresponding author), Univ Santo Tomas, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Invest & Innovac Cambio Climat CiiCC, Ejercito 146, Santiago, Chile.;Lagos, NA (corresponding author), Inst Milenio Socioecol Costera SECOS, Santiago, Chile.","nlagoss@santotomas.cl","Abarca-Ortega, Aldo/ABE-4995-2020","Abarca-Ortega, Aldo/0000-0002-1600-8555; Vivanco, Juan F./0000-0002-2659-368X; Vargas, Cristian A./0000-0002-1486-3611","PIA ANID [ACT 172037]; Fondecyt [1190444, 1210171]; ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program [ICN2019_015]; ANID doctoral scholarhip [21210012]; ANID PFCHA / Doctorados Becas Chile [Chile/2019-CEL00011051]","PIA ANID; Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); ANID - Millennium Science Initiative Program; ANID doctoral scholarhip; ANID PFCHA / Doctorados Becas Chile","This study was funded by PIA ANID ACT 172037 for international collaborative research among Chile (NAL, MAL, JV, CG-H, CD) and Spain (ARN, CG).

Geographic variation among populations in life history response to temperature mean and variability offers one view of the potential for local adaptation to broaden the thermal niche. We used laboratory growth experiments to examine the effects of temperatures between 13 degrees C and 30 degrees C on five life history traits and the intrinsic rate of increase for 15 Tigriopus californicus populations distributed over 17 degrees of latitude. Different life history stages showed distinct latitudinal shifts in thermal response, while the temperature of peak population growth consistently declined with increasing latitude. In addition, high-latitude populations grew faster at optimal temperatures but showed steeper fitness declines at high temperature. To test geographic population variation in response to the amplitude of daily thermal fluctuations, we grew three northern and three southern populations and manipulated nightly low and daily high temperatures. We found the lowest fitness overall in the treatment with the highest mean temperature, and the treatment with the greatest variability showed high fitness despite an 8 degrees C greater daily range. Population responses to daily thermal variability were unrelated to latitude of origin. Our results indicate that trade-offs between adaptation to high vs. low temperature, and between growth and maturation vs. survival and fecundity, govern local adaptation along the latitudinal gradient. They also indicate that T. californicus populations can maintain fitness over a wide range of daily variability but are more sensitive to small changes in the mean temperature.","[Hong, Brian C.; Shurin, Jonathan B.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","University of California System; University of California San Diego","Shurin, JB (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.","jshurin@ucsd.edu","","Shurin, Jonathan/0000-0001-7870-1972","University of California-San Diego","University of California-San Diego(University of California System)","We thank Chris Neufeld and Akana Noto for their help with copepod sampling.

Especially in ectotherms, temperature affects performance, physiology, and in some species, skin color. Skin color can be a sexual ornament signaling the bearer's ability to resist infections, when only high-quality individuals are able to invest both in high immune defense and elaborate ornament expression. However, how the information content of these sexual traits may vary with environmental conditions has been less studied. Dickerson's collared lizard (Crotaphytus dickersonae) males are blue and have a black and white collar. This conspicuous coloration signals performance and immune response, and is related to body temperature. Here, by maintaining males at higher, lower, and mean environmental temperatures we evaluated whether temperature variation influences color and constitutive innate humoral immunity (agglutination and lysis titers, estimated through hemolysis-hemagglutination assays), and whether extreme temperatures impose trade-offs between color and humoral immunity. We found that at low and high temperature treatments males had lower agglutination and lysis titers, and at low temperature, blue chroma from the dorsum declined and males became greener. Interestingly, at low and control temperature treatments, agglutination titer and blue coloration were positively correlated, whereas high temperatures revealed a trade-off between increasing agglutination titers and displaying bluer skin color. Our results suggest that in the Dickerson collared lizard even short-term variation of environmental temperature affects performance of constitutive innate humoral immunity and the brilliant blue skin color. Particularly, high temperatures may compromise some components of male's immunity and sexual signaling.","[Plasman, Melissa; Torres, Roxana] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Lab Conducta Anim, Circuito Exterior S-N Anexo Jardin Bot Exterior, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Plasman, Melissa] Univ Autonoma Tlaxcala, Ctr Tlaxcala Biol Conducta, Carretera Tlaxcala Puebla Km 1-5, Tlaxcala 90062, Mexico","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Torres, R (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ecol, Dept Ecol Evolut, Lab Conducta Anim, Circuito Exterior S-N Anexo Jardin Bot Exterior, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.","lrtorres@unam.mx","","Plasman, Melissa/0000-0001-5986-0679","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [PAPIIT-IN206713]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnoloia","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnoloia","This work was supported by Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (PAPIIT-IN206713) and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnoloia (PhD student scholarship to M.P.).",NA,"61","3","3","3","21","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0306-4565","","","J THERM BIOL","J.

Its efficiency might become imperative for securing activity budgets under future climate change. For diurnal lizards, thermal microhabitat variability appears to be of high importance, especially in hot deserts where vegetation is highly scattered and sensitive to climatic fluctuations. We investigated the effects of a shading gradient from vegetation on body temperatures and activity timing for two diurnal, terrestrial desert lizards, Ctenotus regius, and Morethia boulengeri, and analyzed their changes under past, present, and future climatic conditions. Both species' body temperatures and activity timing strongly depended on the shading gradient provided by vegetation heterogeneity. At high temperatures, shaded locations provided cooling temperatures and increased diurnal activity. Conversely, bushes also buffered cold temperature by saving heat. According to future climate change scenarios, cooler microhabitats might become beneficial to warm-adapted species, such as C. regius, by increasing the duration of daily activity. Contrarily, warmer microhabitats might become unsuitable for less warm-adapted species such as M.boulengeri for which midsummers might result in a complete restriction of activity irrespective of vegetation. However, total annual activity would still increase provided that individuals would be able to shift their seasonal timing towards spring and autumn. Overall, we highlight the critical importance of thermoregulatory behavior to buffer temperatures and its dependence on vegetation heterogeneity. Whereas studies often neglect ecological processes when anticipating species' responses to future climate change the strongest impact of a changing climate on terrestrial ectotherms in hot deserts is likely to be the loss of shaded microhabitats rather than the rise in temperature itself. We argue that conservation strategies aiming at addressing future climate changes should focus more on the cascading effects of vegetation rather than on shifts of species distributions predicted solely by climatic envelopes.","[Grimm-Seyfarth, Annegret; Mihoub, Jean-Baptiste; Henle, Klaus] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Conservat Biol, Leipzig, Germany; [Grimm-Seyfarth, Annegret] Univ Potsdam, Plant Ecol & Nat Conservat, Potsdam, Germany; [Mihoub, Jean-Baptiste] Sorbonne Univ, UPMC Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat,CESCO,UMR 7204, Paris, France","Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ); University of Potsdam; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite","Grimm-Seyfarth, A (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Conservat Biol, Leipzig, Germany.","Annegret.grimm@ufz.de","Grimm-Seyfarth, Annegret/I-9243-2019; Mihoub, Jb/B-7708-2015; Henle, Klaus/I-6837-2013","Grimm-Seyfarth, Annegret/0000-0003-0577-7508; Mihoub, Jb/0000-0002-5354-850X; Henle, Klaus/0000-0002-6647-5362","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft",NA,"56","17","17","2","21","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

This developmental plasticity to changing thermal conditions is expected to be a primary factor that dictates the vulnerability of amphibians to increasing ambient temperatures such as are predicted in climate change scenarios. We analyzed the patterns of thermal effects on size and age at metamorphosis to investigate whether the intraspecific temperature-size rule is applicable over a broad range of anuran species by carrying out a combined analysis based on the data from 25 studies performed on 18 anuran species. Furthermore, we tested whether the thermal background of respective populations impacts the capacity for a plastic response in metamorphic traits. We could confirm this pattern for across population comparisons. All included populations developed faster and 75% were smaller at the onset of metamorphosis when developmental temperatures were warmer, but the sensitivity of growth and developmental rate to a given temperature change was different. We found that the thermal background of a population influences the sensitivity of metamorphic traits and thus, the capacity for a plastic response in growth and developmental rate. Warm adapted populations were less sensitive to temperature variation indicating a reduced capacity for developmental plasticity and therefore, those species may be more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Future studies should include a broader range of rearing temperatures and temperature fluctuations to determine full knowledge of the capacity for developmental plasticity within a species-specific thermal window.","[Ruthsatz, Katharina; Dausmann, Kathrin H.; Glos, Julian] Univ Hamburg, Bioctr Grindel, Dept Anim Ecol & Conservat, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Peck, Myron A.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci, Olbersweg 24, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Sabatino, Nikita M.] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Dept Life Sci, Ulmenliet 20, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany","University of Hamburg; University of Hamburg; Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg","Ruthsatz, K (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Bioctr Grindel, Dept Anim Ecol & Conservat, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.","fejx629@studium.uni-hamburg.de; myron.peck@uni-hamburg.de; kathrin.dausmann@uni-hamburg.de; nikita.sabatino@haw-hamburg.de; julian.glos@uni-hamburg.de","","Ruthsatz, Katharina/0000-0002-3273-2826","","","",NA,"107","20","22","0","47","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0306-4565","","","J THERM BIOL","J.

Yet for most turtle species, including the estuarine diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), there is limited information on embryonic sensitivity to elevated temperature. We incubated eggs of M. terrapin at three, mean temperatures (31, 34, 37 degrees C) under two thermal exposure regimes (constant or semi-naturally fluctuating temperature) and measured hatching success, developmental rate, and hatchling size. Hatching success was 100% at 31 degrees C and 67% at 34 degrees C, respectively; at 37 degrees C, all eggs failed early in the incubation period. These values were unaffected by exposure regime. The modeled LT50 (temperature that was lethal to 50% of the test population) was 34.0 degrees C in the constant and 34.2 degrees C in the fluctuating thermal regime, reflecting a steep decline in survival between 33 and 35 degrees C. Hatchlings having been incubated at a constant 34 degrees C hatched sooner than those incubated at 31 degrees C under either constant or fluctuating temperature. Hatchlings were smaller in straight carapace length (CL) and width after having been incubated at 34 degrees C compared to 31 degrees C. Larger (CL) hatchlings resulted from fluctuating temperature conditions relative to constant temperature conditions, regardless of mean temperature. Based upon recent temperatures in natural nests, the M. terrapin population studied here appears to possess resiliency to several degrees of elevated mean nest temperatures, beyond which, embryonic mortality will likely sharply increase. When considered within the mosaic of challenges that Maryland's M. terrapin face as the climate warms, including ongoing habitat losses due to sea level rise and impending thermal impacts on bioenergetics and offspring sex ratios, a future increase in embryonic mortality could be a critical factor for a population already experiencing ecological and physiological challenges due to climate change.","[Rowe, Christopher L.; Liang, Dong; Woodland, Ryan J.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Chesapeake Biol Lab, 146 Williams St,POB 38, Solomons, MD 20688 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science","Rowe, CL (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Chesapeake Biol Lab, 146 Williams St,POB 38, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.","Rowe@umces.edu","Liang, Dong/J-3691-2016; Woodland, Ryan J/D-5344-2017","Liang, Dong/0000-0002-0550-7324; Woodland, Ryan J/0000-0002-3309-3413","Maryland Sea Grant [SA071338101-H]","Maryland Sea Grant","We thank R.

Two important and connected topics have been largely ignored in this context: (i) the increase of daily temperature variation (DTV) as a key component of climate change, and (ii) differences in sensitivity to climate change and contaminants between developmental stages. We therefore investigated whether DTV magnified the negative effects of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos on mortality and heat tolerance and whether this effect was stronger in aquatic larvae than in terrestrial adults of the mosquito Culex pipiens. Exposure to chlorpyrifos at a constant temperature imposed mortality and reduced the heat tolerance in both larvae and adult males, but not in adult females. This provides the first evidence that the TICS (toxicant-induced climate change sensitivity) concept can be sex-specific. DTV had no direct negative effects. Yet, consistent with the CITS (climate-induced toxicant sensitivity) concept, DTV magnified the toxicity of the pesticide in terms of larval mortality. This was not the case in the adult stage indicating the CITS concept to be dependent on the developmental stage. Notably, chlorpyrifos reduced the heat tolerance of adult females only in the presence of DIV, thereby providing support for the reciprocal effects between DTV and contaminants, hence the coupling of the TICS and CITS concepts.

Here, we used in vitro electrophysiological and anatomical approaches to investigate a thermosensory pathway in the CNSS. We showed that the CNSS responds directly to local hypothermal challenge via the TRP channel, and transmits this signal using the neurotransmitter, GABA, to the neurosecretory Dahlgren cells of the CNSS.

Unless the rate of a biological process changes linearly within the range of these fluctuations, the cumulative effect of temperature differs from the effect measured at the average temperature (Jensen's inequality). Here, we measured numbers and types of spores released by aquatic hyphomycetes from oak and alder leaves that had been exposed in a Portuguese stream for between 7 and 94 days. Recovered leaves were incubated at four temperatures between 5 and 20 A degrees C. Over this range, the sporulation response to temperature was decelerating, with an estimated optimum around 12.5 A degrees C. Assuming a linear response, therefore, overestimates spore release from decaying leaves. The calculated discrepancy was more pronounced with recalcitrant oak leaves (greater toughness, phenolics concentration, lower N and P concentration than alder), and reached 26.6 % when temperature was assumed to oscillate between 1 and 9 A degrees C, rather than remaining constant at 5 A degrees C. The maximum fluctuation of water temperature over 48 h during the field experiment was approximately 3 A degrees C, which would result in a discrepancy of up to 6 %. The composition of the fungal community (assessed by species identification of released spores) was significantly influenced by the state of decomposition, but not by leaf species or temperature. When quantifying the potential impact of global change on aquatic fungal communities, the average increase as well as fluctuations of the temperature have to be considered.","[Baerlocher, Felix] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, Canada; [Kebede, Yared Kassahun; Goncalves, Ana Lucia; Canhoto, Cristina] Univ Coimbra, IMAR CMA, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal; [Kebede, Yared Kassahun; Goncalves, Ana Lucia; Canhoto, Cristina] Univ Coimbra, Dept Life Sci, P-3001401 Coimbra, Portugal","Mount Allison University; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra","Barlocher, F (corresponding author), Mt Allison Univ, Dept Biol, Sackville, NB E4L 1G7, Canada.","fbaerlocher@mta.ca","Baerlocher, Felix/C-1307-2011; Gonçalves, Ana Lúcia/L-8412-2014; Canhoto, Cristina/M-4211-2014","Baerlocher, Felix/0000-0003-2404-625X; Gonçalves, Ana Lúcia/0000-0003-3693-9792; Canhoto, Cristina/0000-0003-3343-8757","Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT) [SFRH/BD/47089/2008]; FEDER Funds through the Program Operational Factors of Competitiveness (COMPETE); National Funds through the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT) [PTDC/CLI/67180/2006]","Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT)(Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology); FEDER Funds through the Program Operational Factors of Competitiveness (COMPETE); National Funds through the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation (FCT)","We thank Ana Lirio for assistance in the field and the laboratory.

We used foraging workers of the Neotropical ant Ectatomma ruidum to assess whether diurnally and nocturnally active workers differed in thermal tolerance. We compared critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of nocturnal and diurnal foraging workers to explore thermal niche specialization over the diel cycle. We predicted that diurnally active workers would have higher CTmax because they occupy a warmer thermal niche. As predicted, diurnal foragers exhibited significantly higher CTmax (mean 1.1 A degrees C difference) than nocturnal foragers. Diurnal and nocturnal foragers were similar in body size, and there was no relationship between worker size and CTmax. We discuss possible mechanisms for this pattern, and the implications of within- versus between-colony differences in CTmax.","[Esch, C.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Jimenez, J.

Nevertheless, the likely more stressful, realistic combination of the two warming-related stressors has rarely been considered in ecotoxicology. Moreover, we have little knowledge on whether these stressor combinations could impair ecosystem functioning. We examined the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos under an increased mean temperature (+4 degrees C, from 18 degrees C to 22 degrees C) and in the presence of DTF (constant and 8 degrees C) on two life-history traits (mortality and growth rate) and one ecologically important behavioural trait (feeding rate) in the freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus. The chlorpyrifos concentration used, 0.2 mu g/L, did not cause mortality in any thermal condition, nor did it cause sublethal effects at the mean temperature of 18 degrees C. A key finding was that growth rate was strongly reduced by the pesticide only under the combination of both a higher mean temperature and DTF, highlighting the importance of testing toxicity under this realistic thermal scenario. The leaf consumption of chlorpyrifos-exposed isopods increased at the higher mean temperature when this was kept constant, however, it lowered again towards control levels when DTF was induced, thereby contributing to the growth reduction at this most stressful condition. These alterations of growth and leaf degradation rates may impact nutrient recycling, a key ecosystem function. Our results highlight the importance of integrating both increases in mean temperature and in DTF to improve current and future ecological risk assessment of pesticides. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A common assumption when estimating winter energy budgets is that endotherms should hibernate at the ambient temperature (T-a) that minimizes torpid metabolic rate (TMR) and maximizes the duration of torpor bouts. However, previous studies of the energetic benefits of hibernation have assumed constant T-a within hibernacula. Here we use an individual-based energetic model to estimate overwinter energy expenditure of mammals hibernating at T(a)s that vary temporally. We show that, in accordance with the principles of Jenson's inequality, hibernators can conserve energy by selecting microclimates warmer than the single Ta value that minimizes TMR (Train). As temporal variation in Ta increases, endotherms should choose microclimates with mean Tas progressively warmer than T-min. Further, as thermal conductance decreases, as it does with increasing body mass and use of social thermoregulation, the mean Ta that minimizes overwinter energy expenditure approaches, but never equals, Train. We suggest that the commonly held assumption of stable microclimates in hibernacula has skewed the interpretation of the optimal expression of hibernation for energy conservation. Our results contradict much of the accepted understanding of hibernation energetics and add to a growing body of literature proposing that hibernating at a Ta warmer than T-min is optimal.

Maximum likelihood modeling approaches were used to estimate thermal responses in development, survival, and longevity. A model describing the effect of temperature on potential fecundity of the parasitoid was also developed taking oogenesis and oosorption into account. In -host and pupal development rates of the parasitoid increased with temperature up to 25 degrees C, and decreased thereafter. Immature survival was highest below 20 degrees C, and rapidly decreased at higher temperatures. Adult longevity decreased exponentially with increasing temperature for both males and females. Highest potential fecundity was reached at 10 degrees C. Considering survival and potential fecundity, the parasitoid seems best adapted to cool temperatures below 20 degrees C. Simulations of the life -history traits under variable temperature regimes indicate that temperature fluctuations decrease survival and increase realised fecundity compared to constant temperatures. The temperature-dependent fecundity model developed can be applied to other non -host feeding synovigenic parasitoids. The equations and parameter estimates provided in this paper can be used to build comprehensive models predicting the seasonal phenology of this parasitoid and spruce budworm parasitism under changing climatic conditions.

The effect of DTF on pesticide toxicity may be explained by: (i) a DTF-specific mechanism (caused by Jensen's inequality) and (ii) general mechanisms underlying an increased pesticide toxicity at both higher (increased energetic costs, pesticide uptake and metabolic conversion) and lower constant temperatures (lower organismal metabolic and associated elimination rates, increased sodium channel modulated nervous system vulnerability and energetic costs). Furthermore, DTF may enhance pesticide-induced reductions in heat tolerance due to stronger effects on oxygen demand (increase) and oxygen supply (decrease).

We evaluated abundance dynamics of five common species of diurnal lizards over 25 years in a Sonoran Desert transition zone where precipitation decreased and temperature increased across time, and assessed hypotheses for the influence of climatic flux on spatiotemporal variation in abundances. We repeatedly surveyed lizards in spring and summer of each year at up to 32 sites, and used hierarchical mixture models to estimate detection probabilities, abundances, and population growth rates. Among terrestrial species, abundances of a short-lived, winter-spring breeder increased markedly by an estimated 237%-285% across time, while two larger spring-summer breeders with higher thermal preferences declined by up to 64%. Abundances of two arboreal species that occupy shaded and thus sheltered microhabitats fluctuated but did not decline systematically. Abundances of all species increased with precipitation at short lag times (1-1.5 years) likely due to enhanced food availability, but often declined after periods of high precipitation at longer lag times (2-4 years) likely due to predation and other biotic pressures. Although rising maximum daily temperatures (T-max) are expected to drive global declines of lizards, associations with T-max were variable and weak for most species. Instead, abundances of all species declined with rising daily minimum temperatures, suggesting degradation of cool refugia imposed widespread metabolic or other costs. Our results suggest climate warming and drying are having major impacts on lizard communities by driving declines in species with traits that augment exposure to abiotic extremes and by modifying species interactions. The complexity of patterns we report indicates that evaluating and responding to the influence of climate change on biodiversity must consider a broad array of ecological processes.","[Flesch, Aaron D.] Univ Arizona, Desert Lab, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Rosen, Philip C.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ USA; [Holm, Peter] Natl Pk Serv, Organ Pipe Cactus Natl Monument, Ajo, AZ USA","University of Arizona; University of Arizona; United States Department of the Interior","Flesch, AD (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Desert Lab, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.","flesch@email.arizona.edu","","Flesch, Aaron/0000-0003-3434-0778","U.S. National Park Service (NPS)","U.S. National Park Service (NPS)","We thank the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) for support and for developing monitoring in OPCNM, especially superintendents H.Smith and B.

Changing temperature, in particular, can directly impact ectotherms and their parasites, with potential consequences for whole ecosystems. The potential of parasite populations to adapt to climate change largely depends on the amount of genetic variation they possess in their responses to environmental fluctuations. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to look at differences among parasite genotypes in response to temperature, with the goal of quantifying the extent of variation among conspecifics in their responses to increasing temperature. Snails infected with single genotypes of the trematode Maritrema novaezealandensis were sequentially acclimatised to two different temperatures, 'current' (15 degrees C) and 'elevated' (20 degrees C), over long periods. These temperatures are based on current average field conditions in the natural habitat and those predicted to occur during the next few decades. The output and activity of cercariae (free-swimming infective stages emerging from snails) were assessed for each genotype at each temperature. The results indicate that, on average, both cercarial output and activity are higher at the elevated acclimation temperature. More importantly, the output and activity of cercariae are strongly influenced by a genotype-by-temperature interaction, such that different genotypes show different responses to increasing temperature. Both the magnitude and direction (increase or decrease) of responses to temperature varied widely among genotypes. Therefore, there is much potential for natural selection to act on this variation, and predicting how the trematode M. novaezealandensis will respond to the climate changes predicted for the next century will prove challenging.

Because temperature shows pronounced natural daily fluctuations, we examined if experiments based on a constant temperature range can mask the real effects of the thermal regime on host-parasitoid interactions. The effects of two fluctuating thermal regimes on several developmental parameters of the Drosophila larval parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi were analyzed in this study. Regime 1 included a range of 16-23-16 degrees C and regime 2 included a range of 16-21-26-21-16 degrees C (mean temperature 20.1 degrees C) compared to a 20.1 degrees C constant temperature. Under an average temperature of 20.1 degrees C, which corresponds to a cold condition of L. boulardi development, we showed that the success of parasitism is significantly higher under a fluctuating temperature regime than at constant temperature. A fluctuating regime also correlated with a reduced development time of the parasitoids. In contrast, the thermal regime did not affect the ability of Drosophila to resist parasitoid infestation. Finally, we demonstrated that daily temperature fluctuation prevented the entry into diapause for this species, which is normally observed at a constant temperature of 21 degrees C. Overall, the results reveal that constant temperature experiments can produce misleading results, highlighting the need to study the thermal biology of organisms under fluctuating regimes that reflect natural conditions as closely as possible. This is particularly a major issue in host-parasitoid associations, which constitute a good model to understand the effect of climate warming on interacting species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Because many animals are exposed to considerable thermal variation in winter, they may benefit from a quick enhancement of cold tolerance prior to extreme low temperature. Hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) overwintering in their natal nests experience substantial thermal variation in winter, and recently, it was found that brief subzero chilling of winter-acclimated hatchlings decreases subsequent chilling-induced mortality, increases blood concentrations of glucose and lactate, and protects the brain from cryoinjury. Here, we further characterize that phenomenon, termed 'cold conditioning', by exposing winter-acclimated hatchling turtles to -3.5, -7.0, or -10.5 A degrees C gradually or repeatedly via daily thermal fluctuations over the course of 5 days and assessing their survival of a subsequent cold shock to a discriminating temperature of -12.7 A degrees C. To better understand the physiological response to cold conditioning, we measured changes in glucose and lactate concentrations in the liver, blood, and brain. Cold conditioning significantly increased cold-shock survival, from 9% in reference turtles up to 74% in cold-conditioned turtles, and ecologically relevant daily thermal fluctuations were at least as effective at conferring cryoprotection as was gradual cold conditioning. Cold conditioning increased glucose concentrations, up to 25 mu mol g(-1), and lactate concentrations, up to 30 mu mol g(-1), in the liver, blood, and brain. Turtles that were cold conditioned with daily thermal fluctuations accumulated more glucose in the liver, blood, and brain, and had lower brain lactate, than those gradually cold conditioned. Given the thermal variation to which hatchling painted turtles are exposed in winter, we suggest that the supplemental protection conferred by cold conditioning, especially that induced by daily thermal fluctuations, may be important for their overwinter survival. Investigation into the duration of the cold-conditioning induced protection and its occurrence in natural field conditions is needed to better understand its ecological significance. We suggest that future work exploring the underlying mechanisms of cold conditioning should focus on non-colligative effects of glucose, expression of small Hsps, changes in membrane structure, and ion homeostasis.","[Wiebler, James M.; Kumar, Manisha; Muir, Timothy J.] Augustana Coll, Biol Dept, Rock Isl, IL 61201 USA; [Wiebler, James M.] Miami Univ, Dept Biol, Oxford, OH 45056 USA","University System of Ohio; Miami University","Muir, TJ (corresponding author), Augustana Coll, Biol Dept, Rock Isl, IL 61201 USA.","timmuir@augustana.edu","","Muir, Timothy/0000-0002-3088-4279","Augustana College Summer Research Fellowship Awards; Sigma Xi Grant in Aid of Research; Dr. Larry P.

In the Pacific Coast of Baja California, this species experiences seasonal fluctuations of temperature. It was determined the preferred temperature (PT), critical threshold limits represented for Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax) and oxygen consumption rate in organisms acclimated to 16 degrees C, 19 degrees C, 22 degrees C, and 25 degrees C in controlled conditions. The PT of A. stellata was determined in organisms using the acute method. As the acclimation temperature increases, the PT also increases significantly (P < 0.05) and decreases to 22.8 degrees C. In the acclimation temperature of 25 degrees C, PT for black sea urchins was 23.3 degrees C +/- 0.3 degrees C. A direct relation was determined between the CTMax and acclimation temperatures being of 36.48 degrees C +/- 0.6 degrees C, 37.64 degrees C +/- 0.76 degrees C, 38.08 degrees C +/- 0.94 degrees C, 38.42 degrees C +/- 0.71 degrees C. The end point of CTMax was stage E4, where the sea urchins stop moving, relax the large spines but activity continues with light movements of small spines and when the organisms lose the ability to remain attached to the substrate. The oxygen consumption rates increased significantly (P < 0.05) from 5.59 to 11.5 mg O-2 kg/h wet weight (w.w.) as the acclimation temperature increased from 16 degrees C to 25 degrees C. The range of temperature coefficient (Q(10)) between 16 degrees C and 25 degrees C (lowest) was 1.90, indicating that within that range of acclimation temperature, organisms are adapted to maintain homeostasis. This corresponded with the interval of PT of the species. These results may partially explain their distribution pattern in Baja California Coast.","[Diaz, Fernando; Denisse Re, Ana; Licea, Alexei] CICESE Ensenada, Dept Biotecnol Marina, Lab Ecofisiol Organismos Acuat, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3918, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Galindo-Sanchez, Clara E.; Perez-Carrasco, Leonel] CICESE Ensenada, Lab Genom Func, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3918, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Carpizo-Ituarte, Eugenio; Gonzalez, Marco] UABC Ensenada, Inst Invest Oceanol, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3917, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico; [Sanchez, Adolfo; Rosas, Carlos] UNAM, Fac Ciencias, Unidad Multidisciplinaria Docencia & Invest, Puerto de Abrigo S-N, Sisal Merida, Mexico","CICESE - Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada; CICESE - Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Diaz, F (corresponding author), CICESE Ensenada, Dept Biotecnol Marina, Lab Ecofisiol Organismos Acuat, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3918, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico.","fdiaz@cicese.mx","Galindo-Sánchez, Clara E./B-8196-2015; Diaz, Fernando/J-5014-2016; Rosas, Carlos/A-7052-2009; Navaro, Alexei Fedorovish Licea/B-4106-2016; Diaz, Fernando/X-1430-2019","Galindo-Sánchez, Clara E./0000-0001-7514-2327; Diaz, Fernando/0000-0003-1614-6795; Navaro, Alexei Fedorovish Licea/0000-0003-4022-7405; Diaz, Fernando/0000-0003-1614-6795; Carpizo-Ituarte, Eugenio/0000-0002-3253-2357; Re Araujo, Ana Denise/0000-0002-9639-9866","CONACYT [264 554]","CONACYT(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","We acknowledge CONACYT for a national sabbatical stay scholarship no. 264 554 to Fernando Diaz.",NA,"62","10","10","0","38","NATL SHELLFISHERIES ASSOC","GROTON","C/O DR.

Partial migration is a common form of life-history diversity in which a population contains both migratory and resident behaviours. Salmonid fish exhibit a wide range of life-history diversity and, in particular, partial migration. We evaluated the effect of temperature-driven life-history modifications on population dynamics in partially migratory masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) by field observations and theoretical models. Field observations revealed that spatial patterns of alternative migratory tactics were associated with temperature gradients. The occurrence of resident males increased, whereas the proportion of migrant males and the proportion of delayed migrants including both sexes decreased with increasing temperature and, thereby, with improved early growth conditions. The expected fitness for each migratory tactic was computed in a life-history model with early growth conditions as a function. Individual fitness was maximized by adopting resident tactics under favourable early growth conditions, early migrant tactics under intermediate early growth conditions and delayed migrant tactics under unfavourable early growth conditions. The results suggest that individuals exhibited a status-dependent conditional strategy, that is, the adoption of alternative migratory tactics is influenced by the status of individuals to make the best of a situation. A simulation model suggests that increased residency by males to increased temperature leads to a substantial decrease in the number of migrants. Moreover, the decrease in the number of delayed (older) migrants with increasing temperature magnified fluctuations in abundance. Our findings indicate the importance of temperature-driven life-history modifications for predicting dynamics of natural populations under climate warming.","[Morita, Kentaro; Nagasawa, Toru] Fisheries Res Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Toyohira Ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Tamate, Tsuyoshi] Fisheries Res Agcy, Tohoku Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Shiogama, Japan; [Kuroki, Mari] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan","Fisheries Research Agency - Japan; Fisheries Research Agency - Japan; University of Tokyo","Morita, K (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Toyohira Ku, 2-2 Nakanoshima, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.","moritak@affrc.go.jp","Kuroki, Mari/AAA-6452-2021; Morita, Kentaro/G-2578-2015","Kuroki, Mari/0000-0002-9722-155X; Morita, Kentaro/0000-0002-7803-2438","JSPS KAKENHI [22780187, 24570036, 25450293]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25450293, 24570036] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Kazumasa Ohkuma and Hirokazu Urabe for helpful discussion; Masanori Oda, Genki Sahashi, Ryota Yokoyama and Shoichiro Yamamoto for their help with fieldwork; and Kaori Nakahata for help with fish measurement in the laboratory.

Living cells of C. rhomboideo-elliptica were found in five Yunnan Plateau lakes in 1957, but cells were restricted to Lake Fuxian in 2005. Its absolute abundance fluctuated from low to high to low. Our study suggests that nutrient concentrations correlate with C. rhomboideo-elliptica's s abundance and survival. We infer that the disappearance of C. rhomboideo-elliptica in some lakes may be due to increased nutrient concentrations and the species may be indicators of low nutrients.

This morphological change was likely due to higher nutrient concentrations or to the increase in temperature, or a combination of the two.","[Li, Yan-ling; Gong, Zhi-jun; Shen, Ji] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Li, YL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","ylli@niglas.ac.cn","Julius, Matthew L/M-1302-2014","Julius, Matthew L/0000-0003-1693-4644","National Basic Research Program of China [2010CB950201]; National Environmental Protection Administration, and public service industrial special research [200909048]; CAS [KZCX2-EW-QN312]; NIGLAS [NIGLAS 2011KXJ-02]; National Sciences Foundation of China [40972114, 41072267, 41072132]","National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); National Environmental Protection Administration, and public service industrial special research; CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences); NIGLAS; National Sciences Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the projects of the National Basic Research Program of China (2010CB950201), National Environmental Protection Administration, and public service industrial special research (200909048), the project of CAS (KZCX2-EW-QN312), the project of NIGLAS (NIGLAS 2011KXJ-02), and the National Sciences Foundation of China (Grant no. 40972114, 41072267, 41072132).

In ectotherms, higher metabolic rates from warming temperatures can beneficially speed metabolism and development. If compounded by chronic, sublethal pollution, additional resource demands for elimination or detoxification may limit their ability to cope with rising temperaturesthe toxicant-induced climate susceptibility hypothesis. In outdoor bioassays, using natural lake water as the background, the authors investigated the development of a model ectotherm in 6 levels of Cd, Cu, and Pb mixtures and 3 thermal regimes of diel temperature fluctuations: ambient, +1.5 degrees C, and +2.5 degrees C. Warming had no effect on wild-caught Cope's gray tree frog (Hyla chrysoscelis) until metals concentrations were approximately 10-fold of their bioavailable chronic criterion unit (sums of bioavailable fractions of chronic criteria concentrations). In treatments with 10 bioavailable chronic criterion units and +1.5 degrees C, growth increased. Conversely, in treatments with 28 bioavailable chronic criterion units and maximal +2.5 degrees C warming, growth declined and the body condition of postmetamorphic juveniles at 20d was 34% lower than that of juveniles from background conditions (lake water at ambient temperatures). These findings suggest toxicant-induced climate susceptibility with long-term latent effects on the juvenile life stage. Sublethal contaminants can intensify the impact on aquatic ectotherms at the most conservative levels of predicted global warming over the next century. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:1872-1882.

To gain a better understanding of the impact of fluctuating temperatures, we investigated the effects of increased temperature variation on Phanaeus vindex dung beetles across levels of biological organization. Specifically, we hypothesized that increased temperature variation is energetically demanding. We predicted that thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and energetic reserves would be reduced with increasing fluctuation. To test this, we examined the responses of dung beetles to constant (20 degrees C), low fluctuation (20 +/- 5 degrees C), or high fluctuation (20 +/- 12 degrees C) temperature treatments using respirometry, assessment of energetic reserves and HPLC-MS-based metabolomics. We found no significant differences in metabolic rate or energetic reserves, suggesting increased fluctuations were not energetically demanding. To understand why there was no effect of increased amplitude of temperature fluctuation on energetics, we assembled and annotated a de novo transcriptome, finding non-overlapping transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of beetles exposed to different fluctuations. We found that 58 metabolites increased in abundance in both fluctuation treatments, but 15 only did so in response to high-amplitude fluctuations. We found that 120 transcripts were significantly upregulated following acclimation to any fluctuation, but 174 were upregulated only in beetles from the high-amplitude fluctuation treatment. Several differentially expressed transcripts were associated with post-translational modifications to histones that support a more open chromatin structure. Our results demonstrate that acclimation to different temperature fluctuations is distinct and may be supported by increasing transcriptional plasticity. Our results indicate for the first time that histone modifications may underlie rapid acclimation to temperature variation.","[Sheldon, Kimberly S.; Carter, Amanda W.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Padash, Mojgan] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Biol, 730 Van Vleet Oval, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Marshall, Katie E.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Zool, 6270 Univ Blvd, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada","University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of British Columbia","Sheldon, KS (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 569 Dabney Hall, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.","ksheldon@utk.edu","Marshall, Katie/AFK-5175-2022","Padash Barmchi, Mojgan/0000-0003-1505-8953; Marshall, Katie/0000-0002-6991-4957; Sheldon, Kimberly/0000-0002-3215-2223","US National Science Foundation Division of Integrative Organismal Systems [IOS-1930829]","US National Science Foundation Division of Integrative Organismal Systems","This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation Division of Integrative Organismal Systems [IOS-1930829 to K.S.S. and K.E.M.].",NA,"70","5","5","1","8","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

For both endotherms and ectotherms, temperature can affect everything from daily energy budgets to nesting behaviors. For instance, in birds environmental temperature plays a key role in shaping parental incubation behavior and temperatures experienced by embryos. Recent research indicates that temperatures experienced by embryos affect viability and are important in shaping fitness-related traits in young birds, sparking renewed interest in relationships among environmental factors, parental incubation behavior, and incubation temperature. Incubation behavior of birds can be monitored non-invasively by placing thermal probes into the nest and analyzing temperature fluctuations that occur as parents attend and leave the nest (on- and off-bouts, respectively). When other measures of temperature (e.g., ambient air or operative temperature) are collected simultaneously with incubation temperature it is possible to compare shifts in behavior with environmental changes. To improve analysis of incubation behavior using these large thermal data sets we developed a program, NestIQ, that uses machine learning to guide parameter optimization allowing it to track the behavior of diverse species. NestIQ's algorithm was tested using six species incubating in lab or field scenarios, that exhibit unique incubation patterns. This stand-alone and open source software is operated through a graphical user interface (i.e., no user programming is required) that provides important behavioral and thermal output statistics. Further, measures of environmental temperature can be imported alongside nest temperature into the program, which then reports various attributes of environmental temperature during shifts in parental behavior. This program will improve the ability of avian ecologists to interpret a critical parental care behavior that can be used across diverse incubation scenarios and species. Although specifically designed for quantifying avian incubation, NestIQ has the potential for broader applications, including basking and nesting behaviors of non-avian reptiles in relation to ambient temperature.","[Hawkins, Wayne D.] Univ Michigan, Life Sci Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hawkins, Wayne D.] Univ Michigan, Dept Mol Cellular & Dev Biol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hawkins, Wayne D.; DuRant, Sarah E.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville","DuRant, SE (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Biol Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.","sedurant@uark.edu","","","","","",NA,"33","1","1","3","9","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","AUG 28","2020","15","8","",NA,"",NA,"","","e0236925","10.1371/journal.pone.0236925","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236925","","","13","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","NK7YA","32857761","gold, Green Published","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000566947200061","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A nocturnal elevation of thermal tolerance was observed in all the groups. Pineal removal resulted in a highly significant (P<0.001) increase of CTM. Additionally, pinealectomy abolished the normal diurnal cycle in CTM or dampened its amplitude considerably. In another experiment the long-term effect of pinealectomy on thermal tolerance was determined in sham-Px and Pr fishes.

The nonlinear relationship between temperature and biological processes means that fluctuating temperatures lead to physiological, life history, and ecological consequences for ectothermic insects that diverge from those predicted from constant temperatures. Fluctuating temperatures that remain within permissive temperature ranges generally improve performance. By contrast, those which extend to stressful temperatures may have either positive impacts, allowing repair of damage accrued during exposure to thermal extremes, or negative impacts from cumulative damage during successive exposures. We discuss the mechanisms underlying these differing effects. Fluctuating temperatures could be used to enhance or weaken insects in applied rearing programs, and any prediction of insect performance in the field-including models of climate change or population performance-must account for the effect of fluctuating temperatures.","[Colinet, Herve; Renault, David] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6553, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Sinclair, Brent J.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Vernon, Philippe] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6553, F-35380 Paimpont, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Rennes 1; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Rennes 1","Colinet, H (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6553, F-35042 Rennes, France.","herve.colinet@univ-rennes1.fr; bsincla7@uwo.ca; philippe.vernon@univ-rennes1.fr; david.renault@univ-rennes1.fr","colinet, hervé/K-8768-2019; Colinet, hervé/B-3677-2019; Vernon, Philippe/A-9019-2010","Colinet, hervé/0000-0002-8806-3107; Vernon, Philippe/0000-0002-6237-7511; Sinclair, Brent/0000-0002-8191-9910; RENAULT, David/0000-0003-3644-1759","","","",NA,"124","425","433","8","298","ANNUAL REVIEWS","PALO ALTO","4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA","0066-4170","1545-4487","978-0-8243-0160-6","ANNU REV ENTOMOL","Annu.

There is great interest in whether organisms that experience greater thermal variability can gain metabolic or tolerance advantages through phenotypic plasticity. We compared thermal tolerance and routine aerobic metabolism of Convict cichlid acclimated for 2 weeks to constant 20 degrees C, constant 30 degrees C, or a daily cycle of 20 -> 30 degrees C (1.7 degrees C/h). Acute routine mass-specific oxygen consumption ((M) over dotO(2)) and critical thermal maxima/minima (CTMax/CTMin) were compared between groups, with cycle-acclimated fish sampled from the daily minimum (20 degrees C, 0900 h) and maximum (30 degrees C, 1600 h). Cycle-acclimated fish demonstrated statistically similar CTMax at the daily minimum and maximum (39.0 degrees C, 38.6 degrees C) but distinct CTMin values, with CTMin 2.4 degrees C higher for fish sampled from the daily 30 degrees C maximum (14.8 degrees C) compared to the daily 20 degrees C minimum (12.4 degrees C). Measured acutely at 30 degrees C, (M) over dotO(2) decreased with increasing acclimation temperature; 20 degrees C acclimated fish had an 85% higher average (M) over dotO(2) than 30 degrees C acclimated fish. Similarly, acute (M) over dotO(2) at 20 degrees C was 139% higher in 20 degrees C acclimated fish compared to 30 degrees C acclimated fish. Chronic (M) over dotO(2) was measured in separate fish continually across the 20 -> 30 degrees C daily cycle for all 3 acclimation groups. Chronic MO2 responses were very similar between groups between average individual hourly values, as temperatures increased or decreased (1.7 degrees C/h). Acute (M) over dotO(2) and thermal tolerance responses highlight classic trends, but dynamic, chronic trials suggest acclimation history has little effect on the relative change in oxygen consumption during a thermal cycle. Our results strongly suggest that the minimum and maximum temperatures experienced more strongly influence fish physiology, rather than the thermal cycle itself. This research highlights the importance of collecting data in both cycling and static (constant) thermal conditions, and further research should seek to understand whether ectotherm metabolism does respond uniquely to fluctuating temperatures.","[Cooper, Cassidy J.; Kristan, William B., III; Eme, John] Calif State Univ San Marcos, Dept Biol Sci, 333 S Twin Oaks Valley Rd, San Marcos, CA USA; [Cooper, Cassidy J.] Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","California State University System; California State University San Marcos; University of California System; University of California Davis","Cooper, CJ (corresponding author), Calif State Univ San Marcos, Dept Biol Sci, 333 S Twin Oaks Valley Rd, San Marcos, CA USA.;Cooper, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","cjcooper@ucdavis.edu; wkristan@csusm.edu; jeme@csusm.edu","","Eme, John/0000-0001-5693-4812; Cooper, Cassidy/0000-0002-6700-9494","CSUSM startup funds","CSUSM startup funds","CSUSM startup funds to JE.",NA,"72","0","0","1","10","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0174-1578","1432-136X","","J COMP PHYSIOL B","J.

On the example of Daphnia, we experimentally proved the assumption that the decrease in the motor activity of the ectotherms in the selected temperature range is a behaviour mechanism typical for thermal selection. The experiment was conducted on the offspring of one parthenogenetic female (pure line) of a laboratory culture maintained over several years at room temperature. The Daphnia individuals had been beforehand acclimated over several generations to 23.4 degrees C, and then were placed in a thermogradient apparatus. The control individuals were maintained at room temperature. The final temperature preference was determined using the so-called chronic method, when the tested organisms are maintained in a thermogradient apparatus over several days. The positions of the Daphnia individuals were recorded daily during 24 days. As a parameter which would characterize the motor activity of Daphnia, we used the parameter of average relative shifting, which was calculated as a difference (in cm) between the position they were found in two sequential records, divided by time (in min) between these records. Over the first 3 days, in the conditions of the temperature gradient, the Daphnia mostly selected heightened temperatures (24-28 degrees C). During the period from the 4th to 24th day, 74% of the Daphnia selected the range of 1823 degrees C and 85% -17-24 degrees C. Thus, the range of the ultimate selected temperatures decreased by 4 degrees C compared to the initially selected temperatures and enlarged by 3 degrees C towards the lower temperatures. In the thermogradient apparatus, the parthenogenetic females had the lowest value of the mean relative movement. In the control, at room temperature, this parameter of the adults was by 43% higher compared to the gradient. The pattern of the dynamic of the indicator in both variants of the experiment was similar for the periods and phases of fluctuations. With the juveniles the value of the parameter of mean relative shifting in the gradient was higher by 40% compared to the adult Daphnia, but close to the parameter of the adults in the control. We determined a relationship between the juveniles selecting the higher temperatures and higher mean relative shifting, which indicates a relationship between the behavioural selective reaction of juvenile Daphnia and general physiological condition of their organism. During the absence of the temperature gradient, the Daphnia were observed to show symmetry in their motor reaction. Occurrence of the asymmetry of the motor reaction of the Daphnia in the condition of the thermogradient, manifesting in the prevalence of shifting to lower or higher temperatures, can indicate more clearly manifested search reaction in the condition of a non-uniform environment.","[Verbitsky, V.

Temperature is often higher in recently burned forests owing to increased light penetration through the open understory. Because physiological processes are sensitive to temperature in ectotherms, we expected fire maintained forests to improve the suitability of the thermal environment for turtles, and for turtles to seasonally associate with the most thermally-optimal habitats. Using a laboratory thermal gradient, we determined the thermal preference range (T-set) of eastern box turtles, Terrapene carolina, to be 27-31 degrees C. Physical models simulating the body temperatures experienced by turtles in the field revealed that surface environments in a fire maintained longleaf pine forest were 3 degrees C wanner than adjacent unburned mixed hardwood/pine forests, but the fire-maintained forest was never of superior thermal quality owing to wider T-e fluctuations above T-set, and exposure to extreme and potentially lethal temperatures. Radiotracked turtles using fire-managed longleaf pine forests maintained shell temperatures (T-s) approximately 2 degrees C above those at a nearby unburned forest, but we observed only moderate seasonal changes in habitat use which were inconsistent with thermoregulatory behavior. We conclude that turtles were not responding strongly to the thermal heterogeneity generated by fire in our system, and that other aspects of the environment are likely more important in shaping habitat associations.","[Roe, John H.; Wild, Kristoffer H.; Hall, Carlisha A.] Univ North Carolina Pembroke, Dept Biol, Pembroke, NC 28372 USA","University of North Carolina","Roe, JH (corresponding author), Univ North Carolina Pembroke, Dept Biol, Pembroke, NC 28372 USA.","john.roe@uncp.edu; kristofferwild@icloud.com; cah028@bravemail.uncp.edu","Hall, Carlisha/AAD-6674-2019","","Lucille Stickel Fund; North Carolina Herpetological Society; Pembroke Undergraduate Research Center; UNCP Teaching and Learning Center; UNCP Biology Department; UNC Pembroke RISE program under the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences Grant [5R25GM077634]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [R25GM077634] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Lucille Stickel Fund; North Carolina Herpetological Society; Pembroke Undergraduate Research Center; UNCP Teaching and Learning Center; UNCP Biology Department; UNC Pembroke RISE program under the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences Grant; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))","We would like to thank C.

Air-breathing ectotherms show wider thermal tolerances, since they can take advantage of the higher availability of oxygen in air than in water. Bimodal species move from aquatic to aerial media and switch between habitats in response to environmental variations such as cyclical or anomalous temperature fluctuations. Here we tested the prediction that bimodal species cope better with thermal stress than truly aquatic species using the crab Pachygrapsus marmoratus as a model species. When in water, oxygen consumption rates of P. marmoratus acutely rise during warming. Beyond a temperature threshold of 23 degrees C the crab's aerobic metabolism in air remains lower than in water. In parallel, the haemolymph oxygen partial pressure of submerged animals progressive decreases during warming, while it remains low but constant during emersion. Our results demonstrate the ability of a bimodal breathing ectotherm to extend its thermal tolerance during air-breathing, suggesting that there are temperature-related physiological benefits during the evolution of the bimodal life style.","[Fusi, Marco; Daffonchio, Daniele] KAUST, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Fusi, Marco; Cannicci, Stefano] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Cannicci, Stefano] Univ Hong Kong, Swire Inst Marine Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Cannicci, Stefano] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Biol Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Mostert, Bruce] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Poertner, Hans-Otto; Giomi, Folco] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Dept Integrat Ecophysiol, Bremerhaven, Germany","King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; University of Florence; University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; Rhodes University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research","Giomi, F (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Dept Integrat Ecophysiol, Bremerhaven, Germany.","folcog@gmail.com","Cannicci, Stefano/N-8512-2019; Daffonchio, Daniele/AAF-4922-2019; Pörtner, Hans-O./K-9429-2016","Cannicci, Stefano/0000-0002-6544-0213; Daffonchio, Daniele/0000-0003-0947-925X; Pörtner, Hans-O./0000-0001-6535-6575","Italian MIUR funds; SP3-People (Marie Curie) IRSES Project CREC [247514]; Intra-European Fellowship [221017]; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","Italian MIUR funds(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); SP3-People (Marie Curie) IRSES Project CREC; Intra-European Fellowship; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology)","The study was supported by Italian MIUR funds (Cannicci ex 60%) and the SP3-People (Marie Curie) IRSES Project CREC (no. 247514).

Such plasticity can permit local adaptation but it can also be constrained by physiological and behavioral mechanisms. Here, we explore how different temperature regimes along a latitudinal gradient spanning the natural range of a species of fiddler crab may affect the ability of crabs to change color rapidly in response to acute changes of temperature. Uca pugilator populations from New York (NY), North Carolina (NC) and Florida (FL) were exposed in air to 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C and carapace shade intensity (from dark to light color) and contrast was recorded. In general, individuals darkened when exposed to cold conditions, and lightened when exposed to warm conditions. Males from different populations differed in the magnitude of response to temperature, but had similar directional changes in shade (dark under cold conditions and light under warm conditions) suggesting differences among populations in the ability to change color. Females showed similar directional changes but there were no differences among populations. Differential responses of crabs to temperature suggest that crabs have local physiological adaptations and can acclimate quickly to withstand fluctuating or extreme temperatures.

Measurements of the rate of oxygen consumption (Vo(2)) in the field are usually impractical, so several studies of endotherms have utilized heart rate (f(H)) as a correlate of Vo(2) because of the tight relationship that often exists between the two variables. There have been several reports, however, where the relationship between f(H) and Vo(2) changes or disassociates under different physiological or psychological circumstances. This may be further confounded in ectothermic vertebrates, which experience relatively large fluctuations in body temperature (T-b). 2. The aim of the present study was to characterize in Rosenberg's Goanna (Varanus rosenbergi) the relationship that exists between T-b, f(H) and Vo(2) at rest and at different levels of exercise, during periods of heating and cooling, and following ingestion of a meal. 3. The combinations of T-b and f(H) were accurate at predicting Vo(2) of animals at different levels of exercise and recovery, and during the postprandial period. 4. Predictions of Vo(2) became less reliable during periods of relatively rapid heating when f(H) and blood flow increase for thermoregulatory purposes with no associated increase in Vo(2). To counter this, f(H) was excluded from the prediction equation when the rate of heating exceeded 20% of the predicted mass-dependent maximum attainable rate, and Vo(2) was predicted using T-b alone. 5. The resultant Vo(2) prediction equation was used to estimate Vo(2) of seven animals that were allowed to thermoregulate behaviourally, and the mean predicted Vo(2) (Vo(2pred)) was not significantly different from the mean measured Vo(2) (Vo(2meas)) for fasting or postprandial lizards.","La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Adaptat & Evolutionary Resp Physiol Lab, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; Univ Birmingham, Sch Biosci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England","La Trobe University; University of Birmingham","Clark, TD (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Adaptat & Evolutionary Resp Physiol Lab, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.","timothy.clark@adelaide.edu.au","Clark, Timothy Darren/K-7129-2012","Clark, Timothy Darren/0000-0001-8738-3347","","","",NA,"52","25","26","0","17","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","OXFORD","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","0269-8463","","","FUNCT ECOL","Funct.

The upper lethal temperature of this species ranged between 32 degrees C and 38 degrees C, depending on the method and exposure time; however, temperatures as low as 28 degrees C resulted in slowed growth compared with the control groups. In LTM trials, we increased temperatures 0.3 degrees C/min and death occurred at 36.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C (mean +/- SE) for fish (37-49 turn total length) acclimated to 30 degrees C and at 36.4 +/- 0.07 degrees C for fish acclimated to 25 degrees C. In CLM trials, temperatures were increased more slowly (1 degrees C/d), allowing fish to acclimate. Mean temperature at death was 33.4 +/- 0.1 degrees C for fish 25-35 mm and 32.9 +/- 0.4 degrees C for fish 45-50 turn. In the ACE experiment with static temperatures, we exposed fish for 30 d to four constant temperatures. No fish (20-40 mm) survived beyond 30 d at 32 degrees C and the 30-d temperature lethal to 50% of the test animals was 30.6 degrees C. Growth at static 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C was slower than growth at 25 degrees C, suggesting that fish were stressed at sublethal temperatures. In ACE trials with diel temperature fluctuations of 4, 6, and 10 degrees C and a 32 degrees C peak temperature, over 80% of fish (2040 turn) survived 30 d. Although brief exposures to 32 degrees C were not lethal, the growth of fish in the three fluctuating-temperature treatments was significantly less than the growth at the ambient temperature (25-29 degrees C).

We report on a decade-long study of free-ranging sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), exposed to an increasing mean mating season temperature and with known operational sex ratios. We assessed year-to-year variation in sexual selection on body size and postcopulatory sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Higher temperature was not linked to strength of sexual selection on body mass, but operational sex ratio (more males) did increase the strength of sexual selection on body size. Elevated temperature increased mating rate and number of sires per clutch with positive effects on offspring fitness. In years when the quality of a female's partners was more variable (in standard errors of a male sexual ornament), clutches showed less multiple paternity. This agrees with prior laboratory trials in which females exercised stronger cryptic female choice when male quality varied more. An increased number of sires contributing to within-clutch paternity decreased the risk of having malformed offspring. Ultimately, such variation may contribute to highly dynamic and shifting selection mosaics in the wild, with potential implications for the evolutionary ecology of mating systems and population responses to rapidly changing environmental conditions.","[Olsson, Mats; Madsen, Thomas; Ujvari, Beata] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Olsson, Mats] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Zool, SE-41390 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Wapstra, Erik] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Schwartz, Tonia] Iowa State Univ, Interdept Genet Program, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Madsen, Thomas] Hungarian Acad Sci, Anim Ecol Res Grp, Budapest, Hungary; [Madsen, Thomas] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Uller, Tobias] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England","University of Sydney; University of Gothenburg; University of Tasmania; Iowa State University; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Ecological Research; University of Sydney; University of Oxford","Olsson, M (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Heydon Lawrence Bldg,AO8, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.","molsson@uow.edu.au; Erik.Wapstra@utas.edu.au; Schwartz@iastate.edu; Thomas.Madsen@zoolekol.lund.se; beatau@uow.edu.au; tobias.uller@zoo.ox.ac.uk","Olsson, Mats/AAK-5565-2021; Ujvari, Beata/L-7541-2019; Ujvari, Beata/K-8722-2012; Wapstra, Erik/J-7482-2014","Olsson, Mats/0000-0002-4130-1323; Ujvari, Beata/0000-0003-2391-2988; Ujvari, Beata/0000-0003-2391-2988; Wapstra, Erik/0000-0002-2050-8026; Schwartz, Tonia/0000-0002-7712-2810; Madsen, Thomas/0000-0002-0998-8372","Swedish Science Council; Australian Research Council","Swedish Science Council; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","We thank the Swedish Science Council (MO), and the Australian Research Council (MO, EW) for financial support.

It is therefore possible to construct predictive models of development that rely solely on temperature, which have applications in a range of biological fields. Here, we leverage a reference series of development stages for embryos of the turtle Chelydra serpentina, which was described at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C. The reference series acts to map each distinct developmental stage onto embryonic age (in days) at 20 degrees C. By extension, an embryo taken from any given incubation environment, once staged, can be assigned an equivalent age at 20 degrees C. We call this concept Equivalent Development, as it maps the development stage of an embryo incubated at a given temperature to its equivalent age at a reference temperature. In the laboratory, we used the concept of Equivalent Development to estimate development rate of embryos of C. serpentina across a series of constant temperatures. Using these estimates of development rate, we created a thermal performance curve measured in units of Equivalent Development (TPCED). We then used the TPCED to predict developmental stage of embryos in several natural turtle nests across six years. We found that 85% of the variation of development stage in natural nests could be explained. Further, we compared the predictive accuracy of the model based on the TPCED to the predictive accuracy of a degree-day model, where development is assumed to be linearly related to temperature and the amount of accumulated heat is summed over time. Information theory suggested that the model based on the TPCED better describes variation in developmental stage in wild nests than the degree-day model. We suggest the concept of Equivalent Development has several strengths and can be broadly applied. In particular, studies on temperature-dependent sex determination may be facilitated by the concept of Equivalent Development, as development age maps directly onto the developmental series of the organism, allowing critical periods of sex determination to be delineated without invasive sampling, even under fluctuating temperature.","[Rollinson, Njal; Massey, Melanie D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Rollinson, Njal] Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, 33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E8, Canada; [Holt, Sarah M.; Nancekivell, E.

Despite the importance of mating rate as a determinant of the intensity of male/female conflict over reproduction, the effects of ecological factors such as thermal environment on this process are poorly understood. We examined how temperature affects female remating rate in Drosophila melanogaster. The mating behaviour of D. melanogaster shows a circadian rhythm, and we partitioned thermal environment effects into those experienced at the point of courtship and those experienced outside courtship bouts. Temperature during and outside courtship both affected female remating rate, and did so in an approximately additive fashion. We found that female remating rate was more sensitive to thermal environment at the point of courtship than that encountered outside courtship periods. Elevation of temperature during courtship increased male courtship intensity, and we hypothesize that this directly increased a female's likelihood of remating. Our results highlight the importance of thermal conditions during and after courtship in determining mating rate in Drosophila and we discuss its implication for rates of polyandry in natural populations in terms of daily, seasonal and spatial variation, and changes that may be associated with climate change.

The first issue is the use of annual average temperature as an input to a non-linear function describing methane production. As expected based on Jensen's inequality, the MCF calculated based on annual average temperature is always an underestimate. In regions with large intra-annual temperature ranges, such as temperate climates, the underestimation can exceed 30%. A second issue is the lack of consideration for volatile solids retention time. Future updates to the IPCC methodology should therefore account for intra-annual temperature regime and retention time-not simply annual average temperature.

Advanced emergence is widely reported in high-latitude ectotherms, but a significant number of species exhibit delayed, or no change in, emergence. Here we present a mechanistic theoretical framework that reconciles these disparate observations and predicts population-level phenological patterns based solely on data on temperature responses of the underlying life history traits. Our model, parameterized with data from insects at different latitudes, shows that peak abundance occurs earlier in the year when warming increases the mean environmental temperature, but is delayed when warming increases the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations. We find that warming does not necessarily lead to a longer activity period in high-latitude species because it elevates summer temperatures above the upper limit for reproduction and development. Our findings both confirm and confound expectations for ectotherm species affected by climate warming: an increase in the mean temperature is more detrimental to low-latitude species adapted to high mean temperatures and low-amplitude seasonal fluctuations; an increase in seasonal fluctuations is more detrimental to high-latitude species adapted to low mean temperatures and high-amplitude fluctuations.","[Scranton, Katherine; Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Scranton, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","katherine.scranton@ucla.edu","","Scranton, Katherine/0000-0002-7656-676X","","","",NA,"60","55","61","6","69","NATL ACAD SCIENCES","WASHINGTON","2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA","0027-8424","","","P NATL ACAD SCI USA","Proc.

Artificial alterations of environmental fluctuations can have negative consequences for life history traits, including lifespan. In laboratory studies of aging, the role of fluctuating temperature is usually overlooked and we know little of how thermal fluctuation modulates senescence in vertebrates. In this longitudinal study we followed individually-housed turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri, from two thermal regimes; ecologically relevant diel fluctuations (20 degrees C - 35 degrees C) and stable temperature (27.5 degrees C), and compared their survival, growth and reproduction. Fish experiencing fluctuating temperatures had a longer median lifespan but reached smaller asymptotic body size. Within-treatment variation indicated that extended lifespan in fluctuating temperatures was not causally linked to decreased growth rate or smaller body size, but occurred solely due to the effect of thermal fluctuations. Male body size was positively associated with lifespan in stable temperatures but this relationship was disrupted in fluctuating thermal regimes. Females exposed to fluctuating temperatures effectively compensated egg production for their smaller size. Thus, there was no difference in absolute fecundity between thermal regimes and body-size corrected fecundity was higher in females in fluctuating temperatures. Overall, despite a brief exposure to sub-optimal thermal conditions during fluctuations, fluctuating temperature had a positive effect on survival and reproduction. These results suggest that the expression of life history traits and their associations under stable temperatures are a poor representation of the relationships obtained from ecologically relevant thermal fluctuations.","[Zak, Jakub; Reichard, Martin] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Kvetna 8, Brno 60365, Czech Republic; [Zak, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12800, Czech Republic; [Reichard, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Brno, Czech Republic","Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Biology of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Masaryk University Brno","Reichard, M (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Kvetna 8, Brno 60365, Czech Republic.","reichard@ivb.cz","Žák, Jakub/ABG-4831-2021; Reichard, Martin/C-6563-2009; Žák, Jakub/S-3375-2017","Žák, Jakub/0000-0003-2845-8323; Reichard, Martin/0000-0002-9306-0074; Žák, Jakub/0000-0003-2845-8323","Czech Science Foundation [1901781S]; SVV [260571/2020]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); SVV","This study was supported by Czech Science Foundation grant (1901781S).

Temperature is one of the primary environmental drivers of the distribution of species, and particularly high temperatures challenge physiological processes by disruption of cellular homoeostasis. This exerts selection on organisms to maintain cellular homoeostasis by adaptive physiological and/or behavioural responses. 2. The social spider Stegodyphus dumicola occurs across several climate zones in Southern Africa, and populations experience high and variable temperatures, suggesting a wide temperature niche, or alternatively that populations respond with plastic or locally adapted responses to temperature. Using a common garden design, we investigated complementary adaptive heat responses (behavioural thermoregulation and cuticle wax composition) in individuals from warmer and cooler locations. 3. The spiders exhibited higher temperature tolerance than most ectotherms (CTmax almost 49 degrees C), with the individuals from warmer locations showing the highest tolerance. Analyses of cuticle wax revealed chemical compositions consistent with a higher melting temperature (e.g. increased chain length and lower occurrence of branching) and therefore improved waterproofing in spiders originating from warmer locations and acclimated at a higher temperature, as expected if local temperature drives changes in the cuticle composition to improve waterproofing. 4. The spiders exhibited a clear behavioural escape response from increasing temperature, with individuals from warmer locations and kept at higher acclimation temperature showing a lower threshold temperature at which this behaviour was triggered, suggesting that this threshold is under natural selection. 5. Our study provides evidence of both local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in physiological and behavioural traits relating to temperature tolerance. Population differences in trait expression suggest local adaptation to different thermal environments, and individuals plastically adjust cuticle wax composition and cooling behaviour in response to temperature changes. 6. The Bogert effect predicts that behavioural thermoregulation may relax selection for physiological adaptations. Our study instead suggests that synergistic of both physiological arid behavioural adaptive traits shape the thermal biology of species. 7. Local adaptation allows existence across different climate zones. Additionally, plasticity in behavioural and physiological traits enables rapid responses to short- term temperature fluctuations within a thermal niche. We show that adaptive and plastic responses act in concert to shape the thermal biology and distribution of species.","[Malmos, Kirsten Gade; Vosegaard, Thomas] Aarhus Univ, Interdisciplinary Nano Sci Ctr iNANO, Aarhus C, Denmark; [Ludeking, Andreas Husted; Aagaard, Anne; Bechsgaard, Jesper; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov; Bilde, Trine] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Aarhus C, Denmark; [Vosegaard, Thomas] Aarhus Univ, Dept Chem, Aarhus C, Denmark","Aarhus University; Aarhus University; Aarhus University","Bilde, T (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Aarhus C, Denmark.","trine.bilde@bio.au.dk","; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov/J-3190-2013; Bilde, Trine/J-2872-2013","Bechsgaard, Jesper/0000-0003-3273-0174; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov/0000-0002-9149-3626; Bilde, Trine/0000-0002-0341-161X; Gade Malmos, Kirsten/0000-0002-4035-9048; Vosegaard, Thomas/0000-0001-5414-4550","Novo Nordisk Fonden [NNF16OC0021110]","Novo Nordisk Fonden(Novo Nordisk Foundation)","Novo Nordisk Fonden, Grant/Award Number: NNF16OC0021110",NA,"64","5","5","2","18","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0269-8463","1365-2435","","FUNCT ECOL","Funct.

The performance of ectotherms integrated over time depends in part on the position and shape of the distribution of body temperatures (T-b) experienced during activity. For several complementary reasons, physiological ecologists have long expected that T-b distributions during activity should have a long left tail (left-skewed), but only infrequently have they quantified the magnitude and direction of T-b skewness in nature. 2. To evaluate whether left-skewed T-b distributions are general for diurnal desert lizards, we compiled and analysed T-b (Sigma = 9,023 temperatures) from our own prior studies of active desert lizards in three continents (25 species in Western Australia, 10 in the Kalahari Desert of Africa and 10 species in western North America). We gathered these data over several decades, using standardized techniques. 3. Many species showed significantly left-skewed T-b distributions, even when records were restricted to summer months. However, magnitudes of skewness were always small, such that mean T-b were never more than 1 degrees C lower than median T-b. The significance of T-b skewness was sensitive to sample size, and power tests reinforced this sensitivity. 4. The magnitude of skewness was not obviously related to phylogeny, desert, body size or median body temperature. Moreover, a formal phylogenetic analysis is inappropriate because geography and phylogeny are confounded (i.e. are highly collinear). 5. Skewness might be limited if lizards pre-warm inside retreats before emerging in the morning, emerge only when operative temperatures are high enough to speed warming to activity T-b, or if cold lizards are especially wary and difficult to spot or catch. Telemetry studies may help evaluate these possibilities.","[Huey, Raymond B.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Pianka, Eric R.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Integrat Biol, Austin, TX 78712 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin","Huey, RB (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","hueyrb@uw.edu","Huey, Raymond/F-1597-2010","","National Geographic Society; National Science Foundation [IOS 1155325]; Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History; John Simon Guggenheim Foundation; Senior Fulbright Research Scholarship; Australian-American Educational Foundation; University Research Institute of the Graduate School at The University of Texas at Austin; Denton A.

Common to coral reef flats, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) possesses physiological adaptations to hypoxic and hypercapnic conditions, such as those experienced on reef flats, but little is known regarding the thermal strategies used by these sharks. We investigated whether H. ocellatum uses behavioural thermoregulation (i.e., movement to occupy thermally favourable microhabitats) or tolerates the broad range of temperatures experienced on the reef flat. Using an automated shuttlebox system, we determined the preferred temperature of H. ocellatum under controlled laboratory conditions and then compared this preferred temperature to 6 months of in situ environmental and body temperatures of individual H. ocellatum across the Heron Island reef flat. The preferred temperature of H. ocellatum under controlled conditions was 20.7 +/- 1.5 degrees C, but the body temperatures of individual H. ocellatum on the Heron Island reef flat mirrored environmental temperatures regardless of season or month. Despite substantial temporal variation in temperature on the Heron Island reef flat (15-34 degrees C during 2017), there was a lack of spatial variation in temperature across the reef flat between sites or microhabitats. This limited spatial variation in temperature creates a low-quality thermal habitat limiting the ability of H. ocellatum to behaviourally thermoregulate. Behavioural thermoregulation is assumed in many shark species, but it appears that H. ocellatum may utilize other physiological strategies to cope with extreme temperature fluctuations on coral reef flats. While H. ocellatum appears to be able to tolerate acute exposure to temperatures well outside of their preferred temperature, it is unclear how this, and other, species will cope as temperatures continue to rise and approach their critical thermal limits. Understanding how species will respond to continued warming and the strategies they may use will be key to predicting future populations and assemblages.","[Nay, Tiffany J.; Longbottom, Rohan J.; Rummer, Jodie L.; Hoey, Andrew S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Gervais, Connor R.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Johansen, Jacob L.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Steffensen, John F.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Sect, Helsingor, Denmark","James Cook University; Macquarie University; University of Hawaii System; University of Copenhagen","Nay, TJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.","tiffany.nay@my.jcu.edu.au","; Steffensen, John Fleng/F-6778-2010; Rummer, Jodie/A-6524-2015","Hoey, Andrew/0000-0002-4261-5594; Steffensen, John Fleng/0000-0002-4477-8039; johansen, jacob/0000-0002-2912-2146; Rummer, Jodie/0000-0001-6067-5892","ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University","ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University(Australian Research Council)","Funding was provided by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University (A.S.H.) and the #WalkingSharks crowdfunding campaign.",NA,"68","7","7","3","21","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0022-1112","1095-8649","","J FISH BIOL","J.

Yet, information in this regard is biased towards some habitat types, landscapes, and organisms. Here, we present a 2-year comparative study of the microclimatic properties (temperature, relative humidity, and their fluctuation) of three cavity types (nest boxes, cavities in bridges, and burrows in sandy cliffs) in an arid environment. We found marked and consistent months-long differences in microclimate among the three cavity types. Nest boxes were colder than the other cavity types, with temperature oscillations being an order of magnitude higher than in other cavity types. In contrast, microclimate was very stable in burrows and cavities in bridges, the former being generally warmer and drier than the latter. We also discuss the biological implications of microclimatic conditions and its variation in different cavity types by presenting two case studies, namely the temperature-humidity index and water vapor pressure during the hatching period of an endotherm and the chilling period during the diapause of an ectotherm ectoparasite. We stress the need for comparative studies of the same organisms subjected to different microclimates given the important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications.","[Amat-Valero, M.; Calero-Torralbo, M.

Here, we examine the key - but often biologically unreasonable - assumptions underlying this approach; for example, that physiology and thermal regimes are invariant over ontogeny, space and time, and also that TPCs are independent of previously experienced T-b. We show how a critical consideration of these assumptions can lead to biologically useful hypotheses and experimental designs. For example, rather than assuming that TPCs are fixed during ontogeny, one can measure TPCs for each major life stage and incorporate these into stage-specific ecological models to reveal the life stage most likely to be vulnerable to climate change. Our overall goal is to explicitly examine the assumptions underlying the integration of TPCs with T-b, to develop a framework within which empiricists can place their work within these limitations, and to facilitate the application of thermal physiology to understanding the biological implications of climate change.","[Sinclair, Brent J.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Marshall, Katie E.; Harley, Christopher D.

Using Drosophila melanogaster as an animal model, we examined how different thermal environments affected the shape of the performance curve and their parameters. We measured the climbing speed as a measure of locomotor performance in adult flies and tested the ontogenetic and transgenerational effects of thermal environment on TPC shape. Parents and offspring were reared at 28 +/- 0oC (28C), 28 +/- 4oC (28V), and 30 +/- 0oC (30C). We found that both, environmental thermal variability (28V) and high temperature (30C) experienced during early ontogeny shaped the fruit fly TPC sensitivity. Flies reared at variable thermal environments shifted the TPC to the right and increased heat tolerance. Flies held at high and constant temperature exhibited lower maximum performance than flies reared at the variable thermal environment. Furthermore, these effects were extended to the next generation. The parental thermal environment had a significative effect on TPC and its parameters. Indeed, flies reared at 28V whose parents were held at a high and constant temperature (30C) had a lower heat tolerance than F1 of flies reared at 28C or 28V. Also, offspring of flies reared at variable thermal environment (28V) reached the maximum performance at a higher temperature than offspring of flies reared at 28C or 30C. Consequently, since TPC parameters are not fixed, we suggest cautiousness when using TPCs to predict the impact of climate change on natural populations.","[Cavieres, Grisel; Alruiz, Jose M.; Medina, Nadia R.; Bogdanovich, Jose M.; Bozinovic, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Dept Ecol, Fac Ciencias Biol, Santiago, Chile; [Cavieres, Grisel] Inst Argentino Invest Zonas Aridas, CONICET, Grp Invest Biodiversidad, CCT Mendoza, Mendoza, Argentina","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","Cavieres, G (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Appl Ecol & Sustainabil CAPES, Dept Ecol, Fac Ciencias Biol, Santiago, Chile.","gcavieres@uc.cl","Cavieres, Grisel/AAU-5470-2021","Alruiz, Jose/0000-0002-5090-4134; Bozinovic, Francisco/0000-0003-3870-9624; Cavieres, Grisel/0000-0003-4230-2923","Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [FB0002-2014]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [1170017, 3140450]","Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT)","Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: FB0002-2014 line 3 to FB; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 1170017 and 3140450",NA,"96","17","18","1","18","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Lizard activity seems to be restraint during the early afternoon due high environmental temperatures. However, both, the high safety margin and warming tolerance suggest that the expected increase in environmental temperatures due to global warming (IPCC report in 2018) would not threaten, but indeed enhance locomotor performance in this population.","[Obregon, Rosa L.; Scolaro, Jose A.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CENPAT, Inst Diversidad & Evoluc Austral, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Obregon, Rosa L.; Scolaro, Jose A.] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Fac Ciencias Nat, Trelew, Argentina; [Ibarguengoytia, Nora R.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, INIBIOMA, Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Medioambiente, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Medina, Marlin] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CIEMEP, Ctr Invest Esquel Montana & Estepa Patagon, Esquel, Argentina","Centro Nacional Patagonico (CENPAT); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","Medina, M (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CIEMEP, Ctr Invest Esquel Montana & Estepa Patagon, Esquel, Argentina.","marlinmedina74@gmail.com","","","Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco [PI 1123]; Universidad Nacional del Comahue (CRUB UNComahue) [04/B196]; Argentinean Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 100271]; Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (FONCyT) [PICT-2014-3100]","Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco; Universidad Nacional del Comahue (CRUB UNComahue); Argentinean Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); Fondo para la Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (FONCyT)(FONCyT)","The authors wish to express their gratitude to J.

These organisms Live in various sulfide-rich habitats, including the hottest part of the hydrothermal environment (i.e. chimneys). They experience transient anoxia, high levels of heavy metals and H2S, natural radioactivity and temperatures ranging from 5 to 80 degrees C which vary greatly with time. The Alvinellidae, as many vent organisms, have developed specific adaptations to cope with this harsh and unstable environment. Enzyme systems are good markers of the adaptation of ectotherms to temperature, which acts on both enzyme kinetics and protein denaturation. We estimated genetic distances between 11 alvinellid species using a data set of allozymes and studied in vitro allozyme thermostabilities of aspartate-amino transferase (AAT), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) and phosphoglucomutase (PGM), which may play a role in orientating aerobic versus anaerobic metabolism pathways, for 8 species using the most common homozygous genotypes. Results show great genetic divergences between species living in distinct microhabitats as well as strong thermostability differences within and between species which also rely on different enzymatic strategies (phenotypic plasticity versus genetic variability). Allelic fitness to temperature in a highly fluctuating environment may explain the high level of polymorphism found in alvinellids and may have also provided sufficient genetic divergence between individuals living in distinct thermal regimes to produce speciation.","IFREMER, CTR BREST, DRO EP, F-29280 PLOUZANE, FRANCE; INST OCEANOG, F-75005 PARIS, FRANCE","Ifremer","JOLLIVET, D (corresponding author), PLYMOUTH MARINE LAB, DEPT MOLEC BIOL, CITADEL HILL, PLYMOUTH PL1 2PB, DEVON, ENGLAND.","","","DELBARRE LADRAT, Christine/0000-0002-0205-3822","","","",NA,"61","42","42","0","11","INTER-RESEARCH","OLDENDORF LUHE","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","0171-8630","","","MAR ECOL PROG SER","Mar.

Yet, the impacts on biodiversity, especially on the invertebrate ectotherms which are dominant in these areas, remain poorly understood. Short-term extreme temperature events, which are growing in frequency, are expected to have profound impacts on high-latitude ectotherms, with native species being less resilient than their alien counterparts. Here, we examined in the laboratory the effects of short periodic exposures to thermal extremes on survival responses of seven native and two non-native invertebrates from the sub-Antarctic Islands. We found that survival of dipterans was significantly reduced under warming exposures, on average having median lethal times (LT50) of about 30 days in control conditions, which declined to about 20 days when exposed to daily short-term maxima of 24 degrees C. Conversely, coleopterans were either not, or were less, affected by the climatic scenarios applied, with predicted LT50 as high as 65 days under the warmest condition (daily exposures at 28 degrees C for 2 h). The native spider Myro kerguelensis was characterized by an intermediate sensitivity when subjected to short-term daily heat maxima. Our results unexpectedly revealed a taxonomic influence, with physiological sensitivity to heat differing between higher level taxa, but not between native and non-native species representing the same higher taxon. The survival of a non-native carabid beetle under the experimentally imposed conditions was very high, but similar to that of native beetles, while native and non-native flies also exhibited very similar sensitivity to warming. As dipterans are a major element of diversity of sub-Antarctic, Arctic and other cold ecosystems, such observations suggest that the increased occurrence of extreme, short-term, thermal events could lead to large-scale restructuring of key terrestrial ecosystem components both in ecosystems protected from and those exposed to the additional impacts of biological invasions.","[Renault, David; Leclerc, Camille; Colleu, Marc-Antoine; Boutet, Aude; Hotte, Hoel; Colinet, Herve] Univ Rennes, CNRS, UMR 6553, ECOBIO,Ecosyst Biodiversite Evolut, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Leclerc, Camille] Aix Marseille Univ, INRAE, UMR Recover, Aix En Provence, France; [Hotte, Hoel] ANSES, Plant Hlth Lab, Nematol Unit, Le Rheu, France; [Chown, Steven L.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Securing Antarcticas Environm Future, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Convey, Peter] British Antarctic Survey, NERC, Cambridge, England; [Convey, Peter] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Zool, Auckland Pk, South Africa","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Rennes 1; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite; Agence Nationale de Securite Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de l'Environnement du Travail (ANSES); Laboratoire de la Sante des Vegetaux; Monash University; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERC British Antarctic Survey; University of Johannesburg","Renault, D (corresponding author), Univ Rennes, CNRS, UMR 6553, ECOBIO,Ecosyst Biodiversite Evolut, F-35000 Rennes, France.","david.renault@univ-rennes1.fr","Leclerc, Camille/AAD-5707-2019; colinet, herve/B-3677-2019; Chown, Steven/H-3347-2011","Leclerc, Camille/0000-0001-5830-1787; colinet, herve/0000-0002-8806-3107; Chown, Steven/0000-0001-6069-5105; , Hoel HOTTE/0000-0002-0605-1154","Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-20-EBI5-0004]; ARC SRIEAS [SR200100005]; British Antarctic Survey; InEE-CNRS; Institut Polaire Francais Paul Emile Victor [IPEV 136 Subanteco]; Natural Environment Research Council","Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR)); ARC SRIEAS(Australian Research Council); British Antarctic Survey; InEE-CNRS; Institut Polaire Francais Paul Emile Victor; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Grant/Award Number: ANR--20--EBI5--0004; ARC SRIEAS, Grant/Award Number: SR200100005; British Antarctic Survey; InEE--CNRS; Institut Polaire Francais Paul Emile Victor, Grant/Award Number: Projet IPEV 136 Subanteco; Natural Environment Research Council",NA,"117","1","1","10","10","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1354-1013","1365-2486","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL","Glob.

In this work, we evaluated and compared the antioxidant capacity and metabolism homeo-stasis of two sea urchins, viz. the temperate species Strongylocentrotus intermedius and the tropical species Tripneustes gratilla, in response to oceanic conditions under a climate change scenario. The two species were treated separately/ jointly by acidic (pH 7.6), thermal (ambient temperature + 3 degrees C), and temperature fluctuating (5 degrees C fluctuations daily) seawater for 28 days. The activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) and the cellular energy allocation in the urchins' gonads were assessed subsequently. Results showed that exposure to OA, OW, and DTC all induced antioxidant responses associated with metabolism imbalance in both S. intermedius and T. gratilla. The physiological adjustments and energy strategies towards exposure of OA, OW, and DTC are species specific, per-haps owing to the different thermal acclimation of species from two latitudes. Moreover, decrease of cellular energy allocation were detected in both species under combined OA, OW, and DTC conditions, indicating unsustainable bio-energetic states. The decrease of cellular energy allocation is weaker in T. gratilla than in S. intermedius, implying higher acclimation capacity to maintain the energy homeostasis in tropical urchins. These results suggest that climate change might affect the population replenishment of the two sea urchins species, especially for the temperate species.","[Zhang, Tianyu; Cao, Ruiwen; Zhang, Qianqian; Qu, Yi; Wang, Qing; Dong, Zhijun; Zhao, Jianmin] Chinese Acad Sci, Muping Coastal Environm Res Stn, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Yantai 264117, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tianyu; Li, Xiao; Cao, Ruiwen; Zhang, Qianqian; Qu, Yi; Wang, Qing; Dong, Zhijun; Zhao, Jianmin] Chinese Acad Sci, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Key Lab Coastal Biol & Biol Resources Utilizat, Yantai 264003, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tianyu; Qu, Yi] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qing; Dong, Zhijun; Zhao, Jianmin] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Ocean Mega Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zhang, QQ; Zhao, JM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Muping Coastal Environm Res Stn, Yantai Inst Coastal Zone Res, Yantai 264117, Peoples R China.","qqzhang@yic.ac.cn; jmzhao@sic.ac.cn","Wang, Qing/O-1991-2013","Wang, Qing/0000-0002-5180-5154; zhang, tianyu/0000-0002-1094-0827","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1406503]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA23050303]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences [2019216]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences","This study was supported by the grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1406503) , the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA23050303) , and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. 2019216) .",NA,"91","1","1","13","23","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0048-9697","1879-1026","","SCI TOTAL ENVIRON","Sci.

Thus, the ability to behaviorally and/or physiologically respond to variation in temperatures is a fundamental requirement for long-term persistence. Studies on thermal biology in ectotherms are typically performed under constant laboratory conditions, which differ markedly from the variation in temperature across time and space in nature. Here, we investigate evolutionary adaptation and environmentally induced plastic responses of Drosophila simulans to no fluctuations (constant), predictable fluctuations or unpredictable fluctuations in temperature. We whole-genome sequenced populations exposed to 20 generations of experimental evolution under the three thermal regimes and examined the proteome after short-term exposure to the same three regimes. We find that unpredictable fluctuations cause the strongest response at both genome and proteome levels. The loci showing evolutionary responses were generally unique to each thermal regime, but a minor overlap suggests either common laboratory adaptation or that some loci were involved in the adaptation to multiple thermal regimes. The evolutionary response, i.e., loci under selection, did not coincide with induced responses of the proteome. Thus, genes under selection in fluctuating thermal environments are distinct from genes important for the adaptive plastic response observed within a generation. This information is key to obtain a better understanding and prediction of the effects of future increases in both mean and variability of temperatures.","[Sorensen, Jesper G.; Manenti, Tommaso; Bechsgaard, Jesper S.; Loeschcke, Volker] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Schou, Mads F.] Lund Univ, Dept Biol, Lund, Sweden; [Kristensen, Torsten N.] Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Aalborg, Denmark","Aarhus University; Lund University; Aalborg University","Sorensen, JG (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Aarhus, Denmark.","jesper.soerensen@bio.au.dk","Schou, Mads Fristrup/J-2148-2014; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov/J-3190-2013","Schou, Mads Fristrup/0000-0001-5521-5269; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov/0000-0002-9149-3626","Graduate School of Science and Technology (GSST) at Science and Technology, Aarhus University; Sapere Aude: DFF-Starting Grant; Independent Research Fund Denmark, Natural Sciences","Graduate School of Science and Technology (GSST) at Science and Technology, Aarhus University; Sapere Aude: DFF-Starting Grant; Independent Research Fund Denmark, Natural Sciences","The study was supported by the Graduate School of Science and Technology (GSST) at Science and Technology, Aarhus University (TM), and by a Sapere Aude: DFF-Starting Grant (JS) and a large frame grant (VL) from the Independent Research Fund Denmark, Natural Sciences.",NA,"68","4","4","2","13","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","1664-8021","","FRONT GENET","Front.

For many ectotherms, including ghost crabs, a major challenge is to remain cool during hot daytime temperatures. This can be achieved by adopting a fossorial lifestyle, taking advantage of thermal refuge afforded by burrows of sufficient depth. Another consideration, often overlooked, is the potential advantage associated with ready access to a thermal energy source (a charging station) when surface temperatures are cooler. Being able to rapidly elevate body temperature during cool periods would enhance the crab's ability to maintain rate processes and carry out essential activities. We have measured ghost crab burrow temperature profiles at two times of the day with contrasting sun exposure (06:00 and 14:00), demonstrating how effective burrow depth (up to a maximum of 40 cm) provides thermal regulation below the surface of the sand (e.g., at dawn (06:00) and early afternoon (14:00) at a depth of 5 cm, temperatures (+/- SD) of 16.32 +/- 0.96 degrees C and 25.04 +/- 1.47 degrees C were recorded, respectively. Corresponding temperatures at a depth of 30 cm were 19.17 +/- 0.59 degrees C and 19.78 +/- 1.60 degrees C, respectively). This demonstrates that while temperature conditions at the surface vary dramatically from night to day, ghost crab burrows can maintain relatively constant temperatures at the burrow base throughout the diurnal cycle, at least during winter. As a consequence, the burrow heat signatures undergo a corresponding thermal gradient reversal between night and day, as revealed by infra-red photography. Complementing these field observations, we also determined heating and cooling times/constants for O. cordimanus in the laboratory (tau = 17.54 and 16.59 JK(-1), respectively), and analysed chemical composition of their carapace (external (with beta Chitin evident) and internal (predominance of alpha Chitin)), which is the primary thermal interface with the environment. We find that ghost crabs both gain and lose heat relatively rapidly, which likely affects the range and duration of surface activities under different thermal conditions, and renders the thermal characteristics of their burrows vital for their persistence on beaches. Finally, we speculate that the distinctly contrasting thermal signatures of ghost crab burrows in comparison to the surrounding sand could in principle be used by crabs as spatial markers for navigation and to identify holes on return from nightly excursions, being identified either by direct thermal sensing or odours rising from the burrow base as a consequence of the thermal flux.

Telmatobius marmoratus avoids extremes of daily temperature fluctuation by utilizing thermally buffered aquatic habitat at all life stages, with minimal operative temperature variation (range: 4.6-8.0 degrees C). Pleurodema marmoratum, in contrast, experienced operative temperatures from -3.5 to 44 degrees C and has one of the widest thermal breadths reported for any tropical frog, from >32 degrees C (critical thermal maximum) to surviving freezing periods of 1 and 6 hr down to -3.0 degrees C.

Yet, among amphibians, the physiological impacts of short-term temperature variation are largely unknown. Using an ex situ population of Cryptobranchus alleganiensis, an aquatic North American salamander, we tested the hypothesis that naturally occurring periods of temperature variation negatively impact amphibian health, either through direct effects on immune function or by increasing physiological stress. We exposed captive salamanders to repeated cycles of temperature fluctuations recorded in the population's natal stream and evaluated behavioral and physiological responses, including plasma complement activity (i.e. bacteria killing) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila. The best-fit model (Delta AIC(c)=0, w(i)=0.9992) revealed 70% greater P. aeruginosa killing after exposure to variable temperatures and no evidence of thermal acclimation. The same model predicted 50% increased E. coli killing, but had weaker support (Delta AIC(c)=1.8, w(i)=0.2882). In contrast, plasma defenses were ineffective against A. hydrophila, and other health indicators (leukocyte ratios, growth rates and behavioral patterns) were maintained at baseline values. Our data suggest that amphibians can tolerate, and even benefit from, natural patterns of rapid warming/cooling. Specifically, temperature variation can elicit increased activity of the innate immune system. This immune response may be adaptive in an unpredictable environment, and is undetectable by conventional health indicators (and hence considered cryptic). Our findings highlight the need to consider naturalistic patterns of temperature variation when predicting species' susceptibility to climate change.","[Terrell, Kimberly A.; Gratwicke, Brian] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Ctr Species Survival, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [Quintero, Richard P.; Murray, Suzan; Murphy, James B.; Evans, Matthew J.; Nissen, Bradley D.] Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Ctr Anim Care Sci, Washington, DC 20008 USA; [Kleopfer, John D.] Virginia Dept Game & Inland Fisheries, Charles City, VA 23030 USA","Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Zoological Park & Conservation Biology Institute","Terrell, KA (corresponding author), Smithsonian Conservat Biol Inst, Ctr Species Survival, Natl Zool Pk,3001 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20008 USA.","terrellk@si.edu","Nissen, Bradley/W-6175-2019","Nissen, Bradley/0000-0001-6547-5734; Gratwicke, Brian/0000-0002-7332-4060","David H.

New biophysical modeling methods (NicheMapR) allow the calculation of the body temperature of thermoregulating animals anywhere in the world from first principles, but require detailed observational data for parameterization and testing. Here we describe the thermoregulatory biology of marching bands of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, in the Sahara Desert of Mauritania where extreme heat and strong diurnal fluctuations are a major constraint on activity and physiological processes. Using a thermal infrared camera in the field, we showed that gregarious nymphs altered the microhabitats they used, as well as postural thermoregulatory behaviors, to maintain relatively high body temperature (nearly 40 degrees C). Field and laboratory experiments demonstrated that the preferred body temperature accelerated digestive rates. Migratory bands frequently left foraging sites with full guts before consuming all vegetation and moved to another habitat before emptying their foregut. Thus, the repertoire for behavioral thermoregulation in the desert locust strongly facilitates foraging and digestion rates, which may accelerate developmental rates and increase survival. We used our data to successfully parameterize a general biophysical model of thermoregulatory behavior that could capture hourly body temperature and activity at our remote site using globally available environmental forcing data. This modeling approach provides a stronger basis for forecasting thermal constraints on locust outbreaks under current and future climates.","[Maeno, Koutaro Ould] Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci JIRCAS, Livestock & Environm Div, Ohwashi 1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan; [Maeno, Koutaro Ould; Ould Ely, Sidi; Ould Mohamed, Sid'Ahmed; Jaavar, Mohamed El Hacen; Ould Babah Ebbe, Mohamed Abdallahi] Ctr Natl Lutte Antiacridienne CNLA, Mauritanian Natl Desert Locust Ctr, BP 665, Nouakchott, Mauritania; [Piou, Cyril] Univ Montpellier, UMR CBGP, CIRAD, Inst Agro,IRD, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Kearney, Michael R.] Univ Melbourne, Sch BioSci, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Ould Ely, Sidi] Minist Rural Dev, Direct Agr, Nouakchott, Mauritania; [Ould Babah Ebbe, Mohamed Abdallahi] Inst Sahel INSAH CILSS, BP 1530, Bamako, Mali","Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences; CIRAD; Institut Agro; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; University of Melbourne","Maeno, KO (corresponding author), Japan Int Res Ctr Agr Sci JIRCAS, Livestock & Environm Div, Ohwashi 1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058686, Japan.;Maeno, KO (corresponding author), Ctr Natl Lutte Antiacridienne CNLA, Mauritanian Natl Desert Locust Ctr, BP 665, Nouakchott, Mauritania.","kmaeno@affrc.go.jp","Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017","Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K18808]; ANR JCJC PEPPER from the Agence National de la Recherche [ANR-18-CE32-0010-01]","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); ANR JCJC PEPPER from the Agence National de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR))","We thank T.

We examined the effect of fluctuating temperatures on reproduction and survival under starvation, two important components of fitness. We used the red flour beetle as a model organism, which is a significant pest in grain mills around the world. Fluctuations around the optimal temperature were always negative for the adult survival under starvation. The effect of thermal fluctuations on the number of offspring reaching adulthood was negative as well but increased with the extent of exposure. It was the strongest when the adult parents were kept and the offspring were raised under fluctuating temperatures. However, the later the offspring were exposed to fluctuations during their development, the weaker the effect of fluctuating temperatures was. Moreover, raising the parents under fluctuating temperatures but keeping them after pupation at constant temperatures fully alleviated the negative effects of fluctuations on the offspring. Finally, we demonstrate that keeping the parents a few days under fluctuating temperatures is required to induce negative effects on the number of offspring reaching adulthood. Our study disentangles between the effects of thermal fluctuations experienced during the parental and offspring stage thus contributing to the ongoing research of insects under fluctuating temperatures.","[Scharf, Inon; Segal, Daniella; Bar, Adi] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Gottlieb, Daphna] ARO, Inst Postharvest & Food Sci, Dept Food Sci, Volcani Ctr, Rishon Letsiyon, Israel","Tel Aviv University; VOLCANI INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH","Scharf, I (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.","scharfi@tauex.tau.ac.il","Scharf, Inon/AAF-2343-2020","Scharf, Inon/0000-0002-8506-7161","","","",NA,"72","0","0","4","8","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0306-4565","1879-0992","","J THERM BIOL","J.

Recent work has shown that mosquito and parasite biology are influenced not only by average temperature, but also by the extent of the daily temperature variation. Here we examine how parasite development within the mosquito (Extrinsic Incubation Period) is expected to vary over time and space depending on the diurnal temperature range and baseline mean temperature in Kenya and across Africa. Our results show that under cool conditions, the typical approach of using mean monthly temperatures alone to characterize the transmission environment will underestimate parasite development. In contrast, under warmer conditions, the use of mean temperatures will overestimate development. Qualitatively similar patterns hold using both outdoor and indoor temperatures. These findings have important implications for defining malaria risk. Furthermore, understanding the influence of daily temperature dynamics could provide new insights into ectotherm ecology both now and in response to future climate change.","[Blanford, J.

Ectotherms such as reptiles and amphibians are especially at risk due to their metabolic ties to the environment and their general inability to migrate with changing climates over short time frames. We modeled the growth response of Three-toed Box Turtles (Terrapene carolina triunguis) to fluctuations in ambient temperature and precipitation. Then we extrapolated this model to climate conditions expected in 2100. We predict that there is less than 20% possibility of hatchling turtles growing during their first year. Reduced annual growth rates during later years may cause earlier termination of growth, smaller standard carapace lengths, and reduced fecundity. These responses are typical of those that stimulate an extinction vortex. These findings provide for a general understanding of how this species and other terrestrial reptiles may respond to climate change. Without reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we could face catastrophic declines in many ectotherms as temperature and rainfall patterns change.","[McCallum, Malcolm L.] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Arts Sci & Educ, Texarkana, TX 75501 USA; [Trauth, Stanley E.] Arkansas State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, State Univ, AR 72467 USA","Texas A&M University System; Arkansas State University","McCallum, ML (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Coll Arts Sci & Educ, 2600 Robison Rd, Texarkana, TX 75501 USA.","malcolm.mccallum@herpconbio.org","","mccallum, malcolm/0000-0002-8708-5136","","","",NA,"51","17","17","1","35","BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS","LEIDEN","PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS","0173-5373","1568-5381","","AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA","Amphib.

We collected gravid females from 15 geographically separated populations of the lacertid lizard Psammodromus algirus, a widely distributed species with well differentiated eastern and western lineages. We incubated eggs under two treatments of constant (28A degrees C) and fluctuating (28 +/- A 4A degrees C) temperature, and we examined clutch, population, and lineage effects on several traits of females, eggs, and hatchlings. Incubation time was mainly explained by differences between lineages, but it was also influenced by population and female effects. Within each lineage, incubation was shorter at cooler and wetter sites, and for a given climate it was shorter for eastern than for western populations, suggesting that countergradient variation has evolved independently in the two lineages. Female size, clutch size, and relative fecundity were primarily influenced by inter-population differences, a pattern that seemed attributable to environmental differences in productivity, because mean female size was positively correlated with a gradient of increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature. Clutch size was mainly, but not entirely, dependent on female SVL, suggesting both a proximate effect of local conditions and intrinsic differences among populations. Females from drier and warmer sites produced larger hatchlings. Mean egg mass was mainly determined by familial effects. Eggs incubated at a constant temperature hatched earlier than did their siblings incubated at fluctuating temperatures, a fact that could be explained by considering that in Mediterranean environments developmental rate might increase at a lower speed above average incubation temperature than it does decrease below it.","[Diaz, Jose A.; Iraeta, Pablo; Verdu-Ricoy, Joaquin; Siliceo, Ignacio] Univ Complutense, Fac Biol, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis UD Vertebrados, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Verdu-Ricoy, Joaquin; Salvador, Alfredo] MNCN CSIC, Museo Nacl Ciencias Nat, Dept Ecol Evolut, Madrid 28006, Spain","Complutense University of Madrid; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales (MNCN)","Diaz, JA (corresponding author), Univ Complutense, Fac Biol, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis UD Vertebrados, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.","jadiaz@bio.ucm.es","Salvador, Alfredo/K-1670-2014; Iraeta, Pablo/F-7651-2012; Díaz, José A./H-5559-2015","Díaz, José A./0000-0001-6047-5065","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science; Universidad Complutense de Madrid; CSIC-JAE;  [CGL2007-60277/BOS];  [CGL2010-17928/BOS]","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Universidad Complutense de Madrid; CSIC-JAE; ; ","This study is a contribution to projects CGL2007-60277/BOS and CGL2010-17928/BOS, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science.

We use an established literature proxy method from Ward and Lafferty (Ward and Lafferty 2004 PLoS Biology 2, e120 (doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0020120)) to analyse a 44-year global record of normalized disease reports from 1970 to 2013. Major marine hosts are combined into nine taxonomic groups, from seagrasses to marine mammals, to assess disease swings, defined as positive or negative multi-decadal shifts in disease reports across related hosts. Normalized disease reports increased significantly between 1970 and 2013 in corals and urchins, indicating positive disease swings in these environmentally sensitive ectotherms. Coral disease reports in the Caribbean correlated with increasing temperature anomalies, supporting the hypothesis that warming oceans drive infectious coral diseases. Meanwhile, disease risk may also decrease in a changing ocean. Disease reports decreased significantly in fishes and elasmobranchs, which have experienced steep human-induced population declines and diminishing population density that, while concerning, may reduce disease. The increases and decreases in disease reports across the 44-year record transcend short-term fluctuations and regional variation. Our results show that long-term changes in disease reports coincide with recent decades of widespread environmental change in the ocean.","[Tracy, Allison M.; Pielmeier, Madeline L.; Yoshioka, Reyn M.; Harvell, C.

One linear and seven nonlinear regression functions were fit to egg-to-adult development rate data to characterize thermal performance curves. Temperature fluctuations significantly affected both development and longevity of T. radiata. Estimates of degree-days predicted by the linear model were 30% higher for the fluctuating regime than the constant regime. Nonlinear model estimations of theoretical minimum and maximum developmental thresholds were lower for the fluctuating regime when compared to the constant regime. These predictions align with experimental observations. Parasitoids reared under fluctuating profiles at low average temperatures developed faster (15 degrees C) and survived longer (15-20 degrees C) when compared to those reared under constant regimes with corresponding means. In contrast, high average fluctuating temperatures produced parasitoids with an extended developmental period (35 degrees C) and reduced longevity (30-35 degrees C). A meta-analysis of published T. radiata development datasets, together with the results of this study, indicated convergence in degree-days and theoretical minimum developmental thresholds among geographically distinct parasitoid populations. These findings demonstrate the significant effects of temperature on T. radiata life history and have important implications for optimization of mass-rearing and release efforts, improvement of predictions from climate modeling, and comparison of T. radiata population performance across climatic gradients and geographic regions.","[McCalla, Kelsey A.; Kececi, Mehmet; Milosavljevic, Ivan; Hoddle, Mark S.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Kececi, Mehmet] Malatya Turgut Ozal Univ, Dept Plant Protect, Fac Agr, TR-44210 Malatya, Turkey; [Ratkowsky, David A.] Tasmanian Inst Agr, Private Bag 98, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Hoddle, Mark S.] Univ Calif Riverside, Ctr Invas Species Res, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","University of California System; University of California Riverside; Malatya Turgut Ozal University; University of Tasmania; University of California System; University of California Riverside","McCalla, KA (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.","kscha008@ucr.edu","KEÇECİ, Mehmet/AAA-5880-2020","KEÇECİ, Mehmet/0000-0001-8589-8152","Citrus Research Board [5500-194, 15-8130-0336-CA]","Citrus Research Board","This work was supported, in part, from funds provided by the Citrus Research Board (award number 5500-194) and USDA-APHIS-HLB-MAC Agreement Number #15-8130-0336-CA.",NA,"110","26","27","1","20","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","0022-0493","1938-291X","","J ECON ENTOMOL","J.

For example, in organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), an inability to predict sex ratios under fluctuating incubation temperatures in the field hinders predictions of how species with TSD will fare in a changing climate. To better understand how sex determination is affected by thermal variation, we incubated Trachemys scripta eggs using a heat wave design, where embryos experienced a male-producing temperature of 25 +/- 3 degrees C for the majority of development and varying durations at a female-producing temperature of 29.5 +/- 3 degrees C during the window of development when sex is determined. We compared the sex ratios from these incubation conditions with a previous data set that utilized a similar heat wave design, but instead incubated eggs at a male-producing temperature of 27 +/- 3 degrees C but utilized the same female-producing temperature of 29.5 +/- 3 degrees C. We compared the sex ratio reaction norms produced from these two incubation conditions and found that, despite differences in average temperatures, both conditions produced 50:50 sex ratios after similar to 8days of exposure to female-producing conditions. This emphasizes that sex can be determined in just a few days at female-producing conditions and that sex determination is relatively unaffected by temperatures outside of this short window. Further, these data demonstrate the reduced accuracy of the constant temperature equivalent model (the leading method of predicting sex ratios) under thermally variable temperatures. Conceptualizing sex determination as the number of days spent incubating at female-producing conditions rather than an aggregate statistic is supported by the mechanistic underpinnings of TSD, helps to improve sex ratio estimation methods, and has important consequences for predicting how species with TSD will fare in a changing climate.","[Carter, A.

This paper uses the univoltine western corn root-worm (WCR, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) as a case study and employs deterministic and stochastic modeling to evaluate how insect population dynamics is shaped by density-dependent survival and annual variation in temperature, which are key in regulating insect populations. Field data showed that larval survival varied significantly between years but was constant for a range of densities. Survival dropped only beyond a threshold density, a feature resembling generalized Ricker functions used in modeling density-dependent survival due to scramble competition for resources. We used soil temperature data for 20 yr to model annual variation in developmental time and survival. The deterministic model, where the developmental time was same across years, showed that though survival was high and did not change for a range of densities (i.e., density-independent survival), predicted densities were large enough that strong density dependence could occur in the field (i.e., predicted densities fall in the region where survival drops sharply) and that populations could exhibit stable equilibrium, cycles, etc. Interestingly, populations with lower density-independent survival were less likely to produce stable equilibrium compared to populations with higher density-independent survival. We found that population densities were at stable equilibrium when both mean developmental time and fertility were relatively low or when developmental time and fertility were relatively high. This in turn implies that, in warmer regions, where mean developmental time will be lower, stability is more likely for insect populations with low fertility; species in warmer regions will experience cyclical and unstable dynamics when fertility is high. While increase in the mean developmental time reduces overall survival, increasing variation in developmental time could increase mean survival, a consequence of the Jensen's inequality, since survival was a concave decreasing function of developmental time. Hence, both mean and variability in temperature affect the dynamics of insect populations. Finally, we found that stochastic variation in soil temperature produced large variation in predicted population densities that could potentially enhance or diminish the effect of density dependence.","[Haridas, C.

By contrast, thermally homogeneous environments preclude behavioural thermoregulation, and ectotherms inhabiting these environments (particularly fish in which branchial respiration requires body temperature to follow water temperature) modify their biochemical capacities in response to long-term seasonal temperature fluctuations. Reptiles may also be active at seasonally varying body temperatures and could, therefore, gain selective advantages from regulating biochemical capacities. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that a reptile (the American alligator Alligator mississippiensis) that experiences pronounced seasonal fluctuations in body temperature will show seasonal acclimatisation in the activity of its metabolic enzymes. We measured body temperatures of alligators in the wild in winter and summer (N=7 alligators in each season), and we collected muscle samples from wild alligators (N=31 in each season) for analysis of metabolic enzyme activity (lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase). There were significant differences in mean daily body temperatures between winter (15.66+/-0.43degreesC; mean S.E.M.) and summer (29.34+/-0.21degreesC), and daily body temperatures fluctuated significantly more in winter compared with summer. Alligators compensated for lower winter temperatures by increasing enzyme activities, and the activities of cytochrome c oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly greater in winter compared with summer at all assay temperatures. The activity of citrate synthase was significantly greater in the winter samples at the winter body temperature (15degreesC) but not at the summer body temperature (30degreesC). The thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of mitochondrial enzymes decreased significantly in winter compared with in summer. The activity of mitochondrial enzymes was significantly greater in males than in females, but there were no differences between sexes for lactate dehydrogenase activity. The differences between sexes could be the result of the sex-specific seasonal demands for locomotor performance. Our data indicate that biochemical acclimatisation is important in thermoregulation of reptiles and that it is not sufficient to base conclusions about their thermoregulatory ability entirely on behavioural patterns.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Univ Laval, Dept Biol, St Foy, PQ G1K 7P4, Canada; Louisiana Dept Wildlife & Fisheries, Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge, Grand Chenier, LA 70643 USA","University of Sydney; Laval University","Seebacher, F (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.","","","Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311","","","",NA,"61","106","108","1","37","COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND","0022-0949","","","J EXP BIOL","J.

Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is hypothesized to be a useful predictor of population canalization, especially for organisms at risk from environmental change. 2. Identification of traits that meet statistical criteria as FA measures remains a challenge. 3. Here, a laboratory experiment subjected immature butterflies (Vanessa cardui) to diet and temperature conditions of varying stress levels. Variation in dietary macronutrient ratio (protein: carbohydrate) and rearing temperature (optimal: 25 degrees C; elevated: 32 degrees C) was introduced as stressors. Temperature and nutrition are key variables influencing ectotherm growth and fitness and so are likely to be important stressors that influence FA. 4. Individuals subjected to stressful conditions were predicted to show elevated FA of three wing size traits, as well as increased mortality and decreased adult body size. 5. Trait FA did not vary across treatments. Instead, treatment levels impacted viability: The combined incidence of pupal death and expression of significant wing malformations increased in treatment levels designated as stressful. Variation in adult dry mass also reflected predicted stress levels. Results suggest that individuals predicted to display increased FA either died or displayed gross developmental aberrations. 6. This experiment illustrates important constraints on the investigation of FA, including selection of appropriate traits and identification of appropriate levels of stressors to avoid elevated mortality. The latter concern brings into question the utility of FA as an indicator of stress in vulnerable, natural populations, where stress levels cannot be controlled, and mortality and fitness effects are often not quantifiable.","[Symanski, Cole; Redak, Richard A.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Entomol, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","University of California System; University of California Riverside","Symanski, C (corresponding author), 20 Dickens Ct, Irvine, CA 92617 USA.","symanski.cole@gmail.com","","Symanski, Cole/0000-0002-2071-4911","Entomology department at the University of California at Riverside","Entomology department at the University of California at Riverside","Funding was provided by the Redak lab and the Entomology department at the University of California at Riverside.",NA,"87","0","0","1","7","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Through thermal acclimation, animals can buffer the influence of the thermal environment by adjusting their physiology to stabilize certain processes in the face of environmental temperature change. The electric organ discharge (EOD) used by weak electric fish for electrocommunication and electrolocation is highly temperature sensitive. In some temperate species that naturally experience large seasonal fluctuations in environmental temperature, the thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of the EOD shifts after long-term temperature change. We examined thermal acclimation of EOD frequency in a tropical electric fish, Apteronotus leptorhynchus that naturally experiences much less temperature change. We transferred fish between thermal environments (253 and 27.8 degrees C) and measured EOD frequency and its thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) over 11 d. After 6 d, fish exhibited thermal acclimation to both warming and cooling, adjusting the thermal dependence of EOD frequency to partially compensate for the small change (2.5 degrees C) in water temperature. In addition, we evaluated the thyroid influence on EOD frequency by treating fish with thyroxine or the anti-thyroid compound propylthiouricil (PTU) to stimulate or inhibit thyroid activity, respectively. Thyroxine treatment significantly increased EOD frequency, but PTU had no effect. Neither thyroxine nor PTU treatment influenced the thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of EOD frequency during acute temperature change. Thus, the EOD of Apteronotus shows significant thermal acclimation and responds to elevated thyroxine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.","[Dunlap, K. D.; Ragazzi, M.

Research on thermal plasticity has traditionally focused on the response of organisms to shifts in mean temperatures. However, increased temperature variation can have a greater impact on organismal performance than mean temperature alone. In addition, thermal plasticity studies are often designed to investigate plasticity in response to more extreme temperatures despite the fact that organisms make physiological adjustments to diurnal temperature fluctuations that they experience. Using pupae of the dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, we investigated the potential for plasticity in response to increasing temperature mean and variance using thermal regimes that were well within the species critical thermal limits. We reared 40 beetles from egg to pupae (n = 20) or adults (n = 20) at one of nine incubation treatments, including all combinations of three mean temperatures (22, 24, 26 degrees C) and three amplitudes of fluctuation (+/- 2, +/- 4, +/- 8 degrees C). To measure thermal plasticity of pupae, we quantified CO2 production across a range of temperatures (i.e., 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) for 20 beetles per treatment. The relationship between CO2 production and temperature provides an estimate of energetic costs at a given temperature (i.e., using the intercept) and thermal sensitivity (i.e., using the slope). We reared the remaining O. taurus in each treatment (n = 20) to adulthood and then recorded mass (g) to determine body size, a proxy for fitness. Pupae exhibited thermal plasticity in response to the additive and interactive effects of temperature mean and variance. Pupae reared in the warmest and most variable treatment (26 +/- 8 degrees C) showed the greatest decrease in overall metabolism compared to all other treatments, and adult beetles from this treatment (26 +/- 8 degrees C) were also significantly smaller than adult beetles from any other treatment. We found that both temperature mean and variance contributed to thermal plasticity of pupae and had consequences for adult body size, a trait related to dung beetle fitness. Importantly, the temperatures we used in our treatments are not extreme and are likely well below the critical thermal maxima of the species, demonstrating that organisms can make adjustments to temperatures they experience across diurnal or seasonal timescales.","[Fleming, J.

We investigated whether the effect occurs through modification of metabolic reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing processes and is thus in line with the rate of living-free radical theory of aging. We compared 6 biogeographically and climatically distinct populations of the extremely long-lived ocean quahog Arctica islandica for age-dependent differences in metabolic rates and antioxidant capacities (superoxide dismutase, catalase activity and total glutathione concentration). The temperature and salinity ranges covered by the sampling locations (Norwegian coast, White Sea, Iceland, Kattegat, Kiel Bay and German Bight) were 3.7 to 9.3 degrees C and 20 to 35 ppt. Bivalve shells were used as age recorders by counting annual growth bands. Maximum determined age in different populations varied between 29 and 192 yr. Extreme longevity observed in some North Atlantic A. islandica populations seems to be based on their very low lifetime mass-specific respiration, in combination with stable maintenance of antioxidant protection throughout life in mature specimens. While the antioxidant capacity was similar among all populations, the shorter-lived populations exhibited the highest metabolic rates and showed no metabolic response (Q(10)) when warmed to higher temperature. Low and fluctuating salinity in the Baltic may further exert stress, which enhances respiration rates and reduces longevity in the Baltic Sea population. The exceptionally long lifespan of A. islandica cannot be exclusively explained by a well-established antioxidant defense system, and the long lifespan of some populations may rather be a function of low ROS formation (low metabolic rate) and high damage repair/removal capacities.","[Basova, Larisa] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg 199178, Russia; [Begum, Salma] Khulna Univ, Environm Sci Discipline, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh; [Strahl, Julia; Brey, Thomas; Abele, Doris] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Sukhotin, Alexey] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Zool, White Sea Biol Stn, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Philipp, Eva] Inst Clin Mol Biol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany","Saint Petersburg State University; Khulna University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Russian Academy of Sciences; Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences","Basova, L (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, 16 Line,29, St Petersburg 199178, Russia.","lbasova@hotmail.com","Basova, Larisa/B-8575-2011; Sukhotin, Alexey/H-4144-2013","Basova, Larisa/0000-0002-7883-8052; Sukhotin, Alexey/0000-0003-2626-5317; Brey, Thomas/0000-0002-6345-2851; Abele, Doris/0000-0002-5766-5017","DAAD [A/05/56588, A/07/72522, A/05/22368]; BMBF International Office [RUS-07/A11]; German Science foundation (DFG) [Ab124/10-1]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [10-04-00316]; Hanse Wissenschaftskolleg (Delmenhorst, Germany); DFG Cluster of Excellence 'The Future Ocean'","DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); BMBF International Office(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Science foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Hanse Wissenschaftskolleg (Delmenhorst, Germany); DFG Cluster of Excellence 'The Future Ocean'","The authors thank the crews of the AWI and IfM-Geomar research vessels for dredging animals from the German Bight and Baltic Sea, L.

While the molecular mechanism underlying temperature adaptation has long been of interest, it is still largely unexplored with fish. Understanding of the fundamental mechanisms conferring tolerance to temperature fluctuations is a topic of increasing interest as temperature may continue to rise as a result of global climate change. Catfish have a wide natural habitat and possess great plasticity in dealing with environmental variations in temperature. However, no studies have been conducted at the transcriptomic level to determine heat stress-induced gene expression. In the present study, we conducted an RNA-Seq analysis to identify heat stress-induced genes in catfish at the transcriptome level. Expression analysis identified a total of 2,260 differentially expressed genes with a cutoff of twofold change. qRT-PCR validation suggested the high reliability of the RNA-Seq results. Gene ontology, enrichment, and pathway analyses were conducted to gain insight into physiological and gene pathways. Specifically, genes involved in oxygen transport, protein folding and degradation, and metabolic process were highly induced, while general protein synthesis was dramatically repressed in response to the lethal temperature stress.

This study has demonstrated that endogenous levels of stress-70 proteins in M. edulis vary seasonally and are positively correlated with seasonal changes both in environmental temperature and thermal tolerance. The levels of stress-70 protein isoforms of 70, 72 and 78 kDa were analyzed in M. edulis L. collected at six consecutive bimonthly intervals from the River Exe (Devon, UK). Significant seasonal differences in endogenous levels of the stress-70 proteins in M. edulis were observed. Levels of these protein isoforms correlated positively with seasonal changes in environmental temperature. Levels of the 70 kDa protein showed a larger seasonal variation, more closely related to natural temperature change, than levels of the 72 and 78 kDa proteins. Additional mussels from the same samples were heat-stressed at 28.5 degrees C, a temperature at which M. edulis is unable to acclimate. M. edulis survived longer at 28.5 degrees C during the warmer months of the year. There were also positive correlations between time of survival at 28.5 degrees C and the coincident levels of endogenous stress-70 proteins. Our results provide evidence that environmental stress may have been sufficient to cause at least partial protein denaturation during a significant proportion of the year, and suggest that high natural concentrations of stress-70 proteins may promote thermal tolerance. Evidence from other studies suggests that maintaining high levels of stress proteins have significant energetic costs and may be detrimental to organismal fitness. We discuss our findings in terms of the costs and benefits associated with stress protein synthesis, and consequences for the ecology and distribution of marine ectotherms.

The purpose of this study was to gain essential information regarding the response of E. sosorum to several thermal manipulations. All salamanders used in this study were produced at the San Marcos Aquatic Resources Center (United States Fish and Wildlife Service) in San Marcos, Texas, USA, as part of a captive breeding program. To examine the effects of thermal stressors, we subjected salamanders to a nominal temperature increase of 0.5 degrees C per day until we observed a loss of righting response (LRR). Additionally, we assessed salamander growth following a 69-d trial in which we reared young E. sosorum at five temperature treatments (nominal 15, 18, 21, 24 and 27 degrees C). The cumulative ET50 (Effective Temperature at which half of the salamanders experienced a LRR [mean +/- SD]) for the combined replicates observed in E. sosorum was 32.6 +/- 0.08 degrees C. The optimal temperature for growth of E. sosorum based on weight and total length was estimated to be 18.7 degrees C and 18.3 degrees C, respectively. These results will aid in the conservation, management, and ongoing efforts to culture E. sosorum in captivity. Further, our results may provide insight to the potential thermal tolerances of other perennibranchiate Eurycea salamanders in central Texas thought to be sensitive to thermal fluctuations in their habitats.","[Crow, Justin C.; Ostrand, Kenneth G.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, San Marcos Aquat Resources Ctr, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA; [Forstner, Michael R.

As the environmental temperature is the abiotic factor with major incidence in the physiology and ecology of marine ectotherms, the abrupt temperature changes in upwelling systems could generate important variations in these organisms' functional processes. The relationship between ambient temperature and physiological performance can be described through a thermal performance curve (TPC). The parameters of this curve usually show geographic variation usually is in accordance with the predictions of the climate variability hypothesis (CVH), which states that organisms inhabiting more variable environments should have broader ranges of environmental tolerance in order to cope with the fluctuating environmental conditions they experience. Here we study the effect generated by the environmental variability in an active upwelling zone on the physiological performance of the marine ectotherm Achanthopleura echinata. In particular, we compared the parameters of the TPC and the metabolic rate of two populations of A. echinata, one found in high semi-permanent upwelling (Talcaruca), while the other is situated in an adjacent area with seasonal upwelling (Los Molles) and therefore more stable environmental conditions. Our results show that: (1) oxygen consumption increases with body size and this effect is more significant in individuals from the Talcaruca population, (2) optimal temperature, thermal breadth, upper critical limit and maximum performance were higher in the population located in the area of high environmental heterogeneity and (3) individuals from Talcaruca showed greater variance in optimal temperature, thermal breadth, upper critical limit but not in maximum performance. Although it is clear that a variable environment affects the thermal physiology of organisms, expanding their tolerance ranges and generating energy costs in the performance of individuals, it is relevant to note that upwelling systems are multifactorial phenomena where the rise of water masses modifies not only temperature, but also decreases O-2, pH, and increases pCO(2) which in turn could modify metabolism and TPC.</p>","[Manriquez, Nahomi; Bacigalupe, Leonardo D.] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolut, Valdivia, Chile; [Lardies, Marco A.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Artes Liberales, Santiago, Chile; [Lardies, Marco A.] Inst Milenio Socioecol Costera SECOS, Santiago, Chile","Universidad Austral de Chile; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez","Lardies, MA (corresponding author), Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Artes Liberales, Santiago, Chile.;Lardies, MA (corresponding author), Inst Milenio Socioecol Costera SECOS, Santiago, Chile.","marco.lardies@uai.cl","Lardies, Marco A/R-6203-2017; Manriquez Figueroa, Nahomi/GYA-3225-2022","Lardies, Marco A/0000-0003-3525-1830; ","","","",NA,"70","0","0","2","10","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-701X","","","FRONT ECOL EVOL","Front.

Frequent exposure of terrestrial insects to temperature variation has thus led to the evolution of protective biochemical and physiological mechanisms. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the positive impact of fluctuating thermal regimes (FTRs) on the fitness and survival of cold-exposed insects have not been studied. We have thus investigated the metabolic changes in adults of the beetle Alphitobius diaperinus in order to determine whether FTRs trigger the initiation of a metabolic response involving synthesis of protective compounds, such as free amino acids (FAAs) and polyols. The metabolic profile was analyzed during constant fluctuating thermal regimes (the beetles had daily pulses at higher temperatures that enabled them to recover) and compared with constant cold exposure and untreated controls. The increase of several essential amino acids (Lys, Iso, Leu, Phe and Trp) in cold-exposed beetles supports the conclusion that it results from the breakdown of proteins. Some FAAs have been shown to have cryoprotective properties in insects, but the relationship between FAAs, cold tolerance and survival has not yet been well defined. Instead of considering FAAs only as a part of the osmo- and cryoprotective arsenal, they should also be regarded as main factors involved in the multiple regulatory pathways activated during cold acclimation. Under FTRs, polyol accumulation probably contributes to the increased duration of survival in A. diaperinus.","Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6553, F-35042 Rennes, France; Biol Ctr AS CR, Inst Entomol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; Catholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Rech Biodiversite, Unite Ecol & Biogeog, B-3000 Louvain, Belgium; Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6026, Rennes, France; Michigan State Univ, Dept Plant Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Rennes 1; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Universite Catholique Louvain; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Rennes 1; Michigan State University","Renault, D (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6553, 1 Bat 14A,263 Ave Gal Leclerc,CS 74205, F-35042 Rennes, France.","david.renault@univ-rennes1.fr","colinet, hervé/K-8768-2019; Colinet, hervé/B-3677-2019; Kostal, Vladimir/G-6688-2014","Colinet, hervé/0000-0002-8806-3107; Kostal, Vladimir/0000-0002-4994-5123; Gagneul, David/0000-0002-9288-0986; RENAULT, David/0000-0003-3644-1759","","","",NA,"41","68","75","3","41","WILEY-BLACKWELL","MALDEN","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","1742-464X","","","FEBS J","FEBS J.","APR","2007","274","7","",NA,"",NA,"1759","1767","","10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.05723.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.05723.x","","","9","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology","145RY","17331186","Bronze","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000244883400012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Studies addressing the mechanisms for soil carbon release through organic matter decomposition have focused on the effect of changes in the average temperature, with little attention to changes in temperature variability. Anthropogenic activities are likely to modify both the average state and the variability of the climatic system; therefore, the effects of future warming on decomposition should not only focus on trends in the average temperature, but also variability expressed as a change of the probability distribution of temperature. Using analytical and numerical analyses we tested common relationships between temperature and respiration and found that the variability of temperature plays an important role determining respiration rates of soil organic matter. Changes in temperature variability, without changes in the average temperature, can affect the amount of carbon released through respiration over the long-term. Furthermore, simultaneous changes in the average and variance of temperature can either amplify or dampen the release of carbon through soil respiration as climate regimes change. These effects depend on the degree of convexity of the relationship between temperature and respiration and the magnitude of the change in temperature variance. A potential consequence of this effect of variability would be higher respiration in regions where both the mean and variance of temperature are expected to increase, such as in some low latitude regions; and lower amounts of respiration where the average temperature is expected to increase and the variance to decrease, such as in northern high latitudes.","[Thomann, E.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Math, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Perakis, S.

Studies of reptilian thermoregulation at climatic extremes are rare and, in the subarctic zone, completely lacking. Thermal characteristics of the habitat of the lizard Zootoca vivipara were studied in the subarctic zone, at the northern margin of its distribution, where lizard density was already extremely low. We found that, during the activity period, the preferred body temperatures of Z. vivipara were not available for a thermoconformer, but available for 7 h for a thermoregulator in an average day. Therefore, thermoconformity is unberieficial and accurate thermoregulation should be the appropriate strategy. We hypothesise that the extremely low lizard abundance at our subarctic study site is caused by the short activity season and the large daily temperature fluctuations, with night temperatures occasionally falling below zero even during the activity period.","Eotvos Lorand Univ, Behav Ecol Grp, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; Univ Helsinki, Ecol Genet Res Unit, Dept Ecol & Syst, Helsinki 00014, Finland","Eotvos Lorand University; University of Helsinki","Herczeg, G (corresponding author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Behav Ecol Grp, Dept Systemat Zool & Ecol, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-C, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.","gherc@freemail.hu","Merila, Juha/A-4061-2008; Herczeg, Gabor/AAZ-1661-2021; Hettyey, Attila/AFJ-8104-2022; Herczeg, Gábor/AAF-9978-2020","Merila, Juha/0000-0001-9614-0072; Herczeg, Gabor/0000-0003-0441-342X; Hettyey, Attila/0000-0003-0678-0936; ","","","",NA,"43","33","34","0","22","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0722-4060","1432-2056","","POLAR BIOL","Polar Biol.","JUL","2003","26","7","",NA,"",NA,"486","490","","10.1007/s00300-003-0507-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-003-0507-y","","","5","Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","703GD",NA,"","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000184270900009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Methods are needed to predict how such environmental variation affects ecological and evolutionary processes, in order to design effective strategies to conserve biodiversity under global change. Here, we review recent theoretical and empirical studies to assess: (1) how populations respond to changes in environmental variance, and (2) how environmental variance affects population responses to changes in mean conditions. Contrary to frequent claims, empirical studies show that increases in environmental variance can increase as well as decrease long-term population growth rates. Moreover, environmental variance can alter and even reverse the effects of changes in the mean environment, such that even if environmental variance remains constant, omitting it from population models compromises their ability to predict species' responses to changes in mean conditions. Drawing on theory relating these effects of environmental variance to the curvatures of population growth responses to the environment, we outline how species' traits such as phylogenetic history and body mass could be used to predict their responses to global change under future environmental variability.","[Lawson, Callum R.; van de Pol, Martijn] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vindenes, Yngvild] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth CEES, NO-0371 Oslo, Norway; [Bailey, Liam; van de Pol, Martijn] Australian Natl Univ, Div Evolut Ecol & Genet, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); University of Oslo; Australian National University","Lawson, CR (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Droevendaalsesteeg 10, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.","c.lawson@nioo.knaw.nl","; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Bailey, Liam D./0000-0002-8226-9454; Vindenes, Yngvild/0000-0003-1197-5818; van de Pol, Martijn/0000-0003-4102-4079; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X","Netherlands Institute of Ecology; British Ecological Society [4154/5048]; Research Council of Norway [NORKLIMA 224738]; Australian Postgraduate Award scholarship; Australian Research Council [FT120100204]","Netherlands Institute of Ecology; British Ecological Society; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Australian Postgraduate Award scholarship; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","We thank the Editor, Nigel Yoccoz, Jenny Hodgson, Bjorn Rall, Arie van Noordwijk, Kate Lessells, Tom Oliver, Adriaan Dokter, Stephanie Jenouvrier, Nina Mclean, Barbara Tomotani and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments.

Ectotherms, especially cryophilic stenotherms such as those endemic to Lake Baikal (Siberia), may demonstrate specialized physiological responses to acute temperature increases because their proteomes have evolved to function most efficiently at lower temperatures (e.g., <10 degrees C). Therefore, our study questioned the nature and degree of variation in physiological response to acute thermal stress in two congenerous, endemic Baikal amphipod species, Eulimnogammarus verrucosus and Eulimnogammarus cyaneus. We hypothesized that because interspecific and intersexual thermosensitivity varies significantly among ectotherms, there would be divergent intersexual and interspecific strategies to withstand acute thermal stress, manifested in different protein compositions and concentrations. We exposed individuals to the species' respective LT50 for one hour followed by a three-hour recovery period. We then performed 1D-PAGE, Western blotting, 2D-PAGE, and Mass Spectrometry techniques and assessed relative intersexual and interspecific changes in proteomic composition and heat shock protein 70 level. Our results demonstrate that females tend to be more sensitive to an acute thermal stimulus than males, most likely because females allocate significant energy to reproduction and less to heat shock response, evidenced by females' significantly lower LT50(time). Lower level of Hsp70 was found in females of the thermosensitive E. verrucosus compared to males of this species. No intersexual differences were found in Hsp70 level in thermotolerant E. cyaneus. Higher levels of hemocyanin subunits and arginine kinase were found in E. cyaneus females after heat shock and recovery compared to males, which was not found for E. verrucosus, suggesting interspecific mechanisms for E. cyaneus's higher thermotolerance. These differing responses between species and sexes of Baikal amphipods may reflect more general strategies for maintaining homeostatic conditions during acute thermal stress. As mean surface water temperatures increase worldwide, the net efficiency and efficacy of these strategies could give rise to long term changes in physiology, behavior, and interactions with other species, potentially precipitating population and community level alterations.","[Bedulina, Daria; Gurkov, Anton; Kondratjeva, Ekaterina; Baduev, Boris; Timofeyev, Maxim A.] Irkutsk State Univ, Inst Biol, Irkutsk, Russia; [Meyer, Michael F.] Washington State Univ, Sch Environm, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Gurkov, Anton; Baduev, Boris] Baikal Res Ctr, Irkutsk, Russia; [Gusdorf, Roman] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA","Irkutsk State University; Washington State University; University of Notre Dame","Timofeyev, MA (corresponding author), Irkutsk State Univ, Inst Biol, Irkutsk, Russia.","m.a.timofeyev@gmail.com","Timofeyev, Maxim/F-2071-2010; Gurkov, Anton/M-8708-2014","Timofeyev, Maxim/0000-0002-5250-6818; Gurkov, Anton/0000-0002-8390-1570","Russian Science Foundation [14-14-00400]; RFBR [15-04-06685, 15-29-01003, 16-34-00687]; CRDF Global [FSCX-15-611680]; Ministry of Education of Russia [6.1387.2017/PCh]; DAAD [6.731.2016.DAAD]; Fulbright Fellowship; Nanovic Institute of European Studies","Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); CRDF Global; Ministry of Education of Russia; DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Fulbright Fellowship; Nanovic Institute of European Studies","This work was supported by grants from the Russian Science Foundation (14-14-00400), RFBR (15-04-06685, 15-29-01003, 16-34-00687), CRDF Global (FSCX-15-611680); Ministry of Education of Russia (6.1387.2017/PCh, Goszadanie'') and DAAD (6.731.2016.DAAD), in part by a Fulbright Fellowship to MFM and a Pushkin Grant from the Nanovic Institute of European Studies to REG.

Physiological research at the organismal level provides information on the overall effects of stressors such as extreme temperature fluctuations. While experiments with whole organisms provide information as to the overall effects of temperature fluctuations, biochemical assays of thermal stress provide direct results of exposure that are both sensitive and specific. Electron transport system (ETS; Complex III) assays quantify a rate-limiting step of respiratory enzymes. Parameters that can be estimated via this approach include optimum thermal temperature (T-opt) and optimal breadth of thermal performance (T-breadth), which can both be related to organismal-level temperature thresholds. We exposed enzymes of seven fish species (native fish chosen to represent a typical community in Alabama streams) to temperatures in the range 11-44 degrees C. The resultant enzymatic thermal performance curves showed that T-opt, the lower temperature for enzyme optimal thermal performance (T-low), the upper temperature for enzyme optimal thermal performance (T-up), and T-breadth differed among species. Relationships between enzymatic activity and temperature for all fish followed a pattern of steadily increasing enzyme activity to T-opt before gradually decreasing with increasing temperature. A comparison of our enzyme optimum and upper-temperature limit results versus published critical thermal maxima values supports that ETS Complex III assays may be useful for assessing organismal-level thermal tolerance.","[Horne, Lindsay M.; DeVries, Dennis R.; Wright, Russell; Abdelrahman, Hisham A.; Stoeckel, James A.] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Horne, Lindsay M.] Lincoln Mem Univ, Sch Math & Sci, Dept Biol, Harrogate, TN 37752 USA; [Irwin, Elise] US Geol Survey, Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Units, Auburn, AL USA; [Staton, Benjamin A.] Quantitat Ecol Serv, Portland, OR USA; [Abdelrahman, Hisham A.] Cairo Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Vet Hyg & Management, Giza, Egypt","Auburn University System; Auburn University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University","Horne, LM (corresponding author), Lincoln Mem Univ, Sch Math & Sci, Dept Biol, Harrogate, TN 37752 USA.","lindsay.horne@lmunet.edu","Abdelrahman, Hisham/X-7511-2019","Abdelrahman, Hisham/0000-0003-1076-5536","Alabama Water Resources Research Institute; Alabama Power; Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; Alabama Experimental Station; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; National Institute of Food and Agriculture","Alabama Water Resources Research Institute; Alabama Power; Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; Alabama Experimental Station; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers(United States Department of DefenseUnited States Army); National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","Alabama Water Resources Research Institute; Alabama Power; Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; Alabama Experimental Station; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; National Institute of Food and Agriculture",NA,"71","0","0","0","0","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2471-5638","2471-5646","","J EXP ZOOL PART A","J.

In ectotherms, body size is usually negatively correlated with ambient temperature during development, a phenomenon known as The Temperature-Size Rule (TSR). However, a growing number of studies have indicated that temperature fluctuations have a large influence on life history traits and the implications of such fluctuations for the TSR are unknown. Our study investigated the effect of different constant and fluctuating temperatures on the body mass and development time of red flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum Herbst, 1797); we also examined whether the sexes differed in their responses to thermal conditions. We exposed the progeny of half-sib families of a T. castaneum laboratory strain to one of four temperature regimes: constant 30 degrees C, constant 25 degrees C, fluctuating with a daily mean of 30 degrees C, or fluctuating with a daily mean of 25 degrees C. Sex-specific development time and body mass at emergence were determined. Beetles developed the fastest and had the greatest body mass upon emergence when they were exposed to a constant temperature of 30 degrees C. This pattern was reversed when beetles experienced a constant temperature of 25 degrees C: slowest development and lowest body mass upon emergence were observed. Fluctuations changed those effects significantly - impact of temperature on development time was smaller, while differences in body mass disappeared completely. Our results do not fit TSR predictions. Furthermore, regardless of the temperature regime, females acquired more mass, while there were no differences between sexes in development time to eclosion. This finding fails to support one of the explanations for smaller male size: that selection favors the early emergence of males. We found no evidence of genotype x environment interactions for selected set of traits. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding responses to upper lethal temperature is critical to predict the effect of heat waves on populations. On the other hand, it is important to understand physiological traits allowing populations to adapt to changes in temperature. Here we compare survival to high temperatures of two moth species: a Mediterranean species Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis et Schiffermuller) and the broadly distributed Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner). Larvae were exposed to thermal stress, mimicking heat waves with daily maximum temperature (T-max) up to 45 degrees C. Control groups were kept at 25 degrees C. The changes in two heat shock proteins HSP70 and HSP90 were further studied for the second and third larval stages of T. pityocampa and H. armigera, respectively. An increase in mortality was observed on T. pityocampa larvae for T-max above 38 degrees C. On the contrary, larvae of H. armigera survived well up to 44 degrees C T-max, but survival decreased abruptly at 45 degrees C T-max. Thus, the two species differ by 6 degrees C on their upper threshold. For H. armigera HSP70 and HSP90 were both inducible by temperatures above 38 degrees C, steeply increasing with temperature which may account for superior adaptation to upper temperatures. In T. pityocampa HSP70 and HSP90 occurred constitutively in the control at 25 degrees C and did not increase with temperature. Results evidence major differences in HSP expression between species, which might account for differences in larval survival at the upper thermal limits.","[Branco, Manuela; Cortez, Miguel] Univ Lisbon, CEF Forest Res Ctr, Inst Super Agron, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal; [Esquivel, Maria Gloria; Cortez, Miguel; Figueired, Elisabete] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Agron, LEAF Linking Landscape Environm Agr & Food, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal","Universidade de Lisboa; Forest Research Centre; Universidade de Lisboa","Branco, M (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, CEF Forest Res Ctr, Inst Super Agron, P-1349017 Lisbon, Portugal.","mrbranco@isa.ulisboa.pt","Figueiredo, Elisabete/AAY-8128-2020; Branco, Manuela/D-5274-2011","Figueiredo, Elisabete/0000-0002-0795-4216; Branco, Manuela/0000-0002-8140-1257; Esquivel, Maria da Gloria/0000-0003-1772-0015","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [UID/AGR/00239/2013, UID/AGR/04129/2013]","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission)","This study was supported by national funds provided by the Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia including R&D Units projects UID/AGR/00239/2013 and UID/AGR/04129/2013.

Despite environmental fluctuations, lizards have developed behavioral mechanisms to maintain a relatively constant body temperature. These behaviors are particularly important for lizards living at high elevations like the high mountain lizard Phymaturus palluma, an endemic lizard to Central Andes. We studied how this species thermoregulates throughout the day and how abiotic and biophysical factors influence their activity. We recorded lizard activity and body postures and orientations at different times of the day during two seasons. Results indicate that P. palluma invest most of their time and energy in thermoregulation to maintain an optimal body temperature. Lizards activity raised with operative temperature of sun-exposed rocks up to an optimum and declined above that temperature. In addition, activity was negatively correlated with crevice temperature and positively correlated with mean operative temperature. Lizards changed their heat source along the day, using heliothermy most part of daytime and thigmothermy in the afternoon. Body postures were related to operative temperatures, so they may play an important role in thermoregulation. In contrast, body orientations were not related to operative temperatures. This study supports the idea that the benefit of thermoregulatory behaviors exceeds the energetic costs and the risk of predation involved in basking activities.","[Vicenzi, Nadia; Corbalan, Valeria] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Invest Zonas Aridas, IADIZA, Ave Ruiz Leal Sht, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; [Vicenzi, Nadia] Univ Nacl Cuyo, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Padre Jorge Contreras 1300, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina; [Ibarguengoytia, Nora] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Medioambiente, INIBIOMA, Quintral 1250, RA-8900 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University Nacional Cuyo Mendoza; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","Vicenzi, N (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Invest Zonas Aridas, IADIZA, Ave Ruiz Leal Sht, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina.;Vicenzi, N (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Cuyo, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Padre Jorge Contreras 1300, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina.","navicenzi@gmail.com","","","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (FONCyT) [PICT 20131139, PICT2014-3100]; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [PIP 11220120100676]; National Science Foundation [EF-1241848]","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (FONCyT)(ANPCyTFONCyT); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank Ruben Massarelli, Diego Ferrer, the Direccion de Recursos Naturales Renovables of Mendoza, and park rangers of the Aconcagua Provincial Park and IADIZA for their support in conducting this research.

Because smaller cells provide relatively more membrane area for transport, ectotherms that develop in warm environments should consist of small cells despite the energetic cost. Effects of constant temperatures on cell size qualitatively match this prediction, but effects of thermal fluctuations on cell size are unknown. Thermal fluctuations could favour either small or large cells; small cells facilitate transport during peaks in metabolic demand whereas large cells minimize the resources needed for homeoviscous adaptation. To explore this problem, we examined effects of thermal fluctuations during development on the size of epidermal cells in the wings of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies derived from a temperate population were raised at two mean temperatures (18 and 25 degrees C), with either no variation or a daily variation of +/- 4 degrees C. Flies developed faster at a mean temperature of 25 degrees C. Thermal fluctuations sped development, but only at 18 degrees C. An increase in the mean and variance of temperature caused flies to develop smaller cells and wings. Thermal fluctuations reduced the size of males at 18 degrees C and the size of females at 25 degrees C. The thorax, the wings and the cells decreased with an increase in the mean and in the variance of temperature, but the response of cells was the strongest. Based on this pattern, we hypothesize that development of the greater area of membranes under thermal fluctuations provides a metabolic advantage that outweighs the greater energetic cost of remodelling membranes.","[Czarnoleski, Marcin; Kierat, Justyna] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland; [Cooper, Brandon S.] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Angilletta, Michael J., Jr.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Jagiellonian University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe","Czarnoleski, M (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Gronostajowa 7, PL-30387 Krakow, Poland.","marcin.czarnoleski@uj.edu.pl","Czarnoleski, Marcin/H-2893-2015","Czarnoleski, Marcin/0000-0003-2645-0360; Kierat, Justyna/0000-0003-4534-095X","Fulbright Foundation; Kosciuszko Foundation; Indiana University Genetics, Cellular and Molecular Sciences Training Grant [T32-GM007757]; National Institutes of Health; Polish Ministry of Science and High Education [N N304 373238]; Jagiellonian University [DS/WBINS/INOS/757/2011]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES [T32GM007757] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Fulbright Foundation; Kosciuszko Foundation; Indiana University Genetics, Cellular and Molecular Sciences Training Grant; National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Polish Ministry of Science and High Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland); Jagiellonian University; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS))","M.C. was supported by fellowships from the Fulbright and Kosciuszko Foundations.

The particular conditions prevailing on islands have a strong effect on numerous features of animal life. In this study we compared mainland and island populations of the lizard Lacerta trilineata and hypothesized that insularity would affect the thermoregulatory strategy. Continental habitats were of lower thermal quality, experiencing more intense fluctuations and had higher values of operative temperatures. Nevertheless mainland lizards selected for higher body temperatures in the lab and showed more effective thermoregulation during summer than their island peers. Lizards achieved similar body temperatures in the field in both types of habitat, underlining the importance of predation as a potential factor to mainland lizards that failed to reach their higher thermal preferences. Both island and mainland populations of L trilineata have been adapted to their thermal environment, supporting the labile view on the evolution of thermal physiology for this species.

We assessed whether complete feed restriction prior to (24 degrees C, days 0-23) and/or during (14 degrees C, days 24-114) a simulated period of cold-acclimation could elicit episodes of compensatory growth (CG) and catch-up growth upon warm-up to 24 degrees C and satiation feeding (days 115-148). Control hybrid striped bass (HSB: Morone chrysops Chi Morone saxatilis) were fed to satiation throughout the entire experiment under these temperature fluctuations. Compensatory growth and ultimately catch-up growth were achieved in groups of HSB that were deprived of feed during either the initial period at 24 degrees C (days 0-23), during the cold-acclimation period (14 degrees C, days 24-114), or during both of these periods (days 0-114). Further, it appears that HSB are better able to compensate for weight loss when skeletal length is not significantly compromised during the treatment period, which occurred in HSB feed restricted during cold-acclimation only. The most dramatic CG responses were defined by specific growth rates (SGRs) up to 4.2 times that of controls and were accompanied by hyperphagia and improvements in temporal and overall feed conversion. Levels of plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and muscle IGF-1 mRNA were significantly correlated to growth rate for all groups throughout the experiment (R-2 = 0.40, 0.23, respectively), with an overcompensation of both observed in HSB with the most elevated SGRs during the CG response. Interestingly, opposing trends were observed between muscle mRNA expression of growth hormone receptor (GHR)-1 and -2, with fasting at 24 degrees C and 14 degrees C resulting in depressed levels of GHR-1 and elevated levels of GHR-2 relative to controls. Levels of muscle myostatin (MSTN)-1 mRNA were significantly depressed in HSB fasted at 24 degrees C and/or 14 degrees C while MSTN-2 mRNA was lower following initial feed restriction at 24 degrees C. Likewise, levels of unprocessed pro-MSTN (precursor) and mature MSTN protein were both depressed in fasted fish at 24 degrees C. This study demonstrates that a previous period of feed restriction and cold-acclimation followed by realimentation at more favorable water temperatures produces a strong CG response and catch-up growth in fish. These studies also suggest that an overcompensation of circulating and local IGF-1 along with changes in MSTN mRNA and protein expression may contribute to accelerated growth rates characteristic of CG. Furthermore, our studies indicate that overall feed conversion can improve by as much as 30% with CG induced through temperature and feeding manipulations with no adverse effects on growth of HSB. This raises the possibility that CG protocols can improve production efficiency of HSB and other temperate teleosts in pond or tank culture. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

An understanding of the interaction between physiology and demographic processes is necessary to predict the impacts of climate change. Reptiles are particularly sensitive to temperature, but only a few studies have explored the relationship between thermoregulatory strategy and demography in these animals. Using 12 years of mark-recapture data on two sympatric colubrid snakes (Hierophis viridiflavus and Zamenis longissimus), we tested whether demographic parameters are influenced by contrasted thermoregulatory strategies. The thermophilic and conspicuous species (H. viridiflavus) grew faster than the thermoconforming and secretive species (Z. longissimus), and this difference was most pronounced in open habitats, suggesting that the metabolic benefits associated with high thermal preferences depend on environmental factors at small spatial scales. Survival varied annually in both species, but was not lower in H. viridiflavus despite a higher degree of exposure. In Z. longissimus, survival was negatively affected by low temperatures during the active season, possibly underlying an exposure trade-off.","[Lelievre, Herve; Rivalan, Philippe; Delmas, Virginie; Ballouard, Jean-Marie; Bonnet, Xavier; Lourdais, Olivier] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UPR 1934, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France; [Lelievre, Herve; Ballouard, Jean-Marie] Univ Poitiers, F-86022 Poitiers, France; [Blouin-Demers, Gabriel] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Poitiers; University of Ottawa","Lelievre, H (corresponding author), CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UPR 1934, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, France.","hervelelievre@hotmail.com","Blouin-Demers, Gabriel/GRS-0626-2022","Bonnet, Xavier/0000-0001-6150-8199; Lourdais, Olivier/0000-0001-7840-103X","Conseil General des Deux-Sevres; Region Poitou-Charentes; ANR (ECTOCLIM project)","Conseil General des Deux-Sevres(Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine); Region Poitou-Charentes(Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine); ANR (ECTOCLIM project)(French National Research Agency (ANR))","This research was made possible by the financial support of the Conseil General des Deux-Sevres, the Region Poitou-Charentes, and the ANR (ECTOCLIM project).

Given the potential of seasonal acclimation to reduce the impact of climate change on the dynamics of ectotherm populations, the adaptive evolution of this reversible plasticity has received much attention. Nevertheless, the key assumption of selection on the magnitude of seasonal acclimation, consistent among-individual variation (repeatability), remains unexplored. We studied the short- (across body temperatures) and long-term (over two consecutive years) repeatability of seasonal acclimation on standard metabolic rate (SMR) and spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA) in two sympatric newt taxa, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris. We exposed the newts to various fluctuating thermal regimes over spring and summer and measured SMR and SLA at three body temperatures in each individual over two consecutive years. We quantified seasonal acclimation as difference between summer and spring trait values. We show that individuals of both species vary substantially in their seasonal acclimation responses. Body temperature affected the population means of seasonal acclimation in a quadratic I. alpestris or linear L. vulgaris fashion. Both short- and long-term repeatability of SMR and SLA seasonal acclimation were poor and both species varied in the amount of total variation in the plastic response. Seasonal shifts in environmental temperatures showed high variation between years, but with no apparent trend attributable to local climate change. Our results demonstrate that seasonal SMR and SLA acclimation prevents the establishment of a consistent relationship between individual trait values and environmental gradients, which may limit the adaptive evolution of this plastic response. Disparate thermal dependence patterns and the amount of total variation in seasonal acclimation suggest a species-specific ability for coping with stochasticity of seasonal variation in the thermal environment. To sum up, information on individual variation and population means measured across ecologically realistic body temperatures is necessary to fully understand the occurrence of seasonal acclimation across taxa and its role in the adaptive capacity to climate change.

These events will drive many organisms towards their physiological limits of thermal tolerance. Recently, many reports support a limited scope for adaptive evolutionary responses to high temperatures, meaning a conserved heat tolerance among ectotherms in general. We address this problem and tested the heat and cold tolerance invariant-variant hypotheses in terrestrial isopods. We studied five different populations of Porcellio laevis and three populations of Porcellio scaber, spanning 30 degrees S latitudinal gradient in Chile. The heat tolerance of woodlice was conserved with little variation along latitude and environmental temperatures, but cold tolerance decreases significantly with environmental temperatures and latitudes. Indeed, a significant and negative correlation was observed between cold tolerance and latitude. Also, significant and positive correlations were observed among cold tolerance and environmental temperatures. Conversely, heat tolerance was not significantly correlated with any of the environmental temperatures tested neither with latitude. This macrophysiological pattern indicated that heat and cold-tolerances of species and populations not always change across geographical gradients meaning that thermal tolerance responses to high temperatures may be evolutionary constrained.

However, it is not yet well understood how changing patterns of environmental variation will affect wildlife population dynamics and other ecological processes. Theory predicts that a population's long-run growth rate is diminished and the chance of population extinction is increased as environmental variation increases. This results from the fact that population growth is a multiplicative process and that long-run population growth rate is the geometric mean of growth rates over time, which is always less than the arithmetic mean. However, when population growth rates for unstructured populations are related nonlinearly to environmental drivers, increasing environmental variation can increase a population's long-run growth rate. This suggests that patterns of environmental variation associated with different aspects of climate change may affect population dynamics in different ways. Specifically, increasing variation in rainfall might result in diminished long-run growth rates for many animal species while increasing variation in temperature might result in increased long-run growth rates. While the effect of rainfall is theoretically well understood and supported by data, the hypothesized effect of temperature is not. Here, I analyse two datasets to study the effect of fluctuating temperatures on growth rates of zooplankton. Results are consistent with the prediction that fluctuating temperatures should increase long-run growth rates and the frequency of extreme demographic events.","Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA","National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis","Drake, JM (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.","drake@nceas.ucsb.edu","Drake, John/D-6622-2012","Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235","","","",NA,"39","83","84","0","57","ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","0962-8452","1471-2954","","P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI","Proc.

Climate change further induces temperature variations. In this study, we hypothesise that water temperatures, in particular thermal extremes, can significantly influence chemical toxicity to ectothermic organisms. Although temperature-dependent chemical toxicity (TDCT) is a classic research area in ecotoxicology, a unified model for predicting TDCT for freshwater species is yet to be developed. This study aimed to address this challenging issue through a meta-analysis by comparing acute toxicity endpoints (i.e. median lethal or effective concentration data; LC50 or EC50) of 13 chemicals for various freshwater species generated from different temperatures. Our results suggest that in most cases, freshwater species exhibit the highest tolerance towards chemicals at their physical optimal temperature (T-opt), and chemical toxicity exacerbates when temperature is higher or lower than T-opt (i.e. inverted V-shaped model between temperature and LC50 or EC50). Such observations are further supported by temperature-dependent hazardous concentration 10% (HC10) values derived from species sensitivity distributions constructed using toxicity data generated at different temperatures. A unified mathematical model was also developed to describe the inverted V-shape relationship between temperature and HC10 derivations. Overall, considering the natural variations of freshwater temperatures, the inverted V-shaped TDCT model can be readily applied to derive water quality guidelines and assess ecological risks of chemical contaminants.

Thus, there is an increased interest in understanding the effects of changes in means and variances of temperature on traits of climatic stress resistance. Here, we examined short-term (within-generation) variation in mean temperature (23, 25, and 27 degrees C) at three levels of diel thermal fluctuations (delta = 1, 3, or 5 degrees C) on an invasive pest insect, the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Using the adult flies, we address the hypothesis that temperature variability may affect the climatic stress resistance over and above changes in mean temperature at constant variability levels. We scored the traits of high- and low-thermal tolerance, high- and low-temperature acute hardening ability, water balance, and egg production under benign conditions after exposure to each of the nine experimental scenarios. Most importantly, results showed that temperature variance may have significant effects in addition to the changes in mean temperature for most traits scored. Although typical acclimation responses were detected for most of the traits under low variance conditions, high variance scenarios dramatically altered the outcomes, with poorer climatic stress resistance detected in some, but not all, traits. These results suggest that large temperature fluctuations might limit plastic responses which in turn could reduce the insect fitness. Increased mean temperatures in conjunction with increased temperature variability may therefore have stronger negative effects on this agricultural pest than elevated temperatures alone. The results of this study therefore have significant implications for understanding insect responses to climate change and suggest that analyses or simulations of only mean temperature variation may be inappropriate for predicting population-level responses under future climate change scenarios despite their widespread use.","[Terblanche, John S.; Nyamukondiwa, Casper; Kleynhans, Elsje] Univ Stellenbosch, Fac AgriSci, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Stellenbosch University","Terblanche, JS (corresponding author), Univ Stellenbosch, Fac AgriSci, Dept Conservat Ecol & Entomol, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa.","jst@sun.ac.za","Terblanche, John/AAB-4457-2020","Terblanche, John/0000-0001-9665-9405","Deciduous Fruit Producers Trust (DFPT); Citrus Research International (CRI); THRIP (National Research Foundation)","Deciduous Fruit Producers Trust (DFPT); Citrus Research International (CRI); THRIP (National Research Foundation)","We are grateful to several anonymous referees for their comments which helped to improve the manuscript.

In particular, bioenergetics models are increasingly applied to evaluate conditions that vary on subdaily time steps, such as vertical migrations that influence thermal experience and fluvial alterations that increase diurnal temperature variability. However, because the algorithms that describe the relationship between temperature and physiological rates are often nonlinear, using inputs of daily mean temperatures can result in underestimation or overestimation of growth and energetic demand. We used simulations of daily and subdaily models of Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha as an example to demonstrate that the nonlinear, temperature-dependent algorithms for consumption and respiration induce large differences in growth between constant-and fluctuating-temperature conditions (despite the same mean daily temperature); these differences increase with high diurnal variability and as temperatures approach the thermal optimum for the species. To correct for model bias in growth, we propose an integrated temperature-scaling algorithm that allows application of the daily model to systems where daily temperatures exhibit considerable subdaily variation. This approach can also be used for any bioenergetics model that includes nonlinear, temperature-dependent algorithms and should be considered when modeled temperatures approach inflection points in nonlinear relationships.","[Holsman, Kirstin] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 7600 Sand Point Way Northeast,Bldg 4, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Danner, Eric] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 110 Shaffer Rd, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Holsman, K (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 7600 Sand Point Way Northeast,Bldg 4, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","kirstin.holsman@noaa.gov","","Danner, Eric/0000-0003-0860-2869","Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean under National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA10OAR4320148]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX08AK72G]","Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean under National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","We thank K.

Studies suggest that plastic responses are crucial for species' ability to cope with thermal stress including variability in temperature, but most often laboratory studies on thermal adaptation in plant and ectotherm organisms are performed at constant temperatures and few species included. Recent studies using fluctuating thermal regimes find that thermal performance is affected by both temperature mean and fluctuations, and that plastic responses likely will differ between species according to life strategy and selective past. Here we investigate how acclimation to fluctuating or constant temperature regimes, but with the same mean temperature, impact on heat stress tolerance across a plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) and two arthropod species (Orchesella cincta and Drosophila melanogaster) inhabiting widely different thermal microhabitats and with varying capability for behavioral stress avoidance. Moreover, we investigate the underlying metabolic responses of acclimation using NMR metabolomics. We find increased heat tolerance for D. melanogaster and A. thaliana exposed to fluctuating acclimation temperatures, but not for O. cincta. The response was most pronounced for A. thaliana, which also showed a stronger metabolome response to thermal fluctuations than both arthropods. Generally, sugars were more abundant across A. thaliana and D. melanogaster when exposed to fluctuating compared to constant temperature, whereas amino acids were less abundant. This pattern was not evident for O. cincta, and generally we do not find much evidence for similar metabolomics responses to fluctuating temperature acclimation across species. Differences between the investigated species' ecology and different ability to behaviorally thermoregulate may have shaped their physiological responses to thermal fluctuations.","[Noer, Natasja Krog; Pagter, Majken; Bahrndorff, Simon; Kristensen, Torsten Nygaard] Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Aalborg, Denmark; [Malmendal, Anders] Roskilde Univ, Dept Sci & Environm, Roskilde, Denmark","Aalborg University; Roskilde University","Noer, NK (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Chem & Biosci, Aalborg, Denmark.","nkn@bio.aau.dk","Malmendal, Anders/F-1198-2017","Malmendal, Anders/0000-0002-8413-9717; Noer, Natasja Krog/0000-0002-4430-0342; Bahrndorff, Simon/0000-0002-0838-4008","Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF-8021-00014B]","Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","This work was supported by a grant from the Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF-8021-00014B) to T.N.K.The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",NA,"110","6","7","1","8","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","OCT 29","2020","15","10","",NA,"",NA,"","","e0237201","10.1371/journal.pone.0237201","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237201","","","20","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","PG8YH","33119606","Green Submitted, Green Published, gold","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000600013600115","View Full Record in Web of Science"

I found no indication of an early extension of the breeding season or a significant population trend.

Amphibians are especially vulnerable because thermoregulation often trades with appropriate water balance. Although substantial research has evaluated the effect of temperature in amphibian locomotion and physiological limits, there is little information about amphibians living under extreme temperature conditions. Leptodactylus lithonaetes is a frog allegedly specialised to forage and breed on dark granitic outcrops and associated puddles, which reach environmental temperatures well above 40 degrees C. Adults can select thermally favourable microhabitats during the day while tadpoles are constrained to rock puddles and associated temperature fluctuations; we thus established microhabitat temperatures and tested whether the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of L. lithonaetes is higher in tadpoles compared to adults. In addition, we evaluated the effect of water temperature on locomotor performance of tadpoles. Contrary to our expectations, puddle temperatures were comparable and even lower than those temperatures measured in the microhabitats used by adults in the daytime. Nonetheless, the CTmax was 42.3 degrees C for tadpoles and 39.7 degrees C for adults. Regarding locomotor performance, maximum speed and maximum distance travelled by tadpoles peaked around 34 degrees C, approximately 1 degrees C below the maximum puddle temperatures registered in the puddles. In conclusion, L. lithonaetes tadpoles have a higher CTmax compared to adults, suggesting a longer exposure to extreme temperatures that lead to maintain their physiological performance at high temperatures. We suggest that these conditions are adaptations to face the strong selection forces driven by this granitic habitat.","[Beltran, Ivan] Univ Los Andes, Dept Biol Sci, Carrera 1 18A-12, Bogota 4976, DC, Colombia; [Beltran, Ivan] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Beltran, Ivan] Univ Vienna, Dept Cognit Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria","Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Macquarie University; University of Vienna","Beltran, I (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Dept Biol Sci, Carrera 1 18A-12, Bogota 4976, DC, Colombia.;Beltran, I (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.;Beltran, I (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Cognit Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.","ic.beltran196@gmail.com","Beltrán, Iván/M-4247-2019","Beltrán, Iván/0000-0003-4439-8391; Ramirez-Castaneda, Valeria/0000-0001-5057-5126; Lasso, Eloisa/0000-0003-4586-8674","Department of Biological Sciences; Faculty of Sciences, at the Universidad de Los Andes","Department of Biological Sciences; Faculty of Sciences, at the Universidad de Los Andes","We are deeply grateful to Fernando Trujillo, scientific director of the Fundacion Omacha, for allowing us to conduct this research at Bojonawi Nature Reserve.

Mitigation hinges on understanding disease-specific risk profiles, but current risk maps are severely limited in spatial resolution. One important determinant of MBD risk is temperature, and though the relationships between temperature and risk have been extensively studied, maps are often created using sparse data that fail to capture microclimatic conditions. Here, we leverage high resolution land surface temperature (LST) measurements, in conjunction with established relationships between air temperature and MBD risk factors like mosquito biting rate and transmission probability, to produce fine resolution (70 m) maps of MBD risk components. We focus our case study on West Nile virus (WNV) in the San Joaquin Valley of California, where temperatures vary widely across the day and the diverse agricultural/urban landscape. We first use field measurements to establish a relationship between LST and air temperature, and apply it to Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment data (2018-2020) in peak WNV transmission months (June-September). We then use the previously derived equations to estimate spatially explicit mosquito biting and WNV transmission rates. We use these maps to uncover significant differences in risk across land cover types, and identify the times of day which contribute to high risk for different land covers. Additionally, we evaluate the value of high resolution spatial and temporal data in avoiding biased risk estimates due to Jensen's inequality, and find that using aggregate data leads to significant biases of up to 40.5% in the possible range of risk values. Through this analysis, we show that the synergy between novel remote sensing technology and fundamental principles of disease ecology can unlock new insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of MBDs.","[Boser, Anna; Larsen, Ashley] UC Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Sousa, Daniel] San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [MacDonald, Andrew] UC Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; California State University System; San Diego State University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara","Boser, A (corresponding author), UC Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","annaboser@ucsb.edu","Sousa, Daniel/L-6602-2019","Sousa, Daniel/0000-0002-1632-1955; MacDonald, Andrew/0000-0003-0172-7749","National Science Foundation [1650114, DEB-2042526]; Fogarty International Center [DEB-2011147]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Fogarty International Center(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC))","AB acknowledges support from National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (1650114), AEL acknowledges support from National Science Foundation (DEB-2042526), AJM acknowledges support from National Science Foundation and the Fogarty International Center (DEB-2011147).

Elevated nest temperatures could increase the incidence of embryonic mortality and/or maladaptive phenotypes. We investigated whether elevated nest temperatures reduce hatching success in tropical flatback turtles (Natator depressus) nesting in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. Egg incubation treatments began at 29.5 degrees C and progressively increased in temperature throughout incubation, up to maxima of 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 degrees C. Elevated nest temperatures did not reduce hatching success or hatchling body size relative to control temperatures (29.5 degrees C), but did speed up embryonic development. A combination of sudden exposure to high temperatures during the first 2 weeks of incubation (>36 degrees C for 48 h) and prolonged warming throughout incubation (from 29.5-35 degrees C) did not reduce hatching success. We also recorded an unusually high pivotal sex-determining temperature in this flatback turtle population relative to other sea turtle populations: an equal ratio of male and female hatchlings is produced at similar to 30.4 degrees C. This adaptation may allow some flatback turtle populations to continue producing large numbers of hatchlings of both sexes under the most extreme climate change scenarios. Some tropical populations of nesting flatbacks may possess important adaptations to high-temperature incubation environments, which are not found in more southerly temperate populations.","[Howard, Robert; Pike, David A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Bell, Ian] Dept Environm & Heritage Protect, Townsville, Qld 4814, Australia","James Cook University","Pike, DA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.","david.pike22@gmail.com","","","","","",NA,"38","21","21","2","79","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

Despite evidence that climate warming induces changes in water availability, acclimation responses to water restriction are understudied compared with thermal acclimation. In addition, acclimation responses may involve different modes, paces, and trade-offs between physiological and behavioral traits. Here, we tested the dynamical acclimation responses of a dry-skinned terrestrial ectotherm to chronic water restriction. Yearling common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) were exposed to sublethal water restriction during 2 mo of the summer season in laboratory conditions, then released in outdoor conditions for 10 additional months. Candidate behavioral (exploration, basking, and thermal preferences) and physiological (metabolism at rest and standard water loss rate) traits potentially involved in the acclimation response were measured repeatedly during and after water restriction. We observed a sequential acclimation response in water-restricted animals (yearlings spent less time basking during the first weeks of water deprivation) that was followed by delayed sex-specific physiological consequences of the water restriction during the following months (thermal depression in males and lower standard evaporative water loss rates in females). Despite short-term negative effects of water restriction on body growth, annual growth, survival, and reproduction were not significantly different between water-restricted and control yearlings. This demonstrates that beneficial acclimation responses to water restriction involve both short-term flexible behavioral responses and delayed changes in thermal and water biology traits.","[Rozen-Rechels, David; Meylan, Sandrine; Qitout, Kenza; Le Galliard, Jean-Francois] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, INRA, Inst Ecol & Sci Environm,Inst Rech Dev, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 5, France; [Dupoue, Andreaz] Univ Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Stn Eecol Theor & Expt, CNRS, UMR 5321, 2 Route CNRS, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Decenciere, Beatriz; Agostini, Simon; Le Galliard, Jean-Francois] Paris Sci & Lettres Res Univ, Ctr Rech Ecol Expt & Predict CEREEP Ecotron IleDe, Ecole Normale Super, Dept Biol,CNRS,UMR 3194, 78 Rue Chateau, F-77140 St Pierre Les Nemours, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris","Rozen-Rechels, D (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, INRA, Inst Ecol & Sci Environm,Inst Rech Dev, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 5, France.","david.rozen-rechels@normalesup.org","; Le Galliard, Jean-Francois/E-8702-2011","Sandrine, MEYLAN/0000-0002-0865-3335; Le Galliard, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-5965-9868; Decenciere, Beatriz/0000-0002-2847-7631","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-13-JSV7-0011-01, ANR-17-CE02-0013]","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR))","We thank Arnaud Badiane and Xavier Raynaud for their help in improving the manuscript.

These inferences build on the ecological relevance of the tolerance estimates and assume that estimates can be extrapolated to relevant conditions. Methodological effects for upper thermal limits have been extensively investigated, with different ramping rates and acclimation regimes giving rise to varying, and even disparate, conclusions. However, methodological effects have received much less attention for lower thermal limits. In this study, we explicitly test whether methodology could affect estimates of lower thermal limits in interaction with acclimation temperature and thermal variability, by acclimating adult Drosophila melanogaster to different constant and fluctuating temperature regimes and generating reaction norms at different ramping rates. We find that ramping rates have no significant effect on the lower thermal limits. Constant temperature acclimation resulted in non-linear reaction norms, while the introduction of thermal variability during adult life result in linear reaction norms. Thus, applying ecologically relevant conditions (here thermal variability) potentially impacts the results and conclusions of insect low temperature tolerance and acclimation capacity.","[Sorensen, Jesper Givskov; Winther, Marius Lossl; Salachan, Paul Vinu; MacLean, Heidi Joan] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Ny Munkegade 114,Bldg 1540, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Aarhus University","Sorensen, JG (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Ny Munkegade 114,Bldg 1540, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.","jesper.soerensen@bios.au.dk","Salachan, Paul Vinu/K-9517-2019; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov/J-3190-2013","Salachan, Paul Vinu/0000-0002-8179-5989; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov/0000-0002-9149-3626","Aarhus University Research Foundation","Aarhus University Research Foundation","We thank Trine Bech Sogaard and Annemarie Hojmark for excellent help in the fly lab, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

We combine biophysical, demographic and evolutionary models with recent climate data to address this question for the subalpine and alpine butterfly, Colias meadii, in the southern Rocky Mountains. We focus on predicting patterns of selection and evolution for a key thermoregulatory trait, melanin (solar absorptivity) on the posterior ventral hindwings, which affects patterns of body temperature, flight activity, adult and egg survival, and reproductive success in Colias. Both mean annual summer temperatures and thermal variability within summers have increased during the past 60 years at subalpine and alpine sites. At the subalpine site, predicted directional selection on wing absorptivity has shifted from generally positive (favouring increased wing melanin) to generally negative during the past 60 years, but there is substantial variation among years in the predicted magnitude and direction of selection and the optimal absorptivity. The predicted magnitude of directional selection at the alpine site declined during the past 60 years and varies substantially among years, but selection has generally been positive at this site. Predicted evolutionary responses to mean climate warming at the subalpine site since 1980 is small, because of the variability in selection and asymmetry of the fitness function. At both sites, the predicted effects of adaptive evolution on mean population fitness are much smaller than the fluctuations in mean fitness due to climate variability among years. Our analyses suggest that variation in climate within and among years may strongly limit evolutionary responses of ectotherms to mean climate warming in these habitats.","[Kingsolver, Joel G.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Buckley, Lauren B.] Univ Washington, Dept Biol, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Kingsolver, JG (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.","jgking@bio.unc.edu","Buckley, Lauren/ABD-6759-2021","Buckley, Lauren/0000-0003-1315-3818","NSF [DEB-1120062]","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Research supported in part by NSF grant no.

Reproductive traits are particularly sensitive to heat stress that can induce a permanent sterility, or at least hypofertility, of adult males. This study aims to compare physiological and biochemical responses associated to male performances to an exposure of 24 h to moderately high temperature (36 degrees C) among three inbred lines of N. vitripennis (AsymC, Cor, Oul). Cor males showed very specific metabolic adjustments compared to the two other lines. By contrast, Oul males showed stronger phenotypic adjustment of its life cycle, and produced metabolic water to compensate water loss by heat stress. Finally, AsymC males had probably more difficulties to acclimate at 36 degrees C, even for a short period, as their adult longevity was significantly reduced.

However, as the start of the growing season often varies substantially across years, adaptive parental effects on juvenile developmental rates may mediate the costs of a delayed season. By employing a meta-analysis, we tested whether larval developmental rates across a latitudinal cline of the common frog (Rana temporaria) are affected by fluctuating onsets of breeding, across years. We predicted that larval developmental rate will be inversely related to the onset of breeding, and that northern populations will be more prone to shorten their developmental rate in response to late breeding, as the costs of delayed metamorphosis should be highest in areas with a shorter growing season. We found that the larval period of both northern and southern populations responded to parental environmental conditions to a similar degree in absolute terms, but in different directions. In northern populations, a late season start correlated with decreased development time, suggesting that the evolution of parental effects aids population persistence in time-constrained environments. In southern populations, late season start correlated with increased development time, which could potentially be explained as a predator avoidance strategy. Our findings suggest that local ecological variables can induce adaptive parental effects, but responses are complex, and likely trade-off with other ecological factors.","[Rowinski, Piotr K.; Gotthard, Karl; Sowersby, Will; Eckerstrom-Liedholm, Simon; Bogen, Bjorn] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Laurila, Anssi; Lind, Martin, I; Richter-Boix, Alex] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Anim Ecol, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Bogen, Bjorn] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Freshwater Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-17893 Drottningholm, Sweden","Stockholm University; Uppsala University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","Rowinski, PK; Bogen, B (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Bogen, B (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Freshwater Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-17893 Drottningholm, Sweden.","Piotr.Rowinski@zoologi.su.se; Bjorn.Rogell@slu.se","Richter-Boix, Alex/E-3990-2012","Richter-Boix, Alex/0000-0002-8559-5191; Rowinski, Piotr/0000-0002-7247-3742; Lind, Martin/0000-0001-5602-1933; Sowersby, Will/0000-0002-9774-5935; Eckerstrom-Liedholm, Simon/0000-0002-3705-1907","Stockholm University; Swedish Research Council","Stockholm University; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission)","Open access funding provided by Stockholm University.

In addition, 30 fish ( I I carrying ultrasonic transmitters) were fitted with archival temperature-logging tags to record temperatures encountered by Gulf sturgeon over the course of a year, including both their riverine and estuarine residency. Movement rates of Gulf sturgeon in the Suwannee River were greatest during the upstream migration in March and April 2001 (4.8 km/d) and upon their emigration from the river in September 2001 (6.4 and 16.0 km/d for males and females, respectively). Mean maximum distance that fish were relocated upstream was significantly greater for male Gulf sturgeon (165 km) than for females (126 km). This may relate to female Gulf sturgeon not spawning annually and thus not migrating to putative spawning grounds upriver. In contrast, rates of upstream movement did not differ significantly between sexes. Movements in the nearshore regions of the Suwannee River estuary did not differ between males and females (0.8 and 2.2 km/d, respectively), and was much lower than in the river. Three Gulf sturgeon hearing archival temperature tags were recovered in subsequent netting activities in 2002. Data downloaded from the tags demonstrated that on average Gulf sturgeon were exposed to a 13 degrees C annual flux in temperature, ranging from 26 degrees C in the river during the summer to 13 degrees C in the estuary in the winter, although individual fish experienced as much as a 20 degrees C range (8.1-28.5 degrees C) over the course of a year. Given the influence of temperature on the metabolism of ectotherms such as sturgeon, this broad fluctuation in temperature may have profound implications for the bioenergetics, and hence growth and reproduction, of Gulf sturgeon.","[Parkyn, Daryl C.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Zool, Box 7617, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Colle, Douglas E.; Holloway, James D.] Univ Florida, IFAS, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA","University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Parkyn, DC (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Zool, Box 7617, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.","dparkyn@ufl.edu","","","sturgeon research initiative from the State of Florida Legislature under the auspices of the Florida Sturgeon Production Working Group; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, St. Petersburg, Florida","sturgeon research initiative from the State of Florida Legislature under the auspices of the Florida Sturgeon Production Working Group; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, St. Petersburg, Florida","We thank the many people at University of Florida who assisted in collection of data for this study, in particular P.

For a period of 3 mo, we placed four groups of snakes under four contrasted thermal treatments: (1) a natural regime (NR), based on daily variations (24-h cycle); (2) an accelerated regime (AR), where the thermoperiod fluctuated rapidly (12-h cycle); (3) a slow regime (SR; 48-h cycle); and (4) a cool stable regime (ZR; no fluctuation). The mean temperature, set at 23 degrees C, was identical for the four groups. For the first three groups (NR, AR, SR), ambient temperature fluctuated between 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Relative humidity and photoperiod were constant. We recorded feeding success, digestion efficiency, growth rate, activity, and ecdysis events. Differences between groups were expected because of varied exposure to the optimal temperatures, most notably in the ZR group, where the preferred body temperature for digestion (similar to 30 degrees C) would not be reached. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of the experimental treatment on feeding rate, digestion, body mass increase, and growth rate. Our results do not conform to the paradigm stipulating that maximal body temperature selected by ectotherms necessarily corresponds to the most efficient for resource assimilation and that temperature fluctuations are essential. We propose that increasing the digestive tract's performance through body-temperature elevation trades off against elevated (parasite) energy expenditure from the rest of the body. The main advantage of high body temperatures would be to reduce the amount of time necessary to assimilate prey rather than to improve the net mass gain during digestion.","[Michel, Catherine Louise; Bonnet, Xavier] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UPR 1934, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, Beauvoir Sur Ni, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","Michel, CL (corresponding author), CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UPR 1934, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, Beauvoir Sur Ni, France.","michel@cebc.cnrs.fr","","Bonnet, Xavier/0000-0001-6150-8199","Ecole Doctorale Diversite du vivant Paris 6","Ecole Doctorale Diversite du vivant Paris 6","C.L.M. was supported by a grant from Ecole Doctorale Diversite du vivant Paris 6.

For 'normal' body temperatures - benign temperatures near the species' mean - thermal biology traditionally uses performance curves to describe how physiological capabilities vary with temperature. However, these curves, which are typically measured under static laboratory conditions, can yield incomplete or inaccurate predictions of how organisms respond to natural patterns of temperature variation. For example, scale transition theory predicts that, in a variable environment, peak average performance is lower and occurs at a lower mean temperature than the peak of statically measured performance. We also demonstrate that temporal variation in performance is minimized near this new 'optimal' temperature. These factors add complexity to predictions of the consequences of climate change. We then move beyond the performance curve approach to consider the effects of rare, extreme temperatures. A statistical procedure (the environmental bootstrap) allows for long-term simulations that capture the temporal pattern of extremes (a Poisson interval distribution), which is characterized by clusters of events interspersed with long intervals of benign conditions. The bootstrap can be combined with biophysical models to incorporate temporal, spatial and physiological variation into evolutionary models of thermal tolerance. We conclude with several challenges that must be overcome to more fully develop our understanding of thermal performance in the context of a changing climate by explicitly considering different forms of small-scale variation. These challenges highlight the need to empirically and rigorously test existing theories.","[Dowd, W.

For ectothermic predators, ambient temperature may also influence daily routines through its effects on physiological performance. Temperatures can fluctuate significantly over the diel cycle and ectotherms may synchronize behaviour tomatch thermal regimes in order to optimize fitness. We used bio-logging to quantify activity and body temperature of blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) at a tropical atoll. Behavioural observations were used to concurrently measure bite rates in herbivorous reef fishes, as an index of activity for potential diurnal prey. Sharks showed early evening peaks in activity, particularly during ebbing high tides, while body temperatures peaked several hours prior to the period of maximal activity. Herbivores also displayed peaks in activity several hours earlier than the peaks in shark activity. Sharks appeared to be least active while their body temperatures were highest and most active while temperatures were cooling, although we hypothesize that due to thermal inertia they were still warmer than their smaller prey during this period. Sharksmay be most active during early evening periods as they have a sensory advantage under low light conditions and/ or a thermal advantage over cooler prey. Sharks swaminto shallow water during daytime low tide periods potentially to warm up and increase rates of digestion before the nocturnal activity period, which may be a strategy to maximize ingestion rates.

Daily and seasonal environmental temperature fluctuations are amplified in desert and semi-desert species. As ectotherms, they can ameliorate physiological constrains through behavioral thermoregulation. Herein, we explored the thermal biology and behavioral related aspects of the endangered sand lizard Liolaemus scapularis and compared it between austral spring and summer seasons. The study was carried out in a north sector of Medanos de Cafayate in the SW of Salta province, Argentina. Mean field-body temperature (Tb) of L. scapularis was 35.72 degrees C ranging from 29.10 to 41.10 degrees C. Regression analyzes showed that substrate temperature (Ts) was the parameter that best explained the variability of the Tb. Body temperature in spring was only positively related to Ts, whereas in summer the Tb was positively related to air temperature (Ta). Despite GLMs indicated that the Tb of L. scapularis result statistically unchanged through seasons sampled and sexes, microenvironmental temperatures were different for males and females between sampled seasons. The behavioral thermoregulation trait assessed, sun exposure, revealed that the use of patches with different sun input varied with temperature parameters and between seasons. This behavioral trait seems to have a crucial role in the thermal strategy of these lizards in order to maintain an optimal homeostatic state avoiding overheating; still the Tb recorded for the studied population places Liolaemus scapularis in the upper range for the genus. Our results suggest that the species is an active thermoregulator with a hit gain through sand conduction mainly, a relevant shuttling behavior and seasonal intraspecific shifts.","[Salva, Ana Gabriela] Fdn Miguel Lillo, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CONICET, Miguel Lillo 251, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Salva, Ana Gabriela; Robles, Cecilia Ines] Fdn Miguel Lillo, Inst Ecol Comportamiento & Conservac, Miguel Lillo 251,T4000JFE, San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Tulli, Maria Jose] Univ Nacl Tucuman, Fac Ciencias Nat & IML, Fdn Miguel Lillo, Unidad Ejecutora Lillo,CONICET,FML, San Miguel De Tucuman, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Miguel Lillo Foundation; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Miguel Lillo Foundation; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Miguel Lillo Foundation; Universidad Nacional de Tucuman","Salva, AG (corresponding author), Fdn Miguel Lillo, Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CONICET, Miguel Lillo 251, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina.","anagsalva@gmail.com","","","PICT-FONCYT [2013-2301]; Fundacion Miguel Lillo","PICT-FONCYT; Fundacion Miguel Lillo","Financial support was provided by PICT-FONCYT No 2013-2301 and by Fundacion Miguel Lillo through the C.

However, there are few studies concerning the role of thermal variability on ecological processes. Based on insect thermal and population ecology, we propose a theoretical framework for organizing the study of the role that thermal mean and variability plays in individual performance, and how it may affect population dynamics. Starting with three predictions of global warming scenarios, we develop null models of the expected changes in individual physiological performance and population dynamics. Ecological consequences in each scenario may range from simple changes in performance to drastic changes in population fluctuations and geographic ranges. In particular, our null models show that potential changes in the intrinsic population growth rate (R-m) will depend on the interaction of mean temperature and thermal variability, and that the net effect of the interaction could be synergistic or antagonistic. To evaluate these null models, we fit performance curves to compiled data from the literature on measurements of R-m at several constant and fluctuating temperatures. The fitted models showed that several of the qualitative characteristics predicted by the null model may be found in the fitted curves. We expect that this framework will be useful as a guide to study the influence of thermal changes on the dynamics of natural populations.","[Estay, Sergio A.] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolutivas, Valdivia, Chile; [Lima, Mauricio; Bozinovic, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, LINC Global MIII, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile","Universidad Austral de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","Estay, SA (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolutivas, Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile.","sergio.estay@uach.cl","Lima, Mauricio/F-2722-2013","Lima, Mauricio/0000-0002-3700-2945; Estay, Sergio/0000-0002-3797-8964","CONICYT [79100021]; FONDECYT [1130015]","CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT)","SAE would like to acknowledge CONICYT grant 79100021.

Current acclimation theory suggests that when daily variation is large and unpredictable ectotherms should not acclimate but should evolve wide performance breadths, allowing maintenance of performance across a wide thermal range. The subtropical intertidal zone, however, experiences a large amount of daily thermal variation, but daily means and ranges shift in predictable ways with season, where daily and seasonal variation is roughly equal. We predicted that animals in this habitat would maintain their capacity to acclimate and that performance breadth would not be altered by acclimation to maintain function with rapidly fluctuating daily temperatures. We tested our prediction using a subtropical goby, Bathygobius cocosensis, which lives in tide pools that vary widely, over days and seasons. We exposed B. cocosensis to winter (12-17 degrees C) and summer (30-35 degrees C) thermal conditions for six weeks and then measured the thermal dependence of burst swimming speed, routine and maximum metabolic rate, and ventilation rate between 12and36 degrees C. B. cocosensis exhibited an acclimation response for burst swimming speed, maximum metabolic rate and metabolic scope, but acclimation did not alter the shape of acute thermal performance curves. These results indicate that thermal acclimation can occur when short-term thermal variability is large and equal to seasonal variation, and wide performance breadths can be maintained with acclimation in heterogeneous environments.","[da Silva, Carmen Rose Burke; Riginos, Cynthia; Wilson, Robbie Stuart] Univ Queensland, Fac Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","University of Queensland","da Silva, CRB (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Fac Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.","Carmen.dasilva@uq.net.au","Riginos, Cynthia/G-3320-2010","Riginos, Cynthia/0000-0002-5485-4197; Wilson, Robbie/0000-0002-0116-5427; da Silva, Carmen/0000-0003-0160-5872","","","",NA,"82","19","19","1","17","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0174-1578","1432-136X","","J COMP PHYSIOL B","J.

As terrestrial areas within a watershed slowly recover, stream environments and biota can experience repeated and long-lasting challenges. In 2011, the Las Conchas wildfire burned (1)/(3) of the Valles Caldera National Preserve in northern New Mexico, USA. Seven y post-fire, streams located near the burn perimeter continue to experience varying levels of alteration (e.g., channel alteration with large diel temperature swings), whereas the terrestrial uplands have begun to recover. Extreme temperatures in stream systems may affect the aquatic community, including ectotherms such as caddisflies. These post-fire temperature ranges may increase an ectotherm's breadth of thermal adaptation, but at metabolic costs that diminish organismal performance, such as growth, development, and fecundity. In this study we characterized in-situ effects of varied thermal regimes across preserve streams on the performance of the caddisfly Hydropsyche oslari Banks, 1905. We measured mass and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in H. oslari larvae from preserve streams affected by wildfire (high temperature range) and in streams minimally affected by wildfire (low temperature range). We predicted that increased daily temperature maxima and reduced daily temperature minima (i.e., large diel temperature swings) would be associated with reduced H. oslari mass because of the limiting effects of suboptimal temperatures on growth. As predicted, in the weeks prior to their emergence as terrestrial adults, 5(th)-instar larvae within the high-temperature range stream had reduced mass (mean 3.3 +/- SE 0.55 mg) relative to larvae from the low-temperature range stream (6.2 +/- 0.69 mg). We also predicted that CTmax of H. oslari would reflect stream thermal history. Indeed, larvae H. oslari from the high-temperature range stream exhibited increased CTmax (35.4 +/- 0.17 degrees C) compared with larvae from the low-temperature range stream (34.4 +/- 0.28 degrees C). We demonstrated that the effects of wildfire on caddisflies can be long lasting, as evidenced by the reduced size at maturity and higher thermal tolerance in a caddisfly population 7 y post-fire.","[Kremer, Lauren B.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Ecol, 2980 South Espina St,Knox Hall 132, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Caldwell, Colleen A.] New Mexico Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, United States Geol Survey, 2980 South Espina St,Knox Hall 132, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","New Mexico State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey","Kremer, LB (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Fish Wildlife & Conservat Ecol, 2980 South Espina St,Knox Hall 132, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.;Caldwell, CA (corresponding author), New Mexico Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, United States Geol Survey, 2980 South Espina St,Knox Hall 132, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.","l.kremer@colostate.edu; ccaldwel@usgs.gov","","","National Park Service (Valles Caldera); Robert Parmenter of the Valles Caldera Na-tional Preserve","National Park Service (Valles Caldera); Robert Parmenter of the Valles Caldera Na-tional Preserve","This research was funded by the National Park Service (Valles Caldera).

Because many phenotypic traits are sensitive to environmental conditions, directional climate change could significantly alter trait distribution within populations and may generate an evolutionary response. In species with environment-dependent sex determination, climate change may lead to skewed sex ratios at hatching or birth. However, there are virtually no empirical data on the putative link between climatic parameters and sex ratios from natural populations. We monitored a natural population of viviparous lizards with temperature-dependent sex determination (Niveoscincus ocellatus) over seven field seasons. Sex ratios at birth fluctuated significantly among years and closely tracked thermal conditions in the field, with the proportion of male offspring increasing in colder years. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of local climatic conditions (e.g. temperature) on offspring sex ratio fluctuations in a free-living population of a viviparous ectotherm. A succession of warmer-than-usual years (as predicted under many climate-change scenarios) likely would generate female-biased sex ratios at birth, while an increase in interannual variation (as also predicted under climate change scenarios) could lead to significant fluctuations in cohort sex ratios. If cohort sex ratio bias at birth leads to adult sex ratio bias, long-term directional changes in thermal conditions may have important effects on population dynamics in this species.","[Wapstra, Erik; Sinn, David L.; Mazurek, Katrina] Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Uller, Tobias; Olsson, Mats] Univ Wollongong, Sch Biol Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Uller, Tobias] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Edward Grey Inst, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; [Joss, Jean] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Shine, Richard] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","University of Tasmania; University of Wollongong; University of Oxford; Macquarie University; University of Sydney","Wapstra, E (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Zool, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.","erik.wapstra@utas.edu.au","Wapstra, Erik/J-7482-2014; Olsson, Mats/AAK-5565-2021","Wapstra, Erik/0000-0002-2050-8026; Olsson, Mats/0000-0002-4130-1323","Hermon Slade Foundation; Australian Research Council; Wenner-Gren Foundations","Hermon Slade Foundation; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Wenner-Gren Foundations","The authors thank the Hermon Slade Foundation and the Australian Research Council for support ( E.W., T.U., M.O., R.S.).

Comparing thermal reaction norms among populations from different thermal environments allows us to gain insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underlying thermal adaptation. Here, we have examined thermal adaptation in six wild populations of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) from markedly different natural environments by analyzing thermal reaction norms for fecundity, thorax length, wing area, and ovariole number under ecologically realistic fluctuating temperature regimes in the laboratory. Contrary to expectation, we found only minor differences in the thermal optima for fecundity among populations. Differentiation among populations was mainly due to differences in absolute (and partly also relative) thermal fecundity performance. Despite significant variation among populations in the absolute values of morphological traits, we observed only minor differentiation in their reaction norms. Overall, the thermal reaction norms for all traits examined were remarkably similar among different populations. Our results therefore suggest that thermal adaptation in D. melanogaster predominantly involves evolutionary changes in absolute trait values rather than in aspects of thermal reaction norms.","[Klepsatel, Peter; Galikova, Martina; De Maio, Nicola; Huber, Christian D.; Schloetterer, Christian; Flatt, Thomas] Vetmeduni Vienna, Inst Populat Genet, A-1210 Vienna, Austria; [Huber, Christian D.] Univ Vienna, Max F Perutz Labs, A-1030 Vienna, Austria","University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; Medical University of Vienna; University of Vienna; Vienna Biocenter (VBC); Max F.

To test the impact of urbanization on development and latitudinal trends in body size, we launched a citizen science project to collect periodical cicadas (Magicicadaseptendecim) from across their latitudinal range during the 2013 emergence of Brood II. Periodical cicadas are long-lived insects whose distribution spans a broad latitudinal range covering both urban and rural habitats. We used a geometric morphometric approach to assess body size and developmental stress based on fluctuating asymmetry in wing shape. Body size of rural cicadas followed converse Bergmann's rule, but this pattern was disrupted in urban habitats. In the north, urban cicadas were larger than their rural counterparts, while southern populations showed little variation in body size between habitats. We detected no evidence of differences in developmental stress due to urbanization. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that urbanization disrupts biogeographical trends in body size, and this pattern highlights how the effects of urbanization may differ over a species' range.","[Beasley, DeAnna E.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Chattanooga, TN 37403 USA; [Beasley, DeAnna E.; Penick, Clint A.; Boateng, Nana S.; Dunn, Robert R.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC USA; [Penick, Clint A.; Dunn, Robert R.] North Carolina State Univ, Keck Ctr Behav Biol, Raleigh, NC USA; [Penick, Clint A.] Arizona State Univ, Biomimicry Ctr, Tempe, AZ USA; [Menninger, Holly L.] Univ Minnesota, Bell Museum, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Dunn, Robert R.] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Macroecol Evolut & Climate, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark","University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee at Chattanooga; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; University of North Carolina; North Carolina State University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Copenhagen","Beasley, DE (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Chattanooga, TN 37403 USA.","deanna-beasley@utc.edu","","Dunn, Robert/0000-0002-6030-4837; Beasley, DeAnna/0000-0001-9250-7244; Penick, Clint/0000-0002-5368-507X","NSF MSP [1319293]; NSF REU [1136717]","NSF MSP; NSF REU(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD))","This project was funded by a NSF MSP grant (#1319293) and a NSF REU-Broadening Participation Supplement (#1136717).",NA,"71","7","7","4","39","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Anthropogenic habitat modifications, such as prescribed fire, can provide insight on the phenotypic response of ectotherms to structural habitat change. Our objective was to quantify the effect of fire-altered landscapes on the locomotor performance of the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). Lizard sprint performance was compared among three habitats with different fire histories: a control habitat, which had not experienced fire in more than 60years, a recovering habitat that had not experienced fire in 4years, and a recent burn habitat that burned less than 6months prior to the study. There were significant differences in locomotor performance among lizards from the different habitats (indicative of phenotypic plasticity), and lizards in the recent burn habitat had significantly higher maximum sprint speeds than lizards in recovering and control habitats. To measure the consistency of locomotor performance within individuals, lizards were captured and raced during the field seasons of 2014 and again in 2015. Locomotor performance was significantly repeatable across years, suggesting lizard populations contain considerable individual variation, despite this trait being closely tied to fitness. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to observe individual between-year repeatability in performance of free-ranging S.undulatus. Lizards had similar body condition among habitats suggesting that nutritional status did not play a role in performance plasticity. Habitats differed both structurally and thermally, and less restrictive thermal regimes in recently burned habitats appear to be the underlying mechanism permitting increased lizard locomotor performance.","[Wild, K.

In this study we used radio-telemetry and streamside surveys to examine the influence of local climatic conditions on individual activity levels (detectability) and streamside density of a population of endangered giant barred frog (Mixophyes iteratus) along the Coomera river in south-east Queensland. Temperature was the most important climatic variable influencing the behaviour and hence detectability of M. iteratus. The results indicated that males bury under the leaf litter during cold conditions (< 18 degrees C) so fewer were detected during surveys. Although females were also found to bury under the leaf litter in cold weather, no significant relationship between exposure and streamside density was detected. This is likely to be due to the lower number of females detected during surveys. The streamside density of juveniles was significantly related to temperature and rainfall, but little of the variance in the data was explained by climatic conditions, despite greater numbers of juveniles being found than adults. These results indicate that, for increased efficiency, surveys of Mixophyes iteratus should be undertaken when temperatures exceed 18 degrees C.","Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; Griffith Univ, Ctr Innovat Conservat Strategies, Sch Environm, Bundall, Qld 9726, Australia","University of Tasmania; Griffith University","Koch, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Geog & Environm Studies, Private Bag 78, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.","ajkoch@utas.edu.au","Hero, Jean-Marc/A-4257-2010","Koch, Amelia/0000-0002-6521-083X","","","",NA,"33","8","10","0","28","CSIRO PUBLISHING","COLLINGWOOD","150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD, VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA","0004-959X","","","AUST J ZOOL","Aust.

By studying side-blotched lizards, Uta stansburiana, we were able to calculate the timing and length of the growing season as well as the timing of the breeding season for this species at a site in the Pacific Northwest based primarily on temperature data. We then used historical meteorological data to test for the effects of short- and long-term fluctuations in climate modes on lizards using indices for the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Results indicate that these two climate modes affect different aspects of life history and that their effects, either alone or in combination, have the potential to alter not only phenology (e.g., timing of reproduction) but also population recruitment and even persistence. Yet, using these climate modes to predict biological outcomes of future climate change may be difficult to accomplish due to regional variation of their impacts and their inherent complexity.","[Zani, Peter A.] Gonzaga Univ, Dept Biol, Spokane, WA 99258 USA; [Rollyson, Mary E.] Lafayette Coll, Dept Biol, Easton, PA 18042 USA","Gonzaga University; Lafayette College","Zani, PA (corresponding author), Whitman Coll, Dept Biol, Walla Walla, WA 99362 USA.","zanipa@whitman.edu","","","","","",NA,"76","9","9","2","31","AMER MIDLAND NATURALIST","NOTRE DAME","UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA","0003-0031","1938-4238","","AM MIDL NAT","Am.

Although this is often attributed to observation noise, factors including local environmental differences, spatially variable dynamics, and chaos might also reduce or eliminate metapopulation synchrony. To differentiate spatially variable dynamics from similar dynamics driven by spatially variable environments, we applied hierarchical delay embedding. A unique output of this approach, the dynamic correlation, quantifies similarity in intrinsic dynamics of populations, independently of whether their abundance is correlated through time. We applied these methods to 17 populations of blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) along the US Atlantic coast and found that their intrinsic dynamics were broadly similar despite largely independent fluctuations in abundance. The weight of evidence suggests that the latitudinal gradient in temperature, filtered through a unimodal response curve, is sufficient to decouple crab populations. As unimodal thermal performance is ubiquitous in ectotherms, we suggest that this may be a general explanation for the weak synchrony observed at large distances in many marine species, although additional studies are needed to test this hypothesis.","[Rogers, Tanya L.] Northeastern Univ, Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA; [Rogers, Tanya L.; Munch, Stephan B.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA","Northeastern University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Rogers, TL (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, Marine Sci Ctr, Dept Marine & Environm Sci, Nahant, MA 01908 USA.;Rogers, TL (corresponding author), NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA.","tanya.rogers@noaa.gov","","","NSF [DGE-1451070]; Lenfest Ocean Program","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Lenfest Ocean Program","This material is based upon work supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant DGE-1451070 to T.L.R. and an internship provided through the NSF Graduate Research Internship Program to T.L.R.

Using the changes in the respiratory exchange ratio (RER; CO2 excretion divided by O-2 uptake) as a proxy for changes in bodily gas stores, we quantified time constants in response to hypoxia and hypercapnia in Cuvier's dwarf caiman. We confirm distinct and prolonged changes in RER during and after exposure to hypoxia or hypercapnia. Gas exchange transients were evaluated in reference to predictions from a two-compartment model of CO2 exchange to quantify the effects of the levels of hypoxia and hypercapnia, duration of hypercapnia (30-300 min) and body temperature (23 versus 33 degrees C). For hypercapnia, the transients could be adequately fitted by two-phase exponential functions, and slow time constants (after 300 min hypercapnia) concurred reasonably well with modelling predictions. The slow time constants for the decays after hypercapnia were not affected by the level of hypercapnia, but they increased (especially at 23 degrees C) with exposure time, possibly indicating a temporal and slow recruitment of tissues for CO2 storage. In contrast to modelling predictions, elevated body temperature did not reduce the time constants, probably reflecting similar ventilation rates in transients at 23 and 33 degrees C.

The aim of this laboratory study on the terrestrial invasive gastropod Cornu aspersum was to investigate the effect of dietary calcium source on egg shell structure and heat resistance of eggs in two populations from different climatic regions of France (Western Atlantic and Mediterranean). To date no literature is known about heat stress in calcified ectothermic eggs while exposed to heat peaks using fluctuating thermal regimes and optimal humidity. In snails from the Mediterranean population fed exclusively with CaCO3 from limestone we found the thinnest egg shells and the smallest hatchlings. Limestone represents the most accessible calcium source for snails, but is, however, responsible for thinner and more mineralized egg shells (higher ash content). Hence thicker egg shells result from a low mineralized mucopolysaccharideglycoprotein matrix that could play a nutritional role for hatchlings. Exposed to heat peaks, eggs in both populations had lower incubation time variability at the detriment of hatching rate. This study highlights the need for functional studies in this invasive species to understand the effects on population dynamics of interacting biotic and abiotic environmental factors under climate and anthropic habitat changes.

Here we examine the effect of warming and its interactions with resource availability on the population dynamics of the pyralid moth Plodia interpunctella, populations of which normally show generation cycles, a consequence of strong and asymmetric age-related competition. Warming by 3 degrees C above the standard culture temperature led to substantial changes in population density, age structure, and population dynamics. Adult populations were some 50% larger in warmed populations, probably because the reduced fecundity associated with warming leads to reduced larval competition, allowing more larvae to develop to adulthood. Warming also interacted with resource availability to alter population dynamics, with the generation cycles typical of this species breaking down in the 30 degrees populations when standard laboratory diet was provided but not when a reduced nutrient poor diet was used. Warming by 6 degrees led to either rapid extinction or the persistence of populations at low densities for the duration of the experiment. We conclude that even moderate warming can have considerable effects on population structure and dynamics, potentially leading to complete changes in dynamics in some cases. These results are particularly relevant given the large number of economically important species that exhibit generation cycling, in many cases arising from similar mechanisms to those operating in P.interpunctella.","[Laughton, Alice M.; Knell, Robert J.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England","University of London; Queen Mary University London","Laughton, AM; Knell, RJ (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Biol & Chem Sci, London, England.","alicemlaughton@gmail.com; R.Knell@qmul.ac.uk","","","NERC [NE/J023787/1]","NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This study was funded by NERC grant NE/J023787/1 to RK.",NA,"51","0","0","4","10","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

There is strong consensus that low temperature is among the main drivers of SWD population distribution, and the invasion success of SWD is also linked to its thermal plasticity. Most studies on ectotherm cold tolerance focus on exposure to a single stressful temperature but here we investigated how cold stress intensity affected survival duration across a broad range of low temperatures (-7 to +3 degrees C). The analysis of Lt50 at different stressful temperatures (Thermal Death Time curve - TDT) is based on the suggestion that cold injury accumulation rate increases exponentially with the intensity of thermal stress. In accordance with the hypothesis, Lt50 of SWD decreased exponentially with temperature. Further, comparison of TDT curves from flies acclimated to 15, 19 and 23 degrees C, respectively, showed an almost full compensation with acclimation such that the temperature required to induce mortality over a fixed time decreased almost 1 degrees C per degrees C lowering of acclimation temperature. Importantly, this change in cold tolerance with acclimation was uniform across the range of moderate to intense cold stress exposures examined. To understand if cold stress at moderate and intense exposures affects the same physiological systems we examined how physiological markers/symptoms of chill injury developed at different intensities of the cold stress. Specifically, hsp23 expression and extracellular [K+] were measured in flies exposed to different intensities of cold stress (-6, -2 and +2 degrees C) and at various time points corresponding to the same progression of injury (equivalent to 1/3, 2/3 or 3/3 of Lt50). The different cold stress intensities all triggered hsp23 expression following 2 h of recovery, but patterns of expression differed. At the most intense cold stress (-6 and -2 degrees C) a gradual increase with time was found. In contrast, at +2 degrees C an initial increase was followed by a dissipating expression. A gradual perturbation of ion balance (hyperkalemia) was also found at all three cold stress intensities examined, with only slight dissimilarities between treatment temperatures. Despite some differences between the three cold intensities examined, the results generally support the hypothesis that intense and moderate cold stress induces the same physiological perturbation. This suggests that cold stress experienced during natural fluctuating conditions is additive and the results also illustrate that the rate of injury accumulation increases dramatically (exponentially) with decreasing temperature (increasing stress).","[Tarapacki, Penelope; Jorgensen, Lisa Bjerregaard; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov; Andersen, Mads Kuhlmann; Overgaard, Johannes] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Colinet, Herve] Univ Rennes, CNRS, ECOBIO, UMR 6553,Ecosyst Biodiversite Evolut, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Andersen, Mads Kuhlmann] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Aarhus University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Rennes 1; Carleton University","Overgaard, J (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.","","Overgaard, Johannes/I-7493-2013; colinet, herve/B-3677-2019; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov/J-3190-2013","Overgaard, Johannes/0000-0002-2851-4551; Jorgensen, Lisa/0000-0002-4438-4558; colinet, herve/0000-0002-8806-3107; Sorensen, Jesper Givskov/0000-0002-9149-3626","Danish Council for Independent Research|Natural Sciences","Danish Council for Independent Research|Natural Sciences(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF))","The authors would like to thank Kirsten Kromand for animal and laboratory assistance.

A key aspect of an organism's thermal performance curve (TPC)-the relationship between fitness-related trait performance and temperature-is its thermal sensitivity, i.e., the rate at which trait values increase with temperature within its typically experienced thermal range. For a given trait, the distribution of thermal sensitivities across species, often quantified as activation energy values, is typically right-skewed. Currently, the mechanisms that generate this distribution are unclear, with considerable debate about the role of thermodynamic constraints versus adaptive evolution. Here, using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we study the evolution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate across phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae) and prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), 2 microbial groups that play a major role in the global carbon cycle. We find that thermal sensitivity across these groups is moderately phylogenetically heritable, and that its distribution is shaped by repeated evolutionary convergence throughout its parameter space. More precisely, we detect bursts of adaptive evolution in thermal sensitivity, increasing the amount of overlap among its distributions in different clades. We obtain qualitatively similar results from evolutionary analyses of the thermal sensitivities of 2 physiological rates underlying growth rate: net photosynthesis and respiration of plants. Furthermore, we find that these episodes of evolutionary convergence are consistent with 2 opposing forces: decrease in thermal sensitivity due to environmental fluctuations and increase due to adaptation to stable environments. Overall, our results indicate that adaptation can lead to large and relatively rapid shifts in thermal sensitivity, especially in microbes for which rapid evolution can occur at short timescales. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to elucidating the implications of rapid evolution in organismal thermal sensitivity for ecosystem functioning.","[Kontopoulos, Dimitrios-Georgios] Imperial Coll London, Sci & Solut Changing Planet DTP, London, England; [Kontopoulos, Dimitrios-Georgios; Smith, Thomas P.; Barraclough, Timothy G.; Pawar, Samraat] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, Ascot, Berks, England; [Barraclough, Timothy G.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, Oxon, England","Imperial College London; Imperial College London; University of Oxford","Kontopoulos, DG (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Sci & Solut Changing Planet DTP, London, England.;Kontopoulos, DG (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, Ascot, Berks, England.","dgkontopoulos@gmail.com","Kontopoulos, Dimitrios - Georgios/H-5822-2019; Smith, Tom/AAH-3263-2021","Kontopoulos, Dimitrios - Georgios/0000-0002-5082-1929; Smith, Tom/0000-0002-4038-9722; Pawar, Samraat/0000-0001-8375-5684; Barraclough, Timothy/0000-0002-8084-2640","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L002515/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) DTP scholarship [BB/J014575/1]; NERC [NE/M004740/1, NE/M020843/1]","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) DTP scholarship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","DGK was supported by a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) scholarship (NE/L002515/1; http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp? pcode=NE%2FL002515%2F1).

To address this issue we determined whole-animal fractional rates of protein synthesis (k(s)) in four dominant species of gammarid amphipods with different distributions along the coasts of Western Europe from arctic to temperate latitudes. Up to three populations of each species were collected in the summer and k(s) measured within 48 h. Summer k(s) values were relatively high in the temperate species, Gammarus locusta, from Portugal (48 degrees N) and Wales (53 degrees N) and were maintained across latitudes by the conservation of translational efficiency. In sharp contrast, summer k(s). remained remarkably low in the boreal/temperate species G. duebeni from Wales, Scotland (58 degrees N) and Tromso (70 degrees N), probably as a temporary energy saving strategy to ensure survival in rapidly fluctuating environments of the high intertidal. Values for k(s) increased in acclimated G. duebeni from Scotland and Tromso showing a lack of compensation with latitude. In the subarctic/boreal species, G. oceanicus, summer k(s) remained unchanged in Scotland and Tromso but fell significantly in Svalbard (79 degrees N) at 5 degrees C, despite a slight increase in RNA content. At 79 degrees N, mean k(s) was 4.5 times higher in the circumpolar species G. setosus than in G. oceanicus due to a doubling in RNA content. The relationship between whole-animal protein synthesis rates and natural thermal gradients is complex, varies between species and appears to be associated with local temperatures and their variability, as well as changes in other environmental factors.","[Rastrick, Samuel P.

The possible functions of such structures are manifold, but their paucity in extant animals has frustrated their adaptive explanation. We recently discovered the first helical reptile burrows, created by the monitor lizard Varanus panoptes. The plugged burrows terminated in nest chambers that were the deepest known of any vertebrate, and by far the deepest of any reptile (mean=2.3m, range=1.0-3.6m, N=52). A significant positive relationship between soil moisture and nest depth persisted at depths >1m, suggesting that deep nesting in V.panoptes may be an evolutionary response to egg desiccation during the long (approximately8months) dry season incubation period. Alternatively, lizards may avoid shallower nesting because even slight daily temperature fluctuations are detrimental to developing embryos; our data show that this species may have the most stable incubation environment of any reptile and possibly any ectotherm. Soil-filled burrows do not support the hypothesis generated for Daimonelix that the helix would provide more consistent temperature and humidity as a result of limited air circulation in dry palaeoclimates. We suggest that Daimonelix were used mainly for nesting or rearing young, because helical burrows of extant vertebrates are generally associated with a nest. The extraordinary nesting in this lizard reflects a system in which adaptive hypotheses for the function of fossil helical burrows can be readily tested.","[Doody, J.

Although both species have rather similar biological characteristics, they differ in their invasion patterns. ALB shows numerous, but local, outbreaks in urban areas of North-East America, Western and Central Europe, whereas CLB has colonized a large part of Northern Italy. Temperature is pivotal in setting distribution limits of ectotherms. Low temperature may be limiting for larvae since they are the main overwintering stage for both species. To investigate whether differential cold tolerance may contribute to setting the respective limits of the range invaded by each species, we monitored larval metabolic rate before and after exposure to a one-week ecologically relevant moderate cold stress (-2/ + 2 degrees C, 14/10 h). We tested two distinctive fluctuating regimes before the cold exposure to check whether larval acclimation significantly altered their cold tolerance. Survival was high in all conditions for both species. Visual examination showed temporary locomotor inactivity during the stress but respiration rates were not altered after the stress suggesting that larvae could rapidly resume their initial metabolic activity. The respiration rate was globally higher in ALB than in CLB. Together, these results tend to indicate that both species have similar tolerance to the moderate cold stress tested, but also that ALB may be better at maintaining metabolic activity at cold than CLB. These observed differences could affect phenology in both species and in turn their establishment potential.","[Javal, M.; Roques, A.; Roux, G.; Laparie, M.] INRA, UR0633, Zool Forestiere, F-45075 Orleans, France; [Roux, G.] Univ Orleans, F-45075 Orleans, France; [Laparie, M.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res NINA, Arctic Ecol Dept, Fram Ctr, N-9296 Tromso, Norway","INRAE; Universite de Orleans; Norwegian Institute Nature Research","Javal, M (corresponding author), INRA, UR0633, Zool Forestiere, F-45075 Orleans, France.","marion.javal@gmail.com","Javal, Marion/R-1754-2019","Javal, Marion/0000-0001-7878-2936; Roux, Geraldine/0000-0002-1116-2799","French Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry [DGAL E07/2014]; Region Centre Val de Loire [2014 00095480]","French Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; Region Centre Val de Loire(Region Centre-Val de Loire)","We warmly thank Franck Herard and Nathalie Ramualde for providing living larvae and sharing methods and diet recipe to rear them, and Claudine Courtin for her help with the breeding.

Daily entrained endogenous rhythms may serve as energy-conserving mechanisms during an animal's active or inactive phase. However, because nocturnal lizards often take advantage of thermal opportunities during the photophase ( light), their daily metabolic rhythms may be less pronounced than those of diurnal species. We measured the rate of oxygen consumption (<(V)over dot > O-2). as an index of metabolic rate of eight temperate lizard species ( four nocturnal, three diurnal, and one crepuscular/diurnal; n = 7-14) over 24 h at 13 degrees C and in constant darkness to test whether daily patterns (including amplitude, magnitude, and time of peak <(V)over dot >)O-2 of metabolic rate in lizards differ with activity. period. We also tested for phylogenetic differences in metabolic rate between skinks and geckos. Three daily patterns were evident: 24-h cycle, 12-h cycle, or no daily cycle. The skink Cyclodina aenea has a 12-h crepuscular pattern of oxygen consumption. In four other species, <(V)over dot > O-2 increased with, or in. anticipation of, the active part of the day, but three species had rhythms offset from their active phase. Although not correlated with activity period or phylogeny, amplitude of <(V)over dot > O-2 may be correlated with whether a species is temperate or tropical. In conclusion, the metabolic rate of many species does not always correlate with the recorded activity period. The dichotomy of ecology and physiology may be clarified by more in-depth studies of species behaviors and activity periods.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Integrat Physiol Res Grp, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington; University of Sydney","Hare, KM (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.","kelly.hare@vuw.ac.nz","Hare, Kelly/B-3696-2008; Thompson, Mike/ABA-8716-2020","Hare, Kelly/0000-0002-9473-5256; Thompson, Michael/0000-0002-2496-992X","","","",NA,"59","25","26","0","31","UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","CHICAGO","1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","1522-2152","1537-5293","","PHYSIOL BIOCHEM ZOOL","Physiol.

Field biologists often use erythrocyte metrics to assess wildlife health but need baseline values to distinguish normal variations from disease or chronic stress. Here we characterise erythrocyte types and features of P. geometricus and assess if age, sex and environmental fluctuations influence their frequencies and metrics. We collected blood from males, females and juveniles over four seasons to prepare smears for cytological evaluation. We treated the smears with May-Grunwald-Giemsa stains and used imaging software to measure size, shape and colour intensity of erythrocyte types. The blood of all groups contained immature, mature and senescent erythrocytes, and the appearance of each cell type corresponded to descriptions for other chelonians. Season had a strong effect on the occurrence of erythrocyte types and features with few group differences. The frequency of immature erythrocytes was high in winter and spring, the wet season, reflecting increased erythropoiesis. Mature erythrocytes dominated in summer and autumn, but frequencies of senescent cells, poikilocytosis, cytoplasmic inclusions and cytoplasmic vacuoles increased in autumn, indicating that water and food shortages caused physiological stress. The small size and elongated shape of summer and autumn erythrocytes would facilitate oxygen exchange when high temperatures increase metabolic needs of ectotherms. Lower temperatures and energy demands in the wet season counter the lower oxygen capacity of round, immature cells. Our results provide baseline information on erythrocyte physiology and metrics for health assessments of geometric tortoises.","[Walton, Shasheen; Hofmeyr, Margaretha] Univ Western Cape, Chelonian Biodivers & Conservat Southern Africa, Biodivers & Conservat Biol Dept, Robert Sobukwe Rd, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa","University of the Western Cape","Hofmeyr, M (corresponding author), Univ Western Cape, Chelonian Biodivers & Conservat Southern Africa, Biodivers & Conservat Biol Dept, Robert Sobukwe Rd, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.","mdhofmeyr@gmail.com","","","National Research Foundation of South Africa; Royal Society of London; University of the Western Cape","National Research Foundation of South Africa(National Research Foundation - South Africa); Royal Society of London(Royal Society of London); University of the Western Cape","The research was done under permits 176&923/2000, and 280&1027/2001 issued by the Western Cape Nature Conservation Board, and ethical clearance of project number 96/10/15 of the University of the Western Cape.

Here, we investigated the thermal vulnerability of two mangrove crab species, comparing populations at the centre (Kenya) and edge (South Africa) of their distributions. At the same time, we investigated the role of respiratory mode (water- versus air-breathing) in determining the thermal tolerance in amphibious organisms. To do this, we compared the vulnerability to acute temperature fluctuations of two sympatric species with two different lifestyle adaptations: the free living Perisesarma guttatum and the burrowing Uca urvillei, both pivotal to the ecosystem functioning of mangroves. The results revealed the air-breathing U. urvillei to be a thermal generalist with much higher thermal tolerances than P. guttatum. Importantly, however, we found that, while U. urvillei showed little difference between edge and centre populations, P. guttatum showed adaptation to local conditions. Equatorial populations had elevated tolerances to acute heat stress and mechanisms of partial thermoregulation, which make them less vulnerable to global warming than temperate conspecifics. The results reveal both the importance of respiratory mode to thermal tolerance and the unexpected potential for low latitude populations/species to endure a warming climate. The results also contribute to a conceptual model on the latitudinal thermal tolerance of these key species. This highlights the need for an integrated population-level approach to predict the consequences of climate change.","[Fusi, Marco; Daffonchio, Daniele] KAUST, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Fusi, Marco] Univ Milan, Dept Food Environm & Nutr Sci DeFENS, IT-20133 Milan, Italy; [Giomi, Folco] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, Dept Integrat Ecophysiol, Bremerhaven, Germany; [Babbini, Simone; Cannicci, Stefano] Univ Florence, Dept Biol, Florence, Italy; [McQuaid, Christopher D.; Porri, Francesca] Rhodes Univ, Dept Zool & Entomol, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Porri, Francesca] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; University of Milan; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Florence; Rhodes University; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity","Fusi, M (corresponding author), KAUST, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.","marco.fusi@kaust.edu.sa","Daffonchio, Daniele/AAF-4922-2019; Cannicci, Stefano/N-8512-2019; McQuaid, Christopher/AAT-3725-2020; Porri, Francesca/M-4258-2017; Cannicci, Stefano/L-7136-2015","Daffonchio, Daniele/0000-0003-0947-925X; Cannicci, Stefano/0000-0002-6544-0213; McQuaid, Christopher/0000-0002-3473-8308; Porri, Francesca/0000-0001-8247-4506; Cannicci, Stefano/0000-0002-6544-0213","Italian MIUR funds; SP3-People (Marie Curie) IRSES Project CREC [247514]; Intra-European Fellowship [221017]; South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Dept of Science and Technology; National Research Foundation; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","Italian MIUR funds(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); SP3-People (Marie Curie) IRSES Project CREC; Intra-European Fellowship; South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Dept of Science and Technology; National Research Foundation; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology)","The study was supported by Italian MIUR funds (Cannicci ex 60%) and the SP3-People (Marie Curie) IRSES Project CREC (no. 247514).

To buffer these fluctuations, ectotherms use different strategies, including the integument, which is a barrier that minimizes temperature exchange between the inner body and the surrounding air. In lizards, this barrier is constituted by keratinized scales of variable size, shape and texture, and its main function is protection, water loss avoidance and thermoregulation. The size of scales in lizards has been proposed to vary in relation to climatic gradients; however, it has also been observed that in some groups of Iguanian lizards it could be related to phylogeny. Thus, here, we studied the area and number of scales (dorsal and ventral) of 60 species of Liolaemus lizards distributed in a broad latitudinal and altitudinal gradient to determine the nature of the variation of the scales with climate, and found that the number and size of scales are related to climatic variables, such as temperature and geographical variables as altitude. The evolutionary process that best explained how these morphological variables evolved was the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model. The number of scales seemed to be related to common ancestry, whereas dorsal and ventral scale areas seemed to vary as a consequence of ecological traits. In fact, the ventral area is less exposed to climate conditions such as ultraviolet radiation or wind and is, thus, under less pressure to change in response to alterations in external conditions. It is possible that scale ornamentation, such as keels and granulosity, may bring some more information in this regard.","[Jose Tulli, Maria] Fdn Miguel Lillo, Inst Herpetol, Unidad Ejecutora Lillo UEL CONICET, Miguel Lillo 251, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Cruz, Felix B.] CONICET UNCOMA, Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Medioambiente INIBIOM, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Miguel Lillo Foundation; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional del Comahue","Tulli, MJ (corresponding author), Fdn Miguel Lillo, Inst Herpetol, Unidad Ejecutora Lillo UEL CONICET, Miguel Lillo 251, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina.","majotulli@gmail.com","","Cruz, Felix/0000-0002-2475-1429"," [PICT 2013/2301]","","We are very thankful to Regina Medina and Cecilia Robles.

But whether such adaptation influences the phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance when encountering further environmental stressors is not clear yet. This is crucial to understand because organisms experience multiple stressors, besides warming climate, in their natural environment and pollution is one of those. Here, we studied the phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance in three-spined stickleback populations inhabiting spatially replicated thermally polluted and pristine areas before and after exposing them to a sublethal concentration of copper for one week. We found that the upper thermal tolerance and its phenotypic plasticity after copper exposure did not depend on the thermal history of fish, suggesting that five decades of thermal pollution did not result in evolutionary adaptation to thermal tolerance. The upper thermal tolerance of fish was, on the other hand, increased by similar to 1.5 degrees C after 1-week copper exposure in a sex-specific manner, with males having higher plasticity. To our knowledge this is the first study that shows an improvement of the upper thermal tolerance as a result of metal exposure. The results suggest that three-spined sticklebacks are having high plasticity and they are capable of surviving in a multiple-stressor scenario in the wild and that male sticklebacks seem more resilient to fluctuating environmental conditions than female.","[Mottola, Giovanna; Nikinmaa, Mikko; Anttila, Katja] Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Vesilinnantie 5, Turku 20500, Finland","University of Turku","Mottola, G (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Vesilinnantie 5, Turku 20500, Finland.","giomot@utu.fi","Nikinmaa, Mikko/AAZ-2803-2021","Anttila, Katja/0000-0002-0128-0943; Mottola, Giovanna/0000-0001-7823-9271","Doctoral School of Biology, Geography and Geology, University of Turku; Turku University Foundation; Turku Collegium for Science and Medicine; Kone Foundation","Doctoral School of Biology, Geography and Geology, University of Turku; Turku University Foundation; Turku Collegium for Science and Medicine; Kone Foundation","We thank Teollisuuden Voima and Fortum for the permission to access the nuclear power plant areas and providing water temperature data.

This generalizes earlier work involving only pure heat conduction and underlines the incomparability of the internal energy and adiabatic potentials when expressed as powers of the adiabatic variable. In an L-potential equilibration, the final state will be one of maximum entropy, whereas in an entropy equilibration, the final state will be one of minimum L. Unlike classical equilibrium thermodynamic phase space, which lacks an intrinsic metric structure insofar as distances and other geometrical concepts do not have an intrinsic thermodynamic significance in such spaces, a metric space can be constructed for the power means: the distance between means of different order is related to the Carnot efficiency. In the ideal classical gas limit, the average change in the entropy is shown to be proportional to the difference between the Shannon and Renyi entropies for nonextensive systems that are multifractal in nature. The L potential, like the internal energy, is a Schur convex function of the empirical temperature, which satisfies Jensen's inequality, and serves as a measure of the tendency to uniformity in processes involving pure thermal conduction.","Univ Camerino, I-62032 Camerino, MC, Italy","University of Camerino","Lavenda, BH (corresponding author), Univ Camerino, I-62032 Camerino, MC, Italy.","bernard.lavenda@unicam.it","","","","","",NA,"22","3","3","0","1","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0028-1042","","","NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN","Naturwissenschaften","NOV","2005","92","11","",NA,"",NA,"523","531","","10.1007/s00114-005-0038-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-005-0038-1","","","9","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","987LY","16228240","Green Submitted","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000233520600004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Insects primarily consume lipids during winter, but may also use carbohydrate and proteins as fuel. Because they are ectotherms, the metabolic rate of insects is temperature-dependent, and the curvilinear nature of the metabolic rate-temperature relationship means that warm temperatures are disproportionately important to overwinter energy use. This energy use may be reduced physiologically, by reducing the slope or elevation of the metabolic rate-temperature relationship, or because of threshold changes, such as metabolic suppression upon freezing. Insects may also choose microhabitats or life history stages that reduce the impact of overwinter energy drain. There is considerable capacity for overwinter energy drain to affect insect survival and performance both directly (via starvation) or indirectly (for example, through a trade-off with cryoprotection), but this has not been well-explored. Likewise, the impact of overwinter energy drain on growing-season performance is not well understood.

Expression of Hsp70 enhances thermal tolerance and represents a key strategy for ectotherms to tolerate elevated temperature in nature. Synthesis of these proteins, together with other physiological responses to elevated temperatures, increases energy demands. A positive association between multiple and single locus heterozygosity (MLH and SLH, respectively) and individual fitness has been widely demonstrated. In molluscs, MLH can decrease routine metabolic rates and improve energetic status. juvenile Concholepas concholepas live in the intertidal zone and are constantly exposed to temperature fluctuations. Thus, these young individuals are exposed both to thermal risks and the large metabolic costs required to cope with thermal stress. We evaluated the effects of allozyme MLH and SLH on basal (control animals) and induced (stressed animals) levels of the Hsp70 in juveniles C concholepas. juveniles (n=400) were acclimated at 16 degrees C for 2 weeks; then 100 animals were exposed to 24 degrees C (stress) and 100 were kept at 16 degrees C (control) for 2 and 7 days. The variability of 20 loci was analyzed by starch gel electrophoresis. For SLH effects we used 7 polymorphic loci. We quantified expression of Hsp70 by Western blot analyses. Hsp70 expression increased markedly (similar to 90%) with temperature. We found a positive association between MLH and basal and induced levels of Hsp70 in the 2-day exposure experiment. Regardless of temperature, Hsp70 levels increased with MLH (r(2) = 0.7 and 0.9, for basal and induced levels, respectively) reaching maximal levels in juveniles with intermediate and high MLH levels (2 and 3 loci). and decreasing slightly (but not significantly) in juveniles with highest MLH (?:4 heterozygous loci). However, after 7 days of exposure to thermal stress, less heterozygous juveniles attained the same levels of Hsp70 than more heterozygous juveniles. Given the faster increment of Hsp70 in C. concholepas juveniles with intermediate-high levels of MLH, these individuals could be less affected by thermal stress in the intertidal zone. We found an association between specific loci genotype and higher Hsp70 levels (basal or induced). In comparison to homozygous juveniles, heterozygous juveniles for several loci showed higher Hsp70. However, these associations were not for the same loci in juveniles exposed to high temperature for 2 and 7 days. This suggests genotypic variation at some allozyme loci could be more important in the period of initial response to high temperature and others can be more important in the response to the chronic temperature stress.

Marine intertidal organisms possess the ability to cope in the short term with environmental fluctuations exceeding predicted values. However, how they will cope with chronic exposure to elevated temperature and pCO(2) is virtually unknown. In addition, individuals from the same species/population often show remarkable levels of variation in their responses to complex climatic changes: in particular, variation in metabolic rates often is linked to differences in individuals' performances and fitness. Despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, inter-individual variation has rarely been investigated within the context of climatic changes, and most investigations have typically employed orthogonal experimental designs paired to analyses of independent samples. Although this is undoubtedly a powerful and useful approach, it may not be the most appropriate for understanding all alterations of biological functions in response to environmental changes. An individual approach arguably should be favored when trying to describe organisms' responses to climatic change. Consequently, to test which approach had the greater power to discriminate the intensity and direction of an organism's response to complex climatic changes, we investigated the extracellular osmo/iono-regulatory abilities, upper thermal tolerances (UTTs), and metabolic rates of individual adults of an intertidal amphipod, Echinogammarus marinus, exposed for 15 days to combined elevated temperature and pCO(2). The individual approach led to stronger and different predictions on how ectotherms will likely respond to ongoing complex climatic change, compared with the independent approaches. Consequently, this may call into question the relevance, or even the validity, of some of the predictions made to date. Finally, we argue that treating individual differences as biologically meaningful can lead to a better understanding of the physiological responses themselves and the selective processes that will occur with complex climatic changes; selection will likely play a crucial role in defining species' responses to future environmental changes. Individuals with higher metabolic rates were also characterized by greater extracellular osmo/iono-regulative abilities and higher UTTs, and thus there appeared to be no evolutionary trade-offs between these functions. However, as individuals with greater metabolic rates also have greater costs for maintenance and repair, and likely a lower fraction of energy available for growth and reproduction, trade-offs between life-history and physiological performance may still arise.","[Calosi, P.; Turner, L.

Yet, it remains unclear how populations embedded within biological communities will respond to climate warming in thermally variable environments, particularly as climate change alters existing patterns of thermal spatial and temporal variability. As environmental temperatures increase above historical ranges, organisms may increasingly rely on extreme habitats to effectively thermoregulate. Such locations desirable in their thermal attributes (e.g., thermal refugia) are often suboptimal for resource acquisition (e.g., underground tunnels). Thus, via the expected increase in both mean temperatures and diel thermal variation, climate warming may heighten the trade-off for consumers between behaviors maximizing thermal performance and those maximizing resource acquisition. Here, we integrate behavioral, physiological, and trophic ecology to provide a general framework for understanding how temporal thermal variation, mediated by access to a thermal refugium, alters the response of consumer-resource systems to warming. We use this framework to predict how temporal variation and access to thermal refugia affect the persistence of consumers and resources during climate warming, how the quality of thermal refugia impact consumer-resource systems, and how consumer-resource systems with fast vs. slow ecological dynamics respond to warming. Our results show that the spatial thermal variability provided by refugia can elevate consumer biomass at warmer temperatures despite reducing the fraction of time consumers spend foraging, that temporal variability detrimentally impacts consumers at high environmental temperatures, and that consumer-resource systems with fast ecological dynamics are most vulnerable to climate warming. Thus, incorporating both estimates of thermal variability and species interactions may be necessary to accurately predict how populations respond to warming.","[Fey, Samuel B.; Vasseur, David A.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA","Yale University","Fey, SB (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.","Samuel.fey@yale.edu","","Vasseur, David/0000-0003-1706-9613","A James S.

If the velocity has correlations growing with the distance (a turbulent flow), then the large distance correlations depend in a crucial way on the scaling index of the turbulent flow.

Although most studies have assessed the effect of increasing mean temperatures on individual performances, the response to temporal thermal variations, including the magnitude and frequency of extreme temperatures, has often been overlooked. 2 In the present study, we hypothesized that insect performances increase with increasing mean temperatures but decrease under more variable thermal conditions. We used a manipulative experiment to compare the longevity and weight variation of Monochamus galloprovincialis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) under three climatic conditions in which the mean and variance of daily temperatures were both controlled. This insect is vector of the invasive nematode, Bursapheluncus xylophilus, which is the causal agent of the pine wilt disease, one of the major threats to pine forests in Europe. 3 Our results showed that an increase of 2.5 degrees C in average temperature had no effect on the survivorship and weight variations of the beetle. By contrast, larger fluctuating variations of temperature across year resulted in significantly lower longevity, whereas weight remained unchanged. 4 The results of the present study suggest that the effect of global warming on the survival of M. galloprovincialis is likely to be driven by change in temperature stability rather than by change in mean temperature.","[David, Guillaume; Giffard, Brice; Piou, Dominique; Jactel, Herve] INRA, BIOGECO UMR1202, 69 Route Arcachon, F-33610 Cestas, France; [David, Guillaume; Giffard, Brice; Piou, Dominique; Jactel, Herve] Univ Bordeaux, BIOGECO UMR1202, F-33600 Pessac, France; [Giffard, Brice] Univ Bordeaux, Bordeaux Sci Agro, 1 Cours Gen Gaulle, F-33170 Gradignan, France; [Piou, Dominique] Minist Agr Alimentat & Peche, Dept Sante Forets, DGAL SDQPV, 251 Rue Vaugirard, F-75732 Paris, France; [Roques, Alain] INRA, UR 0633, Zool Forestiere, 2163 Ave Pomme Pin,CS 40001, F-45075 Orleans, France","INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; INRAE","David, G (corresponding author), INRA, BIOGECO UMR1202, 69 Route Arcachon, F-33610 Cestas, France.;David, G (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, BIOGECO UMR1202, F-33600 Pessac, France.","david.guillaume27@gmail.com","DAVID, Guillaume/GXZ-9649-2022; David, Guillaume/AAH-5138-2021","David, Guillaume/0000-0002-2692-0409; Giffard, Brice/0000-0003-4367-1245","French Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7 via the Project REPHRAME [265483]","French Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; European Union Seventh Framework Programme FP7 via the Project REPHRAME","We are grateful to Fabrice Vetillard for his help with the management of climatic chambers and the feeding of beetles.

A constant wall heat flux is applied and the temperature range within the flow domain incorporates the thermodynamic region where large variations in thermophysical properties occur. The contribution of these property variations on the mean flow is studied. As compared to ideal gas heat transfer, additional terms appear in the mean flow governing equations. These terms can significantly affect the energy balance, because they modify the averaged wall heat flux and the enthalpy diffusion close to the pipe wall. Furthermore, the averaged thermophysical properties, especially the isobaric heat capacity c(p), deviate significantly from those evaluated using the mean temperature or enthalpy. This is due to an averaging artifact called the Jensen inequality, caused by the enthalpy fluctuations and the non-linear dependence of thermophysical properties with respect to enthalpy. Turbulent statistics for one forced convection and two mixed convection cases in an upward flow are discussed. A decrease in turbulent kinetic energy is observed for the forced convection and the low buoyancy case, which cause heat transfer deterioration indicated by high wall temperatures. For the high buoyancy case the turbulence activity first reduces (heat transfer deterioration) and then increases due to turbulence recovery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the thermodynamic properties that underlie biochemical kinetics and protein stability determine the overall thermal sensitivity of rate processes. Consequently, a single quantitative framework can assess variation in thermal sensitivity of ectotherms in terms of single amino acid substitutions, quantitative genetics, and interspecific differences. Thermodynamic considerations predict that higher optimal temperatures will result in greater maximal fitness at the optimum, a pattern seen both in interspecific comparisons and in within-population genotypic variation. Second, the temperature-size rule (increased developmental temperature causes decreased adult body size) is a common pattern of phenotypic plasticity in ectotherms. Mechanistic models can correctly predict the rule in some taxa, but lab and field studies show that rapid evolution can weaken or even break the rule. Third, phenotypic and evolutionary models for thermal sensitivity can be combined to explore potential fitness consequences of climate warming for terrestrial ectotherms. Recent analyses suggest that climate change will have greater negative fitness consequences for tropical than for temperate ectotherms, because many tropical species have relatively narrow thermal breadths and smaller thermal safety margins.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Kingsolver, JG (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.","jgking@bio.unc.edu","","","National Science Foundation [IOB-0212798, EF-0328594, IOS-0641179]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","Many colleagues provided valuable discussion, access to published or unpublished results or figures, and useful comments on the manuscript, including M.

As hypogean organisms experience minimal thermal variation in their native biotopes, they should not be able to develop any particular cold adaptations to cope with thermal fluctuations. Indeed, physiological responses of organisms to an environmental stress are proportional to the amplitude of the stress they endure in their habitats. Surprisingly, previous studies have shown that a population of an aquatic hypogean crustacean, Niphargus rhenorhodanensis, exhibited a high level of cold hardiness. Subterranean environments thus appeared not to be following the classical above-mentioned theory. To confirm this counter-example, we studied seven karstic populations of N. rhenorhodanensis living in aquifers at approximately 10 degrees C all year round and we analysed their behavioural, metabolic and biochemical responses during cold exposure (3 degrees C). These seven populations showed reduced activities, and some cryoprotective molecules were accumulated. More surprisingly, the amplitude of the response varied greatly among the seven populations, despite their exposure to similar thermal conditions. Thus, the overall relationship that can be established between the amplitude of thermal variations and cold-hardiness abilities of ectotherm species may be more complex in subterranean crustaceans than in other arthropods.","[Colson-Proch, Celine; Douady, Christophe J.; Hervant, Frederic] Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5023, Equipe Hydrobiol & Ecol Souterraine, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France; [Renault, David] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR6553, Equipe Paysages Changements Climat Biodiversite, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Gravot, Antoine] INRA, UMR118, F-35653 Le Rheu, France; [Douady, Christophe J.] Inst Univ France, F-75005 Paris, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Rennes 1; INRAE; Institut Universitaire de France","Colson-Proch, C (corresponding author), Univ Lyon 1, CNRS, UMR5023, Equipe Hydrobiol & Ecol Souterraine, F-69622 Villeurbanne, France.","celine.colson@ens-lyon.org","Douady, Christophe/N-3069-2019; Douady, Christophe J/N-1357-2014","Douady, Christophe/0000-0002-4503-8040; Douady, Christophe J/0000-0002-4503-8040; RENAULT, David/0000-0003-3644-1759; Gravot, Antoine/0000-0001-9125-1494","Universities Claude Bernard - Lyon 1 and Beaulieu - Rennes 1; National Centre of French Scientific Research (CNRS) [IFR41]","Universities Claude Bernard - Lyon 1 and Beaulieu - Rennes 1; National Centre of French Scientific Research (CNRS)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS))","This research was supported by funds from Universities Claude Bernard - Lyon 1 and Beaulieu - Rennes 1 and from the IFR41 of the National Centre of French Scientific Research (CNRS).

The present study focused on the links between stress (ROS) signals, nuclear (n) and cytoplasmic (c) HSF-1/HIF-1 levels, and stress gene expression on mRNA and protein levels (e.g. heat-shock protein 90, HSP90) upon acute heat and ROS (H2O2) stress. ResultsAcute heat stress (30 degrees C) evoked fluctuations in ROS level. Different feeding regimens, which affected the glutathione (GSH) level, allowed altering the frequency of ROS fluctuations. Other data showed fluctuation frequency to depend also on ROS production rate. The heat-induced slow or fast ROS fluctuations (at high or low GSH levels) evoked slow or fast fluctuations in the levels of nHIF-1, nHSF-1 and gene products (mRNAs and protein), albeit after different time delays. Time delays to ROS fluctuations were, for example,shorter for nHIF-1 than for nHSF-1 fluctuations, and nHIF-1 fluctuations preceded and nHSF-1 fluctuations followed fluctuations in HSP90 mRNA level. Cytoplasmic TF levels either changed little (cHIF-1) or showed a steady increase (cHSF-1). Applying acute H2O2 stress (at 20 degrees C) revealed effects on nHIF-1 and mRNA levels, but no significant effects on nHSF-1 level. Transcriptome data additionally showed coordinated fluctuations of mRNA levels upon acute heat stress, involving mRNAs for HSPs and other stress proteins, with all corresponding genes carrying DNA binding motifs for HIF-1 and HSF-1. ConclusionsThis study provided evidence for promoting effects of ROS and HIF-1 on early haemoglobin, HIF-1 and HSP90 mRNA expressions upon heat or ROS stress. The increasing cHSF-1 level likely affected nHSF-1 level and later HSP90 mRNA expression. SignificanceHeat stress evoked ROS fluctuations, with this stress signal forwarded via nHIF-1 and nHSF-1 fluctuations to stress gene expression. The frequency of ROS fluctuations seemed to integrate information about ROS productionrate and GSH antioxidant buffer capacity, resulting in stress protein expression of different speed. Results of this study suggest ROS as early (pre-damage) and protein defects as later (post-damage) stress signals to trigger heat stress responses.","[Klumpen, Eva; Hoffschroeer, Nadine; Zeis, Bettina; Gigengack, Ulrike; Dohmen, Elias; Paul, Ruediger J.] WWU Munster, Inst Zoophysiol, Munster, Germany","University of Munster","Paul, RJ (corresponding author), WWU Munster, Inst Zoophysiol, Munster, Germany.","paulr@uni-muenster.de","Paul, Rüdiger/ABG-3698-2020; Dohmen, Elias/V-6713-2019","Dohmen, Elias/0000-0002-7203-2314; Hoffschroer, Nadine/0000-0001-7685-5804","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [Pa 308/15-1]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This study was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG grant Pa 308/15-1).",NA,"70","42","42","1","49","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0248-4900","1768-322X","","BIOL CELL","Biol.

As a result, males are exposed to larger fluctuations in environmental conditions without the protection of a permanent retreat. Body temperatures (T-b) of active male tarantulas (Aphonopelma anax) encountered fortuitously in the field ranged from 24.7 to 35.1degreesC and preferred T-b's measured in a laboratory thermal gradient ranged from 22.1 to 31.3degreesC. The thermal options available to males at random points in their environment varied substantially throughout the day but temperatures typically exceeded 40degreesC. In comparison, temperatures within burrows remained below 40degreesC. Indices calculated from these temperature data suggested that males thermoregulated effectively during the day, while environmental temperatures were within their preferred T-b range at night and so active regulation of T-b was unnecessary. In addition, I determined the exact times that males ceased locomotory activity in the morning (retreat) and when they started activity in the evening (emergence). Data from 23 radio-tagged males indicated that they retreated into temporary burrows between 06:47 and 10:53 CST. Activity commenced again between 16:36 and 20:53 CST as temperatures approached their preferred or selected T-b range.","Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Zool, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater","Shillington, C (corresponding author), Eastern Michigan Univ, Dept Biol, 316 Mark Jefferson, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 USA.","cara.shillington@emich.edu","","","","","",NA,"55","19","20","1","26","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING","OTTAWA","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA","0008-4301","1480-3283","","CAN J ZOOL","Can.

The predicted mean velocity and wall temperature have an excellent agreement with the experimental data. Using a new scaling method, both the dimensionless velocity and temperature profiles show the trend of the laminarization due to the flow acceleration induced by strong heating. Effect of the Jensen inequality on mean properties can be neglected in this turbulent flow. The analysis of turbulent statistics shows that the flow acceleration is the major cause of turbulence attenuation in the strongly heated air flow. Also the buoyancy against flow direction has a suppressive contribution to the turbulence and heat transfer. The decomposition of the skin friction and Nusselt number illustrates that the turbulent contribution to the skin friction persistently decreases and laminar contribution increases along the streamwise direction, while the laminar contribution to the Nusselt number is dominant except in the entrance where the inhomogeneous contribution is dominant due to the quick development of the thermal boundary layer. The quadrant analysis shows that the events of sweep (cold fluids moving towards the wall) and ejection (hot fluids moving away from the wall) dominate the turbulent statistics. The coherent structures are persistently decreasing and slowly moving away from the wall along the streamwise direction due to the flow acceleration and buoyancy. Moreover, the predicted instantaneous coherent structures based on Q-criterion and streamwise vorticity also confirm that conclusion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Using functional and comparative genomics approaches, we here investigated whether signatures of genomic adaptation to a set of environmental parameters are concentrated in specific subsets of genes and functions in lacertid lizards and other vertebrates. We first identify 200 genes with signatures of positive diversifying selection from transcriptomes of 24 species of lacertid lizards and demonstrate their involvement in physiological and morphological adaptations to climate. To understand how functionally similar these genes are to previously predicted candidate functions for climate adaptation and to compare them with other vertebrate species, we then performed a meta-analysis of 1,100 genes under selection obtained from -omics studies in vertebrate species adapted to different abiotic factors. We found that the vertebrate gene set formed a tightly connected interactome, which was to 23% enriched in previously predicted functions of adaptation to climate, and to a large part (18%) involved in organismal stress response. We found a much higher degree of identical genes being repeatedly selected among different animal groups (43.6%), and of functional similarity and post-translational modifications than expected by chance, and no clear functional division between genes used for ectotherm and endotherm physiological strategies. In total, 171 out of 200 genes of Lacertidae were part of this network. These results highlight an important role of a comparatively small set of genes and their functions in environmental adaptation and narrow the set of candidate pathways and markers to be used in future research on adaptation and stress response related to climate change.","[Valero, Katharina C.

Four physiological parameters-body temperature (T-b), preferred temperature (T-pref), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and critical thermal minimum (CTmin)-were evaluated to analyze the variation of thermophysiological traits among these populations that inhabit different environmental and altitudinal conditions. We also evaluate the availability of operative temperatures, warming tolerance, and thermal safety margin of each population to estimate their possible risks in the face of future raising temperatures. Similar to previous studies, our results suggest that some physiological traits (CTmax and T-b) are influenced by environmental heterogeneity, which brings changes on the thermoregulatory behavior. Other parameters (T-pref and CTmin), may be also influenced by phylogenetic constraints. Moreover, the fluctuating air temperature (T-air) as well as the operative temperatures (T-e) showed that these lizards exploit a variety of thermal microenvironments, which may facilitate behavioral thermoregulation. Warming tolerance and thermal safety margin analyses suggest that both species find thermal refugia and remain active without reducing their performance or undergoing thermal stress within their habitats.

Theory predicts that ectotherms should respond to increased thermal variability by lowering the thermal sensitivity of metabolism, which will reduce the impact of the warm portion of thermal variability. We examined the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate of overwintering Erynnis propertius (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) larvae from a stable or variable environment reared in the laboratory in a reciprocal common garden design, and used these data to model energy use during the winters of 1973-2010 using meteorological data to predict the energetic outcomes of metabolic compensation and phenological shifts. Larvae that experienced variable temperatures had decreased thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate, and were larger than those reared at stable temperatures, which could partially compensate for the increased energetic demands. Even with depressed thermal sensitivity, the variable environment was more energy-demanding than the stable, with the majority of this demand occurring in autumn. Autumn phenology changes thus had disproportionate influence on energy consumption in variable environments, and variable-reared larvae were most susceptible to overwinter energy drain. Therefore the energetic impacts of the timing of entry into winter dormancy will strongly influence ectotherm fitness in northern temperate environments. We conclude that thermal variability drives the expression of metabolic suppression in this species; that phenological shifts will have a greater impact on ectotherms in variable thermal environments; and that E. propertius will be more sensitive to shifts in phenology in autumn than in spring. This suggests that increases in overwinter thermal variability and/or extended, warm autumns, will negatively impact all non-feeding dormant ectotherms which lack the ability to suppress their overwinter metabolic thermal sensitivity.","[Williams, Caroline M.; Marshall, Katie E.; MacMillan, Heath A.; Sinclair, Brent J.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON, Canada; [Dzurisin, Jason D.

The biases are important because they are systematic and hence have cumulative effects. Several types of biases are discussed in this paper. Namely, numerical models that employ convex autoconversion formulas underpredict (or, more precisely, never overpredict) autoconversion rates, and numerical models that use convex functions to diagnose specific liquid water content and temperature underpredict these latter quantities. One may call these biases the grid box average autoconversion bias,'' grid box average liquid water content bias, '' and grid box average temperature bias, '' respectively, because the biases arise when grid box average values are substituted into formulas valid at a point, not over an extended volume. The existence of these biases can be derived from Jensen's inequality. To assess the magnitude of the biases, the authors analyze observations of boundary layer clouds. Often the biases are small, but the observations demonstrate that the biases can be large in important cases. In addition, the authors prove that the average liquid water content and temperature of an isolated, partly cloudy, constant-pressure volume of air cannot increase, even temporarily. The proof assumes that liquid water content can be written as a convex function of conserved variables with equal diffusivities. The temperature decrease is due to evaporative cooling as cloudy and clear air mix. More generally, the authors prove that if an isolated volume of fluid contains conserved scalars with equal diffusivities, then the average of any convex, twice-differentiable function of the conserved scalars cannot increase.","Colorado State Univ, Cooperat Inst Res Atmosphere, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; Meteorol Res Flight, Farnborough, Hants, England; Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Colorado State University; Met Office - UK; Colorado State University","Larson, VE (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Math Sci, POB 413, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.","vlarson@uwm.edu","Golaz, Jean-Christophe/D-5007-2014; Field, Paul/B-1692-2009; Vonder Haar, Thomas/F-2048-2011; Wood, Robert/A-2989-2008; vonderhaar, thomas H/N-6724-2015","Golaz, Jean-Christophe/0000-0003-1616-5435; Field, Paul/0000-0001-8528-0088; Wood, Robert/0000-0002-1401-3828; vonderhaar, thomas H/0000-0002-1962-7757","","","",NA,"35","69","70","0","6","AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC","BOSTON","45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA","0022-4928","","","J ATMOS SCI","J.

Zebrafish in the wild live in fluctuating thermal environments that potentially reach harmful temperatures. In the laboratory, zebrafish have gone through four decades of domestication and adaptation to stable optimal temperatures with few thermal extremes. If maintaining thermal tolerance is costly or if genetic traits promoting laboratory fitness at optimal temperature differ from genetic traits for high thermal tolerance, the thermal tolerance of laboratory zebrafish could be hypothesized to be lower than that of wild zebrafish. Furthermore, very little is known about the thermal environment of wild zebrafish and how close to their thermal limits they live. Here, we compared the acute upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima; CTmax) of wild zebrafish measured on-site in West Bengal, India, to zebrafish at three laboratory acclimation/domestication levels: wild-caught, F-1 generation wild-caught and domesticated laboratory AB-WT line. We found that in the wild, CTmax increased with increasing site temperature. Yet at the warmest site, zebrafish lived very close to their thermal limit, suggesting that they may currently encounter lethal temperatures. In the laboratory, acclimation temperature appeared to have a stronger effect on CTmax than it did in the wild. The fish in the wild also had a 0.85-1.01 degrees C lower CTmax compared to all laboratory populations. This difference between laboratory-held and wild populations shows that environmental conditions can affect zebrafish's thermal tolerance. However, there was no difference in CTmax between the laboratory-held populations regardless of the domestication duration. This suggests that thermal tolerance is maintained during domestication and highlights that experiments using domesticated laboratory-reared model species can be appropriate for addressing certain questions on thermal tolerance and global warming impacts.","[Morgan, Rachael; Sundin, Josefin; Finnoen, Mette H.; Dresler, Gunnar; Vendrell, MarcMartinez; Jutfelt, Fredrik] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Sundin, Josefin] Uppsala Univ, Dept Neurosci, S-75239 Uppsala, Sweden; [Vendrell, MarcMartinez] Univ Barcelona, Dept Biol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Dey, Arpita] Univ North Bengal, Dept Zool, Siliguri 734013, W Bengal, India; [Sarkar, Kripan] Rainbow Ornamental Fish Farm, Jalpaiguri 735101, W Bengal, India","Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Uppsala University; University of Barcelona; University of North Bengal","Morgan, R (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.","rachael.morgan@ntnu.no","Vendrell, Marius/AAF-6528-2020; Morgan, Rachael/AAA-1165-2020; Jutfelt, Fredrik/B-6988-2014","Morgan, Rachael/0000-0001-9589-6388; Jutfelt, Fredrik/0000-0001-9838-3991; Sundin, Josefin/0000-0003-1853-4046","Research Council of Norway [262942]; Swedish Research Council Formas [2013-947]","Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas)","This work was funded by the Research Council of Norway (262942 to F.J.) and by the Swedish Research Council Formas (2013-947 to J.S.).",NA,"53","25","25","2","23","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2051-1434","","","CONSERV PHYSIOL","Conserv.

Much of this work has focused on temperature because it is the best kept of climatic records, in many locations it is predicted to keep rising into the future, and it has profound effects on the physiology, performance, and ecology of organisms, especially ectothermic organisms which make up the vast majority of life on Earth. Nevertheless, much of the existing literature on temperature-organism interactions relies on mean temperatures. In reality, most organisms do not directly experience mean temperatures; rather, they experience variation in temperature over many time scales, from seconds to years. We propose to shift the focus more directly on patterns of temperature variation, rather than on means per se, and present a framework both for analyzing temporal patterns of temperature variation and for incorporating those patterns into predictions about organismal biology. In particular, we advocate using the Fourier transform to decompose temperature time series into their component sinusoids, thus allowing transformations between the time and frequency domains. This approach provides (1) standardized ways of visualizing the contributions that different frequencies make to total temporal variation; (2) the ability to assess how patterns of temperature variation have changed over the past half century and may change into the future; and (3) clear approaches to manipulating temporal time series to ask what if questions about the potential effects of future climates. We first summarize global patterns of change in temperature variation over the past 40 years; we find meaningful changes in variation at the half day to yearly times scales. We then demonstrate the utility of the Fourier framework by exploring how power added to different frequencies alters the overall incidence of long-term waves of high and low temperatures, and find that power added to the lowest frequencies greatly increases the probability of long-term heat and cold waves. Finally, we review what is known about the time scales over which organismal thermal performance curves change in response to variation in the thermal environment. We conclude that integrating information characterizing both the frequency spectra of temperature time series and the time scales of resulting physiological change offers a powerful new avenue for relating climate, and climate change, to the future performance of ectothermic organisms.","[Dillon, Michael E.] Univ Wyoming, Dept Zool & Physiol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Dillon, Michael E.] Univ Wyoming, Program Ecol, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Woods, H.

Despite recent interest in the effects of variance in single biological drivers, such as temperature, we have lacked a comprehensive framework for predicting how the variances and covariances between multiple environmental factors will affect physiological rates. Here, we integrate current theory on variance effects with co-limitation theory into a single unified conceptual framework that has general applicability. We show how the framework can be applied (1) to generate mathematically tractable predictions of the physiological effects of multiple fluctuating co-limiting factors, (2) to understand how each co-limiting factor contributes to these effects, and (3) to detect mechanisms such as acclimation or physiological stress when they are at play. We show that the statistical covariance of co-limiting factors, which has not been considered before, can be a strong driver of physiological performance in various ecological contexts.

However, current research casts doubt on the actual mitigating role of thermal acclimation to face heat impacts, due to its low magnitude and weak environmental signal. Here, we examined these drawbacks by first estimating maximum extent of thermal acclimation by examining known sources of variation affecting CTmax expression, such as daily thermal fluctuation and heating rates. Second, we examined whether the magnitude and pattern of CTmax plasticity is dependent of the thermal environment by comparing the acclimation responses of six species of tropical amphibian tadpoles inhabiting thermally contrasting open and shade habitats and, finally, estimating their warming tolerances (WT = CTmax - maximum temperatures) as estimator of heating risk. We found that plastic CTmax responses are improved in tadpoles exposed to fluctuating daily regimens. Slow heating rates implying longer duration assays determined a contrasting pattern in CTmax plastic expression, depending on species environment. Shade habitat species suffer a decline in CTmax whereas open habitat tadpoles greatly increase it, suggesting an adaptive differential ability of hot exposed species to quick hardening adjustments. Open habitat tadpoles although overall acclimate more than shade habitat species, cannot capitalize this beneficial increase in CTmax, because the maximum ambient temperatures are very close to their critical limits, and this increase may not be large enough to reduce acute heat stress under the ongoing global warming.","[Turriago, Jorge L.; Bernal, Manuel H.] Univ Tolima, Dept Biol, Grp Herpetol Ecofisiol & Etol, Tolima, Colombia; [Turriago, Jorge L.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Programa Doctorado Ciencias Biol, Bogota, Colombia; [Tejedo, Miguel] CSIC, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Estn Biol Doriana, Seville, Spain; [Hoyos, Julio M.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Dept Biol, Grp UNESIS, Bogota, Colombia","Universidad del Tolima; Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Pontificia Universidad Javeriana","Turriago, JL (corresponding author), Univ Tolima, Dept Biol, Grp Herpetol Ecofisiol & Etol, Tolima, Colombia.","jlturriagog@ut.edu.co","","HOYOS, JULIO MARIO/0000-0003-1232-9324","MINECO, Spain [CGL2017-86924-P]; Project Formacion de Talento Humano de Alto Nivel; Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion, Colombia [110574558312]; Direccion de Fomento a la Investigacion-Creacion e Innovacion, Universidad del Tolima, Colombia [130130516]","MINECO, Spain(Spanish Government); Project Formacion de Talento Humano de Alto Nivel; Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion, Colombia; Direccion de Fomento a la Investigacion-Creacion e Innovacion, Universidad del Tolima, Colombia","MINECO, Spain, Grant/Award Number: CGL2017-86924-P; Project Formacion de Talento Humano de Alto Nivel, approved by Fondo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (CTeI) del Sistema General de Regalias (SGR) BPIN 013000100103 Gobernacion del Tolima and Universidad del Tolima, Colombia; Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion, Colombia, Grant/Award Number: 110574558312; Direccion de Fomento a la Investigacion-Creacion e Innovacion, Universidad del Tolima, Colombia, Grant/Award Number: 130130516",NA,"100","0","0","7","7","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2471-5638","2471-5646","","J EXP ZOOL PART A","J.

In addition, the infraspecific populations of crustaceans might also have different response strategies to the rising of temperature. Therefore, we identified the transcriptomic variations to the same thermal stress between ecologically divergent populations of Oratosquilla oratoria. The aim of this study was to investigate the population-specific function genes and relevant pathways in response to thermal stress in O. oratoria. The results showed that gene-expressed variation was in a population-specific pattern, which indicated that the local environment could lead to the evolvement of changes in gene regulation, ultimately leading to adaptive divergences. Additionally, we found several genes with large pleiotropic effects in the Zhoushan population, which might indicate that the regulation mechanisms of the Zhoushan population were more efficient than those of the Qingdao population under same thermal stress. The results provided some novel insights into the local adaptive differences of the infraspecific populations of O. oratoria and other crustaceans. Crustaceans are generally considered more sensitive to ocean warming due to their lack of certain efficient regulators. However, the alterations in the physiology and behavior of crustaceans in response to thermal stress differ vastly even among the infraspecific populations of heterogeneous landscapes. Consequently, understanding the impact of temperature fluctuation on crustacean infraspecific populations might be essential for maintaining a sustainable persistence of populations at existing locations. In the present study, we chose the Japanese mantis shrimp (Oratosquilla oratoria) as the representative crustacean population, and conducted transcriptome analyses in two divergent O. oratoria populations (the Zhoushan and Qingdao populations) under same thermal stress (20-28 degrees C) to identify the population-specific expression response to thermal stress. The results showed significant differences in gene expressions, GO terms and metabolic pathways between the two populations. We hypothesized that intraspecific mutations in the same or different genes might lead to thermal adaptive divergences. Temperature increases from 20-28 degrees C produced significant enrichment in GO terms and altered the metabolic pathways in the Zhoushan population despite the lack of differentially expressed unigenes. Therefore, several functional genes with large pleiotropic effects may underlie the response to thermal stress in the Zhoushan population. Furthermore, the most significantly enriched biological processes of the Qingdao population were associated with the state or activity of cells and its significant enriched pathways with genetic information processing as well as immune and environmental information processing. In contrast, the differentially regulated unigenes of the Zhoushan population were primarily involved in the regulatory cellular and transcription processes and the most significant pathways found were metabolic and digestive. Consequently, the regulatory mechanisms of the Zhoushan population are probably more efficient than those of the Qingdao population under the same thermal stress.","[Lou, Fangrui; Han, Zhiqiang; Gao, Tianxiang] Zhejiang Ocean Univ, Fishery Coll, Zhoushan 316022, Peoples R China; [Lou, Fangrui] Ocean Univ China, Fishery Coll, Qingdao 266003, Shandong, Peoples R China","Zhejiang Ocean University; Ocean University of China","Han, ZQ; Gao, TX (corresponding author), Zhejiang Ocean Univ, Fishery Coll, Zhoushan 316022, Peoples R China.","d6339124@163.com; gaotianxiang0611@163.com","","Han, Zhiqiang/0000-0002-2898-2195","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0604902]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31472281]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0604902) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31472281).",NA,"62","5","5","5","20","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","2076-2615","","","ANIMALS-BASEL","Animals","JUL","2019","9","7","",NA,"",NA,"","","399","10.3390/ani9070399","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani9070399","","","19","Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture; Veterinary Sciences; Zoology","IN3YH","31262058","Green Published, Green Submitted, gold","","","2022-12-01","WOS:000478611800048","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Climate change, invasions and vector control strategies all alter the distribution and abundance of mosquitoes. When disease vectors undergo a range shift, so do disease burdens. Predicting such shifts is a priority to adequately prepare for disease control. Accurate predictions of distributional changes depend on how factors such as temperature and competition affect mosquito life-history traits, particularly body size and reproduction. Direct estimates of both body size and reproduction in mosquitoes are logistically challenging and time-consuming, so the field has long relied upon linear (isometric) conversions between wing length (a convenient proxy of size) and reproductive output. These linear transformations underlie most models projecting species' distributions and competitive interactions between native and invasive disease vectors. Using a series of meta-analyses, we show that the relationship between wing length and fecundity are nonlinear (hyperallometric) for most mosquito species. We show that whilst most models ignore reproductive hyperallometry (with respect to wing length), doing so introduces systematic biases into estimates of population growth. In particular, failing to account for reproductive hyperallometry overestimates the effects of temperature and underestimates the effects of competition. Assuming isometry also increases the potential to misestimate the efficacy of vector control strategies by underestimating the contribution of larger females in population replenishment. Finally, failing to account for reproductive hyperallometry and variation in body size can lead to qualitative errors via the counter-intuitive effects of Jensen's inequality. For example, if mean sizes decrease, but variance increases, then reproductive outputs may actually increase. We suggest that future disease vector models incorporate hyperallometric relationships to more accurately predict changes in mosquito distribution in response to global change.","[Norgaard, Louise S.; Alvarez-Noriega, Mariana; White, Craig R.; Marshall, Dustin J.] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Norgaard, Louise S.; Alvarez-Noriega, Mariana; White, Craig R.; Marshall, Dustin J.] Monash Univ, Ctr Geometr Biol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [McGraw, Elizabeth] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, Ctr Infect Dis Dynam, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [McGraw, Elizabeth] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [McGraw, Elizabeth] Penn State Univ, Entomol Dept, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Monash University; Monash University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Norgaard, LS (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Norgaard, LS (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Ctr Geometr Biol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.","lnorga10@hotmail.com","McGraw, Elizabeth/GRF-0434-2022; McGraw, Elizabeth/A-6658-2012","Norgaard, Louise/0000-0002-0938-0017; McGraw, Elizabeth/0000-0001-7973-088X; Alvarez-Noriega, Mariana/0000-0003-1295-6897; Marshall, Dustin/0000-0001-6651-6219; White, Craig/0000-0002-0200-2187","","","",NA,"85","1","1","3","9","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1354-1013","1365-2486","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL","Glob.

The results show that R-0, r and Tg present differential responses to thermal variation. Although temperature effects on R-0 and Tg are non-linear, r response was negligible. R-0 and Tg comprise a generational time scale, while r is at a chronological time scale.

The body size of conodonts, assessed as length of P1 elements, and their diversity show substantial changes in the mid-Carnian. The well-dated Long Chang, Yongyue and Caizitang sections in southwestern China record a change of palaeoenvironments from shallow-marine carbonate platforms to deeper, euxinic basins. All sections show a major loss of conodont diversity and abundance late in the Julian 1 at a time of rapid warming and marine anoxia. Conodont size saw a reduction in maximum, mean and minimum size during the Julian 2 to Tuvalian 2 interval caused by the short-lived appearance of small species and a size decrease of the survivors. Conodont mean size reduction coincided with marine euxinia or anoxia and temperature fluctuations during the Julian 2 to Tuvalian 2 interval. Carnian conodonts thus follow Bergmann's Rule: element size is inversely correlated to the temperature. Climate warming with the consequential development of marine anoxia or euxinia is probably directly responsible for biotic changes at this time.","[Zhang, Z.

The Aedes albopictus mosquito as the vector of dengue fever surged exponentially in the last decade, raising ecological and epistemological concerns of how climate change altered its growth rate and population dynamics. As the global warming pattern is considerably uneven across four seasons, with a confirmed stronger effect in winter, an emerging need arises as to exploring how the seasonal warming effects influence the annual development of Ae. albopictus. Methods: The model consolidates a 35-year climate dataset and designs fifteen warming patterns that increase the temperature of selected seasons. Based on a recently developed mechanistic population model of Ae. albopictus, the model simulates the thermal reaction of blood-fed adults by systematically increasing the temperature from 0.5 to 5 degrees C at an interval of 0.5 degrees C in each warming pattern. Results: The results show the warming effects are different across seasons. The warming effects in spring and winter facilitate the development of the species by shortening the diapause period. The warming effect in summer is primarily negative by inhibiting mosquito development. The warming effect in autumn is considerably mixed. However, these warming effects cannot carry over to the following year, possibly due to the fact that under the extreme weather in winter the mosquito fully ceases from development and survives in terms of diapause eggs. Conclusions: As the historical pattern of global warming manifests seasonal fluctuations, this study provides corroborating and previously ignored evidence of how such seasonality affects the mosquito development. Understanding this short-term temperature-driven mechanism as one chain of the transmission events is critical to refining the thermal reaction norms of the epidemic vector under global warming as well as developing effective mosquito prevention and control strategies.","[Jia, Pengfei; Tan, Xiaoyue] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiang; Chen, Jin] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiang] Arkansas Tech Univ, Dept Emergency Management, Russellville, AR 72801 USA; [Lu, Liang; Liu, Qiyong] China CDC, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Arkansas Tech University; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; National Institute for Communicable Disease Control & Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention","Chen, X (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Chen, X (corresponding author), Arkansas Tech Univ, Dept Emergency Management, Russellville, AR 72801 USA.","chenxiangpeter@gmail.com","Chen, Xiang/F-8556-2015; Chen, Jin/A-6417-2011","Chen, Xiang/0000-0002-5045-9253; Chen, Jin/0000-0002-6497-4141; TAN, Xiaoyue/0000-0001-9989-0573","National Key Basic Research and Development Plan of China Ministry of Science and Technology [2012CB955501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China of China Ministry of Science and Technology [81273139]","National Key Basic Research and Development Plan of China Ministry of Science and Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China of China Ministry of Science and Technology","The research was financially supported by National Key Basic Research and Development Plan (2012CB955501) of China Ministry of Science and Technology.

Yet the controls are shaped and interact at multiple spatiotemporal scales, from which macrosystem patterns in SOM emerge. Theory on SOM turnover recognizes the resulting spatial and temporal conditionality in the effect sizes of controls that play out across macrosystems, and couples them through evolutionary and community assembly processes. For example, climate history shapes plant functional traits, which in turn interact with contemporary climate to influence SOM dynamics. Selection and assembly also shape the functional traits of soil decomposer communities, but it is less clear how in turn these traits influence temporal macrosystem patterns in SOM turnover. Here, we review evidence that establishes the expectation that selection and assembly should generate decomposer communities across macrosystems that have distinct functional effects on SOM dynamics. Representation of this knowledge in soil biogeochemical models affects the magnitude and direction of projected SOM responses under global change. Yet there is high uncertainty and low confidence in these projections. To address these issues, we make the case that a coordinated set of empirical practices are required which necessitate (1) greater use of statistical approaches in biogeochemistry that are suited to causative inference; (2) long-term, macrosystem-scale, observational and experimental networks to reveal conditionality in effect sizes, and embedded correlation, in controls on SOM turnover; and (3) use of multiple measurement grains to capture local- and macroscale variation in controls and outcomes, to avoid obscuring causative understanding through data aggregation. When employed together, along with process-based models to synthesize knowledge and guide further empirical work, we believe these practices will rapidly advance understanding of microbial controls on SOM and improve carbon cycle projections that guide policies on climate adaptation and mitigation.","[Bradford, Mark A.; Wood, Stephen A.; Addicott, Ethan T.; Fenichel, Eli P.; Fields, Nicholas; Gonzalez-Rivero, Javier; Jevon, Fiona, V; Oldfield, Emily E.; Polussa, Alexander; Ward, Elisabeth B.] Yale Univ, Yale Sch Environm, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Wood, Stephen A.] Nature Conservancy, 1815 N Lynn St, Arlington, VA USA; [Maynard, Daniel S.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Univ Str 16, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Wieder, William R.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Wieder, William R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Yale University; Nature Conservancy; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; National Center Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - USA; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder","Bradford, MA (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Yale Sch Environm, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.","mark.bradford@yale.edu","Bradford, Mark A/G-3850-2012; Jevon, Fiona/ABB-9955-2020","Bradford, Mark A/0000-0002-2022-8331; Jevon, Fiona/0000-0002-3586-7566; WIEDER, WILLIAM/0000-0001-7116-1985; Maynard, Daniel/0000-0003-0142-9100","U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-1926482, DEB-1926413]; U.S. Department of Energy [BSS DE-SC0016364]","U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","MAB, AP, SAW, WRW, NF, JGR and FJ were supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation's Macrosystem Biology and NEON-Enabled Science program grants DEB-1926482 and DEB-1926413.

There are sound data about the responses of these partnerships to constant temperatures and sporadic thermal stress (mostly heat shock). However, the current understanding of the thermal ecology of insect-microbe holobionts remains patchy because the complex thermal fluctuations (at different spatial and temporal scales) experienced by these organisms in nature have often been overlooked experimentally. This may drastically constrain our ability to predict the fate of mutualistic interactions under climate change, which will alter both mean temperatures and thermal variability. Here, we tackle down these issues by focusing on the effects of temperature fluctuations on the evolutionary ecology of insect-microbe holobionts. We propose potentially worth-investigating research avenues to (i) evaluate the relevance of theoretical concepts used to predict the biological impacts of temperature fluctuations when applied to holobionts; (ii) acknowledge the plastic (behavioural thermoregulation, physiological acclimation) and genetic responses (evolution) expressed by holobionts in fluctuating thermal environments; and (iii) explore the potential impacts of previously unconsidered patterns of temperature fluctuations on the outcomes and the dynamic of these insect-microbe associations.","[Iltis, Corentin; Tougeron, Kevin; Hance, Thierry] Catholic Univ Louvain, Biodivers Res Ctr, Earth & Life Inst, Croix Sud 4-5, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Tougeron, Kevin] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, UMR CNRS 7058 EDYSAN Ecol & Dynam Syst Anthropise, 33 Rue St Leu, F-80039 Amiens, France; [Louapre, Philippe] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UMR CNRS 6282 Biogeosci, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Foray, Vincent] Univ Tours, UMR CNRS 7261, Inst Rech Sur Biol Insecte, Parc Grandmt, F-37200 Tours, France","Universite Catholique Louvain; Picardie Universites; Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bourgogne; Universite de Tours","Iltis, C (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Biodivers Res Ctr, Earth & Life Inst, Croix Sud 4-5, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.","corentin.iltis@gmail.com","","Iltis, Corentin/0000-0002-1379-8029; Foray, Vincent/0000-0002-1561-1934; Louapre, Philippe/0000-0003-1550-3797; Tougeron, Kevin/0000-0003-4897-3787; Hance, Thierry/0000-0001-5569-5020","FSR incoming Post-doctoral Fellowship of the UCLouvain; F.R.S.-FNRS","FSR incoming Post-doctoral Fellowship of the UCLouvain; F.R.S.-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS)","C.I. is a beneficiary of an FSR incoming Post-doctoral Fellowship of the UCLouvain.

Environmental monitoring systems using Wireless Sensor Networks are therefore of interest to obtain indicators of global warming. For the automatic classification of the sounds recorded on such systems, the proper representation of the sound spectrum is essential since it contains the information required for cataloguing anuran calls. The present paper focuses on this process of feature extraction by exploring three alternatives: the standardized MPEG-7, the Filter Bank Energy (FBE), and the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Moreover, various values for every option in the extraction of spectrum features have been considered. Throughout the paper, it is shown that representing the frame spectrum with pure FBE offers slightly worse results than using the MPEG-7 features. This performance can easily be increased, however, by rescaling the FBE in a double dimension: vertically, by taking the logarithm of the energies; and, horizontally, by applying mel scaling in the filter banks. On the other hand, representing the spectrum in the cepstral domain, as in MFCC, has shown additional marginal improvements in classification performance.","[Luque, Amalia; Gomez-Bellido, Jesus] Univ Seville, Escuela Politecn Super, Ingn Diseno, Seville 41004, Spain; [Carrasco, Alejandro] Univ Seville, Escuela Ingn Informat, Tecnol Elect, Seville 41004, Spain; [Barbancho, Julio] Univ Seville, Escuela Politecn Super, Tecnol Elect, Seville 41004, Spain","University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla","Luque, A (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Escuela Politecn Super, Ingn Diseno, Seville 41004, Spain.","amalialuque@us.es; jesgombel@outlook.es; acarrasco@us.es; jbarbancho@us.es","Barbancho, Julio/W-4950-2018; Carrasco Munoz, Alejandro/N-5367-2018","Barbancho, Julio/0000-0002-9132-6158; Luque, Amalia/0000-0002-1205-4722; Carrasco Munoz, Alejandro/0000-0001-9474-3929","Telefonica Chair Intelligence in Networks of the University of Seville","Telefonica Chair Intelligence in Networks of the University of Seville","This work has been supported by the Telefonica Chair Intelligence in Networks of the University of Seville.

In this paper, we add a model to the subject by considering a disordered system where the state space consists of various orderings of a list. As in spin glasses, the disorder of such permutation glasses arises from a parameter in the Hamiltonian being drawn from a distribution of possible values, thus allowing nominally incorrect orderings to have lower energies than correct orderings in the space of permutations. We analyze a Gaussian, uniform, and symmetric Bernoulli distribution of energy costs, and, by employing Jensen's inequality, derive a simple condition requiring the permutation glass to always transition to the correctly ordered state at a temperature lower than that of the nondisordered system, provided that this correctly ordered state is accessible. We in turn find that in order for the correctly ordered state to be accessible, the probability that an incorrectly ordered component is energetically favored must be less than the inverse of the number of components in the system. We show that all of these results are consistent with a replica symmetric ansatz of the system. We conclude by arguing that there is no distinct permutation glass phase for the simplest model considered here and by discussing how to extend the analysis to more complex Hamiltonians capable of novel phase behavior and replica symmetry breaking. Finally, we outline an apparent correspondence between the presented system and a discrete-energy-level fermion gas. In all, the investigation introduces a class of exactly soluble models into statistical mechanics and provides a fertile ground to investigate statistical models of disorder.","[Williams, Mobolaji] Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Harvard University","Williams, M (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Phys, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.","mwilliams@physics.harvard.edu","","Williams, Mobolaji/0000-0003-2188-5445","","","",NA,"13","0","0","0","0","AMER PHYSICAL SOC","COLLEGE PK","ONE PHYSICS ELLIPSE, COLLEGE PK, MD 20740-3844 USA","2470-0045","2470-0053","","PHYS REV E","Phys.

While ecologists have long accounted for such nonhomogeneous demography in deterministic population models, nonhomogeneous stochastic population models are largely absent from the literature. This is especially the case for models that use exact stochastic methods, such as Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), which commonly assumes that demographic rates do not respond to external environmental change (i.e., assumes homogeneous demography). In other words, ecologists are currently accounting for the effects of demographic stochasticity or environmental variability, but not both. In this paper, we describe an extension of Gillespie's SSA (SSA + ) that allows for nonhomogeneous demography and examine how its predictions differ from a method that is partly naive to environmental change (SSAn) for two fundamental ecological models (exponential and logistic growth). We find important differences in the predicted population sizes of SSA + versus SSAn simulations, particularly when demography responds to fluctuating and irregularly changing environments. Further, we outline a computationally inexpensive approach for estimating when and under what circumstances it can be important to fully account for nonhomogeneous demography for any class of model.","[Legault, Geoffrey; Melbourne, Brett A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Legault, Geoffrey] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Legault, G (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.","geoffrey.legault@colorado.edu","","Legault, Geoffrey/0000-0003-2136-587X; MELBOURNE, BRETT/0000-0002-8843-4131","National Science Foundation [1457660]; University of Colorado Boulder","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Colorado Boulder","In this study, preliminary simulation work used the Janus supercomputer, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (DEB, award number 1457660) and the University of Colorado Boulder.",NA,"83","4","4","0","15","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1874-1738","1874-1746","","THEOR ECOL-NETH","Theor.

The earliest failures are expected to be due to the presence of at least one polygranular cluster longer than some critical (Blech) length, while the next earliest are assumed to arise from linked shorter clusters. Using a simple model of the microstructure, the probability density function for the number of each of these types of failure-unit is determined as a function of the linewidth. For this simple model the overall failure distribution may be calculated essentially exactly using the Theory of Runs; consequently we can compare these exact results with some common approximations. It is demonstrated through Jensen's inequality that a common approximate method is in fact a rigorous upper bound for the failure distribution. The model exhibits the expected increase in median-time-to-failure and deviation-in-time-to-failure values with decreasing linewidth when forcing a lognormal distribution. Although this would suggest an eventual decrease in reliability with scale reduction, the exact results show that this is not the case.","Univ Loughborough, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England","Loughborough University","Dwyer, VM (corresponding author), Univ Loughborough, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.","v.m.dwyer@lboro.ac.uk","Dwyer, Vincent/GSI-4178-2022","","","","",NA,"30","1","1","0","1","IOP PUBLISHING LTD","BRISTOL","DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","0022-3727","","","J PHYS D APPL PHYS","J.

To describe this effect, we use a kinetic equation where the attraction force is taken into account in a way similar to how electromagnetic forces in plasma are treated in the Vlasov model. It is demonstrated that the instability occurs when the temperature T is lower than a certain threshold value T-s depending on the gas density. It is further shown that, even if T is only marginally lower than T-s, the instability generates clusters with density much higher than that of the gas. These results suggest that the instability should be interpreted as a gas-liquid phase transition, with T-s being the temperature of saturated vapor and the high-density clusters representing liquid droplets.","[Benilov, E.

Some basic insight into this complex problem can be gained by comparing the thermal physiology of interacting host and parasite species. In this study, we compared upper thermal tolerance among three component species in a natural host-parasitoid-hyperparasitoid system from Virginia, USA. To assess the ecological relevance of our results, we also examined a record of maximum daily air temperatures collected near the study site in the last 124 years. We found that the caterpillar host Manduca sexta had a critical thermal maximum (CTmax) about 4 C higher than the parasitic wasp, Cotesia congregata, and the hyperparasitic wasp, Conura sp., had a CTmax about 6 degrees C higher than its host, C. congregata. We also found significant differences in CTmax among instars and between parasitized and non-parasitized M. sexta. The highest maximum daily air temperature recorded near the study in the last 124 years was 42 C, which equals the average CTmax of one species (C. congregata) but is several degrees lower than the average CTmax of the other two species (M. sexta, Conura sp.) in this study. Our results combined with other studies suggest that significant differences in thermal performance within and among interacting host and parasite species are common in nature and that climate change may be largely disruptive to these systems with responses that are highly variable and complex.","[Agosta, Salvatore J.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Med Coll Virginia Campus, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Agosta, Salvatore J.; Joshi, Kanchan A.; Kester, Karen M.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA","Virginia Commonwealth University; Virginia Commonwealth University","Agosta, SJ (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Ctr Environm Studies, Med Coll Virginia Campus, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.;Agosta, SJ (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.","sagosta@vnu.edu","","Kester, Karen M/0000-0001-6052-7806","Presidential Research Quest Fund (PRQF) from Virginia Commonwealth University","Presidential Research Quest Fund (PRQF) from Virginia Commonwealth University","This work was supported by a Presidential Research Quest Fund (PRQF) from Virginia Commonwealth University awarded to SJA.

Our findings suggest that a universal approach to coping with the relationships between rapid climate changes and health may not be appropriate nor effective.","[Yang, Tse-Chuan] SUNY Albany, Dept Sociol, Ctr Social & Demog Anal, 315 AS,1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Jensen, Leif] Penn State Univ, Dept Agr Econ Sociol & Educ, Populat Res Inst, 110A Armsby, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Albany; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Yang, TC (corresponding author), SUNY Albany, Dept Sociol, Ctr Social & Demog Anal, 315 AS,1400 Washington Ave, Albany, NY 12222 USA.","tyang3@albany.edu","","Yang, Tse-Chuan/0000-0002-4271-4584","Center for Social and Demographic Analysis at the University at Albany, SUNY [R24-HD044943]; Population Research Institute at Penn State [R24-HD041025]; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; USDA [W-3001, PEN04504]; EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT [R24HD041025, R24HD044943, P2CHD041025] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Center for Social and Demographic Analysis at the University at Albany, SUNY; Population Research Institute at Penn State; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); USDA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD))","We acknowledge the support from the Center for Social and Demographic Analysis at the University at Albany, SUNY [R24-HD044943] and from the Population Research Institute at Penn State [R24-HD041025].

Given that higher temperatures increase the reproductive rate of temperate zone insects, insect population growth rates are predicted to increase in the temperate zone in response to climate. This consensus, however, rests on the assumption that food is freely available. However, under conditions of limited food, the reproductive output of the Texan cricket Gryllus texensis (Cade and Otte) was highest at its current normal average temperature and declined with increasing temperature. Moreover, low food availability decreased survival during a simulated heat wave. Therefore, the effects of climate change on this species, and possibly on many others, are likely to hinge on food availability. Extrapolation from our data suggests that G. texensis will show larger yearly auctuations in population size as climate change continues, and this will also have ecological repercussions. Only those temperate zone insects with a ready supply of food (e. g., agricultural pests) are likely to experience the predicted increase in population growth in response to climate change; food-limited species are likely to experience a population decline.","[Adamo, Shelley A.; Baker, Jillian L.; Lovett, Maggie M.

Models are becoming more complex and now commonly include physiological traits of the organisms of interest. However, endothermic species have received less attention than have ectotherms in these mechanistic models. Further, it is not clear whether responses of endotherms to climate change are modified by variation in thermoregulatory characteristics associated with phenotypic plasticity and/or adaptation to past selective pressures. Here, we review the empirical data on thermal adaptation and acclimatization in endotherms and discuss how those factors may be important in models of responses to climate change. We begin with a discussion of why thermoregulation and thermal sensitivity at high body temperatures should be co-adapted. Importantly, we show that there is, in fact, considerable variation in the ability of endotherms to tolerate high body temperatures and/or high environmental temperatures, but a better understanding of this variation will likely be critical for predicting responses to future climatic scenarios. Next, we discuss why variation in thermoregulatory characteristics should be considered when modeling the effects of climate change on heterothermic endotherms. Finally, we review some biophysical and biochemical factors that will limit adaptation and acclimation in endotherms. We consider both long-term, directional climate change and short-term (but increasingly common) anomalies in climate such as extreme heat waves and we suggest areas of important future research relating to both our basic understanding of endothermic thermoregulation and the responses of endotherms to climate change.","[Boyles, Justin G.; Smit, Ben; McKechnie, Andrew E.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Seebacher, Frank] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","National Research Foundation - South Africa; University of Pretoria; University of Sydney","Boyles, JG (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Zool & Entomol, Percy FitzPatrick Inst, DST NRF Ctr Excellence, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.","jgboyles@zoology.up.ac.za","Boyles, Justin G/A-5152-2010; Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014; Smit, Ben/D-9466-2011; Smit, Ben/AAO-4778-2020; McKechnie, Andrew E/E-4398-2010","Smit, Ben/0000-0003-4160-8242; McKechnie, Andrew E/0000-0002-1524-1021; Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311","University of Pretoria; Claude Leon Post-Doctoral Fellowship; DST/NRF Centre of Excellence at the Percy FitzPatrick Institute; Department of Zoology and Entomology; Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Pretoria","University of Pretoria; Claude Leon Post-Doctoral Fellowship; DST/NRF Centre of Excellence at the Percy FitzPatrick Institute(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Department of Zoology and Entomology; Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Pretoria","University of Pretoria Post-Doctoral Fellowship and a Claude Leon Post-Doctoral Fellowship (to J.G.B.); PhD. bursary from the DST/NRF Centre of Excellence at the Percy FitzPatrick Institute (to B.S.); Department of Zoology and Entomology and Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Pretoria funds (to J.G.B.).",NA,"120","141","141","5","158","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1540-7063","1557-7023","","INTEGR COMP BIOL","Integr.

Given that organisms respond physiologically to stressors, such as temperature, in highly non-linear ways, small modelling errors in predictor variables can potentially result in failures to predict mortality or severe stress, especially if an organism exists near its physiological limits. As a result, a central challenge facing ecologists, particularly those attempting to forecast future responses to environmental change, is how to develop metrics of forecast model skill (the ability of a model to predict defined events) that are biologically meaningful and reflective of underlying processes. We quantified the skill of four simple models of body temperature (a primary determinant of physiological stress) of an intertidal mussel, Mytilus californianus, using common metrics of model performance, such as root mean square error, as well as forecast verification skill scores developed by the meteorological community. We used a physiologically grounded framework to assess each model's ability to predict optimal, sub-optimal, sub-lethal and lethal physiological responses. Models diverged in their ability to predict different levels of physiological stress when evaluated using skill scores, even though common metrics, such as root mean square error, indicated similar accuracy overall. Results from this study emphasize the importance of grounding assessments of model skill in the context of an organism's physiology and, especially, of considering the implications of false-positive and false-negative errors when forecasting the ecological effects of environmental change.","[Kish, Nicole E.; Helmuth, Brian; Wethey, David S.] Univ South Carolina, Marine Sci Program, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Helmuth, Brian] Northeastern Univ, Marine Sci Ctr, Nahant, MA 01908 USA","University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Northeastern University","Kish, NE (corresponding author), Univ South Carolina, Sch Earth Ocean & Environm, 701 Sumter St,EWS 617, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.","kish.nicole.e@gmail.com","Wethey, David S/K-8063-2014; Helmuth, Brian/AAD-2664-2019","Wethey, David S/0000-0002-2549-1606; Helmuth, Brian/0000-0003-0180-3414","National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NNX11AP77G]","National Aeronautics and Space Administration(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA))","This work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NNX11AP77G to B.H. and D.S.W.).",NA,"99","11","11","0","2","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","2051-1434","","","CONSERV PHYSIOL","Conserv.

Currently, estimates of R-SG range from 68 to 98PgCyear(-1), causing considerable uncertainty in the global carbon budget. We argue the source of this variability lies in the upscaling assumptions regarding the model format, data timescales, and precipitation component. To quantify the variability and constrain R-SG, we developed R-SG models using Random Forest and exponential models, and used different timescales (daily, monthly, and annual) of soil respiration (R-S) and climate data to predict R-SG. From the resulting R-SG estimates (range=66.62-100.72Pg), we calculated variability associated with each assumption. Among model formats, using monthly R-S data rather than annual data decreased R-SG by 7.43-9.46Pg; however, R-SG calculated from daily R-S data was only 1.83Pg lower than the R-SG from monthly data. Using mean annual precipitation and temperature data instead of monthly data caused +4.84 and -4.36Pg C differences, respectively. If the timescale of R-S data is constant, R-SG estimated by the first-order exponential (93.2Pg) was greater than the Random Forest (78.76Pg) or second-order exponential (76.18Pg) estimates. These results highlight the importance of variation at subannual timescales for upscaling to R-SG. The results indicated R-SG is lower than in recent papers and the current benchmark for land models (98PgCyear(-1)), and thus may change the predicted rates of terrestrial carbon turnover and the carbon to climate feedback as global temperatures rise.","[Jian, Jinshi; Steele, Meredith K.; Hodges, Steven C.] Virginia Tech, Sch Plant & Environm Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Thomas, R.

This article presents an analysis of uncertainty in climate sensitivity that is robust to a range of assumptions. We show that increasing uncertainty is necessarily associated with greater expected damages from warming, provided the function relating warming to damages is convex. This constraint is unaffected by subjective or cultural risk-perception factors, it is unlikely to be overcome by the discount rate, and it is independent of the presumed magnitude of climate sensitivity. The analysis also extends to second-order uncertainty; that is, situations in which experts disagree. Greater disagreement among experts increases the likelihood that the risk of exceeding a global temperature threshold is greater. Likewise, increasing uncertainty requires increasingly greater protective measures against sea level rise. This constraint derives directly from the statistical properties of extreme values. We conclude that any appeal to uncertainty compels a stronger, rather than weaker, concern about unabated warming than in the absence of uncertainty.","[Lewandowsky, Stephan] Univ Western Australia, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Lewandowsky, Stephan] Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England; [Risbey, James S.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Smithson, Michael] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Newell, Ben R.] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Hunter, John] Antarctic Climate & Ecosyst Cooperat Res Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia","University of Western Australia; University of Bristol; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National University; University of New South Wales Sydney; Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre (ACE CRC)","Lewandowsky, S (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.","stephan.lewandowsky@uwa.edu.au","Risbey, James/M-8419-2013; Lewandowsky, Stephan/L-4272-2019","Risbey, James/0000-0003-3202-9142; Lewandowsky, Stephan/0000-0003-1655-2013; Smithson, Michael/0000-0003-4455-2192; Newell, Benjamin/0000-0003-1898-205X","Australian Research Council; Royal Society; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Climate Systems Science; National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Royal Society(Royal Society of London); Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Climate Systems Science(Australian Research Council); National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility; CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO))","Preparation of this paper was facilitated by a Discovery Grant and a Discovery Outstanding Researcher Award from the Australian Research Council, and a Wolfson Research Merit Award from the Royal Society, to the first author, by a Future Fellowship from the Australian Research Council to Ben Newell, and funding from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Climate Systems Science.

Phenotypic plasticity is a well-studied mechanism in this regard, yet the potentially complex effects of stochastic environmental variation on optimal mean trait values are often overlooked. Using an optimality model inspired by timing of reproduction in great tits, we show that temporal variation affects not only optimal reaction norm slope, but also elevation. With increased environmental variation and an asymmetric relationship between fitness and breeding date, optimal timing shifts away from the side of the fitness curve with the steepest decline. In a relatively constant environment, the timing of the birds is matched with the seasonal food peak, but they become adaptively mismatched in environments with temporal variation in temperature whenever the fitness curve is asymmetric. Various processes affecting the survival of offspring and parents influence this asymmetry, which collectively determine the 'safest' strategy, i.e. whether females should breed before, on, or after the food peak in a variable environment. As climate change might affect the (co) variance of environmental variables as well as their averages, risk aversion may influence how species should shift their seasonal timing in a warming world.","[Lof, Marjolein E.; Reed, Thomas E.; Visser, Marcel E.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands; [McNamara, John M.] Univ Bristol, Sch Math, Bristol BS8 1TW, Avon, England","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); University of Bristol","Reed, TE (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, POB 50, NL-6700 AB Wageningen, Netherlands.","t.reed@nioo.knaw.nl","Visser, Marcel E/A-9151-2009; Reed, Thomas E/A-5788-2012; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Visser, Marcel E/0000-0002-1456-1939; Reed, Thomas E/0000-0002-2993-0477; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X","NWO-VICI grant","NWO-VICI grant(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO))","M.E.V. is supported by a NWO-VICI grant.

We assessed the role of mitochondrial protection mechanisms (ATP-dependent and -independent mitochondrial proteases, and antioxidants) in tolerance to intermittent hypoxia or anoxia in three species of marine bivalves: hypoxia-tolerant hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica), and a hypoxia-sensitive subtidal scallop (Argopecten irradians). In clams and oysters, mitochondrial tolerance to hypoxia (18 h at 5% O-2), anoxia (18 h at 0.1% O-2) and subsequent reoxygenation was associated with the ability to maintain the steadystate activity of ATP-dependent and-independent mitochondrial proteases and an anticipatory upregulation of the total antioxidant capacity under the low oxygen conditions. No accumulation of endproducts of lipid or protein peroxidation was found during intermittent hypoxia oranoxiain clams and oysters (except foran increase in protein carbonyl concentration after hypoxia-reoxygenation in oysters). In contrast, hypoxia/anoxia and reoxygenation strongly suppressed activity of the ATP-dependent mitochondrial proteases in hypoxiasensitive scallops. This suppressionwas associated with accumulation of oxidatively damaged mitochondrial proteins (including carbonylated proteins and proteins conjugated with a lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde) despite high total antioxidant capacity levels in scallop mitochondria. These findings highlight a key role of mitochondrial proteases in protection against hypoxia-reoxygenation stress and adaptations to frequent oxygen fluctuations in intertidal mollusks.","[Ivanina, Anna V.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol Sci, Charlotte, NC 28269 USA; [Sokolova, Inna M.] Univ Rostock, Inst Biol Sci, Marine Biol, D-18055 Rostock, Germany","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of Rostock","Sokolova, IM (corresponding author), Univ Rostock, Inst Biol Sci, Marine Biol, D-18055 Rostock, Germany.","inna.sokolova@uni-rostock.de","Sokolova, Inna/AAE-4150-2019; Sokolova, Inna M./B-4955-2009","Sokolova, Inna/0000-0002-2068-4302; Sokolova, Inna M./0000-0002-2068-4302","CRDF Global awards [FSCX-15-61168-0, OISE-15-61170-0]","CRDF Global awards","This work was supported by CRDF Global awards FSCX-15-61168-0 and OISE-15-61170-0 to I.M.S",NA,"48","25","25","0","27","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

In several regions, they aggregate in higher densities to form black coral beds that support diverse animal communities and create biodiversity hotspots. These recently discovered ecosystems are currently threatened by fishing activities and illegal harvesting for commercial purposes. Despite this, studies dedicated to the physiology of antipatharians are scarce and their responses to global change stressors have remained hardly explored since recently. Here, we present the first study on the physiological responses of a mesophotic antipatharian Stichopathes sp. (70-90 m) to thermal stress through a 16-d laboratory exposure (from 26 to 30.5 degrees C). Oxygen consumption measurements allowed identifying the physiological tipping point of Stichopathes sp. (T-opt = 28.3 degrees C; 2.7 degrees C above mean ambient condition). Our results follow theoretical predictions as performances start to decrease beyond T-opt, with lowered oxygen consumption rates, impairment of the healing capacities, increased probability of tissue necrosis and stress responses activated as a function of temperature (i.e. increase in mucocyte density and total antioxidant capacity). Altogether, our work indicates that Stichopathes sp. lives at suboptimal performances during the coldest months of the year, but also that it is likely to have low acclimatization capacity and a narrow thermal breadth.","[Godefroid, Mathilde; Dubois, Philippe] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Biol Marine, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,CP160-15, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Hedouin, Laetitia; Merciere, Alexandre] PSL Res Univ, EPHE CNRS UPVD, USR 3278 CRIOBE, BP 1013, F-98729 Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Hedouin, Laetitia; Merciere, Alexandre] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Under the Pole Consortium] Under Pole, F-29900 Concarneau, France","Universite Libre de Bruxelles; UDICE-French Research Universities; PSL Research University Paris","Godefroid, M (corresponding author), Univ Libre Bruxelles, Lab Biol Marine, Ave FD Roosevelt 50,CP160-15, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.","mathilde.an.godefroid@ulb.be","","","King Leopold III Fund for Nature Exploration and Conservation [T0084.18]; King Leopold III Fund for Nature Exploration and Conservation; FNRS project COBICO [T0084.18]; ANR DEEPHOPE [168722]; Delegation a la Recherche DEEPCORAL; CNRS DEEPREEF; Agence Francaise pour la Biodiversite POLYAFB; IFRECOR","King Leopold III Fund for Nature Exploration and Conservation; King Leopold III Fund for Nature Exploration and Conservation; FNRS project COBICO; ANR DEEPHOPE(French National Research Agency (ANR)); Delegation a la Recherche DEEPCORAL; CNRS DEEPREEF; Agence Francaise pour la Biodiversite POLYAFB; IFRECOR","This work was supported by the King Leopold III Fund for Nature Exploration and Conservation, the FNRS project COBICO (Grant number T0084.18) , the ANR DEEPHOPE (ANRAAPG 2017 Grant number 168722) , the Delegation a la Recherche DEEPCORAL, the CNRS DEEPREEF, the Agence Francaise pour la Biodiversite POLYAFB and the IFRECOR.",NA,"148","0","0","2","6","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0048-9697","1879-1026","","SCI TOTAL ENVIRON","Sci.

When given a choice, animals usually seek to minimize the variance of gain. However, it is clear that the avoidance of variance in energetic gain depends on several factors, including hunger level. While holding the mean prey encountered constant, we studied the effect of variance in prey arrival on the growth rates of two pit-building antlion species, Myrmeleon hyalinus and Cueta lineosa. Both species construct pit-traps in loose soils and ambush small prey in the same desert habitats, while differing in their preferred microhabitat: shaded vs. exposed to direct sunlight. We expected the light-preferring species to better tolerate variance in feeding than the shade-preferring species, owing to the former's higher stress tolerance and natural occurrence in microhabitats that are more likely poor with prey. While increasing variance in prey arrival reduced the growth rates of both species, this decrease was more pronounced in the species inhabiting the shaded and most likely prey-richer microhabitat. The greater variance tolerance of the light-preferring species stems from its ability to capture several prey items when almost simultaneously encountered. It could also be that this species has lower basal metabolic rate, which improves its starvation tolerance. These two antlion species differed in their prey capture success, starvation and thermal tolerance, and we thus suggest that their tolerance to variance in feeding opportunities and functional response offer an additional axis that enables them to coexist in the same desert habitats.","[Barkae, E.

In this review, we first explore marine environmental variation from the perspective of pelagic organisms, the most abundant life forms in the ocean. Generation time, the ability to move relative to the surrounding water (even slowly), and the presence of environmental gradients at all spatial scales play dominant roles in determining the variation experienced by individuals, but this variation remains difficult to quantify. We then use this insight to critically examine current understanding of the environmental physiology of pelagic marine organisms. Physiologists have begun to grapple with the complexity presented by environmental variation, and promising frameworks exist for predicting and/or interpreting the consequences for physiological performance. However, new technology needs to be developed and much difficult empirical work remains, especially in quantifying response times to environmental variation and the interactions among multiple covarying factors. We call on the field of global-change biology to undertake these important challenges.","[Denny, Mark W.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Dowd, W.
