Although one boar had a good libido only a sperm free ejaculate could be collected on one day.

Understanding how animals that rely on these habitats respond to environmental change is crucial to inform when management actions should be implemented to mitigate or reduce impacts. Here passive acoustic telemetry was used to monitor the movements of spine-bellied sea snakes (Hydrophis curtus) within a coastal ecosystem to define activity patterns in relation to environmental conditions. Presence, movement and three-dimensional home range metrics calculated from monitoring data were tested against environmental (water temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, accumulated rainfall and tidal range) and biological (snout-vent length) factors on daily and monthly temporal scales to identify key environmental drivers of movement and the use of space. A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) framework using Akaike information criterion (AIC) indicated that tidal reach and atmospheric pressure strongly influenced the daily presence and movements of tagged individuals, respectively. Accumulated rainfall significantly influenced the volume of space used on a monthly timescale. This study presents first estimates of three-dimensional home ranges of sea snakes as well as novel information on how environmental variables influence daily and monthly presence, movements and use of space of coastal sea snakes. These data are important in further understanding the ecology of sea snakes and can inform future management actions for this poorly studied taxon in the light of increased environmental and anthropogenic disturbances.

J,"Crozier, L",,,,"Crozier, L",,,Winter warming facilitates range expansion: cold tolerance of the butterfly Atalopedes campestris,OECOLOGIA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Our ability to predict ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change requires an understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and range limits. The warming trend over the past half-century has generated numerous opportunities to develop much-needed case studies of these links. Species that are only limited by climatic factors are likely to shift range quickly during periods of warming. Such species directly impact recipient communities and indicate trends that will become more widespread. Because minimum temperature (T-min) is rising at twice the rate of maximum temperature, species with this range-limiting factor may be especially responsive to global warming. In this study, I test the hypothesis that rising T-min has directly affected the range of a skipper butterfly. Atalopedes campestris has moved northward rapidly this century, recently colonizing eastern Washington where January T-min has risen 3degreesC in 50 years. The results show that: 1. A. campestris' range lies completely within the -4degreesC January average minimum isotherm, and that recently colonized areas were below this threshold earlier this century. 2. In acute cold stress experiments, -4 to -7degreesC proved to be a critical thermal limit: median supercooling point was -6.3degreesC, and minimum lethal temperature (LT50 with 12-h exposure) was -5.7degreesC. 3. In chronic cold stress experiments, survivorship declined sharply in diurnally fluctuating thermal regimes typical of the current range edge. High mortality occurred under constant 0degreesC conditions as well as in fluctuating regimes, implying that thermal insulation from snow would not protect A. campestris. 4. There was no evidence of evolution in cold tolerance at the range margin, despite strong selection. Thus, winter warming was apparently a prerequisite for the range expansion. Characteristics of this species that seem to be associated with its rapid response are that it is an opportunistic species, it is not habitat or dispersal limited, and it is constrained by T-min.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,MAY,2003,135,4,,,,,648,656,,10.1007/s00442-003-1219-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-003-1219-2,,,,,,,,12684862,,,,,WOS:000183722700020,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is therefore necessary to quantify and assess properly the summer thermal performance and to determine how a green roof cover can attenuate and delay the temperature and heat flux acting on its surface. The paper deals with an experimental investigation of the dynamic thermal characteristics of a vegetated roof situated on a university building roof in south Italy. An analysis of the daily values of dynamic parameters showed a quite stable trend of the decrement factor with variation in the range 0.0982-0.1920. The time lag exhibited a trend ranging from 7.2 h to 8.5 h. A successive analysis was developed decomposing the trends of temperature into Fourier series to assess the response of the vegetated systems to solicitations of different frequencies and to assess the deviations, in the calculation of the dynamic parameters, arising from considering a sinusoidal variation with a 24 h period of the external forcing, in accordance with the International Standard EN ISO 13786, compared to the experimental values. The green roofs showed a behaviour similar to a high-pass frequency system, and relative errors, by using only the fundamental harmonic under 10% were found for 72.9% of the cases for the decrement factor and for 93.8% of the data for the time lag. Results demonstrated that when climatic conditions of the location are more irregular then the predictions of the dynamic parameters considering only the fundament harmonic instead of the real trend of the forcing can provide more relevant errors.",,,,,"Mazzeo, Domenico/O-1741-2014; Bevilacqua, Piero/X-8577-2019; Arcuri, Natale/AFU-6821-2022","Mazzeo, Domenico/0000-0001-7253-2506; Bevilacqua, Piero/0000-0003-3631-686X; Arcuri, Natale/0000-0003-2322-6523",,,,,,,,,,,,,0360-1323,1873-684X,,,,MAR,2018,131,,,,,,264,276,,10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.11.033,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2017.11.033,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000425571200024,View Full Record in Web of Science

While previous experimental studies have documented the effects of ambient temperatures on cognitive function, few have observed HW effects on indoor temperatures following subjects' habitual conditions. The objective was to evaluate the differential impact of having air conditioning (AC) on cognitive function during a HW among residents of AC and non-AC buildings using a prospective observational cohort study. Methods We followed 44 students (mean age = 20.2 years; SD = 1.8 years) from a university in the Greater Boston area, Massachusetts in the United States living in AC (n = 24) and non-AC (n = 20) buildings before, during, and after a HW. Two cognition tests were self-administered daily for a period of 12 days (July 9 - July 20, 2016), the Stroop color-word test (STROOP) to assess selective attention/processing speed and a 2-digit, visual addition/subtraction test (ADD) to evaluate cognitive speed and working memory. The effect of the HW on cognitive function was evaluated using difference-in-differences (DiD) modelling. Findings Mean indoor temperatures in the non-AC group (mean = 26.3 degrees C; SD = 2.5 degrees C; range = 19.6 - 30.4 degrees C) were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in the AC group (mean = 21.4 degrees C; SD = 1.9 degrees C; range = 17.5 - 25.0 degrees C). DiD estimates show an increase in reaction time (STROOP = 13.4%, p < 0001; ADD = 13.3%, p < 0.001) and reduction in throughput (STROOP = -9.9%, p < 0.001; ADD = -6.3%, p = 0.08) during HWs among non-AC residents relative to AC residents at baseline. While ADD showed a linear relationship with indoor temperatures, STROOP was described by a U-shaped curve with linear effects below and above an optimum range (indoor temperature = 22 degrees C - 23 degrees C), with an increase in reaction time of 16 ms/degrees C and 24 ms/degrees C for STROOP and ADD, respectively. Cognitive tests occurred right after waking, so the study is limited in that it cannot assess whether the observed effects extended during the rest of the day. Although the range of students' ages also represents a limitation of the study, the consistent findings in this young, healthy population might indicate that greater portions of the population are susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. Conclusions Cognitive function deficits resulting from indoor thermal conditions during HWs extend beyond vulnerable populations. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating sustainable adaptation measures in buildings to preserve educational attainment, economic productivity, and safety in light of a changing climate.",,,,,,"Williams, Augusta/0000-0002-1496-8931",,,,,,,,,,,,,1549-1277,1549-1676,,,,JUL,2018,15,7,,,,,,,e1002605,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002605,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002605,,,,,,,,29990359,,,,,WOS:000440339700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Only the varieties with short growth durations can be used in direct-seeded, double-season rice under subtropical conditions in central China in which the thermal time is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the grain yield and associated plant traits of direct-seeded, double-season rice using varieties with short growth durations. Field experiments were conducted using five short-duration varieties in the early and late seasons of 2015 and 2016 in Wuxue County, Hubei Province, central China. The grain yield ranged from 6.40 to 9.88 t ha(-1) with a total growth duration of 89 to 105 d across varieties, seasons, and years. The wide difference in grain yield was attributed to the spikelets per panicle and biomass production. Overall, Zaoxian615 (ZX615) produced relatively high grain yield across seasons and years among the five varieties due to its tall plants, heavy panicles, and high crop growth rate. The high temperatures during the vegetative stage and low daily minimum temperatures during the ripening period were critical for the yield performance of the early-season rice, whereas the grain yield of the late-season rice was largely driven by the high daily solar radiation during the reproductive and ripening periods. Our results suggested that rice breeders should develop short-duration rice varieties with a high crop growth rate and biomass production through desirable plant traits of tall plants and heavy panicles to further improve the grain yield of direct-seeded, double-season rice in central China.",,,,,"Xu, Le/GWQ-3685-2022","Xu, Le/0000-0003-4664-3135",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-4290,1872-6852,,,,OCT 1,2018,227,,,,,,49,55,,10.1016/j.fcr.2018.08.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2018.08.002,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000444930000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Obvious fluctuations induced by precipitation are observed for the outputs of sonic anemometer-derived temperature and wind velocity components.

It is found that the sensitivity of sonic anemometer-derived temperature to precipitation is significant, compared with that of the wind velocity components. The spectra of wind velocity and cospectra of momentum flux resemble the standard universal shape with the slopes of the spectra and cospectra at the inertial subrange, following the -2/3 and -4/3 power law, respectively, even under the condition of heavy rain. Contaminated by precipitation, however, the spectra of temperature and cospectra of sensible heat flux do not exhibit a universal shape and have obvious frequency loss at the inertial subrange. From the physical structure and working principle of sonic anemometer, a possible explanation is proposed to describe this difference, which is found to be related to the variations of precipitation particles.

A.",,,Effects of environmental factors on Cucumis melo L. subsp agrestis var. agrestis (Naudin) Pangalo seed germination and seedling emergence,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cucumis melo L. subsp. agrestis var. agrestis (Naudin) Pangalo (wild melon) is an invasive plant in many parts of Asia and North America. The reproduction of this species is by seeds, thus laboratory experiments were conducted in order to determine the cardinal temperatures and the effects of fluctuating temperature, heat, flooding stress, pH, seed longevity, and depth of burial onwild melon seed germination and seedling emergence. Of the three models tested, the intersected lines model best estimated the cardinal temperatures. The base, optimum, and maximum temperatures for wild melon seed germination were estimated as 20, 35, and 45 degrees C, respectively. The highest germination rates of wild melon were obtained at 30/20 degrees C and 35/25 degrees C (day/night). Only long exposure periods (up to 10 days) at 90 degrees C or greater than 5 min at 120 degrees C were efficient at reducing the germination of wild melon seeds. Flooding had limited impact on reducing wild melon seed germination until the third month after the treatment. The seeds of this weed germinated across a wide range of pH values, but germination rates were higher under acidic (pH 5) rather than basic (pH 8 and 9) conditions. Seed germination of wild melon, declined to 50% by the 23rd month after burial in the soil at 15 cm depth. Emergence of wild melon seedlings was higher at shallower burial depths than at deeper ones. These results suggest that the successful invasion of wild melon in an area can be explained, in part, by its tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions. The combination of seed longevity, lack of seed dormancy and rapid seed germination under favourable climatic conditions may explain its rapid establishment as a weed in summer crops. Among the management strategies that can be used to limit the infestation of wild melon in the fields, burying seed deeply during soil preparation seems to be the most promising. (C) 2016 SAAB.

J,"Duiker, SW; Lal, R",,,,"Duiker, SW; Lal, R",,,Carbon budget study using CO2 flux measurements from a no till system in central Ohio,SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Enhancing carbon sequestration in soil is an important means to reduce net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO,) to the atmosphere. The soil organic carbon (SOC) pool is the net result of carbon (C) input in the form of crop residue and biomass, and output including CO2 flux and other losses. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the influence of known additions of crop residue in a no till system on CO2 flux measured with the static chamber alkali-absorption method, and (2) calculate the C budget from the CO2 flux and C added in crop residue. The experiment was started on a Crosby silt loam (Stagnic Luvisol) in 1989. Annually 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 Mg ha(-1) wheat straw (Triticum aestivum L,) was applied. Noon soil temperature and daily CO2 flux were determined in 1997. Residue application rate had a significant impact on soil temperature as measured at noon, especially early in the growing season. Noon soil temperature was up to 14 degrees C higher under unmulched compared with that of mulched treatments. Measured CO2 flux ranged from 0.4 to 4.2 g C m(-2) per day. Differences in CO2 flux between crop residue treatments were not significant on most sampling dates, probably due to the presence of undecomposed residue in the soil which did not contribute to the CO2 Aux, and to variability in sampling. Average daily soil temperature at 5 cm depth determined on a nearby weather station explained 60% of the variation in CO2 flux from bare plots. The C budget calculated from CO2 flux measurements indicated a net depletion of SOC in all treatments. However, measured SOC contents indicated an increase of SOC over time in some treatments. It is likely that the annual CO2, flux measured with the static chamber alkali-absorption method is overestimated due to omission of CO2 measurements when soil water content is high, and perhaps other, as yet unknown factors. A comparison of the static chamber technique and improved dynamic chamber techniques and micrometeorological methods is recommended. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, a stochastic rainfall model (RainSim) combined with a rainfall conditioned weather generator (CRU WG) have been successfully applied in a semi-arid mountain climate, for part of the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), for point stations at a daily time-step to explore climate change impacts. Validation of the simulated time-series against observations (1961-1990) demonstrated the models' skill in reproducing climatological means of core variables with monthly RMSE of <2.0 mm for precipitation and <= 0.4 degrees C for mean temperature and daily temperature range. This level of performance is impressive given complexity of climate processes operating in this mountainous context at the boundary between monsoonal and mid-latitude (westerly) weather systems. Of equal importance the model captures well the observed interannual variability as quantified by the first and last decile of 30-year climatic periods. Differences between a control (1961-1990) and future (2071-2100) regional climate model (RCM) time-slice experiment were then used to provide change factors which could be applied within the rainfall and weather models to produce perturbed 'future' weather time-series. These project year-round increases in precipitation (maximum seasonal mean change:+27%, annual mean change: +18%) with increased intensity in the wettest months (February, March, April) and year-round increases in mean temperature (annual mean +4.8 degrees C). Climatic constraints on the productivity of natural resource-dependent systems were also assessed using relevant indices from the European Climate Assessment (ECA) and indicate potential future risk to water resources and local agriculture. However, the uniformity of projected temperature increases is in stark contrast to recent seasonally asymmetrical trends in observations, so an alternative scenario of extrapolated trends was also explored. We conclude that interannual variability in climate will continue to have the dominant impact on water resources management whichever trajectory is followed. This demonstrates the need for sophisticated downscaling methods which can evaluate changes in variability and sequencing of events to explore climate change impacts in this region.

Changes in climate attributes such as temperature are often measured over larger spatial scales, whereas environmental conditions to which many small ectothermic arthropods are exposed are largely determined by small-scale local conditions. Exposed edges of plant patches often exhibit significant short-term (daily) variation to abiotic factors due to wind exposure and sun radiation. By contrast, within plant patches, abiotic conditions are generally much more stable and thus less variable. Over an eight-week period in the summer of 2020, including an actual heatwave, we measured small-scale (1 m(2)) temperature variation in patches of forbs in experimental mesocosms. We found that soil surface temperatures at the edge of the mesocosms were more variable than those within mesocosms. Drought treatment two years earlier, amplified this effect but only at the edges of the mesocosms. Within a plant patch both at the soil surface and within the canopy, the temperature was always lower than the ambient air temperature.

Depending on habitat and season, the peak intensity of different abiotic stressors can occur in or out of phase with one another. Thus, some organisms are exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously, whereas others experience them sequentially. Understanding these physicochemical dynamics is critical because how organisms respond to multiple stressors depends on the magnitude and relative timing of each stressor. Here, we first discuss broad patterns of covariation between stressors in marine systems at various temporal scales. Wethen describe how these dynamics will influence physiological responses to multi-stressor exposures. Finally, we summarize how multi-stressor effects are currently assessed. We find that multi-stressor experiments have rarely incorporated naturalistic physicochemical variation into their designs, and emphasize the importance of doing so to make ecologically relevant inferences about physiological responses to global change.",,,,,"Armstrong, Eric J/L-9220-2019","Armstrong, Eric J/0000-0003-1223-4907; Stillman, Jonathon/0000-0002-4783-3830",,,,,,,,,,,,,1941-1405,,978-0-8243-4508-2,,,,2016,8,,,,,,357,+,,10.1146/annurev-marine-122414-033953,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-marine-122414-033953,,,,,,,,26359817,,,,,WOS:000368369200016,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this context, a multivariate spatio-temporal process is represented through the well-known Wold decomposition. Such an approach allows for an easy implementation of the Kalman filter to estimate linear temporal processes exhibiting both short and long range dependencies, together with a spatial correlation structure.

Bio-logging technology was used to investigate the foraging behavior of female leatherback turtles at St Croix, US Virgin Islands. Leatherback gastrointestinal tract temperatures (T(GT)) were analyzed for sudden fluctuations indicative of ingestions, and laboratory ingestion simulations were used to characterize temperature fluctuations associated with ingestion of prey versus seawater. Dive patterns associated with prey ingestion were characterized and the proportion of prey ingestion during the day (05:00-18:59h) and night (19:00-04:59h) were compared.

We examined spatial and temporal variation in the enzymatic capacities for ATP generation (malate dehydrogenase [MDH] and citrate synthase [CS]) and for detoxification of reactive oxygen species (superoxide dismutase [ SOD] and catalase [CAT]) at four microsites within a single population of the California ribbed mussel Mytilus californianus (Conrad 1837) over a 5-day period. At both a wave-exposed, cooler location and a protected, warmer location, mussels lower in the intertidal zone had higher rates of CS, MDH, and SOD activity than individuals situated higher on the shore. Activities of CS, CAT, and SOD also tended to be lower at the protected than at the exposed location. We simultaneously monitored two environmental variables that might influence mussels' biochemical status. Body temperature was recorded in mussel mimics, and food availability was derived from in situ measurements of chlorophyll a concentration and wave heights, to estimate feeding periods at each microsite. Recent food availability dominates over thermal history (the amount of recent heating) in determining the biochemical capacities of these mussels over the time windows we examined (up to the past 64h in 8 h increments). Activities of CS, MDH, and CAT were positively correlated with recent food availability at nearly all time windows. In contrast, only infrequently was thermal history negatively correlated with activities of CS (past 8 h and 64h), CAT (past 16-24h), and SOD (past 48-64 h). Opportunistic field sampling in the subsequent summer also showed that enzymatic activities align better with recent food availability than with recent thermal history. A controlled laboratory study confirmed that elevation of body temperature has no impact on the enzymes measured. In both laboratory and field experiments, there were strong positive correlations between enzymes that perform a related function (e.g., r = 0.667 between MDH and CS) as well as between the potential for ATP generation and the capacity to combat oxidative stress (e.g., 0.593 < r<0.769 between CS and CAT). Activities of MDH, CS and SOD decreased with increasing body size (metabolic scaling effect). The finding that food availability supersedes body temperature in determining metabolic status highlights the importance of considering small-scale spatial and temporal variation in multiple environmental variables that might impinge upon physiological rates, particularly when conducting large-scale surveys.

On an average basis 90% of the applied amount reached the field. The accumulated evaporation from the microscope slides was largest during the first hours after application, and the losses in 24 h (from 0% for tribenuron-methyl, fluroxypyr-1-methylheptylester and phenmedipham to 80% for prosulfocarb) was similar to other studies of losses from plant surfaces. An indication of a diurnal difference in the evaporation was observed, probably caused by the differences in temperature or by global radiation. The evaporation did not generally correlate to the vapour pressure. The amounts collected at t = 0 on the passive dosimeters were for all field experiments in the same range as the reported amounts applied to the field, and the passive-dosimeters method was found to be a good and reliable method for collection of sprayed pesticides.

A pilot program using specifically designed 'through-ice' conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and acoustic Doppler current profiling (ADCP) systems was conducted to opportunistically measure water mass properties and ocean currents at major ice stations. Additional water mass properties across the survey region were collected from Ice-Argo floats deployed during the voyage north of the 3000 m isobath. The mean drift of the floats was along the slope to the west with the Antarctic Slope Current. Vertical profiles of the potential temperature reveal the deepest (similar to 350-400 m) winter mixed layer (WML) in the western sector of the survey northwest of the Dalton Iceberg Tongue polynya. The meridional structure of the Antarctic Slope Front, i.e. the monotonic shoaling of the WML across the upper continental slope, is found to be similar to the previous observations in summer. A strong bottom-intensified intrusion of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) as warm as 0 degrees C was detected beneath the fast ice south of the continental shelf break at 118 degrees E. An mCDW intrusion of similar strength was detected near this location in the austral summer of 1996. We hypothesise that there is a persistent supply of mCDW and associated ocean heat flux to this region of the continental shelf that is capable of migrating to the grounding lines of the nearby Totten Glacier and Moscow University Ice Shelf. There was no detection of locally formed dense shelf water capable of forming Antarctic Bottom Water at the shelf break locations sampled despite the number of minor polynyas across this region. Ocean current measurements, limited to a maximum period of 24 h and 50-100 m depth by the relative scarcity of backscatter, found increased mean vertical speeds at the offshore stations (6-17 cm s(-1)) relative to the shelf break (2.3-6.4 cm s(-1)). The diurnal variation in the ADCP range reflected the diel migration of zooplankton occurring beneath the sea ice in late winter, with greater range/abundance offshore. Concurrent time series of wind, ocean current and their influence on sea ice drift from global positioning system (GPS) compass measurements were examined but the length of data acquisitions limited the applicability of this analysis.

Difficulties encountered by selected models such as CERES-sorghum and STICS to simulate crop development may result from the representation of sorghum response to daylength during the photoperiod inductive phase. Four modeling approaches combining two temperature and photoperiod responses (linear, hyperbolic) and two calculation methods for development rates (cumulative, threshold) were evaluated to simulate time to particle initiation (PI) in highly photoperiod sensitive Guinea sorghum variety CSM388. In the cumulative method, development rates were computed as summations of daily photothermal ratios, whereas in the threshold method accumulated degree days were tested against thermal time requirement to PI modulated by current photoperiod. Each model was calibrated based on observations from a Sotuba, Mali (12degrees39'N) planting date experiment spanning a 2-month period in 1996. Observed tit ne from emergence to PI decreased from 54 to 22 days for a 20 min variation in daylength. Apparent higher performance by threshold methods was further tested against a 1994 independent dataset featuring three latitudes and a much wider range of sowing dates extending from February to September. Results validate the superiority of threshold over cumulative methods and confirm the better fit of a hyperbolic temperature and photoperiod response. A threshold-hyperbolic modeling approach is believed to be more consistent with crop physiology as it associates cumulative (temperature) processes and trigger (photoperiod) events that better reflect the concepts of quantitative plant growth and qualitative plant development.

To this aim we compared measurements of surface and building envelope temperatures as well as conductive heat fluxes reaching the external building envelope with those measured on a conventional bituminous roof under identical climatic conditions. The main effect of green roofs was to decrease daily fluctuations of external building envelope temperatures and as a consequence to reduce fluctuations of conductive heat fluxes reaching the building envelope. This effect is all the more important that the substrate is deep, in link with its heat capacity and thermal inertia. Yet, no significant effect of the green roofs on surface urban heat island has been observed on average despite a surface cooling during daytime. It is concluded that the green roofs can be suitable urban greening solutions since they do not have negative effect on surface urban heat island during winter, provide cooling during summer, and contribute to building insulation inducing therefore building energy savings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0360-1323,1873-684X,,,,NOV,2021,205,,,,,,,,108202,10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108202,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108202,,AUG 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000703166500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seed germination was not influenced by light exposure. However, germination decreased after 12 (0.76) and 16 (0.65) weeks in cold-wet storage. To reduce germination significantly, -0.4MPa of osmotic potential (induced by PEG-6000) or 120mmolL(-1) of salt (NaCl) concentration was required. Seeds of I.diffusa showed high viability (0.85) after 720days of dry storage.

Although changing nest location may prevent sex ratio skews, it may also affect thermally sensitive performance traits in offspring. I tested righting, sprinting, and swimming performance in hatchling painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), produced by female turtles from five populations across the species' geographic range, nesting in a common-garden environment. I found that speed of hatchling performance was faster in hatchlings whose mothers originated from warmer climates, and that nests with higher mean daily variation in incubation temperature produced faster hatchlings.

We measured body temperatures, microhabitat temperatures, and operative temperatures; while in the laboratory, we measured the selected body temperatures. Our results show a change in the thermal parameters of O. occidentalis that is related to environmental constraints of their thermal niche. Environmental thermal constraints are present in both seasons (dry and wet), showing variations in thermal parameters studied. Apparently imposed environmental restrictions, the toads in nature always show body temperatures below the set point. Acclimatization is an advantage for toads because it allows them to bring more frequent body temperatures to the set point. The selected body temperature has seasonal intraindividual variability. These variations can be due to thermo-sensitivity of toads and life histories of individuals that limits their allocation and acquisition of resources. Possibly the range of variation found in selected body temperature is a consequence of the thermal environmental variation along the year. These variations of thermal parameters are commonly found in deserts and thermal bodies of nocturnal ectotherms. The plasticity of selected body temperature allows O. occidentales to have longer periods of activity for foraging and reproduction, while maintaining reasonable high performance at different temperatures. The plasticity in seasonal variation of the thermal parameters has been poorly studied, and is greatly advantageous to desert species during changes in both seasonal and daily temperature, as these environments are known for their high environmental variability.

The instrumentation for measuring SEB components is however resource-intensive and highly susceptible to damage under field-experiment conditions. A simple, less equipment-intensive, cost-effective, and relatively accurate method is thus required to overcome these setbacks. The present study, therefore evaluates the performance of a rather simple half-order time derivative (HTD) method in estimating sensible heat flux at a tropical location in West Africa (Ile-Ife, Nigeria 7 degrees 33 ' N, 4 degrees 33 ' E). HTD estimates of sensible heat flux were made from near surface atmospheric parameters measured during Phase I of the Nigerian Micrometeorological Experiment. At the same site, direct turbulence flux measurements from an eddy covariance system comprising a 3-D ultrasonic anemometer (USA-1) and a krypton hygrometer (KH20) were used as standard benchmark values for the HTD performance evaluation. Within a diurnal air temperature range of 18-34 degrees C, estimated daytime sensible heat flux reached a peak of 318.7 W m(-2) and a lowest nighttime value of - 15.8 W m(-2), indicating surface cooling. Statistical tests performed; mean bias error (MBE <2 W m(-2)), root mean square error (RMSE <7.3 W m(-2)), mean absolute error (MAE< 2 W m(-2)), and percent mean relative error (PMRE <1%) indicated a good accuracy of the HTD method with an overall significant correlation (R-2 = 0.89) with benchmark values.

At the home range scale, frogs selected the partially harvested treatment in spring 2005 and avoided the CWD-retained treatment in fall 2006. Frogs spent 5 + 2 d (mean +/- SE) longer in forested treatments than in both clearcut treatments, but certain individuals were able to specialize on the clearcut treatments. At the weekly activity centre scale, the best-supported models indicated that frogs were more likely to occupy locations with more complex ground structure, especially coarse woody debris, warmer temperatures, moister substrates, and greater canopy cover than random. Resource use among frogs overlapped substantially at both the weekly activity centre and daily microhabitat scales. Frogs selected daily microhabitats with more complex ground structure, greater canopy cover, and moister substrates than random. Selection at coarser scales may be mechanistically linked to finer scale resource selection by the physiological processes of thermo- and hydro-regulation.

The magnitude of winter energy drain depends on the species-specific capacity to seasonally modify the minimal maintenance costs. We examined seasonal variation of minimum oxygen consumption between two newt species, Ichthyosaura alpestris and Lissotriton vulgaris. Oxygen consumption was measured in both species during their active season (daily temperature range = 12-22 degrees C) and wintering period (4 degrees C) at 4 degrees C and 8 degrees C. The seasonal reduction in metabolic rates differed between species and experimental temperatures. Wintering newts reduced their metabolic rates at 4 degrees C and 8 degrees C in I. alpestris, but only at 8 degrees C in L. vulgaris. Both species reduced the thermal sensitivity of oxygen consumption during wintering. Theoretical calculations of winter depletion of caloric reserves under various thermal conditions revealed that seasonal metabolic reduction is more effective in I. alpestris than in L. vulgaris, and its effectiveness will increase with the proportion of warmer days during wintering period. The variation in winter metabolic reduction between sympatric newt species potentially contributes to their distribution patterns and population dynamics under climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The highest feeding frequency required for maximal growth, including that of small fingerlings was twice (2 x) daily, and the optimal feeding rates varied with water temperature and size of fish. The optimal daily regimes were: small fingerlings (initial mean weight, 2.0 g) 7.5% 2 x at a mean temperature of 23.3 degrees C; fingerlings (14.9-27.7 g) 7.5% 2 x at 27.1 degrees C, 5.0% 2 x at 23.7 degrees C and 2.0% 1 x at 16.8 degrees C; and large silver perch (162.5-510.6 g) 0.5% 1 x daily or 1.0% on alternate days at 15.6 degrees C, 1.0% 1 x at 17.3 degrees C, 3.0% 2 x at 24.1 degrees C and 2.0% 2 x at 27.9 degrees C.

Reproductive pairs were kept in isolation for two months at one of six temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C), and survival and a number of life-history traits recorded. Tolerance to heat and cold was assessed in individuals that survived the acclimation period by measuring upper and lower thermal limits. Life-history and thermal tolerance traits showed different relationships with temperature: generally non-monotonic for life-history and monotonic for thermal limits. The thermal history of the strain used in the study seemed to be partly responsible for this pattern, affecting the thermal responses of most life-history traits, but not those of the upper and lower thermal limits. Survival correlated positively with tolerance to cold but not with heat tolerance. This result supports the idea that tolerance to heat is under stronger selection in O. labronica, resulting in a lower level of plasticity for this trait. Some life-history features positively co-varied with tolerance to heat (e.g. body size), whilst in other cases reproductive traits showed apparent trade-offs with thermal limits. In all cases correlations amongst traits were apparently driven by their relationship with temperature. Even if we found no evolutionary trade-offs among the thermal responses of life-history traits and thermal limits, the strategies evolved by organisms to cope with thermal variability result from the mutual interaction of these traits, which plays a key role in defining organisms' responses to temperature changes and fluctuations.

Growth phase, phase in the diurnal cycle and temperature influenced the 19'hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin to chlorophyll a ratio in both strains. Large differences in this ratio were found between flagellates and colony cells from the same strain. Despite variability within each strain, mean levels of 19'hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin were always higher in the Antarctic strain. Another fucoxanthin-related pigment, 19'butanoyloxyfucoxanthin, showed the same trends during growth as 19'hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin in the Antarctic strain but was undetectable in the strain isolated from the North Sea. A comparison was made with field data collected during the Phaeocystis blooming period in the coastal zone of the North Sea. During this period relative amounts of 19'hexanoyloxyfucoanthin as well as the absence of 19'butanoyloxyfucoxanthin matched with the results from the North Sea strain in culture. Environmental factors influence pigment content and ratio, yet the two investigated Phaeocystis strains can be distinguished on the basis of their pigment characteristics.",,,,,"Buma, Anita/E-8372-2015",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0077-7579,,,,,JUN,1991,27,2,,,,,173,182,,10.1016/0077-7579(91)90010-X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(91)90010-X,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991FY01100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effects of seven factors on the fluctuations of the total length at recapture on November I (Y) of 23 release groups of seeds released based on the data of mark-recapture experiments from 1991 to 1995 and from 2000 to 2002 were examined by multiple regression analysis. The factors were as follows: the date of release in July (X-1), total length at release (X-2), release site (X-3), CPUE (X-5) and average surface water temperature of the habitat in July and August (X-6) and in September and October (X-7). The relationship of total length to these factors was follows: Y= - 1.14X(1) + 0.49X(2) - 6.03X(3) + 0.54X(5) - 2.6OX(6) + 1.87X(7) + 211.69 The regression was significant at the 1% level.

Measurements of leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture and temperature, runoff, soil carbon (C), and soil respiration (R) were also compared with model output. An experimental approach was designed to help attribute model errors to the vegetation dynamics and phenology formulations versus simulated biological processes. Continental scale phenology sub-models poorly represented the timing of budburst and evolution of canopy LAI in deciduous forests. Biases of vegetation green-up of 6 weeks and delayed senescence were noted. Simulated soil temperatures were overestimated (underestimated) during the summer (winter) on average by 2-5 degrees C. Ecosystem R was overestimated during the growing season, on average, by 20-60 g C m(-2) month(-1), and underestimated during the winter by 10-20 g C m(-2) month(-1) at all sites. Simulated soil R failed to capture observed mid-summer peak rates and was generally lower than observed in winter. The overall comparison of simulated net ecosystem production (NEP) to observations showed a significant underestimate of growing season NEP of 25-100gCm(-2) month(-1), and an overall positive bias of 10-40 g C m(-2) month(-1) during the winter. Excellent agreement between annual average NEP observations and IBIS simulations in fixed vegetation mode resulted from offsetting seasonal model biases. The magnitude of simulated variation in seasonal and inter-annual C exchange was generally dampened with respect to observations. The parameterization, and in some cases the formulations (e.g., ecosystem R and phenology) limited model capacity to capture the seasonal fluctuations of C and water exchange. Model parameterizations and formulations were originally constrained and generalized for application to a wide range of global climate and soil conditions and plant functional types (PFTs), likely contributing to model biases. This problem potentially applies to other DGVMs and biosphere models, and will likely become increasingly relevant if investigators apply their models at higher spatial resolution. We suggest that revisions to DGVMs should focus on advancing the capabilities of current phenology formulations to account for photoperiod, soil moisture and frost in addition to temperature. Model representations of PFTs and formulations of ecosystem R need to be rethought, particularly with respect to use of Q(10) temperature functions as modifiers. Surface energy balance, C allocation, soil R, and plant response to nutrient stress deserve attention as well.",,,,,"Manchun, Kang/D-3194-2011; Baldocchi, Dennis/A-1625-2009","Baldocchi, Dennis/0000-0003-3496-4919; Kucharik, Christopher/0000-0002-0400-758X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,,,JUL 10,2006,196,1-2,,,,,1,31,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.11.031,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.11.031,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000238638900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A field experiment was carried out on a sandy loam soil from April 2007 to October 2012 to evaluate the processes of soil desiccation in the 500 cm soil profiles, and the effects of mulch management on soil water content and temperature in the upper soil layer (5-15 cm), water use efficiency (WUE) and forage dry matter yield (DMY) of alfalfa in rainfed pasture land. Three treatments were: no mulch control, gravel mulch and corn straw mulch. Corn straw and gravel were chosen, because these materials can be obtained easily in this region. Soil depth of water uptake by alfalfa moved down to deep soil quickly and seasonal rainfall became the main contributing factor after 5 years. The presence of straw on the soil surface reduced the maximum temperature, but it increased the minimum diurnal soil temperature. Straw mulch was more effective in regulating soil temperature than gravel in the pasture planting. Straw mulch and gravel mulch both enhanced soil water content at the 15 cm depth. Straw mulch increased forage DMY of alfalfa by 420 kg ha(-1) (by 6.7%) compared to no mulch control over the four growing seasons from 2009 to 2012, and gravel mulch reduced the forage DMY by 36 kg ha(-1) (by 0.5%) during that period, but effects were not significant statistically. Straw mulch increased concentration of nitrate-N and available P in the upper soil layer significantly, and improved WUE. In conclusion, the findings suggest that alfalfa could extract water from progressively deeper soil layers and straw mulch was effective in minimizing fluctuations in soil temperature, and increasing water storage in surface shallow soil layers, forage yield and water use efficiency of alfalfa.

This leads to the general hypothesis that landscapes with persistently low lemming population densities, or low amplitude population fluctuations, have a low proportion of the land base with deep snow. We experimentally tested a component of this hypothesis, that snow depth influences habitat choice, at three Canadian Arctic sites: Bylot Island, Nunavut; Herschel Island, Yukon; Komakuk Beach, Yukon. We used snow fencing to enhance snow depth on 9-ha tundra habitats, and measured the intensity of winter use of these and control areas by counting rodent winter nests in spring. At all three sites, the density of winter nests increased in treated areas compared to control areas after the treatment, and remained higher on treated areas during the treatment. The treatment was relaxed at one site, and winter nest density returned to pre-treatment levels. The rodents' proportional use of treated areas compared to adjacent control areas increased and remained higher during the treatment. At two of three sites, lemmings and voles showed significant attraction to the areas of deepest snow accumulation closest to the fences. The strength of the treatment effect appeared to depend on how quickly the ground level temperature regime became stable in autumn, coincident with snow depths near the hiemal threshold.

Biological communities are responding to global climate change through poleward shifts in distribution, and changes in abundance and phenology of both native and non-native species. An increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events is predicted with global climate change. Much is known about mortality events of marine organisms in relation to warm thermal stress with relatively little known about cold thermal stress, particularly in the tropics. Intertidal species are particularly susceptible to fluctuations in aerial conditions and many are considered indicators of climate change. Perna viridis is a recent invader to the United States where it fouls hard substrates and soft sediment habitats. During winter 2007/08, a mortality event was observed for P. viridis across Tampa Bay, Florida. This mortality event coincided with extreme weather conditions when air temperatures dropped below 2 degrees C for a period of 6 h during low water. The minimum air temperature recorded was 0.53 degrees C. During this period water temperature remained relatively constant (similar to 20 degrees C). We provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that thermal stress relating to exposure to cold air temperatures during emersion was the primary factor underpinning the mortality event. Similar mortality events occurred in 2009 and 2010, also coinciding with prolonged exposure to low air temperatures. In the short term, weather may be responsible for the temporary trimming back of populations at the edge of their geographic range but in the longer-term, it is expected that climate warming will trigger the poleward movement of both native and non-native species potentially facilitating biotic homogenisation of marine communities. The challenge now is to devise adaptive management strategies in order to mitigate any potential negative impacts to native biodiversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Exploring the land-surface energy balance and the water/heat transfer processes of such regions for water resource management purposes is critical. The processes of surface water and heat transfer throughout the desert ecosystems and the effects of environmental factors on the energy distribution remain poorly studied. In this study, we used an eddy covariance system and surface meteorological data (2019-2021) to investigate the characteristics of the energy balance of Dengkou Desert ecosystem located in Inner Mongolia, northern China. Also, we evaluated the effects of different environmental factors on the energy distribution in this desert ecosystem. We found that the temporal patterns of both sensible heat flux (H) and latent heat flux (LE) with time are consistent with that of net radiation (R-n), and R-n is dominated by H. The sum of the daily average soil heat flux during the observation period was positive, indicating that soil was a heat sink and that the atmosphere transfers heat to the soil. During the observation period, the energy distribution of H/R-n fluctuated greatly, presenting a general U-shaped trend, while LE/R-n presented an inverted V-shaped trend. The main factor affecting H was R-n, followed by saturated vapor pressure, air temperature (T-a), and relative humidity. For LE, the main influencing factors were T-a, and R-n. The energy closure of the half-hour flux in the Inner Mongolian desert ecosystem during the observation period was 48%-68%, and the energy balance ratio was 0.54-0.74.

Hotter summers could result in higher temperatures inside lizard nests, potentially exposing embryos to thermally stressful conditions during development. Potentially, developmentally plastic shifts in thermal tolerance could allow lizards to adapt to climate warming. To determine how higher nest temperatures affect the thermal tolerance of hatchling geckos, we incubated eggs of the rock-dwelling velvet gecko, Amalosia lesueurii, at two fluctuating temperature regimes to mimic current nest temperatures (mean 23.2 degrees C, range 10-33 degrees C, 'cold') and future nest temperatures (mean 27.0 degrees C, range 14-37 degrees C, 'hot'). Hatchlings from the hot incubation group hatched 27 days earlier and had a lower critical thermal maximum (CTmax 38.7 degrees C) and a higher critical thermal minimum (CTmin 6.2 degrees C) than hatchlings from cold incubation group (40.2 and 5.7 degrees C, respectively). In the field, hatchlings typically settle under rocks near communal nests. During the hatching period, rock temperatures ranged from 13 to 59 degrees C, and regularly exceeded the CTmax of both hot- and cold-incubated hatchlings. Because rock temperatures were so high, the heat tolerance of lizards had little effect on their ability to exploit rocks as retreat sites. Instead, the timing of hatching dictated whether lizards could exploit rocks as retreat sites; that is, cold-incubated lizards that hatched later encountered less thermally stressful environments than earlier hatching hot-incubated lizards. In conclusion, we found no evidence that CTmax can shift upwards in response to higher incubation temperatures, suggesting that hotter summers may increase the vulnerability of lizards to climate warming.",,,,,"Dayananda, Buddhi/AAN-2100-2020","Dayananda, Buddhi/0000-0002-7607-0596; Murray, Brad/0000-0002-4734-5976; Webb, Jonathan/0000-0003-4822-6829",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUN 15,2017,220,12,,,,,2159,2165,,10.1242/jeb.152272,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.152272,,,,,,,,28615488,,,,,WOS:000403337600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their habitat temperatures, metabolic rates, feeding and reproductive strategies all together suggest that the pace of life in these species is reduced when compared to neritic octopod species, but information on longevity, growth rates and age estimations are absent to date. To estimate the pace of life in pelagic octopods, this study investigated size at maturity, reproductive strategy, and the number of growth-increments in the upper beak lateral walls (LWS) of J. diaphana (an octopod) and V. infernalis (a vampyromorph). Daily deposition of growth increments in hard body structures (e.g., beaks and stylets) has been validated experimentally in some temperate and tropical octopods, but remains unquantified and not yet validated for most deep-sea and high-latitude cephalopods. We used a diverse assemblage of specimens ranging from early juveniles to adults for both species. Mature J. diaphana had a mantle length (ML) of 53-144 mm and a body mass (BM) of 18-235 g. A brooding female of J. diaphana captured at 1352 m in the Gulf of California was carrying 1419 eggs in pre-organogenetic stage that measured similar to 2.5 mm in diameter. The size range of mature V. infernalis was ML 66-122 mm and BM 34-286 g. The number of growth increments in the beaks ranged from 21 to 207 in J. diaphana and from 89 to 375 in V. infernalis. If the growth increments are formed daily, like in tropical octopod species, age estimates are incongruent with the low metabolic rates and reproductive strategies of the two species. These observations suggest that growth increments may require more than one day to be formed.

However, our results suggest that sheep adjust their behaviour during hot weather, which may be a strategy to conserve energy, manage higher water requirements and/or reduce thermal load. Although grazing range decreases with higher temperatures, overall utilisation of a paddock may not be severely affected unless cooler days were too infrequent to facilitate regular access to these areas.",,,,,"Wilmot, Matt/D-5362-2011; Thomas, Dean T/E-4096-2010","Thomas, Dean T/0000-0001-6653-2315",,,,,,,,,,,,,0816-1089,1836-5787,,,,,2008,48,6-7,,,,,889,892,,10.1071/EA08061,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA08061,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000256896200033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Enhancing landscapes with wildflowers is a primary strategy for conserving pollinators and may improve the sustainability of M. rotundata. Changing cold storage temperatures from a traditionally static thermal regime (STR) to a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) improves overwintering success and extends M. rotundata's shelf life and pollination window. Whether floral resources enhance overwintering survival and/or interact with a thermal regime are unknown. We tested the combined effects of enhancing alfalfa fields with wildflowers and thermal regime on survival and macronutrient stores under extended cold storage (i.e., beyond one season). Megachile rotundata adults were released in alfalfa plots with and without wildflower strips. Completed nests were harvested in September and stored in STR. After a year, cells were randomly assigned to remain in STR for 6 months or in FTR for a year of extended cold storage; emergence rates were observed monthly. Macronutrient levels of emerged females were assessed. FTR improved M. rotundata survival but there was no measurable effect of wildflower strips on overwintering success or nutrient stores. Timing of nest establishment emerged as a key factor: offspring produced late in the season had lower winter survival and dry body mass. Sugars and glycogen stores increased under FTR but not STR. Trehalose levels were similar across treatments. Total lipid stores depleted faster under FTR. While wildflowers did not improve M. rotundata survival, our findings provide mechanistic insight into benefits and potential costs of FTR for this important pollinator.",,,,,,"Bowsher, Julia/0000-0001-6347-9635",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,OCT 21,2022,51,5,,,,,958,968,,10.1093/ee/nvac062,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvac062,,AUG 2022,,,,,,35964238,,,,,WOS:000840327800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in equatorial regions, where day length is nearly constant, other factors such as rainfall and temperature are thought to determine timing of reproduction. Rainfall can vary at small spatial and temporal scales, providing a highly fluctuating and unpredictable environmental cue. In this study we investigated the extent to which spatio-temporal variation in environmental conditions can explain the timing of breeding of Red-capped Lark, Calandrella cinerea, a species that is capable of reproducing during every month of the year in our equatorial east African study locations. For 39 months in three climatically-distinct locations, we monitored nesting activities, sampled ground and flying invertebrates, and quantified rainfall, maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) temperatures. Among locations we found that lower rainfall and higher temperatures did not coincide with lower invertebrate biomasses and decreased nesting activities, as predicted. Within locations, we found that rainfall, Tmax, and Tmin varied unpredictably among months and years. The only consistent annually recurring observations in all locations were that January and February had low rainfall, high Tmax, and low Tmin. Ground and flying invertebrate biomasses varied unpredictably among months and years, but invertebrates were captured in all months in all locations. Red-capped Larks bred in all calendar months overall but not in every month in every year in every location. Using model selection, we found no clear support for any relationship between the environmental variables and breeding in any of the three locations. Contrary to popular understanding, this study suggests that rainfall and invertebrate biomass as proxy for food do not influence breeding in equatorial Larks. Instead, we propose that factors such as nest predation, female protein reserves, and competition are more important in environments where weather and food meet minimum requirements for breeding during most of the year.",,,,,"Matson, Kevin D./R-1986-2019; Muchai, Muchane/B-4076-2008; Matson, Kevin David/G-3855-2010","Muchai, Muchane/0000-0002-2387-4486; Matson, Kevin David/0000-0002-4373-5926",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,APR 18,2017,12,4,,,,,,,e0175275,10.1371/journal.pone.0175275,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175275,,,,,,,,28419105,,,,,WOS:000399875200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Annual variation in the location of seed rain and microclimates results in transient windows of opportunity for tree seedling establishment across the landscape. These establishment windows vary at fine spatiotemporal scales that are not considered in most assessments of climate change impacts on tree species range dynamics and habitat displacement. We integrate field seedling establishment trials conducted in the southern Sierra Nevada and western Tehachapi Mountains of southern California with spatially downscaled grids of modeled water-year climatic water deficit (CWDwy) and mean August maximum daily temperature (T-max) to map historical and projected future microclimates suitable for establishment windows of opportunity for Quercus douglasii, a dominant tree species of warm, dry foothill woodlands, and Q. kelloggii, a dominant of cooler, more mesic montane woodlands and forests. Based on quasi-binomial regression models, Q. douglasii seedling establishment is significantly associated with modeled CWDwy and to a lesser degree with modeled T-max. Q. kelloggii seedling establishment is most strongly associated with T-max and best predicted by a two-factor model including CWDwy and T-max. Establishment niche models are applied to explore recruitment window dynamics in the western Tehachapi Mountains, where these species are currently widespread canopy dominants. Establishment windows are projected to decrease by 50-95%, shrinking locally to higher elevations and north-facing slopes by the end of this century depending on the species and climate scenario. These decreases in establishment windows suggest the potential for longer-term regional population declines of the species. While many additional processes regulate seedling establishment and growth, this study highlights the need to account for topoclimatic controls and interannual climatic variation when assessing how seedling establishment and colonization processes could be affected by climate change.",,,,,"Davis, Frank W./B-7010-2009; Sweet, Lynn/P-4924-2019; Franklin, Janet/G-6538-2013; Serra-Diaz, Josep M/C-3614-2015","Davis, Frank W./0000-0002-4643-5718; Sweet, Lynn/0000-0003-0886-4973; Franklin, Janet/0000-0003-0314-4598; Syphard, Alexandra/0000-0003-3070-0596; Serra-Diaz, Josep M/0000-0003-1988-1154",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,NOV,2016,7,11,,,,,,,e01573,10.1002/ecs2.1573,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1573,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000392207600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hence, thermal performance evaluation is necessary to optimize green roof design and its cooling effect. In this paper, we evaluated the outdoor spatio-temporal performance of a full-scale extensive green roof (EGR) inNanjing, China throughout a summer at three heights (30, 60and 120cm). We found the EGR exhibited an overall slight diurnal cooling effect at all three heights (-0.09, -0.23, and - 0.09 degrees C, respectively), but there was an obvious warming effect at a couple of specific hours during daytime. Especially on sunny days, the maximum warming effect at all three heights was 1.59, 0.59, and 0.38 degrees C, respectively. During the night, the EGR had a pronounced cooling effect of -0.63, -0.40, and - 0.15 degrees C, respectively. Among the weather scenarios, sunny days had the highest impact on the EGR's thermal performance, while effects were less pronounced on cloudy and rainy days. The average range of hourly air temperature difference at 30 cm between EGR and a bare roof on selected days was 4.02 (sunny), 2.67 (cloudy), and 0.74 degrees C (rainy). The results ofmultiple-regression analyses showed strong and significant correlations of air temperature difference between the EGR and a bare roof with differences in relative humidity, net radiation, several measures of soil and surface temperature, and soil moisture as well as average solar radiation, air temperature and wind speed. The results implied that both the components of the EGR, such as green vegetation and the soil substrate layer, and the microclimate created by the EGR can feed back and contribute to the thermal performance of an EGR. Through this full-scale EGR research in a subtropical monsoon climate, we provide the scientific basis and actionable practices for green roof planning and design to alleviate the urban heat island effect towards designing climate-resilient cities.

Both sides of the debate agree that large eggs in shallow nests laid in sun-exposed soil will experience clines in mean temperature and (especially) diel thermal variance; that embryos in the middle phase of development have the ability to reposition themselves, and room to do so; and that small changes in developmental temperatures can influence offspring fitness. Equally, all protagonists agree that thermal clines will be too low in some other kinds of nests, and that embryonic repositioning is impossible very early and very late in development. Based on an array of other fitness-enhancing behaviors exhibited by tetrapod embryos, and general principles for recognizing adaptation, we conclude that behavioral thermoregulation inside the egg likely is adaptive in some but not all reptile species.

The ecosystem sensitivity to temperature changes was quantified using the Q10 index. The seasonal behavior observed was related to the influence of other forcing factors and to the different state (density and activity) of the microbial biomass pool during the year. Environmental factors influencing microbial decomposition, such as the C:N ratio and litter input rate, showed intermediate sensitivity.

Roughness plays an important role in determining soil emissivity although it is not clear which roughness length scales are most relevant. Small-scale (i.e., smaller than the resolution limit) inhomogeneities across the soil surface and with soil depth caused by both spatially varying soil properties and topographic features may affect soil emissivity. In this paper, roughness effects were investigated by comparing measured brightness temperatures of well-characterized bare soil surfaces with the results from two reflectivity models. The selected models are the air-to-soil transition model and Shi's parameterization of the integral equation model (IEM). The experimental data taken from the Surface Monitoring of the Soil Reservoir Experiment (SMOSREX) consist of surface profiles, soil permittivities and temperatures, and brightness temperatures at 1.4 GHz with horizontal and vertical polarizations. The types of correlation functions of the rough surfaces were investigated as required to evaluate Shi's parameterization of the IEM. The correlation functions were found to be clearly more exponential than Gaussian. Over the experimental period, the diurnal mean root mean square (rms) height decreased, while the correlation length and the type of correlation function did not change. Comparing the reflectivity models with respect to their sensitivities to the surface rms height and correlation length revealed distinct differences.

The insect count information from the traps can be used for analyzing insect behavior by constructing biological models. In this work, stochastic models describing the effects of temperature and the time of day on the flight behavior of greenhouse whiteflies were developed. Sticky paper images and temperature data were collected from an organic tomato seedling greenhouse by using integrated wireless imaging and environmental sensors. The greenhouse whitefly counts were determined by processing the images using an insect counting algorithm. From the results obtained, differences between the flight rates of the greenhouse whiteflies for different ranges of temperature were observed. The relationship was shown to be best fit using a double Weibull distribution function with an r(2) of 0.988 and mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) of 0.001. Using the model, it was found that the optimal temperature for flight of greenhouse whiteflies was around 20-26 degrees C. From the real-time counting data, different daily peak flight times were discovered. The peak flight rates were modeled using multi-peak probability distribution functions where it shows that the multi- peak Gaussian distribution has the best fit with an r(2) of 0.961 and MSEP of 0.006.

The different methods provided similar estimates of N(2)O fluxes with an average over the whole of the common measurement period of around 6 ng N-N(2)O m(-2) s(-1). The 16 manual chambers showed coefficients of variation comprised between 30 and 150% during the 2 weeks of common observations. This variability may explain the unusual shape of the N(2)O concentration gradient in the atmosphere observed sometimes, which led to the conclusion that the gradient data set contained information allowing the spatial variability in N(2)O emission to be characterized, Hourly micrometeorological fluxes indicated a temporal variability of about 100% over daily periods, Microbial processes may be assumed to vary little over such a period and this temporal variability is probably a consequence of physical processes, such as air pressure fluctuations. Slight daily cycle tendencies were observed. The weak levels of N(2)O emissions were caused by rainfall deficit, which maintained the soil at a low water content, preventing strongly anaerobic conditions and the N fertilizer from leaching from the dry surface to wet soil layers.

Partitioning of transport into temperature layers shows that about one-half of this transport is of ''18 degrees C'' water (17 degrees C-19.5 degrees C); this can account for all of the ''excess'' 18 degrees C water observed in previous experiments. This excess is thought to be injected into the 18 degrees C layer in its region of formation in the northwestern North Atlantic Ocean. Due to its large thickness, potential vorticities in this layer in its area of formation are very low.

Red soil, one of the typical agricultural soils in subtropical China, plays important roles in the global carbon budget due to their large potential to sequester C and replenish atmospheric C through soil CO2 flux. We examined the relationship between Soil CO2 flux and environmental determinants in four different land use types of subtropical red soil-paddy (P), orchard (O), woodland (W) and upland (U) using static closed chamber method. Objectives were to evaluate the relationship of soil temperature, water-filled pore space (WFPS), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) with the soil CO2 flux. Soil CO2 fluxes were measured on each site about every 14 days between 09:00 and 11:00 a.m. during 14-July 2004 to 25-April 2007 at the experimental station of Heshengqiao at Manning, Hubei, China. Soil CO2 fluxes revealed seasonal fluctuations, with the tendency that maximum values occurred in summer, minimum in winter and intermediate values in spring and autumn except for paddy soil when it was submerged. Further, significant differences in Soil CO2 fluxes were observed among the four soils, following the order of P > O > U similar to W. Average soil CO2 fluxes were estimated as 901 +/- 114, 727 +/- 55, 554 +/- 22 and 533 +/- 27 (+/- S.D.) g CO2 m(-2) year(-1) in paddy, orchard, upland and woodland soils, respectively. Variations in soil CO2 flux were related to soil temperature, WFPS, and dissolved organic carbon with a combined R-2 of 0.49-0.75. Soil temperature was an important variable controlling 26-59% of soil CO2 flux variability. The interaction of soil temperature and WFPS could explain 31-60% of soil CO2 flux variations for all the land use types. We conclude that soil CO2 flux from red soil is under environmental controls, soil temperature being the main variable, which interact with WFPS and DOC to control the supply of readily mineralizable substrates.

Much of the heat is generated by the nest's microbial community, which might be differently affected by the addition of available carbon (C) sources in spring, when the nest temperature increases, than in summer, when the nest temperature is maintained at a high level. We used an incubation experiment to examine the effects of honeydew and resin on microbial activity and biomarkers' contents in ant nest and forest floor substrates. The effects of resin lasted longer than those of honeydew. Microbial activity was higher in the ant nest substrate than in the forest floor substrate, indicating that the microorganisms in the ant nest substrate were better adapted to utilize both C sources. Although bacteria were expected to be dominant after honeydew addition, this was not the case probably because the available C from honeydew had been depleted by the end of the incubation.

On one site, the frequency of freeze-thaw cycles increased under logging residues, while logging residues increased soil water content on another site, for certain measurement events. Logging residues did not affect available nutrients.

With the spider mites from the family Tetranychidae as subjects, the sex difference of life-history traits in responses to host plant and temperature were determined in this meta-analytic review. Across the 42 studies on 26 spider mite species (N = 8057 and 3922 for female and male mites, respectively), female spider mites showed longer developmental duration than the males in all except two species. The direction of sex difference in development was consistent regardless of temperature and host plant. The 16 spider mite species in 33 studies generally showed female-biased longevity, with an overall effect size of 0.6043 [95%CI = 0.4054-0.8031]. Host plant significantly influenced the sex difference in longevity, where the males lived longer than females below 22.5 celcius, but the reverse was true at higher and fluctuating temperature. Host plant also influenced the magnitude of sex difference in longevity, with females living longer than males when reared on herbs but not on trees. This study indicated that life-history traits are highly variable between sexes under temperature and host plant influence, highlighting that environmental conditions can significantly shape the direction and magnitude of sexual dimorphism of life-history traits.",,,,,"Zhang, Zhi-Qiang/L-6079-2019","Zhang, Zhi-Qiang/0000-0003-4172-0592; Li, Guang-Yun/0000-0002-0117-637X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-8162,1572-9702,,,,JUL,2021,84,3,,,,,497,527,,10.1007/s10493-021-00632-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-021-00632-4,,JUN 2021,,,,,,34125333,,,,,WOS:000661380400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Transcripts previously identified as rhythmically expressed with a 24-h period and circadian-regulated transcripts were more sensitive to WNT than were nonrhythmic transcripts.

Daily ingestion rates ranged from 3 to 96% of body C; egg production ranged from 4 to 35 % of body carbon. Mean ingestion and egg production rates during spring-summer were 1.9 and 1.5 times higher than average for the entire study, respectively. The average gross efficiency of egg production for the study was 80%; the spring-summer mean was 41 %. Bivariate and multiple-regression analyses revealed that the ingestion rate was dependent upon both temperature and food availability, but that, below 21-degrees-C, egg production depended more upon temperature than upon food concentration. To detect dietary preferences, the composition of diet was compared with that of the food supply. Selective feeding was infrequent, but the diet was often dominated by dinoflagellates and ciliates.

Mean annual water temperature and cumulative degree-days did not add to the explanatory power of the relationships. The faster growing natural cohorts included more benthos in their diet; however, benthos is not necessary to sustain the highest growth rates because the fastest growth rates were observed in enclosure cohorts that lacked benthic invertebrates. Cohorts in lakes and enclosures that had a high proportion of Daphnia in the zooplankton community also supported higher first-year growth rates. The results of the enclosure experiment suggest that the dominant mechanism creating growth variability is density-dependent intra-age-class competition.

The average R2 between measured and modeled Q(t) was 0.84 and the RMSE was 37 W m(-2) if predictive models were used for the assessment of lake specific Q(t)(Rn) functions. Two independent satellite-derived products were explored: the ARC-Lake (ATSR Reprocessing for Climate) product for water surface temperature using the ATSR (Along Track Scanning Radiometer) series data, and the CM SAP (Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring) product for solar radiation Rs based on the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data. The proposed procedure using purely satellite-derived data as inputs resulted in comparably good Q(t) estimates as those using in-situ measurements. The new Q(t) hysteresis model can thus be applied together with satellite measurements for supporting the computation of evaporation from open water bodies based on energy balance equations.

To understand how and why the soil microclimate changes after the plateau pika's disturbance, this study measured soil, vegetation, hydrologic and thermal properties and investigated soil moisture and soil temperature dynamics from 2014 to 2015 at the plot scale of four types of land surface: original grassland, new mound, old mound and bald patch. Our results showed that the average coefficients of surface runoff of original grassland, new mound, old mound and bald patch were 0.6, 3.0, 4.3 and 10.0%, respectively (P<0.05). Evapotranspiration was largest for original grassland, especially under wet conditions, and was similar among the other three types of land surface during the growing season (P<0.01). During varying precipitation events, the soil moisture content of new mound increased first, followed by old mound, original grassland and bald patch. Meanwhile, the increasing magnitude of soil moisture content had the same order. At the seasonal timescale, soil moisture content at 5-cm depth was largest for old mound and smallest for bald patch (P<0.01). The mean daily soil temperature at 5-cm depth of new mound was approximately 0.8 degrees C higher than that of old mound (P<0.01) because of the smaller land surface reflectance of the former. The daily range of soil temperature at 5-cm depth of original grassland and bald patch was about 2.7 and 4.7 degrees C higher than the average value of new and old mounds, respectively, because of the larger soil thermal conductivity of the former two. A conceptual framework is suggested in this study to synthesize the evolution of soil microclimate under disturbance by the plateau pika.

Here, we appraise interannual variation between 2 sympatric planarians (Crenobia alpina and Phagocata vitta) in upland Welsh streams over 25 y during which 1 of this pair (C. alpina) disappeared. We tested 3 nonexclusive hypotheses involving: 1) long-term changes in stream chemistry, 2) interspecific competition, and 3) climatic variation or directional change to explain this apparent local extinction. Several lines of evidence revealed potential exploitation competition between C. alpina and P. vitta. Coexistence was confined to conditions with high prey abundance (recorded as the abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) and summer temperatures <12.5 degrees C, whereas P. vitta dominated at sites with higher temperature, greater discharge, and lower prey abundance. The loss of C. alpina in the Llyn Brianne experimental catchments coincided with the largest-ever positive amplification of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) in 1989 to 1994, accompanied by increased stream temperature, increased winter discharge, 2 summer droughts, and markedly reduced prey abundance. We suggest that interspecific competition and this prolonged climatic event acted in concert to favor P. vitta over C. alpina. Since its local loss, summer stream temperatures have generally exceeded the favorable range for C. alpina and, coupled with weak dispersal ability, probably explain its continued absence. Our data are consistent with the prediction that extreme climatic events will affect small, fluctuating populations. Nevertheless, this case study demonstrates clear difficulties in identifying unequivocally the exact climatic processes causing extinction where: 1) evidence is confined to weak inference, 2) responses to complex climatic events are nonlinear, 3) interactions occur among species or between climate and ecological processes, and 4) assessments are made retrospectively following extinctions.",,,,,"Ormerod, Steve J/A-4326-2010","Ormerod, Steve J/0000-0002-8174-302X; Durance, Isabelle/0000-0002-4138-3349",,,,,,,,,,,,,0887-3593,,,,,DEC,2010,29,4,,,,,1367,1378,,10.1899/09-159.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/09-159.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000283891800015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effects of vegetation shading on past, present, and future activity budgets of two diurnal skinks from arid Australia",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavioral thermoregulation is an important mechanism allowing ectotherms to respond to thermal variations. Its efficiency might become imperative for securing activity budgets under future climate change. For diurnal lizards, thermal microhabitat variability appears to be of high importance, especially in hot deserts where vegetation is highly scattered and sensitive to climatic fluctuations. We investigated the effects of a shading gradient from vegetation on body temperatures and activity timing for two diurnal, terrestrial desert lizards, Ctenotus regius, and Morethia boulengeri, and analyzed their changes under past, present, and future climatic conditions. Both species' body temperatures and activity timing strongly depended on the shading gradient provided by vegetation heterogeneity. At high temperatures, shaded locations provided cooling temperatures and increased diurnal activity. Conversely, bushes also buffered cold temperature by saving heat. According to future climate change scenarios, cooler microhabitats might become beneficial to warm-adapted species, such as C. regius, by increasing the duration of daily activity. Contrarily, warmer microhabitats might become unsuitable for less warm-adapted species such as M.boulengeri for which midsummers might result in a complete restriction of activity irrespective of vegetation. However, total annual activity would still increase provided that individuals would be able to shift their seasonal timing towards spring and autumn. Overall, we highlight the critical importance of thermoregulatory behavior to buffer temperatures and its dependence on vegetation heterogeneity. Whereas studies often neglect ecological processes when anticipating species' responses to future climate change the strongest impact of a changing climate on terrestrial ectotherms in hot deserts is likely to be the loss of shaded microhabitats rather than the rise in temperature itself. We argue that conservation strategies aiming at addressing future climate changes should focus more on the cascading effects of vegetation rather than on shifts of species distributions predicted solely by climatic envelopes.",,,,,"Mihoub, Jb/B-7708-2015; Henle, Klaus/I-6837-2013; Grimm-Seyfarth, Annegret/I-9243-2019","Mihoub, Jb/0000-0002-5354-850X; Henle, Klaus/0000-0002-6647-5362; Grimm-Seyfarth, Annegret/0000-0003-0577-7508",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,SEP,2017,7,17,,,,,6803,6813,,10.1002/ece3.3238,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3238,,,,,,,,28904761,,,,,WOS:000409529800016,View Full Record in Web of Science

A high-precision macro wind velocity detector was employed to study the natural convective characteristics of both types of rock layers and their differences. The natural convection velocity in both types of rock layers resulting from the temperature difference was investigated for the first time through modeling experiment. Natural convection velocity in the hollow concrete brick layer with weak convection resistance was higher than that in the crushed rock layer. Their maximum velocities were 0.10 m/s and 0.08 m/s, respectively. The different heat transfer processes and their intensities resulting from the boundary temperature fluctuations were the primary reasons for inner asymmetric temperature fluctuation and decline. The cooling process closely related to convection time and convection velocity. The temperature difference was the key factor in the occurrence of convection and its intensity change, although the air temperature changes also had an effect on the airflow process. The occurrence of natural convection required a start-up temperature difference. Moreover, a linear relationship was observed between natural convection velocity and temperature difference.

Cynara cardunculus achenes are usually dormant at dispersal and require alternating temperatures to terminate dormancy and germinate. Laboratory and glasshouse experiments were conducted to determine (i) the treatments able to terminate dormancy and (ii) the effect of environmental factors and agronomic practices on germination and emergence of non-dormant (dry after-ripened) achenes. Scarification, hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite promoted germination of dormant achenes. Dry after-ripening and cold stratification were tested in two different populations. Dormancy of both populations was released from dormancy by dry after-ripening. In contrast, cold stratification allowed dormancy release in just one of the populations, while the other was induced into secondary dormancy. Germination of non-dormant (dry after-ripened) achenes was maximum in a range of temperatures from 10 to 20 degrees C and was inhibited at higher temperatures. Reduction of osmotic potential below -0.6 MPa led to a decrease in final germination. These results explain synchronic emergence of C. cardunculus seedlings in autumn after dormancy release during summer. Maximum seedling emergence was close to 60% at soil depths of 1 cm and only decreased as depth increased over 6 cm. In contrast, seedling emergence was not reduced by the presence of cover residues, while a flooding duration of 21 days was required to suppress emergence significantly. These results suggest that the deep burial of achenes and agronomic practices that take advantage of synchronic emergence of achenes could be useful tools leading to better long-term management of C. cardunculus.",,,,,,"Batlla, Diego/0000-0003-3850-7213; Huarte, Hector Roberto/0000-0003-3782-4380",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1737,1365-3180,,,,DEC,2018,58,6,,,,,450,462,,10.1111/wre.12331,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.12331,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000450600000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gridded fields of plant rooting depth, soil characteristics (texture, organic content), vegetation, and daily time series of precipitation and air temperature provide the primary inputs used to derive simulated runoff at a grid resolution of 25 kin across the pan-Arctic. The pan-Arctic water balance model (P/WBM) includes a simple scheme for simulating daily changes in soil frozen and liquid water amounts, with the thaw-freeze model (TFM) driven by air temperature, modelled soil moisture content, and physiographic data. Climate time series (precipitation and air temperature) are from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis project for the period 1980-2001. P/WBM-generated maximum summer active-layer thickness estimates differ from a set of observed data by an average of 12 cm at 27 sites in Alaska, with many of the differences within the variability (1sigma) seen in field samples. Simulated long-term annual runoffs are in the range 100 to 400 mm year(-1). The highest runoffs are found across northeastern Canada, southern Alaska, and Norway, and lower estimates are noted along the highest latitudes of the terrestrial Arctic in North America and Asia. Good agreement exists between simulated and observed long-term seasonal (winter, spring, summer-fall) runoff to the ten Arctic sea basins (r = 0.84). Model water budgets are most sensitive to changes in precipitation and air temperature, whereas less affect is noted when other model parameters are altered. Increasing daily precipitation by 25% amplifies annual runoff by 50 to 80% for the largest Arctic drainage basins. Ignoring soil ice by eliminating the TFM sub-model leads to runoffs that are 7 to 27% lower than the control run. The results of these model sensitivity experiments, along with other uncertainties in both observed validation data and model inputs, emphasize the need to develop improved spatial data sets of key geophysical quantities (particularly climate time series) to estimate terrestrial Arctic hydrological budgets better.

Growth experiments revealed that T. laevis was able to grow at 0 to 10 degrees C but not higher than 15 degrees C, indicating that its depth distribution mainly depended on temperature. High irradiances resulted in increased growth rates of T. laevis, with the highest rates of 0.50 d(-1) at 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).

Torpor is often associated with cold temperatures, but in the last decades, more diverse and flexible forms of torpor have been described. For example, tropical bat species maintain a low metabolism and heart rate at high ambient and body temperatures. We investigated whether bats (Nyctalus noctula) from the cooler temperate European regions also show this form of torpor with metabolic inhibition at high body temperatures, and whether this would be as pronounced in reproductive as in non-reproductive bats. We simultaneously measured metabolic rate, heart rate, and skin temperature in non-reproductive and pregnant females at a range of ambient temperatures. We found that they can decouple metabolic rate and heart rate from body temperature: they maintained an extremely low metabolism and heart rate when exposed to ambient temperatures changing from 0 to 32.5 degrees C, irrespective of reproductive status. When we simulated natural temperature conditions, all non-reproductive bats used torpor throughout the experiment. Pregnant bats used variable strategies from torpor, to maintaining normothermy, or a combination of both. Even a short torpor bout during the day saved up to 33% of the bats' total energy expenditure. Especially at higher temperatures, heart rate was a much better predictor of metabolic rate than skin temperature.

At the end of the cultivation cycle, only 451 +/- 46 (59.9%) of M. guyanensis individuals reached commercial size per meter of rope compared to 670 +/- 73 (89.3%) of M. strigata individuals. Survival rates were similar. Salinity and temperature increased progressively throughout the experiment with the reduction in rainfall and were within the range considered ideal for these species. In conclusion, the farming of both species of mussels was viable under estuarine conditions influenced by macrotides, with satisfactory survival rates and daily growth (shell height and weight).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0103-8478,1678-4596,,,,,2023,53,6,,,,,,,e20210777,10.1590/0103-8478cr20210777,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0103-8478cr20210777,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000862578800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

V.",,,Glycemia and free sugar levels of the goby Perccottus glehni depending on period before the beginning and after the end of hibernation,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The goby Perccottus glehni is one of the most winterhardy species of fresh-water eurythermal fish. Study of grounds of biochemical adaptation of these animals to hibernation under conditions of ice, which are currently absent, are of undoubted interest for understanding of the nature of hypometabolic states. This work deals with a study of changes in the content of glucose and other free sugars in goby blood and muscle tissue under different physiological states: active, prehibernation, and arousal after experimental cooling to negative near-zero temperature. A relatively high glycemia level with fluctuation amplitude from 9.8 +/- 2.1 to 24.4 +/- 2.4 mmol/ml is revealed. The minimal value of these fluctuations is recorded at the period almost coinciding with the beginning of hibernation, while the maximal value-at the period of artificial termination of the three-month hibernation in ice at -5A degrees C. The high blood glycemia level correlating with that in the muscle tissue might probably be due to a peculiar, probably, protector role of this sugar in adaptive mechanisms of the studied fish, not much due to winter hypothermia, but rather to winter hibernation on ice. The level of disaccharide maltose in muscle tissue that is maximal in April is predominantly in reciprocal dependence on the fructose content that is maximal in July. Dynamics of changes in the mono- and disaccharide content depending on the stage of preparation for hibernation basically coincided with the previously revealed dynamics for the fresh-water mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis, which indicates homology of mechanisms of the low-temperature adaptation for animals of different phylogenetic levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0930,,,,,JUN,2009,45,3,,,,,382,388,,10.1134/S0022093009030077,http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0022093009030077,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000268785800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of Experiment 1 was to evaluate the influence of 3 different final concentrations (3%, 6%, and 12%) of each CPA on sperm freezability. Sperm samples were diluted to a final sperm concentration of similar to 400 X 106 spermatozoa/mL with a Tris-citrate-fructose-EY extender (TCF) prior to freezing. Sperm cryosurvival was judged in vitro by microscopic assessments of individual sperm motility (SMI), viability, and plasma membrane (by means of the HOS test) and acrosome (NAR) integrities. Thawed samples were incubated at 37 degrees C for 2 hours in the freezing medium. At the end of this incubation period, sperm suspensions were again assessed. Our results showed that 12% of any CPA was toxic to red deer epididymal spermatozoa membrane integrity (P <.05). Moreover, regardless of the level of CPA, results indicated that the cryoprotective effects on red deer epididymal spermatozoa. of the 3 CPAs after thawing are in the following sequence: GLY > EG > PG (higher symbols mean P <.001). Furthermore, our results also showed an improvement in sperm parameters when the TCF diluent contained 6% of GLY. In Experiment 2 extenders were prepared using GLY 6%. This experiment was designed to investigate the effect of 2 different temperatures of GLY addition -22 degrees C (ambient temperature) and 5 degrees C- on sperm freezability.

Populations existing near the northern extent of a species' latitudinal range, such as spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus (Cuvier, 1830), in North Carolina, USA, are particularly vulnerable to winterkill. Information on cold tolerance for spotted seatrout is incomplete, which limits understanding of a likely important source of natural mortality for this species. In this study, two laboratory experiments for controlled exposure of spotted seatrout to dynamic decreases in water temperature were conducted in order to determine cold tolerance as affected by either rapid or prolonged exposure to low-temperature extremes across upper- (10) and lower estuarine (30) salinities. Under rapid exposure, spotted seatrout were unable to maintain equilibrium at temperatures <= 4 degrees C, with a small but measured mitigating effect of high salinity on the onset of observed physiological stress. No fish survived prolonged exposure (2 d) to 3 degrees C but spotted seatrout were tolerant of exposures to 5 degrees C for approximately 5 d, after which survival precipitously declined. Survival after 10-d exposure to 7 degrees C was high but not absolute. Salinity had no measured effect on mortality rates in the prolonged exposure trials. These empirical estimates of low-temperature thresholds, along with previously determined field estimates of instantaneous winter natural mortality rate (M), were used to develop models for predicting M. Historic daily water temperatures were used to estimate winter M of spotted seatrout from 1994 to 2015. Predictions of M suggest winterkill (>= 50% population loss) in eight of the last 22 years; these years correspond to anecdotal and fishery-independent observations of winterkill events in North Carolina. The results of this study provide strong evidence for thermally-limited overwinter survival of spotted seatrout at its northern latitudinal limits, where winterkill events can have population-level impacts.

J,"Elberling, B; Brandt, KK",,,,"Elberling, B; Brandt, KK",,,Uncoupling of microbial CO2 production and release in frozen soil and its implications for field studies of arctic C cycling,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Knowledge of seasonal trends and controls of soil CO2 emissions to the atmosphere is important for simulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations and for understanding and predicting the global carbon cycle. This is particularly the case for high arctic soils subject to extreme fluctuating environmental conditions. Based on field measurements Of Soil CO2 efflux, temperature, water content, pore gas composition in soil and frozen cores as well as detailed temperature experiments performed in the laboratory, we evaluated seasonal controls Of CO2 effluxes from a well-drained tundra heath site in NE-Greenland. During the growing season, near-surface temperatures correlated well with observed CO2 effluxes (r(2) > 0.9). However, during intensive thawing of near-surface layers we observed up to 1.5-fold higher effluxes than expected due to temperature alone. These high rates were consistent with high CO2 concentrations in frozen Soil (>10% CO2) and suggested a spring burst event during soil thawing and a corresponding trapping of produced CO2 during winter. Laboratory experiments revealed that microbial soil respiration continued down to a least -18 degreesC and that up to 80% of the produced CO2 was trapped in soil at temperatures between 0 and -9 degreesC. The trapping of CO2 in frozen soil was positively correlated with soil moisture (r(2) = 0.85)and led to an abrupt change of the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) observed for Soil CO2 release at 0 degreesC with Q(10) values below 0 degreesC being up to 100-fold higher than above 0 degreesC. The results of sub-zero CO2 production allowed us to predict the microbial soil respiration throughout the year and to evaluate to what extent burst events during thawing can be explained by the release of CO2 being produced and trapped during winter. Taking only the upper 20 cm of the soil into account, winter soil respiration accounted for about 40% of the annual soil respiration. At least 14% of the winter CO2 production was trapped during the winter 2000-2001 and observed to be released upon thawing. Thus, the site-specific winter soil respiration is an important part of the annual C cycle and CO2 trapping should be accounted for in future field and modelling studies of soil respiration dynamics in arctic ecosystems. In conclusion, we have discovered a soil moisture dependent uncoupling Of CO2 production and release in frozen soils with important implications for future field studies of Arctic C cycling.

We focus both on the impact of these climatic changes on the global hydrological cycle and on the amplitude of the increase of global and continental runoff over the last century, in relation to measured temperature increases. In this contribution, we propose an original statistical wavelet-based method for the reconstruction of the monthly discharges of worldwide largest rivers. This method provides a data-based approximation of the evolution of the annual continental and global runoffs over the last century. A consistent correlation is highlighted between global annual temperature and runoff, suggesting a 4% global runoff increase by 1 degreesC global temperature rise. However, this global trend should be qualified at the regional scale where both increasing and decreasing trends are identified. North America runoffs appear to be the most sensitive to the recent climatic changes. Finally, this contribution provides the first experimental data-based evidence demonstrating the link between the global warming and the intensification of the global hydrological cycle. This corresponds to more intense evaporation over oceans coupled to continental precipitation increase or continental evaporation decrease. This process finally leads to an increase of the global continental runoff. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Each sex may benefit from possessing different thermal performance capacities that would allow them to maximise their fitness relative to their different reproductive roles; especially when performances are closely related to reproductive success. Here, we examine sexual divergence in thermal sensitivities of performance across three populations of the Asian house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus) over an extensive latitudinal cline. Using analyses of the thermal sensitivity of routine activity, bite force and sprint speed, we explored whether: (i) males and females differed in their optimal temperatures for performance, (ii) the sexes differed in their thermal sensitivities of performance, and (iii) the degree of sexual divergence in thermal sensitivity varied among the populations. Because male H. frenatus are highly aggressive and frequently engage in combat to gain territories and mating opportunities, we expected males would be active over a wider range of temperatures than females and this would favour broad thermal sensitivity curves for males. In addition, we expected a greater divergence between the sexes in thermal sensitivities for the temperate populations that experience greater daily and seasonal thermal variation. We found that males were more active, and had greater bite forces and faster sprint speeds than females, independent of body size. In addition, we found differences between the sexes in thermal sensitivities for the tropical population; female H. frenatus were less active and possessed lower sprint speeds at higher temperatures than males. Although H. frenatus from the most variable thermal environments also displayed the broadest thermal performance range, it was the more stable tropical population that exhibited the greatest divergence between the sexes in thermal sensitivity of performance. The divergence in thermal physiology that we detected between the sexes of H. frenatus is consistent with the idea that males will derive mating and territorial advantages for maintaining function over a broader range of temperatures.",,,,,"Wheatley, Rebecca/AAT-8341-2020","Wheatley, Rebecca/0000-0001-8302-0370; Wilson, Robbie/0000-0002-0116-5427",,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,1432-136X,,,,JUL,2018,188,4,,,,,635,647,,10.1007/s00360-018-1149-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-018-1149-2,,,,,,,,29460146,,,,,WOS:000435594800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, the effects of habitat conditions and climate on trade-offs among fitness components remain poorly understood. For 2-5years, we quantified costs of experimentally increased reproduction in two populations (coastal long-season vs. inland short-season) of two long-lived orchids that differ in natural reproductive effort (RE; 30 vs. 75% fruit set). In both species, survival costs were found only at the short-season site, whereas growth and fecundity costs were evident at both sites, and both survival and fecundity costs declined with increasing growing season length and/or summer temperature.

However, studies on Eva in the soil or the mulch are greatly limited, and there is no information about comparison of Eva amounts under rice-straw and gravel mulch. This study evaluated the effects of rice-straw and gravel mulch on Eva in lysimeters and determined the environmental parameters affecting Eva. The weight of the lysimeter, soil moisture, air temperature, dew point and relative humidity were measured every 15 min. The phase of water vapour around the mulch might change to liquid water adsorbed by the soil under mulch, so the weight of the lysimeters for mulch regimes increased in the afternoon since the condensation water (the liquid phase of water) could be detected and weighed by lysimeters. No matter fine or cloud days, Eva or condensation might have occurred below the mulch due to the high oscillation of air humidity, which might result in a high vapour pressure gradient from the atmosphere to the soil, bringing about adsorption of water vapour by the soil. Eva increased as the daily fluctuation in air humidity and temperature increased. The high daily fluctuations of temperature could favour the high temperature gradient in the mulch, which caused that the water vapour fluxed downwards and it was probably adsorbed by the relative cooler soil under the mulch. The duration of adsorption is about 7 hours per day. A total amount of 200.4 mm of water vapour was adsorbed for rice-straw mulch during the experiment period (corresponding to 1.06 mm/day), which can satisfy 74.3% of the pan evaporation. Soil under straw mulch is able to adsorb vapour water in significant amounts, although previous studies have overlooked this fact. Eva is beneficial to plant since the liquid phase of water can be used by plant. In the morning, evaporated water from the adsorbed water used energy that would otherwise be used to evaporate soil water. The Eva might reach a peak value under the moderate soil moisture condition. Rice-straw mulch tended to adsorb more vapour than gravel mulch probably because rice-straw has larger surface area and the vapour concentration under straw mulch might be higher. The significance of Eva or condensation would be enhanced if condensation water could be stored by some methods, such as preventing condensation water evaporation by much thicker straw mulch.",,,,,", CC.

Time series analysis of several w'T' records shows that heat and momentum flux occur at nearly the same scales, typically by turbulent eddies of the order of 10-20 m in horizontal extent and a few meters in vertical extent. Probability distribution functions of w'T' have large skewness and kurtosis, where the latter confirms that most of the flux occurs in intermittent events with positive and negative excursions an order of magnitude larger than the mean value. An estimate of the eddy heat diffusivity in the outer (Ekman) part of the boundary layer, based on measured heat flux and temperature gradient during a diurnal tidal cycle over the Yermak Plateau slope north of Fram Strait, agrees reasonably well with the eddy viscosity, with values as high as 0.15 m2 s-1. An analysis of measurements made near the ice-ocean interface at the three stations shows that heat flux increases with both temperature elevation above freezing and with friction velocity at the interface. It also reveals a surprising uniformity in parameters describing the heat and mass transfer: e.g., the thickness of the transition sublayer (from a modified version of the Yaglom-Kader theory) is about 10 cm at all three sites, despite nearly a fivefold difference in the under-ice roughness z0, which ranges from approximately 2 to 9 cm.

As wind speed increased from 0.25 to 1.00 m s(-1), metabolic heat production increased by 0.94 W in the absence of solar radiation and by 0.98 W in the presence of 950 W m(-2) simulated solar radiation.

The coat of S, tereticaudus Is very sparse, and the observed heat transfer of 5.68+/-0.37 W m(-2) degrees C-1 (mean +/- S.E.M., N=11) is much higher than expected from either allometric equations or comparative studies with other rodents of similar mass. Solar heat gain was remarkably low, equalling only 10 % of intercepted radiation and suggesting a remarkably high regional thermal resistance at the tissue level.

The underlying hypothesis for INDOEX is that, during the northeasterly monsoon, the intruding aerosols and other anthropogenic pollutants can entrain into the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the Equatorial Indian Ocean and finally into the clouds, The altered clouds influence the radiative transfer processes at the regional and possibly global scale. The driving mechanism for the regional transport was the boundary layer circulation. In this study, it was hypothesized that the circulation pattern, which affects the regional transport, was strongly influenced by the land-air-sea interactions. To test this, a zonally symmetric version of a primitive equation numerical weather prediction model, called the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS), was used. A number of numerical experiments were performed for a 2-D domain ranging from 14 degreesN to 16 degreesS centered over 76 degreesE, In the experiments, the influence of land-sea interaction (differential heating), topography (Western Chats), and the thermal gradients (SST and land surface temperature) on the coastal circulations over Equatorial Indian Ocean were studied. Results indicated a strong land-air-sea interaction and feedback teleconnection between the local and large scale features. Interestingly, the model generated land influence to the order of 1000 km offshore in the simulation domain, consistent with different observations. Results suggest that the oceanic environment in the northeast monsoon over Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean can display significant diurnal variability and heterogeneity due to topography and surface temperature gradients, and that the local features have interactive feedback on the large scale circulations and transport.",,,,,"Niyogi, Dev/ABE-7554-2020","Niyogi, Dev/0000-0002-1848-5080",,,,,,,,,,,,,0011-3891,,,,,APR 10,2001,80,,,S,,,60,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000168698400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

By examining cold tolerance in overwintering eggs of C. facialis in relation to another cicada, Graptopsaltria nigrofuscata, whose population has recently decreased in Osaka, we tested the hypothesis that warming has caused the population increase of C. facialis by decreasing egg mortality due to winter temperatures. A short-term (24 h) cold exposure experiment demonstrated that the half-lethal temperatures (LT50) of C. facialis and G. nigrofuscata were -23.3 degrees C and -28.9 degrees C, respectively, although these extreme low temperatures never occurred in Osaka during the 20th century. Prolonged exposure to -5 degrees C for up to 30 days had no harmful effects on the hatching rate in either species. Overwintering mortality was also assessed under naturally fluctuating conditions by transferring eggs to cooler elevated sites that mimicked the environment prior to the current warming. Eggs of C. facialis that overwintered at the cooler site exhibited similar hatching rates to those maintained at the original site. The results of these experiments consistently indicated that overwintering eggs of C. facialis possess adequate tolerance to the low temperatures of the 20th century.

Serious haze episodes have been a seasonal event in Chiang Mai province for more than a decade. In 2008, local government agencies introduced comprehensive measures to control haze and limit its impacts on public health. This study assessed the acute effects of ambient air pollutants on all-cause mortality before and after the introduction of those haze control measures. Methods. We obtained daily mortality counts and data on mass concentrations of particulate matter <10 micron in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO2, O-3, and CO), and meteorology in Chiang Mai Province between January 2002 and December 2016. We analyzed the data using a case-crossover approach adjusting for temperature, relative humidity, seasonality, and day-of-week. We assessed change in the excess risks of all-cause mortality associated with an increase in interquartile range (IQR) of pollutant concentration before and after control measures came into force. Results. We found decreased PM10 levels and markedly reduced excess risks of daily mortality associated with an IQR increase in PM10 concentrations in the years after haze-control measures were implemented (2009-2016). We found mixed results for gaseous pollutants: SO2 showed no significant change in excess risk of daily mortality throughout the study period, while NO2 and CO showed significant excess risks only in the period 2012-2016, and 8-h maximum O-3 showed a decrease in excess risk despite an increase in its atmospheric levels after the introduction of haze control measures in 2008. Conclusions. The findings indicate that the government haze control measures first introduced in Chiang Mai province in 2008 have successfully reduced episodic PM10 concentrations, which has led to a decrease in short-term all-cause mortality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,MAY 27,2020,8,,,,,,,,e9207,10.7717/peerj.9207,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9207,,,,,,,,32518729,,,,,WOS:000535666000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

A wide range of wind and rain conditions were observed in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean near 10 degrees N, 125 degrees W in summer-autumn 2016 and 2017. Wind was the primary driver of near-surface turbulence and the mixing of rain-formed fresh lenses, with lenses generally persisting for hours when wind speeds were under 5 m s(-1) and mixing away immediately at higher wind speeds. Rain influenced near-surface turbulence primarily through stratification. Near-surface stratification caused by rainfall or diurnal warming suppressed deeper turbulent dissipation rates when wind speeds were under 3 m s(-1). In one case with 4-5 m s(-1) winds, rain-induced stratification enhanced dissipation rates within the stratified layer. At wind speeds above 7-8 m s(-1), strong stratification was not observed in the upper meter during rain, indicating that rain lenses do not form at wind speeds above 8 m s(-1). Raindrop impacts enhanced turbulent dissipation rates at these high wind speeds in the absence of near-surface stratification. Measurements of air-sea buoyancy flux, wind speed, and near-surface turbulence can be used to predict the presence of stratified layers.

The cooled perch system consisted of two replicates (CP-1 and CP-2) of three-tier cage units with galvanized perch pipes forming a complete loop in each tier (top, middle, bottom) in which chilled water circulated. A total of 324 White Leghorns at 17 weeks of age were randomly assigned to 36 cages (76 cm. 52 cm. 48 cm) in six banks placed in the same room. Flow for each loop was provided by loop pumps that drew chilled water from an open thermal storage manifold and returned it to the same manifold. Each thermal storage was cooled by continuously circulating water through a water chiller. Each loop pump was thermostatically controlled based on the cage air temperature. The water inlet and outlet temperatures, cage air temperatures, and loop water flow rates during stable system operation were measured for performance evaluation. Mean water flow rates in 2015 were 5.19 and 5.45 kg min(-1) for CP-1 and CP-2, respectively, but significantly declined to 3.91 and 4.03 kg min(-1) in 2016. The mean loop water temperature rise was about 2 degrees C for both replicates. The mean loop net heat gain of CP-1 and CP-2 ranged from 690 to 850 W and from 551 to 1,298 W, respectively, with a significant difference between CP-2 loops (p < 0.0001), indicating a discrepancy between the manufacturer's pump curve and field performance. There was a correlation between room air temperature and net heat gain for all loops of CP-1 and the top loop of CP-2 (p < 0.0001), suggesting that natural convection and radiation from the room to the pipe were the major contributors to loop heat gain. The average daily net heat gain was approximately 2,334 W per replicate, 256 W m(-1) perch length, or 43.2 W per hen housed.

A closed unheated Venlo greenhouse without crop in the area of Batna (southern Mediterranean basin) was considered. The study focuses on the effects of (i) the thermal inertia of the soil, (ii) the radiative losses through the cover, and (iii) the convection mode and flow regime on the heat transfer coefficients. Experiments were conducted from January to March 2008 under clear or cloudy skies, and low or high wind velocities. From the results, it is concluded that the heat stored in the ground of the greenhouse represents a significant heat source which can compensate the energy losses through the walls, especially during a night preceded by a high diurnal insulation. This process can maintain an average inside - outside temperature difference during the night within the range [1.59-2.81] K. Results also show that the radiation losses are the main component of the energy losses of the greenhouse, mainly through the outside wall surface of the cover. Conversely, the radiative heat exchange along the inner wall represents the main heat supply to this wall.

These coefficients both inside and outside the greenhouse were estimated and analyzed, and a good agreement with the models reported in the literature was found.

Spiny amaranth has become a successful invader and a troublesome weed in Xishuangbanna, but edible amaranth has not, although it is widely grown as a vegetable there. As seed germination is one of the most important life-stages contributing to the ability of a plant to become invasive, we conducted experiments to compare the effects of high temperature and water stress on seed germination in two varieties each of spiny amaranth and edible amaranth. Overall, the seeds of both amaranth species exhibited adaptation to high temperature and water stress, including tolerance to ground temperatures of 70 degrees C for air-dried seeds, which is consistent with their behavior in their native ranges in the tropics. As expected, the invasive spiny amaranth seeds exhibited higher tolerance to both continuous and daily periodic high-temperature treatment at 45 degrees C, and to imbibition-desiccation treatment, compared to edible amaranth seeds. Unexpectedly, edible amaranth seeds exhibited higher germination at extreme temperatures (10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 40 degrees C), and at lower water potential (below -0.6 MPa). It is likely that cultivation of edible amaranth has selected seed traits that include rapid germination and germination under stressful conditions, either of which, under natural conditions, may result in the death of most germinating edible amaranth seeds and prevent them from becoming invasive weeds in Xishuangbanna. This study suggests that rapid germination and high germination under stress conditions-excellent seed traits for crops and for many invasive species-might be a disadvantage under natural conditions if these traits are asynchronous with natural local conditions that support successful germination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,APR 17,2017,12,4,,,,,,,e0175948,10.1371/journal.pone.0175948,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175948,,,,,,,,28414779,,,,,WOS:000399874800079,View Full Record in Web of Science

Infective L3s of the trichostrongyloid nematodes Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcinta and Nematodirus battus, suspended in water, were exposed to direct UV irradiation in two experiments. In the first, during 6 days of constant illumination with UVA lamps at intensities simulating sunlight at ground level, the mortality rate was increased up to 100-fold compared with controls sheltered by UV-impermeable perspex. Significant differences in mortality rates were detected between the three species, with H. contortus the least sensitive. In the second experiment, larvae were exposed to natural sunlight during the temperate spring and summer, for 24-h periods on seven separate days representing a range of weather and UV doses. Mortality was again increased by UV exposure in all species, but was less in H. contortus than in T. circumcincta or N. battus. At higher daily UV doses, the mortality rate was on average 2.27 times higher in exposed larvae than in sheltered controls. Increased mortality caused by UV irradiation Could help to explain patterns of abundance of infective stages at pasture, especially pronounced population declines in spring when solar radiation rises rapidly and temperature is still low. Implications for the epidemiology of gastrointestinal nematode infection in ruminants, and for trade-offs in parasite life history, are discussed. (C) 2009 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

This study assesses the effect of different earthworm densities on soil water content (SWC) and evaporation in a laboratory experiment. Four earthworm densities (0 no-earthworm, control [C]; 207 earthworms m(-2), low density [LDE]; 345 earthworms m(-2), medium density [MDE]; and 690 earthworms m(-2), high density [HDE]) are tested in soil columns. Results show that cumulative evaporation occurs in the decreasing order of densities: C (98.6 mm) > LDE (115.8 mm) > MDE (118.4 mm) > HDE (124.6 mm). Compared with the control, earthworm activity decreases cumulative soil evaporation by 5.0-20.9%, increases soil temperature to 0.46 degrees C-0.63 degrees C at 8:00, and decreases soil temperature to 0.21 degrees C-0.52 degrees C at 14:00 on the soil surface. Temperature fluctuations reduce with increasing earthworm densities. A negative correlation is found between cumulative soil evaporation and earthworm density (R-2= 0.969,p< 0.001). Earthworms significantly (p< 0.05) decrease the surface SWC loss (0-20 cm) soil layer but increase the subsoil SWC loss (60-100 cm) by adjusting the soil temperature and reducing soil water evaporation. Earthworm activities (burrows, casts horizontal ellipsis ) improve the soil water holding ability by adjusting soil temperature and reducing soil water evaporation.

We investigated such effects within an insect assemblage from a tropical Australian stream. These systems are frequently subjected to catastrophic floods, often suggested to reduce the importance of predation in streams, and invertebrate faunas are characterised by relatively broad environmental tolerances. Impacts of the hunting predator Australopelopia prionoptera (Diptera: Chironomidae) and an undescribed ambush predator from the Polycentropodidae (Trichoptera) on survival and development of two species of tubicolous Chironomidae, Echinocladius martini (Orthocladiinae) and Polypedilum australotropicus (Chironominae), were assessed in laboratory microcosms. A further experiment investigated how impacts of Australopelopia varied over a broad range of temperatures, exceeding that experienced annually by the studied populations. Neither predator impacted survivorship for E. martini, but the presence of the polycentropodid caused E. martini to spend longer as larvae and reduced adult longevity, and adult females were smaller-sized and had smaller oocytes. In contrast, both predators reduced survivorship of P. australotropicus, but only Australopelopia affected its development, causing reductions in pupal duration and oocyte size. The observed non-lethal impacts of predation reflect the threat each predator is known to pose to each prey species in situ. Impacts of predation varied little with temperature, reflecting the broad thermal tolerances of all study species. The predator-specific responses of the prey species imply that predation is a significant selective force in tropical Australian streams, although fluctuation in intensity of predation associated with flooding may limit its importance for community structure and prey diversity at larger scales. Our results indicate a more limited scope for environmental modification of predator-prey relationships in faunas characterised by broad physiological tolerances.",,,,,"Pearson, Richard/GQH-2760-2022; McKie, Brendan G/C-9376-2013","McKie, Brendan/0000-0002-1796-9497; Pearson, Richard/0000-0001-6047-031X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,AUG,2006,149,2,,,,,328,339,,10.1007/s00442-006-0454-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0454-8,,,,,,,,16761141,,,,,WOS:000239735300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Treatments were as follows: warm-fed, warm-not fed, cold-fed, and cold-not fed during the winter (January-February). The following parameters were measured: length, weight, whole body lipid, liver glycogen, hepatosomatic index, and plasma levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and thyroxine (T4). Warm-fed fish grew continuously throughout the experiment from 21.5 +/- 0.3 to 43.4 +/- 1.4 g and were larger than fish in the other treatments. Fish in all other treatments grew from 21.5 +/- 0.3 to approximately 32 g and showed depressed growth during January and February. During the winter, liver glycogen, hepatosomatic index, plasma insulin, and IGF-I were highly influenced by manipulations in rearing conditions, whereas whole body lipid and plasma T4 were less affected. Plasma insulin levels fluctuated dramatically (from 2 to 7 ng/ml) in the two cold-acclimated groups shortly after the change in temperature. In general, the plasma insulin levels of the warm-fed fish were the highest (8-9 ng/ml), those of the warm-not fed fish were the lowest (2-5 ng/ml), and those of the two cold-acclimated groups were more variable but intermediate. In contrast, plasma IGF-I levels showed a decline with temperature decrease (from 9 to 5 ng/ml) and more gradual changes than insulin with the change in feeding. The highest plasma IGF-I levels were found in the warm-fed fish (10-15 ng/ml), the lowest levels were in the cold-not fed fish (4-5 ng/ml), and those of the warm-not fed and cold-fed fish were intermediate. During the treatment period the T4 levels were relatively unaffected by manipulations in feeding and temperature compared with either insulin or IGF-I. These data suggest that the insulin, IGF-I, and thyroid axes are differentially regulated under changing seasonal and/or environmental conditions in yearling salmon.

For all 131 taxa, seed germination was higher in light than in darkness for every temperature tested. Across species, the light requirement decreased significantly with increasing seed mass. For larger seeded species, germination in the dark reached higher levels under alternating than under constant temperatures. Gibberellic acid promoted germination in darkness whereas nitrates partially substituted for a light requirement only in species showing some dark germination. A light requirement for germination, observed in virtually all taxa examined, constitutes a collective characteristic of the family. It is postulated that smaller seeded taxa might germinate only on the soil surface or at shallow depths, while larger seeded species might additionally germinate when buried in the soil if cued to do so by fluctuating temperatures.",,,,,,"Daws, Matthew/0000-0002-9120-4724",,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,JAN,2014,113,1,,,,,135,143,,10.1093/aob/mct250,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mct250,,,,,,,,24232382,,,,,WOS:000329063300018,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"SINERVO, B; ADOLPH, SC",,,,"SINERVO, B; ADOLPH, SC",,,GROWTH PLASTICITY AND THERMAL OPPORTUNITY IN SCELOPORUS LIZARDS,ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"We studied the relationship between daily activity time and growth rate in hatchling sagebrush lizards (Sceloporus graciosus), a mainly montane species, and western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), which inhabit a broader range of thermal environments. The study involved two populations of each species along an altitudinal gradient in southern California and one population of S. occidentalis from Oregon. In the field daily activity time varied seasonally: activity periods were short during spring and fall and longer during the summer. Activity patterns also varied geographically: in montane and high-latitude environments, hatchlings experienced reduced opportunity for growth both daily and seasonally, because fewer, shorter days are available before the end of the activity season. We conducted laboratory experiments to measure the effect of the thermal environment on hatchling growth rates. Laboratory-incubated hatchlings had access to radiant energy for part of each day and were kept at 15-degrees-C (too low for activity) the rest of the day. The four experimental treatments (6, 9, 12 and 15 h of radiant energy per day) approximated the range of thermal environments encountered by hatchlings in the wild. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Mass-specific growth rates were plastic and generally increased with potential activity time in hatchlings from all populations. However, the form of this relationship varied among populations: growth rates of California S. occidentalis (''growth opportunists'') increased roughly linearly with potential activity time, whereas growth rates of Oregon S. occidentalis and California S. graciosus (''short-day specialists'') showed curvilinear responses to potential activity time. Interspecific and large-scale intraspecific differences in the form of the norm of reaction paralleled the differences in thermal environments encountered by hatchlings in nature. Populations of S. occidentalis at low elevation in California routinely experience short and long days of activity (e.g., 6-13 h/d) and the norm of reaction for growth rate increases linearly over this range. In contrast, populations of S. graciosus rarely experience days with > 9 h of activity and the norm of reaction for growth rate plateaus above 9 h/d. Similarly, nor-them populations of S. occidentalis from Oregon rarely experience days with > 9 h of activity and the norm of reaction for growth rate also plateaus above 9 h/d. On a large scale, therefore, growth responses appear to be appropriate to the thermal environments to which hatchlings are most commonly exposed. However, conspecific populations from different altitudes in California did not differ in growth response, although hatchlings experience different thermal environments in nature. We observed substantial among-family variation in growth rates of S. occidentalis, which may indicate genetic variation, a prerequisite for evolution by natural selection. Moreover, significant family x treatment interaction effects on growth rate that reflect underlying genotype x environment interactions indicate a genetic basis to the observed intraspecific and interspecific differentiation in the norm of reaction. Additional experiments demonstrated that (1) reducing food availability by 50% reduced growth rates by 50% in both species, and (2) growth rates did not differ between hatchlings whose eggs were incubated at 24-degrees vs. 27-degree-C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,APR,1994,75,3,,,,,776,790,,10.2307/1941734,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941734,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NE02900018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The fertilization experiment comprised 8 different treatments, with the following modifications: liming, magnesium and microelement fertilization and a change in the sward use made during the experiment so as to regenerate the sward and to improve the yielding potential. In the initial period, magnesium concentrations in the sward were assessed using the ASS technique after dry mineralization of samples and dissolution of the residue in diluted nitric acid. Later, the ICP technique was applied, including an internal reference sample for the methods. The cultivation measures caused variations in magnesium concentrations in the sward, depending on a number of factors, among which direct fertilization was not the most significant one. For example, the ambient temperature during the plant growing season strongly influenced the magnesium content, irrespectively of a cut. There was no effect of rainfall of the magnesium content, although atmospheric precipitation was able to raise considerably the charge of this element. In the second cut and under neutral soil pH, higher concentrations of magnesium were noted in the sward. This could have resulted from either the lower second swath yielding or the optimum conditions for the uptake of magnesium by the sward that occurred during its growth. The investigation results failed to provide an unambiguous answer to the question whether magnesium fertilization affected the concentrations of this element. Nonetheless, in order to maintain the production of valuable fodder it is essential to return systematically the elements taken up with plant yield to the soil. In intensively managed meadows, amounts of magnesium removed from the soil with the harvested biomass can be as high as several kilograms per hectare.",,,,,"Gondek, Krzysztof/AAB-8432-2019; Glab, Tomasz/A-2718-2013; Mierzwa-Hersztek, Monika/AAB-4048-2019; Kopeć, Michał/AAB-9146-2019","Gondek, Krzysztof/0000-0002-8721-8234; Glab, Tomasz/0000-0002-8910-250X; Mierzwa-Hersztek, Monika/0000-0002-9517-6943; Kopeć, Michał/0000-0002-9992-7695",,,,,,,,,,,,,1644-2296,,,,,DEC,2015,20,4,,,,,911,920,,10.5601/jelem.2015.20.1.791,http://dx.doi.org/10.5601/jelem.2015.20.1.791,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000365458300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experiments were carried out in a commercial-size greenhouse in which pepper was grown and in commercial poultry houses. Reducing the fan speed with the VFD system resulted in reductions in the airflow rate through the houses and energy consumption, the latter being much more significant. The study showed that VFD control can reduce electricity consumption compared with ON-OFF operation. In the present study, the average energy consumption with the VFD control system was about 0.64 and 0.75 of that with an ON-OFF system in the greenhouse and poultry houses, respectively. The average greenhouse daily air temperatures and humidity ratios obtained with each control system between 07:00 and 18:00 were nearly equal. The results obtained in the greenhouse further showed that the VFD system has a greater potential than the ON-OFF, to reduce the range of amplitude variations in the air temperature and humidity ratio within the greenhouse. The average air temperatures over day and night, in the poultry houses, with each control system were nearly equal. The relative humidity, however, was slightly lower with VFD than with ON-OFF.

This analysis was undertaken in an attempt to quantify the effects of limited water on maize growth and yield by extending a simple, mechanistic model in which temperature regulates crop development and intercepted solar radiation is used to calculate crop biomass accumulation. A soil water budget was incorporated into the model by accounting for inputs from rainfall and irrigation, and water use by soil evaporation and crop transpiration. The response functions of leaf area development and crop gas exchange to the soil water budget were developed from experimental studies. The model was used to interpret a range of field experiments using observed daily values of temperature, solar radiation, and rainfall or irrigation, where water deficits of varying durations developed at different stages of growth. The relative simplicity of the model and its robustness in simulating maize yields under a range of water-availability conditions allows the model to be readily used for studies of crop performance under alternate conditions. One such study, presented here, was a yield assessment for rainfed maize under possible greenhouse climates where temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration were increased. An increase in temperature combined with decreased rainfall lowered grain yield, although the increase in crop water use efficiency associated with elevated CO2 concentration, ameliorated the response to the greenhouse climate. Grain yields for the greenhouse climates as compared to current conditions increased, or decreased only slightly, except when the greenhouse climate was assumed to result in severely decreased rainfall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-1962,,,,,NOV-DEC,1991,83,6,,,,,1052,1059,,10.2134/agronj1991.00021962008300060023x,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1991.00021962008300060023x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GT93600022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given fundamental energetic trade-offs among growth, maintenance and reproduction, individual differences in energy saving should have consequences for survival and reproductive success. Many endotherms use periodic heterothermy to reduce energy and water requirements and individual variation in heterothermy should have fitness consequences. However, attempts to disentangle individual- and population-level variation in heterothermy are scarce. 2. Here, we quantified patterns of heterothermy of 55 free-ranging eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), food-hoarding hibernators. Over five hibernation periods, we obtained a total of 7108 daily individual heterothermy indices (median: 118 per individual). 3. Based on an individual reaction norm approach, we found that the use of heterothermy was repeatable and varied among individuals of the same population under similar environmental conditions. This among-individual variation had consequences for winter survival and reproductive success. Individuals using less heterothermy at the beginning of the winter had decreased survival in resource-rich but not in resource-poor years and higher reproductive success in the subsequent breeding season. 4. These results support the hypothesis that fluctuating selection maintains heterothermic diversity and suggest that individualized ecophysiology can contribute to a more thorough understanding of the evolution of energy-saving strategies in endotherms.",,,,,"REALE, Denis/AAG-1571-2020; Dammhahn, Melanie/AAD-5479-2019; Garant, Dany/D-7406-2013","REALE, Denis/0000-0002-0419-7125; Garant, Dany/0000-0002-8091-1044",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,APR,2017,31,4,,,,,866,875,,10.1111/1365-2435.12797,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12797,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000398543900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigated CH4 fluxes in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau in response to climate warming and cooling.

Although the effects of warming and cooling varied depending on vegetation type, elevation and timescale (i.e., daily and seasonally), warming increased average seasonal CH4 uptake by 60 %, while cooling reduced it by 19 % across all vegetation types, based on a 1.3-5.1 A degrees C difference in soil temperature at 20 cm depth. Soil temperature over the range of 4-10 A degrees C explained 11-25 % of the variation in average seasonal CH4 fluxes, while there was no relationship with soil moisture over the range of 13-39 % and soil NH4 (+)-N and NO3 N- content. Methane uptake was more sensitive to warming than to cooling. Because of warming and cooling spells in the alpine region, warming effects on CH4 uptake would be over-estimated by 64 % if cooling effects on it are not considered.

Therm. Biol. 26 (2001) 281]. In emu hatchlings that are precocial like chickens, Type II HR oscillation also occurred, but less frequently in comparison with chick hatchlings [Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part A 131 (2002) 787]. This present experiment was conducted to elucidate how IHR of emu hatchlings responds to changes in Ta. Six hatchlings were measured for IHR and skin temperature (Ts) during a 3-h period when they were exposed to controlled Ta (ca. 35 degreesC), lowered Ta (ca. 15-30 degreesC) and again the controlled Ta for individual 1-h periods. In response to all the cooling and re-warming procedures, HR baseline changed depending upon the intensity of the Ta differences; i.e. large differences of Ta produced large changes in HR. HR fluctuations tended to augment during cooling with a few exceptions, but LF oscillation was not produced. Thus, LF oscillation, which was scarce even at the controlled Ta, could not be used as a thermoregulatory indicator in emus. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Our starting point was a fine-scale, multilayer model of half-hourly canopy processes that has been parametrized for Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. Over varied growing season conditions, this fine-scale model predicted hourly carbon and latent energy fluxes that were in good agreement with data from eddy covariance studies. Using an heuristic process, we derived a simple aggregated set of equations operating on cumulative or average values of the most sensitive driving variables (leaf area index, mean foliar N concentration, canopy height, average daily temperature and temperature range, atmospheric transmittance, latitude, day of year, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and an index of soil moisture). We calibrated the aggregated model to provide estimates of GPP similar to those of the fine-scale modal across a wide range of these driving variables. Our calibration across this broad range of conditions captured 96% of fine-scale model behavior, but was computationally many orders of magnitude faster. We then tested the assumptions we had made in generating the aggregated model by applying it in different ecosystems. Using the same parameter values derived for Harvard Forest, the aggregated model made sound predictions of GPP for wet-sedge tundra in the Arctic under a variety of experimental manipulations, and also for a range of forest types across the OTTER (Oregon Transect Ecosystem Research) transect in Oregon, running from coastal Sitka spruce to high-plateau mountain juniper.",,,,,"Goulden, Michael L/B-9934-2008; Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016","Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208; Rastetter, Edward/0000-0002-8620-5431; Goulden, Michael/0000-0002-9379-3948",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,AUG,1997,7,3,,,,,882,894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XQ08100011,View Full Record in Web of Science

D.; Lize, A.",,,Thermal environment during and outside courtship jointly determine female remating rate in Drosophila melanogaster,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,,,,,,,,,,,,"The behaviour of animals, particularly ectotherms, occurs in the context of daily and seasonal fluctuations in temperature and year-on-year increases in temperature associated with global climate change. Despite the importance of mating rate as a determinant of the intensity of male/female conflict over reproduction, the effects of ecological factors such as thermal environment on this process are poorly understood. We examined how temperature affects female remating rate in Drosophila melanogaster. The mating behaviour of D. melanogaster shows a circadian rhythm, and we partitioned thermal environment effects into those experienced at the point of courtship and those experienced outside courtship bouts. Temperature during and outside courtship both affected female remating rate, and did so in an approximately additive fashion. We found that female remating rate was more sensitive to thermal environment at the point of courtship than that encountered outside courtship periods. Elevation of temperature during courtship increased male courtship intensity, and we hypothesize that this directly increased a female's likelihood of remating. Our results highlight the importance of thermal conditions during and after courtship in determining mating rate in Drosophila and we discuss its implication for rates of polyandry in natural populations in terms of daily, seasonal and spatial variation, and changes that may be associated with climate change.

Though not significantly different to 8 C, a base temperature of 8.6-9.4 degrees C (T(b)8.6-T(b)9.4) adequately estimated thermal time (TT) durations for the emergence-flowering phase while T(b)0 was more satisfactory for estimating grain filling duration. Delayed planting either reduced (Waikato) or increased (Manawatu) the emergence-flowering duration and this was associated with changes in leaf number and phyllochron length. The phyllochron averaged 47 degrees Cd, but increased to 51 degrees Cd when soil temperature, radiation and precipitation between emergence and tassel initiation were respectively >22 degrees C, <= 17 MJ m(-2) d(-1) and <= 30 mm. Sub-optimal temperatures and radiation under late plantings triggered a source limitation, leading to assimilate remobilization, reduced grain filling duration and resulted in higher grain moistures at physiological maturity (36% vs. 30%). When rainfall between emergence and flowering was >= 234 mm, increases in average daily irradiance (19.5-21.4 MJ m(-2) d(-1)) and mean temperature (15-18 degrees C) increased pre-flowering crop growth rate (CGR) by 1 gm(-2) (degrees Cd)(-1). With late planting, higher pre-flowering radiation (>= 21 MJ m(-2)) and temperatures (>= 17 degrees C) increased CGR while low post-flowering radiation (13 MJ m(-2) d(-1)) and temperature (15.7 degrees C) reduced CGR. Kernel growth rate (KGR) was more stable across PDs and hybrids when TT was used (0.36-0.38 mg (degrees Cd)(-1)). Provided temperature was >= 19 degrees C, low daily irradiance (11 MJ m(-2) d(-1)) did not significantly reduce KGR. More rapid leaf senescence occurred for early and late plantings, and this was attributed to source-sink imbalances caused by assimilate accumulation or shortage. Leaf senescence rates in the absence of water stress were 0.03% (degrees Cd)(-1) between anthesis and mid grain-fill, and increased to 0.2% ( Cd)(-1) towards the end of grain filling.

R.",,,Broiler egg storage induces cell death and influences embryo quality,POULTRY SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"It is well known that egg storage reduces embryo performance, but the fundamental reasons for reduced embryo quality remain unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate possible cellular and molecular mechanisms that might reduce embryo quality after egg storage. Broiler hatching eggs were obtained from the Ross 308 broiler strain, divided into 2 groups, and stored (4 and 14 d) under the same temperature and humidity conditions. Samples of the eggs were used to assess embryo quality by determining daily embryo weight (wet and dry) from 4 to 21 d of incubation. To understand possible cellular and molecular mechanisms that might affect embryo quality, blastoderms (unincubated embryos) were isolated from a sample of eggs from each storage group, dissociated into single cells, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis to differentiate between viable, apoptotic, and necrotic cell populations. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was used to compare the expression of selected apoptotic genes (Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer gene, Bcl-2-associated X gene, Bcl-2-related ovarian killer gene, B-cell lymphoma 2 gene, and B-cell lymphoma xL gene) in blastoderms and embryos (6 d old after incubation). Data were analyzed by the MIXED model procedure of SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), with significance set at P <= 0.05. After covariance analysis of initial egg weights, the results showed decreased daily embryo weights (wet and dry), an indication of decreased embryo quality that could affect hatch quality. In addition, a decrease in blastodermal cell viability was associated with an increased percentage of apoptotic cell deaths (P < 0.0001). Expression of pro-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer gene, Bcl-2-associated X gene, and Bcl-2-related ovarian killer gene) were upregulated at the blastodermal level as the storage duration increased, but all genes were downregulated after 6 d of incubation. This suggests that an increase in egg storage duration could activate mechanisms of apoptotic cell death at the blastodermal level, which may be one of the molecular mechanisms that leads to reduced daily embryonic weight during incubation. Experimental controls capable of reducing the cellular and molecular mechanisms of egg storage should be used to increase embryo quality.",,,,,"Barreda, Daniel/A-2613-2014","Barreda, Daniel/0000-0003-4630-2840",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1525-3171,,,,AUG 1,2011,90,8,,,,,1749,1757,,10.3382/ps.2011-01361,http://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2011-01361,,,,,,,,21753212,,,,,WOS:000292688900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

If mulching could insulate soil not only for temperature, but also for evaporation, more energy might be saved. Two experiments at commercial greenhouses were done to test soil insulation. The first experiment aimed to test materials and strategies. This experiment showed that a mulch of styromul bound together with synthetic glue or paper cellulose did not inhibit or harm the crop. In the second experiment soil was insulated using: Biofoam (R) (5 mm layer), Styromul (5 mm layer), Biofoam (R) glued together with synthetic glue (20 mm layer, Biofoam (R) glued together with organic glue (20 mm layer), styromul glued together with synthetic glue (20 mm layer) and an untreated control. Slightly increased evaporation using any mulch layer was measured. However, soil temperature was also higher because of soil heating resulting in higher evaporation of the soil. Net evaporation is calculated to have been decreased by 12% using 20 mm instead of 5 mm mulch, which is expected to result in energy saving of 11.1 MJ.m(-2).yr(-1) on humidity control, which is too low to make up for the cost.

However, some growers want to harvest even earlier with good internal colour for advanced shipping. In an attempt to promote earlier internal yellow colour expression of gold kiwifruit, 'Haegeum' vines were cultivated in a plastic vinyl house for 2 years and compared with control vines in field cultivation. Kiwifruit cultivated within a plastic house developed yellow internal flesh colour (hue angle 103 degrees) 15 days earlier than the control. They also had increased dry matter content earlier while fruit firmness was similar compared with the control. The main cause of earlier yellow colour expression was attributed to the wider range of daily temperature than field grown vines. The average daily temperature difference was 15.3 degrees C (max. 25.5 degrees C) in the house and 11.4 degrees C (max. 18.8 degrees C) in the field. Cold storage of these earlier maturing fruits showed no negative impact on fruit quality for commercial sale. The growth of experimental vines was not affected in either year.

Timing of birth/hatching may have strong effects on offspring fitness. Breeding time is generally considered to have evolved to match offspring arrival with optimal seasonal environmental conditions, though this is rarely tested experimentally and factors shaping the relations between timing of birth and reproductive success are often poorly understood. 2. By manipulating incubation temperature of Atlantic salmon embryos, and hence controlling for maternal and genetic effects, we obtained offspring emerging from nests prior to (accelerated), during and after (decelerated) normal emergence times, and accordingly experienced widely different seasonal environmental conditions at emergence (stream temperature range 4-16 degrees C). The accelerated group emerged at temperatures that are generally considered to be highly sub-optimal for growth and likely imposes strong constraints on feeding and activity, and during a peak in water discharge which is expected to negatively influence habitat availability. 3. In the wild, overall mortality during the period after emergence was 79%, and was significantly affected by both release density and emergence timing. Accelerated offspring, which emerged earliest and experienced the harshest environmental conditions, had both highest survival and largest final body size. The effect was particularly strong at the high density release site, where survival of accelerated offspring was significantly higher than both the normal and decelerated groups. 4. In more controlled semi-natural environments, all developmental groups were able to perform well, but accelerated offspring had a relatively better performance than the later emerging offspring when density was high. Furthermore, the relative performance of the different groups was not sensitive to water discharge regimes (temporally stable vs. fluctuating). 5. These results suggest that the performance of offspring in relation to seasonal timing of emergence is highly affected by competitive interactions in Atlantic salmon. Although a match between phenology and optimal seasonal environmental conditions may be highly important for organisms depending on specific resources that are only available during a limited period of the season, such resources may be available in variable amounts year around for many organisms. For these, offspring success may to a larger degree be shaped by the timing of their hatching/birth relative to each other, and particularly so under high population densities.",,,,,,"Einum, Sigurd/0000-0002-3788-7800; Robertsen, Grethe/0000-0003-1301-8325",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAR,2011,80,2,,,,,365,374,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01783.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01783.x,,,,,,,,21155770,,,,,WOS:000286985800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hypotheses: (1) Environmental effects have more of an impact on hatch time than maternal effects. (2) Maternal effects have more of an impact on hatchling size than environmental effects. (3) Egg size affects the degree of plasticity of hatch time and hatchling size. Methods: In a split-brood common-garden experiment, brook trout embryos were individually incubated in four treatments consisting of two temperatures: stable (5 degrees C) and fluctuating (range 2 to 8 degrees C, mean 5 degrees C), and two pH values: benign (6.5) and stressful (5.25). Results: The environmental variables affected hatch time in that the fluctuating-temperature/benign-pH treatment combination had a significantly longer hatch range (decreased hatching synchrony) than the other treatment combinations. However, maternal effects (egg size) over-shadowed environmental effects on hatch size. Larger eggs produced longer hatchlings. In addition, larger eggs were more plastic, suggesting maternal effects influenced the degree of plasticity.",,,,,,"Penney, Heather/0000-0001-7259-3931",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-0613,1937-3791,,,,MAR,2018,19,2,,,,,171,194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000452886700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, our future water resources may also simultaneously suffer from other environmental threats such as elevated amounts of humic content and consequent increased water colour, a phenomenon called brownification'. In order to investigate the effects of temperature and water colour in combination, we performed a mesocosm experiment combining a 3 degrees C increase in temperature and a doubling in water colour. With this, we created a projected future scenario for our water resources, and we specifically focused on how these changes would affect cyanobacterial bloom formation and toxicity. We showed that despite total cyanobacterial biomass remaining unaffected, the abundance of one individual cyanobacterial species, Microcystis botrys, increased in response to the combination of elevated temperature and increased water colour. Furthermore, population fluctuations in M.botrys explained the majority of the variations in microcystin concentrations, suggesting that this species was responsible for the more than 300% higher microcystin concentrations in the future scenario treatment compared to the ambient scenario. Hence, it was not a change in cyanobacterial biomass, but rather a species-specific response that had the most profound impact on bloom toxicity. We argue that understanding such species-specific responses to multiple stressors is crucial for proper management decisions because toxic blooms can significantly affect both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, as well as ecosystem services such as drinking water supply and recreation.",,,,,"Faassen, Elisabeth/P-5411-2015; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Faassen, Elisabeth/0000-0001-9098-8662; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,NOV,2013,58,11,,,,,2414,2422,,10.1111/fwb.12220,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12220,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000325156400018,View Full Record in Web of Science

A field experiment was conducted to examine responses of total soil and microbial respiration, and microbial biomass to experimental warming and increased precipitation in a semiarid temperate steppe in northern China since April 2005. We measured soil respiration twice a month over the growing seasons, soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), microbial respiration (MR) once a year in the middle growing season from 2005 to 2007. The results showed that interannual variations in soil respiration, MR, and microbial biomass were positively related to interannual fluctuations in precipitation. Laboratory incubation with a soil moisture gradient revealed a constraint of the temperature responses of MR by low soil moisture contents. Across the 3 years, experimental warming decreased soil moisture, and consequently caused significant reductions in total and microbial respiration, and microbial biomass, suggesting stronger negatively indirect effects through warming-induced water stress than the positively direct effects of elevated temperature. Increased evapotranspiration under experimental warming could have reduced soil water availability below a stress threshold, thus leading to suppression of plant growth, root and microbial activities. Increased precipitation significantly stimulated total soil and microbial respiration and all other microbial parameters and the positive precipitation effects increased over time. Our results suggest that soil water availability is more important than temperature in regulating soil and microbial respiratory processes, microbial biomass and their responses to climate change in the semiarid temperate steppe. Experimental warming caused greater reductions in soil respiration than in gross ecosystem productivity (GEP). In contrast, increased precipitation stimulated GEP more than soil respiration. Our observations suggest that climate warming may cause net C losses, whereas increased precipitation may lead to net C gains in the semiarid temperate steppe. Our findings highlight that unless there is concurrent increase in precipitation, the temperate steppe in the arid and semiarid regions of northern China may act as a net C source under climate warming.",,,,,"Wan, Shiqiang/B-5799-2009; Wan, Shiqiang/L-9166-2019","Wan, Shiqiang/0000-0003-0631-1232; Wan, Shiqiang/0000-0003-0631-1232",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JAN,2009,15,1,,,,,184,195,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01728.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01728.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000262347600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increasing the dietary crude protein (CP) content may help to correct the reduced AA intake by HS pigs, but it may further increase their body heat load. Increasing the AA intake by adding free AA to the diet does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two 21-d experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, 30 pigs (31.1 +/- 1.2 kg initial body weight) were used to determine the performance depression because of HS. Treatments were: thermo neutral pigs fed a 22% CP control diet (TN-C); HS pigs fed the control diet (HS-C); HS pigs fed a 14% CP, AA supplemented diet (HS-AA). HS pigs had lower ADG and Lys utilization efficiency, and consumed 20 and 25% less Lys and Thr, respectively, than the TN-C pigs (P < 0.05). In Exp. 2 (comparative slaughter), 25 pigs (33.6 +/- 0.65 kg initial body weight) were used to evaluate the effect of extra dietary AA either as protein-bound or free AA on the performance and carcass traits of HS pigs. Treatments were: control wheat-SBM-free Lys, Thr and Met diet (CON); diet with 30% more CP than CON (HSxP); diet added with free AA to contain at least 25% more of each AA than the recommended level (HSxAA). Ambient temperature (AT) ranged from 27.7 to 37.7 degrees C, and body temperature (39.9 to 41.2 degrees C) followed a similar daily pattern as the AT did. There was no dietary treatment effect on daily feed and NE intake (P > 0.10), but the Lys, Thr, and Met intake was higher in pigs fed the HSxP or HSxAA diets than in pigs fed the CON diet (P < 0.05). The daily weight gain (ADO) was not affected (P > 0.10) but G:F tended to be higher and the Lys utilization efficiency (ADG, g/g Lys intake) tended to be lower in HSxP pigs than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). The HSxAA pigs had higher ADG (P < 0.05), and tended to have higher weight of hot carcass and leg muscle, and the weight gain of hot carcass and leg muscle than the CON pigs (P < 0.10). The weight and daily weight gain of loin muscle was higher in the HSXAA than in the HSxP pigs (P < 0.05). Kidney weight and serum urea in HSxP pigs were higher than in CON and HSxAA pigs, but spleen weight was higher in HSxAA pigs than in CON and HSxP pigs (P < 0.05). These results confirm that HS reduces the VFI, and show that increased levels of AA either as free or protein-bound do not additionally reduce the VFI of HS pigs. These also show that extra free AA supply rather than protein-bound AA better ameliorate the reduced growth performance of HS pigs.",,,,,,"Chavez Espinoza, Miguel/0000-0001-7293-3908; Morales, Adriana/0000-0002-6721-2257",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8812,1525-3163,,,,APR,2018,96,4,,,,,1419,1429,,10.1093/jas/sky044,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jas/sky044,,,,,,,,29471400,,,,,WOS:000430344400020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Only acclimated eggs demonstrated a significant decrease in SCP, from -20.7 +/- 0.3 to -22.9 +/- 0.3 degrees C, among all experimental groups compared to non-acclimated stages. Survival increased by 17.5% for eggs, 40.0% and 13.3% for 3rd and 5th instar larvae, and by 20.0% for pupae after CA Compared to controls, survival of eggs under the conditions of thermoperiod (5:15 degrees C), thermoperiod (5:15 degrees C) + RHH, and thermoperiod (5:15, 10:20, and 15:25 degrees C) + RCH significantly increased. In addition, survival of 3rd and 5th instar larvae and pupae increased under the conditions of thermoperiod (5:15 degrees C) and thermoperiod (5:15 degrees C) + RCH, possibly due to the induction of heat shock proteins or cryoprotectants. However, the pre-treatments of thermoperiod + RCH + RHH and thermoperiod + RHH + RCH did not significantly enhance survival of any developmental stage.

The timing of its larval development can be highly variable, and the synchrony of larvae with parasitoids may affect their risk to be parasitized. We estimated the effects of both oviposition date and site on the timing of larval development by allowing experimental eggs, which were laid on various dates during the oviposition period, to overwinter both above and below snow level, and on both the northern and southern sides of tree trunks. Accumulation of thermal sum was used to quantify the effect of oviposition date on the timing of egg hatch. To assess whether the timing of larval development affected the risk of parasitism, the larval stages susceptible to parasitism and the length of the parasitoid flight period were determined by exposing host larvae to parasitoids. Unlike previously assumed, the thermal sum required for egg hatching began to accumulate already in autumn, and autumn and spring temperatures additively determined the timing of egg hatch. The first-laid eggs accumulated 70% of the thermal sum required for hatching in autumn whereas the last-laid eggs accumulated less than 3%. Accordingly, because the oviposition period of E. autumnata is long and its timing is variable between years, the period of egg hatching also is long and can be variable between years. However: the flight periods of most parasitoid species exceeded the spread of hatching times and developmental stages of larvae. Only during years of low parasitoid density may thr variability in egg hatching rimes create a temporal refuge for some larvae, contributing to the increase of E. autumnata populations.",,,,,"Kaitaniemi, Pekka/A-2022-2008","Kaitaniemi, Pekka/0000-0002-5162-242X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,MAR,1999,84,3,,,,,435,442,,10.2307/3546422,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3546422,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000078916600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

To account for this, we have implemented a thermodynamic sea-ice module in COSMO and performed simulations at a resolution of 15 km and 5 km for the Laptev Sea area in April 2008. Temporal and spatial variability of surface and 2-m air temperature are verified by four automatic weather stations deployed along the edge of the western New Siberian polynya during the Transdrift XIII-2 expedition and by surface temperature charts derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. A remarkable agreement between the new model results and these observations demonstrates that the implemented sea-ice module can be applied for short-range simulations. Prescribing the polynya areas daily, our COSMO simulations provide a high-resolution and high-quality atmospheric data set for the Laptev Sea for the period 14-30 April 2008. Based on this data set, we derive a mean total sea-ice production rate of 0.53 km(3)/day for all Laptev Sea polynyas under the assumption that the polynyas are ice-free and a rate of 0.30 km(3)/day if a 10-cm-thin ice layer is assumed.

The water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and electrical conductivity (EC) were measured on an hourly basis in the open space and inside the ADP, and a phenomenological study was performed, dividing seasons into normal and rainy seasons and environments into stagnant and circulating conditions. The results showed that the water quality parameters inside the ADP exhibit lower fluctuations and diurnal variations compared with the open space. On average, the water temperature inside the ADP is lower than outside it by 1.7-3.7 degrees C in stagnant conditions, and by 0.6-0.7 degrees C in circulating conditions during early summer. Thermal stratification occurs inside the ADP but is temporarily disturbed due to the mixing from the forced circulation and the rainwater input through rainfall events. The ADP provided a constant and optimal water temperature for living and spawning for bitterling (i.e., 15.0-21.0 degrees C), which dominated in experimental pond during spring to summer. Most importantly, the ADP was able to significantly reduce the thermal stress of the fish in the study site, and as a result, the bitterling, a cool water fish species, could successfully become dominant. Finally, the deployment of the ADP appears to provide a practical alternative for effective fishery resources management to improve species diversity and fish communities in an artificial freshwater ecosystem (garden pond, park pond, other artificial wetlands, etc.).",,,,,"Joo, Jin Chul/Y-9304-2019; Lee, Saeromi/AAD-7043-2022","Joo, Jin Chul/0000-0001-8551-3945",,,,,,,,,,,,,2073-4441,,,,,JAN,2019,11,1,,,,,,,139,10.3390/w11010139,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11010139,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000459735100137,View Full Record in Web of Science

Microzooplankton grazing rate was overall only weakly correlated with phytoplankton growth rate, although fluctuations in the rates appeared to parallel one another for restricted periods. Grazing was about 73% of growth rate at ambient nutrients during 1995, a year in which the two were correlated. In winter and early spring, phytoplankton growth rates were low and unaffected by nutrient additions. In late spring, stimulation of growth by nutrient addition was more common, but microzooplankton grazing was partially effective in relieving nutrient Limitation. Growth enhancement by nutrient addition was most common in summer, and microzooplankton grazing was less effective at relieving nutrient limitation. For N addition stimulated phytoplankton growth in late spring and autumn, but only N addition stimulated growth in summer. Temperature constrained upper bounds of observed growth rates throughout the year, but many observed growth rates were far below the temperature-dependent maximum, even with nutrients added. Considered as a single group, temperature-normalized growth rates were poorly related to in situ daily photon flux; but the rates appeared to fall into species-dependent higher and lower groups. The higher growth rates were statistically associated with the diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana, Thalassiosira sp., and Nitzschia longissima. The lower growth rates were associated with the dinoflagellates Gyrodinium uncatenum and Prorocentrum minimum.

Results show that average daily gain of feedlot-finished animals (620 g/day) was nearly three-fold higher (P = 0.042) than that of grazed steers (223 g/day). Feedlot-finished steers produced 28 kg (P = 0.001) heavier carcasses than grazed ones. Carcasses from feedlot-finished steers cooled slowly as they had higher (P = 0.001) temperatures than that of grazed ones at 45 min (33.1 vs. 30.5 degrees C) and 6 h (21.0 vs. 19.5 degrees C) post-mortem. Feedlot-finished steers produced beef with higher (P = 0.003) marbling scores (3.4) than grazed ones (2.4). As a result, beef from the feedlot-finished steers was more tender (P = 0.016) than that from grazed ones, and it required 13 N less force to shear. It is concluded that TSHZ responds positively to improved feeding with significant enhancement on carcass gain and meat quality. Use of diets compounded using agro-processing by-products, instead of whole grain, can lower the cost of finishing TSHZ steers significantly.",,,,,,"Mushi, Daniel/0000-0001-6084-7068",,,,,,,,,,,,,0049-4747,1573-7438,,,,NOV,2020,52,6,,,,,3207,3216,,10.1007/s11250-020-02346-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-020-02346-y,,JUL 2020,,,,,,32638154,,,,,WOS:000546207300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its variability on multiple time scales strongly depends on environmental variables such as temperature and moisture. To investigate the temporal variations of R-soil in a cool-temperate oak (Quercus mongolica) forest at the Nam-San site in Seoul, Korea, continuous measurements of R-soil using the automated chamber systems, air and soil temperatures and soil moisture are made for the period from April 2010 to March 2011. The observed data indicate that the R-soil shows a remarkable seasonal variation in accordance with temperatures with high in summer and low in winter. The R-soil is found to be strongly correlated with soil temperature (T-s) at the 5 cm depth throughout the year. However, the high fluctuation of R-soil is found to be related with soil moisture content (M-s) during the forest growing season. The estimated annual Q(10) value using the 1.5 m-high air temperature is found to be 2.4 that is comparable with other studies in temperate forest ecosystems. The optimal regression equation of R-soil with the T-s at 5 cm depth and the M-s at 15 cm depth is found to be R-soil = 124.3 exp (0.097T(s)) - 55.3 (M-s)(2) + 2931.9 (M-s) - 38516 for T-s >= 0 degrees C and R-soil = 0 for T-s<0 degrees C with r(2) = 0.97, P<0.01, suggesting the importance of T-s and M-s for R-soil. The annual total soil respiration estimated by the optimal regression equation is found to be 1264 g C m(-2) with a maximum of 685 g C m(-2) in the summer season and a minimum of 33 g C m(-2) in the winter season.

Energy used for growth and respiration or lost with faeces and excreted ammonia was estimated, along with total energy consumption through food, for six specimens of O. vulgaris (with masses between 114 and 662 g). The energy balance equation was estimated for the specimens at 10-day intervals. During each 10-day interval, food consumed, body mass increase and quantity of faeces voided were measured. The calorific values of octopus flesh, anchovy flesh and faeces were measured by bomb calorimetry. Oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion rates were monitored for each specimen during three 24-h experiments and daily oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion were estimated. It was found that 58% of the energy consumed was used for respiration. The amount of energy invested in somatic and gonadal growth represented 26% of the total energy budget. The energy discarded through faeces was 13% of consumed energy. The estimated assimilation efficiency (AE) values of O. vulgaris feeding on anchovy (80.9-90.7%) were lower than the AE values estimated for other cephalopod species with different diets of lower lipid content such as crabs or mussels. Specific growth rates (SGR) ranged 0.43-0.95 and were similar to those reported for other high-lipid diets (bogue, sardine) and lower than SGR values found for low-lipid, high-protein diets (squid, crab, natural diet).

Experiments were conducted at ambient and twice ambient atmospheric CO2 concentrations at five temperatures. The 1995 temperature in Mississippi was used as a reference with the other temperatures being 1995 minus 2 degrees C, and 1995 plus 2, 5 and 7 degrees C. Daily and seasonal variation and amplitudes were maintained. Seedlings had 4-6 times as much leaf area and dry weight at 20 d after emergence when grown at 28 degrees C as at 23 degrees C (1995 ambient) average temperature during that growth period. Number of days to first square, flower, and open boil decreased as temperature increased. Double atmospheric CO2 did not affect these developmental rates. Temperatures above 28 degrees C, or 1995 average whole-season temperatures, were detrimental to mid-and late-season boil retention and growth. No fruits were retained to maturity at 1995 plus 5 or 7 degrees C. However, whole season vegetative growth was not significantly reduced by temperature 5-7 degrees C above the 1995 ambient conditions. Twice ambient CO2 caused about 40% increase in vegetative dry matter accumulation across temperatures. In a separate experiment, similar results were obtained on fruiting cotton grown at a range of temperatures based on long-term average US Midsouth July temperatures.

By using the satellite ET model, temperature in terms of LST(RS) was directly calculated from brightness temperatures of MODIS channels 31 and 32; while incident solar radiation in terms of APAR(RS) was calculated from NDVI(RS) computed from reflectance of MODIS channels 1 and 2. ET calibrated from the model was experimented to assess sensitivity of ET on rice grown under increased temperature (2 degrees C.) The results showed that modeled ET had a good agreement with Penman-based ET, a typical model widely used for estimating irrigated water supply.

E. H. Walker is an obnoxious weed, emerging as an invasive species globally. Seed germination biology of four populations of the species stemming from arid, semi-arid, temperate, and humid regions was determined in this study. Seed germination was recorded under six different environmental cues (i.e., light/dark periods, constant and alternating day and night temperatures, pH, salinity, and osmotic potential levels) in separate experiment for each cue. Populations were main factor, whereas levels of each environmental cue were considered as sub-factor. The impact of seed burial depths on seedling emergence was inferred in a greenhouse pot experiment. Seed germination was recorded daily and four germination indices, i.e., seed germination percentage, mean germination time, time to reach 50% germination, and mean daily germination were computed. Tested populations and levels of different environmental cues had significant impact on various seed germination indices. Overall, seeds stemming from arid and semi-arid regions had higher seed germination potential under stressful and benign environmental conditions compared to temperate and humid populations. Seed of all populations required a definite light period for germination and 12 hours alternating light and dark period resulted in the highest seed germination. Seed germination of all populations occurred under 5-30 degrees C constant and all tested alternate day and night temperatures. However, the highest seed germination was recorded under 20 degrees C. Seeds of arid and semi-arid populations exhibited higher germination under increased temperature, salinity and osmotic potential levels indicating that maternal environment strongly affected germination traits of the tested populations. The highest seed germination of the tested populations was noted under neutral pH, while higher and lower pH than neutral had negative impact on seed germination. Arid and semi-arid populations exhibited higher seed germination under increased pH compared to temperate and humid populations. Seed burial depth had a significant effect on the seedling emergence of all tested populations. An initial increase was noted in seedling emergence percentage with increasing soil depth. However, a steep decline was recorded after 2 cm seed burial depth. These results indicate that maternal environment strongly mediates germination traits of different populations. Lower emergence from >4 cm seed burial depth warrants that deep burial of seeds and subsequent zero or minimum soil disturbance could aid the management of the species in agricultural habitats.

Seed germination is one of the earliest key events in the plant life cycle. The timing of transition from seed to seedling is an important developmental stage determining the survival of individuals that influences the status of populations and species. Because of wide geographical distribution and occurrence in diverse habitats, wild pea (Pisum sativum subsp. elatius) offers an excellent model to study physical type of seed dormancy in an ecological context. This study addresses the gap in knowledge of association between the seed dormancy, seed properties and environmental factors, experimentally testing oscillating temperature as dormancy release clue. Methods. Seeds of 97 pea accessions were subjected to two germination treatments (oscillating temperatures of 25/15 degrees C and 35/15 degrees C) over 28 days. Germination pattern was described using B-spline coefficients that aggregate both final germination and germination speed. Relationships between germination pattern and environmental conditions at the site of origin (soil and bioclimatic variables extracted from WorldClim 2.0 and SoilGrids databases) were studied using principal component analysis, redundancy analysis and ecological niche modelling. Seeds were analyzed for the seed coat thickness, seed morphology, weight and content of proanthocyanidins (PA). Results. Seed total germination ranged from 0% to 100%. Cluster analysis of germination patterns of seeds under two temperature treatments differentiated the accessions into three groups: (1) non-dormant (28 accessions, mean germination of 92%), (2) dormant at both treatments (29 acc., 15%) and (3) responsive to increasing temperature range (41 acc., with germination change from 15 to 80%). Seed coat thickness differed between groups with dormant and responsive accessions having thicker testa (median 138 and 140 mu m) than non-dormant ones (median 84 mm). The total PA content showed to be higher in the seed coat of dormant (mean 2.18 mg g(-1)) than those of non-dormant (mean 1.77 mg g(-1)) and responsive accessions (mean 1.87 mg g(-1)). Each soil and bioclimatic variable and also germination responsivity (representing synthetic variable characterizing germination pattern of seeds) was spatially clustered. However, only one environmental variable (BIO7, i.e., annual temperature range) was significantly related to germination responsivity. Non-dormant and responsive accessions covered almost whole range of BIO7 while dormant accessions are found in the environment with higher annual temperature, smaller temperature variation, seasonality and milder winter. Ecological niche modelling showed a more localized potential distribution of dormant group. Seed dormancy in the wild pea might be part of a bet-hedging mechanism for areas of the Mediterranean basin with more unpredictable water availability in an otherwise seasonal environment.

The aim of this experiment was to assess the usefulness of sap flow and canopy temperature (T-c) measurements, as plant water stress indicators in citrus trees compared with more classical methods like psi(s) or g(s). The experiment was performed during the summer of 2011 in a Clementina de Nules orchard undergoing RDI. Sap flow was determined by means of the compensated heat pulse method in well-watered and RDI trees. T-c was measured continuously with infrared thermometers (IRTs) mounted over the canopies pointing vertically downward but also weekly with an infrared hand-operated thermographic camera taking frontal images of the sunlit side of the crowns. Concurrently, psi(s) and g(s) were also measured on all the trees. Results showed that the evolution of relative transpiration, obtained with the sap flow gauges, was in agreement with the water deficit applied. The values of T-c obtained with the IRTs normalized by air temperature (e.g., T-c - T-a) were in general poorly related with psi(s) and g(s). However, when T-c was obtained from thermal imaging there was a good correlation with psi(s) in days of relatively high stress (i.e., when psi(s) differences among treatments were > 1.0 MPa). psi(s), g(s) and T-c obtained from thermal images were significantly correlated with the average fruit weight at harvest. The best correlation was that of thermographic T-c followed by psi(s) and g(s). Overall, results showed that both sap flow and T-c measurements can detect plant water stress in cases of severely stressed citrus trees. The determination of T-c from thermal imaging, which integrates a large number of leaves in the measurement, was better than the IRTs method for detecting plant water stress.",,,,,"Ballester-Lurbe, Carlos/AAX-2157-2021; Bello, Miguel Angel Jimenez/B-8630-2016","Ballester-Lurbe, Carlos/0000-0002-6885-0883; Bello, Miguel Angel Jimenez/0000-0003-1057-3331",,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,978-94-62610-26-2,,,,2014,1038,,,,,,51,57,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1038.4,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1038.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000343887500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mouse lemurs slept most often in tree forks and tangles of vegetation and preferred sleeping sites in Alluaudia spp. (36%) and Euphorbia spp. (30%), 2 very common tree genera in the spiny forest. Sleeping associations allowed the animals to use larger and more extensively overlapping home ranges and to have access to more food. Predation risk was much higher during nocturnal activity than during diurnal rest. Sleeping groups were small, usually pairs. Animals showed no signs of vigilance in sleeping sites and did not huddle consistently. Sleeping sites were chosen for their inaccessibility to predators and were well buffered against high and low ambient temperatures. Therefore, sleeping association was better explained by social territoriality than by predation pressure or thermoregulation.

Consistent snow cover insulated the soil surface from extreme air temperatures and allowed heterotrophic activity to continue through much of the winter. In contrast, soil remained frozen at sites with inconsistent snow cover and production did not begin until snowmelt. Fluxes were measured when soil temperatures under the snow ranged from -5 degrees C to 0 degrees C, but there was no significant relationship between flux for either gas and temperature within this range. While early developing snowpacks resulted in warmer minimum soil temperatures allowing production to continue for most of the winter, the highest CO2 fluxes were recorded at sites which experienced a hard freeze before a consistent snowpack developed. Consequently, the seasonal flux of CO2-C from snow covered soils was related both to the severity of freeze and the duration of snow cover. Over-winter CO2-C loss ranged from 0.3 g C m(-2) season(-1) at sites characterized by inconsistent snow cover to 25.7 g C m(-2) season(-1) at sites that experienced a hard freeze followed by an extended period of snow cover. In contrast to the pattern observed with C loss, a hard freeze early in the winter did not result in greater N2O-N loss. Both mean daily N2O fluxes and the total over-winter N2O-N loss were related to the length of time soils were covered by a consistent snowpack. Over-winter N2O-N loss ranged from less 0.23 mg N m(-2) from the latest developing, short duration snowpacks to 16.90 mg N m(-2) from sites with early snow cover. These data suggest that over-winter heterotrophic activity in snow-covered soil has the potential to mineralize from less than 1% to greater than 25% of the carbon fixed in ANPP, while over-winter N2O fluxes range from less than half to an order of magnitude higher than growing season fluxes. The variability in these fluxes suggests that small changes in climate which affect the timing of seasonal snow cover may have a large effect on C and N cycling in these environments.",,,,,"Schmidt, Steven K/G-2771-2010","Schmidt, Steven K/0000-0002-9175-2085; Brooks, Paul/0000-0001-9201-1062",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,APR,1997,110,3,,,,,403,413,,10.1007/s004420050175,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050175,,,,,,,,28307230,,,,,WOS:A1997WX37000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, a two-year field experiment was carried out in the Hotan and Shihezi areas to measure photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on the space-time scale, air temperature on the time scale, wind speed and windproof efficiency on the time scale, and yield and income. Through correlation analysis, the relationship between intercropping microclimate and intercropping yield were revealed. Compared with corresponding sole cropping cotton, the PAR of intercropping in Hotan and Shihezi was 13.04% and 12.75% lower, respectively, and the closer to the tree alley, the smaller it was. Intercropping changed the daily dynamics of air temperature, especially at high temperatures, under which the decrease range was significant. Intercropping has buffer effect and latent heat release on air temperature and the maximum temperature in Hotan and Shihezi intercropping was 13.57% and 6.49 lower than that in sole-cropping, respectively. Intercropping reduced the wind speed, the greater the wind speed in a certain range, the stronger the windproof efficiency. The maximum windproof efficiency of Hotan intercropping was 50.92%, and that of Shihezi was 48.56%. The intercropping system had advantages in land equivalent ratio (LER), yield, and income. The income of intercropping was 11622.38-12528.55 USD.hm(-2), 55.41-61.91% higher than that of sole-cropping cotton and 19.19-20.37% higher than that of sole-cropping jujube.

Viability of the seeds was greater than 50% after 26 months of burial in the soil indicating the potential build-up of a substantial persistent soil seed bank. A short period of dry storage was sufficient to overcome a light requirement for germination in a minor fraction of the seeds. Likewise, seeds exhumed from burial showed an increase in germination ability in darkness over time, with a weak tendency for seasonal cyclicity in dormancy level at one of two sites. Germination occurred at the mean minimum (10degreesC) and maximum (25degreesC) temperatures of the collection sites, as well as over a wide range of fluctuating (12/2degreesC-35/25degreesC) temperatures in light. No germination of R hysterophorus seeds occurred at osmotic potentials < -0.52 MPa (at 27 degrees C), the species being less tolerant to moisture stress than sorghum grains. Most seedlings emerged from shallowly buried (< 0.5 cm) seeds and none from more than 5 cm depth. Naturally dispersed seeds required about 60 days, at a hot lowland site, to start emergence despite the presence of adequate rainfall, and higher number of seedlings emerged in undisturbed plots than in hand hoed plots. These experiments and field observations suggest that there are no obvious climatic conditions that may limit the germination of Parthenium hysterophorus in Ethiopia, but a high moisture requirement of the seeds for germination could be the major factor limiting germination during the dry season.",,,,,"Milberg, Per/G-6153-2012; Per, Milberg/C-2618-2009","Milberg, Per/0000-0001-6128-1051; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-4746,1744-7348,,,,,2002,140,3,,,,,263,270,,10.1111/j.1744-7348.2002.tb00180.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2002.tb00180.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000177249800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We assessed whether complete feed restriction prior to (24 degrees C, days 0-23) and/or during (14 degrees C, days 24-114) a simulated period of cold-acclimation could elicit episodes of compensatory growth (CG) and catch-up growth upon warm-up to 24 degrees C and satiation feeding (days 115-148). Control hybrid striped bass (HSB: Morone chrysops Chi Morone saxatilis) were fed to satiation throughout the entire experiment under these temperature fluctuations. Compensatory growth and ultimately catch-up growth were achieved in groups of HSB that were deprived of feed during either the initial period at 24 degrees C (days 0-23), during the cold-acclimation period (14 degrees C, days 24-114), or during both of these periods (days 0-114). Further, it appears that HSB are better able to compensate for weight loss when skeletal length is not significantly compromised during the treatment period, which occurred in HSB feed restricted during cold-acclimation only. The most dramatic CG responses were defined by specific growth rates (SGRs) up to 4.2 times that of controls and were accompanied by hyperphagia and improvements in temporal and overall feed conversion. Levels of plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and muscle IGF-1 mRNA were significantly correlated to growth rate for all groups throughout the experiment (R-2 = 0.40, 0.23, respectively), with an overcompensation of both observed in HSB with the most elevated SGRs during the CG response. Interestingly, opposing trends were observed between muscle mRNA expression of growth hormone receptor (GHR)-1 and -2, with fasting at 24 degrees C and 14 degrees C resulting in depressed levels of GHR-1 and elevated levels of GHR-2 relative to controls. Levels of muscle myostatin (MSTN)-1 mRNA were significantly depressed in HSB fasted at 24 degrees C and/or 14 degrees C while MSTN-2 mRNA was lower following initial feed restriction at 24 degrees C. Likewise, levels of unprocessed pro-MSTN (precursor) and mature MSTN protein were both depressed in fasted fish at 24 degrees C. This study demonstrates that a previous period of feed restriction and cold-acclimation followed by realimentation at more favorable water temperatures produces a strong CG response and catch-up growth in fish. These studies also suggest that an overcompensation of circulating and local IGF-1 along with changes in MSTN mRNA and protein expression may contribute to accelerated growth rates characteristic of CG. Furthermore, our studies indicate that overall feed conversion can improve by as much as 30% with CG induced through temperature and feeding manipulations with no adverse effects on growth of HSB. This raises the possibility that CG protocols can improve production efficiency of HSB and other temperate teleosts in pond or tank culture. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

The present study was directed to assess the on-farm water requirement in wheat crop in future, in semi-arid Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, through field and computer simulations. Field simulation using temperature gradient tunnels shows 18% higher crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and 17% increase in root water extraction at 3.6 degrees C elevated temperature compared to 1.5 degrees C increase over the ambient. A time series model (ARIMA) with long-term (1984-2010) weather data of the experimental site and a global climate model (IPCC-SRES HADCM3) were used to simulate the potential ET (ET0) of wheat for 2020-2021 and 2050-2051 years. The crop coefficient (K-c) values for these years were generated through K-c-CGDD (Cumulative growing-degree-days) relation by using LARS-WG model-derived daily minimum and maximum temperatures. The CWR and NIR (Net Irrigation Requirement) are likely to be less in projected years even though air temperatures increase. The CWR reduces in ARIMA outputs owing to a lower reference ET (ET0) due to decline in solar radiation. Under IPCC-SRES scenarios, the ETc-crop phenophase relation [CGDD-LGP (length of growing period) response] may offset the effect of rising temperature and a net decline in CWR is observed. It may be likely that the effect of temperature increase on CWR is manifested mostly through its relation with crop phenophase (thermal requirement to complete a specific growth stage) and not the temperature effect on ET0 per se. This is certainly a ray of hope in managing the depleting irrigation water resources in the semi-arid wheat-growing regions of the IGP. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Quantification of the clinical disease can be done by determining a number of variables, derived from parasitological, haematological and rectal temperature measurements as described by Rowlands et al. (2000). From a total of 13 parameters a single ECF-score is calculated that allows categorization of infected cattle in five different classes that correlate with the severity of clinical signs. This score is complicated not only by the fact that it requires estimation of 13 parameters but also because of the subsequent mathematics. The fact that the values are normalised over a range of 0-10 for each experiment makes it impossible to compare results from different experiments. Here we present an alternative score based on the packed cell volume and the number of piroplasms in the circulation and that is calculated using a simple equation; ECF-score = PCV(rel day 0)/log(PE + 10). In this equation the packed cell volume is expressed as a value relative to that of the day on infection (PCV(rel day 0)) and the number of piroplasms is expressed as the logarithmic value of the number of infected red blood cells (=PE) in a total of 1000 red blood cells. To allow PE to be 0, +10 is added in the denominator. We analysed a data set of 54 cattle from a previous experiment and found a statistically significant linear correlation between the ECF-score value reached during the post-infection period and the Rowlands' score value. The new score is much more practical than the Rowlands score as it only requires daily blood sampling. From these blood samples both PCV and number of piroplasms can be determined, and the score can be calculated daily. This allows monitoring the development of ECF after infection, which was hitherto not possible. In addition, the new score allows for easy comparison of results from different experiments.

Flow fluctuations due to load-following have the potential to increase the energy used by juvenile white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus that move to avoid unfavorable habitat or that alter swimming speed to maintain position over a range of velocities. Following laboratory respirometry experiments, a field study using eiectromyogram (EMG) and sonic telemetry was conducted to determine whether movement (area and distance), swimming speed, or oxygen consumption of juvenile white sturgeon responded to the operation of Hells Canyon Dam during three study periods when flows were artificially fluctuated to resemble extreme load-following operation (192-836 m(3)/s), held high and stable (442-629 m(3)/s), or held low and stable (275-284 m(3)/s). Respirometry results confirmed that the oxygen consumption of juvenile white sturgeon increased with swimming speed, was temperature dependent, and when corrected for fish mass, ranged from 140.2 to 306.5 mg O-2. kg(-1) (.) h(-1). The telemetry study showed that the distance sturgeon moved and the area used were similar at all flows. However, when flows were held low and stable, swimming speed and oxygen consumption decreased compared with the other study periods. Although the overall trend was for swimming speed and oxygen consumption to be less during the study period when flows were low and stable, the differences between study periods appeared to be due to differences in water temperature and light levels, which changed during the investigation. The results suggest that high flows, even those of relatively short duration such as occur during load-following operations, restrict the movement of juvenile white sturgeon. However, high flows do not result in an increase of energy expenditure, possibly because of morphological and behavioral adaptations to living in a high-velocity environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,JUL,2005,134,4,,,,,803,816,,10.1577/T04-108.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T04-108.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000230411700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

A process-based understanding of environmental controls on CWD CO2 flux (R-CWD) is needed to accurately model carbon exchange between forests and the atmosphere. The objectives of this study were to: (1) use a laboratory incubation factorial experiment to quantify the effect of temperature (T-CWD), water content (W-C), decay status, and their interactions on R-CWD for black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP] CWD; (2) measure and model spatial and temporal dynamics in T-CWD for a boreal black spruce fire chronosequence; and (3) validate the R-CWD model with field measurements, and quantify potential errors in estimating annual R-CWD from this model on various time steps. The R-CWD was positively correlated to T-CWD (R-2=0.37, P<0.001) and W-C (R-2=0.18, P<0.001), and an empirical RCWD polynomial model that included T-CWD and W-C interactions explained 74% of the observed variation of R-CWD. The R-CWD estimates from the R-CWD model excellently matched the field measurements. Decay status of CWD significantly (P<0.001) affected R-CWD. The temperature coefficient (Q(10)) averaged 2.5, but varied by 141% across the 5-42degreesC temperature range, illustrating the potential shortcomings of using a constant Q(10). The CWD temperature was positively correlated to air temperature (R-2=0.79, P<0.001), with a hysteresis effect that was correlated to CWD decay status and stand leaf area index. Ignoring this temperature hysteresis introduced errors of -1% to +32% in annual R-CWD estimates.

Due to lack of field data, efforts to quantify crop yield potential typically rely on crop models. Using the ORYZA rice crop model, we sought to estimate Yp of irrigated rice for two widely used rice varieties (M-206 and CXL745) in three major US rice-producing regions that together represent some of the highest yielding rice regions of the world. Three major issues with the crop model had to be addressed to achieve acceptable simulation of Yp; first, the model simulated leaf area index (LAI) and biomass agreed poorly for all direct-seeded systems using default settings; second, cold-induced sterility and associated yield losses were poorly simulated for environments with a large diurnal temperature variation; lastly, simulated Yp was sensitive to the specified definition of physiological maturity. Except for the simulation of cold-induced sterility, all issues could be remedied within the existing model structure. In contrast, simulation of cold-induced sterility posed a continuing challenge to accurate simulation one that will likely require changes to ORYZA's formulation. Estimates of Yp from the modified model were validated against large multi-year data sets of experimental yields covering the majority of US rice production areas. Validation showed the adjusted model simulated Yp well, with most top yields falling within 85% of Yp for both varieties (77% and 78% observed yields within 15% of Yp for CXL745 and M-206 respectively). Maximum estimated Yp was 14.3 (range of 8.2-14.5) and 14.5 (range of 8.7-15.3) t ha(-1) for the Southern US and CA, respectively. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Accuracy of cumulative consumption predictions was also tested for one of the models. Consumption-dependent prediction error has been commonly observed in bioenergetics models for other fish species; model errors for predicting relative growth rate of individual fish were regressed on observed mean daily consumption rate to assess whether the two bioenergetics models exhibited this type of error. Both models yielded unbiased estimates of brown trout growth that were within 1-12% of observed values across the range of fish sizes, water temperatures, and ration levels tested. For regressions of predicted versus observed final weight, the Bonferroni joint 95% confidence intervals for slope included 1 and confidence intervals for the y-intercept included 0 for both models. No significant intermodel differences in percent error for predicting final weight of fish in feeding trials were observed. Predicted cumulative consumption values were within 8-15% of corresponding observed values. Neither model exhibited significant consumption-dependent error for predicting brown trout growth, in contrast to results of several previous laboratory evaluations of bioenergetics models for other fish species. Absence of consumption-dependent error in the two brown trout models may be a result of (1) incorporating feeding rate dependence of egestion and excretion into these models and (2) using egestion and excretion parameters that were not borrowed from other species. Results of this evaluation corroborate the utility of these bioenergetics models for predicting growth and consumption for brown trout under the range of fish sizes, water temperatures, and ration levels tested.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,JUL,2010,139,4,,,,,929,936,,10.1577/T09-177.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T09-177.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000279879700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Plants were grown hydroponically, and then transferred to temperature controlled (25-degrees-C) root cuvettes for nutrient uptake determinations. Uptake solutions provided NH4+ and NO3- simultaneously (both) or separately (single). In the firSt experiment, seven species of Piper, from a broad range of rainforest light habitats ranging from gap to understory, were screened for mineral nitrogen preference (100 muM NH4+ and/or 100 muM NO3-) at intermediate PFD (100 mumol m-2 s-1). Preference for NH4+ relative to NO3-, defined as the ratio of NH4+ (both):NO3- (both) net uptake, was higher in understory species than in gap species. Ammonium repression of NO3- uptake, defined as the ratio of NO3- (single): NO3- (both) net uptake, was also higher in understory species as compared to gap species. In a second set of experiments, we examined the effect of nitrogen concentration (equimolar, 10 to 1000 muM) on NH4+ preference and NH4+ repression of NO3- net uptake at high (500 mumol m-2 s-1) and low (50 mumol m-2 s-1) PFD in a gap (P. auritum), generalist (P. hispidum) and understory species (P. aequale).

In recent years, winter temperature has dropped in these regions, and extremely low temperatures are hard to survive for insects. Cold hardiness becomes a crucial strategy because temperature change often leads to fluctuations in insect abundance, and the metabolism rate is a key index of resistance to cold in overwintering insects. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the change in respiratory rate and the activity of metabolism-related mitochondrial enzymes in D. armandi larvae under cold conditions. We found that the respiratory rate decreased, and it was matched with the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase, aconitase, and lipase during overwintering. Among the various test times under cold conditions, the respiratory rate also decreased with decreasing temperature and increased under very low temperatures. At all cold stress periods, glutamate dehydrogenase and lipase showed increased activity at higher temperatures and decreased activity under lower temperatures, but the activity of NAD-malic enzyme, NADP-malic enzyme, mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase, and aconitase were contrary. Under all low temperatures, the activity of enzymes - except for NADP-malic enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase, and lipase - increased in short-term cold stress and decreased in long-term cold stress at 4, 0, -4, -6, -8, and -10 degrees C. However, at -2 degrees C, the activity of enzymes showed a decreasing trend in short-term treatments and an increasing trend in long-term treatments, except for mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase.

Graft-inoculated potted plants were used to assess Las speed of movement in phloem in the greenhouse, and the impacts of temperature on plant colonization in growth-chamber experiments. For assessment of Las speed, plants were inoculated at the main stem and assessed over time by quantitative PCR (qPCR) or symptoms at various distances from the inoculum. For colonization, the plants were inoculated in one of two opposite top branches, maintained at from 8 to 20 degrees C, from 18 to 30 degrees C, or from 24 to 38 degrees C daily range, and assessed by qPCR of samples taken from noninoculated shoots. For all experiments, frequencies of Las-positive sites were submitted to analysis of variance and binomial generalized linear model and logistic regression analyses. Probabilities of detecting Las in greenhouse plants were functions of time and distance from the inoculation site, which resulted in 2.9 and 3.8 cm day(-1) average speed of movement. In growth chambers, the temperature impacted plant colonization by Las, new shoot emission, and symptom expression. After a 7-month exposure time, Las was absent in all new shoots in the cooler environment (average three per plant), and present in 70% at the milder environment (six shoots, severe symptoms) and 25% in the warmer environment (eight shoots, no visible symptoms).

For instance, species that employ physical dormancy (PY) - the production of seeds that are impermeable to water until high temperatures break them, consequently synchronizing germination with favorable growing conditions - may find that their seeds germinate during unfavorable or potentially fatal periods if threshold temperatures are reached earlier in the year. To explore this, we subjected the seeds of five species with physical dormancy (from the genera Abrus, Bauhinia, Cassia, Albizia, and Acacia) to mild (+2 degrees C) and extreme (+4 degrees C) future warming scenarios and documented their germination over 2 years relative to a control treatment. Under current climatic conditions, a proportion of seeds from all five species remained dormant in the soil for 2 years. A mild warming of 2 degrees C had little to no effect on the germination of four of the five study species. Contrastingly, an extreme warming of 4 degrees C dramatically increased germination in all five species within the first year, indicating a reduction in their ability to persist in the soil long-term. Cassia fistula was particularly susceptible to warming, exhibiting a similar increase in germination under both mild and extreme warming relative to control. Our findings suggest that climate warming in the tropics may cause the seeds of species that rely on physical dormancy to stagger the risk of unsuccessful germination across years to leave soil seed banks prematurely - the long-term implications of which remain unknown.",,,,,,"Biddick, Matthew/0000-0002-1196-5698",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-462X,,,,,DEC 15,2021,12,,,,,,,,782706,10.3389/fpls.2021.782706,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.782706,,,,,,,,34975968,,,,,WOS:000738359400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we present net ecosystem flux measurements of methyl halides from a brackish tidal marsh on the west coast of the United States between April 2016 and June 2017 using the relaxed eddy accumulation method. The measurement footprint encompasses a large part of the studied tidal marsh, including roughly 20 vascular plant species, open water, and soil surfaces. On the annual scale, ecosystem methyl halide emissions showed the strongest relationships to temperature and the growth cycle of halophyte vegetation, whereas on diurnal time scales, fluxes correlated the most with evapotranspiration. The maximum seasonal emissions occurred during the flowering season of Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed), one of the most abundant halophytes on site. The maximum hourly emissions of 111 mu g CH3Cl.m(-2)s.hr(-1) and 38 mu g CH3Br.m(-2).hr(-1) were observed during a heat wave in early June. Annually integrated emissions were 135 mg/m(2) for CH3Cl and 21 mg/m(2) for CH3Br, scaling up to 621 and 96 kg over the entire marsh.

However, little is known about the differences between plant tissues in terms of glycerolipid response to low temperatures. Using lipidomics-based ESI-MS/MS coupled with statistical analysis, we compared the glycerolipidome of barley plants grown at 25 degrees C with that of plants exposed to chilling temperature (4 degrees C). We found that the level of phospholipids and galactolipids was higher in roots than in leaves, although the phospholipid to galactolipids ratio was similar for both tissues. Compared with plants grown at 25 degrees C, the chilling treatment produced contrasting responses in phospholipids and galactolipids. A slight increasing trend in unsaturated fatty acid-enriched phospholipids can be observed in leaves during short-term chilling. By contrast, there is a decrease in plastidic and extraplastidic phospholipids in roots during long-term chilling.

The biological and climatic inputs to the model were the thermal requirements for the stages of crop growth, leaf number, leaf area, harvest index, the daily maximum and minimum air temperature, precipitation and solar radiation. These values were obtained from a daily meteorological database for ninety-three sites in England and Wales for the period 1951-80.

The purpose was to test a sensor system for spatio-temporal variations in temperature across the snow-air interface and snow accumulation/ablation, which includes atmospheric net balance and migrating snow dunes. In the dry snow conditions, environmental static electricity interfered with data transfer; several sensors were disabled early, while the longest record reached 6 months. Along the main transect, the year 2000 mass balance ranged from 52 to 221 mm w.e., largely following spatial patterns seen by other researchers. The level increased toward the edge of the ice sheet; unloading of drifting snow as the slope flattens, rather than increased snowfall as previously thought, may be responsible for this. At the Hogisen ice dome site the mass balance was 897 mm w.e., possibly due to unloading of wind-blown snow, as katabatic winds are locally forced uphill. This mechanism is important to maintain such topographic features along the Antarctic ice sheet margin. Major precipitation events occurred at 3-5 week intervals and much of the precipitation fell before mid-June.

The literature on this topic was analyzed in order to summarize the results of past research and to identify the gaps that still exist on the matter. We reviewed a total of 27 papers focusing on the movement ecology of white seabream, where acoustic telemetry (n = 12), underwater visual observation and traditional tagging (n = 6), genetic analysis (n = 6), and otolith microchemistry (n = 3) were used.

The environmental variables found to affect movement patterns in this species are water temperature (which triggers spawning-based vertical movements), local sea conditions (which affect short-scale movements in juveniles), and the main seabed features (orientation and habitat type).

As cooling increased production costs, this experiment aimed to study the growth of various Lactuca genotypes and propose possible ways of reducing these costs, without compromising productivity. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) of lettuce and its parental lines (L. serriola and L. sativa Salinas) were grown aeroponically in a tropical greenhouse under 24 degrees C cool (C) or warm fluctuating 30-36 degrees C ambient (A) rootzone temperature (RZT). Their roots were misted with Netherlands standard nutrient solution for 1 min, at intervals of either 5 min (A5, C5) or 10 min (A10, C10) in attempting to reduce electricity consumption and production costs. Lower mortality and higher productivity were observed in all genotypes when grown in C-RZT. Higher shoot fresh weight was observed under C5 than C10, for the RIL and L. serriola. Since Salinas had similar shoot fresh weight at both C-RZ treatments, this may indicate it is more sensitive to RZT than water availability. Under A-RZ treatments, higher carotenoid content, with correspondingly higher nonphotochemical quenching, was observed in A10 for the RIL and Salinas. Further, total chlorophyll content was also highest at this RZ treatment for the RIL though photochemical quenching was contrastingly the lowest. Cumulatively, productivity was compromised at A10 as the RIL seemed to prioritize photoprotection over efficiency in photosynthesis, under conditions of higher RZT and lower water availability. Generally, higher RZ ethylene concentrations accumulated in A10 and C10 than A5 and C5, respectively-probably due to spray frequency exerting a greater effect on RZ ethylene accumulation than RZT. In the C5 RZ treatment, lowest RZ ethylene concentration corresponded with highest shoot fresh weight. As such, further research on ethylene (in)sensitivity and water use efficiency could be conducted to identify Lactuca cultivars that are better suited for growth in the tropics, so as to allay production costs with reduced cooling and spray intervals.",,,,,"He, jie/AAB-1279-2020","Dodd, Ian Charles/0000-0003-2725-859X; He, Jie/0000-0002-7398-697X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-042X,,,,,SEP 13,2016,7,,,,,,,,405,10.3389/fphys.2016.00405,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2016.00405,,,,,,,,27679582,,,,,WOS:000382924900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This results in the persistence of a constant otolith-size/fish-size relationship. In the present study, the response of otolith growth to laboratory-induced changes in body growth was determined over a 10-day period in December 1985. Juveniles were subjected to two ranges of temperature (19-21-degrees-C and 24-26-degrees-C) and three feeding levels (fully fed, partially fed, and starved) of a diet consisting of larvae of Opifex fuscus, an endemic mosquito. Fish were individually tagged to ensure that changes in growth rate and any associated changes in otolith microstructure could be accurately determined for any individual. Fully fed fish grew more slowly during treatment than they did prior to treatment, and starved fish did not grow at all. Partially fed fish exhibited a size-hierarchy effect, with larger fish increasing in body size at the expense of smaller individuals. No temperature effect on growth rate was recorded. In contrast to the results from an associated field study, otoliths of fully fed fish continued to increase at the same daily width despite the induced alteration in growth rate. Thus, otoliths were disproportionately large compared with estimates from the field. However, otoliths of starved fish were not as large as predicted from a continual production of daily rings at a constant width. Daily ring deposition may have ceased at different times during the experiment for the starved fish, depending on body size. Alternatively, deposition may have continued, but at a spacing that was not detectable by light microscopy. We conclude that adequate validation of response of otolith growth to changes in somatic growth is necessary before individual growth histories can be back-calculated. This is true even where strong evidence from the field suggests that back-calculation is possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0067-1940,,,,,,1992,43,5,,,,,1203,1214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992KU72900022,View Full Record in Web of Science

To experimentally quantify the gas transfer velocity in a wide range of aquatic settings, a novel method based on recently developed techniques for the in situ, near-continuous measurement of dissolved (noble) gases with a field portable mass spectrometer is presented. Variations in observed dissolved gas concentrations are damped and lagged with respect to equilibrium concentrations, being the result of (a) temperature (and thus solubility) variations, (b) water depth, and (c) the specific gas transfer velocity (k(i)). The method fits a model to the measured gas concentrations to derive the gas transfer velocity from the amplitude and the phase lag between observed and equilibrium concentrations. With the current experimental setup, the method is sensitive to gas transfer velocities of 0.05-9 m/day (for N-2), at a water depth of 1 m, and a given daily water temperature variation of 10 degrees C.

Two control methods were adopted to control the system running and air outlet temperature, contrastively. The first method is that the running frequency in heating mode is adjusted in terms of the ordinary control method of VRF, i.e., constant condensation temperature. The experiment demonstrates the control method is not feasible. For nominal heating under different static pressure and defrosting under 200 Pa static pressure, the system fluctuates frequently. And for high temperature heating, the air outlet temperature far exceeds the target temperature. Furthermore, the control model of variable condensation temperature target has been presented, and the heat transfer correction factor is introduced into the control model. And the control parameters in the model are determined by experiment. The control model is universal for FAPs with different capacities by identifying and choosing the heat transfer correction factor in the control program. For low temperature heating, the method of switching rotation speed of the motor can be adopted to enhance air outlet temperature to 22 degrees C.

This issue is addressed here by developing and testing the soil (heat-moisture-vapor) HMV-model, a 1-D (one-dimensional) non-equilibrium (liquid-vapor phase change) model of soil evaporation that simulates the coupled simultaneous transport of heat, soil moisture, and water vapor. This model is intended for use with surface forcing ranging from daily solar cycles to extreme conditions encountered during fires. It employs a linearized Crank-Nicolson scheme for the conservation equations of energy and mass and its performance is evaluated against dynamic soil temperature and moisture observations, which were obtained during laboratory experiments on soil samples exposed to surface heat fluxes ranging between 10 000 and 50 000 W m(-2). The Hertz-Knudsen equation is the basis for constructing the model's non-equilibrium evaporative source term. Some unusual aspects of the model that were found to be extremely important to the model's performance include (1) a dynamic (temperature and moisture potential dependent) condensation coefficient associated with the evaporative source term, (2) an infrared radiation component to the soil's thermal conductivity, and (3) a dynamic residual soil moisture. This last term, which is parameterized as a function of temperature and soil water potential, is incorporated into the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity functions in order to improve the model's ability to capture the evaporative dynamics of the strongly bound soil moisture, which requires temperatures well beyond 150 degrees C to fully evaporate. The model also includes film flow, although this phenomenon did not contribute much to the model's overall performance. In general, the model simulates the laboratory-observed temperature dynamics quite well, but is less precise (but still good) at capturing the moisture dynamics. The model emulates the observed increase in soil moisture ahead of the drying front and the hiatus in the soil temperature rise during the strongly evaporative stage of drying. It also captures the observed rapid evaporation of soil moisture that occurs at relatively low temperatures (50-90 degrees C), and can provide quite accurate predictions of the total amount of soil moisture evaporated during the laboratory experiments. The model's solution for water vapor density (and vapor pressure), which can exceed 1 standard atmosphere, cannot be experimentally verified, but they are supported by results from (earlier and very different) models developed for somewhat different purposes and for different porous media. Overall, this non-equilibrium model provides a much more physically realistic simulation over a previous equilibrium model developed for the same purpose. Current model performance strongly suggests that it is now ready for testing under field conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1991-959X,1991-9603,,,,,2015,8,11,,,,,3659,3680,,10.5194/gmd-8-3659-2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-3659-2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000365980100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

A better understanding of seedling recruitment patterns at the field level is required to optimize the timing and efficacy of control measures. Therefore, a population-based threshold model was developed for optimizing germination prediction in multiple acetolactate synthase (ALS)-R and ALS-susceptible (ALS-S) C. difformis biotypes and applied to field-level emergence predictions. Estimated base temperatures (T-b) ranged from 16.5 to 17.6 C with no clear pattern between biotypes; such values are higher than T-b values of other important rice weeds, as well as for rice. Germination rates increased linearly from 16 to 33.7 C. ALS-R seeds germinate faster due to smaller median thermal times to germination (theta(T(50))) while also displaying lower germination synchronicity across water potentials. Interestingly, ALS-R biotypes were capable of germinating under lower moisture availability, as indicated by their lower (more negative) base water potential values (psi(b(50))) for seed germination; psi(b(50)) values ranged from -0.24 to -1.13 MPa. In-field soil germination measurements found thermal times to emergence varied across three water regimes (daily water, flooded, or saturated). Seedling emergence under the daily water treatment was fastest; however, total seedling density was lower than for the other water regimes. In order to optimize springtime C. difformis seedling emergence, soil moisture should be kept around field capacity, as germination is hindered at lower moisture contents. By predicting when most of the seed population germinates, the thermal-time model can address issues regarding the optimal timing for herbicide applications, thereby allowing for improved C. difformis management in rice fields.",,,,,"Neto, Durval Dourado/H-1427-2012","Neto, Durval Dourado/0000-0002-8452-8288; M Pedroso, Rafael/0000-0002-7611-6750",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1745,1550-2759,,,,JAN,2020,68,1,,,,,51,62,PII S0043174519000572,10.1017/wsc.2019.57,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wsc.2019.57,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000509721800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

A close-up thermal approach,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the present scenario of climatic change, climatic refugia will be of paramount importance for species persistence. Topography can generate a considerable climatic heterogeneity over short distances, which is often disregarded in macroclimatic predictive models. Here we investigate the role of rocky habitats as microclimatic refugia by combining two different analyses: exploring a thermal mechanism whereby rocky habitats might serve as refugia, and examining if the biogeographic pattern shows a high abundance of relict, endemic and peripheral species. The thermal profile of two populations of relict and endemic plant species occurring in Pyrenean cliffs was investigated by infrared images and in situ temperature data-loggers. Despite occurring in crevices of a south oriented slope, Androsace cylindrica showed a narrower daily range of temperature than the surrounding matrix, thereby avoiding extreme high temperatures. Borderea chouardii, of tropical ancestors, also occurred in patches where temperatures were buffered during the growth season, experiencing lower mean temperatures than the surrounding matrix and nearby areas during the warmer part of the day, and similar temperatures during the colder. The rocky habitats of both species, therefore, reduced temperature ranges and exposition to extreme climatic events. Compared to other habitats, the rocky ones also harboured a very high fraction of both endemics and peripheral plant populations according to the largest vegetation dataset available in the Pyrenees (18,800 plant inventories and 400,000 records). Our results suggest an association between the habitats of relicts, endemics and species at their distribution limit, driven by a stabilizing effect of rocky habitats on extreme temperatures. Given the important role of rocky habitats as hotspots of singular and unique plants, their characterization seems a sensible first step to identify potential refugia in the context of climate change.",,,,,"Pizarro, Manuel/AAC-5597-2021; Domingo, Darío/N-6323-2017; Garcia, Maria Begoña/B-6630-2015","Pizarro, Manuel/0000-0002-6981-0154; Domingo, Darío/0000-0002-8362-7559; Garcia, Maria Begoña/0000-0003-4231-6006; Font, Xavier/0000-0002-7253-8905",,,,,,,,,,,,,0098-8472,1873-7307,,,,FEB,2020,170,,,,SI,,,,103886,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.103886,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.103886,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000510958900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the drivers of stream metabolism, especially those acting at broad spatial scales, are still not well understood. Moreover, stream metabolism can be affected by hydrological changes associated with seasonality, and thus, assessing the temporality of metabolic rates is a key question to understand stream function. This study aims to analyse the geographical and temporal patterns in stream metabolism and to identify the main drivers regulating the whole ecosystem metabolic rates at local and regional scales. Using a coordinated distributed experiment, we studied ten headwaters streams located across five European ecoregions during summer and fall 2014. We characterized the magnitude and variability of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) with the open-channel method. Moreover, we examined several climatic, geographical, hydrological, morphological, and physicochemical variables that can potentially control stream metabolic rates. Daily rates of stream metabolism varied considerately across streams, with GPP and ER ranging from 0.06 to 4.33 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) and from 0.72 to 14.20 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1), respectively. All streams were highly heterotrophic (P/R < 1), except the southernmost one. We found that the drier climates tended to have the highest GPP, while humid regions presented the highest ER. Between the sampling periods no statistical differences were found. Partial-least squares models (PLS) explained similar to 80% of the variance in GPP and ER rates across headwater streams and included both local and regional variables.

Bud phenology is a trait, which is highly sensitive to environmental fluctuations and thus useful for climate change investigations. However, experimental studies of bud phenology under simulated climate change outdoors are deficient. We conducted a multifactorial field experiment with single (T, UVA, UVB) and combined treatments (UVA+T, UVB+T) of elevated temperature (T, +2 degrees C) and ultraviolet-B radiation (+30% UVB) in order to examine their impact on both male and female genotypes of aspen (Populus tremula L.). This study focuses on the effect of the treatments in years 2 and 3 after planting (2013, 2014) and follows how bud phenology is adapting in year 4 (2015), when the treatments were discontinued. Moreover, the effect of bud removal was recorded. We found that elevated temperature played a key role in delaying bud set and forcing bud break in intact individuals, as well as slightly delaying bud break in bud-removed individuals. UVB delayed the bud break in bud-removed males. In addition, both UVA and UVB interacted with temperature in year 3 and even in year 4, when the treatments were off, but only in male individuals. Axillary bud removal forced both bud break and bud set under combined treatments (UVA+T, UVB+T) and delayed both under individual treatments (T, UVB). In conclusion, male aspens were more responsive to the treatments than females and that effect of elevated temperature and UV radiation on bud set and bud break of aspen is not disappearing over 4-year study period.",,,,,"Julkunen-Tiitto, Riitta/GRR-9781-2022","Sivadasan, Unnikrishnan/0000-0002-3025-9780",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,OCT,2017,7,19,,,,,7998,8007,,10.1002/ece3.3352,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3352,,,,,,,,29043051,,,,,WOS:000412523700037,View Full Record in Web of Science

The implicated vectors of BTV in Europe are Culicoides species within the subgenus Avaritia (C. chiopterus, C. dewulfi, C. obsoletus and C. scoticus). Epidemiological data from Switzerland have shown that BTV, whose spread was eliminated at an early stage by vaccination campaigns, had not been circulating among livestock at higher altitudes where other species dominate the Culicoides fauna. In this study, we investigated the extent that Culicoides spp. prevailing at higher altitudes (mainly C. grisescens) can act as vectors for BTV. Methods: Culicoides were collected at farms in the pre-alpine region (two sites at 1550 m above sea level, masl, referred to as pre-alpine I; one site at 2030 masl, pre-alpine II) and, for comparative purposes, from the Swiss Plateau (one site, 650 masl). They were fed on bovine blood/BTV suspensions (BTV-1, 4 or 8) and incubated for eight days under a fluctuating temperature regime (13-25 degrees C, mean 19 degrees C), reflecting a mid-summer warm spell in the pre-alpine region. Susceptibility to BTV transmission was assessed from head homogenates by RT-qPCR and virus isolation. Results: Overall, 9196 female Culicoides were exposed to the three BTV strains through an artificial membrane, with feeding rates of 14-27%. Survival rates of blood-engorged Culicoides females at eight days post-infection depended on both virus serotype and altitude of origin. Virus dissemination (C-q <= the cut-off value as determined by serial virus dilutions) was confirmed only for BTV-1 in C. scoticus (dissemination efficiency 22.5%; 9/40) and C. obsoletus (5.6%; 1/18) from the Swiss Plateau area. There was no strong evidence of susceptibility to infection for Culicoides from the pre-alpine area when fed with all BTV strains (BTV-1, 4 and 8). Conclusions: This study confirms the susceptibility of C. scoticus and C. obsoletus to BTV-1 infection, including under cooler temperatures. Culicoides grisescens, which is highly abundant at higher altitudes, cannot be considered a potential vector under these temperature conditions.",,,,,"Torgerson, Paul R/M-4447-2013","Torgerson, Paul R/0000-0003-4277-9983; Veronesi, Eva/0000-0003-3411-7891",,,,,,,,,,,,,1756-3305,,,,,AUG 13,2018,11,,,,,,,,466,10.1186/s13071-018-3050-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-3050-y,,,,,,,,30103803,,,,,WOS:000441416600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three groups were fed with BR orally at the rate of 2 g/kg bw daily for 10 days prior to and during the period of experiment. Two of the four groups that were exposed to heat stress (HST i.e. to a temperature of 40 +/- 1 degrees C and relative humidity of 80 +/- 5% in an environmental chamber) for 4h daily for 5 or 10 days, received BR orally. The other two groups remained as BR treated and untreated non-heat stressed (NHST) controls.

FIELD STUDIES,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"The effects of photoperiod on reproductive development and yield of two Virginia, one Spanish and one Valencia peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) cultivar were investigated in the field at Kingaroy, Australia. The objective was to assess the importance of photoperiod as a limitation to post-flowering reproductive development in a cool subtropical environment. A total of five experimental sowings were made between the 1986/87 and 1988/89 growing seasons. Treatments consisted of either natural photoperiods (ranging from 11 to 14 h, depending on sowing date and growth stage) or long (16 h) photoperiods during a range of phenological stages, both pre- and post-flowering. Long photoperiods were achieved by using low intensity light from incandescent bulbs with equal extension periods in both morning and evening. Different sowing dates and seasons were used to produce a range of natural photoperiods, radiation and temperature regimes, while shadecloth was used to alter incident irradiance during the 1988/89 experiments. Photoperiod responses were significant in only one experiment (S2, 1986/87), and were due to effects of treatment during the immediate post-flowering period. Numbers of flowers, pegs and pods were reduced under long photoperiods in cv. Robut 33-1, and to a lesser extent, in cv. White Spanish. The Virginia cv. Uf78114-5 was unaffected. The effects of long photoperiods during this 30 day post-flowering treatment were not expressed until after the treatment period. Effects were relatively small and reproductive (pod) yields at maturity were not significantly reduced. The lack of strong photoperiod responses in the reportedly sensitive Valencia cv. NC17090 and the occurrence of the strongest response in the relatively insensitive cv. Robut 33-1 were unexpected. Analysis of climatic data from these experiments, and others reported in the literature, suggested interactions between photoperiod and temperature, with photoperiod effects being only significant at higher temperatures, i.e. in our studies, when mean daily temperature during the treatment period was 26.O-degrees-C. This finding is of considerable significance in assessing the importance of photoperiod sensitivity for cultivar adaptation to long day/subtropical environments. A subsequent paper in this series examines photoperiod x temperature interactions more closely under controlled environment conditions.",,,,,"Bell, Michael MJ/A-7741-2011","Bell, Michael MJ/0000-0002-3957-2685",,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-9409,,,,,,1991,42,7,,,,,1133,1149,,10.1071/AR9911133,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR9911133,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GL59600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

These methods provide estimates of the volatilization rate based on measurements of wind speed, temperature, and 1,3-D concentration in the atmosphere.

To manipulate climate on peatland, the prototyped Open Top Chambers (OTC) and automated rain-out shelters were used. OTCs increased daytime air temperatures by similar to 1.7 degrees C at the driest plots exposed for an increase of air temperature and reduced precipitation, while the increase of the average daily air temperature was lower than 0.9 degrees C. However, OTCs cooled down the peat temperature even by 0.8 degrees C and this effect was most pronounced for daytime rather than night-time conditions. The precipitation amount was reduced by 26%. The tea bags were buried at 8 cm depth for 83 and 172 days starting from the 19th of April 2019. Our observation proved that although decomposition rates were dependent on temperature, WTD and its fluctuations are the main factors controlling the rates of litter decomposition in waterlogged ecosystems like ours.

The two techniques can lead to conflicting requirements when considering winter and summer conditions, or even high daily temperature ranges. Therefore, the best solution for the summer can be the worst solution for the winter. It is necessary to identify insulation measures that conserve the mass dynamic behaviour. Experimental investigations were carried out on a single-family house to characterize the behaviour of two walls with different thermal inertia. Thermal simulations made it possible to explore different retrofit configurations also including dynamic strategies. The solutions were compared on comfort, energy savings and global cost. The study shows that the most suitable intervention is the maximization of the internal heat capacity and the introduction of an external insulation layer sealed in wintertime and ventilated in summer, thus maintaining the existing massive envelope seasonal dynamic behaviour by alternatively maximising thermal barrier effect and heat loss. Considering this, the authors introduced a recently patented dynamic system that reduces both summer discomfort levels and consumption, respectively, of about 20% and 43% respect to the worst retrofit solution.

By contrast, thermally homogeneous environments preclude behavioural thermoregulation, and ectotherms inhabiting these environments (particularly fish in which branchial respiration requires body temperature to follow water temperature) modify their biochemical capacities in response to long-term seasonal temperature fluctuations. Reptiles may also be active at seasonally varying body temperatures and could, therefore, gain selective advantages from regulating biochemical capacities. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that a reptile (the American alligator Alligator mississippiensis) that experiences pronounced seasonal fluctuations in body temperature will show seasonal acclimatisation in the activity of its metabolic enzymes. We measured body temperatures of alligators in the wild in winter and summer (N=7 alligators in each season), and we collected muscle samples from wild alligators (N=31 in each season) for analysis of metabolic enzyme activity (lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase). There were significant differences in mean daily body temperatures between winter (15.66+/-0.43degreesC; mean S.E.M.) and summer (29.34+/-0.21degreesC), and daily body temperatures fluctuated significantly more in winter compared with summer. Alligators compensated for lower winter temperatures by increasing enzyme activities, and the activities of cytochrome c oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly greater in winter compared with summer at all assay temperatures. The activity of citrate synthase was significantly greater in the winter samples at the winter body temperature (15degreesC) but not at the summer body temperature (30degreesC). The thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of mitochondrial enzymes decreased significantly in winter compared with in summer. The activity of mitochondrial enzymes was significantly greater in males than in females, but there were no differences between sexes for lactate dehydrogenase activity. The differences between sexes could be the result of the sex-specific seasonal demands for locomotor performance. Our data indicate that biochemical acclimatisation is important in thermoregulation of reptiles and that it is not sufficient to base conclusions about their thermoregulatory ability entirely on behavioural patterns.",,,,,,"Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,APR,2003,206,7,,,,,1193,1200,,10.1242/jeb.00223,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.00223,,,,,,,,12604579,,,,,WOS:000181969700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, starting from daily measurements of climatic variables such as net solar radiation, depth to water, wind speed, mean relative humidity, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and mean temperature, using the Random Forest, Additive Regression of Decision Stump, Multilayer Perceptron and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms, 24 estimation models, different in input variables, have been developed and compared. The data have been provided by USGS. They have been obtained from a measuring site in wetlands of Indian River County, Florida using the eddy-covariance technique. The accuracy of these models based on AI algorithms remains good even if the number of input variables is reduced from 7 to 3. Net solar radiation, mean temperature and mean relative humidity or wind speed measurements allow obtaining a sufficiently accurate estimation model. Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors provide slightly better performance than Additive Regression of Decision Stump and Multilayer Perceptron. The analyzed models show in most cases the lowest accuracy in the range 2-4 mm/day, while the highest accuracy is obtained in the ranges 0-2 mm/day and 6-8 mm/day, with the exception of the models based on the Additive Regression, which show similar levels of accuracy in the different considered sub-intervals.

Alterations in abundance of mosses due to global change may thus strongly influence carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling and hence cause feedback on climate. The effects of mosses on soil microbial activity are, however, still poorly understood. Our study aims at elucidating how and by which mechanisms bryophytes influence microbial decomposition processes of soil organic matter and thus soil nutrient availability. We present results from a field experiment in a subarctic birch forest in northern Sweden, where we partly removed the moss cover and replaced it with an artificial soil cover for simulating moss effects on soil temperature and moisture. We combined this with a fertilization experiment with N-15-labelled N for analysing the effects of moss N sequestration on soil processes. Our results demonstrate the capacity of mosses to reduce soil N availability and retard N cycling. The comparison with artificial soil cover plots suggests that the effect of mosses on N cycling is linked to the thermal insulation capacity of mosses causing low average soil temperature in summer and strongly reduced soil temperature fluctuations, the latter also leading to a decreased frequency of freeze-thaw events in autumn and spring. Our results also showed, however, that the negative temperature effect of mosses on soil microbial activity was in part compensated by stimulatory effects of the moss layer, possibly linked to leaching of labile substrates from the moss. Furthermore, our results revealed that bryophytes efficiently sequester added N from wet deposition and thus prevent effects of increased atmospheric N deposition on soil N availability and soil processes. Synthesis. Our study emphasizes the important role of mosses in carbon and nutrient cycling in high-latitude ecosystems and the potential strong impacts of reductions in moss abundance on microbial decomposition processes and nutrient availability in subarctic and boreal forests.",,,,,"Michelsen, Anders/L-5279-2014; Koranda, Marianne/E-7693-2012","Michelsen, Anders/0000-0002-9541-8658; Koranda, Marianne/0000-0002-3271-4521",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,MAR,2021,109,3,,,,,1424,1438,,10.1111/1365-2745.13567,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13567,,DEC 2020,,,,,,33776135,,,,,WOS:000600585000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The broiler performance was better in the insulated environment, where the broilers had higher feed intake, higher weight gain, better feed: gain ratio, lower mortality and higher production per area, Rectal temperature of birds reared on the non insulated environment was higher than the birds reared on the insulated environment. As the rearing densities increased, the mortality increased, however the production per area was higher.

Throughout the measurement periods, ranging from June to September 1990, eight sites in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch experimental watershed were monitored for water and energy fluxes and other meteorological and biological parameters. Corresponding spectral data were acquired with ground-based radiometers, low-altitude aircraft-mounted instruments, and Landsat thematic mapper sensors. Spectral indices were derived from measurements of surface reflectance, based on their response to variations in hydrologic parameters and sensitivity to unrelated variables, such as solar zenith angle and soil differences. A soil-adjusted vegetation index, SAVI (derived from red and NIR reflectance factors), was found to be highly correlated with the temporal changes in vegetation cover and biomass, but less successful in discriminating spatial differences in cover and biomass across the watershed. Significant relations were found between the surface-air temperature (T(s) - T(a)) difference and measurements of soil moisture content, though the shape differed from that previously published for bare soil. The relation between daily evaporation rate and measurements of (T(s) - T(a)) and daily net radiation was similar to that derived previously for irrigated pasture and dryland shortgrass in France but differed from that derived for irrigated wheat.

However, there is a lack of studies on the effects of tillage and cover crops on soil CO2 emissions on Andosols in the humid, subtropical climate. The present study aimed to quantify soil CO2 emissions and identify the factors accounting for CO2 emissions among no-tillage (NT) and moldboard plow (MP) systems under different cover crop treatments at an experimental site established in 2002 in Kanto, Japan. A split-plot field experiment was conducted from May 2017 to November 2018 comprising two tillage systems (NT and MP) and three cover crops: fallow, hairy vetch (HV), and rye (RY). Higher soil CO2 daily emissions at 80% of the measurements and significantly greater CO2 seasonal and annual emissions were observed in the NT system as compared to the MP system. The relationship between CO2 daily flux and soil temperature was well-described by exponential functions (p < 0.001). Soil volumetric water content (theta v) was significantly positively associated with soil CO2 daily emissions when soil temperature ranged from 10 degrees C to 20 degrees C (p < 0.05) and 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C (p < 0.01), and the response of soil CO2 flux to soil temperature and Ov was well-described by a multiplicative model (RMSE: 1.2920, R-2: 0.7777). Although there was no difference in soil temperature between NT and MP, significantly higher soil Ov was found in NT than in MP. In addition, significant exponential correlations were observed between soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and annual CO2 emissions in four different soil layers (0-2.5 cm, 0-7.5 cm, 0-15 cm, and 0-30 cm). The HV and RY cover crops had a positive effect on SOC stocks. NT increased SOC stocks significantly compared to MP at 0-2.5 cm (p < 0.001) and 0-7.5 cm (p < 0.05) depth while no significant SOC stock difference at 0-15 cm and 0-30 cm depth between NT and MP were observed. These results suggest that surface SOC enrichment and higher soil Ov result in higher soil CO2 emissions in 15-year NT systems on Andosols in the humid, subtropical climate of Kanto, Japan. The carbon sources and their proportions of soil CO2 emissions require further clarification to properly assess the benefits of NT in soil carbon sequestration.",,,,,"Gong, Yingting/GQI-0314-2022; Komatsuzaki, Masakazu/AAO-1306-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-7061,1872-6259,,,,MAR 15,2021,386,,,,,,,,114920,10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114920,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114920,,JAN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000613923000014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our previous experiments using a laboratory stock of D. hydei revealed that low temperatures (such as 15 degrees C and 18 degrees C) dramatically lower the vertical transmission rates of this spiroplasma. Therefore, we hypothesized that, in temperate regions, the infection frequencies may decrease in cool seasons but increase in the summer season. To clarify the temporal population dynamics of the spiroplasma infection, D. hydei were collected from two Japanese populations in 2006-2008 from May to early August, representing the only period when a number of D. hydei are collectable in Japan, and examined for spiroplasma infection. Within each year, the frequency of spiroplasma infection fluctuated considerably in both populations. Consistent with our hypothesis, the infection frequency showed an increasing trend in both populations in 2007. However, the data in 2006 and 2008 did not show consistent patterns of increase. The population dynamics of spiroplasma infection may be affected but not critically determined by temperature. Moreover, despite the fluctuation within each year, the infection frequencies seemed to be stable across the years. The frequencies of spiroplasma infection in D. hydei populations may be stabilized by multiple factors. One of these factors may involve a context-dependent positive effect of spiroplasma on the fitness of D. hydei, as was recently observed in laboratory experiments.",,,,,"Kageyama, Daisuke/B-4460-2010","Kageyama, Daisuke/0000-0002-9026-9825",,,,,,,,,,,,,0334-5114,1878-7665,,,,NOV,2010,52,1,,,,,41,45,,10.1007/s13199-010-0100-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-010-0100-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000287246200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

J.",,,Effective heritability of targets of sex-ratio selection under environmental sex determination,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Selection is expected to maintain primary sex ratios at an evolutionary equilibrium. In organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), targets of sex-ratio selection include the thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway (hereafter, sex determination threshold) and nest-site choice. However, offspring sex may be canalized for nests located in thermally extreme environments; thus, genetic variance for the sex determination threshold is not expressed and is invisible to direct selection. The concept of 'effective heritability' accounts for this dependence and provides a more realistic prediction of the expected evolutionary response to selection in the wild. Past estimates of effective heritability of the sex determination threshold, which were derived from laboratory data, suggested that the potential for the sex determination threshold to evolve in the wild was extremely low. We re-evaluated original estimates of this parameter by analysing field-collected measures of nest temperatures, vegetation cover and clutch sex ratios from nests in a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We coupled these data with measurements of broad-sense heritability of the sex determination threshold in C. picta, using an experiment that splits clutches of eggs between a constant temperature (i.e. typical laboratory incubation) and a daily fluctuating temperature (i.e. similar to natural nests) with the same mean. We found that (i) the effective heritability of the sex determination threshold appears to have been historically underestimated and the effective heritability of nest-site choice has been overestimated and (ii) significant family-by-incubation treatment interaction exists for sex for C. picta between constant- and fluctuating-temperature regimes.

Such systems use the ambient cold of surrounding air, which is transported into buildings by mechanical fan-driven ventilation systems. Only carefully designed and operated systems can be efficient enough to compete with other free-cooling techniques, such as evaporative cooling or even compressor-driven mechanical cooling systems. The efficiency of free cooling by enhanced night-time ventilation could be significantly improved if a model-based predictive weather control algorithm is used for operation control. The aim of this article is to present a generalized model-based predictive weather control (G-MPWC) algorithm that was developed with a detailed short time step numerical simulation of the thermal response of the building and free cooling system and simplified weather forecast data. The result of the G-MWPC is a set of control matrixes that includes data on the forecast required night-time air exchange rate and forecast daily coefficient of the performance of the free cooling system regarding the forecast daily average ambient air temperature and amplitude and the pre-set free cooling system on/off temperature difference. An additional matrix that includes data on forecast maximum indoor air temperature is developed for the case of the free cooling system being unable to fulfil pre-set thermal comfort requirements. A unique set of G-MWPS control matrixes must be developed for specific buildings and building operation conditions; afterwards, that control matrix can be used for the predicted controlling of the free cooling system by night time ventilation for the whole range of summer time meteorological conditions. In this article, the method and numerical model for developing a G-MPWC algorithm is presented as well as an example of a control matrix developed for a typical office room.

Information on leaf appearance rate is needed for many crop growth simulation models. This study was conducted to evaluate three different approaches used to predict leaf appearance for field grown spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The three approaches were: (1) a model based on the non-linear response function of daily leaf appearance rate to temperature and day length (NTDLAR model); (2) a model employing a constant phyllochron (PHYL model); and (3) a model using constant calendar day (CALDAY model). Foliar stages were recorded for the main stem of 'Katepwa' spring wheat grown on a Swinton loam soil for four years at Swift Current, SK. Each year, the experiment consisted of three unreplicated water treatments. The results indicated that 'Katepwa' wheat consistently produced either 7 or 8 leaves on the main stem. Comparing all treatments, phyllochron ranged from 73 to 88 degrees C d; there were significant differences in phyllochron among years, but the differences among treatments within a year were undetectable because none of the treatments experienced water stress during the leaf development phase during this study. The calendar time for successive leaf appearance for 'Katepwa' was fairly constant (5 - 6 days) during the study. Consequently, the CALDAY model performed better than did the PHYL model in predicting leaf appearance. The NTDLAR and CALDAY models had similar mean deviations and root mean square errors. However, the CALDAY model should only be applied to similar conditions under which the relationship was established because it was derived mainly from simple regression analysis. Unlike the CALDAY model, the NTDLAR model was designed to cover a wide range of temperature and daylength regimes, so it has a greater applicability than does the CALDAY model. Therefore, it was concluded that the NTDLAR model was the most reliable of the three.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0045-432X,,,,,OCT-DEC,1998,40,4,,,,,249,256,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000079166500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Both species showed significantly larger shoot elongation and biomass production inside the OTC over shrub-dominated vegetation, whereas smaller or reduced growth was detected inside the OTC over shrub-forb mixed vegetation. The variations of growth responses to warming between species of different vegetation types are discussed, especially in relation to interspecific competition under a simulated environmental change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0912-3814,,,,,JAN,2002,17,1,,,,,125,132,,10.1046/j.1440-1703.2002.00469.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1703.2002.00469.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000174643800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main objective of the present study was to provide experimental measurements to test such models. An apparatus was designed to simulate and study in laboratory conditions the flame and the near-field plume stemming from the combustion of an isolated shrub. The burner was made of a cylindrical wire mesh basket filled with a forest fuel ignited at the lower circumference of the basket. Three diameters (20, 28, and 40 cm) for the basket and two kinds of fuel (Pinus pinaster needles and excelsior) were used. Temperatures were measured inside and above the burner using type K thermocouples of 50-mum diameter. Three pairs of these sensors were especially used to estimate the upward gas velocity, thanks to the expected cross-correlation of thermal fluctuations. We obtained varied and non-steady regimes of combustion as desired, in particular the maximum heat release rates ranged between 30 and 180 kW. The structure of the visible flame and its temperatures were analyzed for a fully developed flamed The height of a flame was found to scale with the heat release rate according to the usual two-fifths power law, which enables a normalized flame height to be defined. Vertical temperature profiles in the flame were found to scale with the normalized height and radial temperature profiles fitted Gaussian laws well. The determination of gas velocity was uncertain, but the usual scaling also applied to the measurements. Scaling rules, which apply well to either steady turbulent diffusion flames on a porous gas burner or pool fires, hold for the non-steady flame on our forest fuel burner, when observing a fully developed flame.

The effect of biochar on soil properties and crop yield varies with crop, soil, biochar properties and climate. Thus, it is critical to select suitable biochar and their application amounts for ameliorating salt-affected soils while improving its conditions and crop yields. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of biochar application rates on soil properties, water and temperature conditions and crop yields in saline-alkali soils under cotton-sugarbeet intercropping. We used a three-year (2018-2020) field experiment with biochar application rates of 0, 10, 50 and 100 t ha(-1) in 2018, 0, 10, 25, 50 and100 t ha(-1) in 2019 and 0, 10, 25 and 30 t ha(-1) in 2020. Soil bulk density decreased and thus porosity increased with application of biochar. Soil pH decreased with increasing biochar application amount and the rate of change ranged from -0.003 to -0.004 per ton of biochar. Biochar application at 10 t ha(-1) increased soil water content (SWC) and weighted planar soil water storage (WPSWS) in all three experimental years, while oversupply of biochar decreased SWC. Application of biochar moderated soil temperature fluctuations. The yield of cotton and sugarbeet first increased and then decreased with increasing amount of biochar. Considering the effects of biochar on soil water, temperature, and crop yields, 10 t ha(-1) biochar amount was proposed as an appropriate application rate for saline-alkali soils.

The sampling area comprised contrasting ecosystems, including upwelling zones and oligotrophic subtropical gyres. Grazing impacts of mesozooplankton and 63-200 mu m microzooplankton on total chlorophyll a (Chl a), > 5 mu m Chl a, ciliates, and dinoflagellates were low for both zooplankton size fractions, always removing <1.5% of the standing stocks of these groups. Grazing had a slightly greater impact upon primary production (up to 10% of primary production consumed daily), although on most occasions grazing removed <1% of primary production per day. To account for the reduction of micrograzers by predators in the experimental bottles and the consequent reduction of grazing pressure, the data were corrected with knowledge on the decrease of microzooplankton during incubations and global estimates of microzooplankton grazing. The corrected grazing rates for mesozooplankton ranged from 4% to 28% of the primary production consumed daily, and from 1% to 2% of the standing stock of Chl a removed every day. The 63-200 mu m microzooplankton corrected grazing impact was always <5% of the primary production and standing stock consumed per day. The corrected grazing activity of 63-200 mu m microzooplankton and mesozooplankton rendered daily rations ranging from 3% to 38% of the body carbon consumed daily, not sufficient for basal metabolism in most of the areas studied.

We then use a mathematical model to characterize the response of the clock to a wide range of external cycle lengths and photoperiods. We show the existence of several domains of periodic entrainment with different ratios between the external cycle length and the period of the clock, and the presence of quasiperiodic and chaotic behaviors outside of the entrainment range.

However, field measurements in extremely dry environments face many difficulties and challenges, so few studies have examined water and vapour transport processes in the desert vadose zone. The main objective of this study is to analyse the mechanisms of soil water and vapour transport in the desert vadose zone (depth of similar to 350 cm) by using measured and modelled data in an extremely arid environment. The field experiments are implemented in an area of the Gobi desert in northwestern China to measure the soil properties, daily soil moisture and temperature, daily water-table depth and temperature, and daily meteorological records from DOYs (Days of Year) 114-212 in 2014 (growing season). The Hydrus-1D model, which simulates the coupled transport of water, vapour and heat in the vadose zone, is employed to simulate the layered soil moisture and temperature regimes and analyse the transport processes of soil water and vapour. The measured results show that the soil water and temperatures near the land surface have visible daily fluctuations across the entire soil profile. Thermal vapour movement is the most important component of the total water flux and the soil temperature gradient is the major driving factor that affects vapour transport in the desert vadose zone. The most active water and heat exchange occurs in the upper soil layer (depths of 0-25 cm). The matric potential change from the precipitation mainly re-draws the spatio-temporal distribution of the isothermal liquid water in the soil near the land surface. The matric potential has little effect on the isothermal vapour and thermal liquid water flux. These findings offer new insights into the liquid water and vapour movement processes in the extremely arid environment.

Using lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) from Black Lake, MI, we tested whether phenotypic variation differed among families reared in two constant (10 and 18 degrees C) and two fluctuating-temperature treatments (10-19 degrees C) representing temperatures experienced in the river and a simulated anthropogenic disturbance. Body length, body area, and yolk-sac area were quantified at hatch. Family-by-treatment interactions explained up to 50% of the variance observed among families in offspring hatch traits. Families incubated in 18 degrees C and the fluctuating anthropogenic treatment had 6-10 times higher variance in traits than those incubated at 10 degrees C. Hatched larvae were placed in raceways with ambient river water. Emergence body length, emergence timing, and growth were quantified upon emergence.

The excess of excitation energy on cellular organelles prone to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is further enhanced when plants growing in full sun concurrently experience drought and heat stress. These are the very conditions that promote the biosynthesis of a wide range of secondary metabolites. Plants display a highly integrated arsenal of ROS-detoxifying agents to keep ROS concentration under control for efficient signalling, while avoiding cell death. There is evidence that primary antioxidants, i.e., antioxidant enzymes and low molecular-weight antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid and glutathione, are depleted under a severe excess of radiant energy. Here we discuss about how relevant secondary metabolites, namely isoprene, carotenoids, and flavonoids may complement the function of primary antioxidants to avoid irreversible oxidative damage, when plants experience intense, even transient stress events. We offer evidence of how plants orchestrate daily the antioxidant machinery, when challenged against multiple environmental stresses. It is indeed conceivable that daily variations in sunlight irradiance and air temperature may greatly alter the effectiveness of primary and secondary ROS-detoxifying agents. Finally, we discuss about the possible inter-relation between isoprenoid and flavonoid metabolism in plants facing high light coupled with drought and heat stress, as a consequence of severe stress-induced redox imbalance.

The results demonstrate that the scaling of metabolism is especially important during low food winters. Reducing metabolism during winter permits individuals to grow to larger body length, reproduce successfully and release a greater number of eggs.

In this paper, a series of winter and summer experiments with respect to spatial location and time are carried out to measure temperature distribution under unconditioned empty stadium conditions, which are then utilized to assess thermal comfort with a revised PMV-PPD method. It is found that temperature distribution inside enclosed large-span membrane stadiums depends on solar irradiance and that temperature stratification, orientation and location effects are identified and quantified. Average inside and outside air temperature differences due to enclosure capability of membrane structures are 6.2 degrees C and 3.1 degrees C for summer and winter experiments.

An 11-year field experiment (2003-2013) with the same maize cultivar and two short-term experiments including different sowing dates and plant densities were conducted at Luancheng Agro-ecological Experimental Station in the North China Plain (NCP). The measured pheonological development, biomass and grain yield were used to calibrate and validate the APSIM-maize model. The results showed that APSIM-maize model could capture the biomass and grain yield of summer maize under the various management practices and weather conditions. After calibration and validation, five scenarios were simulated using the APSIM model. The simulated results showed that weather factors including sunshine hours and the diurnal temperature range during the grain fill stage had the positive effects on maize yield. For different management practices, plant density was the most important factor which affected the maize yield. The optimal plant density was approximate 8.6 plants/m2. Maize yield would be decreased with the sowing dates delayed after the middle of June. Meanwhile, earlier sowing before the end of May also reduced the grain production. The optimized sowing date and plant density could reduce the seasonal yield variation of maize caused by the weather factors.

We assessed the effects of acclimation to daily variance of temperature on thermal performance curves of swimming speed in helmeted water toad tadpoles (Calyptocephalella gayi). Acclimation treatments were 20 degrees C +/- 0.1 SD (constant) and 20 degrees C +/- 1.5 SD (fluctuating). We draw two key findings: first, tadpoles exposed to daily temperature fluctuation had reduced maximal performance (Z(max)), and flattened thermal performance curves, thus supporting the vertical shift or faster-slower hypothesis, and suggesting that overall swimming performance would be lower through an examination of temperatures under more realistic and ecologically-relevant fluctuating regimens; second, there was significant interindividual variation in performance traits by means of significant repeatability estimates. Our present results suggest that the widespread use of constant acclimation temperatures in laboratory experiments to estimate thermal performance curves (TPCs) may lead to an overestimation of actual organismal performance.

A particular herpesvirus was purified from naturally infected larval Pacific oysters, and its genome was completely sequenced. This virus has been classified as Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) within the family Malacoherpesviridae. Since 2008, mass mortality outbreaks among C. gigas in Europe have been related to the detection of a variant of OsHV-1 called mu Var. Additional data are necessary to better describe mortality events in relation to environmental-parameter fluctuations and OsHV-1 detection. For this purpose, a single batch of Pacific oyster spat was deployed in 4 different locations in the Marennes-Oleron area (France): an oyster pond (claire), a shellfish nursery, and two locations in the field. Mortality rates were recorded based on regular observation, and samples were collected to search for and quantify OsHV-1 DNA by real-time PCR. Although similar massive mortality rates were reported at the 4 sites, mortality was detected earlier in the pond and in the nursery than at both field sites. This difference may be related to earlier increases in water temperature. Mass mortality was observed among oysters a few days after increases in the number of PCR-positive oysters and viral-DNA amounts were recorded. An initial increment in the number of PCR-positive oysters was reported at both field sites during the survey in the absence of significant mortality.

However, the biotic and abiotic mechanisms regulating those two processes in sediments of a eutrophic estuary remains poorly understood. Here, we used N-15 stable isotope dilution technique to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of gross N mineralization (GNM) and gross NH4+ immobilization (GAI) in surface sediment (0-5 cm) along the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) in 4 cruises. Results showed that GNM rates varied spatially and increased with salinity, ranging from 0.15 to 1.99 mu g N g(-1) d(-1), while GAI varied more temporally and increased with temperature, ranging from 0 to 1.96 mu g N g(-1) d(-1). The net N mineralization (NNM) rates ranged from-0.24 to 1.84 mu g N g(-1) d(-1), NNM was higher in lower estuary mainly due to higher chlorophyll-induced higher GNM, while NNM was higher in low temperature season mainly due to the inhibition of GAI. As high turbidity in upper estuary reduced light penetration and hence primary production, the decrease of settling labile organic matter from the water column weaken benthic bacterial abundances, GNM and NNM rates, whereas inorganic N (especially NH4+) had greater effect on GAI than organic matter. As an NH4+ source, the contribution of sediment daily NNM to NH4+ and dissolved inorganic N (DIN) in the overlying water column increased from upstream to downstream (-5.81 to 110.74% and-0.09 to 1.27%, respectively), suggesting an increased importance of NNM for supporting primary production in the lower estuary.

The daily and total prey consumption of S. parcesetosum through the entire development of the larval instars as well as during three different periods of longevity of adult females and males feeding on nymphs or puparia of B. labaci as prey was examined. In addition, the daily prey consumption of the adult females where the number of B. tabaci puparia was altered was studied at two different temperatures in the laboratory. The results showed that the mean daily prey consumption of nymphs or puparia of B. tabaci by larval instars of S. parcesetosum increased gradually as development progressed at both temperatures. Significant differences were found in the mean total prey consumption among the different predatory larval instars. In total, S. parcesetosum consumed during its entire larval development significantly more nymphs than puparia; at 18 degrees C it consumed a mean of 1,566.1 (female) and 1,443.9 (male) nymphs or 280.0 (female) and 250.8 (male) puparia, while at 30 degrees C, it consumed a mean of 1,119.1 (female) and 979.9 (male) nymphs or 188.2 (female) and 171.6 (male) puparia. Over the three studied periods of the adult stage of S. parcesetosum, the mean daily prey consumption by the females and males fluctuated irregularly at both temperatures. At 18 degrees C and 30 degrees C, both females and males consumed significantly more nymphs than puparia. No significant differences were found between females and males with respect to consumption of nymphs, although significant differences were found between the sexes with respect to consumption of puparia, but at 18 degrees C only. The mean total prey consumption over the three studied adult stages was 2,188.4 (female) and 1,994 (male) nymphs or 727.1 (female) and 624.8 (male) puparia at 18 degrees C, while at 30 degrees C the mean values were 3,947.7 (female) and 3,577.3 (male) nymphs or 1,600.5 (female) and 1,448.8 (male) puparia. S. parcesetosum adapted smoothly to fluctuating prey availability, where the mean daily prey consumption became higher when 50 puparia/day was offered. In contrast, the predator consumed most individuals when the number of prey supplied was 10 or 5 puparia/day. Prey consumption decreased during the second experimental week in the trial, before which 50 puparia/day had been offered. In the other trials, before which 20, 10 and 5 puparia/day had been offered, a considerable increase in prey consumption was noted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1612-4758,,,,,JUN,2005,78,3,,,,,179,186,,10.1007/s10340-005-0091-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-005-0091-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000229970600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

FOOD LIMITATION IN THE NURSERY HABITAT AND LARVAL CANNIBALISM",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,,,,,,,,,,,,"The grapsid crab Armases miersii breeds in supratidal rock pools on the northern shore of Jamaica, West Indies. In 5 replicate field experiments, temperature and salinity were monitored during the course of larval development, and the hypothesis was tested that these rock pools represent a food-limited environment for the development of planktotrophic crab larvae. Food limitation should select for and, hence, may explain, ontogenetic traits that have been observed in the early larval stages of this species: abbreviated development, enhanced initial energy reserves, starvation resistance, and potential for partially endotrophic development (facultative lecithotrophy). In a rock pool with only 1 to 2 parts per thousand salinity, in situ growth (measured as change in carbon content per larva) and development (occurrence of moulting to subsequent stages) were retarded, and only the zoea II stage was reached within a 6 d observation period. Successful larval development to the megalopa stage was observed in salinities ranging from 5 to 24 parts per thousand and temperatures between 24 and 32 degrees C. Diurnal temperature variation (up to 7 degrees C) and sudden salinity changes (up to 16 parts per thousand) after heavy rain falls did not visibly influence larval growth or development. These field observations show that the larvae of A. miersii are very tolerant of extremely low and variable salinity and, hence, are well adapted to survive and develop under the harsh and unstable physical conditions prevailing in supratidal rock pools. Larval growth in all 5 experiments was significantly reduced and development delayed (only from the zoea III stage) under natural (unmanipulated control) conditions compared with sibling larvae that received Artemia sp, nauplii as an additional food source. These results provide evidence that food is actually a Limiting factor in supratidal rock pools, where larvae of A. miersii develop. In a series of 5 replicate laboratory experiments, the possible significance of cannibalism, especially in late stages, was tested. Cannibalistic activity shows an increasing trend with decreasing endotrophic potential of subsequent larval stages, reaching a maximum in the megalopa. Thus, multiple release of larvae in rock pools may provide younger larvae as a potential food source for older conspecifics, and cannibalism may be a nutritional buffer (comparable with nurse eggs) in a food-limited breeding habitat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,,,,,FEB,1995,117,1-3,,,,,83,89,,10.3354/meps117083,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps117083,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QJ84800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such manipulation could alter terpenoid profiles and modify herbivory levels significantly.

Fourteen terpenoids accounted for 95% of the total amount of volatiles. The most abundant compound was alpha-pinene, which accounted for 65% of total terpenoids present.

Continuous measurements were made of the air-sea fluxes of radiation and sensible and latent heat, and a conductivity/temperature/depth cast to 400 m was made about every 6 hours. The aim was to close the heat budget of a sample volume of the surface mixed layer to within 10 W m-2, in preparation for our participation in the 1992-1993 Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere-Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE). Temperature and salinity between the surface and 30-m depth were quite uniform, but below 30 m, variability was observed which suggested the possible intrusion of horizontal and vertical advection of heat. Heat content was analyzed for depths of 40 m and 20 m; bulk Richardson numbers generally greater than 0.8 and 0.4, respectively, in the two cases indicated that diapycnal mixing through the bottom of the 40-m volume could be neglected at 40 m and possibly at 20 m (Peters et al., 1988; Godfrey and Lindstrom, 1989). An eddy diffusivity for salt at 20 m was obtained to account for the steady decrease of observed freshwater content in the top 20 m over that expected from the surface flux. Using this diffusivity, the turbulent heat flux through 20 m was of order 6 W m-2, supporting the view that vertical mixing of heat was small even at this depth. Then, neglecting advection and vertical mixing, the heat budget closure to 40-m depth was satisfied to about 25 W m-2 on average over the period, but both integrated heat and freshwater time series were ''noisy'' because of variability below 30 m. Limited to 20-m depth, the average difference between incident energy and heat content was reduced to about 12 W m-2, with close agreement over the diurnal cycle. The model for air-sea exchange of sensible and latent heat by Liu et al. (1979) is verified at low wind speeds, although it may overestimate slightly for winds over the range 3-6 m s-1. This study has identified several possible sources of measurement, parameterization, and sampling error in determining the net heat flux into the ocean; however, with good sampling for the advective components, errors in heat budgets should be within the 10 W m-2 accuracy aimed for during COARE.",,,,,"Bradley, Frank/I-6574-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,DEC 15,1993,98,C12,,,,,22521,22532,,10.1029/93JC01855,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JC01855,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993MU34500002,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Brown, HE; Jamieson, PD; Moot, DJ",,,,"Brown, Hamish E.; Jamieson, Peter D.; Moot, Derrick J.",,,Predicting the transpiration of lucerne,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crop transpiration rate is often predicted as the minimum of the supply of water from the roots and the demand for water from the shoots. A common method for predicting transpiration demand is the transpiration efficiency approach, which uses daily dry matter growth, constant transpiration efficiency coefficient (omega) and the vapour pressure gradient from the leaf to the atmosphere. The former is usually represented by daytime averaged atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD'(z)), and assumes that the difference between air temperature and leaf temperature is small. In this paper we show that this assumption is likely to be incorrect in cool, moist environments where unstressed leaves may become substantially warmer than the surrounding air. We used VPD'(z) to calculate an apparent omega for field grown lucerne and found it increased from 1.5 to 3.5 Pa across a mean daily temperature range of 7-18 degrees C. We present an alternative method for calculating transpiration demand which we call the canopy conductance approach, which uses the product of VPD'(z), intercepted radiation (R-i) and a canopy conductance coefficient ((-)(T)). Experimental data showed transpiration demand of lucerne was linearly related to R-i and VPD'(z) and, in contrast to the variability of the derived value of omega, a constant and stable (-)(T) of 0.45 mm MJ(-1) kPa(-1) was derived. Predictions of transpiration were compared with transpiration calculated from soil water balance measurements for dryland and irrigated lucerne crops grown over 3 years at Lincoln University, Canterbury, New Zealand. The canopy conductance approach accurately (+/- 0.05 mmd(-1), RMSD = 26% of observation mean) predicted transpiration from an independent data set, confirming its simplicity and efficacy. Calculations of transpiration using the transpiration efficiency approach with a constant omega of 5.0 Pa underestimated transpiration by 1.4 mm d(-1) (RMSD = 126%). However, using omega and changing it in proportion to radiation use efficiency (which changed in response to temperature) substantially improved the accuracy of the growth approach (+/- 0.10 mm d(-1), RMSD = 30%). The methods presented can be adopted to improve the generic applicability of transpiration predictions in crop simulation models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have focused on these processes from coast to shelf and across slopes by tidal dynamics. Therefore, a numerical model was implemented with a high resolution to simulate the influence of the tide on mass transport. The output of the model indicated that the tidal residual current produced by the diurnal tide is dominant and primarily distributed along with the shelf break and near the coast, and water stratification amplifies this residual current system. Water exchange processes were evaluated utilizing passive tracer dyes to demonstrate the influence of the tides on the channel and bay. The tracer residence time ranged from a few days to a week and was affected by the considered representative region's topography and area.

Salinity, temperature, nutrients, and light are considered essential parameters to explain growth and distribution of macroalgal assemblages in coastal zones. Goals. In order to evaluate the effect of salinity on the growth properties of Caulerpa sertularioides, we conducted this study under laboratory conditions to find out how salinity affects the distribution of this species in coastal tropical environments. Methods. Five ranges of salinity were used for the experiments (15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 ppt), simulating in situ salinity conditions on the south Pacific Coast of Colombia. The culture was grown in an environmental chamber with controlled temperature and illumination, and a 12: 12 photoperiod. The following growth variables were measured weekly: wet biomass, stolon length (cm), number of new fronds and rhizomes. In the experimental cultures, growth (increase in wet biomass and stolon length) was calculated as the relative growth rate (RGR), expressed as a percentage of daily growth. Results. Significant differences (p < 0.001) were found between 15 ppt and the remaining treatments (20, 25, 30, and 35 ppt). The highest growth rates were recorded at 25 ppt (4.82 % d(-1)), while at 15 ppt, whitening and progressive deterioration of C. sertularioides fragments were observed. These results are consistent with the natural habitat of C. sertularioides in Tumaco Bay (Narino, Colombia), where it is found in areas with average salinities of 24 ppt during its annual cycle.

Although solar radiation can reduce SBR urediniospore survival, limited information is available on how solar radiation affects SBR progress within soybean canopies. Such information can aid in developing accurate SBR prediction models. To manipulate light penetration into soybean canopies, structures of shade cloth attenuating 30, 40, and 60% sunlight were constructed over soybean plots. In each plot, weekly evaluations of severity in lower, middle, and upper canopies, and daily temperature and relative humidity were recorded. Final plant height and leaf area index were also recorded for each plot. The correlation between amount of epicuticular wax and susceptibility of leaves in the lower, middle, and upper canopies was assessed with a detached leaf assay. Final disease severity was 46 to 150% greater in the lower canopy of all plots and in the middle canopy of 40 and 60% shaded plots. While daytime temperature within the canopy of nonshaded soybean was greater than shaded soybean by 2 to 3 degrees C, temperatures recorded throughout typical evenings and mornings of the growing season in all treatments were within the range (10 to 28.5 degrees C) for SBR development as was relative humidity. This indicates temperature and relative humidity were not limiting factors in this experiment. Epicuticular wax and disease severity in detached leaf assays from the upper canopy had significant negative correlation (P = 0.009, R = 0.84) regardless of shade treatment. In laboratory experiments, increasing simulated total solar radiation (UVA, UVB, and PAR) from 0.15 to 11.66 MJ m(-2) increased mortality of urediniospores from 2 to 91%. Variability in disease development across canopy heights in early planted soybean may be attributed to the effects of solar radiation not only on urediniospore viability, but also on plant height, leaf area index, and epicuticular wax, which influence disease development of SBR.

For convenience, the majority of laboratory studies on intertidal organisms have acclimated individuals to permanently submerged conditions, and thus we currently know little about how acclimation to cyclic emersion-immersion influences the ability of intertidal organisms to cope with fluctuations in environmental conditions. In the present study, the green shore crab Carcinus maenas was acclimated to either a simulated tidal regime of continuous emersion-immersion (tidal) or to permanently submerged conditions (non-tidal). Aquatic oxygen consumption was assessed when crabs were exposed to cooling (15 degrees C - 5 degrees C) or warming (15 degrees C - 25 degrees C) regimes. Tidal crabs had lower levels of oxygen consumption over the 15 degrees C - 20 degrees C range. During acute thermal stress, the Q10 values of non-tidal crabs increased as the temperature declined to 5 degrees C, whereas tidal crabs maintained relatively consistent Q10 values across the temperature range (5 degrees C-25 degrees C). These changes in oxygen consumption were paralleled by changes in haematological parameters. Tidal crabs had higher levels of haemocyanin which may have augmented oxygen delivery to the tissues and buffered acid-base imbalances. Surprisingly lactate levels were higher in tidal crabs, these appeared unconnected to anaerobic metabolism, but may have been an important metabolic fuel for tidal crabs. These results suggest that acclimation to a simulated tidal cycle may result in different physiological responses to environmental stressors and as such is an important consideration when assessing the responses of intertidal animals in a laboratory setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,DEC,2021,545,,,,,,,,151630,10.1016/j.jembe.2021.151630,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2021.151630,,SEP 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000703467700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

To be useful, the trees must also be able to withstand dry conditions in summer when temperatures can be very high and droughts become severe quickly. Here, we report a study in which mulberry seedlings were grown in a greenhouse under a variety of simulated soil water conditions reflecting potential summer scenarios in the hydro-fluctuation belt of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. We compared the responses of two pretreatment groups of mulberry seedlings to different levels of drought stress. The pretreatment groups differed with respect to drought hardening: the daily-managed (DM) group had relative soil moisture held constant in the range 70-80 %, while the drought-hardened (DH) group had relative soil moisture held constant at 40-50 %. Following the month-long pretreatment of seedlings, the two groups of young trees (DM and DH) were then respectively subjected to three levels of drought stress for a month: normal watering, moderate drought stress, and severe drought stress. A series of measurements comparing the physiological status of the plants in the two groups were then made, and the following results were obtained: (1) As drought stress increased, the heights, base diameters, root surface areas, photosynthetic rates (Pn), stomatal conductances (Gs), and transpiration rates (Tr) of the mulberry trees in both groups (DM and DH) decreased significantly, while the specific root area and abscisic acid (ABA) contents had increasing trends. Root activity and instantaneous water use efficiency of mulberry trees in both groups (DM and DH) were all raised under drought stress conditions than under normal watering, but the root/shoot ratio and leaf water potential were lowered. (2) At the same level of soil water content, the heights, base diameters, root/shoot ratios, root surface areas, specific root areas, photosynthetic rates (Pn), stomatal conductances (Gs), and transpiration rates (Tr) of the young mulberry trees in the DH were all significantly higher than those of the control group (DM). Leaf water potential, instantaneous water use efficiency, and abscisic acid content of DH were all significantly lower than DM. Under different degrees of drought stress, the growth of mulberry trees will be inhibited, but the trees can respond to the stress by increasing the root absorptive area and enhancing capacity for water retention. Mulberry trees demonstrate strong resistance to drought stress, and furthermore drought resistance can be improved by drought hardening during the seedling stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,OCT,2013,20,10,,,,,7103,7111,,10.1007/s11356-012-1395-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1395-x,,,,,,,,23250728,,,,,WOS:000324815100038,View Full Record in Web of Science

The College of Aboureyhan is a part of the University of Tehran and the above-mentioned farm is located in the lowland of the southeast of Tehran, Iran. For the purposes of this research study it was planned to measure and record the field data in a plot of 18 m(2). The hydraulic conductivity data were measured in 18 test points inside the study area using the inverse auger-hole method. Experiments were carried out from August 16, 2005 to June 14, 2006. The recorded filed data were then used to calculate the saturated hydraulic conductivity data using Excel software. The relationship between soil temperature, water temperature, and also water's viscosity with hydraulic conductivity, respectively, were determined. The results of the statistical analysis involving SAS software demonstrated that the variation of temperature can considerably affect the saturated hydraulic conductivity values. The results showed that the lowest values of K-s were obtained in the winter when the water, soil, and air temperature were minimal and these values increased when the temperature increased. The effect of the means of daily K values (values measured in each sample date K-d) and their corresponding soil temperature adjusted values on drain spacing was determined compared with the average of total K values. The maximum over- and underestimation of drain spacing was 19.1 and 23.3%, respectively, for measured values. These estimations were 9 and 16% for adjusted ones.

Nine practical diets were formulated to contain three protein levels (36%, 41% and 46%), each with three lipid levels (8%, 12% and 16%), in order to produce a range of P/E ratios (from 19.8 to 28.6 mg protein kJ(-1)). Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 60 fish in sea floating cages (1.5 x 1.5 x 2.0 m). Fish were fed twice daily (06:30 and 16:30) to apparent satiation for 8 weeks. The water temperature fluctuated from 26.5 to 32.5 degreesC, the salinity from 32 parts per thousand to 36 parts per thousand and dissolved oxygen content was approximately 7 mg l(-1) during the experimental period. The results showed that the growth was significantly affected by dietary P/E ratio (P<0.05). Fish fed the diets with 46% protein (12% and 16% lipid, P/E ratio of 26.7 and 25.7 mg protein kJ(-1)) had the highest specific growth rates (SGR) (4.26 and 4.24% day(-1)). However, fish fed the diet with 41% protein and 12% lipid showed comparable growth (4.20% day(-1)), and had higher protein efficiency ratio (PER), protein productive value (PPV) and energy retention than other groups (P<0.05). No significant differences in survival were found among dietary treatments. Carcass lipid content positively correlated with dietary lipid level irrespective of protein level and inversely correlated with carcass moisture content. Carcass protein and ash contents increased with increasing dietary lipid at each protein level. These results suggest that the diet containing 41% protein and 12% lipid with P/E of 25.9 mg protein kJ(-1) is optimal for Japanese seabass.

Fluctuations can affect the ecological and evolutionary processes that make species more successful competitors. For example. fluctuating conditions can create selection pressures for traits that are profitable in adaptation to fast climate change. On an ecological timescale, environmental fluctuations can facilitate species competitive success by reducing other species' population sizes. Climate change could then enhance species invasions into new areas if fluctuation-adapted invaders displace their native competitors in chancing environments. We tested experimentally whether fast environmental fluctuations, either past (on an evolutionary timescale) or present (on an ecological timescale) affect species competitive success. Bacteria that evolved in either constant or fluctuating temperature were set to compete with the dominant invader Serratia marcescens, which had also evolved in either constant or fluctuating temperature. Moreover, the competition experiments were conducted in environments with similarly constant or fluctuating thermal conditions. The results showed that temperature fluctuations during competition, i.e. on an ecological timescale. made the invader more successful. Surprisingly, we found that the invaders' or its competitor species' evolution in fluctuating environments did not affect the outcome of the competition.

Abiotic influences on seed longevity and dormancy were investigated by comparing seeds maintained at 5 degrees C with seeds experiencing fluctuating day/night temperatures (40 degrees C/20 degrees vs. 50 degrees C/30 degrees C) under dry and moist conditions. Acacia seed demonstrated no dormancy and initial germinability was >82% in the laboratory. Variability of Leucaena seed was >97%, but seed coat dormancy limited germination to <7%. Persistence of Acacia seeds in the soil seed bank varied with depth. After 42 days the viable seed population of Acacia was reduced by 10 and 80% for surface and buried seeds, respectively, and no viable seeds were present after 3.5 months of burial. In contrast, Leucaena seeds on the soil surface exhibited no significant decline in viability over 60 days and attrition of buried seed was <11%. After 3.5, 6 and 12 months of burial, 86, 81 and 71% of the Leucaena seeds dispensed remained viable, but the hard seed coat limited germination to 5, 2 and 0%, respectively. Loss of dormancy of Leucaena seeds stored in the laboratory over 7, 30 and 78 days was 7, 12 and 19%. Thus, the 29% attrition after 1 year of burial was probably associated with a gradual loss of seed coat dormancy. Light levels (full sun and 25% full sun) manipulated with neural density shade cloth had no significant influence on surface seed viability for either species. Temperature and moisture interacted to influence Leucaena seed coat dormancy and embryo viability, but fluctuating temperatures under dry conditions affected neither viability nor germination. However, when moisture was available, germinability of seeds in the 40 degrees C/20 degrees C regime was higher (41%) than that of the control group maintained at 30 degrees C(7%). All seeds in the 50 degrees C/30 degrees C regime imbibed water within 50 days, but non germinated.

Two experiments were conducted: (1) from zoae I to megalopae stage and (2) from megalopa to juvenile stage. Larvae from eight females from Paranagua Bay, Parana, Brazil were obtained. After eclosion, for the first experiment, 100 zoea larvae from five females were acclimated, individualized and transferred to small aquariums with five distinct salinity treatments (S0, S5, S15, S25 and S35). For the second experiment, 50 megalopae from three females were individualized in aquariums in the same salinity treatments. Both experiments were conducted in incubator BOD with a constant temperature of 25 degrees C and photoperiod of 12 hours (light/ dark). Larvae were fed daily with eggs and naupli newly hatched of Artemia sp. The salinity affected the survival rate during the development in both experiments. Higher survival from zoea I to megalopa stage occurred in salinities 25 and 35 PSU, while from megalopa to juvenile stage in salinities 15 and 25 PSU. In both experiments the larvae did not tolerate low salinities as adults, with total mortality in S0 and S5.

Currently, irrigation scheduling is based mostly on farmers experience, and the amount of water applied to the same (each) crop varies considerably. The main objective of this work was to analyse whether historical crop evapotranspiration could be used to improve irrigation scheduling of horticultural crops. Actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was estimated as the product of actual values of reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) and crop coefficients (K-c). A class A evaporative pan, located in the centre of a grass plot within a typical greenhouse, was used to determine ETo, and the pan coefficient was experimentally measured. K-c was calculated from leaf area index (LAI) values. A simple model was used to estimate LAI as a function of thermal time, and actual temperature values were used to calculate thermal time. During the whole 1993/94 growing season, estimated ET, values of a melon crop were close to measured ETc values. The mean absolute error was 0.2 mm d(-1). Historical daily values of reference evapotranspiration (EToh) were calculated as the average of daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) values from a data set of 14 years. Historical daily values of crop coefficient (K-ch) were determined from LAI values. Average temperature values from a data set of 11 years were used to calculate thermal time and to estimate LAI values. The use of ETh for irrigation scheduling was theoretically studied by using a simple water balance model applied to a range of representative soil types in a melon crop. For three planting dates in each of 11 cropping seasons, both ETh and ETc values were used to calculate the amount of irrigation water. When ETh was lower than ETc the soil water was depleted, and cumulative soil water deficits were quantified. In general, soil water deficits were not detected when ETh was used for schedule the irrigation. The use of ETh is a simple method for estimating crop water requirements within a greenhouse, and could be easily adopted by farmers.",,,,,"Gallardo, Marisa/C-3668-2015; Fereres, Elias/R-4451-2019; Bonachela, Santiago/W-2458-2018","Gallardo, Marisa/0000-0002-9031-8762; Bonachela, Santiago/0000-0002-1963-1668; Orgaz, Francisco/0000-0002-5567-6193",,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,2406-6168,90-6605-934-6,,,,2001,,559,,,,,383,389,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2001.559.57,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2001.559.57,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000173292200057,View Full Record in Web of Science

With no additional dehumidification system, only the radiant floor cooling system prevents floor condensation. In this case, the effects of the control of the cooling system on the indoor conditions can be changed because of the thermal inertia of the systems. Also different types of control system can be composed according to the control methods, which can affect the construction cost in the design stage. Therefore, the control methods for the radiant cooling system with respect to floor surface condensation must be studied. Furthermore, because Korean people's lifestyle involves sitting on the floor, it is necessary to evaluate if a floor cooling system will influence the thermal comfort of the occupants. This study intends to clarify the control methods of the radiant floor cooling system and to analyze the control performance and applicability of each control method with regard to the floor surface condensation and comfort by computer simulations and experiments on the control methods of the radiant floor cooling system. The results of computer simulations and experiments show that water temperature control is better than water flow control with respect to temperature fluctuations in controlling room air temperature. To prevent floor surface condensation, the supply water temperature could be manipulated according to the dew point temperature in the most humid room, and in individual rooms, the water flow rate (on/off control) can be controlled. Also, the results of radiant cooling experiments show that the floor surface temperature remained above 21 degrees C, the temperature difference among surfaces remained below 6 degrees C, and the vertical air temperature difference remained below 1.9 degrees C, conforming well to comfort standards.

To operate chillers efficiently, chiller staging is a tactic which involves identifying the optimum switch-over points of chillers and pumps at different cooling loads and ambient conditions. By analyzing the operating data of a multiple-chiller plant, it was found that the average plant efficiency could be improved to 1.15 kW/ton compared with the existing average value of 1.40 kW/ton, and the total chiller and pump power could be saved by 17.6% annually. Another tactic of enhancing the efficiency of air-cooled chillers is to lower the condensing temperature during below-design ambient conditions. Simulation and experiments are required to explore the controllability of condensing temperature, and to identify the boundary and dynamic response of parameters.",,,,,"Yu, Fu-wing/F-2929-2015; Chan, K.T./A-9046-2015","Yu, Fu-wing/0000-0003-4938-1206; Chan, K.T./0000-0002-0186-0817",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7-5323-7335-5,,,,2003,,,,,,,1419,1424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000221355500257,View Full Record in Web of Science

Modelling the temperature effects on phenological development, crop architecture and disease infection in maize contributes to the development of well-adapted, early-maturing varieties. Details of modelling these three aspects of maize growth were presented. The first focussed on quantifying the effect of air or soil temperature on maize phenological development. Crop growth was divided into two periods: vegetative (planting to silking) and grain filling (silking to maturity). A third period (planting to emergence) was separated within the vegetative period. Heat unit systems based on daily temperature response functions were developed to produce the most consistent heat unit sums for each period. The best fits of these functions were determined by minimizing standard deviations and coefficients of variation of these sums for each thermal period over locations and years. Calculated temperature response functions estimated thermal periods more consistently than growing degree days (GDD) for all three periods. The largest improvement was made in the silking to maturity period. The second aspect was a study of crop architecture. Methods were developed to mathematically characterize the structure of a canopy in terms of leaf area and leaf angle distributions with crop height and across the row. These calculations, in turn, were input to a soil-plant-atmosphere model to calculate interception of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Model calculations of PAR interception compared well with measurements for a range of plant types and plant population densities (R-2=0.76). The third aspect was quantifying growth of Fusarium in maize. Differential equations were used to relate Fusarium rates of growth in maize ears to air temperature, relative humidity and precipitation. Integration of these equations over time produced quantitative estimates of fungal infection. Model calculations were compared to visual ratings of fungal infection for two Fusarium species over three years (R-2=0.92). In each of the three aspects of this study, modelling tested our understanding of the processes involved and the dominant factors controlling these processes. Thus, modelling was an integral part of the scientific approach, synthesizing experimental data in a quantitative conceptual framework and identifying dominant factors and parameters which required additional focussed experimental evaluation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-4271,1918-1841,,,,AUG,1998,78,3,,,,,421,429,,10.4141/S97-095,http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S97-095,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000076608100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Five of these tags popped up and transmitted positions, and detailed data on diving behaviour, ambient water temperature and daily movement were received via ARGOS transmission from two tags. One tag was later found on a beach, allowing a complete archival data set to be downloaded and geolocation estimates provided by software on-board the pop-up tags and those based on the complete archival tag data sets to be compared. The tags indicated rapid movement away from release sites; three south-easterly displacements (222 km (120 nm), 222 km (120 nm), and 1185.3 km (640 nm) net) appeared to be associated with the East Australian Current, one moved 555.6 km (300 nm) directly east, and the last tag moved offshore and then back towards the coast over a 2-month period for a net displacement of 384 km (207 nm). Based on displacement speeds and diving behaviour, it was concluded that five of the seven fish survived capture and handling for periods ranging from 3 to 64 days. The fate of the other two is unknown. Estimates of longitude made on board the pop-up tag were very similar to the best estimates that could be made using the complete archival data set; however, pop-up tag latitude estimates were significantly more variable than those using the archival data. In the two cases in which pop-up tags were scheduled to stay on the marlin for more than 3 months, the tags detached prematurely, after 39 and 64 days.

Channels were completely ice covered between December and March. During this period, the ice thickness increased from 50 to 300 mm after which 50% of the ice was experimentally removed and followed by c. 2.5-fold increase in discharge to simulate the effects of spring flood. Large substrata provided preferred habitats but areas with small substratum sizes were also used when full surface ice provided above-stream cover and the stream discharge was relatively low. The fish remained nocturnal throughout the study but the level of day activity significantly increased as the surface ice became thicker. Maximum movement distance during a 24 h period and homing-at-dawn behaviour remained at a constant level throughout the main winter, but significantly changed during the simulated spring flood (mean +/- S.E. maximum extent of movements within 24 It increased from 1.1 +/- 0.1 to 3.0 +/- 0.5 m; homing behaviour decreased from the highest level of 89.3 +/- to 34.6% during spring flood). Overwinter survival was high (92.9%). Relative mass increase during the study ranged from -8.3 to 28.5%, and 84% of the juvenile Atlantic salmon gained mass. The highest rates of mass increase were associated with frequent movements between areas of different substratum size. The results indicate that during winter: (1) Atlantic salmon parr preferred large substratum cover compared with surface ice cover at the fish densities studied here, (2) juvenile Atlantic salmon were predominantly nocturnal but diurnal activity increased as surface ice became thicker and (3) increase in water discharge during spring altered the behaviour of juvenile Atlantic salmon and may have caused additional habitat shifts.

All of the experiments selected were conducted at standard temperature and with ad libitum feeding. The articles in this database were published from 1980 to 2015, and represented a total of 12,277 broilers, 57 trials, and 384 basic treatments. Data ranged from 3 to 66, 0.077 to 3.322, 7.10 to 15.37, and 7.3 to 35.0 for A (d), mean BW (kg), AMEn (MJ/kg) and CP (%), respectively. Equations were established from regression calculations to calculate daily heat production as a function of BW, daily AME intake (MEI) as a function of BW, DG, FCG and PCG, PCG as a function of A and FCG, and FCG as a function of BW, protein efficiency (PE), AMEn, and CP. The combination of these equations expressing MEI, PCG, or FCG with equations expressing the definitions of PE, AME (from AMEn), and DFI (from MEI) constituted a system of 6 equations which could be used to determine DFI values from the values of AMEn, CP, A, BW, and DG. Using the values of AMEn, CP, A, BW, and DG from the database, the DFI values calculated with this system of equations showed a reasonable correlation with the DFI values measured (R-2 = 0.880). This system of 6 equations yielded values for DFI, PE, PCG, and FCG that were in agreement with the classical effects produced by increased CP values, or by reduced fat deposition associated with genetic selection for leanness. This system of 6 equations might thus be considered an interesting framework for future nutritional modelling systems.

In this paper, the influence of the heat-rain cyclic and natural aging on the physical and mechanical properties of expanded perlite mortar has been studied. The expanded perlite mortar specimens were subjected to 80 heat-rain cycles (the maximum temperature rises to 70 degrees C, and the spray volume reaches 1 l/(m(2) min)) and 60-day natural aging tests (the daily average temperature is 23 degrees C, with the maximum temperature reaching 36 degrees C). The corresponding mass loss rate, water absorption, and compressive strength of the specimens at every 10 heat-rain cycles and 10 days were determined. The results show that the mass loss rate gradually increases with the increase in heat-rain cycles and the natural aging days. The variation range was found as about 0.2%similar to 0.7% and -0.4%similar to 0.2%, respectively. The water absorption rate gradually decreases with the number of heat-rain cycles and natural aging days; however, the decay rate of the water absorption rate differs by orders of magnitude in the two weathering conditions. The compressive strength does not have an obvious change with the number of heat rain cycles, but it first increases and then decreases with the number of natural aging days. Under artificial and natural aging, the deterioration mechanism and aging speed of expanded perlite mortar are much different.

A.",,,Estimation of NH3 emissions from a naturally ventilated livestock farm using local-scale atmospheric dispersion modelling,BIOGEOSCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agricultural livestock represents the main source of ammonia (NH3) in Europe. In recent years, reduction policies have been applied to reduce NH3 emissions. In order to estimate the impacts of these policies, robust estimates of the emissions from the main sources, i.e. livestock farms are needed. In this paper, the NH3 emissions were estimated from a naturally ventilated livestock farm in Braunschweig, Germany during a joint field experiment of the GRAMINAE European project. An inference method was used with a Gaussian-3D plume model and with the Huang 3-D model. NH3 concentrations downwind of the source were used together with micrometeorological data to estimate the source strength over time. Mobile NH3 concentration measurements provided information on the spatial distribution of source strength. The estimated emission strength ranged between 6.4 +/- 0.18 kg NH3 d(-1) (Huang 3-D model) and 9.2 +/- 0.7 kg NH3 d(-1) (Gaussian-3D model). These estimates were 94% and 63% of what was obtained using emission factors from the German national inventory (9.6 kg d(-1) NH3). The effect of deposition was evaluated with the FIDES-2D model. This increased the emission estimate to 11.7 kg NH3 d(-1), showing that deposition can explain the observed difference. The daily pattern of the source was correlated with net radiation and with the temperature inside the animal houses. The daily pattern resulted from a combination of a temperature effect on the source concentration together with an effect of variations in free and forced convection of the building ventilation rate.

The FTPP, however, has been challenged by a considerable amount of recent findings on vertebrate ectotherms, indicating that the FTP is not as static as originally postulated but can be modulated by various factors. In contrast to vertebrates, evidence from invertebrate ectotherms is far more limited. To test for the validity of the FTPP and to study whether behavioral thermoregulation in a marine invertebrate varies seasonally, thermal preferenda of the common brown shrimp (Crangon crangon, L.) were determined through a 14 month period. Thermal preferenda of males and females of different size groups were measured in an annular chamber system (4-25 degrees C) using the gravitational method for thermal preference testing. The results revealed that brown shrimp behaviorally selected a wide range of temperatures and did not show a single or constant thermal preferendum. Thermal preference was modulated following a seasonal pattern suggesting the existence of distinct seasonal preference zones rather than a species-specific preference temperature. Brown shrimp selected low temperatures during winter, however, a difference of 5 degrees C in preferred temperature was observed between a cold and a relatively mild one. Highest thermal preferenda did not coincide with field water temperatures but were observed after field water temperatures exceeded the annual temperature peak. Besides season, body size of brown shrimp significantly affected thermal selection and small individuals selected higher temperatures compared to large ones. A significant interaction of body size and water temperature at which the shrimp were caught was detected. The study further provides evidence that cohort identity as well as female reproductive state may affect thermal preference as well. The results of the study reveal that thermal selection in brown shrimp is complex, not static and that preference temperature can be modulated by various factors, representing the first evidence for a marine invertebrate ectotherm.

Further, to determine the effect of passive rewarming on torpor bout duration and active rewarming (i.e., the use of metabolic heat to increase T-skin), we experimentally shaded seven birds during winter to prevent them from passively rewarming via solar radiation. Poorwills selected winter roosts that were open to the south or southwest, facilitating passive solar warming in the late afternoon. Shaded birds actively rewarmed following at least 3days of continuous torpor. Average torpor bout duration by shaded birds was 122h and ranged from 91 to 164h. Active rewarming by shaded birds occurred on significantly warmer days than those when poorwills remained torpid. One shaded bird remained inactive for 45days, during which it spontaneously rewarmed actively on eight occasions.

Management practices, however, can be poorly efficient when the disturbances they introduce install environmental conditions that are similar to the ones under which the undesirable species evolved. Ulex parviflorus is a Mediterranean obligate seeder with physical dormancy forming large amounts of highly combustible standing necromass. In the present study, combining field and laboratory experiments, we determined the seedling recruitment of this species under different management practices (burning, mechanical clearing, slash/no slash on soil surface), we measured the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and moisture) enforced by these practices and we tested their individual and combined impact on germination in order to determine the most appropriate control method for this species. Germination is low under intact canopies, but it is strongly stimulated by both brush-chipping and fire. This is partly related to the inhibiting effect of the low red:far-red ratio of the light filtered by the canopy which is removed by brush-chipping and fire. The other factor involved is moderate heat, either fire-generated or resulting from solar radiation on bare soil, which breaks seed coat impermeability. Indeed exposing seeds on bare soil in summer resulted in a significant increase in their germination capacity and germination was reduced when the brush chips remained on the soil. Moisture fluctuations did not enhance germination. The summer heat impact affects management practices. When the brush-chipping treatment occurred before summer, the germination flush appeared the following autumn, but when the treatment occurred after summer, the germination flush did not appear until the autumn of the subsequent year, when interspecific competition with regenerating vegetation is likely to be more intense. We demonstrated that brush-chipping, especially when done after summer, is a better technique than fire for controlling U. parviflorus because it creates environmental conditions that are less favourable for its germination. This technique also has the potential to favour late-successional species less vulnerable to fire. By combining fuel reduction and land restoration, this technique is useful to the sustainable management policies that need to be developed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Biomass increased with increasing N supply. There was no net growth after mid-November. The number of tillers in rye and of appeared leaves in radish were higher in N2 than in N1. Leaf appearance rate increased with temperature in fodder radish and rye. Tillering in rye ceased in mid-October. Leaf lifespan was related to the temperature sum between leaf emergence and leaf death. Leaf lifespan was 478 +/- 68 degrees C day in fodder radish. In rye, the leaf lifespan gradually decreased from 592 +/- 66 to 389 +/- 25 degrees C day and from 545 (1 observation) to 401 +/- 64 degrees C day in N1 and N2, respectively. In young leaves, A(max) (light-saturated CO2 assimilation rate) was approximately 1.2 mg CO2 m(-2) leaf s(-1) in September and 0.5 mg CO2 m(-2) leaf s(-1) later on, independent of species and N supply. N supply affected the organic N concentrations only in the older leaves. A(max) was not dependent on temperature at measurement (range: 12-19 degrees C in September: 5-15 degrees C from November until March), but, in contrast, strongly related to temperature and irradiance during the preceding growth period. Leaf nitrate concentrations increased with N supply. Water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations were higher in N1 than in N2 and higher in rye than in fodder radish. They fluctuated during the season.

This model predicts that the ability to acclimate thermal sensitivity should evolve when temperature varies greatly among generations.

We also conducted germination experiment in laboratory for the six pioneer species to test the effects of red:far-red (R:FR) light ratio and temperature fluctuations on the seed germination. In conifer forests, the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), the R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations in thinned stands were 2, 1.5, and 3 times higher, respectively, than those of unthinned stands. The PPFD and R:FR ratios just above forest floor also increased after the removal of thick litter accumulation. As a result, higher seed germination was observed in thinned compared to unthinned stands for three photoblastic species, whereas little differences were observed for three non-photoblastic species. These findings suggest that thinning, which frequently reduces litter accumulation, can substantially affect the regeneration of pioneer species and the resultant species diversity in conifer plantations. None of the measured environmental signals changed seasonally in unthinned stands of conifer forests, but they all changed remarkably in the understory of the hardwood forests. in this system, all signals were high and nearly identical to those in the gaps in early spring prior to canopy closure. Thus, the percent germination of the three photoblastic species was enhanced by high R:FR ratios and/or large temperature fluctuations even beneath the canopy and was nearly equal to that in the thinned conifer stands where the environmental conditions were nearly identical to those in the gaps. However, all of the environmental signals decreased with the expansion of canopy leaves and reached minimums at canopy closure. Even in the thinned stands and the gaps, the PPFD and magnitude of temperature fluctuations decreased over time due to shading by growing herbs and/or emerging canopy leaves. In these temporally changing environments, the germination of all photoblastic species ceased simultaneously. This study clearly demonstrated that the environmental signals inducing seed germination of photoblastic pioneer species spatially and temporally change in temperate forests, particularly in deciduous hardwood forests. Furthermore, these signals, PPFD, R:FR ratio, and the amplitude of temperature fluctuations, appear to play a very important role in tree regeneration and subsequent species diversity.

Thus, the ability to behaviorally and/or physiologically respond to variation in temperatures is a fundamental requirement for long-term persistence. Studies on thermal biology in ectotherms are typically performed under constant laboratory conditions, which differ markedly from the variation in temperature across time and space in nature. Here, we investigate evolutionary adaptation and environmentally induced plastic responses of Drosophila simulans to no fluctuations (constant), predictable fluctuations or unpredictable fluctuations in temperature. We whole-genome sequenced populations exposed to 20 generations of experimental evolution under the three thermal regimes and examined the proteome after short-term exposure to the same three regimes. We find that unpredictable fluctuations cause the strongest response at both genome and proteome levels. The loci showing evolutionary responses were generally unique to each thermal regime, but a minor overlap suggests either common laboratory adaptation or that some loci were involved in the adaptation to multiple thermal regimes. The evolutionary response, i.e., loci under selection, did not coincide with induced responses of the proteome. Thus, genes under selection in fluctuating thermal environments are distinct from genes important for the adaptive plastic response observed within a generation.

The system can measure water temperature, water depth, dissolved oxygen, and value. Moreover, three infrared distance sensors were attached to the aquarium glass at different heights to monitor the group activity of fish. Continuous water depth sensing in the rearing tank can be used to monitor the ebb-and-flow irrigation and calculate the flowrate of water circulation. By using the fish activity sensing to determine if the fish are at rest, the dissolved oxygen and water temperature at fish's resting states are collected, then based on the established oxygen transfer rate model in this study, the systemic metabolic rate and fish's locomotion-induce metabolic rate can be calculated through the daily regression analysis. Fish activity sensing is a proactive measuring method compared with the measuring of dissolved oxygen and pH value, it has the advantage of immediacy and can technically be used to cross check whether the reading of dissolved oxygen or pH sensor near feeding time is within a reasonable range. The measuring module incorporating sensors and sub-1 GHz communication can transmit data to a 1-km-long gateway module. Finally, the data are uploaded to ThingSpeak (TM), a cloud platform, through Wi-Fi. By using the data stored on the cloud, a real-time alarm system for indicating abnormalities is developed and a periodic regression analysis is conducted using the cloud-based programming of ThingSpeak (TM).",,,,,,"Wang, Yu-Jen/0000-0003-1229-3368",,,,,,,,,,,,,0144-8609,1873-5614,,,,AUG,2020,90,,,,,,,,102067,10.1016/j.aquaeng.2020.102067,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2020.102067,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000551834300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few studies have quantified seasonal changes in the effects of elevated [CO2] on canopy evapotranspiration, which integrates the response of stomatal conductance of individual leaves with other responses, such as leaf area expansion, changes in leaf surface temperature, and changes in developmental stages, in field conditions. We conducted a field experiment to measure seasonal changes in stomatal conductance of the uppermost leaves and in the evapotranspiration, transpiration, and evaporation rates using a lysimeter method. The study was conducted for flooded rice under open-air CO2 elevation. Stomatal conductance decreased by 27% under elevated [CO2], averaged throughout the growing season, and evapotranspiration decreased by an average of 5% during the same period. The decrease in daily evapotranspiration caused by elevated [CO2] was more significantly correlated with air temperature and leaf area index (LAI) rather than with other parameters of solar radiation, days after transplanting, vapor-pressure deficit and FAO reference evapotranspiration. This indicates that higher air temperatures, within the range from 16 to 27 degrees C, and a larger LAI, within the range from 0 to 4m(2)m(-2), can increase the magnitude of the decrease in evapotranspiration rate caused by elevated [CO2]. The crop coefficient (i.e. the evapotranspiration rate divided by the FAO reference evapotranspiration rate) was 1.24 at ambient [CO2] and 1.17 at elevated [CO2]. This study provides the first direct measurement of the effects of elevated [CO2] on rice canopy evapotranspiration under open-air conditions using the lysimeter method, and the results will improve future predictions of water use in rice fields.",,,,,"Hasegawa, Toshihiro/H-8211-2019","Hasegawa, Toshihiro/0000-0001-8501-5612; Shimono, Hiroyuki/0000-0002-7328-0483",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,AUG,2013,19,8,,,,,2444,2453,,10.1111/gcb.12214,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12214,,,,,,,,23564676,,,,,WOS:000328744900012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Litter-bags with barley straw were buried in all treatments at 10 cm depth on 19 May 1988 and sampled five times during the growing season. Decomposition rates were calculated assuming exponential decay. The rates were highly dependent on soil moisture, and the constants ranged from 0.54% day-1 in D to 0.92% day-1 in IF. A simulation model with driving variables based on Q10 temperature dependence and a log-linear relationship between soil water tension and activity was fitted to the same data set. The rate constants became quite similar between the four treatments, ranging from 1.1 to 1.3% optimum day-1. Thus it was concluded that the assumptions and parameters used for temperature and moisture dependence were valid. Roots collected from each of the four treatments on four occasions were put in litter-bags, buried in the soil and taken up after about 20 days. Observed root decomposition rates were lowest in D. The rates for all treatments were highest early in the growing season and decreased thereafter. When temperature and moisture effects were compensated for using the climatic correction factors for barley straw, the decreasing trend remained, which was attributed to reduced decomposability of the roots during the growing season. The results indicate that using a constant value for root decomposability when calculating root turnover can give misleading results.",,,,,"Rajkai, Kálmán/B-3724-2014","Andren, Olof/0000-0002-9817-6308",,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0717,1879-3428,,,,AUG,1992,24,8,,,,,727,736,,10.1016/0038-0717(92)90246-T,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0717(92)90246-T,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JJ14100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The biomass accumulation of the short-duration cultivar was smaller than that of the long-duration cultivars, but the yield potential was similar. This was achieved by the production of similar number of florets per m2, despite smaller biomass at flowering, and greater harvest index. Only early-sown treatments resulted in smaller yield of the short-duration cultivar due to restricted biomass accummulation and floret production. A simple biological model of post-anthesis growth, which included the effect of low temperature, predicted growth with an accuracy similar to that of the measurements. The low temperature function assumed growth stopped following a daily minimum temperature below a specified threshold, and the number of days without growth was a function of the severity of the temperature.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of alkaline pretreatment using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and biomass fly ash for the composting of Samanea saman. The experimental detail consists of seven runs, that is, control; 1%, 2%, and 3% NaOH treatments; and 6.2%, 12.4%, and 12.4% biomass fly ash treatments. The pretreatment was conducted by mixing of NaOH and fly ash with green waste for 2 d and transferring the mixture to be composted in 55-L polystyrene thermo cooler boxes. The composting was performed for 105 d. The temperature was recorded daily and the compost characteristics were analyzed every 7-14 d. The highest maximum temperature was found in the NaOH treatment. However, the mean temperatures of all the experiments were not significantly different. The initial C/N ratios of the waste for all the runs ranged from 51.11 to 54.90 before continually decreasing/increasing to be in the range of 42.64-65.28 at the end of the experiment. The high C/N ratio of the end compost in the alkaline treatment might be attributed to the high initial C/N ratio and the N loss that resulted from the high pH of the compost material. The results of the lignin mass reduction show that 1-2% NaOH and 6.2% fly ash treatments can reduce lignin 2 times better than the control. However, higher doses of alkaline matter can increase the nitrogen loss due to volatilization of ammonia in the higher pH condition. In order to enhance the decomposition of green waste and minimize the nitrogen loss in the composting process, the pretreatment by 6.2% of fly ash can be selected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Studying such effects in natural settings is complicated by the fact that topography also affects microclimate and thus decomposition, so that effects of diversity are more difficult to isolate. Here, we quantified decomposition rates of standard litter in young subtropical forest stands, separating effects of canopy tree species richness and topography, and quantifying their direct and micro-climate-mediated components. Our litterbag study was carried out at two experimental sites of a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning field experiment in south-east China (BEF-China). The field sites display strong topographical heterogeneity and were planted with tree communities ranging from monocultures to mixtures of 24 native subtropical tree species. Litter bags filled with senescent leaves of three native tree species were placed from Nov. 2011 to Oct. 2012 on 134 plots along the tree species diversity gradient. Topographic features were measured for all and microclimate in a subset of plots. Stand species richness, topography and microclimate explained important fractions of the variations in litter decomposition rates, with diversity and topographic effects in part mediated by microclimatic changes. Tree stands were 2-3 years old, but nevertheless tree species diversity explained more variation (54.3%) in decomposition than topography (7.7%). Tree species richness slowed litter decomposition, an effect that slightly depended on litter species identity. A large part of the variance in decomposition was explained by tree species composition, with the presence of three tree species playing a significant role. Microclimate explained 31.4% of the variance in decomposition, and was related to lower soil moisture. Within this microclimate effect, species diversity (without composition) explained 8.9% and topography 34.4% of variance.

Acclimation is enabled to a large degree by phenotypic plasticity, the extent of which confers a selective advantage, especially in natural habitats. Certain key events in evolution triggered adaptive bursts necessary to cope with drastic environmental changes. One such event was the colonization of land 400-500 million years ago. Compared with most aquatic habitats, fluctuations in abiotic parameters became more pronounced, generating significant selection pressure. To endure these harsh conditions, plants needed to adapt their physiology and morphology and to increase the range of phenotypic plasticity. In addition to drought stress and high light, high temperatures and fluctuations thereof were among the biggest challenges faced by terrestrial plants. Thermomorphogenesis research has emerged as a new sub-discipline of the plant sciences and aims to understand how plants acclimate to elevated ambient temperatures through changes in architecture. While we have begun to understand how angiosperms sense and respond to elevated ambient temperature, very little is known about thermomorphogenesis in plant lineages with less complex body plans. It is unclear when thermomorphogenesis initially evolved and how this depended on morphological complexity.

We have tested whether such relationships could account for the natural variability in elongation rates of taproot and secondary roots of sunflower (from 2 to 135 mm d-1), in field and laboratory conditions. Elongation of taproot and secondary roots was recorded daily through windows in the field. A range of PPFD was obtained by following day-to-day natural fluctuation for three contrasting growing periods, and by shading part of the plants under study. A parallel experiment was carried out in a growth chamber with contrasting light intensities and with a (CO2)-C-14 labelling experiment. After the two-leaf stage, i.e. when the contribution of photosynthetic carbon became appreciable in root growth, daily root elongation rate was closely linked to the PPFD intercepted from 36 to 12 h before the measurement of root elongation. Curvilinear relationships applied to plants grown in the field as well as in a growth chamber, and to shaded plants as well as to plants subjected to day-to-day changes in intercepted PPFD. For a given intercepted PPFD, the taproot elongated faster than secondary roots, and secondary roots originating near the base of the taproot elongated faster than those originating near the apex. The elongation rate of any secondary root apex was accounted for (r = 0-77) by the ratio of intercepted PPFD to the distance between the apex and the base of the taproot. No relationships between intercepted PPFD and elongation rate were observed before the two-leaf stage, when the CO2 labelling experiment suggests that carbon essentially originates from the seed. Therefore, this study suggests a role for source-sink relations in the distribution of elongation between apices and a role for carbon nutrition in day-to-day variations of root elongation rate.

Treated adults were marked and released into field cages, and reproductive output was compared with that of untreated control bees. Exposure to low temperatures during the pupal stage had mixed effects on reproduction and offspring characteristics. Females treated with fluctuating low temperatures were more likely to nest compared with control bees or those exposed to constant low temperature stress. Sublethal effects may have contributed to low nesting rates of bees exposed to constant low temperatures. Females from that group that were able to nest had fewer, larger offspring with high viability, suggesting a trade-off.

This is a computer-controlled, closed, null-balance greenhouse system consisting of 12 chambers with individual control of CO2 concentration and temperature. Carbon dioxide can be maintained in each chamber at concentrations from well below ambient (150-200-mu-l l-1) to more than 900-mu-l l-1. Air temperature can be fixed, set to track ambient, or can track ambient temperature with a specified offset allowing studies of the interaction of CO2 and temperature. Despite the complications involved in tracking a naturally fluctuating environment, the CO2LT system performs very well. Temperatures in individual chambers average within 1-degrees-C of ambient or target temperatures over a 24-h period and carbon dioxide concentration control rivals that of laboratory-based, control-environment systems. Photon flux density within the chambers is within 93% of ambient values. Comparison to unenclosed tundra indicates minimal chamber effects on depth of thaw, air, leaf, or soil temperatures, or net ecosystem CO2 flux. Chamber effects are generally small, and the experimental design allows separation and interpretation of treatment effects despite any unavoidable chamber effects. Both diurnal and seasonal patterns of net ecosystem CO2 flux can be accurately tracked with this system. Field measurements indicate net ecosystem CO2 loss under current environmental conditions, a possible response to recent climate change. Field measurements also indicate initial enhancement of net ecosystem CO2 uptake with elevated atmospheric CO2.

Regal) were exposed to ambient O-3 episodes at 14 sites in eight European countries in 1996, 1997 and 1998. The plants were grown according to a standard protocol, and the forage was harvested every 28 days for 4-5 months per year by excision 7 cm above the soil surface. Biomass ratio (NC-S/NC-R) was related to the climatic and pollutant conditions at each site using multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), Twenty-one input parameters [e.g. AOT40, 7-h mean O-3 concentration, daylight vapour pressure deficit (VPD), daily maximum temperature] were considered individually and in combination with the aim of developing a model with high r(2) and simple structure that could be used to predict biomass change in white clover. MLR models were generally more complex, and performed less well for unseen data than non-linear ANN models. The ANN model with the best performance had five inputs with an r(2) value of 0.84 for the training data, and 0.71 for previously unseen data. Two inputs to the model described the O-3 conditions (AOT40 and 24-h mean for O-3), two described temperature (daylight mean and 24-h mean temperature), and the fifth input appeared to be differentiating between semi-urban and rural sites (NO concentration at 17:00). Neither VPD nor harvest interval was an important component of the model. The model predicted that a 5% reduction in biomass ratio was associated with AOT40s in the range 0.9-1.7 ppm.h (mu l l(-1) h) accumulated over 28 days, with plants being most sensitive in conditions of low NOx, medium-range temperature, and high 24-h mean O-3 concentration.

Field experiments were carried out with a wide range of durum wheat cultivars (released in Spain from 1980 to 2009) and were conducted in different sites embracing a wide range of growing temperatures and water regimes at Aranjuez and Zamadueilas during three consecutive growing seasons (2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16) under rainfed and supplemental irrigation and at Coria for two consecutive seasons (2014/15 and 2015/16) under rainfed conditions alone. Grain yield increased with the year of release of cultivars at a rate of 24 kg ha(-1) y(-1) (0.44% y(-1)) from 1980 to 2003, with no clear additional improvements thereafter. The moderate grain yield improvement from 1980 and 2003 was associated with kernels m(-2) and kernels spike(-1), with an increase of 117 kernels m(-2) y(-1) and 0.24 kernels spike(-1) y(-1), respectively. Moreover, aerial biomass at harvest and grain nitrogen yield increased with the year of release of cultivars for the entire period. However, no differences were found for thousand kernel weight, number of spikes m(-2), days to heading, plant height, harvest index, canopy temperature depression, carbon isotope discrimination or grain nitrogen concentration. Overall, these results indicated that the rate of genetic progress in the yield of durum wheat in Spain after the Green Revolution has been low and has even stopped during the last decade, while no clear trend in some grain quality traits (TKW and grain N concentration) was recorded.

Gonadal maturity stages, increment width, and environmental factors were examined by means of a field enclosure experiment in Balik Pulau, Penang Island, Malaysia, from December 2011 to November 2012. Histological analysis of gonads showed that gametogenic activity of A. granosa occurred throughout the year, with maximum spawning activity observed from April 2012 to late June 2012 (15%-28%) in males and from March 2012 to late June 2012 (19%-44%) in females. Shell cross-section analysis showed that the increment widths of both sexes in the growing group (indeterminate and developing stages) and the spawning group (ripe and spawning stages) ranged from 35-57 to 8-17 mm, respectively. Seawater temperature and salinity recorded on a daily basis throughout the study period ranged from 22-33 degrees C and 29-31, respectively. A comparison of increment width and gonad development stages in different environmental conditions showed that shell growth in the growing group decreased when seawater temperature and salinity decreased slightly. In contrast, increment widths in the spawning group were much narrower and were influenced by energy consumption during ripe and spawning stages.

In addition, the response of GP and NPPOC to irradiance and water temperature were measured through in vitro experiments. NPEDOC was measured using C-13-tracer in both in situ and in vitro experiments. NPPOC:GP ratios determined from in situ experiments ranged from 0.24 to 0.73 (0.53 +/- 0.16, mean +/- SD) over the course of the year. NPEDOC:GP ratios ranged from 0.04 to 0.08 (0.06 +/- 0.02) in both in situ and in vitro experiments. Based on the results of the present study, daily carbon flow through phytoplankton within the water column in the euphotic zone of Lake Biwa was estimated as follows: ratios of NPPOC to GP and NPEDOC to GP were 53 and 7%, respectively. Algal respiration (R) accounted for 40% of GP. In addition, R in vitro experiments increased linearly along with increasing water temperature, while R in situ experiments did not.

However, the responses and potential feedbacks of the methane flux from peatlands on the QTP to changing freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) remain unknown. In this study, we collected peat soils from the Zoige peatlands, the largest peatland complex on the QTP, to examine methane emissions under simulated diurnal FTC scenarios. In incubation experiments of 15 days, two freeze-thaw temperature ranges of -5 to 4 degrees C (mild) and -15 to 4 degrees C (intense) were applied to two sets of peat soil samples, and each of them was characterized by 100% or 80% maximum water holding capacity (MWHC). The results showed that the peak of methane emission from the peat soil occurred after the first freeze-thaw cycle (FTC1), with the highest reaching a value of 0.103 mg kg soil(-1)center dot h(-1). Generally, the cumulative methane emissions were elevated by FTCs, and relative higher rates of methane emissions were found for the 2nd FTC to the 15th FTC, compared with those from low-altitude peatlands. Methane emissions were significantly correlated to the export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the activities of beta-D-cellobiosidase and phenol oxidase in various freeze-thaw conditions. This study highlights the importance of FTCs in stimulating methane emissions and implies that methane emissions during FTCs from high-altitude peatlands would increase under a warmer climate in the future.",,,,,"Chen, Huai/AAI-1024-2020; Chen, Huai/A-7418-2015","Chen, Huai/0000-0001-7650-289X; Chen, Huai/0000-0001-7650-289X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-6463,,,,MAR 31,2022,10,,,,,,,,850220,10.3389/feart.2022.850220,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.850220,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000788005100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of this research was to adapt the CROPGRO V4.0 growth simulation model in order to predict growth and tissue N concentration of bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) in response to daily weather, N fertilization, and harvest management. To remain consistent with other crops the model simulates, the source code was not modified. The model's species and cultivar files were modified for bahiagrass, based first on literature information, and secondly, on optimization against field data. Herbage growth and N concentration data from a 2-yr experiment at Ona, FL and a 3-yr experiment at Eagle Lake, TX were used for optimization and model testing. The model, with literature-based estimates of photosynthetic rate, temperature sensitivities, and tissue compositions, predicted growth and composition reasonably well, confirming that C and N balances can be predicted from literature-inputs. Optimization of temperature sensitivities and target tissue N levels improved predictability. Because CROPGRO was developed for annual grain crops, the model was not able to predict winter dormancy, nor could it predict regrowth from a reserve pool if all the foliage had been killed, as in a freeze. Simulations persist through the winter if the freeze-kill inputs are turned off, but this led to unsatisfactory (excessive) water and soil N uptake in late-winter and early spring when the real crop was dormant. While this version can be used with some cautions, we conclude that the CROPGRO source code must be modified to add a dormancy routine, add a stolon storage organ to allow regrowth, and include day length effects regulating partitioning of reserves to stolons.",,,,,,"Boote, Kenneth/0000-0002-1358-5496",,,,,,,,,,,,,0096-4522,,,,,,2004,63,,,,,,37,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000226859000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Root water uptake is a key process in the circulation of water in forest ecosystems. Until recently, water absorption by tree fine roots could not be measured in situ in undisturbed soil. 2. We present a new technique that allows continuous recording of the water absorption of fine root endings in mature stands without altering soil structure, hydrology or mycorrhizal infection. 3. The approach combines miniature sap-flow gauges mounted on small-diameter tree roots (3-4 mm) with a complete extraction and visual surface analysis of the adjacent absorbing fine root endings. This technique yields continuous data on water absorption per fine root surface area, and allows analysis of the spatial heterogeneity of root water uptake in the rhizosphere of forests. 4. We present the results of laboratory and field calibration experiments with Fagus sylvatica L. roots (3-4 mm), which show a good agreement between gauge flow data and synchronous gravimetric flow measurements for flows between 2 and >50 g h(-1) . Gauge readings were unreliable during low flows (<2 g h(-1) ) at night. In these periods, which cover approximate to10% of daily flow, we used an empirically derived linear relationship between root temperature difference and flow. 5. Measurements on F. sylvatica root endings during 10 summer days showed daily water absorption maxima ranging between 0.20 (rainy days) and 0.58 mmol m(-2) root surface area s(-1) (bright or overcast days). The corresponding daily maxima of leaf transpiration rate were approximate to10 times higher (2-4 mmol m(-2) leaf area s(-1) ). 6.

Burbot preferences were tested for (i) water depth, (ii) substrate size, (iii) water depth and substrate size combined, and (iv) water depth, substrate and flow velocity in combination. Diurnal and nocturnal activities were recorded and analyzed throughout all experiments. Burbots of both length groups showed a significant preference for deeper water depths and large cobble substrate. Substrate type was found to be the dominant factor determining habitat preferences of L. lota when investigated in combination with water depth. In experiments combined with flow velocity, substrate and water depth were the most important factors determining burbot habitat preferences, and flow velocity of minor importance.

Here, we examined seasonality and the effects of acute and chronic heat shock to 33 degrees C and subsequent recovery from heat shock on the ultrastructure of the superficial pectoralis muscle fiber diameter, myonuclear domain (MND) and capillary density in two temperate bird species of differing body mass, the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) and the rock pigeon (Columba livia). We found that muscle fiber ultrastructure did not change with heat treatment. However, in black-capped chickadees, there was a significant increase in fiber diameter in spring phenotype birds compared with summer phenotype birds. In rock pigeons, we saw no differences in fiber diameter across seasons. Capillary density did not change as a function of fiber diameter in black-capped chickadees, but did change seasonally, as did MND. Across seasons, as fiber diameter decreased, capillary density increased in the pectoralis muscle of rock pigeons.

New biophysical modeling methods (NicheMapR) allow the calculation of the body temperature of thermoregulating animals anywhere in the world from first principles, but require detailed observational data for parameterization and testing. Here we describe the thermoregulatory biology of marching bands of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, in the Sahara Desert of Mauritania where extreme heat and strong diurnal fluctuations are a major constraint on activity and physiological processes. Using a thermal infrared camera in the field, we showed that gregarious nymphs altered the microhabitats they used, as well as postural thermoregulatory behaviors, to maintain relatively high body temperature (nearly 40 degrees C). Field and laboratory experiments demonstrated that the preferred body temperature accelerated digestive rates. Migratory bands frequently left foraging sites with full guts before consuming all vegetation and moved to another habitat before emptying their foregut. Thus, the repertoire for behavioral thermoregulation in the desert locust strongly facilitates foraging and digestion rates, which may accelerate developmental rates and increase survival. We used our data to successfully parameterize a general biophysical model of thermoregulatory behavior that could capture hourly body temperature and activity at our remote site using globally available environmental forcing data.

Experiments were conducted over 3 years under ambient and elevated (+3 degrees C) temperatures to obtain parameter values for the growth model. Potato emergence is predicted to occur at 631 degree days accumulated above 0 degrees C after the 16-day running mean temperature in spring exceeds 0 degrees C.

However, the lack of research on the feeding strategy of this species is detrimental to its conservation management. The present study evaluated the effects of feeding frequency (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 times per day) on the growth performance, feed transit and digestive enzyme activity of juvenile Dabry's sturgeons (initial weight 0.42 +/- 0.09 g) in a continuous flow culture system at a water temperature of 18.2-18.5 degrees C. Single-meal and normal-feeding (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 times per day) experimental methods were adopted to assess the effect of different feeding frequencies on feed transit. The fish in each treatment of the normal-feeding experiment were fed normally according to the original feeding frequency (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 times per day). The optimum feeding frequency for juvenile Dabry's sturgeons was determined to be 4 times per day based on the growth performance, feed conversion rate and digestive enzyme activity. The results of the single-meal experiment demonstrated that changes in daily feeding frequency modified residence time in the stomach (S1-S5: 27.2-10.4 h) and intestine (S2-S5: range from 14 to 29.85 h). However, the obtained gastric emptying time varied significantly depending on the experimental approach. The single-meal experiment approach resulted in a longer gastric emptying time of fish fed 1 and 2 times per day (S1: >35 h; S2: 35 h) than those in the normal-feeding experiment (N1: 16 h; N2: 24 h), demonstrating that the single-meal method might change the gastrointestinal emptying strategy of fish. Furthermore, the digestive enzyme activity had daily rhythmic changes and the average digestive enzyme activity was affected by feeding frequency.

A wet season form has conspicuous marginal eyespots and a medial pale band which are much reduced in the dry season form. These alternative forms are produced after rearing at high or low temperatures, respectively. We used 'window' experiments involving switching of larvae and pupae between high and low temperatures at different stages during development to examine the timing of sensitivity to environmental temperature. The final, fifth larval instar is shown to be especially sensitive. The fourth larval instar and the very early pupal period are also sensitive. It is argued that an increasing sensitivity during growth is ecologically adaptive since the late larval environment will be the most accurate predictor for the adult environment in which the wing phenotype is subject to selection. The period of sensitivity is not as short as a few days. This may minimize the chance of any 'mistakes in matching the adult phenotype to the season because of short-term environmental fluctuations during the larval period. The observed sensitivity occurs as late as possible during growth since the wing pattern is developmentally determined at the end of the early part of the pupal stage. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The objective of this study was to evaluate M. lupulina emergence in response to burial depth and temperature and to model M. lupulina cumulative field emergence under subtropical Florida conditions using growing degree days (GDDs) as a predictor. Two studies were in controlled environments and looked at factors affecting emergence, burial depth, and temperature. A third experiment was a 2-yr emergence study conducted on four commercial strawberry fields in Hillsborough County, FL. Emergence was modeled as a function of accumulated standard and restricted daily GDD accounting, based on M. lupulina dormancy and germination. In Experiment 1, M. lupulina only emerged when seed was deposited on the surface. In Experiment 2, there was three-way interaction among temperature, burial depth, and measurement timing (P<0.0001). Medicago lupulina emerged from as deep as 2 cm at a temperature range between 15 and 25 C. Medicago lupulina field emergence was not consistent between years, although emergence was consistent across four sites in year 1, with 0 emergence in year 2. Dormancy and germination restrictions increased calibration and validation model fit and reduced GDD inflation, making models usable between years. Medicago lupulina primarily emerged during crop establishment, between mid-November and late-December, which corresponds to an ideal timing for control measures before the harvest period.",,,,,"Sharpe, Shaun M./L-6017-2019","Sharpe, Shaun M./0000-0002-7683-703X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1745,1550-2759,,,,MAR,2019,67,2,,,,,253,260,,10.1017/wsc.2018.69,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/wsc.2018.69,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000472582700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Base tick survival and development rates were obtained from laboratory-controlled experiments or calculated from reported data. These rates were modelled as temperature-dependant time delays or accumulated mortality by temperature and water VD stress. Using daily data derived from a gridded data set at 10-min resolution, the model reached stable and cyclical equilibria in an area that corresponds largely with the reported distribution of the tick in western Palearctic. The model did not identify a potential range of suitable climate for the tick out of the known distribution area, implying that under current climate conditions, there is no potential to spread at the spatial scale of the model. Tick die-out at northern latitudes was attributed to a steady increase in duration of the development rates of engorged nymphs to adults and hence increased mortality in this stage. Low developmental rates in northern latitudes produced the accumulation of most of the nymphal stock in late summer and early autumn, which cannot moult to adults because of the low temperatures of late autumn and winter. The tick did not produced self-sustained populations in areas where yearly accumulated temperatures were below 3000-4000 degrees C, a limit roughly found at latitudes north of 47 boolean OR N. Tick die-out in sites southern to 34 boolean OR N was attributed to the mortality rates of engorged nymphs, which moult in late spring and summer, in the season where temperatures and water vapour stresses were highest.

Leaf nonstructural carbohydrates were determined before sunrise and at sunset. Results showed that R-n could acclimate to nocturnal warming and diurnal warming, but R-d could not. The decreases in Q(10) (temperature sensitivity) of R-n under nocturnal-warming and diurnal warming regimes might be attributed to greater depletion of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC). The real-time and intertwined metabolic interactions between chloroplastic and mitochondrial metabolism in the daytime could affect the impacts of warming on metabolite pools and the distinct response of R-n and R-d to warming.

J,"Bassirirad, H",,,,"Bassirirad, H",,,Kinetics of nutrient uptake by roots: responses to global change,NEW PHYTOLOGIST,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is a growing recognition that accurate predictions of plant and ecosystem responses to global change require a better understanding of the mechanisms that control acquisition of growth-limiting resources. One such key mechanism is root physiological capacity to acquire nutrients. Changes in kinetics of root nitrogen (N) uptake might influence the extent to which terrestrial ecosystems will be able to sequester excesses in carbon (C) and N loads. Despite its significant role in determining plant and ecosystem cycling of C and N, there is little information on whether, or how, root nutrient uptake responds to global change. In this review various components of global change, namely increased CO2 concentration, increased soil temperature and increased atmospheric N deposition and their effects on kinetics of root nutrient uptake are examined. The response of root nutrient uptake kinetics to high CO2 is highly variable. Most of this variability might be attributable to differences in experimental protocols, but more recent evidence suggests that kinetic responses to high CO2 are also species-specific. This raises the possibility that elevated CO2 might alter community composition by shifting the competitive interaction of co-occurring species. Uptake of NH4+ and NO3- seem to be differentially sensitive to high CO2, which could influence ecosystem trajectory toward N saturation. Increased soil temperature might increase N and P uptake capacity to a greater extent in species from warm and fluctuating soil habitats than in species from cold and stable soil environments. The few available data also indicate that increased soil temperature elicits a differential effect on uptake of NH4+ versus NO3-. Root uptake kinetics are generally down-regulated in response to long-term exposure to atmospheric N deposition. The extent of this down-regulation might, however, vary among species, stages of succession, land-use history and plant demand. Nonetheless, it is suggested that root N uptake kinetics might be an accurate biological indicator of the ecosystem capacity to retain N. The results reviewed here clearly highlight the scanty nature of the literature in the area of root nutrient absorption responses to global change. It is also clear that effects of one component of global change on root nutrient absorption capacity might be counterbalanced by another. Therefore, the generalizations offered here must be viewed with caution and more effort should be directed to rigorously test these initial observations in future research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-646X,1469-8137,,,,JUL,2000,147,1,,,,,155,169,,10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00682.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00682.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088577900013,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we investigated how the abundance of total bacterial, crenarchaeal and fungal communities and the abundance of N-cycling microbial guilds responded to a severe agricultural drought event in a long-term experiment of minimum tillage (MT) and conventional ploughing (CT) at two soil depths. Drought, defined as a reduction of soil water content and increased soil temperature, significantly decreased the abundance of all the studied microbial communities. The data showed linear relationships between all dependent variables and soil water content and soil temperature for the examined range of soil water content (WHC 13-76%) and examined range of average daily soil temperature at 5 cm depth (17-30 degrees C). Thus, we found that the abundance of most studied microbial communities decreased by about 2% when water content decreased by 1 mass % and by about 10% when temperature increases by 1 degrees C. When comparing communities at average soil water content and average soil temperature, MT had higher average abundances of total bacterial and crenarchaeal 16S rRNA and fungal ITS genes in the 0-10 cm soil layer than did CT (1.9, 2.9 and 2.5 times, respectively), as well as AOA and AOB amoA (3.9 and 1.7 times, respectively), nirK, nirS, nosZI and nosZII genes (2.0, 1.8, 1.8 and 2.3 times, respectively); while significan/differences between MT and CT in the 10-20 cm soil layer were found only in the average abundance of crenarchaeal 16S rRNA and crenarchaeal amoA genes (3.5 and 2.7 times greater under MT than CT). Regardless of the weather conditions during our study, the abundances of all communities were greater under MT 0-10 than under CT 0-10. After three weeks of severe drought, the greatest decrease in the abundance of all communities, bacterial and archaeal N-cycling guilds as well as total prokaryotes and fungi, was observed under MT 0-10.

There is increasing interest in understanding the implications of biological invasions within the context of ecosystem functioning. Non-native crustaceans are of particular interest within fresh waters because of their important contributions to leaf-litter processing. The alien amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus is spreading rapidly through Europe where it has displaced native gammarids including Gammarus pulex. The resultant change in shredder communities has considerable implications for the dynamics of resource availability within invaded systems. 2. The invasive success of D. villosus has been attributed to many characteristics, including its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions and to exploit a wide feeding niche. These characteristics are thought to give D. villosus an advantage over native species, especially in habitats subject to changing environmental conditions. 3. The leaf (Salix alba) shredding efficiency, defined as the leaf mass consumed over the 4-day experiment per amphipod-day, was measured for D. villosus and G. pulex under extreme temperature and conductivity conditions, in single species and mixed species aquaria. 4. At high temperatures (25 degrees C), D. villosus shredded significantly more leaves than size-matched G. pulex. Conductivity extremes had no species effect; overall leaf-shredding efficiency was significantly greater at low conductivity (250 S cm(-1)) than high conductivity (1870 S cm(-1)). 5. An inspection of daily leaf disc consumption found that the two species showed significantly different leaf consumption patterns, with D. villosus consuming more leaves earlier in the experiment. 6. These results suggest that D. villosus invasion could lead to ecosystem-level changes in leaf processing, such as greater leaf processing earlier in autumn and at higher temperatures, which could alter nutrient dynamics and community assemblages within invaded systems. Such effects may not be reflected in biotic indices used to assess ecological status, as these indices do not currently distinguish between native and invasive species in the same family.

Fluctuations caused by climate change would inevitably affect the ecosystems' structure and functions. However, the linkage between cold biome ecosystems and global changes demonstrates high spatial heterogeneity, especially between high-latitude ecosystems (HL) and high-altitude alpine ecosystems (HA). A comparative analysis of their response patterns would provide deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms at play. We used meta-analysis to synthesize ecosystems' response to warming and altered precipitation performed in HL and HA. Warming and enhanced precipitation increases ecosystem biomass and carbon fluxes in HL and HA. Warming significantly stimulates aboveground biomass (AGB), root biomass (RB), total biomass (TB), aboveground net primary productivity, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), soil respiration (SR), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in HL and HA. Similarly, AGB, GEP, and NEP increase significantly with enhanced precipitation. Respondent of ecosystem carbon storage and fluxes in HL and HA showed diverse results to warming treatment. Warming increases AGB and RB in HA while RB remains unaltered in HL. GEP and ER exhibit a positive response to warming in HL but an insignificant response in HA. In general, HL is sensitive to warming, and HA is sensitive to precipitation. The differential responses of HL and HA to climate change imply specific ecosystem traits and particular environmental constraining factors.

Reliable information on potential future changes with high spatial resolution acquire significant importance for the development of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies for the region. In this context, regional climate models (RCMs) play a fundamental role. In this paper, the results of a set of sensitivity experiments with the regional climate model COSMO-CLM version 5.0, for the Central Asia CORDEX domain, are presented. Starting from a reference model setup, general model performance is evaluated for the present day, testing the effects of singular changes in the model physical configuration and their mutual interaction with the simulation of monthly and seasonal values of three variables that are important for impact studies: near-surface temperature, precipitation and diurnal temperature range. The final goal of this study is twofold: having a general overview of model performance and its uncertainties for the considered region and determining at the same time an optimal model configuration. Results show that the model presents remarkable deficiencies over different areas of the domain. The combined change of the albedo, taking into consideration the ratio of forest fractions, and the soil conductivity, taking into account the ratio of liquid water and ice in the soil, allows one to achieve the best improvements in model performance in terms of climatological means. Importantly, the model seems to be particularly sensitive to those parameterizations that deal with soil and surface features, and that could positively affect the repartition of incoming radiation. The analyses also show that improvements in model performance are not achievable for all domain subregions and variables, and they are the result of a compensation effect in the different cases. The proposed better performing configuration in terms of mean climate leads to similar positive improvements when considering different observational data sets and boundary data employed to force the simulations. On the other hand, due to the large uncertainties in the variability estimates from observations, the use of different boundaries and the model internal variability, it has not been possible to rank the different simulations according to their representation of the monthly variability.

Using GPS collars, tended goat herds from three villages in southern Morocco were studied. The aim was to characterise their spatio-temporal movement patterns, i.e. the seasonal variation in grazing intensities, and daily trajectories of the herds. Furthermore, the effect of recording interval on recorded daily walking distances and the relationship between grazing intensities and distance was assessed. Grazing intensities were calculated within 4-ha grid cells for areas around settlements. The highest grazing intensities were found in the 250 m nearest the settlement. Some directions were totally avoided due to either community boundaries or adverse topography. The daily and maximum walking distances were significantly different between seasons. In the arid ecosystems the longest mean daily walking distance were found to be in the spring whereas in semiarid ecosystems it was in summer. It is argued that this variation in grazing pattern is mainly driven by varying fodder availability and its nutritive value, weather conditions and the length of day. The distances were longer in periods when fodder of high nutritive value was available, while cold temperatures and short days in winter limited the distances walked. The relationship between GPS recording interval and recorded trajectory length was described well by an exponential function, which in turn allows extrapolation from data with longer intervals to the actual distances travelled. Using non-linear regressions, the decay of grazing intensity with increasing distance was described better with power functions. The exponents ranged from -1.69 to -2.18, demonstrating that the goats were clumped around the settlements.

As a consequence, the statistics of all observables is remarkably consistent. Here, we develop a statistical mechanics framework for living cells by including the homeostatic constraint that exists over the interphase period of the cell cycle. The consequence is the introduction of the concept of a homeostatic ensemble and an associated homeostatic temperature, along with a formalism for the (dynamic) homeostatic equilibrium that intervenes to allow living cells to evade thermodynamic decay. As a first application, the framework is shown to accurately predict the observed effect of the mechanical environment on the in vitro response of smooth muscle cells.

Thus, we argue that the observed variabilities are inherent to the entropic nature of the homeostatic equilibrium of cells and not a result of in vitro experimental errors.",,,,,"Deshpande, Vikram/O-3100-2019; Deshpande, Vikram/C-6750-2013; Shishvan, Siamak S/F-9331-2010; Vigliotti, Andrea/B-9230-2014","Deshpande, Vikram/0000-0003-3899-3573; Deshpande, Vikram/0000-0003-3899-3573; Shishvan, Siamak S/0000-0002-2945-2081; Vigliotti, Andrea/0000-0003-2591-1364",,,,,,,,,,,,,1617-7959,1617-7940,,,,DEC,2018,17,6,,,,,1631,1662,,10.1007/s10237-018-1048-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10237-018-1048-1,,,,,,,,29987699,,,,,WOS:000452359300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The extracellular (haemolymph) concentrations of potassium ions increased with significantly higher rates in the insects exposed to constant low temperatures than in those exposed to FTRs. The concentrations of magnesium and sodium ions were maintained relatively constant or decreased slightly in both thermal regimes. The loss of body water and the increase of haemolymph osmolality contributed to, but could not fully explain, the ion concentration changes, which probably resulted also from impairing the function of an active metabolic component (ion pump) at low temperatures. This explanation was supported by observing (in P apterus) the return toward normal [K(+)] during the warm recovery period of the FTR. Collectively, the paper stresses the importance of considering the temperature fluctuations in the experimental studies on insect cold tolerance and suggests that the positive effect of the FTR on cold tolerance may consist, at least partially, in allowing the primary ion pumping systems to re-establish the ion gradients across cell membranes and epithelia during the recovery periods at a higher temperature.

L.; Khaliq, Tasneem; Ahmad, Ashfaq",,,Predicting methane emissions from paddy rice soils under biochar and nitrogen addition using DNDC model,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Methane (CH4) is a second largest contributor of global warming after carbon dioxide (CO2), and it is crucial to understand how management practices affect CH4 emissions. Among field crops, paddy rice alone has accounted for about 10-12% of the total CH4 emission in 2010. The process-based DeNitrification and DeComposition (DNDC) model can be applied to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural soils. Capturing both the daily time-scale and cumulative growing season CH4 fluxes by DNDC may help to devise appealing mitigation approaches for better rice management. In this study, DNDC was calibrated with a parameter-adjustment approach under two treatments: 140 kg N ha(-1) without biochar and 140 kg N ha(-1) with 2% bio -char. Simulation results show that the model predicted the daily CH4 fluxes in good agreement with measure-ments under both treatments. Next, DNDC was validated with the adjusted parameters against the remaining biochar and N treatments, and the model performed well in prediction of CH4 fluxes as indicated by several statistical indexes: RMSE ranged from 6.74 to 7.62 g CH4 ha(-1)d(-1), the D-index varied between 0.92 to 0.98, and MPD and nRMSE were at 10.94-17.43% and 17.54-24.52%, respectively. In terms of cumulative growing season CH4 efflux, DNDC under-simulated all treatments except the control. Further DNDC predicted above-ground dry weights and volumetric water contents in good agreement with the measurements. Moreover, model poorly predicted soil temperature, pH, and soil moisture content. The value of the D-index varied from 0.12 to 0.38 for both soil temperature and pH. Subsequently, DNDC successfully identified the significant impact of biochar on CH4 emission, and model error was strongly correlated with pH of soils with no biochar amendments. In conclusion, the DNDC model can capture the daily time-scale as well as annual-scale CH4 fluxes, though DNDC must be validated by intensive measurements of additional soil variables, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial composition under different biochar types.",,,,,"Muhammad, Sher/GLR-8293-2022; Muhammad, Sher/GXG-3264-2022; Maas, Ellen/GYD-3491-2022","Muhammad, Sher/0000-0002-0769-5066; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,,,APR,2022,466,,,,,,,,109896,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.109896,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.109896,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000779142200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Herbage quantity and quality peak in summer when it is lush and green, but is dry and withered in winter when it is scarce and of poor quality. Traditionally, yaks graze only natural pasture all year without supplements and have adapted well to the extreme winter conditions. Grazing behaviour has been used as an indicator for grazing management decisions and, in this study, was measured in five 4 to 8 years old yak cows suckling calves during summer and winter on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. The diurnal behavioural patterns were similar in the two seasons. Grazing time and jaw movements per hour increased at dawn (07:00), remained relatively steady and then decreased at dusk (19:00), whereas ruminations, mastications and boluses per hour exhibited an opposite trend and decreased at dawn, and then increased after dusk. Seasonally, with a decrease in herbage quality from summer to winter, yaks decreased grazing and ruminating times and walking distance (P < 0.05) and increased drinking and idling times (P < 0.05). Air temperature was the primary meteorological variable affecting yak behaviour and was correlated positively with grazing time, ruminating time, the rate of mastications while ruminating, boluses formed and mastications per bolus (P < 0.05). In addition, wind velocity and precipitation significantly influenced the grazing behaviour of yaks (P < 0.05). We concluded that both meteorological and forage conditions affected the grazing behaviour of yaks and that the general reduction in grazing activities in winter could have been a strategy to reduce exposure to the harsh conditions and, consequently, reduce energy expenditure for foraging and for thermoregulation.",,,,,"Ding, Lu/ABF-8526-2020; Jing, Xiaoping/GQA-3866-2022","Ding, Lu/0000-0001-8087-2738; Jing, Xiaoping/0000-0003-1759-9366",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1591,1872-9045,,,,SEP,2019,218,,,,,,,,104826,10.1016/j.applanim.2019.06.007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2019.06.007,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000500193200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

A series of laboratory and greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the effect of various environmental factors on germination of musk thistle seeds. In temperature-fluctuation experiments, seed germination was greater than 65% in both alternating (30/20 C) and constant (20 or 25 C) temperature regimes with an 8-h day but less (33%) in warmer regimes (35/20 C). Germination of musk thistle seeds was 37% in alternating temperature regimes of 30/20 C in total darkness, but less than 67% in pots in the greenhouse. Differences of 10 and 15 C between day and night temperatures resulted in 91 and 75% maximum germination of musk thistle, respectively. Increasingly dryer soils reduced germination of musk thistle seeds from 35% (-0.03 MPa) to 0% (-1.2 MPa), whereas saline soils (> 80 mM) reduced maximum germination to less than 10%. Musk thistle seeds collected from populations in a bare-ground area had 96% germination, which was greater than that of seeds collected from populations growing in a perennial grass pasture (71%). A residence time (i.e., period that seeds remained on the parent plant) of 9 to 12 wk after capitulum maturity resulted in seeds germinating more quickly than those dispersed earlier. Overall, reduced light levels, cool and fluctuating temperatures, and amount of time seeds remained in residence are some of the most important factors that contribute to germination of musk thistle seeds. Information on germination dynamics of musk thistle seeds provides an understanding of the interactions that affect this process and underscores the importance of timely management strategies in temperate grasslands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1745,,,,,OCT-DEC,2013,61,4,,,,,549,556,,10.1614/WS-D-13-00015.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WS-D-13-00015.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000325782600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two experimental groups were fed granulated feed for trout Kliba Forrelenfutter (Kliba Klingentalmuhle AG, Basel, Switzerland) with 0.5% supplement of probiotics Ascogen. Two control groups were fed the same feed for trout but without adding the probiotics. Experiment were conducted with four laminated silos of the effective volume of water 150 liters. Silos were included in the circulation system with biological purification of water by means of dipped filters. The flow provided exchange of water in silos once an hour. Average water temperature was 23.2-degrees-C, average content of dissolved oxygen in water in individual silos was ranging from 5.0 to 6.3 mg.l-1. Aeration was in all silos ensured by compressed air dispersed by ceramic cylinders. All four silos were stocked with 34 sheat fish in each at the age of 1.5 of the average fish weight 99.1 g. Initial total biomass was uniform in all silos, that is 3.370 g per silo (i.e. 22.5 g.l-1). The complete trial was divided in three partial periods, each persisting 16 days. In the day of stocking, or in subsequent day followed the last feeding day of each partial feeding period, the fish were not fed. In these days depletion of stock was carried out along with its weighing and determination of the number of fish. On the basis of the value found, average fish weight gains, biomass weight gains, feeding coefficient (FQ) and specific growth rate (SGR) were calculated in different tanks. For the following partial feeding periods on the basis of actual biomass after substitution of the daily feed ration (2.0 %.day-1) and predicted FQ (1.3), actual daily feed ratios, considering biomass gain, were calculated. These daily feed rations were fed in seven partial daily rations between 7 a.m. to 12 a.m. FQ values in different partial feeding periods were ranging from 1.78 to 3.41 in control groups in five cases, in one case this was 6.40. Average value for all partial feeding periods in both control groups were 3.01 +/- 1.76.

Thus, variation of P uptake parameters was evaluated with a series of depletion studies for poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) and marigold (Tagetes patula) under fluctuating climatic conditions and different developmental stages. Relative growth rate (RGR) of marigold was higher than that of poinsettia and declined for both crops with plant age. Lower air temperature reduced the RGR of poinsettia, but not of marigold. However, the lower light intensity reduced the RGR of marigold while it had no effect on the RGR of poinsettia. A short photoperiod reduced the RGR of poinsettia. Maximum uptake rate also decreased with plant age and with decrease of air temperature for both poinsettia and marigold; however, it was independent of light intensity. Maximum uptake rate of poinsettia was lower during short photoperiod than that of longer photoperiod. A close correlation between RGR and I(max) was observed with both poinsettia and marigold throughout all treatments. The K(m) and C(min) were affected neither by plant age, air temperature, light intensity nor by day length. However, higher I(max), but lower K(m) and C(min) values were observed for marigold than for poinsettia during all treatments. The required P availability in the substrate was not much affected by short term fluctuations of growing conditions and photoperiod. However, it was clearly reduced with plant age for both crops which should be considered for fertilization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Experiments were carried out at four different planting dates in the Aegean region of Turkey during 2004 and 2005. The experimental design was a split-plot design with three replications. Planting date affected emergence, beginning of flowering, beginning gynophore formation, primary branch number, primary branch length, days to maturity and pod yield. Pod yield was significantly correlated with the primary branch length, GDD, sunshine radiation during gynophore formation, time to maturity and days from emergence to flowering. The Aegean climate has a long growing period and is a suitable environment for peanut growth. Peanut cultivars are exposed to suitable temperature regimes and sunshine during the vegetative and reproductive growth stages in the early and normal planting dates in the Aegean region. On the contrary, the peanut cultivars planted in the late planting stage were negatively affected in the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. The peanut cultivars were stressed in the late planting because of the shortened growth period and unsuitable growing conditions. Early planting, ranging from May 5 - 20, provided the essential 1450 and 1600 degrees C GDD and 893 - 978 h of sunshine during the reproductive stage for peanuts grown in the Aegean region.

Twenty-four groups of juveniles (initial weight 57.6 (SD 14.4) g) were intensively reared for 116 d and fed sixteen different isoproteic diets. The distribution of the experimental treatments was based on a multivariate fractional factorial design (L-24 2(12)) with either high (+ l) or low (- l) level of each of the following factors: diet (lipid and protein Sources, lipid content, astaxanthin enrichment), feeding level, daily and weekly distribution frequency, fish density, initial weight heterogeneity, temperature, photoperiod, and light spectrum. Liver lipid droplets, glycogen, mitochondria and rough endoplastuic reticulum (RER) were semi-quantified and analysed by a soft imaging system using transmission electronic microscopy photographs.

It describes the development of a dynamic model for thermal transient analysis and its application to a simplified test case considering solar irradiation and internal radiation. The dynamic behavior of the indoor air temperature has been investigated by means of a lumped approach using a state-space representation developed in MATLAB/Simulink. A set of daily temperature profiles, which are representative of the Mediterranean climatic condition, on a few different winter days, has been used as boundary conditions for the dynamic simulations. In addition, the model has been validated using two different sets of experimental data available in the literature, both statically and dynamically. Finally, a layer of insulation with a phase change material (PCM) is applied to the single zone building to quantify its effect on the building's behavior. The results showed that the rate and amount of energy consumption in the building with PCM are moderately lower than the building without PCM. In addition, the variation of inlet air temperature, solar effects, and energy consumption have been evaluated for a case study example, as well as comfort in transient simulation to achieve a complete evaluation of the test building investigated. A satisfactory agreement was obtained between the experimental and the simulation results and shows that the model can be used for a wide range of materials, dimensions, thermal resistances, and boundary conditions.",,,,,"Fateh, Amirreza/M-6186-2019; Borelli, Davide/B-2125-2013; Devia, Francesco/I-4535-2012","Borelli, Davide/0000-0002-4601-7794; Devia, Francesco/0000-0003-1109-0032; fateh, amirreza/0000-0001-6420-6022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-3417,,,,MAR 1,2019,9,5,,,,,,,832,10.3390/app9050832,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app9050832,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000462504400019,View Full Record in Web of Science

PROTOCOL I mimicked changes in the natural environment from winter to spring when ovarian maturation and spawning in Penaeus merguiensis starts. PROTOCOL 2 evaluated whether a clear improvement of temperature from a fluctuation period to a stable one could help trigger ovarian maturation. In phase A (first 30 days) of the experiment, temperature and day length were gradually increased from 22 to 27 degreesC and from 10 to 14 h, respectively, while light intensity was stepwise reduced from 360 to 240, 120 and 5 1x for PROTOCOL 1. For PROTOCOL 2, light intensity and day length were manipulated as for PROTOCOL 1, but temperature was cycled from 22 to 27 degreesC every 3 days. In phase B (the following 30 days) temperature, light intensity and day length were stably maintained at optimal levels (27 degreesC, 5 1x and 14 h light, respectively). During phase B, the proportion of female prawns reaching stages III and IV was significantly (P<0.05) highest in PROTOCOL I and lowest in the CONTROL. Of the total spawns by unablated females recorded in this phase, 55.6% was in PROTOCOL 1, 33.3% in PROTOCOL 2 and only 11.1% in the CONTROL. Mass spawning was induced by unilateral eyestalk ablation on day 60. Spawning performance of prawns were monitored for a further 21-day period (phase C). Overall, PROTOCOL 1, PROTOCOL 2 and the CONTROL produced 2.36, 1.96 and 1.53 million eggs, respectively. The latency period of spawners was shortest (P<0.05), whereas the proportion of spawners, fecundity, spawning rate and egg production/female were all improved in PROTOCOL 1. An improvement of prawn growth was observed in PROTOCOL 2. This study suggested that environmental manipulation could improve ovarian maturation and spawning rate of pond-reared P. merguiensis.

The relevance of the study is driven by the need to analyze changes in the considered parameters under short-term climate changes in the isolated forest steppe of the Nazarovskaya Depression. The study involved generally adopted methods, e.g., landscape geochemical, comparative analytical, comparative geographical, and statistical methods. The maximum moisture reserves were found in meadow-wetland soil, and the minimal reserves were found in meadow-chernozem leached soil. The values were close for ordinary chernozem of the meadow subtype and its anthropogenic modification (fallow), which can be attributed to their location in the relief and hydrothermal regime. It was experimentally established that ordinary chernozem of the meadow subtype (in situ) features a temperature curve with a steeper slope, lower freeze temperatures, and a longer period with negative temperatures than meadow-wetland soil. New knowledge was obtained on the change in the reserves of water-soluble forms of calcium, magnesium, organic and inorganic carbon, moisture content, and fluctuations of climate parameters, e.g., air temperature and total precipitations.

The covariance between the environment and competition this generates leads to compensatory population dynamics, now thought to be important for community stability. We tested this theory experimentally using freshwater diatoms. We measured the growth of Cyclotella pseudostelligera and Fragilaria crotonensis over a range of temperatures. Cyclotella showed a higher growth rate and higher silicate assimilation rate between 6 degrees C and 18 degrees C, while Fragilaria showed greater competitive ability above 18 degrees C. These results were used to parameterize a resource competition model. Numerical simulation of this model predicted stable coexistence and compensatory dynamics under fluctuating but not constant temperature.

Despite temperature fluctuations in the various compartments external and internal to a concrete wall, the vegetated cladding reduced interior temperatures and delayed the transfer of solar heat, which consequently reduced power consumption in air-conditioning compared with a building envelope with bare concrete. Vegetation cover led to a different pattern of temperature fluctuations on wall surfaces, which may affect the comfort of occupants even after sunset. The cooling effect which was closely associated with the area covered by living plants and moisture in the growth medium, demonstrated the value of maintaining a healthy vegetation cover beyond visual amenity. Marked variation in moisture distribution along the vertical profile of the growth medium highlighted a concern rarely addressed in planting on ground.

On the micro-scale, heat can induce substantial changes in the air temperature (Ta) at the pedestrian height. To characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of the Ta for spaces adjacent to the underlying surfaces, an accurate measurement method is essential. This study explored the proper spatial interpolation methods (SIMs) through strategically-arranged measurement points and then assessed the spatiotemporal distribution of Ta in a tiny experimental area. Results showed that the selection of SIMs and interpolation points significantly affected the results for the micro-scale spatial interpolation. The Ta might fluctuate precipitously within extremely short distances between adjacent underlying surfaces, depending on their thermal properties or on the locations of shadows. At the pedestrian height, the Ta readings registered a maximum difference of 1.31 C for the same areas with and without arbor shading. However, the arbors' cooling extent and location depended on their shading's position, which constantly changed during the day. The shrubs and the lawn under direct sunlight hardly regulated the microclimate, even in the periphery.

We conducted an incubation experiment with a factorial design of two mean temperatures (24 vs. 28 degrees C) and three diel thermal fluctuations (0, +/- 3, +/- 6 degrees C) to determine the effects of diel thermal fluctuations and mean temperature on incubation duration and hatchling phenotypes. Both diel thermal fluctuations and mean temperature significantly affected incubation duration, but not hatching success. Incubation duration increased with increasing temperature fluctuations at a mean temperature of 24 degrees C, but not at a mean temperature of 28 degrees C. The significant interaction between diel thermal fluctuations and mean temperature on hatchling morphology indicated that the effect of thermal fluctuations depended on the mean temperature. Hatchling mass differed significantly between 24 +/- 6 and 28 +/- 6 degrees C, but not between the two constant temperatures or the temperatures with +/- 3 degrees C fluctuations. At a mean temperature of 24 degrees C, the effect of thermal fluctuations on hatchling size was marginally significant, with relatively large hatchlings at the constant temperature; at a mean temperature of 28 degrees C, thermal fluctuations had no impact on hatchling size. The locomotor performances were significantly affected by mean temperature rather than diel thermal fluctuations.

Sardine larvae collected inshore of the Kuroshio front originated from a coastal area near the sampling site, while those collected in the offshore area originated from an area 500-800 km west-southwest of the sampling site. Anchovy larvae collected both inshore and offshore had been transported from widely distributed spawning areas located west of the sampling area. At the age of 13-14 days for sardine and 19-20 days for anchovy, the offshore group exhibited significantly higher mean growth rates than did the inshore group. Although the offshore area was generally warmer than the inshore area, temporal variations in growth rate are not attributable solely to fluctuations in environmental temperature. While previous studies have examined the relationship between larval growth rates and environment based solely on data at capture, the methods used in the present study, combining otolith analysis and numerical particle-tracking experiments, utilize data up until hatching.

The basis of our calculations is an assumption of an effective potential with multiple local minima. In particular, we consider a quartic potential in place of the simple quadratic. We then use non-Gaussian statistics to obtain a relationship between the mean square displacement and model parameters. We compare our model to published experimental data and show that it can describe the data set using physically meaningful parameters which are fitted to the experimental data. In the process we verify the Gaussian approximation's applicability only to the low-temperature regime. In the high-temperature limit, however, deviations from the Gaussian approximation are due to the double-well nature of our effective potential.

We examined the feeding behavior of subyearling Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and its relation to growth by estimating the functional response of juvenile salmon to changes in the density of Daphnia, an important component of reservoir food webs. We then estimated salmon growth across a broad range of water temperatures and daily rations of two primary prey, Daphnia and juvenile American shad (Alosa sapidissima) using a bioenergetics model. Laboratory feeding experiments yielded a Type-II functional response curve: C = 29.858 P *(4.271 + P)(-1) indicating that salmon consumption (C) of Daphnia was not affected until Daphnia densities (P) were < 30 . L-1. Past field studies documented Daphnia densities in lower Columbia River reservoirs of < 3 . L-1 in July but as high as 40 . L-1 in August. Bioenergetics modeling indicated that subyearlings could not achieve positive growth above 22 degrees C regardless of prey type or consumption rate. When feeding on Daphnia, subyearlings could not achieve positive growth above 20 degrees C (water temperatures they commonly encounter in the lower Columbia River during summer). At 16-18 degrees C, subyearlings had to consume about 27,000 Daphnia . day(-1) to achieve positive growth. However, when feeding on juvenile American shad, subyearlings had to consume 20 shad . day(-1) at 16-18 degrees C, or at least 25 shad . day(-1) at 20 degrees C to achieve positive growth. Using empirical consumption rates and water temperatures from summer 2013, subyearlings exhibited negative growth during July (-0.23 to -0.29 g . d(-1)) and August (-0.05 to -0.07 g . d(-1)). By switching prey from Daphnia to juvenile shad which have a higher energy density, subyearlings can partially compensate for the effects of higher water temperatures they experience in the lower Columbia River during summer. However, achieving positive growth as piscivores requires subyearlings to feed at higher consumption rates than they exhibited empirically.

Changes in climate were directly applied to observations (the delta change method) assuming that the estimates of climate change are reliable even if the simulated current climate may be biased. The ensemble average for the mid-century (1946-1965) predicted 0.7% increase in daily precipitation (monthly variation from -11.3% to +19.5%) and 2.78 degrees C increase in average temperature over the entire watershed. These predictions were translated through a well-calibrated SWAT modelling setup into 22% decrease in snowfall, 16% decrease in surface runoff, 18% decrease in baseflow, 8% increase in evapotranspiration and 17% decrease in total water yield. The spatial impact at the subwatershed level revealed a wide variation (but no defined trend) with decrease in water yield that ranged from 10% to 23%.

Stored and non-stored shoots were compared for microcutting production, harvested twice at 3-wk intervals, and were subsequently transferred to the greenhouse for 17 d. Nearly all plants from 16-wk storage survived well at all treatment conditions and the quality and quantity of microcuttings were enhanced from shoots stored at 15 degrees C and 3% (w/v) sucrose, without mannitol for all storage periods. Another experiment tested 11- to 25-wk storage period with Petunia hybrida 'Ragtime' and 'Suncatcher' at 12 degrees C and low light intensity. Repeated cycles of microcutting at 2-wk intervals were extended with ex vitro rooting in the greenhouse for 15 d. More and better quality microcuttings were obtained from the second and third cutting cycles than from the first or fourth cycles. By reducing temperature and light intensity, Petunia hybrida was successfully stored for 32 wk (without mannitol). A seasonal schedule with a short production window, followed by cutting large numbers of high-quality shoot-tips, could be affected and efficiently managed through storage.

Flooding and grazing are disturbances forming gaps that may strongly influence recruitment patterns in space and time, but their combined effects and action mechanisms have rarely been addressed. In this study we analysed the effects of microhabitat conditions associated with winter flooding and spring-summer defoliation on seed germination and seedling establishment of Paspalum dilatatum, a dominant perennial C(4) grass in native grasslands of the Flooding Pampa, Argentina. The dynamics of seedling emergence from natural seed banks and buried seeds was studied in a factorial experiment with flooding and defoliation treatments applied to soil monoliths (mesocosms) collected from natural grassland. Additional laboratory experiments were applied to investigate seed germination under different combinations of temperature, light quality and simulated flooding. Seed germination and seedling emergence of P. dilatatum were promoted by flooding and high intensity defoliation. Gaps generated by flooding were maintained by high intensity defoliation exercising a synergistic effect on survival seedlings. Flooding resulted in the breaking of seed dormancy and higher germination rates associated with alternating temperature and the activation of the phytochrome system. Our results indicate that microhabitat conditions associated with the disturbances forming gaps, such as flooding and heavy grazing, synergistically promote the recruitment process of this dominant grass species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1442-9985,,,,,MAY,2009,34,3,,,,,343,350,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01935.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2009.01935.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000265222000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, stage frequency data were generated with B. tabaci in sweet pepper plants in various situations, and the Bellows and Birley method was used to obtain population parameters from the data. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to select the best option of the Bellows and Birley method and, in some cases, to estimate the parameters of the population using model averaging. The ratios estimated/observed for each population parameter were calculated to assess bias and were used to correct the estimations if the ratios were different from 1. The effects of different factors on the estimations of population parameters were analysed. The total duration of development was affected by the experimental conditions (laboratory vs. greenhouse) and temperature, but it had the highest precision. The final survival rate was affected by temperature, and the estimation of individuals entering each stage was affected only by the options included in the Bellows and Birley method.

Efficient and accurate methods are required to analyze large metabolic networks. Flux sampling can be used to explore the feasible flux solutions in metabolic networks by generating probability distributions of steady-state reaction fluxes. Unlike other methods, flux sampling can be used without assuming a particular cellular objective. We have undertaken a rigorous comparison of several sampling algorithms and concluded that the coordinate hit-and-run with rounding (CHRR) algorithm is the most efficient based on both run-time and multiple convergence diagnostics. We demonstrate the power of CHRR by using it to study the metabolic changes that underlie photosynthetic acclimation to cold of Arabidopsis thaliana plant leaves. In combination with experimental measurements, we show how the regulated interplay between diurnal starch and organic acid accumulation defines the plant acclimation process. We confirm fumarate accumulation as a requirement for cold acclimation and further predict gamma-aminobutyric acid to have a key role in metabolic signaling under cold conditions. These results demonstrate how flux sampling can be used to analyze the feasible flux solutions across changing environmental conditions, whereas eliminating the need to make assumptions which introduce observer bias.",,,,,"Schwartz, Jean-Marc/AAS-8274-2020","Schwartz, Jean-Marc/0000-0002-6472-0184; Vass, Lucy/0000-0002-2644-7850; Herrmann, Helena/0000-0001-9008-0726; Johnson, Giles Nicholas/0000-0003-1536-5582",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2056-7189,,,,SEP 2,2019,5,,,,,,,,32,10.1038/s41540-019-0109-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41540-019-0109-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000496188100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experiments were conducted from 2012 to 2014 in Clayton, NC and Charleston, SC, where disease-free potted plants were exposed to weather conditions during a 24- and 48-h period (hereafter 24- and 48-h models, respectively) within a plot with naturally occurring inoculum. Exposed plants were subsequently placed in a growth chamber where they were monitored for disease symptoms, which was indicative of a successful infection. Disease severity was assessed after 7 days as the proportion of leaf area with disease symptoms. Two predictor variables, day temperature and hours of relative humidity >80% during each exposure were used as inputs to generate model predictions that were compared with observed data. The threshold probability on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve that minimized the overall error rate for the 24-h model was 0.85 for both squash and cantaloupe. The 24-h model was consistently more accurate than the 48-h model in predicting the infection risk for the two hosts. The accuracy of the 24-h model as estimated using area under ROC curie ranged from 0.75 to 0.81, with a correct classification rate ranging from 0.69 to 0.74 across the two hosts. Specificity rates for the model ranged from 0.81 to 0.84, while the sensitivity rates ranged from 0.58 to 0.67. Optimal decisions thresholds (Par) developed based on estimates of economic damage and costs of management showed that Par was dependent on the probability of disease occurrence, with the benefit of using the 24-h model for making management decisions being greatest at low levels of probability of disease occurrence.

J,"Tercek, MT; Whitbeck, JL",,,,"Tercek, MT; Whitbeck, JL",,,Heat avoidance life history strategy controls the distribution of geothermal Agrostis in yellowstone,ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two Agrostis taxa occur in geothermal habitats of Yellowstone National Park: Agrostis rossiae is reported to be endemic to the thermal areas and A. scabra occurs both in thermal and nonthermal habitats. Thermal populations of both taxa are always surrounded by a nonthermal population of A. scabra that is reproductively. isolated from the thermal plants by its later flowering time (summer rather than spring). Since Agrostis species are well known for their ability to form edaphic ecotypes, we used common garden and greenhouse experiments to test the hypothesis that soil type (a complex variable including factors such as soil chemistry and soil biotic community) was responsible for the separation of the thermal and nonthermal populations. In addition, field monitoring and growth chamber experiments were used to determine whether soil temperature affected the local distribution of these taxa. The results indicate that the thermal and nonthermal taxa are affected similarly by both soil temperature and soil type. The separate distribution of the thermal and nonthermal taxa is not due to the greater tolerance of one of these taxa for a particular factor, but instead to the interaction between seasonal fluctuations in soil temperature and the life history of the thermal and nonthermal plants. Nonthermal Agrostis plants, which are perennial, are excluded from the thermal habitats by lethal summer soil temperatures that limit the duration of the growing season, effectively selecting for precocious flowering and an annual habit. The thermal plants, in contrast, do not grow in the nonthermal matrix in prevailing cool field temperatures, but do grow in these habitats under artificially elevated temperatures. The thermal taxa may have reduced competitive ability at cooler temperatures. Thermal Agrostis have adopted a stress avoidance strategy, unlike previously studied thermal plants in Yellowstone, e.g., Dicanthelium lanuginosum, which are stress tolerant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JUL,2004,85,7,,,,,1955,1966,,10.1890/03-0392,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-0392,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000223113500028,View Full Record in Web of Science

The shad + formulated bait combination was effective in attracting crawfish over a wide range of water temperatures from February through May. In the bait quantity trial, both gizzard shad and the formulated bait were evaluated singly at 113 g/trap, 150 g/trap, 227 g/trap, and 340 g/trap from February through May.

With the exception of formulated bait in cool water, crawfish CPUE generally increased with an increase in bait quantity with both baits; however, bait margin did not differ among bait quantities, indicating that the additional revenue associated with increased catch did not compensate for the increased cost of bait.

Experiments to examine the importance of diel variation in upper mixed layer populations were conducted in July-August 1990 and March 1991. During July-August 1990, P-max(B) and I-k showed significant increases and alpha(B) decreased during the photoperiod in both river plume and shelf-slope populations. During March 1991, no consistent covariance of P-I parameters with local time was found, although highest values of alpha(B) in the river plume were observed in early morning. Seasonal variation in P-max(B), and alpha(B) were correlated with temperture. Spatial variations of photosynthetic parameters in the upper mixed layer ranged from twofold to threefold within any given cruise. Variations of photosynthetic parameters in the upper mixed layer were related to principal components derived from environmental variables, including temperature, salinity, nutrients, mixed layer depth, attenuation coefficient, and daily photosynthetically available radiation (PAR). Greater than 70% of the variation in the environmental variables could be accounted for by two principal components; the majority of this variation was associated with the first principal component, which was generally strongly correlated with salinity, nutrients, mixed layer depth, and attenuation coefficient. Correlations of P-max(B), alpha(B), and I-k with the first principal component were found to be significant in some cases, an indication that spatial variability in P-I parameters was related to river outflow. Variation of P-I parameters in relation to depth and PAR were evaluated by regressions with principal components derived from depth, temperature, and mean daily PAR. For most cruises, P-max(B), and I-k were negatively correlated with the first principal component, which was strongly positively correlated with depth and negatively correlated with daily PAR. This was consistent with a decrease in both P-max(B), and I-k with depth that could be related to decreasing daily PAR. Positive correlations of alpha(B) with the first principal component for two cruises, March 1991 and April 1992, indicated an increasing trend with depth. In conclusion, relationships between P-I parameters and environmental variables in the region of study were significant in some cases, but variation between cruises made it difficult to generalize. We attributed this variation to the physically dynamic characteristics of the region and the possible effects of variables that were not included in the analysis such as species composition.

The interaction between an internal seed dormancy mechanism and the ruling environmental conditions allows accurate cueing of germination. We analysed how environmental signals interact in seeds of temperate forest pioneer species, increasing the seeds chances of germinating in the right place at the right time. Digitalis purpurea and Scrophularia nodosa are two small-seeded herbaceous species that typically grow in vegetation gaps in European temperate forests. Seeds of both species are partially dormant at the time of dispersal in summer. This primary dormancy is released in autumn and early winter, resulting in a minimal level of physiological dormancy by late winter and early spring. We observed that physiological dormancy was induced again in seeds exhumed in late spring and in summer. Experiments in laboratory conditions revealed that primary dormancy in seeds of S similar to nodosa was broken by cold stratification, whereas primary dormancy in D.similar to purpurea seeds was broken by both a cold and a warm stratification. The two species differed in their response to the tested gap-detection signals, as light was the most important factor stimulating germination of D.similar to purpurea, and seeds of S.similar to nodosa germinated best when subjected to daily fluctuating temperatures. This study clearly indicates that the ability to germinate in response to gap-detection signals changes seasonally in temperate forest pioneers. Additionally, seeds of both species responded differently to these environmental signals, probably reflecting differences in the regeneration niche.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1435-8603,1438-8677,,,,MAY,2012,14,3,,,,,481,490,,10.1111/j.1438-8677.2011.00515.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1438-8677.2011.00515.x,,,,,,,,22188020,,,,,WOS:000302299600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a standard, the variety 'VNIIMK 620' was sown. The experiments were laid on sod-podzolic medium loamy soil in the grain-grass rotation after winter crops during 2012-2015. During the years of research, the plow layer of the experimental plots had different humus contents - medium and high, mobile phosphorus and exchange potassium - medium and very high, exchange soil acidity - slightly acidic and close to neutral. To a greater extent, by 91.5%, the change in the seed yield of the studied oil flax varieties depended on the abiotic conditions of the growing season; the share of the influence of the genotype of the variety in the formation of seed yield was 3.0%. Meteorological conditions during the years of the experiments were characterized by large fluctuations in the average daily air temperature and the amount of precipitation that fell over the months, in consequence of this the seed yield of flax oil varied in wide range over both varieties and years of study. The most favorable abiotic conditions for the formation of oil flax seeds were formed in 2014, when, during the ripening period of the seeds optimal meteorological conditions have developed with hydro thermic factor of 1.0. This contributed to obtaining the highest seed yield in 2014 - 218 g/m(2). On average, over four years of research, the same response to abiotic conditions with seed yield was formed in 'VNIIMK 620' varieties from Russia, 'Clark' varieties from Holland and 'Barbara' from Hungary.

However, the climate effects of aerosols through carbon cycle feedback still have significant uncertainties. Taking advantage of the periodic fluctuations of aerosol loading in Beijing, we intensively measured the diurnal course of leaf microclimates and photosynthesis under different aerosol conditions during the growing season in 2014 and 2015. We found that increasing aerosol loadings altered the diurnal course of microclimates and thus sun and shade leaf photosynthesis. Our mechanistic photosynthesis model experiments further showed that aerosol-induced increase in sun leaf photosynthesis occurred around noon and afternoon, mainly by alleviating the depression of photosynthesis caused by high leaf temperature and leaf-air vapour pressure deficit. Meanwhile, aerosols enhanced shade leaf photosynthesis throughout the day by mitigating the light limitation within the canopy, with the highest increase occurring around noon. Overall, our study suggested that aerosol's diffuse fertilization effect, cooling effect and the accompanying low leaf-air vapour pressure deficit collectively drove the changes in the diurnal courses of sun and shade leaf photosynthesis. Our results provided an important benchmark for assessing how anthropogenic aerosols regulate ecosystem C balance under different meteorological conditions.",,,,,,"Liu, Lingli/0000-0002-5696-3151",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-7791,1365-3040,,,,OCT,2022,45,10,,,,,2943,2953,,10.1111/pce.14411,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.14411,,AUG 2022,,,,,,35906794,,,,,WOS:000837021300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Four different percentages of dietary leaf extract powder of Aleo vera (ALE) with a basal feed, designated as, i.e., T0 (Control group; without ALE), T1 (1% ALE), T2 (2% ALE), and T3 (3% ALE). Fish fry was reared in concrete tanks (7.0 m, 1.6 m, 1.0: L, W, H; water volume 11.2 m3/tank), with an average initial weight 4.04 +/- 0.03 g/ fry, and each treatment was triplicated. Fry was randomly distributed at a stocking rate of 450 individuals/ tanks. The water quality parameters revealed that temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrates were found in a promising range as given by FAO/WHO limits. However, the record values obtained for Electric Conductivity (EC), Total dissolved solids (TDS), and alkalinities were not found in all tanks' suitable range according to FAO/WHO limits. The results revealed a significant impact of different percentages of dietary ALE supplementation on fry's body composition and haematological parameters. Moreover, the final body weight, final body length, average daily weight gain (g), net weight gain (g) and specific growth rate (%) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in T1 and T2 compared with T0 and T3 treatments. The poorest feed conversion ratio was recorded in the T2 group compared with other treatments.

In PILPS Phase 4(b), selected schemes are coupled to the Limited Area Prediction System (LAPS) developed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. To facilitate the comparison of PILPS schemes' behavior within LAPS, a single mode of coupling is selected: explicit coupling. This type of coupling is more flexible and avoids most of the problems raised when interchanging the surface schemes. Exploratory tests are conducted. Initially, experiments are run in which the land-surface schemes use the same parameters as in their original host models. Then, in other runs, the most important surface parameters are set constant in an attempt to reduce the scatter amongst the schemes' results. In order to understand the impact of initialisation of soil moisture on the schemes' results some extreme cases (wet and dry) are performed. The partitioning between surface fluxes is studied as well as the soil moisture budget. Both regional and local results are analysed. Sensitivity between LSS is found in the precipitation field with rainfall over the Australian continent altering by about 20%, but no significant change is found in the net radiation. The scatter in the surface energy fluxes amongst the schemes is large (up to 300 W m(-2) locally, during the daytime peak) but is seldom affected by the choice of surface parameters. The dynamical range of flux partitioning between extremely dry and wet initialisation varies strongly amongst the schemes. Some major shortcoming with the BUCKET approach are seen in the re-evaporation of convective precipitation over dry land, in the very large evaporation from wet surfaces and the diurnal cycle of surface temperature.

Jay; Bergeron, Normand",,,Multi-day anchor ice cycles and bedload transport in a gravel-bed stream,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"River dynamics in cold regions and the physical processes involving ice formation and release remain relatively understudied topics. Current research suggests that anchor ice forms in diurnal cycles and has the potential to move sediments when released from the bed. Given the importance of river ice dynamics, studies are needed to describe the physical processes of anchor ice and its impact on sediment transport. The study presented in this paper investigated in situ anchor ice formation on the Stoke River in Quebec, Canada. In the fall of 2012, we observed multi-day anchor ice formation cycles and release, which usually ended with a small runoff event. During a cycle, there was little or no release of anchor ice, thus allowing its gradual growth as the air temperature remained cold. Surface and anchor ice layers also often merged, leading to the formation of thick ice masses. Sediment transport was monitored using bed particles individually tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT-tags). Movement of the experimental particles, measured after each multi-day cycle event, ranged from 0.5 to 4 m. Possible transport mechanisms include: (1) anchor ice rafting, (2) ice jam breakup creating a jave with high erosive capacity, (3) flow corridors through anchor ice masses with high erosive capacity, (4) mechanical pushing of particles by drifting ice blocks during ice breakup, and (5) entrainment by flow or drifting ice blocks of anchored ice with strong ice-pebble bonds. Given the coincidental occurrence of anchor ice release and runoff events, it is uncertain which specific mechanism caused the particles to move. This study is a step forward in understanding the behavior of anchor ice processes and ice-related sediment transport. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the electrical and thermal energy needs of health centers constructed with local building methods and materials and operating outside of the jurisdiction of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) codes is complicated by a lack of appropriately scaled and configured energy system design frameworks and validation data for dynamic simulations. In this work we address this gap by linking the thermal envelope performance of health center buildings under heating and cooling loads with measured indoor air temperature, meteorological conditions, and operational electricity demand. A resistance-capacitive type energy balance model is para-meterized using typical health center architectural data for sub-Saharan Africa (floor plans from Uganda and Lesotho) and heat transfer characteristics; to achieve this energy flows between HVAC equipment, internal loads, and ambient conditions are simulated on an hourly time step with indoor temperature thresholds representative of thermostat settings. A typical meteorological year dataset for Lesotho is used as a case study, validated with indoor temperature measurements and power metering at four health center sites spanning a daily patient load ranging from 15 to 450 per day over rural and urban communities. High resolution electricity measurements from smart meters installed at the clinics are used to close the energy balance and form the basis of a probabilistic method for forecasting long term hourly electricity demand in African health centers. These data and the corresponding method have relevance to energy system design for health clinics across sub-Saharan Africa, especially those featuring intermittent renewable generation. The integration of these two modeling approaches constitutes a novel tool for sizing and costing energy infrastructure to meet operational demand at health centers in both urban and rural areas of developing countries.",,,,,"Lemort, Vincent/AAE-7059-2019","Lemort, Vincent/0000-0002-0654-8435; /0000-0002-0408-5393",,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,MAY 15,2018,218,,,,,,382,390,,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.004,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000430994500032,View Full Record in Web of Science

Germination was strongly stimulated by light and warm fluctuating temperatures, suggesting high emergence of Chinese sprangletop on bare ground such as a crop seedbed. A high level of germination (95%) immediately after seed hat-vest Suggests that the soil seed bank of this species could be depleted by stale-seedbed strategies. Seed burial depth in soil strongly influenced emergence of this weed, and no seedlings emerged from seeds buried at depths of >= 0.5 cm. Maximum emergence (80%) from seeds placed on the soil surface suggests that no-till practices would enhance the emergence of seedlings. Seedling emergence from surface-sown seeds was similar (80 to 82%) between saturated and aerobic-moist soil, demonstrating that this weed does not require a saturated soil and that it can emerge from a moist soil. Flooding, even though nor continuous or deep, had a suppressive effect on the emergence and dry matter of Chinese sprangletop.

Arcto-Norwegian cod (AC, the main commercial cod stock which spawn in Lofoten and are distributed in the Barents Sea, mostly north of 70 degrees N), were compared with a nearby coastal stock (Balsfjord cod, BC - from a fjord near Tromso at 69 degrees 30'N), and a more southern coastal cod stock (CC, from near Bergen at 60 degrees N). The increment width series of the lapillus - otolith growth history - and the relative daily growth rate were not significantly different among stocks within any mesocosm. Although AC larvae were larger, being derived from larger brood stock, they did not exhibit consistently greater otolith growth during the experiment. Larger size at harvest was correlated with growth during the latter part of rearing (>fourth week), which is when most differences in size at age are generated. Decreases in daily increment widths occurred in all stocks within 1-2 days, when the zooplankton food supply was changed from nauplii and copepodites to adult copepods, and when the average AC cod began to exhibit greater dairy growth. Increment widths of reared AC cod at 37 days post hatch (>8 mu m) were 2-3 times greater, and ontogenetically more variable than those of similar sized cod previously sampled from the Barents Sea (3-4 mu m). Average otolith growth histories of pelagic juvenile cod reveal a substantial range in growth potential that is not apparent from more conservative comparisons of weight, and reveal a temporal sensitivity useful for the assessment of environmental fluctuations in the rearing process.

Arctic land surface temperatures and precipitation are predicted to increase further, likely causing major transformation in terrestrial ecosystems. As a response to increasing temperatures, shifts in vegetation and soil fungal communities have already been observed. Little is known, however, how long-term experimental warming coupled with increased snow depth influence the trajectories of soil fungal communities in different tundra types. We compared edaphic variables and fungal community composition in experimental plots simulating the expected increase in summer warming and winter snow depth, based on DNA metabarcoding data. Fungal communities in the sampled dry and moist acidic tundra communities differed greatly, with tundra type explaining ca. one-third of compositional variation. Furthermore, dry and moist tundra appear to have different trajectories in response to climate change. Specifically, while both warming and increased snow depth had significant effects on fungal community composition and edaphic variables in dry tundra, the effect of increased snow was greater. However, in moist tundra, fungal communities mainly were affected by summer warming, while increased snow depth had a smaller effect and only on some functional groups. In dry tundra, microorganisms generally are limited by moisture in the summer and extremely low temperatures in winter, which is in agreement with the stronger effect of increased snow depth relative to warming. On the contrary, moist tundra soils generally are saturated with water, remain cold year-round and show relatively small seasonal fluctuations in temperature. The greater observed effect of warming on fungi in moist tundra may be explained by the narrower temperature optimum compared to those in dry tundra.",,,,,"Geml, Jozsef/C-2223-2018","Geml, Jozsef/0000-0001-8745-0423",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-302X,,,,MAR 12,2021,12,,,,,,,,628746,10.3389/fmicb.2021.628746,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.628746,,,,,,,,33776958,,,,,WOS:000632641900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The 1000 km-long transect, from 56degreesN to 68degreesN, passed through tundra, taiga and pine forest characteristic of Northern Russia. Soil microbial properties were characterized by dehydrogenase activity, microbial biomass, composition of microbial community (PLFAs), respiration rates, denitrification and N mineralization rates. Relationships between vegetation, latitude, soil quality (pH, texture), soil organic carbon (SOC) and the microbial properties were examined using multivariate analysis. In addition, the temperature responses of microbial growth (net growth rate) and activity (soil respiration rate) were tested by laboratory experiments. The major conclusions of the study are as follows: 1. Multivariate analysis of the data revealed significant differences in microbial activity. SOC clay content was positively related to clay content. Soil texture and SOC exhibited the dominant effect on soil microbial parameters, while the vegetation and climatic effects (expressed as a function of latitude) were weaker but still significant. The effect of vegetation cover is linked to SOC quality, which can control soil microbial activity. 2. When compared to fine-textured soils, coarse-textured soils have (i) proportionally more SOC bound in microbial biomass, which might result in higher susceptibility of SOC transformation to fluctuation of environmental factors, and (ii) low mineralization potential, but with a substantial part of the consumed C being transformed to microbial products. 3.

It has an extensive root system, which competes both directly and indirectly with summer and winter pastures and crops through depletion of soil moisture and nutrients. Long-distance dispersal of seeds is an important mechanism for its spread and management. A range of experiments was conducted to determine the factors influencing seed production and seedbank dynamics. Seed production ranged from 1,814 to 2,945 m(-2). Diurnally fluctuating temperatures of 25/15 C provided the optimal thermal conditions for germination, with germination not affected by light. Osmotic stress reduced germination, with no germination occurring at -1MPa. Germination was reduced to 5% at 160 mM NaCl, suggesting some salt sensitivity. Germination occurred over a pH range of 4 to 10, but declined with increasing acidity. Viability of buried seed declined to around 20% after 3 yr, with seed buried at 10 cm remaining the most viable. The prolonged seed persistence in the soil indicates a long-term control program is necessary for depleting the soil seedbank.",,,,,"Wu, Hanwen/B-7901-2010","Wu, Hanwen/0000-0001-5157-4977",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1745,1550-2759,,,,JAN-MAR,2012,60,1,,,,,42,47,,10.1614/WS-D-11-00105.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WS-D-11-00105.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000299668200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Bacterial intrinsic growth rates and grazing loss rates were estimated from dilution experiments. Growth limitation due to resource availability was determined from nutrient addition experiments. Measured bacterial intrinsic growth rates ranged from zero to 0.69 d(-1), these low growth rates being atypical of oligotrophic lakes. Bacterial growth rate was stimulated on different occasions by addition of an organic carbon substrate or by addition of mineral nutrients; however, during summer stratification bacterial growth was principally limited by phosphorus availability. Bacterial growth rate fluctuated irregularly, apparently influenced by the influx of resources from the catchment and hence by rainfall patterns. Bacterial growth rarely responded to increased incubation temperature. Although bacterial growth in Loch Ness was generally slow, new bacterial production was removed quite efficiently by grazers and bacterial densities showed only little fluctuation.

The IPCC has projected that higher temperatures may outscore the known optimal and maximum temperatures for maize. The purpose of this study was to improve the ability of the maize model CSM-IXIM to simulate crop development, growth, and yield under hot conditions, especially with regards to the impact of above-optimal temperatures around anthesis. Field and greenhouse experiments that were performed over three years (2014-2016) using the same short-season hybrid, PR37N01 (FAO 300), provided the data for this work. Maize was sown at a target population density of 5 plants M-2 on two sowing dates in 2014 and 2015 and on one in 2016 at three locations in Spain (northern, central, and southern Spain) with a well-defined thermal gradient. The same hybrid was also sown in two greenhouse chambers with daytime target temperatures of approximately 25 and above 35 degrees C. During the nighttime, the temperature in both chambers was allowed to equilibrate with the outside temperature. The greenhouse treatments consisted of moving 18 plants at selected phenological stages (V4, V9, anthesis, lag phase, early grain filling) from the cool chamber to the hot chamber over a week and then returning the plants back to the cool chamber. An additional control treatment remained in the cool chamber all season, and in 2015 and 2016, one treatment remained permanently in the hot chamber. Two maize models in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) V4.6 were compared, namely CERES and IXIM. The HUM version included additional components that were previously developed to improve the crop N simulation and to incorporate the anthesis-silking interval (ASI). A new thermal time calculation, a heat stress index, the impact of pollen-sterilizing temperatures, and the explicit simulation of male and female flowering as affected by the daily heat conditions were added to IXIM. The phenology simulation in field experiments by IXIM improved substantially. The RMSE for silking and maturity in CERES were 7.9 and 13.7 days, decreasing in DCIM to 2.8 and 7.3 days, respectively. Similarly, the estimated kernel numbers, kernel weight, grain yield and final biomass were always closer to the measurements in HUM than in CERES. The worst simulations were for kernel weight, and for that reason, the differences in grain yield between the models were small (the RMSE in CERES was 1219 kg ha(-1) vs. 1082 kg ha(-1) in IXIM). The greenhouse results also supported the improved estimations of crop development by IXIM (RMSE of 2.6 days) relative to CERES (7.4 days). The impact of the heat treatments on grain yield was consistently overestimated by CERES, while HUM captured the general trend. The new HUM model improved the CERES simulations when elevated temperatures were included in the evaluation data. Additional model testing with measurements from a wider latitudinal range and relevant heat conditions are required.",,,,,"Lizaso, Jon I/K-6451-2017; Ramos, Margarita Ruiz/H-9933-2015; Oliveira-Prendes, Jose Alberto A/E-3732-2016; Rodríguez, Alfredo/E-9190-2017; Torres, Ignacio J.

The electric-energy consumed by heat pumps, applied mainly for cooling, accounts for 15-35% of the total electric-energy used in a PPAL. To reduce the electric-energy consumption, an air exchanger with low capacity (180 W) was used for cooling by introducing outdoor cold air. In this experiment, the indoor air temperature in two PPALs (floor area: 6.2 m(2) each) was maintained at 25 and 20 degrees C during photoperiod and dark period, respectively, for lettuce production. A null CO2 balance enrichment method was used in both PPALs. In one PPAL (PPAL(e)), an air exchanger (air flow rate: 250 m(3).h(-1)) was used along with a heat pump (cooling capacity: 3.2 kW) to maintain the indoor air temperature at the set-point. The other PPAL (PPAL(c)) with only a heat pump (cooling capacity: 3.2 kW) was used for reference. Effects of introducing outdoor cold air on energy use efficiency, coefficient of performance (COP), electric-energy consumption for cooling and growth of lettuce were investigated. The results show that: when the air temperature difference between indoor and outdoor ranged from 20.2 to 30.0 degrees C: (1) the average energy use efficiency of the air exchanger was 2.8 and 3.4 times greater than the COP of the heat pumps in the PPAL(e) and PPAL(c), respectively; (2) hourly electric-energy consumption for cooling in the PPAL(e) reduced by 15.8-73.7% compared with that in the PPAL(c); (3) daily supply of CO2 in the PPAL(e) reduced from 0.15 to 0.04 kg compared with that in the PPAL, with the outdoor air temperature ranging from -5.6 to 2.7 degrees C; (4) no significant difference in lettuce growth was observed in both PPALs.

We explored the chemical and thermal marking of otoliths for the species in this study, hoping to provide appropriate marking approaches for it. Chemical marking was conducted by immersing elongate loach in alizarin complexone (ALC) of concentrations 50-250 mg L-1 or alizarin red S (ARS) of concentrations 30-150 mg L-1. The results demonstrated that all concentrations of ALC and ARS treatments had 100 % fluorescent marks in sagittae and lapilli (grade aeyen 3), and that mark quality and mortality increased with increasing of fluorochrome concentration, while decreased with increasing of total length. The optimal conditions of otolith fluorescent marking for larval and juvenile elongate loach were to immerse in 50-100 mg L-1 ALC or 30-90 mg L-1 ARS solutions for 12-24 h. Larvae thermally marked by being exposed to five water temperature regimes represented different patterns of otolith increment. The control of duration in the heated water could produce some narrow or wide increments, and there was a significantly positive relationship between increment width and duration in heated water in each cycle of water temperature fluctuation. More and complicated otolith mark patterns could be produced by combining thermal marking with fluorescent immersion.

NSC variation in moist tropical forests has rarely been studied, so regulation of NSCs in these systems is poorly understood. We measured foliar and branch NSC content in 23 tree species at three sites located across a large precipitation gradient in Panama during the 2015-2016 El Nino to examine how short- and long-term climatic variation impact carbohydrate dynamics. There was no significant difference in total NSCs as the drought progressed (leaf P = 0.32, branch P = 0.30) nor across the rainfall gradient (leaf P = 0.91, branch P = 0.96). Foliar soluble sugars decreased while starch increased over the duration of the dry period, suggesting greater partitioning of NSCs to storage than metabolism or transport as drought progressed. There was a large variation across species at all sites, but total foliar NSCs were positively correlated with leaf mass per area, whereas branch sugars were positively related to leaf temperature and negatively correlated with daily photosynthesis and wood density.

The overall decline in E. coli O157:H7 was primarily determined by competition with autochthonous copiotrophic bacteria simulated by an inter-specific competition term according to Lotka-Volterra. Oscillations of bacterial populations were attained by the relationships between relative growth and death rates with readily available substrate content. The model contains a logistic and exponential relation of relative growth and death rates, respectively, of E. coli O157:H7 and copiotrophic bacteria with temperature, resulting in optimum curves for net growth rates similar to the curves reported in the literature. The model has been both calibrated and validated on experimental data. The model was used to perform sensitivity analysis and to evaluate different manure and soil management scenarios in terms of survival of E. coli O157:H7. The relative effects of changes in temperature on simulated survival time of E. coli O157:H7 were more pronounced than changes in oxygen condition. Testing manure storage scenarios with realistic data revealed that manure stored in a heap that was turned every week resulted in almost 70% reduction of E. coli O157:H7 survival compared to unturned manure. At the surface of a heap with unturned manure, simulated survival time was the longest (2.4 times longer than inside the same heap). The simulation model provides a new approach to investigating dynamic changes of invasive microorganisms in natural substrates such as manure or manure-amended soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

LBFs inhabit a broad range of shallow-water settings. Within species, differences in thermal tolerance have been found among populations from different habitats, but it is not clear whether such differences occur among LBFs inhabiting similar habitats, but differing in other aspects, such as symbiont type. To this end, we compared responses to thermal stress in specimens from a population of Amphistegina lessonii, an abundant Indo-Pacific species, to specimens of Amphistegina gibbosa, its Atlantic counter-part, from a similar environment but two different water depths (5 and 18 m). Test groups of each species were exposed in a common experiment to three thermal stress scenarios over a four-week period. Growth, respiration, mortality and motility were measured to characterize the holobiont response. Coloration, photosynthesis and chlorophyll a content were measured to determine the response of the endosymbiotic diatoms. The photosymbionts were characterized by genetic fingerprinting. Our results show that, although groups of A. gibbosa were collected from different habitats, their responses were similar, indicating only marginally higher tolerance to thermal peaks in specimens from the shallower site. In contrast, species-specific differences were stronger, with A. lessonii showing higher tolerance to episodic stress and less pronounced impacts of chronic stress on motility, growth and photosymbiont performance. These interspecies variations are consistent with the presence of different and more diverse symbiont assemblages in A. lessonii compared with A. gibbosa.

In our study, we attempted to gain a better insight on the effects of repeated heat stresses over two plant generations (i.e. Mother and Progeny plants) on yield components, seed nutritional and physiological quality criteria, under two contrasting sulphur supplies. Results measured in seeds that were at the onset of maturation when the temperature stress was applied indicated that (i) Progeny effects were predominant over Mother effects on most measured variables, thus indicating no intergenerational effects, (ii) the extent of the Progeny effects was modulated by the Mother effects e.g. amplified or attenuated differences on the desiccation tolerance proxy, according to the Mother plant origin, and (iii) the longer the cumulated duration of the temperature stress over the two plant cycles, the more negatively impacted the quality criteria with decreased fatty acids concentration, increased 0)6:0)3 ratio, lower desiccation tolerance and increased seed dormancy.

The soil was incubated at 10 degreesC and 12 degreesC, with or without leaf litter and with or without plants present. The purpose of the experiment was to analyse decomposition and nutrient transformations under simulated, realistic conditions in a future warmer Arctic. Both temperature enhancement and litter addition increased respiration rates. Temperature enhancement and surprisingly also litter addition decreased microbial biomass carbon (C) content, resulting in a pronounced increase of specific respiration. Microbial P content increased progressively with temperature enhancement and litter addition, concomitant with increasing P mineralisation, whereas microbial N increased only in the litter treatment, at the same time as net N mineralisation decreased. In contrast, microbial biomass N decreased as temperature increased, resulting in a high mobilisation of inorganic N. Plant responses were closely coupled to the balance of microbial mineralisation and immobilisation. Plant growth and N accumulation was low after litter addition because of high N immobilisation in microbes and low net mineralisation, resulting in plant N limitation. Growth increased in the temperature-enhanced treatments, but was eventually limited by low supply of P, reflected in a low plant P concentration and high N-to-P ratio. Hence, the different microbial responses caused plant N limitation after litter addition and P limitation after temperature enhancement. Although microbial processes determined the main responses in plants, the plants themselves influenced nutrient turnover. With plants present, P mobilisation to the plant plus soil inorganic pools increased significantly, and N mobilisation non- significantly, when litter was added. This was presumably due to increased mineralisation in the rhizosphere, or because the nutrients in addition to being immobilised by microbes also could be absorbed by plants. This suggests that the common method of measuring nutrient mineralisation in soils incubated without plants may underestimate the rates of nutrient mobilisation, which probably contributes to a commonly observed discrepancy of measured lower rates of net nutrient mineralisation than uptake rates in arctic soils.

Data from 292 groups of rainbow trout fed a large variety of different diets for which digestible energy intake can be assumed as the factor limiting growth were used in the analysis. Intake of digestible energy, energy retention and protein as well as lipid gain had been quantified for each group of trout. Multiple regression suggested that maintenance requirement for digestible energy was dependent on the 0.43 power of body weight in grams. Depending on growth rate, maintenance requirement contributed to between 10 and 30% of the total digestible energy requirement. The utilisation of digestible energy that was available for retention proved to be dependent on fat concentration in the diet. Effects of dietary crude protein concentration or water temperature on digestible energy utilisation could not be determined for this data set. Daily digestible energy requirement (kJ) could be best predicted by 1.31 BW0.43 (g) + retained energy (kJ/day)/[0.66 (1 + 0.000652 g fat/kg dry diet)]. Assuming a partial efficiency of DE utilisation above maintenance for fat retention of 0.9, a partial efficiency of DE above maintenance for protein retention of 0.54 was calculated. An inter-laboratory approach is suggested to obtain a wider range of experimental data and, therefore, to improve the suitability of models for general application. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

To assess the influence of tidal variability on phytoplankton rates, we performed eight, same-day dilution experiments at high and low tide (6-h intervals) in the Skidaway River Estuary, Georgia, measuring phytoplankton growth, microzooplankton grazing, and virus-induced mortality. Chlorophyll and group-specific biomass (Synechococcus spp., picoeukaryotes, and nanoeukaryotes) varied between tides and multidimensional scaling clustering of tidal biomass revealed separation in community composition based on tide. Rates also varied significantly over the tidal cycle, especially microzooplankton grazing, which was higher at low tide in most experiments with rates ranging from 0-3.77 d(-1) at low tide to 0-1.51 d(-1) at high tide. Virus-induced mortality rates were rarely detected, only being observed in Synechococcus spp. in three experiments (0.3-0.8 d(-1)) and picoeukaryotes twice (similar to 0.36 d(-1)). The differences in grazing and growth rates observed between the two tides were not explained by temperature, salinity, or sunlight (i.e., time of day) and grazing was only weakly explained by initial chlorophyll concentration (R-2 = 0.36), highlighting the influence of community composition on rate measurements. These results suggest that within tidally influenced areas, short-term sampling over the tidal cycle is essential to accurately characterize daily phytoplankton dynamics and reliably monitor and predict shifts in primary production and coastal ecosystem health.",,,,,,"Harvey, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3518-0035; Anderson, Sean/0000-0003-3096-1120",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,NOV,2018,63,6,,,,,2411,2422,,10.1002/lno.10948,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10948,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000450233300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aims at testing the survival of Drosophila melanogaster under constant low temperatures (CLTs) (2, 3, 4, and 5 degrees C) vs. fluctuating thermal regimes (FTRs). In the latter, the cold stress period was interrupted daily by 2 h pulses at 20 degrees C. Since acclimation enhances cold tolerance, we tested whether benefits of acclimation can combine with those of FTRs. Since D. melanogaster overwinters as non-reproductive adults, we tested if actively reproducing adults are more susceptible to cold stress than virgin females that have a much reduced reproductive activity. The results show that short interruptions of cold stress enhanced survival of adult flies. Survival was time- and temperature-dependent. Prior acclimation to low temperature allowed flies to better cope with cold stress under CLTs. On the other hand, acclimated flies did not profit from the benefits of FTRs and even showed lower survival under FTRs, probably because flies deacclimated during the periodic warm intervals. Gravid females were overall less cold tolerant than virgin females, and both survived better under FTRs. Cold survival at pupal stage was much lower than at adult stage, and no clear benefit of FIR was observed in this life stage.

This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favor individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Additionally, understanding whether and how selection acts on thermal physiological plasticity is also highly relevant to climate change and biological conservation. Here, we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul. We measured plastic responses of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioral thermal preference, and thermal sensitivity of metabolism to acclimation at 10 and 20 degrees C. We monitored survival during three separate recapture efforts and used mark-recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the relationship between survivals as a function of the plasticity of thermal traits. Overall, we found no evidence that thermal acclimation in this population is being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival increased in individuals with higher tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated, probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year. Furthermore, survival increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were nonsignificant, and the constraints of our experimental design prevented us from evaluating more complex models (i.e., nonlinear selection).",,,,,"Gaitan-Espitia, Juan Diego/A-9945-2012; Ruiz-Aravena, Manuel/G-8093-2015","Gaitan-Espitia, Juan Diego/0000-0001-8781-5736; Ruiz-Aravena, Manuel/0000-0001-8463-7858",,,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,DEC,2018,11,10,,,,,2004,2013,,10.1111/eva.12702,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.12702,,,,,,,,30459844,,,,,WOS:000449942900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a first experiment, GEM-Surf, the near surface and land surface modeling system, is driven by operational atmospheric forecasts and used to refine the surface forecasts according to local surface conditions such as elevation and vegetation type. In this simple form, temperature and snow depth forecasts are improved mainly as a result of the better representation of real elevation. In a second experiment, screen level observations and operational atmospheric forecasts are blended to drive a continuous cycle of near surface and land surface hindcasts. Hindcasts of the previous day conditions are then regarded as today's optimized initial conditions. Hence, in this experiment, given observations are available, observation driven hindcasts continuously ensure that daily forecasts are issued from improved initial conditions. GEM-Surf forecasts obtained from improved short-range hindcasts produced using these better conditions result in improved snow depth forecasts. In a third experiment, assimilation of snow depth data is applied to further optimize GEM-Surf's initial conditions, in addition to the use of blended observations and forecasts for forcing.

A group of 70 adults were caught in the wild and the 38 males and 32 females distributed at random in six tanks. All the fish were acclimated to the same semi-moist diet (M) in the pre-experimental period from December to February. Three dietary treatments were offered in the experimental period from March to May with two replicates (tanks) per treatment. The treatments were M alone, M supplemented with fresh mussels (Mytilus edulis) (M + M), and M supplemented with live polychaetes (Perinereis cultrifera) (M + P). Spawning occurred during April and May when water temperature was 17 and 18 degrees C, respectively, and salinity around 34-35 ppt. Average daily dry matter intake expressed as a proportion of body weight was M 0.65 +/- 0.34%, M + M 0.43 +/- 0.18%, and M + P 0.56 +/- 0.27%, and differed significantly (P < 0.05) between treatments. The average daily dry matter intake within a tank ranged from 0.31 +/- 0.04% in February to 0.98 +/- 0.26% in May (P < 0.05), apparently due to changes in the photo-thermal regime. Diet significantly affected the number of days when spawning occurred, the number of days when hatched eggs were produced, and the proportion of fertilized eggs (P < 0.05); and affected the number of days on which viable eggs were produced during April (NS). In all cases, the results were lowest for M + M, while those for the other two treatments did not differ significantly. Differences in hatching rate were not significant in April. During May, no spawning occurred in fish given the M + M treatment, and the differences between the other two treatments were not significant. Values for all variates tended to be higher for M + P than M + M in April and lower for M + P and M in May. These results suggest that supplementing the semi-moist diet with mussels depressed feed intake and, consequently, reproductive performance: the semi-moist diet alone and semi-moist diet supplemented with polychaetes allowed satisfactory food intake and reproductive performance in broodstock sole.

The mesocosms were fertilized with similar to 0.8 mu M dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) to stimulate diazotrophy. Bulk N-2 fixation rates were replicable between the three mesocosms, averaged 18.5 +/- 1.1 nmol N L-1 d(-1) over the 23 days, and increased by a factor of 2 during the second half of the experiment (days 15 to 23) to reach 27.3 +/- 1.0 nmol N L-1 d(-1). These later rates measured after the DIP fertilization are higher than the upper range reported for the global ocean. During the 23 days of the experiment, N-2 fixation rates were positively correlated with seawater temperature, primary production, bacterial production, standing stocks of particulate organic carbon (POC), nitrogen (PON) and phosphorus (POP), and alkaline phosphatase activity, and negatively correlated with DIP concen-trations, DIP turnover time, nitrate, and dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. The fate of DDN was investigated during a bloom of the unicellular diazotroph UCYN-C that occurred during the second half of the experiment. Quantification of diazotrophs in the sediment traps indicates that similar to 10 % of UCYN-C from the water column was exported daily to the traps, representing as much as 22.4 +/- 5.5 % of the total POC exported at the height of the UCYN-C bloom. This export was mainly due to the aggregation of small (5.7 +/- 0.8 mu m) UCYN-C cells into large (100-500 mu m) aggregates. During the same time period, a DDN transfer experiment based on high-resolution nanometerscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) coupled with N-15(2) isotopic labeling revealed that 16 +/- 6 % of the DDN was released to the dissolved pool and 21 +/- 4 % was transferred to non-diazotrophic plankton, mainly picoplankton (18 +/- 4 %) followed by diatoms (3 +/- 2 %). This is consistent with the observed dramatic increase in picoplankton and diatom abundances, primary production, bacterial production, and standing stocks of POC, PON, and POP in the mesocosms during the second half of the experiment.

However, there are speculations that domestic animals lost the ability to reduce energy expenditure during food shortage and adverse environmental conditions. Therefore, we investigated physiological and behavioural strategies employed by a robust domesticated horse breed, the Shetland pony, over the course of a year under temperate conditions by measuring ambient temperature (T-a), subcutaneous temperature (T-s), locomotor activity (LA), lying time, resting heart rate, body mass and body condition score. Ten animals were kept on pasture in summer and in open stables in winter; further, in winter the animals were allocated into one control and one feed-restricted group of five animals each to simulate natural seasonal food shortage. The annual course of the mean daily T-s of all horses showed distinct fluctuations from a mean of 35.6 +/- 0.5 degrees C, with higher variations in summer than in winter. Diurnal amplitudes in T-s were highest (P<0.001) in April (12.6 degrees C) and lowest in January (4.0 degrees C), with a nadir around dawn and a peak around mid-day. The feed-restricted group had a significantly lower daily T-s compared with the control group on cold winter days, with T-a values below 0 degrees C. Mean annual heart rate and LA followed T-a closely. Heart rate of the feed-restricted animals significantly decreased from a mean of 52.8 +/- 8.1. beats. min(-1) in summer to 29 +/- 3.9. beats. min(-1) in winter and differed from the control group (P<0.001). Mean daily LA was lowest at the end of winter (7000. activity impulses day(-1)) and highest in summer (25,000. activity. impulses. day(-1)).

Litter was the most important factor in determining spatial variability in seedling recruitment, whereas differences in climatic conditions among years, especially temperature fluctuations in late winter and early spring, determined the temporal variability in seedling recruitment. Compared with control plots, significantly more new individuals of bryophytes and seedlings as well as a number of new species of vascular plants were noted in the litter-removal plots over the 16-year study. Litter strongly impeded seedling emergence of small-seeded species. The negative effect of litter on seedling recruitment of large-seeded species and the recruitment of new shoots in species growing clonally was much weaker. There was a significant positive correlation between the numbers of seedlings in the litter-removal and control plots and temperatures in January to March. In the litter-removal plots this mainly affected small-seeded species. Seedling recruitment was less consistently related to variation in precipitation.

We estimate soil evaporation (E) using the complementary concept and soil surface temperature, therefore, the revised G(c)-TSEB requires no soil moisture as input. We tested G(c)-TSEB at 10 flux sites under various land cover and climate conditions. The flux-calibrated G(c)-TSEB performed well in ET predictions, with determinant coefficients (R-2) larger than 0.9 at most of the sites. The modeled transpiration was highly correlated with the Gross Primary Production, indicating the usefulness of the model in ET partitioning. More importantly, G(c)-TSEB can be calibrated against the land surface temperature (LST), which is operationally available using remote sensing technique. Overall, daily ET that was predicted by the LST-calibrated G(c)-TSEB generally matched the trends of the ET measurements at most of the sites, and R-2 range from 0.63 to 0.93, with a median of 0.80, at all sites. Transpiration estimation was highly consistent with the simulations from the flux-calibrated model. Moreover, in vegetated surfaces, soil evaporation was estimated reasonably well using the LST-calibrated G(c)-TSEB. However, positive biases are prevalent when vegetated fraction is smaller than 0.2, especially in cold regions because of the dramatic differences in evaporation process between summer and winter. To improve model performances, calibrating G(c)-TSEB model in separated periods and using prior knowledge as constraints proved to be useful.",,,,,,"Bu, Jingyi/0000-0001-6791-4235; Gao, Yanchun/0000-0002-6308-3101; Gan, Guojing/0000-0002-4683-5121; Kang, Tingting/0000-0001-9059-2094",,,,,,,,,,,,,0034-4257,1879-0704,,,,MAR 15,2019,223,,,,,,243,256,,10.1016/j.rse.2019.01.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.01.020,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000459949200018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The methods comprise improved control of existing indoor temperature and ventilation airflow control systems, without humidification and dehumidification devices. Simulations were performed with EnergyPlus software; the multi-zone model of the building was calibrated and verified with existing measured data. A warm period of the year was simulated, and six weeks of it were experimentally validated. The existing heating and cooling systems comprised radiators and in some areas, fan-coils.

In deep waters (below the thermocline), decomposition was slow (tau between 770 and 1,733 h) and was controlled by bacterial processes. Water temperature was a promising predictor of decomposition half-lives in freshwater. Using a novel underwater infrared camera system, we identified the daily and seasonal patterns of scavenging activity by littoral fish. Only three species displayed scavenging behavior, with creek chubs being the most active. Fast fish-mediated littoral recycling of fish carcass may explain the lack of direct observations of carcasses in lakes.

This paper discusses the results of experiments aimed at analyzing exploitation competition between the invading species and other ant species in a park community. The Argentine ant was found to implement several strategies favoring its success in exploitation competition: mass recruitment, use of various microhabitats (on the ground and in trees), and activity over a wide range of temperatures. Although these strategies were not exclusive to L. humile, their joint use, together with the large number of workers forming each unicolony, conferred a clear advantage for resource exploitation. Some native species were more severely affected than others by the presence of L. humile in terms of both abundance and behavior. The worst affected species were those whose ecological cbaracteristics were similar to those of the Argentine ant, e.g., Pheidole pallidula (Nylander, 1849); the species least affected was Cataglyphis floricola Tinaut, 1993, possibly because of its subordinate and thermophilous nature (little overlap of daily activity rhythms with the exotic species).",,,,,"Reyes-Lopez, Joaquin/AAW-6300-2021; Cerda, Xim/P-6461-2014; JOAQUIN, REYES-LOPEZ/P-5062-2014; Retana, Javier/L-1214-2014","Cerda, Xim/0000-0002-3222-2471; Retana, Javier/0000-0002-7505-9467",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,OCT,2007,36,5,,,,,1100,1111,,10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36[1100:ESOTIA]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36[1100:ESOTIA]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,18284734,,,,,WOS:000250128900016,View Full Record in Web of Science

CH4 emissions were measured seasonally from nine locations on two mangrove creeks on Naples Bay in southwest Florida, USA. One of the tidal creeks has been impacted in the past few decades with alteration of upstream watersheds and freshwater inflows; the other creek was an un-impacted reference tidal creek. Our study sites were established along a longitudinal gradient (distance to the cree.s mouth) with different plant communities and freshwater influences, which were further evaluated by measurements during the dry and wet seasons. CH4 emission measurements were also performed during the flood and ebb tides (n = 6) to incorporate the influence of water level fluctuations on CH4 emissions. Additionally, hydroperiods and soil pore water electrical conductivity (EC) as a measure of salinity were measured along the study creeks. Our study showed very small, if not negligible, CH4 emissions from mangrove soils in this southwest Florida location at all sampling locations and sampling times. Despite our collecting over 1900 methane samples from methane emission chambers, most analyses of rates of change in the chambers showed no methane emissions. Seasonal averages ranged from 0.24 to 1.68 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1) (annual average of 0.32 g CH4-C m(-2) y(-1)). Ironically, the lowest methane emissions were at the end (December-January) of a typical wet season of daily rainfall and were highest in the dry season (March-April) when freshwater inputs from watersheds and precipitation were negligible. Water level fluctuations, freshwater inputs, and plant species composition did not play a significant role in CH4 emissions. There appeared to be a slight pattern of methane emissions versus air temperature but the relationship was not linear. Combining our results with carbon sequestration rates in a companion study suggested that mangroves in southwest Florida are clearly net sinks of both carbon and radiative forcing and therefore beneficial for mitigating climate warming.",,,,,,"MacDonnell, Conor/0000-0002-7154-1117; Lasso, Ana/0000-0001-9975-0386; Bydalek, Franciszek/0000-0003-1603-5665",,,,,,,,,,,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,APR 15,2018,114,,,,SI,,57,65,,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.041,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000428961600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Plants were kept outdoors in mild winter conditions (average daily temperature range: -1 to 12 degrees C) before being transferred to a glasshouse (temperature range: 20-30 degrees C) and allowed to acclimate for different periods before experiments. 'Glasshouse plants' were acclimated for at least 9 d, and 'outdoor plants' were acclimated for fewer than 3 d before laboratory gas exchange experiments. The transient stomatal opening response to leaf excision was roughly twice as long in outdoor plants as in glasshouse plants. To elucidate the reason for this difference, we inferred variables of stomatal water relations (epidermal and guard cell turgor pressures and guard cell osmotic pressure: P-e, P-g and pi(g), respectively) from stomatal conductance (g(s)) and bulk leaf water potential (Psi(1)), using a hydromechanical model of g(s). Psi(1) was calculated from cumulative post-excision transpirational water loss using empirical relationships between Psi(1) and relative water content obtained on similar leaves. Inferred P-g and P-e both declined immediately after leaf excision. Inferred pi(g) also declined after a lag period. The kinetics of pi(g) adjustment after the lag were similar in outdoors and glasshouse plants, bait the lag period was much longer in outdoor plants. This suggests that the longer transient opening response in outdoor plants resulted from slower induction, not slower execution, of guard cell osmoregulation.

Four isocaloric fish meal based diets ranging from 30% to 45% in protein were fed to triplicate groups of Blue streak hap for 8 weeks. Fish (initial weight, 0.85 g) were reared in twelve 50 L aquarium with biological filter and controlled temperature (27.5 degrees C), in stocking density of ten fish/aquarium. Results showed that dietary protein level significantly influenced final weight, weight gain and specific growth rate of fish. Maximum growth of fish was observed in the 40% protein diet, although this was not significantly different from the 35% and 45% protein diets (P > 0.05). Specific growth rate and feed efficiency increased from 30% to 40% protein, and thereafter decreased for diet 45% protein. There were statistically significantly differences in feed intake among treatments (P < 0.05). Fish fed with the highest protein diet had lower percentage daily feed consumption values than those of fish fed with the lowest protein diet. Under the experimental conditions applied, juvenile blue streak hap, L.

How. ever, under selection pressure, this weed shows population differentiation for adaptive traits. Intraspecific variation for herbicide resistance has been studied, but no studies have been conducted to determine the existence of variation for other adaptive traits that could influence weed management. The objective of this study was to examine the existence of different seed dormancy regulatory mechanisms in common waterhemp. Seed dormancy regulation, in response to different temperature and moisture regimes, was studied through germination experiments and proteome analysis using two common waterhemp biotypes (Ames and Everly) collected from agricultural fields in Iowa, and one biotype (Ohio) collected from a pristine area in Ohio. Without stratification, germination percentage among the different biorypes was 9, 29 and 88% for Ames, Everly, and Ohio respectively. The germination rate of seeds.. from Ames was dramatically increased after incubation at either 4 or 25 C under wet conditions, whereas germination of seeds from Everly was only increased at 25, C under wet conditions. The Ohio biotype showed no change in germination response to any of the incubation treatments. Germination studies indicated that the rate of seed dormancy alleviation differed between biorypes. Seed protein profiles obtained from the three biorypes differed in protein abundance, number, and type. A putative small heat-shock protein (sHSP) of 17.6 kDa and isoelectric point (pI) 6.1 increased whereas a putative glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) of 30.9 kDa and pI 6.4 decreased in abundance in the Ames biotype as seed dormancy was reduced in response to incubation at 4 C and wet conditions. These two proteins did not change in the Everly and Ohio biotypes, suggesting that these proteins changed their abundance in response to seed dormancy alleviation. The results of this study suggest that differences in seed dormancy levels between the biorypes were due to different physiological regulatory mechanisms.",,,,,,"Leon, Ramon/0000-0002-1924-3331",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1745,1550-2759,,,,MAR-APR,2006,54,2,,,,,305,315,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000236728600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesized that swimming times during the hottest periods of the day would show different performances. To test this hypothesis a total of 180 Muscovy ducklings were randomly distributed into 4 equal groups in a completely randomized design experiment. All groups were raised under similar housing conditions. Birds of the first group (C) were raised in the indoor system and had no access to a swimming pond. While all birds of the second, third, and fourth groups (T1, T2, and T3) had access to a swimming pond during 10:00 to 12:00 h, 12:00 to 14:00 h, and 14:00 to 16:00 h, respectively. The swimming pond (dimensions of 30 m length x 10 m width x 3 m depth with cement floor) was located in the front of the house. Vaccination and medical programs were undertaken according to the different ages under supervision of a licensed veterinarian. The obtained results indicated that swimming during 12:00 to 14:00 h improved (P < 0.05) growth performance, dressed carcass, meat tenderness, lymphocyte, heterophils/lymphocytes ratio, body temperature, and mortality rate of Muscovy ducks. However, bone measurement, plumage conditions, foot pad dermatitis, hock discoloration, breast blisters score, and blood hematocrit values were insignificantly better in the group with access to the swimming pond during 12:00 to 14:00 h. In conclusion, raising ducks during hot conditions in an open-sided house with access to a swimming pond at 12:00 to 14:00 h is highly recommended due to the high BW, better immunity, decreased mortality rate, and low body temperature of ducks which was positively reflected in the health condition.",,,,,"Rehman, Zaib Ur/AAH-2701-2020; Mahrose, Khalid/F-9212-2011","Rehman, Zaib Ur/0000-0002-8109-797X; Mahrose, Khalid/0000-0002-9917-5921",,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-5791,1525-3171,,,,NOV,2017,96,11,,,,,3912,3919,,10.3382/ps/pex207,http://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pex207,,,,,,,,29050417,,,,,WOS:000416733000015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this study is to review what has been documented, thus it gives an overview of what is known and seeks to explain the implications of a changing climate, hence what ought to be known to create a climate resilient environment. Design/methodology/approach Terms such as climate, climate change and climate variability were identified in recent peer-reviewed published literature to find recent climate-related literature on Uganda. Findings from independent researchers and consultants are incorporated. Data obtained from rainfall and temperature observations and from COSMO-CLM Regional Climate Model-Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CCLM CORDEX) data, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) have been used to generate spatial maps, seasonal outputs and projections using GrADS 2.02 and Geographic Information System (GIS) software for visualization. Findings The climate of Uganda is tropical in nature and influenced by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), varied relief, geo-location and inland lakes, among other factors. The impacts of severe weather and climate trends and variability have been documented substantially in the past 20-30 years. Most studies indicated a rainfall decline. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures are on the rise, while projections indicate a decrease in rainfall and increase in temperature both in the near and far future. The implication of these changes on society and the economy are discussed herein. Cost of inaction is expected to become huge, given factors like, the growing rate of the population and the slow expanding economy experienced in Uganda. Varied forms of adaptation to the impacts of climate change are being implemented, especially in the agricultural sector and at house hold level, though not systematically.

Prior to ice formation, water temperatures can fluctuate from nighttime lows near 0 degrees C to daytime highs near 6 degrees C. After ice formation, temperatures remain constant near 0 degrees C. Climate change is projected to reduce the duration of surface ice cover in aquatic ecosystems and, thus, alter winter temperature regimes. We conducted a laboratory experiment to compare fish energy use for two situations: (1) ice free conditions with diel cycling temperatures (0.2-6 degrees C), and (2) ice cover conditions with constant low temperatures (0.5 degrees C). We compared the response of Creek Chub Semotilus atromaculatus, representing a coolwater species, and Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, representing a coldwater species, to these temperature regimes. During a 60-d study we monitored metabolic measurements of energy use and proximate body composition of fasted fish. For Creek Chub, there was no effect of time or temperature regime on respiration rates. Ammonium excretion declined over time for Creek Chub held at the constant low temperature but remained unchanged for fish held at the cycling temperature. For Brook Trout, there was no effect of time or temperature regime on respiration or ammonium excretion. Both species showed a loss of body lipids over the 60 d but there was no difference in the rate of loss between the two temperature treatments. Thus, we were unable to detect a difference in the energy use for these species between the different thermal regimes simulating the presence or absence of surface ice cover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,2015,144,5,,,,,990,997,,10.1080/00028487.2015.1057347,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2015.1057347,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000362668900011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Even though a hot water-based heating system is evidently superior to a hot air-based heating system, in terms of the thermally stable condition or energy saving, a hot air-based heating system has occupied the domestic market due to its economic efficiency from an initial investment cost saving. However, the intrinsic drawbacks of a hot air-based heating system, being more frequent variation of thermal variables and an inordinate disturbance on crops due to its convective heat delivery nature, are believed to be the main reasons for the insufficient crop yield and/or the quality deterioration. In addition, the current thermal environment monitoring system in a greenhouse, in which a sole sensor node usually covers a large part of cultivating area, seems to have a profound need of improvement in order to resolve those problems, in that the assumption of thermal uniform condition, which is adequate for a sole sensor node system, cannot be ensured in some cases. In this study, the qualitative concept of the new control variablethe degree of uniformityis suggested as an indicator to seek ways of enhancing the crop yield and its quality based on the multiple sensor nodes system with a wireless sensor network. In contrast to a conventional monitoring system, for which a newly suggested concept of qualitative variable cannot be estimated at all, the multiple sensor nodes-based thermal monitoring system can provide more accurate and precise sensing, which enables the degree of uniformity to be checked in real-time and thus more precise control becomes possible as a consequence. From the analysis of the results of the experiment and simulation, it is found that the crops in plastic vinyl houses can be exposed to a serious level of non-uniform thermal condition. For instance, the temperature difference in the longitudinal and widthwise direction is 3.0 degrees C and 6.5 degrees C, respectively for the case of 75 x 8 m dimension greenhouse during a typical winter season, and it can be hypothesized that this level of non-uniformity might cause considerable damage to crop growth. In this paper, several variants of control systems, within the framework of the multiple sensor nodes system, is proposed to provide a more thermally-stable cultivating environment and the experimental verification is carried out for different scales of test greenhouses. The results showed that a simple change of heating mode (i.e., from a hot air- to a hot water-based heating system) can bring about a significant improvement for the non-uniformity of temperature (more or less 80%), and an additional countermeasure, with local heat flux control, can lead to a supplementary cut of non-uniformity up to 90%. Among the several variants of local heat flux control systems, the hydraulic proportional mass flow control valve system was proven to represent the best performance, and it can be hypothesized that the newly suggested qualitative variablethe degree of uniformitywith the multiple sensor nodes system can be a good alternative for seeking enhanced cultivating performance, being higher crop yield and better quality along with energy cost saving.",,,,,"Shin, Ki-Yeol/AAY-6943-2020","Shin, Ki-Yeol/0000-0002-5427-4459",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,MAY 1,2019,12,9,,,,,,,1749,10.3390/en12091749,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12091749,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000469761700165,View Full Record in Web of Science

The timing, magnitude and intensity of these events are very sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, particularly across the boreal region where snowpacks are declining and summer droughts are increasing. It is important to understand how landscape characteristics modulate event-scale DOC dynamics in order to scale up predictions from sites across regions, and to understand how climatic changes will influence DOC dynamics across the boreal forest. The goal of this study was to assess variability in DOC concentrations in boreal headwater streams across catchments with varying physiographic characteristics (e.g., size, proportion of wetland) during a range of hydrological events (e.g., spring snowmelt, summer/fall storm events). From 2016 to 2017, continuous discharge and sub-daily chemistry grab samples were collected from three adjacent study catchments located at the International Institute for Sustainable Development-Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada. Catchment differences were more apparent in summer and fall events and less apparent during early spring melt events. Hysteresis analysis suggested that DOC sources were proximal to the stream for all events at a catchment dominated by a large wetland near the outlet, but distal from the stream at the catchments that lacked significant wetland coverage during the summer and fall. Wetland coverage also influenced responses of DOC export to antecedent moisture; at the wetland-dominated catchment, there were consistent negative relationships between DOC concentrations and antecedent moisture, while at the catchments without large wetlands, the relationships were positive or not significant. These results emphasize the utility of sub-daily sampling for inferring catchment DOC transport processes, and the importance of considering catchment-specific factors when predicting event-scale DOC behaviour.",,,,,,"Higgins, Scott/0000-0001-9427-7024; Friesen-Hughes, Karl/0000-0003-4476-0100; Casson, Nora/0000-0002-0701-1816",,,,,,,,,,,,,0885-6087,1099-1085,,,,JUL,2021,35,7,,,,,,,e14279,10.1002/hyp.14279,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14279,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000678409000029,View Full Record in Web of Science

The patterns of daily GPP and NPP through time approximated logistic curves under both CO2 treatments. Regression analysis indicated that both the rate of increase (the parameter 'r') and the maximum Value (the parameter 'k') of daily GPP and NPP under the elevated CO2 treatment were significantly higher than under the ambient CO2 treatment. The percentage increase in daily GPP due to elevated CO2 varied systematically through time according to the logistic equations used for the two treatments. The GPP increase due to elevated CO2 ranged from approximately 10% initially to 73% at the peak, while declining to about 33%, as predicted by the ratio of the two maximum values. Different values of percentage increase in GPP and NPP were obtained at different sampling times. This result demonstrated that one-time measurements of percentage increases due to elevated CO2 could be misleading, thereby making interpretation difficult. Although rhizosphere respiration was substantially enhanced by elevated CO2, no effect of elevated CO2 on R: P (respiration:photosynthesis) was found, suggesting an invariant NPP:GPP ratio during the entire experiment. Further validation of the notion of an invariant NPP:GPP ratio may significantly simplify the process of quantifying terrestrial carbon sequestration by directly relating total photosynthesis to net primary production.",,,,,"Cheng, Weixin/F-4968-2011","Cheng, Weixin/0000-0003-2964-2376",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,DEC,2000,6,8,,,,,931,941,,10.1046/j.1365-2486.2000.00367.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2000.00367.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000166524000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies have indicated that some macroalgae have the potential to be used to control bloom-forming microalgae. Here, we report the ability of Pyropia haitanensis, a commercial macroalga cultivated in southeastern China, to inhibit the growth of the common bloom-forming diatom Skeletonema costatum. The results of initial experiments using fresh thalli of P. haitanensis at various temperatures clearly indicated that this macroalga had a high inhibition effect on the growth of S. costatum at 21 degrees C. Therefore, further treatments with fresh thalli, culture filtrate, dry powder and water-soluble extract were used to determine the dose-dependent inhibition effect on the growth of S. costatum at 21 degrees C by P. haitanensis. Fresh thalli were potent and significantly inhibited the growth of S. costatum at all concentrations, but the microalga was alive at a very low density. Treatments with culture filtrate, dry powder and water-soluble extract greatly affected the growth of S. costatum at different concentrations, and no living microalgal cells were found after treatment with the water-soluble extract. The present study was carried out under controlled laboratory conditions excluding fluctuations in light and temperature. Therefore, our results, together with the well-known nutrient removal capacity of macroalgae, allows us to conclude that P. haitanensis contains bioactive compounds and allelopathy is the most likely reason for the negative effect on S. costatum.",,,,,"Chen, Changping/AAU-4352-2020; abate, rediat/F-4552-2016","Chen, Changping/0000-0002-3332-2458; abate, rediat/0000-0002-6035-2548; PATIL, VISHAL/0000-0002-1550-1401",,,,,,,,,,,,,0921-8971,1573-5176,,,,APR,2020,32,2,,,,,1275,1286,,10.1007/s10811-020-02051-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-020-02051-1,,FEB 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000511075800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, weather factors that influence the daily infection risk of cucurbits by P. cubensis have not been determined. Field experiments were conducted from 2012 to 2014 in Clayton, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina under naturally occurring inoculum. Weather factors were monitored during the study during which bioassay cucumber plants were exposed to prevailing weather conditions over a 24- and 48-h period. Disease severity was assessed 7 days after exposure and logistic regression models were developed to predict the probability of disease development on the bioassay plants. Hours of relative humidity >80% and day temperature were identified to be important predictors of the risk of infection for both the 24-h and 48-h cases. Threshold probability (PT) on the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) that minimized the overall error rate for the 24-h and 48-h model was 0.54 and 0.62, respectively. Model accuracy as estimated using area under ROC (AUC) ranged from 0.82 to 0.86, with a correct classification rate ranging from 0.73 to 0.80. Specificity rates of the models ranged from 0.72 to 0.86, while the sensitivity rates ranged from 0.71 to 0.76. External validation of the models using an independent dataset collected in South Carolina, showed good performance of the models with an AUC >0.91. Using estimates of economic damage and costs of management, optimal decision thresholds that minimized the average costs due to disease control and crop loss were determined. Optimal decision thresholds were dependent on disease prevalence and management decisions informed by the models reduced average costs when disease prevalence was <= 0.50 and <= 0.90 for the 24- and 48-h models, respectively. However, the value of using these models for making disease management decisions was greatest at low levels of disease prevalence. The PT for the validation models was 0.2 and under this threshold, the 24-h model had a correct classification, sensitivity and specificity rates of 0.88, 0.91 and 0.71, respectively, and the corresponding values for the 48-h model were 0.98, 0.97 and 1.0, respectively.

Reference crop evapotranspiration (ET (0)) is an important part of water cycle in agricultural ecosystem, which has a direct effect on crop growth and yield. The implications of climate change on ET (0) are of high importance for agriculture regarding water management and irrigation scheduling. The aim of this study was to analyze the variations in climate and its effect on ET (0) in central and western Inner Mongolia over the period 1961 to 2009. For this purpose, data in ten meteorological stations across study area were collected and the FAO Penman-Monteith 56 method was used. Results showed that the average temperature, maximum temperature and minimum temperature increased by 0.49A degrees C, 0.31A degrees C and 0.70A degrees C per decade during 1961-2009, respectively. In comparison, the daily temperature range decreased by 0.38A degrees C per decade. The air relative humidity, sunshine hour, and 10-m wind speed decreased generally by 0.58%, 40.11 h, and 0.35 m/s per decade, respectively. Annual mean ET (0) decreased significantly at a rate of 12.2 mm per decade over the periods, this was mainly due to the decrease in wind speed in the study area. The decrease in wind speed may balance the effect of the increase in air temperature on ET (0). Variations in spatial distribution of ET (0) and its main controlling factor were also detected among ten stations. Our results suggested that spatial and temporal distribution of ET (0) should be considered regarding the optimization of water resource management for agriculture in central and western Inner Mongolia under foreseen climate change.",,,,,"Liu, Yaling/J-8461-2017; He, Di/E-2904-2018","He, Di/0000-0002-0049-5125",,,,,,,,,,,,,2095-0195,2095-0209,,,,DEC,2013,7,4,,,,,417,428,,10.1007/s11707-013-0381-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-013-0381-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000327494400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because of their prominent role in the global carbon balance and their possible role in carbon sequestration, soil microbes are very important organisms in relation to global climate changes. This review focuses mainly on the responses of soil microbes to climate changes and subsequent effects on soil carbon dynamics. An overview table regarding extracellular enzyme activities (EAA) with all relevant literature data summarizes the effects of different ecosystems under various experimental treatments on EAA. Increasing temperature, altered soil moisture regimes, and elevated carbon dioxide significantly affect directly or indirectly soil microbial activities. High temperature regimes can increase the microbial activities which can provide positive feedback to climate change, whereas lower moisture condition in pedosystem can negate the increase, although the interactive effects still remain unanswered. Shifts in soil microbial community in response to climate change have been determined by gene probing, phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), terminal restriction length polymorphism (TRFLP), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), but in a recent investigations, omic technological interventions have enabled determination of the shift in soil microbe community at a taxa level, which can provide very important inputs for modeling C sequestration process.

The spatial model used simulated current velocity, wetland type and water temperature at a high spatial resolution over the entire fluvial St. Lawrence River, Canada. Those three variables were integrated into a habitat suitability index (HSI) and weighted according to the literature. A new thermal preferendum curve, based on a field experiment, was included in the HSI, reflecting that the probability of observing pike spawners in a given area increased with temperature. The reproduction chronology was predicted every year with an original model based on air temperature in order to reconstitute the historic habitat surfaces for the period 1960-2000. The results revealed that discharge had a substantial effect on both suitable habitat for egg deposition and potential mortality following dewatering.

The main reason may be that tree canopies warm up less in the sun and experience lower average temperatures than alpine vegetation. Low growth temperatures limit tissue formation more than carbon gain, but whether this mechanism universally determines potential treeline elevations is the subject of debate. To study low-temperature limitation in two contrasting treeline tree species, Fajardo and Piper (American Journal of Botany 101: 788-795) grew potted seedlings at ground level or suspended at tree-canopy height (2 m), introducing a promising experimental method for studying the effects of alpine-vegetation and tree-canopy microclimates on tree growth. On the basis of this experiment, the authors concluded that lower temperatures at 2 m caused carbon limitation in one of the species and that treeline-forming mechanisms may thus be taxon-dependent. Here we contest that this important conclusion can be drawn based on the presented experiment, because of confounding effects of extreme root-zone temperature fluctuations and potential drought conditions. To interpret the results of this elegant experiment without logistically challenging technical modifications and to better understand how low temperature leads to treeline formation, studies on effects of fluctuating vs. stable temperatures are badly needed. Other treeline research priorities are interactions between temperature and other climatic factors and differences in microclimate between tree canopies with contrasting morphology and physiology. In spite of our criticism of this particular study, we agree that the development of a universal treeline theory should include continuing explorations of taxon-specific treeline-forming mechanisms.",,,,,"Zotz, Gerhard/Q-5365-2018; Bader, Maaike/AAG-4451-2019","Zotz, Gerhard/0000-0002-6823-2268; Bader, Maaike/0000-0003-4300-7598",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9122,1537-2197,,,,SEP,2014,101,9,,,,,1403,1408,,10.3732/ajb.1400256,http://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1400256,,,,,,,,25253701,,,,,WOS:000342536100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The calves had unlimited access to the starter feed and fresh water and remained in the study until weaning on d 51 of age. The average mean temperature-humidity index was 70.1 units (ranging between 61.9 to 78.2) during the experiment, indicating a borderline degree of environmental heat-load. The amount of starter feed offered and refused was recorded daily. The calves were weighed immediately after birth and every 10 d thereafter, before the morning feeding. Jugular blood samples were taken immediately before and 24 h after colostrum feeding, at first month of age, and at wean-ing to quantify serum concentrations of glucose, urea N, cholesterol, triglycerides, total proteins, albumin, globulin, aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, total antioxidant status, and malondialdehyde. Health checks including rectal temperature, general appear-ance (on a 1-5 score system), fecal score (on a 1-5 score system), and bovine respiratory disease (BRD; scored using the University of Wisconsin Calf Health Chart) were performed daily, by a veterinarian who was unaware of the calf treatment allocations, for all calves over the study period. A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare growth performance and blood metabolites among treatment groups, and a logistic regression model using a binomial distribution (PROC GLIMMIX, SAS v. 9.4, SAS Institute Inc.) was used to assess the chance of elevated rectal temperature (>= 39.4 degrees C), general appearance (>= 2), diarrhea (>= 3), and BRD. A Poisson regression model (PROC GEN-MOD) was also used to test group differences in the experience of days with elevated rectal temperature and general appearance, and frequency and duration of diarrhea or BRD. Total nutrient intake (DM, CP, and ME, but not ether extract) originating from milk and starter feed was greater in OLP-(but not FSP-) supplemented calves compared with CON group, be-ing partially associated with difference in milk refusal. Calves receiving FSP and OLP had greater average daily gain, BW gain, skeletal gain (withers height or heart girth, respectively), and feed efficiency compared with CON animals with no difference between FSP and OLP. Rectal temperature was lower in FSP-(but not OLP-) supplemented calves compared with CON animals.

Recent studies have found that body size and thermal ramping rate can affect the estimation of critical thermal limits. However, the effects of both variables and their interactions on the thermal limits of N. fulva and S. invicta have not previously been described. Thus, we evaluated the impacts of body size and ramping rate on the critical thermal limits of N. fulva and S. invicta.

It is correlated with the necessity for these larval stages to be ingested by the blood feeding vector before they can be transmitted to a new vertebrate host. Microfilariae of the dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis have been described to show periodicity, but the circadian pattern does not seem to be consistent. Most publications describe the lowest mff-concentrations in the peripheral blood in the early morning, while the highest counts occurred either in the afternoon, in the late evening or shortly after midnight. Sixteen dogs were experimentally infected with D. immitis isolates originating from Italy (one isolate, 14 dogs), and the USA (two isolates, one dog each). The dogs were housed indoors with a natural light source (windows) and heating that prevented temperature-drops below 20 degrees C during winter. When patency was reached, blood samples were collected at weekly and monthly intervals over a period of up to 3 years, and at given hours of the day (morning, noon, evening) for the duration of one year in order to determine seasonal, as well as daily variations of microfilaremia. Despite the fact that the dogs were kept indoors, there was an apparent seasonality of the D. immitis-microfilaremia, with peaks in summer and 5-49-times lower counts in winter. This difference was statistically significant and the ratio remained constant over the years, regardless of the fact that the mff-counts increased from the first to the second year of patency. Since the temperature was kept constantly in a range between 20 to 26 degrees C (with some single outliners in both directions) the climatic conditions may not explain this observation. Therefore, day length may be the most obvious reason for the seasonality in the given study set-up. Interestingly, the Italian D. immitis-isolate lost seasonality after three passages of experimental infections in dogs. The circadian cycle of mff in the peripheral blood varied considerably between dogs and season.

Irrespective of poor handling and/or prolonged storage of M-EM, seed treatment with M-EM improved germination under optimal conditions for all crops compared to the control. Increased planting depths and cold stress were used to create conditions where seed treatment with M-EM may improve germination and seedling growth. Seed treatment with M-EM significantly improved germination and seedling vigour of the stress-tolerant maize cultivar following cold stress. Similar improved seedling vigour results were observed for the stress-tolerant sunflower cultivar at increased planting depth. It was concluded that the beneficial influence of M-EM as a seed treatment was remarkable, even after exposure of M-EM to unfavourable environmental conditions and prolonged storage before application.

Our analysis is based on surface current data collected in the summer of 2014 using High Frequency (WERA, Helzel Messtechnik GmbH) radar system. One of our objectives was to separate out the tidal from the nontidal components of the currents and to determine the most important tidal constituents. Tides in the Porsanger fjord are substantial, with tidal range on the order of about 3 m. Tidal analysis attributes to tides about 99% of variance in sea level time series recorded in Honningsvaag. The most important tidal component in sea level data is the M2 component, with amplitude of similar to 90 cm. The S2 and N2 constituents (amplitude of similar to 20 cm) also play a significant role in the semidiurnal sea level oscillations. The most important diurnal component is K1 with amplitude of about 8 cm. The most important tidal component in analyzed surface currents records is the M2 component. The second most important component is the S2. Our results indicate that in contrast to sea level, only about 10-30% of variance in surface currents can be attributed to tidal currents.

Using an archive of otoliths spanning 2011-2019, we examined how growth rates of wild subadult delta smelt vary ontogenetically, regionally, and in relation to variation in the physical environment during late-summer and fall in the upper San Francisco Estuary. Recent growth rates were quantified using otolith increment analysis and modeled as functions of both intrinsic (age) and extrinsic (temperature, salinity, clarity, and region) factors using a suite of generalized additive models. Age explained 60% of the variation in log(10)-transformed growth rates, which peaked at 50-80 d post hatch. Overall, age-adjusted growth rates declined at temperatures >20 degrees C, increased with practical salinity values of 0-4, and exhibited interactive patterns with water clarity. Growth rates appeared highest in the West and Central Delta, and lowest in the North Delta, also corresponding with patterns in environmental conditions. Here, we provide new evidence for how vital rates of wild delta smelt vary spatially and in relation to abiotic environmental variation. Such otolith-based growth reconstructions often provide the first direct look at how the vital rates of wild fish respond to environmental variation in situ, and how future changes are likely to affect the dynamics of wild populations.",,,,,,"Fichman, Rachel/0000-0002-0184-3961",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,OCT 14,2021,676,,,,,,37,56,,10.3354/meps13848,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps13848,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000714439800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a consequence of very large egg size (minimum 1.4 mm), fecundity was low, ranging from 83 to 608 eggs per female (carapace length [CL] 11 -22.5 mm). Egg size increased continuously throughout embryonic development, reaching prior to hatching about 175% of the initial diameter. Due to low daily numbers of larval release, hatching of an egg batch lasted for about 2-3 weeks. The complete larval and early juvenile development was studied in laboratory cultures fed with Artenlia sp. nauplii. At 7.0 +/- 0.5 degreesC, development from hatching to metamorphosis lasted for about 6 weeks. It comprised invariably two large zoeal stages and one decapodid, with mean stage durations of 12, 17, and 15 days, respectively. Larvae maintained without food survived on average for 18 days (maximum: 29 days), but did not reach the moult to the zoea 11 stage. Size increments at ecdysis were low in all larval stages (2.1-3.9%), indicating partial utilisation of internal energy reserves. A clearly higher increment (14%) was observed in the moult from the first to the second juvenile stage. Low fecundity, large size of eggs and larvae, an abbreviated mode of larval development, high larval survival rates during absence of food, demersal behaviour of the early life history stages, and an extended hatching period with low daily release rates are interpreted as adaptations to conditions typically prevailing in subantarctic regions, namely low temperatures (causing long durations of development) in combination with a pronounced seasonality in plankton production (i.e., short periods of food availability).

Post-partum, concentrate proportion was adjusted to 50% while fat supplementation continued. Compared with adapted feeding, high concentrate proportions antepartum tended to increase DMI and reduced RpH. Groups CON-60 and CLA-60 spent more than 4 h per day below RpH 5.6 during late pregnancy, indicating the presence of subacute rumen acidosis (SARA). The RT remained unaffected antepartum. Before calving, cows spent less time below RpH 5.6 and SARA could be detected in each group post-partum. Mean RpH increased slightly antepartum, whereas few hours before parturition a sharp decrease in RpH could be observed, accompanied with increased RT. Overall, it seems that CLA supplementation influences RpH and RT.

However, little is known about the factors determining the formation of condensation over long term, especially in desert oases in arid areas. During 2005-2014, we investigated the main limiting factors in formation of condensation water for five different surfaces (interdune, dune top, flat vegetation-free sand, artificial grassland and plantation forest), sand particle sizes, and temperature and humidity control experiment in a typical arid region of north-western China. Results showed that changes in microhabitat resulting from different surface conditions had a significant influence on the amount of condensation water in arid desert ecosystem. Except for sand particle sizes 0.2-0.02 and 2-0.2 mm, the amount of average daily condensation for different sand particle sizes differed significantly (P < 0.05) and decreased with an increase in sand particle size. Air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), air and surface temperature range (RT) and wind speed (WS) can significantly (P < 0.05) affect the formation of condensation water in arid regions, and the thresholds of condensation water formation were RH > 25% and WS < 3.50 m s(-1). Such effects, however, differed among the different surfaces due to different conditions of soil characteristics, microhabitats and regional climate. These results suggest that the influence of site characteristics, microhabitats and regional climate on the formation of condensation water should attract more attention and that both the relative importance and the interactions among different determining factors will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanistic determinants for the formation of condensation water in arid areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0584,1936-0592,,,,JUL,2020,13,5,,,,,,,e2226,10.1002/eco.2226,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2226,,JUN 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000538722000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This was accomplished by examining the mortality of barnacle cyprids from settlement to metamorphosis, as well as mortality of early juveniles up to the age of 10 d after metamorphosis. A field survey of B. glandula recruitment was conducted from 1 to 23 June 2011 at Wizard Islet in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada We also documented the range of weather-related abiotic conditions that occurred in the intertidal zone during the recruitment survey. These weather-related abiotic conditions were highly variable during the survey, indicating that each daily cohort of barnacle settlers experienced conditions after settlement that differed from those experienced by the other daily cohorts. Cyprid cohort mortality was high, averaging 52.7 +/- 22.7% (SD), and differed greatly among the daily cohorts. Contrary to expectations, cyprid mortality was not significantly influenced by weather-related abiotic conditions. This was likely due to the study being conducted during a La Nina cycle that may have had lower temperature and desiccation levels than are typical for Barkley Sound. Overall, an average of 70.6 +/- 16.3% (SD) of all metamorphosed individuals were alive 10 d after metamorphosis. Although the direct cause of high mortality could not be determined, Fucus spp. cover negatively influenced the survival of both newly-settled cyprids and juveniles. A decline of fucoid algae populations due to changing climate may therefore result in an increase in barnacle survival through the early benthic phase and may subsequently affect annual variation in barnacle population abundance.

However, the magnitude and direction of changes in NDVI have not been consistent across different tundra types. Here we examine the responsiveness of fine-scale NDVI values to experimental warming at eight sites in northern Alaska, United States. Warming in our eight sites ranged in duration from 2-23 seasons. Dry, wet and moist tundra communities were monitored for canopy surface temperatures and NDVI in ambient and experimentally-warmed plots at near-daily frequencies during the summer of 2017 to assess the impact of the warming treatment on the magnitude and timing of greening. Experimental warming increased canopy-level surface temperatures across all sites (+0.47 to +3.14 & x2da;C), with the strongest warming effect occurring during June and July and for the southernmost sites. Green-up was accelerated by warming at six sites, and autumn senescence was delayed at five sites. Warming increased the magnitude of peak NDVI values at five sites, decreased it at one site, and at two sites it did not change. Warming resulted in earlier peak NDVI at three sites and no significant change in the other sites. Shrub and graminoid cover was positively correlated with the magnitude of peak NDVI (r=0.37 to 0.60) while cryptogam influence was mixed. The magnitude and timing of peak NDVI showed considerable variability across sites. Warming extended the duration of the summer green season at most sites due to accelerated greening in the spring and delayed senescence in the autumn. We show that in a warmer Arctic (as simulated by our experiment) the timing and total period of carbon gain may change.

Specifically, adaptation to fluctuating temperatures (16-25 degrees C) decreased tolerance of extreme heat. Surprisingly, flies adapted to a constant temperature of 25 degrees C had greater cold tolerance than did flies adapted to other thermal conditions, including a constant temperature of 16 degrees C. As our populations were never exposed to extreme temperatures during selection, divergence of thermal tolerance likely reflects indirect selection of standing genetic variation via linkage or pleiotropy.

Many organisms have evolved with seasonality, characterized as initiation-termination-reinitiation of several physiological processes (i.e., body fattening, molt, plumage coloration, reproduction, etc). It is an adaptation for the survival of many species. Predominantly seasonal breeders use photoperiod as the most reliable environmental cue to adapt to seasonal changes but supplementary factors like temperature and food are synergistically involved in seasonal processes. Studies from diverse vertebrate systems have contributed to understanding the mechanism involved in seasonal reproduction at the molecular and endocrine levels. Long-day induced thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone) released from the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland triggers local thyroid hormone activation within the mediobasal hypothalamus. This locally produced thyroid hormone, T3, regulates seasonal gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. Most of the bird species studied are seasonal in reproduction and linked behavior and, therefore, need to adjust reproductive decisions to environmental fluctuations. Reproductive strategies of the temperate zone breeders are well-documented, but less is known about tropical birds' reproduction and factors stimulating the annual breeding strategies.

Larvae were reared in glass aquaria and plastic tubs under aerated conditions at water temperatures from 25 degreesC to 29 degreesC. Live food ( Artentia of different size ranges) was given to excess on various feeding schedules. Larvae were also fed combinations of live (Artemia) and prepared food; larvae were switched to prepared food on day 6, 11, and 16 after receiving Artemia from the onset of exogenous feeding. Larvae fed Artemia had high growth and survival. Prepared food was acceptable at the start of exogenous feeding but resulted in relatively poor growth and survival. Artemia in the size range from 160 to 315 mu are more suitable for C.,macrocephalus larvae than sizes < 160 <mu> A schedule of one feeding per day is satisfactory if feeding is in excess. Live food was necessary at the start of exogenous feeding to improve survival. Larvae fed Artemia from the start of exogenous feeding until day 11, followed by prepared food until the end of the experiment, grew significantly faster and had better survival than those fed other food combinations, Artemia, or prepared food alone. The results indicate that simple changes in culture procedures can improve the production of C. macrocephalus larvae. Larvae should be fed once daily on an excess of Artemia in the size range from 160 to 315 mu from first feeding to day 10, followed by prepared food in powder form from day 11 to 21.

Kinetics of DIC acquisition, measured with a liquid-phase oxygen electrode, showed higher K (1/2)(DIC) (0.31 mM) and Vm (7.78 nmol min(-1) A mu g (Chl a)(-1)) for MPB suspensions than for P. tricornutum (K (1/2)(DIC) = 0.23 mM; Vm = 4.64 nmol min(-1) A mu g (Chl a)(-1)), suggesting the predominance of species with lower affinity for DIC and higher photosynthetic capacity in the MPB. The net photosynthetic rate of the MPB suspensions reached saturation at a DIC concentration of 1-1.5 mM. This range was lower than the concentrations found in the interstitial water of the top 5-mm sediment layer, suggesting no limitation of photosynthesis by DIC in the MPB communities. Accordingly, carbon isotope discrimination revealed a moderate activity of CO2-concentrating mechanisms in the MPB. However, addition of NaHCO3 to intact MPB biofilms caused a significant increase in the relative maximum photosynthetic electron transport rate (rETR (max)) measured by imaging pulse-amplitude modulated chlorophyll a fluorescence. These results suggest local depletion of DIC at the photic layer of the sediment (the first few hundred A mu m), where MPB cells accumulate during diurnal low tides.

Predawn leaf water potential at the top of climbing ivy ranged from -0.4 to -0.6 MPa, daily minima ranged from -1.3 to -1.7 MPa. Leaf water potentials as well as relative sap flow were held surprisingly constant throughout different weather conditions, suggesting a tendency to isohydric behaviour. Maximum stomatal conductance was 200 mmol m(-2) s(-1). The use of a potometer experiment allowed us to measure absolute transpiration rates integrated over a whole plant of 0.23 mmol m(-2) s(-1). Nightly sap flow of ivy during warm, dry nights accounted for up to 20% of the seasonal maximum. Maximum sap flow rates were reached at ca. 0.5 kPa vpd. On the other hand, the host trees showed a less conservative stomatal regulation, maximum sap flow rates were reached at vpd values of ca. 1 kPa. Sap flow rates of ivy decreased by ca. 20% in spring after bud break of trees, suggesting that ivy profits strongly from warm sunny days in early spring before budbreak of the host trees and from mild winter days.

We determined the predictive ability of phenological models, derived from glasshouse studies and driven by temperature and photoperiod, across a diverse range of cover crop genotypes and tropical hillside environments. The models were designed to predict the duration from germination to first flowering, and from first flowering to first pod maturity. Seeds of eleven legume species of cover and/or green manure crops collected from different hillside locations world-wide were sown in two groups of nurseries (tropical short-day plants in early summer and sub-tropical long-day plants in early winter) at Kabale and Namulonge in Uganda, Godavari and Lumle in Nepal, Cochabamba in Bolivia, Zamorano in Honduras, and Valenca in Brazil. Dates of sowing, first flowering and first pod maturity were taken and daily temperature data were recorded at each site.

BEANGRO is such a versatile, user-friendly simulation model for dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). It is written in the FORTRAN computer language and operates on personal computers. The flexible user interface allows researchers to specify diverse model inputs and outputs, easily compare simulation results with observed data, and conduct simulation experiments interactively through menu-driven options for sensitivity analysis. BEANGRO follows the standard file formats of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) software system, and may be used within DSSAT to assess effects of different agricultural management practices for runs over multiple years using either historical or generated weather data. The model responds to environmental variables (including air temperature, solar radiation, precipitation, and soil moisture retention characteristics), as well as to crop management conditions. Cultivar traits are specified through an input file, and traits may be modified interactively. BEANGRO operates at daily time steps and simulates bean growth and development from planting until harvest maturity. This traditional process-oriented dry bean model and its user interface has created an interest among nontraditional modeler users and has been distributed to researchers for application in various projects, ranging from land-use planning to plant breeding and plant physiology.",,,,,"Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537; Boote, Kenneth/0000-0002-1358-5496",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-1962,1435-0645,,,,JAN-FEB,1994,86,1,,,,,182,190,,10.2134/agronj1994.00021962008600010032x,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1994.00021962008600010032x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994MZ16600035,View Full Record in Web of Science

This establishment period may have the greatest mortality of all life stages until death of mature trees by disease or fire. Spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution and survival of seedlings of Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa were evaluated over four years in an alpine-treeline ecotone of the Snowy Range, Wyoming, USA. Seedlings and saplings of both species occurred most frequently near islands of adult trees. For P. englemannii, this appeared partly due to decreased survivorship of young seedlings (< 5 cm height) with greater distance away from tree islands. Survival of emergents of P. engelmannii was 28% greater on the north compared to south sides of tree islands, 48% lower on south-facing slopes compared to other aspects, and 70% greater with overhead cover such as tree branches. Survival of emergents was greater in microsites with grass cover (90% survival) compared to without ground cover (44% survival), but lowest in microsites surrounded, but not covered, by grass (19%). From 1994-1999, natural seedling emergence and survival was highest in 1995 (80% survival of 221 P. engelmannii, and 100% of seven A. lasiocarpa, in a sample area of 432 m 2), when the smallest mean difference in daily maximum and minimum temperatures occurred, and lowest in 1994 (30% of seven P. engelmannii), when above-average temperatures were accompanied by low rainfall and clear skies. The growth seasons of 1994 and 1995 had among the lowest and highest precipitation of the previous 30-year period, respectively. In an artificial seeding experiment, less than 20% of seedlings of both species survived their first complete year of growth. In the autumn of the second year, almost 25% additional mortality was observed in the remaining experimental seedlings when they were exposed to clear, cold skies without the normal protection of snowcover.

We use 14 years of field survey data from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest to fit simple models of canopy phenology for three northern hardwood species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). These models are then run with historical meteorological data to investigate potential climate change effects on phenology. Development and senescence are quantified using an index that ranges from 0 (dormant, no leaves) to 4 (full, green canopy). Sugar maple is the first species to leaf out in the spring, whereas American beech is the last species to drop its leaves in the fall. Across an elevational range from 250 to 825 m ASL, the onset of spring is delayed by 2.7 +/- 0.4 days for every 100 m increase in elevation, which is in reasonable agreement with Hopkin's law. More than 90% of the variation in spring canopy development, and just slightly less than 90% of the variation in autumn canopy senescence, is accounted for by a logistic model based on accumulated degree-days. However, degree-day based models fit to Hubbard Brook data appear to overestimate the rate at which spring development occurs at the more southerly Harvard Forest. Autumn senescence at the Harvard Forest can be predicted with reasonable accuracy in sugar maple but not American beech. Retrospective modeling using five decades (1957-2004) of Hubbard Brook daily mean temperature data suggests significant trends (P <= 0.05) towards an earlier spring (e.g. sugar maple, rate of change=0.18 days earlier/yr), consistent with other studies documenting measurable climate change effects on the onset of spring in both North America and Europe.

We used the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhite) as a model species for studying how microclimates serve as refuge against severe weather conditions. This species serves as an indicator or umbrella species for other sensitive ground-nesting, grassland obligate species. We conducted a mensurative field experiment in the rolling plains of Texas, USA, a semi-arid ecosystem on the southwestern periphery of bobwhite range, to determine whether native bunch grasses, apparently suitable for bobwhite nesting, could reduce ambient temperature below levels harmful for eggs. During the nesting season, we compared temperature and relative humidity readings at daily heat maxima (i.e., the 3 h during each day with highest temperatures) during the nesting season over the course of two years at 63 suitable nest sites paired with 63 random locations (n = 126) using two sensors at similar to 10 and similar to 60 cm above ground level. Mean temperature at nest height was 2.3% cooler at nest sites (35.99 degrees C +/- 0.07 SE) compared to random locations (36.81 degrees C +/- 0.07 SE); at ambient height, nest sites were slightly cooler (32.78 degrees C +/- 0.06 SE) than random location (32.99 degrees C +/- 0.06 SE). Mean relative humidity at nest sites was greater at nest height (34.53% +/- 0.112 SE) and ambient height (36.22% +/- 0.10 SE) compared to random locations at nest (33.35% +/- 0.12 SE) and ambient height (35.75% +/- 0.10 SE). Based on these results, cover at sites that appear visually suitable for nesting by bobwhites and other ground nesting birds provided adequate thermal refuge in the rolling plains by maintaining cooler, moister microclimates than surrounding non-nesting locations. Post-hoc analyses of data revealed that habitat conditions surrounding suitable nest sites strongly influenced thermal suitability of the substrate. Given that eggs of bobwhites and probably other species would experience lethal temperatures without these thermal refuges in the context of proper habitat condition, nesting vegetation is a critical component of niche space for bobwhites and other ground nesting birds in semi-arid regions. Many contemporary land uses, however, degrade or destroy bunch grasses and grassland systems, and thus decrease landscape inhabitability. Conservationists working with obligate grassland species that require bunch grasses in semi-arid regions should develop land management strategies that maximize the availability of these thermal refuges across space and time.",,,,,,"Peterson, Markus/0000-0001-6145-0134; Reyna, Kelly/0000-0003-3202-2135",,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,AUG 18,2017,5,,,,,,,,e3709,10.7717/peerj.3709,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3709,,,,,,,,28828282,,,,,WOS:000411947500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fine root respiration rates were in the range of 0.5 - 9.8 nmol CO2 gDW(-1) s(-1) at both sites, but respiration rates of UND saplings were higher, compared to those of GAP saplings. The dependence of respiratory activity on soil temperature proved to be highly significant (p < 0.001) for both plots, following a quasi-Arrhenius type curve. Fine root respiration rates of UND saplings were highly significantly, negatively correlated with the water content of the attached organic material, whereas respiration rates of GAP saplings did not show such a correlation. Further, a significant correlation (p < 0.01) between mycorrhizal biomass and respiration rate was detected at the UND site, but not at the GAP site. Medium and coarse root respiration rates were very similar and no significant differences between the two sites were detected. Maximum respiration rates of 3.1 nmol CO2 gDW(-1) s(-1) were reached in the middle of July. Due to low light intensities in the under storey, daily net CO2 assimilation rates of UND saplings were much smaller than those of GAP saplings.

Females lay eggs in the root crown for >3 mo. The slow accumulation of eggs in plants poses problems in defining cohorts for modeling larval development under fluctuating temperatures. The total number of immature individuals per plant was assessed throughout the whole reproduction period during a 4-yr study. Two supplementary data sets were collected in 1994 and 1996. Total insect population density plotted against degree-days (in base 10) differed among years. The speed at which the population maximum was reached was steeper during wet years than during dry years. The hypothesis was that the differences in slopes were caused by drought stresses, which were known to influence egg laying from experiments in controlled conditions. A model based on the Weibull distribution and describing the growth of insect population density per plant from the beginning of egg laying to maximum density is proposed. The insect population density is expressed as the cumulative proportion of individuals found in plants, varying in the interval (0,1). The initial degree-day scale is corrected by a coefficient linked to the upper soil water content. This correction ensured a good concordance among years and places. The model predicted correctly the dynamics of plant infestation under variable climatic conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,OCT,1997,26,5,,,,,1031,1039,,10.1093/ee/26.5.1031,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/26.5.1031,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997YH73300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a beneficial management practice to sustain soil fertility and crop productivity, partial substitution of organic fertilizers (OFs) for synthetic fertilizers (SFs) can directly affect this balance status and regulate N2O emissions. However, no multi-year field studies of N2O emissions under different ratios of OFs to SFs have been performed. We conducted a 4-year experiment to measure N2O emissions in a maize-wheat rotation in central China. Six treatments were included: total SF (TS), total OF, no N fertilizer, and ratios of to SF with 1: 2 (LO), 1: 1 (MO), and 2: 1 (HO), based on N content. Two incubation experiments were performed to further interpret the field data. In the first year, cumulative N2O emissions (kg N ha(-1)) in LO, MO, and HO were 4.59, 4.68, and 3.59, respectively, significantly lower than in TS (6.67). However, from the second year onwards, organic substitution did not reduce N2O emissions and even significantly enhanced them in the fourth year relative to TS. Soil respiration under OF-amended soils increased over the course of the experiment. From the second year onwards, there was no marked difference in mineral N concentrations between OF- and SF-amended soils. OF caused a drop in soil pH. Cumulative N2O was negatively correlated with pH. Long-term organic substitution enhanced N2O emissions produced via denitrification rather than nitrification and resulted in higher temperature sensitivity of N2O emissions than TS. The enhanced N2O emissions from the OF-treated soils were mainly attributable to accelerated OF decomposition, increased denitrification-N2O emissions, and lessened N2O reduction due to lower pH and greater NO3-. These results indicate that OF substitution can reduce N2O emissions in the first year, but in the long-term it can increase emissions, especially as soils warm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0301-4797,1095-8630,,,,JUN 1,2020,263,,,,,,,,110384,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110384,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110384,,,,,,,,32174526,,,,,WOS:000530232700020,View Full Record in Web of Science

When Wolbachia infections are at a high frequency, they influence the local transmission of dengue by direct virus blocking as well as deleterious effects on vector mosquito populations. However, the effectiveness of this strategy could be influenced by environmental temperatures that decrease Wolbachia density, thereby reducing the ability of Wolbachia to invade and persist in the population and block viruses. We reared wMel-infected Ae. aegypti larvae in the field during the wet season in Cairns, North Queensland. Containers placed in the shade produced mosquitoes with a high Wolbachia density and little impact on cytoplasmic incompatibility. However, in 50% shade where temperatures reached 39 degrees C during the day, wMel-infected males partially lost their ability to induce cytoplasmic incompatibility and females had greatly reduced egg hatch when crossed to infected males. In a second experiment under somewhat hotter conditions (>40 degrees C in 50% shade), field-reared wMel-infected females had their egg hatch reduced to 25% when crossed to field-reared wMel-infected males. Wolbachia density was reduced in 50% shade for both sexes in both experiments, with some mosquitoes cleared of their Wolbachia infections entirely. To investigate the critical temperature range for the loss of Wolbachia infections, we held Ae. aegypti eggs in thermocyclers for one week at a range of cyclical temperatures. Adult wMel density declined when eggs were held at 26-36 degrees C or above with complete loss at 30-40 degrees C, while the density of wAlbB remained high until temperatures were lethal. These findings suggest that high temperature effects on Wolbachia are potentially substantial when breeding containers are exposed to partial sunlight but not shade. Heat stress could reduce the ability of Wolbachia infections to invade mosquito populations in some locations and may compromise the ability of Wolbachia to block virus transmission in the field. Temperature effects may also have an ecological impact on mosquito populations given that a proportion of the population becomes self-incompatible. Author summary Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia symbionts are being deployed in the tropics as a way of reducing disease transmission. Some Wolbachia strains are vulnerable to high temperatures but these effects have not been evaluated outside of a laboratory setting. We reared Ae. aegypti infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia in the field during the wet season in Cairns, Australia, where the first releases of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti took place. wMel-infected mosquitoes became partially self-incompatible, with reduced egg hatch, when larvae were reared in partial shade where maximum daily temperatures exceeded 39 degrees C. Under these conditions the amount of Wolbachia in adult mosquitoes was reduced to less than 1% of laboratory-reared mosquitoes on average, while some mosquitoes were cleared of Wolbachia entirely. In contrast, wMel was stable when mosquitoes were reared under cooler conditions in full shade. Field trials with the wMel strain are now underway in over 10 countries, but high temperatures in some locales may constrain the ability of Wolbachia to invade natural mosquito populations and block disease transmission.",,,,,"Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019; Ross, Perran/O-1049-2015","Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645; Ross, Perran/0000-0001-7645-7523",,,,,,,,,,,,,1935-2735,,,,,APR,2019,13,4,,,,,,,e0007357,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007357,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007357,,,,,,,,31002720,,,,,WOS:000466742100058,View Full Record in Web of Science

The environmental factors influencing seedling establishment differ between the fellfield and snowbed habitats plants growing in each habitat may therefore have different germination strategies. Using a reciprocal sowing experiment, patterns of seedling emergence and survivorship were examined in both habitat types in the Taisetsu Mountains, Japan. Seeds derived from a fellfield population germinated earlier than did those derived from a snowbed population at both habitats, and the germination of fellfield seeds continued throughout the growing season. The timing of seedling emergence greatly affected subsequent survival at the fellfield. Seedlings that emerged in the first half of the growing season had low survivorship during the first year because of frost and drought damage, but the remaining seedlings had high survivorship during the winter: seedlings that emerged in the latter half of the growing season showed the opposite trend. At the snowbed, seedling survival was high throughout the growing season. Germination experiments in the laboratory highlighted a difference in the sensitivity of seeds from the fellfield and snowbed populations to fluctuating, temperatures. These results indicate that intraspecific variation in emergence and survivorship may occur over a small scale in in alpine environment.

For the calibration step, experimental snow covered area data are needed. Potential uses of the model are to estimate the snow covered area when satellite data are absent, or when they provide a temporal resolution different from the operational resolution, or when the satellite images are useless because they are covered by clouds or because there has been a sensor failure. Another interesting application is the simulation of SCA dynamics for the snow covered area under future climatic scenarios.

The WinRHIZO system and the HYDRUS-1D model were used to identify a promising irrigation schedule. In this two-factor experiment, three irrigation methods, i.e., sprinkler irrigation (SI), surface drip irrigation (SDI) and surface flooding (SF), were scheduled to irrigate the crop as soon as the soil water content decreased to 70%, 60% and 50% of the field capacity. The results showed that both the irrigation method and irrigation schedule influenced root development, the profile root distribution pattern and the profile root water uptake (RWU). The soil surface temperature fluctuated very rapidly depending on the irrigation method and scheduling system used, whereas profile soil temperature fluctuations became more consistent with depth. The RWU was higher in the upper soil layer (0-60 cm) for all irrigation methods for frequently irrigated treatments, and the maximum was observed in SDI compared to SI and SF due to the higher root length density (RLD) in the top soil under SDI. On the other hand, the RWU was higher in SF at a deep soil profile below 60 cm, where it had a higher RLD compared to that of SI and SDI. SDI at 60% of FC not only improved water uptake but also resulted in better water productivity and produced the highest grain yield (9.53 t/ha). The simulated RWU and soil water dynamics presented in this paper will be helpful to improve winter wheat production in the NCP and can be used as a reference for further research on water management practices.

Milk production was recorded twice a day (7:00 and 15:00) throughout the lactation period (January June) in three flocks (FL) kept in the same experimental farm but grazed different pasture areas. The first flock (FLNA) was composed of Nera di Arbus dairy ewes managed conventionally; the second flock (FLsD) was composed of Sarda dairy ewes managed conventionally; and the third flock (FLORG) was a mixed flock of Nera di Arbus and Sarda dairy sheep raised under organic management. Daily MF and some biometeorological indices, i.e. Wind Chill Index (WCI), Temperature Humidity Index (THI) and derived indices, were evaluated by using hourly data recorded 24 h before the last milking of each day and also 1, 2 and 3 days before milking in winter and spring. Data on main MF associated with the morning and afternoon milkings were analyzed using the hourly data from 15:00 of the previous day to 6:00 of the day of milking and from 7:00 to 14:00 of the day of milking, respectively. The interaction between FL and MF was not significant in winter and spring. Milk yield was influenced by most of the MF studied, especially minimum, average and maximum air temperature in both seasons and, to a lesser extent, permanence at temperatures below 0 degrees C and 3 degrees C in winter and above 25 degrees C in spring. The highest milk yield was related to the following optimal ranges: 6-12 degrees C (T-min), 6-15 degrees C (T-avg) and 12-21 degrees C (Tmax) in winter and 9-12 degrees C (T-min), 12-18 degrees C (T-avg) and 15-24 degrees C (T-max) in spring. In winter, daily milk yield was negatively affected by WCI and the persistency of WCI at values lower or equal to 1. In spring, milk yield decreased at average and maximum THI higher than 65 and 68, respectively, and as hours of permanence at Mild -Discomfort level and Discomfort level increased. Wind speed equal to or higher than 2.5 m/s in winter and 4 m/s in spring and maximum wind speed equal to or above 8 m/s in both seasons were detrimental to milk yield. Average wind values between 1.5 and 4 m/s had a beneficial effect in spring. Radiation above 24 MJ/m2 was detrimental to milk yield in spring, whereas rain had a negative effect only in winter. Milk yield reductions were as high as 19% for 17% (max,) T-avg and 15% for minimum WCI (WCI,) in winter, and 19% for Tatax, and 17% for both Trnin and maximum THI (THI,aar) in spring. The ewes responded immediately (Od and 1d) to almost all unfavourable conditions in winter, whereas the timing of responses was more variable during spring. A lag effect of rainfall was detected. The 0-2d period before milking was the most influencing for most relevant MF in both seasons. When comparing the morning and afternoon milkings, the dairy ewes were more sensitive to low temperatures before the afternoon milking in winter, and to higher temperatures before the morning milking in spring.

Sixty Holstein cows, 27 multiparous and 33 primiparous, were blocked by parity and milk yield in the first 20 d in milk (DIM) and randomly assigned to receive 0, 0.5, or 1.0 g/d of LY, resulting in daily intakes of 0, 14.2, and 37.6 billion cells, respectively, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CNCM I-1077 from 30 to 107 DIM. Cows were milked twice daily, dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were measured daily, and milk components, body weight, and body condition were measured weekly. Blood was sampled weekly and plasma analyzed for concentrations of glucose, fatty acids, urea N, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, and acid-soluble protein. Digestibility of nutrients was measured in the last 2 wk of the experiment. Ruminal fluid was collected on 2 consecutive days 6 h after the morning feeding for measurements of pH, concentrations of short chain fatty acids, and NH3-N. Feeding behavior was observed for 48 h on experiment d 21 and 63. The mean ambient temperature was 26.8 degrees C, humidity was 83.2%, and the temperature and humidity index ranged from 73 to 81. Treatment did not affect rectal temperature (38.9 +/- 0.04 degrees C) or DMI but increased yield of energy-corrected milk (ECM; 35.2 vs. 36.1 vs. 37.2 kg/d for 0, 0.5, and 1.0 g/d, respectively) and efficiency of conversion of DM into ECM (1.70, 1.79, and 1.83 for 0, 0.5, and 1 g/d, respectively). Feeding LY increased digestibility of crude Protein (65.1 vs. 68.8 vs. 70.4%) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF; 47.5 vs. 49.2 vs. 55.2%), and concentration of acetate (64.7 vs. 69.1 vs. 72.2 mM), which resulted in increased concentration of total short chain fatty acids in ruminal fluid (110.3 vs. 117.7 vs. 121.4 mM). Mean ruminal pH increased (5.99 vs. 6.03 vs. 6.26), and proportion of cows with pH <5.8 decreased linearly (42.9 vs. 34.9 vs. 7.7%) with increasing inclusion of LY. Concentrations of acute-phase proteins decreased with increasing amount of LY. Some aspects of feeding behavior were altered by LY, and meal size reduced quadratically (3.2, 3.5, and 2.9 kg of DM, respectively), whereas interval between rumination bouts tended to reduce linearly (122, 96.5, and 90.7 min, respectively) with increasing dose of LY. Chewing time per kilogram of NDF tended to increase linearly (71.6, 71.3, and 81.6 min/kg, respectively) with increasing dose of LY. The estimated net energy for lactation of the diet increased 5.2%, from 1.72 Mcal/kg of DM for 0 g of LY to 1.81 Mcal/kg for 1 g of LY. Feeding 1 g of LY/d to cows under heat stress increased yield of ECM and efficiency of feed conversion into ECM, improved diet digestibility, and increased ruminal fluid pH; these responses might be related either to direct effects of LY on rurnirial microbial activity or to changes in feeding behavior that improved digestion of cows in heat stress.",,,,,"Favoreto, Mauricio/GPF-5891-2022; Santos, José Eduardo P./K-5564-2013","Favoreto, Mauricio/0000-0003-4869-8922; Santos, José Eduardo P./0000-0003-3403-1465; Perdomo, Milerky/0000-0003-3998-8709",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0302,1525-3198,,,,JAN,2020,103,1,,,,,325,339,,10.3168/jds.2019-17303,http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2019-17303,,,,,,,,31677835,,,,,WOS:000504824000032,View Full Record in Web of Science

Modeling hydrological processes for hilly catchments dominated by snow cover and glaciers is complex and relies on improved calibration and uncertainty analysis methods to standardize the watershed based ecosystem management practices. In this study, a modified curve number (CN) approach has been employed to simulate streamflow and water yield at sub-catchment scale over hundred years utilizing Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which relies on the main physical factors of the ecosystem such as landuse/landcover and soil. The model calibration and validation strength was evaluated using coefficients of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe Equation (NSE) objective functions. The uncertainties (percentage) occurred in the modeled streamflow were estimated using two optimization algorithms such as the Sequential Uncertainty Parameter Fitting Approach (SUFI2) and the Parametric Solution (ParaSol). A parameterization based sensitivity analysis was carried-out to recognize the most influencing model calibration parameters. Statistical downscaling of daily temperature and precipitation datasets was performed utilizing Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase Five (CMIP5) Global Circulation Models (GCMs) with their Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) experiments. The downscaled temperature and precipitation were utilized to assess the climate change impact on streamflows at sub-catchment scale. The historical and projected scenarios of streamflow (at the outlet) and water yield (at sub-catchment scale) showed substantial variabilities in their amount in both temporal (1991-2100) and spatial scales (sub-catchment 1 to sub-catchment 7). The magnitude of change analysis confirmed a substantial increase in the water yield across all the sub-catchments over Himalaya. The percent of change analysis ensured that the magnitude of change of water yield is highly vulnerable in the Himalayan catchments. The GCMs based projected scenarios demonstrated a consistent increase in the streamflow at both outlets (e.g. Lachung and Chungthang). The overall results show a consistent increase in precipitation and water yield amount over the Himalayan catchments. The variable streamflow in terms of amount and intensity may disrupt the ecosystem services in the Himalayan catchments.",,,,,,"Goyal, Manish Kumar/0000-0001-9777-6128",,,,,,,,,,,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,NOV,2017,108,,A,,,,17,29,,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.002,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000412127500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the model's performance in terms of predicting N2O emissions was mainly assessed against total emissions per growing season or year, which may reduce accuracy in modelling due to the uncertainties in total emissions estimated using the manual (static) chamber method. OBJECTIVE: Here, a comparison between optimizations for Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) with total N2O emissions and daily N2O emissions was conducted. We further used the validated model to develop simple surrogate models for estimating total N2O emissions in different years and target potential opportunities to reduce N2O emissions while still maintaining the grain yield under long-term climatic conditions. METHODS: Five parameters relating to denitrification and nitrification were optimized using differential evolution algorithm for global optimization based on two-year field experimental data at Huantai site in North China Plain, and comprehensive simulation experiments were further conducted under long-term climate variability in an irrigated wheat-maize rotation system. The method of Levenberg-Marquardt was implemented to fit simple surrogate models for estimating total N2O emissions in different years, and Analysis of Variance was used for model comparison. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: APSIM model optimized with daily N2O emissions could better simulate soil N2O and nitrate dynamics than that optimized with total N2O emissions. We obtained the posterior distributions of five key parameters to which N2O emissions are sensitive, and demonstrated that original model using default parameters could underestimate the rate of nitrification and denitrification and the subsequent N2O emissions. Total N2O emissions increased exponentially with nitrogen application rate and mean temperature, and IPCC (1% emission factor) could underestimate whole-year N2O emissions when N rate was higher than the optimized nitrogen rate for crop production. We also found that there was potential to optimize nitrogen fertiliser rate to reduce N2O emissions while still maintaining crop yield in the irrigated wheat-maize rotation system. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrated the necessity of optimization with daily N2O emissions in improving model accuracy, and the posterior distributions of five parameters relating to N2O emissions offered reference range for future model improvement and applications.",,,,,"Luo, Zhongkui/B-8125-2008; Wang, Enli/K-7478-2012","Luo, Zhongkui/0000-0002-6744-6491; Wang, Enli/0000-0002-6653-5791",,,,,,,,,,,,,0308-521X,1873-2267,,,,DEC,2021,194,,,,,,,,103277,10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103277,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103277,,SEP 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000701028300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Water use efficiencies related to the amount of rainfall during the growing seasons were calculated for seeds and total above ground biomass. The soil deformation levels (main plots) comprised the following trials: non-compacted (NC, 0 tractor pass), moderately compacted (MC, 3 passes), and strongly compacted (SC, 5 passes). A uniform seedbed in all plots was prepared by harrowing before planting. The main plots included sub-plots without and with surface wheat straw mulch (0.5 kg m(-2)) and the corresponding trials were NC + M, MC + M, SC + M. The amount and distribution of rainfall during the growing season differed among the experimental years with extended drought at bloom-full seed (R2-R6) stages in 2006, good water supply in 2007, and alternative periods with relatively high and low rainfalls in 2008. The effect of soil deformation on matric potential was influenced by weather conditions, soybean growth phase, mulching and depth. The differences were greatest in 2007 and 2008 at R7-R8 growth stages. With increasing deformation level from NC to SC matric potential for 0-15 cm depth during these stages significantly decreased from -401 to -1184 kPa in 2007 and from -1154 to -1432 kPa in 2008. On mulched soil, the corresponding ranges were from -541 to -841 klpa and from -748 to -1386 kPa, respectively. In the dry summer 2006, the differences were smaller and less consistent. Irrespective of soil deformation level, mulching reduced soil temperature in most growth phases but most pronounced initially. Most yield components increased from NC to MC during the experiments which could be attributed to enhanced root water and nutrient uptake rates and decreased from MC to SC due to high soil strength that restrained root growth down to deeper depth. The yields of seeds, straw, protein and oil as well as water productivity of soybean seed and biomass were improved by mulching in 2007-2008. This improvement was more pronounced in 2007 when the mean yield of seeds, protein and oil were significantly greater by 16, 29 and 11%, respectively and was attributed to positive alterations in soil water retention. These results indicate the possibilities of improvement in soybean performance by identifying allowable amount of traffic and mulching practices at planting depending on weather fluctuations during the growing season. Since rainfall and air temperature distribution in 2007 are close to those averaged over a long period of time, the use of straw mulch may positively affect soybean performance and yields excluding anomalously dry years. The positive effect of straw mulch can be enhanced by moderate soil deformation combined with seedbed loosening before planting to avoid constraining effect of soil structure on crop establishment.

Here, we introduce an automated soil column system in which the water table regime is imposed using a computer-controlled, multi-channel pump connected to a hydrostatic equilibrium reservoir and a water storage reservoir. The potential of this new system is illustrated by comparing results from two columns filled with 45 cm of the same homogenized riparian soil. In one soil column the water table remained constant at -20 cm below the soil surface, while in the other the water table oscillated between the soil surface and the bottom of the column, at a rate of 4.8 cm d(-1). The experiment ran for 75 days at room temperature (25 +/- 2 degrees C). Micro-sensors installed at -10 and -30 cm below the soil surface in the stable water table column recorded constant redox potentials on the order of 600 and -200 mV, respectively. In the fluctuating water table column, redox potentials at the same depths oscillated between oxidizing (similar to 700 mV) and reducing (similar to-100 mV) conditions. Pore waters collected periodically and solid-phase analyses on core material obtained at the end of the experiment highlighted striking geochemical differences between the two columns, especially in the time series and depth distributions of Fe, Mn, K, P and S. Soil CO2 emissions derived from headspace gas analysis exhibited periodic variations in the fluctuating water table column, with peak values during water table drawdown. Transient redox conditions caused by the water table fluctuations enhanced microbial oxidation of soil organic matter, resulting in a pronounced depletion of particulate organic carbon in the midsection of the fluctuating water table column. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed the onset of differentiation of the bacterial communities in the upper (oxidizing) and lower (reducing) soil sections, although no systematic differences in microbial community structure between the stable and fluctuating water table columns were detected.

We propose a new methodology for estimating such parameters. We used an experimental set-up with 48 aquatic mesocosms, each with 20 first instar mosquito larvae and under 1 of 12 treatments with varying temperatures and nutrient concentrations. We took daily subsamples of the aquatic life stages as well as counting the emerging adults. We developed a method to estimate the survival and development probabilities at each life stage, based on optimising a matrix population model. We used two different approaches, one assuming the difference between predictions and observations was normally distributed, and the other using a combination of a normal and a multinomial distribution. For each approach, the resulting optimisation problem had around 100 parameters, making conventional gradient descent ineffective with our limited number of data points. We solved this by computing the formal derivatives of our matrix model. Both approaches proved effective in predicting mosquito populations over time, also when compared against a separate validation dataset, and the two approaches produced similar results. They also both predicted similar trends in the survival and development probabilities for each life stage, although there were some differences in the actual values. The approach which only used the normal distribution was considerably more computationally efficient than the mixed distribution approach. This is an effective approach for determining the survival and development rates of small animals in mesocosm experiments. We have not found any other reliable methodology for estimating these parameters, especially not from incomplete data or when there are many different experimental treatments. This methodology enables researchers to gain a much more detailed understanding of the life cycles of small animals, potentially leading to advances in a wide range of areas, for example in mosquito-borne disease risk or in considering the effects of biodiversity loss or climate change on different species.",,,,,,"Boerlijst, Sam/0000-0001-8957-186X; Dellar, Martha/0000-0003-1044-4265",,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,MAY,2022,13,5,,,,,1148,1160,,10.1111/2041-210X.13814,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13814,,FEB 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000762579600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Implications for climate change,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Global climate change is likely to have an important influence on the phenology, behaviour and population dynamics of many species. We investigate climatic related changes in the breeding phenology of Mediterranean loggerhead marine turtles Caretta caretta over a 19 year period and the potential relationship between these changes and reproductive success and performance. We found that the studied population has experienced fluctuating sea surface temperatures (SST) with an increasing trend during the last century. With increasing spring SST there is a trend towards earlier nesting. However, there is no significant relationship between SST and nesting season, defined as the duration between the first recorded emergence and the last nest laid. Our analyses indicate that marine turtles display phenological changes, and thus maintain favorable thermal conditions at the nesting sites. Furthermore, increasing spring SST was correlated with decreasing clutch size and increasing hatching success that resulted in an apparent lack of correlation between SST and hatchling production. This apparent independence might be misleading since it only holds for a limited range of SST values. Thus, if we estimate the effect of climate change on loggerhead population growth as neutral, based on the apparent independence between SST and total number of hatchlings, we will be underestimating the population extinction risk.

The goal of these programs was to study the interactions between the shelf edge environment and acoustic propagation at a wide range of frequencies and spatial scales. The low-frequency across-slope propagation was studied using a synthesis of data collected during both years including conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and mooring data from 2000, and XBT, thermistor chain, and wide-band source data front 2001. The water column variability during both years was dominated by the Kuroshio Current flowing from southwest to northeast over the continental slope. The barotropic tide was a mixed diurnal/semidiurnal tide with moderate amplitude compared to other parts of the Yellow and East China Sea. A large amplitude semidiurnal internal tide was also a prominent feature of the data during both years. Bursts of high-frequency internal waves were often observed, but these took the form of internal solitons only once, when a rapid off-shelf excursion of the Kuroshio coincided with the ebbing tide. Two case studies in the acoustic transmission loss (TL) over the continental shelf and slope were performed. First, anchor station data obtained during 2000 were used to study how a Kuroshio warm filament on the shelf induced variance in the transmission loss (TL) along the seafloor in the NW quadrant of the study region. The corresponding modeled single-frequency TL structure explained the significant fine-scale variability in time primarily by the changes in the multi path/multimode interference pattern. The interference was quite sensitive to small changes in the phase differences between individual paths/modes induced by the evolution of the warm filament. Second, the across-slope sound speed sections from 2001 were used to explain the observed phenomenon of abrupt signal attenuation as the transmission range lengthened seaward across the continental shelf and slope. This abrupt signal degradation was caused by the Kuroshio frontal gradients that produced an increasingly downward-refracting sound-speed field seaward from the shelf break. This abrupt signal dropout was explained using normal mode theory and was predictable and source depth dependent. For a source located above the turning depth of the highest-order shelf-trapped mode. none of the propagating modes on the shelf were excited, causing total signal extinction on the shelf.",,,,,"QI, Yiquan/H-2637-2012","QI, Yiquan/0000-0002-2255-187X; Miller, James H./0000-0001-7156-3589",,,,,,,,,,,,,0364-9059,1558-1691,,,,OCT,2004,29,4,,,,,1011,1031,,10.1109/JOE.2004.840842,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2004.840842,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000226732700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some results are reviewed and discussed in this paper. Predictions based on the steady-state energy balance indicated that to maintain an air temperature set point, a decrease in ventilation rate led to a decrease in required evapotranspiration, resulting in an increase in relative humidity. Experimental studies were carried out to demonstrate the predictions. Results for a fog-cooled greenhouse showed that the inside relative humidity decreased with an increase in ventilation rate as expected from the predictions, while the water use for fog cooling increased. However, it was of interest that the reduction of water use under low ventilation was mostly due to the reduction of plant transpiration because the transpiration rate decreased linearly with a decrease in vapor pressure deficit of the air. A simple control algorithm that incorporated the adjustment of vent openings and the control of fogging was proposed and tested. It demonstrated a possibility of maintaining relative humidity and air temperature simultaneously within a desirable range while reducing the water use. A study for pad-and-fan cooling showed similar but slightly different results. It demonstrated that there were no significant reductions in average air temperature or relative humidity above a level of ventilation rate, while the water use by the pad increased linearly with increasing ventilation rate. The daily water use by computer-controlled ventilation rate was less than the fixed ventilation rate control. Another challenge is to recover water from the greenhouse exhaust air, since a large amount of water for evaporative cooling and irrigation is exhausted through ventilation. The feasibility of using a condenser chilled by the pad sump water to recover water is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-581-0,,,,2008,,797,,,,,299,306,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2008.797.42,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2008.797.42,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000261541700042,View Full Record in Web of Science

I - The influence of variable radiation on boll loss, compensation and yield",FIELD CROPS RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Growth and reproductive structure development in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is dependent on light intensity, which is often irregular in tropical environments due to shading from cloudiness associated with the monsoon. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of cloudiness on reproductive organ abscission and how subsequent compensatory organ replacement, with the provision of irrigation, might recover yield in the semiarid monsoon tropics. Cotton cultivars representing different morphology were sown in field experiments at closely timed intervals during the early monsoon over five seasons to expose crops to varying amounts of cloud-related shading, creating a matrix of crop responses. A wide range for lint yield (1099 to 2900 kg ha(-1)) was symptomatic of the treatments' exposure to highly varied environmental conditions. Lint yield was moderately correlated (P < 0.01; Adj R-2 = 0.409) with monsoon cloudiness, reducing 235 kg ha(-1) per MJ m(-2) decrease in the average daily incident radiation during flowering. Final boll number rather than boll size was the key yield component (P < 0.001), with the number of bolls retained and their location within the canopy correlated with the solar radiation pattern spanning flowering. Boll number m(-2) decreased linearly in proportion to mean daily incident solar radiation, by 5.02 and 4.39 bolls MJ m(-2) during early (P = 0.007) and late flowering (P = 0.02) respectively. Cloudiness-induced boll loss from the early flowering canopy produced a negative correlation with late boll numbers, increasing by 7.2 bolls per MJ m(2) d(-1) decrease in mean incident radiation during early flowering (P < 0.001) as lower canopy boll loss enabled surplus assimilates for later set bolls. Fibre quality parameters were not negatively affected by reduced incident solar radiation during flowering and boll filling. The clustering of sowing times into groups according to similarities in the number and final distribution of bolls within the crop canopy provided a mechanism to identify sowing time treatments that shared similar compensation responses. The highest group yields occurred when minimal cloudiness during flowering allowed uninterrupted boll accumulation or alternatively when moderate boll losses from the lower canopy were compensated via additional later set bolls when radiation improved. Yield recovery was restricted for groups where cloudiness was ongoing or increased during late flowering or when canopy factors detracted from efficient use of available radiation. Extrapolation of the linear relationship between boll number and incident radiation showed boll retention was maximised at a mean daily value of 24.2 MJ m(-2) (R-max). Quantification of R-max was a key finding as it could be applied to calculate a cumulative radiation deficit (RD) = Sigma (if daily radiation is < R-max then daily RD = R-max-daily radiation) and provided an alternative independent variable for quantifying the impact of cloudiness during flowering on boll survival. Wider application of this concept requires research in larger solar radiation and temperature regimes than observed here. Yield compensation from cloud induced fruit abscission in the semi-arid tropics will be assisted by management that can extend flowering to create new fruiting sites whilst balancing the partitioning of canopy growth.",,,,,"Grundy, Paul/ABH-2619-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-4290,1872-6852,,,,SEP 1,2020,254,,,,,,,,107790,10.1016/j.fcr.2020.107790,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2020.107790,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000542185300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents recent research on the development of mathematical attic models and results from a sensitivity analysis of RBS performance parameters. Two levels of modelling capability have been developed. A very simplified model based on ASHRAE procedures is used to study the sensitivity of RBS performance parameters, and a very detailed finite-element model is used to study highly complex phenomena, including moisture adsorption and desorption in attics. The speed of the simple model allows a large range of attic parameters to be studied quickly, and the finite-element model provides a detailed understanding of combined heat and moisture transport in attics. This paper concentrates on the sensitivity analysis of attic RBS performance parameters using the simplified model. The development of the model is described, and results of the analyses are presented and discussed. Results from the finite-element model are also presented and compared with measurements from a test attic to illustrate the effects of moisture adsorption and desorption in common attics. The simplified steady-state model shows excellent agreement with measured steady-state data when thermal stratification of the attic air is modelled. Results of the sensitivity analysis using this model show that the radiant barrier surface emittance and the attic ventilation inlet air temperature are the most sensitive performance parameters for attic radiant barrier systems. The detailed, finite-element model shows that moisture sorption phenomena can have significant effects in attics. The daily temperature extremes in attics are significant, and they induce a moisture flux at the surfaces of the materials bounding the air zone(s). If this moisture flux is not accounted for in detail (i.e. with fully coupled heat and moisture transport equations) inaccurate surface temperature predictions are likely to occur.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0363-907X,,,,,JAN,1992,16,1,,,,,1,12,,10.1002/er.4440160102,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/er.4440160102,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992HA79300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Materials and Methods: A total of 26 healthy animals were equally used in the in the current study. The criterion for cows and buffaloes selection and the management conditions were similar. A total mixed ration to meet the animal's requirements was used, and dry matter intake (DMI) was calculated. Ambient temperature, relative humidity, temperature humidity index (THI), respiratory rate, and rectal temperature (RT) were daily recorded.

Results: The results confirmed, the HS condition, as the THI values ranged from 79.74 to 90.4 throughout the experimental period.

We monitored thermal regimes during the incubation period in 19 natural nests of scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) in montane southeastern Australia, and experimentally translocated eggs among nests to remove the confounding of ''nest of origin'' (including genetic) factors with incubation conditions. We removed the eggs from the field shortly before hatching, and assessed the hatchlings' phenotypes (body size, shape, locomotor performance). Most of the effects seen after laboratory incubation were also seen after incubation in natural nests. Hatchling phenotypes were affected by incubation conditions as well as by ''nest of origin'' factors and an interaction between the two. Both the mean and the variance of incubation temperatures affected hatchling phenotypes, with male and female hatchlings differing in their norms of reaction. We found no evidence that a female's choice of nest site depends on the specific norms of reaction of her own offspring. Overall, incubation temperatures induced approximately half as much variance in hatchling phenotypes as did ''nest-of-origin'' effects.

Colonies fed 5 ng/g (ppb) imidacloprid in sugar syrup showed increased brood production, lower temperature variability, higher CO2 production and had more foragers compared to control colonies fed unadulterated syrup, but treatment did not affect adult bee numbers or average hive temperatures, and did not increase food stores, daily food acquisition or colony survivorship. These results suggest that imidacloprid contamination increased colony metabolism without improving colony productivity, and helps explain why some studies have reported no, or even positive, effects of neonicotinoids.

The experiments were conducted in a recirculation system at a water temperature of 27 +/- 1 degreesC in glass aquaria for 16 weeks. Tilapia growth did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) with up to 50% substitution of FM with CSM. Fish meal replacement above 50% resulted in significant growth decline with time. Fish fed with 100% FM and diets including 50% CSM had significantly better daily weight gain, daily feed intake and feed efficiency ratio than those fed with 100% CSM. Fish fed with 75% CSM and above had lower concentrations of body iron, calcium and phosphorus than controls (100% FM). Concentrations of total gossypol in diets (ranging from 0.11 to 0.44% in diets 2-5) resulted in proportional increase of total gossypol in fish liver (32.3, 72.3, 99.4 and 132.1 mug g(-1) wet weight) in groups fed with diet 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. We concluded that CSM can partially replace FM as a main source of protein in feed for tilapia at not more than 50%. The presence of gossypol in CSM was identified as the major limiting factor for acceptance and utilization of CSM-based diets in tilapia farming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1353-5773,1365-2095,,,,SEP,2001,7,3,,,,,189,200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000170794800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Growers who can meet this demand have a competitive edge in the direct-to-consumer market. Innovations in strawberry production for northern climates offer new opportunities for growers to meet the demand for local organic strawberries. Typically adopted for season extension, the use of polycovered tunnels for crop protection provides other benefits including protection from adverse weather. Low tunnels are easy to install, low cost, temporary protective structures that are well-adapted for annual day-neutral strawberry production, and they are more space efficient than high tunnels for these low-stature crops. A range of specialty tunnel plastics that modify and diffuse light are available, but there is little information on how these influence strawberry plant growth and performance in the field. Our objectives were to determine the effects of experimental ultraviolet blocking and transmitting plastics on light and microclimate in low tunnel environments and assess differences in fruit yield and quality in the day-neutral strawberry cultivar Albion in an organic production system. This research was conducted on U.S. Department of Agriculture-certified organic land over 2 years, in 2016 and 2017. We found that ultraviolet intensity and daily light integral (DLI) were lower in covered plots than in the open field. Maximum daily temperatures were slightly higher in covered plots. Both ultraviolet-blocking and ultraviolet-transmitting plastics improved marketable fruit yield compared with the open-field control. Strawberries grown in the open-field treatment were lower in chroma than covered plots in 2017, and there was no difference in total soluble solids between treatments in either year. Low tunnel systems allow for increased environmental control and improved fruit quality and are well-adapted for day-neutral organic strawberry production systems.",,,,,,"Rogers, Mary/0000-0001-6609-3113",,,,,,,,,,,,,1063-0198,1943-7714,,,,OCT,2019,29,5,,,,,590,598,,10.21273/HORTTECH04319-19,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH04319-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000489115500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we tested the use of a thermal infrared derived empirical crop water stress index (CWSIe) as an in situ measurement of the water status of sugarcane, to better monitor the irrigation scheduling. To do this, we set up a 2-year experiment in Reunion Island, on a trial with plots under different water conditions (rainfed and irrigated). Crop surface temperature was measured daily with infrared radiometers (Apogee Instruments) installed above the canopy, and soil moisture and drainage measurements were used to derive the ratio between actual and maximum evapotranspiration (AET/MET) values that were then averaged on hydrically homogeneous time periods (between 7 and 25 days). Only the thermal data acquired on clear days and 1 h after noon in 2007 were used to define the empirical lower and upper baselines required for the calculation of empirical CWSI The data set acquired in 2008 was used to test the robustness of the method as we used the upper and lower baselines defined in 2007 to calculate CWSIe. The linear regression between AET/MET and (1 - CWSIe) averaged on the same periods (values ranging between 0.4 and 1) showed a significant correlation for both experimental years (global R-2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 0.12). This result indicates the effectiveness of the CWSIe to measure the water status of the sugarcane crop, even in humid conditions with a vapor pressure deficit (VPD) between 0.5 and 2.1. We conclude the study by discussing the complementarity of this remote water stress index (CWSIe) with OSIRI water balance modelling tool currently used in Reunion Island for monitoring sugarcane crop irrigation.

The use of different methods complicates comparison between studies and here we present a mathematical model (and R-scripts) to reconcile thermal tolerance measures obtained from static and dynamic assays. Our model uses input data from several static or dynamic experiments and is based on the well-supported assumption that thermal injury accumulation rate increases exponentially with temperature (known as a thermal death time curve). The model also assumes thermal stress at different temperatures to be additive and using experiments with Drosophila melanogaster, we validate these central assumptions by demonstrating that heat injury attained at different heat stress intensities and durations is additive. In a separate experiment we demonstrate that our model can accurately describe injury accumulation during fluctuating temperature stress and further we validate the model by successfully converting literature data of ectotherm heat tolerance (both static and dynamic assays) to a single, comparable metric (the temperature tolerated for 1 h). The model presented here has many promising applications for the analysis of ectotherm thermal tolerance and we also discuss potential pitfalls that should be considered and avoided using this model.",,,,,"Overgaard, Johannes/I-7493-2013; Jørgensen, Lisa/ABC-2029-2021; Overgaard, Johannes/AAA-3922-2022","Overgaard, Johannes/0000-0002-2851-4551; Jørgensen, Lisa/0000-0002-4438-4558; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,JUN 18,2021,11,1,,,,,,,12840,10.1038/s41598-021-92004-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92004-6,,,,,,,,34145337,,,,,WOS:000665058900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on greenhouse experiments, crop models and biotechnological tools, this paper will discuss the physiology of plant-greenhouse interactions. It is discussed how these interactions can be applied to control the production process at Northern and Mediterranean climatic conditions. Absorption of light by the leaves is important for maximum crop photosynthesis. For this, it is important to have plants that develop as fast as possible a sufficient leaf area index. The question is: what leaf area index is needed for optimal crop performance? Most of the light is absorbed by the upper part of the canopy. Can we improve the light distribution in the canopy and, moreover, does this increases yield or quality? Virtual plant models may help to address this question. In some cases removal of older leaves can improve yield, while in other cases removal of young leaves may accomplish the same objective. In summer time the light transmission of the greenhouse is often reduced by growers to avoid plant stress. However, in several cases this stress is only an indirect effect of light, because other growth factors (e. g. temperature, humidity) tend to be suboptimal. In Northern countries CO2 supply is commonly used. The introduction of semi-closed greenhouses allows to maintain high CO2 concentrations all year round. In Mediterranean countries, a large yield increase is still feasible by CO2 supply. Optimum growth conditions means that there is a good balance among different climate conditions. The source/sink ratio of a crop (ratio between production and demand of assimilates) often reflects whether these conditions are balanced. Variation in the source/sink balance affects formation and abortion of organs, product quality and production fluctuations. Some examples are shown on temperature control based on the source/sink balance of a crop. Drought and salinity may limit production especially in the Mediterranean. Morphological and metabolic traits, with known genetic bases, can be functionally altered to test current hypotheses on plant-environment interactions and eventually design a greenhouse plant. Reasonably, such a plant should have specific shoot vs. root developmental patterns, efficient water and nutrient uptake systems as well as other specific features that have not been sufficiently explored. Elucidation of the complex plant-greenhouse interactions would establish a physiological basis to improve both product quality and resource use efficiency in greenhouse.",,,,,"Leo, Marcelis/ABG-8762-2021","Marcelis, Leo/0000-0002-8088-7232",,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,2406-6168,978-90-6605-731-9,,,,2009,807,,,,,,163,173,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.807.20,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2009.807.20,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000305334500020,View Full Record in Web of Science

V.",,,Soil evolution in relation to modern climate warming,THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"In connection with warming, the current state of the climate relative to the climate normal is analyzed. In quantitative terms, the climate normal is a parameter of any characteristic of climate of atmosphere or soil sampled from 1961 to 1990 in a daily, ten-day, monthly, seasonal, or annual cycle. Currently, climatic changes occur on global, continental and regional level. On the global level, especially strong climate warming has been observed over the past 100 years: the average ten-year air temperature increased, as compared with its lowest (1891-1900), by 1.2-1.3 degrees C by now. Modern warming has affected all continents, while the air temperature on the continents has increased, as compared with the climate normal, by 0.3-1.5 degrees C. Analysis of climate change on the regional level was carried out during the period of experimental observations (1921-2015) by the example of soils in the zonal range of the European part of Russia: peat gleyzems of forest-tundra, podzolic soils of middle taiga, sod-podzolic soils of southern taiga, and light-chestnut soils of dry steppe. It is established that each soil is characterized by a certain normal of climatic parameters. For zonal series of soils under research it was shown that the current climate warming is accompanied by the increase in air and soil temperature and, consequently, by displacement of soil-climatic zones in the north. The current climate warming, according to the temperature parameter, has become commensurate with the climatic optimum of the Holocene. Favorable conditions are created for promotion of forest communities to the north, which may lead to development of a podzolic type of soil formation in forest-occupied tundra territories. For forest soils of the northern and middle taiga, under conditions of the current climate warming, soil formation will be accompanied by weakening podzolic soil and intensification of sod soil-forming processes. One can also expect increase in aridization and salinization of chestnut soils of dry steppes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1995-4301,2618-8406,,,,,2017,,2,,,,,38,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000468547000007,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Lovegrove, BG",,,,"Lovegrove, Barry Gordon",,,The evolution of endothermy in Cenozoic mammals: a plesiomorphic-apomorphic continuum,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The evolution of endothermy in birds and mammals was one of the most important events in the evolution of the vertebrates. Past tests of hypotheses on the evolution of endothermy in mammals have relied largely on analyses of the relationship between basal and maximum metabolic rate, and artificial selection experiments. I argue that components of existing hypotheses, as well as new hypotheses, can be tested using an alternative macrophysiological modeling approach by examining the development of endothermy during the Cenozoic. Recent mammals display a 10 degrees C range in body temperature which is sufficiently large to identify the selective forces that have driven the development of endothermy from a plesiomorphic (ancestral) Cretaceous or Jurassic condition. A model is presented (the Plesiomorphic-Apomorphic Endothermy Model, PAE Model) which proposes that heterothermy, i.e. bouts of normothermy (constant body temperature) interspersed with adaptive heterothermy (e.g. daily torpor and/or hibernation), was the ancestral condition from which apomorphic (derived), rigid homeothermy evolved. All terrestrial mammal lineages are examined for existing data to test the model, as well as for missing data that could be used to test the model. With the exception of Scandentia and Dermoptera, about which little is known, all mammalian orders that include small-sized mammals (<500 g), have species which are heterothermic and display characteristics of endothermy which fall somewhere along a plesiomorphic-apomorphic continuum. Orders which do not have heterothermic representatives ( Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Pholidota, and Lagomorpha) are comprised of medium-to large-sized mammals that have either lost the capacity for heterothermy, or in which heterothermy has yet to be measured. Mammalian heterothermy seems to be plesiomorphic and probably evolved once in the mammalian lineage. Several categories of endothermy are identified ( protoendothermy, plesioendothermy, apoendothermy, basoendothermy, mesoendothermy, supraendothermy, and reversed mesoendothermy) to describe the evolution of endothermy during the Cenozoic. The PAE Model should facilitate the testing of hypotheses using a range of macrophysiological methods ( e. g. the comparative method and the reconstruction of ancestral states).",,,,,"Lovegrove, Barry G/D-1320-2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1464-7931,1469-185X,,,,FEB,2012,87,1,,,,,128,162,,10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00188.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00188.x,,,,,,,,21682837,,,,,WOS:000298732300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two methods are used to provide the climate change scenarios. First, a range of arbitrary changes in temperature and precipitation are applied to the calibrated rainfall-runoff model to study the sensitivity of runoff and soil moisture to potential changes in the climate. Second, results from five global climate model (GCM) enhanced greenhouse experiments are analysed to provide regional climate change scenarios to estimate the range of plausible changes in runoff and soil moisture by the years 2030 and 2070. The sensitivity analyses indicate that changes in rainfall are always amplified in runoff with the amplification factor for runoff being higher in drier catchments. The change in rainfall has little effect on the soil moisture in wet catchments but in drier catchments, the percentage change in soil moisture levels can be greater than the percentage change in rainfall. Compared to precipitation, temperature increases alone have negligible impacts on the runoff and soil moisture. The simulations using the GCM scenarios indicate increases in annual runoff of up to 25% by the year 2030 in the wet tropical catchments near the north-east coast of Australia. The GCMs do not agree in the direction of rainfall change in south-east Australia, and the simulations show runoff changes of up to +/-20% by 2030. For Tasmanian catchments, up to 10% increase in runoff is simulated whereas for catchments in the South Australian Gulf, up to 35% decrease in annual runoff is simulated for 2030. Near the western coast of Australia, the simulations show runoff changes of up to +/-50%. These results show the potential for climate change to bring about runoff modifications that may require a significant planning response.

Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum dominated esocid diets (77-97% by weight) through autumn but were absent by spring. Diets in late autumn and spring included sunfishes Lepomis spp. and brook silversides Labidesthes sicculus. Northern pike and tiger muskellunge grew faster than muskellunge through the first year. Food consumption was highest for tiger muskellunge, followed by northern pike, then muskellunge. Growth rates and rations were highest immediately after stocking, declining through autumn to their lowest levels in December and spring. A bioenergetic model underestimated final mass by a factor of two to three for all esocids; predictions for food consumption were better than those for growth but still overestimated observed values by 39-52%. Neither behavioral thermoregulation nor incorporation of seasonal energetic content of prey altered predictions (maximum of 2% increase). In contrast, adjustments in metabolic rates to account for differences in season and temperature substantially improved model predictions. Size-selective mortality did not account for the inaccuracies in model predictions. Conversion efficiencies (39-63%) exceeded those previously measured for esocids fed maximum rations, suggesting that model variables should be determined for a range of ration levels.

The study aimed to determine the effect of each system on the energy consumption and resulting greenhouse microclimate. The experiments were conducted in a commercial size greenhouse in which pepper was grown. To check the performance of the fan that was controlled by a VFD system, it was installed in a test facility and operated under several rotation speeds. At each speed of rotation, the static pressure on the fan was changed and parameters, such as electricity consumption and air flow rate, were measured. Reducing the fan speed with the VFD system resulted in reductions in the air flow rate through the greenhouse and energy consumption, the latter being much more significant. The study showed that VFD control can reduce electricity consumption compared with ON-OFF operation by an amount that depends on the weather. In the present study, the average energy consumption with the VFD control system over a period of one month, was about 0.64 of that with an ON-OFF system. The average greenhouse daily air temperatures and humidity ratios obtained with each control system between 0700 and 1800 were nearly equal during that month. The results obtained in the greenhouse further show that the VFD system has a greater potential than the ON-OFF to reduce the range of amplitude variations in the air temperature and humidity ratio within the greenhouse.

Lipid production in clone ELLIP1 was strongly influenced by growth irradiance, with substantial production of triacylglycerols under higher light.

Eighteen bulls were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups: (1) CTL, basal diet without fat supplementation; (2) FS100, basal diet with 100 g fat supplementation (Energizer-RP-10 (R), IFFCO, Johor, Malaysia); (3) FS200, basal diet with 200 g fat supplementation. Basal diet consisted of 50% green fodder (corn silage), 25% wheat straw, and 25% concentrate on dry matter basis. Diets were offered for 14 weeks from May to August 2016. The average daily temperature-humidity index ranged from 85 to 88 for the experimental period. The results indicated that there was no difference in dry matter intake, water intake, rectal temperature, pulse rate, and respiration rate among the treatment groups. Fat supplementation did not influence semen traits including sperm motility, progressive motility, amplitude of lateral head displacement, live-to-dead ratio, normal acrosomal ridge, plasma membrane integrity, and DNA integrity. The interaction of season with fat revealed that FA200 significantly increased post thaw semen motility and progressive motility during hot humid summer (P<0.05). Analysis of blood metabolites showed that blood urea nitrogen was higher in FS200 compared with CTL and FS100 groups (P<0.05). There was no effect of fat supplementation on blood testosterone level.

Their effects on soil hydrology, however, are poorly understood. It has been speculated that crusts ( 1) improve soil water availability by sealing the soil surface to water loss, or ( 2) diminish soil water by increasing the latent heat of a soil pro le thereby increasing evaporation. In order to distinguish between these two opposing hypotheses, we analyzed water loss and temperature of soil profiles covered by different types of microbiotic soil crust ( cyanobacteria, Psora decipiens, Placidium squamulosum) and a bare soil. We conducted experiments under growth chamber and field conditions. After watering to field capacity, surfaces (1-3 cm deep) of crusted soils took as long or longer to decrease to -1.5 MPa water potential as bare soil in both the growth chamber and the field. In the growth chamber, soils covered by each of the crust types took longer to dry than bare soil. In the field, soils covered by cyanobacteria took longer to dry than bare soils or those covered by the other crusts. Daily soil temperature was not different among the different crust types and bare soil in either experiment. This study did not support the hypothesis that crusts dry a soil pro le more quickly by increasing the amount of energy available for evaporation. Rather our data suggested that crusts increase soil water availability by increasing water flux resistance, specifically at the soil surface.",,,,,"Johansen, Jeffrey R/F-5616-2011","Johansen, Jeffrey R/0000-0002-0794-9417",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-4982,1532-4990,,,,APR-JUN,2003,17,2,,,,,113,125,,10.1080/15324980301588,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324980301588,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000180967100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is unclear how well these models represent the response of lakes to changes in climate and hydrologic conditions. To address this question, we conducted a series of climate and hydrologic sensitivity analyses using a parameterized water quality model, CE-QUAL-W2, for the Spokane River and Lake Spokane system. Two experimental tests with climate and flow forcing showed that the model predictions were rather insensitive to climatic-driven hydrologic changes and a wide range of hydrologic conditions (1st to 99th percentile flows) for two different wastewater treatment plant discharge scenarios. The model realistically represented some aspects of Lake Spokane's observed responses to climatic and hydrologic variability, for example, the water residence time and some water quality trends. However, the model overestimated the reservoir total phosphorus (TPR) concentration by similar to 37% and the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration by similar to 31% and underestimated the minimum volume-weighted hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DOMIN) concentration by similar to 26% for a wide range of flows compared to the observed data. In contrast to the model's water quality insensitivity, the modeled temperature was more sensitive to flow than was actually observed in Lake Spokane. This study provides guidance for improving the response of one of the most important mechanistic water quality models to climatic and hydrologic forcing and should help modelers and decision-makers to develop a rigorous assessment of climate and flow sensitivity to improve the margin of safety when setting total maximum daily load targets.",,,,,"; Zhang, Chen/G-9555-2016","Brett, Michael/0000-0001-5065-2144; Zhang, Chen/0000-0003-3212-4270",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,SEP,2018,54,9,,,,,6609,6624,,10.1029/2018WR022580,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR022580,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000448088100043,View Full Record in Web of Science

A range of weight-specific growth rates (G(W)) was obtained in experiments with individual sticklebacks fed enchtraeid worms at different daily rations over 21 days. There was a strong, positive correlation between G (W) and the RNA : DNA ratio in white muscle (r(2) = 0.90) and lipid concentration (as percentage dry weight) of the carcass (r(2) = 0.92). There were smaller, but significant correlations between G (W) and the percentage of dry matter in the carcass (r(2) = 0.67), and the residuals from the weight-length relationship (r(2) = 0.49). Regressions relating growth to RNA : DNA ratio and lipid concentration offer a means of estimating short-term growth rates in natural populations.

Conversely, in Palau's low pH lagoons, coral cover is high, coral communities are diverse, and calcification rates of two reef-building corals exhibit no apparent sensitivity to the strong natural gradient in pH and aragonite saturation state (Omega(ar)). We developed two methods to quantify rates of Net Ecosystem Calcification (NEC), the ecosystem-level balance between calcification and dissolution, in Risong Lagoon, where average daily pH is similar to 7.9 and Omega(ar) similar to 2.7. While coral cover in the lagoon is within the range of other Pacific reefs (similar to 26%), NEC rates were among the lowest measured, averaging 25.9 +/- 13.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1) over two 4 d study periods. NEC rates were highly variable, ranging from a low of 13.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in March 2012 to a high of 40.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in November 2013, despite no significant changes in temperature, salinity, inorganic nutrients, Omega(ar), or pH. Our results indicate that the coral reef community of Risong Lagoon produces just enough calcium carbonate to maintain net positive calcification but comes dangerously close to net zero or negative NEC (net dissolution). Identifying the factors responsible for low NEC rates as well as the drivers of NEC variability in naturally low pH reef systems are key to predicting their futures under 21 st century climate change.",,,,,"Shamberger, Kathryn E F/C-9531-2014","Shamberger, Kathryn E F/0000-0002-2927-3657",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,MAR,2018,63,2,,,,,714,730,,10.1002/lno.10662,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10662,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000427104700015,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the first experiment slaughter pigs (n = 71) from two different crossings, were raised at a density of 0.7 m(2)/animal, (10 pigs/pen) either with (enriched) or without (conventional) a bedding of daily fresh straw. In the second experiment, animals (n=60) were reared under either conventional or free range housing (1.25 m(2)/animal, 30 pigs per pen) conditions. Main differences between conventional and enriched housed pigs were found in the biceps femoris (BF) muscle, and related to temperature, drip loss and colour. Association studies revealed that there were significant correlations between early (0-4 h) post mortem muscle pH and glycogen and lactate concentrations and between muscle pH measured at 1 h post mortem and muscle rigidity, expressed as the rigor value. There were significant differences with respect to meat quality and post mortem metabolism of the longissimus lumborum (LL), between conventional and free-range pigs. Early postmortem pH (0-4 h) was highest in the free-range pigs, due to low lactate concentrations. The relatively fast pH decline in the conventionally housed group resulted in increased amounts of water exuding from the meat, as measured by the filter paper method. The ultimate pH, was lowest in the free-range animals. The differences in ultimate pH, however, had no effect on drip or cooking losses. It can be concluded from these results that enrichment of the housing system has little effect on the course of the post mortem metabolism and meat quality. However, increasing the freedom of movement by applying lower stocking densities, affects the post mortem muscle metabolism, resulting in reduced water exudation. Correlations up to 0.7 between energetic parameters are not sufficiently high to be useful to predict meat quality of individual carcasses. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Prasinophyceae and Synechococcus contribution became substantial in winter (Prasinophyceae = 30% Tchl a) and summer (Synechococcus = 35% Tchl a). Phytoplankton growth and grazing mortality rates for major groups were estimated by dilution experiments in combination with high pressure liquid chromatography and flow cytometry carried out monthly over two years. Growth rates of total phytoplankton (range = 0.30-1.91 d(-1)) were significantly higher in spring and summer (mu > 1.3 d(-1)) than in autumn and winter (mu similar to 0.65 d(-1)) and showed a weak dependence on temperature but a significant positive correlation with day length. Microzooplankton grazing (range = 0.03-1.4 d(-1)) was closely coupled to phytoplankton growth. Grazing represented the main process for loss of phytoplankton, removing 60 +/- 34% (+/-SD) of daily primary production and 70 +/- 48% of Tchl a stock. Chla synthesis was highest during the Bacillarophyceae-dominated spring bloom (Chl a(synt) = 2.3 +/- 1.6 mu g Chl a L-1 d(-1)) and lowest during the following post-bloom conditions dominated by Prymnesiophyceae (Chl a(synt) = 0.23 +/- 0.08 mu g Chl a L-1 d(-1)).

The purpose of this study is to determine annual Soil CO2 flux and assess its variations in arable subtropical soils of China in relation to soil temperature, moisture, rainfall, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) using the closed chamber method. Soils were derived from three parent materials including granite (G), tertiary red sandstone (T) and quaternary red clay (Q). The experiment was conducted at the Ecological Station of Red Soil, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, in a subtropical region of China. The results showed that Soil CO2 flux had clear seasonal fluctuations with the maximum value in summer, the minimum in winter and intermediate in spring and autumn. Further, significant differences in Soil CO2 flux were found among the three red soils, generally in the order of G>T>Q.

Experimental cheeses were manufactured from whole milk inoculated with a suspension of B. anthracis vegetative cells and spores at a final concentration of 10(4) cfu/ml. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and lab ferment were used to induce milk ripening and milk coagulation. The pH-value of the contaminated milk dropped below 4.5 within the first 6 h and the amount of LAB increased by approximately 2-logs. During cheese production and storage at 5-9 degrees C for 24 days no growth of B. anthracis was observed. The amount of vegetative cells and spores fluctuated by 1-log. Inoculation of whole milk with heat-treated spores at 10(4) cfu/ml resulted in a slight increase of vegetative cell counts during the first 6 h. This indicated that germination occurred, but replication of vegetative cells was still inhibited in the produced cheese. Incubation of cheeses at room temperature or heating after milk coagulation strongly reduced the amount of LAB but had no effect on the growth behaviour of B. anthracis. The vegetative cell and spore content remained steady at 10(4) cfu/100 mg. During yoghurt production the pH-value decreased within 5 h below 5 and growth of B. anthracis was inhibited throughout storage.

In summer 2006, we monitored mortality by strict daily verification of three full-sib families of oysters reared under common conditions. We quantified OsHV-1 using real-time PCR in dead and living individuals during and after a mortality event. Mortality events were severe and brief, but significantly different between tested families (cumulative mortality ranging from 1.2 to 49%). Real-time PCR assays revealed different viral DNA loads in dead individuals from different families (P < 0.001). Moreover, the mean level of infection among families was correlated with mortality (P < 0.05). Living oysters showed a significantly lower amount of viral DNA compared with dead ones. This is the first experiment showing the daily changes of individual OsHV-1 DNA load during a mortality outbreak. Our results also support the previously reported high genetic basis underlying the variance of resistance of Pacific oyster to summer mortality, suggesting that there might be a possibility to improve resistance to OsHV-1 by selective breeding.

Knowledge of crop growth parameters is crucial for the introduction of a new crop, and the use of a crop model can help to understand yield formation and yield limiting processes. The aim of the study was to parameterise and validate the model LINTUL for grain amaranth. Basically, LINTUL estimates dry matter production from daily intercepted radiation and light use efficiency under potential growth conditions, i.e. without occurrence of any other limiting factors. A field experiment with the A. hypochondriacus genotypes Neuer Typ and Anderer Typ was carried out under semiarid conditions in 2004 and 2005. Field data of individual years were used for parameterisation while independent observations of the other year allowed for cross-validation, respectively. The estimated light use efficiency ranged between 2.5 and 2.8g MJ(-1) (total biomass per accumulated PAR). Specific leaf area estimates were lower in observations of 2004 (0.014 m(2) g(-1)) than in observations of 2005 (0.018 in m(2) g(-1)) The light extinction coefficient of both genotypes measured before heading was 1.1. The effective sum of temperature (above a given threshold of 8 degrees C) to anthesis was 554 degrees C d for the genotype Neuer Typ and 640 degrees C d for Anderer Typ in both years. The effective sum of temperature to maturity was 1127 degrees Cd in 2004, and 1249 degrees Cd in 2005 independent of the genotype. Model predictions of total biomass agreed well (RMSE: 92 to 136 g m(-2)) with the observed biomass throughout the growing cycle including final harvest (between 749 and 1172 g m(-2)). The estimated grain yield over time (RMSE: 47 to 112 g m(-2)) matched the field observations including final grain yield (between 220 and 367 g m(-2)) with less accuracy. The leaf area index was overestimated throughout the growing cycle from heading onwards to seed filling. The sharp initial increase in grain yield was underestimated suggesting that currently produced assimilates could not meet the growth capacity of the young seeds but might be complemented by internal re-translocation of biomass.",,,,,"Kaul, Hans-Peter/AAH-3701-2019","Kaul, Hans-Peter/0000-0001-9545-1944",,,,,,,,,,,,,1439-040X,,,,,APR,2009,82,2,,,,,183,192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000266332600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used baited pitfall traps to define the range of the Gothenburg, Nebraska population of N. americanus. Using mark-recapture techniques, we estimate that the annual Gothenburg population consists of more than one thousand individuals, meeting the recovery plan criterion to become the third breeding population in the Midwest region. Beyond estimates of population size and range, we present novel data on seasonal and daily activity, sex ratio, age-grading and foraging distances. In 1995 and 1996, the Nebraska population was univoltine and female biased, with over-wintering mature beetles emerging in early June and teneral beetles emerging in August. Nocturnal activity was highest in the third and fourth hours following sunset but was not strongly correlated with temperature. During foraging, beetles travel up to six kilometers, but the majority of our recaptures occurred at distances of less than 0.5 km, suggesting that distances between traps be increased to ensure independence of sampling units.

The OTCs enhanced daily mean air temperature by 2.9 K throughout the growing season. Conversely, soil moisture within the OTCs on average declined by 3% over the experimental period. Experimental warming did not affect the timing of bud break, although treeline birch saplings growing in the OTCs manifested later leaf abscission, resulting in longer leaf life span. Artificial warming significantly accelerated the leaf and shoot growth rates of treeline birch saplings, resulting in larger leaf area and longer shoot elongation late in the growing season. Moreover, experimental warming significantly reduced the leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and tended to increase specific leaf area (SLA). Moreover, elevated temperatures significantly enhanced the transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (g (s)), maximum net assimilation rate (A (max)), dark respiration rate (R (d)) and apparent quantum yield (AQY) but did not influence the light compensation point (LCP) and light saturation point (LSP) of treeline birch saplings.

We analyzed over 2-years of continuous measurements of soil CO2 efflux (Fs) under vegetation (Fs(veg)) and at bare soil (Fs(bare)) in a water-limited grassland. The continuous wavelet transform was used to: (a) describe the temporal variability of Fs; (b) test the performance of empirical models ranging in complexity; and (c) identify hot-moments of Fs. We used partial wavelet coherence (PWC) analysis to test the temporal correlation between Fs with temperature and soil moisture. The PWC analysis provided evidence that soil moisture overshadows the influence of soil temperature for Fs in this water limited ecosystem. Precipitation pulses triggered hot-moments that increased Fs(veg) (up to 9000%) and Fs(bare) (up to 17,000%) with respect to pre-pulse rates. Highly parameterized empirical models (using support vector machine (SVM) or an 8-day moving window) are good approaches for representing the daily temporal variability of Fs, but SVM is a promising approach to represent high temporal variability of Fs (i.e., hourly estimates).

Numerous new species are being described but generally, Little information is provided on their ecology. Moreover, many species have been described previously without subsequent ecological information. This paper presents a number of simple experiments examining a nematode's physiological host range, host-foraging behavior, thermal activity range, and soil moisture activity range that provides the basic information necessary for further studies of a new species as a biological control agent. We suggest that any taxonomic description of new species should be combined with such an ecological study. This kind of information should also be generated for species in which no ecological studies have been done. In our study, we found that the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema rarum which was described in 1986 infected a wide range of arthropod species under laboratory conditions but appeared to be best adapted to lepidopteran larvae as hosts. It used an intermediate foraging strategy infecting both mobile hosts on the soil surface and sedentary hosts below the soil surface efficiently. The range of soil moisture at which S. rarum was effective suggested an adaptation to the fluctuating soil moisture in the upper soil layers. Its temperature optimum of 25 degrees C corresponded well to the warm temperate climate of its area of origin in Argentina. The optimal storage temperature was around 15 degrees C. Our study suggests that S. rarum is well adapted to lepidopteran hosts with larvae spending part of their live on the soil surface and/or that pupate in the soil.

Larvae were known to be weakly freeze tolerant in summer with a mean supercooling point (SCP) around -4 degreesC and a lower lethal temperature of -10 degreesC (15 min exposure). This study investigated the effects of successive freezing exposures on the SCP and subsequent survival of summer acclimatised larvae. The mean SCP of field fresh larvae was -4.2 +/- 0.2 degreesC with a range from -1.0 to -6.1 degreesC. When larvae were cooled to -6.5 degreesC on 10 occasions at intervals of 30 min and one and four days, survival was 44, 70 and 68%, respectively. The 'end of experiment' SCP of larvae surviving 10 exposures at -6.5 degreesC showed distinct changes and patterns from the original field population depending on the interval between exposure. In the 30 min interval group, most larvae froze between -6 and -8 degreesC, a depression of up to 6 degreesC from the original sample; all larvae were dead when cooling was continued below the SCP to -12 degreesC. In the one and four day interval groups, most larvae froze above -6 degreesC, showing no change as a result of the 10 exposures at -6.5 degreesC. As with the 30 min interval group, some larvae froze below -6 degreesC, but with a wider range, and again, all were dead when cooled to -12 degreesC. However, in the one and four day interval groups, some larvae remained unfrozen when cooled to -12 degreesC, a depression of their individual SCP of at least 6 degreesC, and were alive 24 h after cooling. In a further experiment, larvae were cooled to their individual SCP temperature at daily intervals on 10 occasions to ensure that every larva froze every day. Most larvae which showed a depression of their SCP of 2-4 degreesC from their day one value became moribund or died after six or seven freezing events. Survival was highest in larvae with SCPs of -2 to -3 degreesC on day one and which froze at this level on all 10 occasions. The results indicate that in larvae in which the SCP is lowered following sub-zero exposure, the depression of the SCP is greatest in individuals that do not actually freeze. Further, the data suggest that after successive frost exposures in early winter the larval population may become segregated into two sub-populations with different overwintering strategies. One group consists of larvae that freeze consistently in the temperature range from -1 to -3 degreesC and can survive multiple freeze-thaw cycles. A second group with lower initial SCPs (around -6 degreesC), or which fall to this level or lower (down to -12 degreesC) after freezing on one or more occasions, are less likely to freeze through extended supercooling, but more likely to die if freezing occurs.

Low salinity conditions from 2 to 10 g/L provided optimal conditions with high survival and good growth performance, while 0 g/L and salinities > 14 g/L gave poorer survival rates (p < 0.05). Salinity levels from freshwater to 10 g/L did not have any negative effects on fish weight gain, daily weight gain, or specific growth rate.

Cortisol levels were elevated in the 14 and 18 g/L treatments after 6 h and reached a peak after 24-h exposure, and this also led to increases in plasma glucose concentration. After 14 days, surviving fish in all treatments appeared to have acclimated to their respective conditions with cortisol levels remaining under 5 ng/mL with glucose concentrations stable. Tra catfish do not appear to be efficient osmoregulators when salinity levels exceed 10 g/L, and at raised salinity levels, growth performance is compromised.

From laboratory experiments, we estimated oxygen consumption of the mesozooplankton community obtained in Bay of Mejillones, northern Chile (23 degrees S) in May 2010, December 2010 and August 2011. Mass-specific respiration rates were in the range of 8.2-24.5 mu mol O-2 mg dry mass(-1) day(-1), at an average temperature of 12 degrees C. Estimates of the mesozooplankton biomass in the water column indicated that its aerobic respiration may remove daily a maximum of about 20% of oxygen available at the base of the oxycline. Since previous work indicates that zooplankton aggregate near the base of the oxycline, the impact of aerobic respiration on oxygen content might be even stronger at this depth. Mesozooplankton respiration, along with community respiration by microorganisms near the base of the oxycline and a strongly stratified condition (limiting vertical flux of O-2), are suggested as being critical factors causing and maintaining a persistent subsurface oxygen-deficient ecological barrier (BEDOX) in the upwelling zone. This BEDOX layer can have a major role in affecting and regulating zooplankton distribution and their dynamics in the highly productive coastal upwelling zone of the Humboldt Current System.

This review presents the results of experiments conducted in a commercial scale production environment (0.5-1.6 m(3) flow-through tanks) and focuses on the most relevant factors influencing growth and production in intensive rearing systems. Combined effects of food ration and temperature showed that the maximum growth rates (0.06-1.80 g fish(-1) day(-1) for 1-300 g fish) were observed at 23 degrees C. The thermal range for intensive rearing of perch extends at least down to 11 degrees C (growth rate equivalent to 29% of that observed at 23 degrees C). The maximum daily food ration (9-4.5% lipid; 57-44% crude protein) at 23 degrees C resulted in feed conversion rates from 1.1 to 2.0 in fish ranging from 1 to 150 g and was modelled as follows (R(2) = 0.89): R(max) (% day(-1)) = 7.60 w (weight, g)(-0.31). Juvenile (1-15 g) perch reared at 10000 fish m(-3) showed a growth rate of 0.2 g fish(-1) day(-1), thus 67% higher than at 400 fish m(-3). In the most intensive rearing trials (124 kg m(-3)), the maximum production rate observed was 2.6 kg m(-3) day(-1). Growth heterogeneity constitutes a major constraint in perch culture. Size grading experiments resulted in the emergence of fast-growing fish in each sorted group. In addition, the sorting process caused the productivity to be slightly lower (5-6%) than in non-sorted populations of the same origin and body weight. Mass mortality may take place at any stage of perch rearing within the 1-200 g body weight range. In general, an overall 50% survival rate was recorded after 14 months. Parasites, bacteria and fungi were the most frequently encountered causes of mortality. The occurrence and impact of diseases were largely reduced in recirculating systems where the survival rate is 70% higher than the values observed in flow-through rearing systems. In intensive rearing systems at 23 degrees C and at maximum stocking biomass of 50 kg m(-3), 44-day- old weaned perch juveniles (ranging from 0.5 to 1 g initial body weight) reached an average body weight of 130-150 g after 1 year of rearing. Still, this marketable size was reached about 3 months earlier by fast growing individuals within the population. The intensive culture of perch at a constant 23 degrees C water temperature allowed much higher growth rates than usually observed in conventional, extensive systems under natural thermal regimes. Constant temperatures also inhibited the sexual maturation in females. Further improvements in growth and productivity in intensive perch rearing will closely rely on techniques such as the selection of fast-growing strains, monosex female or sterile triploid fish production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0175-8659,,,,,DEC,1996,12,3-4,,,,,175,180,,10.1111/j.1439-0426.1996.tb00085.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.1996.tb00085.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996WD04400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The median percentage of primary production (PP) grazed by microzooplankton was relatively constant among the regions and ranged from 49 to 77, with the lowest percentage found in the Westerlies Southern and the highest in the Coastal Indian. Despite strong evidence that microzooplankton grazing impacts were highly variable, no global drivers for this variability (temperature, chlorophyll concentration) were identified in the analysis. As a global carbon budget, the overall consumption of phytoplankton for all regions was 31.3 Gt C year(1), which accounted for 62.4 of the total PP grazed daily. The amount of carbon ingested by micro- and mesozooplankton varied proportionally to the PP and the consumption was five times higher for micro- than for mesozooplankton.

In the present study, no data assimilation is performed. The model is based on the Nucleus for European Models of the Ocean code at the 1/4A degrees resolution, and the simulation was performed without data assimilation by the DRAKKAR project. We show that this simulation correctly reproduces the observed regional sea level trend patterns computed using satellite altimetry data over 1993-2001. Generally, we find that regional sea level change is best simulated in the tropical band and northern oceans, whereas the Southern Ocean is poorly simulated. We examine the respective contributions of steric and bottom pressure changes to the total regional sea level changes. For the steric component, we analyze separately the contributions of temperature and salinity changes as well as upper and lower ocean contributions. Generally, the model results show that most regional sea level changes arise from temperature changes in the upper 750 m of the ocean. However, contributions of salinity changes and deep steric changes can be locally important. We also propose a map of ocean bottom pressure changes. Finally, we assess the robustness of such a model by comparing this simulation with a second simulation performed by MERCATOR-Ocean based on the same core model, but differing by its short length of integration (1992-2001) and its surface forcing data set. The long simulation presents better performance over 1993-2001 than the short simulation, especially in the Southern Ocean where a long adjustment time seems to be needed.",,,,,"Penduff, Thierry/AAH-6554-2021; Garric, Gilles/O-9065-2016","Penduff, Thierry/0000-0002-0407-8564; Garric, Gilles/0000-0002-5385-710X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1616-7341,1616-7228,,,,JUN,2009,59,3,,,,,433,449,,10.1007/s10236-008-0161-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-008-0161-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000266392100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wheat, the second most important cereal crop in India, is sensitive to soil moisture stress. Field experiments were conducted during winter seasons of 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 in a sandy loam soil to evaluate the soil and plant water status in wheat under synthetic (transparent and black polyethylene) and organic (rice husk) mulches with limited irrigation and compared with adequate irrigation with no mulch (conventional practices by the farmers). Though all the mulch treatments improved the soil moisture status, rice husk was found to be superior in maintaining optimum soil moisture condition for crop use. The residual soil moisture was also minimum, indicating effective utilization of moisture by the crop under RH. The plant water status, as evaluated by relative water content and leaf water potential were favourable under RH. Specific leaf weight, root length density and dry biomass were also greater in this treatment. Optimum soil and canopy thermal environment of wheat with limited fluctuations were observed under RH, even during dry periods. This produced comparable yield with less water use, enhancing the water use efficiency. Therefore, it may be concluded that under limited irrigation condition, RH mulching will be beneficial for wheat as it is able to maintain better soil and plant water status, leading to higher grain yield and enhanced water use efficiency.

For that purpose simulations have been carried out for an empty tunnel-type greenhouse with lateral vents, located in Avignon, southern France. The equations of flow are solved with the Fluent (R) CFD package inside and outside the greenhouse. Several series of experimental measurements have been previously carried out using sonic anemometers and a comparative study between measured and calculated values at 48 nodal points of the greenhouse is presented. It is shown that for the three turbulence models, errors on obtained results for temperature as well as humidity remain relatively weak. However, accuracy on velocity modulus as well as on turbulent kinetic energy is more significant in high circulation areas than in other low ones. Neglecting the fluctuations induced by the instability of the measured boundary conditions (intensity and direction of the wind) and the intrusive nature of the measurement tools (sonic anemometers) the experimental data allow us to easily compare the three models.

After transfer they settled to the bottom within few hours. Three treatment groups with two replicates were established with 100 halibut larvae each (initial mean wet weight of 77 mg). Each group was offered one of three diets: live yolk-sac larvae of cod (Gadus morhua L.), newly hatched Artemia salina nauplii, and a combination of the two diets. The water current in the raceways was maintained at 1 cm s(-1). The system was self-cleaning throughout the 19-day experiment; the temperature was kept at 13 degrees C throughout the study. Halibut larvae offered a mixture of the two live organisms and those offered only A. salina had 98 and 99% survival. Halibut larvae offered only cod larvae resulted in an overall survival of 78% at termination. The smallest-sized fraction did not ingest cod larvae on day 7 explaining why almost all of these small halibut larvae died. Percent coverage of the bottom by halibut increased from 5% to 8-10%. Final mean wet weight ranged from 217 to 257 mg for the three groups.

Precipitation fluctuated over the three years. There were four mulching types (NM, flat cultivation with non-mulching; SM, flat cultivation with straw mulching; RP, plastic-mulched ridge plus bare furrow; RPFS, plastic-mulched ridge plus straw-mulched furrow) and three planting densities (LD, low planting density, 45.0x10(3) plants/hm(2); MD, medium planting density, 67.5x10(3) plants/hm(2); HD, high planting density, 90.0x10(3) plants/hm(2)). Results showed that soil temperature was higher with RP and lower with SM compared with NM, but no significant difference was found between RPFS and NM. More soil water was retained by soil mulching at the early growth stage, but it significantly varied at the middle and late growth stages. Maize growth was significantly improved by soil mulching. With increasing planting density, stem diameter, net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content tended to decline, whereas a single-peak trend in biomass yield was observed. Mulching type and planting density did not have significant effect on evapotranspiration (ET), but GY and WUE were significantly affected. There were significant interacting effects of mulching type and planting density on biomass yield, GY, ET and WUE. Compared with NM, RPFS, RP and SM increased GY by 57.5%, 50.8% and 18.9%, and increased WUE by 66.6%, 54.3% and 18.1%, respectively.

Such differences influence soil nitrogen (N) cycling and availability through the year. The main objective of this study was to compare nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil under winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) within three organic and one conventional cropping system that differed in type of fertilizer, presence of catch crops and proportion of N-2-fixing crops. The study was replicated in two identical long-term crop rotation experiments on sandy loam soils under different climatic conditions in Denmark (Flakkebjerg eastern Denmark and Foulum western Denmark). The conventional rotation received 165-170 kg N ha(-1) in the form of NH4NO3, while the organic rotations received 100-110 kg N ha(-1) as pig slurry. For at least 11 months, as from September 2007, static chambers were used to measure N2O emissions at least twice every calendar month. Mean daily N2O emissions across the year ranged from 172 to 438 mu g N m(-2) d(-1) at Flakkebjerg, and from 173 to 250 mu g N m(-2) d(-1) at Foulum. A multiple linear regression analysis showed inter-seasonal variations in emissions (P < 0.001), but annual N2O emissions from organic and conventional systems were not significantly different despite the lower N input in organic rotations. The annual emissions ranged from 54 to 137 mg N m(-2), which corresponded to 0.5-0.8% of the N applied in manure or mineral fertilizer. Selected soil attributes were monitored to support the interpretation of N2O emission patterns. A second multiple linear regression analysis with potential drivers of N2O emissions showed a negative response to soil temperature (P = 0.008) and percent water-filled pore space (WFPS) (P = 0.052) at Foulum. However, there were positive interactions of both factors with NO3-N, i.e., high N2O emissions occurred during periods when high soil nitrate levels coincided with high soil temperature (P = 0.016) or high soil water content (P = 0.056).

Optimum conditions for C. radicans seed germination (74%) were 35/25 C (day/night, 12/12 h) with a 12-h photoperiod. Temperatures below 25/15 C or above 40/30 C were unfavorable for germination. Germination in constant temperatures or in continuous darkness was less than 15%. More than 59% of C. radicans seeds germinated at pH 5 to 9, but at pH 4 or 10 seed germination was totally inhibited.

However, the combined effects of mulching type and planting density on maize growth and yield have been seldom studied, especially in different hydrological years. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of mulching type and planting density on the soil temperature, growth, grain yield (GY), water use efficiency (WUE) and economic benefit of rainfed maize in the drylands of northern China during 2015-2017. Precipitation fluctuated over the three years. There were four mulching types (NM, flat cultivation with non-mulching; SM, flat cultivation with straw mulching; RP, plastic-mulched ridge plus bare furrow; RPFS, plastic-mulched ridge plus straw-mulched furrow) and three planting densities (LD, low planting density, 45.0x10(3) plants/hm(2); MD, medium planting density, 67.5x10(3) plants/hm(2); HD, high planting density, 90.0x10(3) plants/hm(2)). Results showed that soil temperature was higher with RP and lower with SM compared with NM, but no significant difference was found between RPFS and NM. More soil water was retained by soil mulching at the early growth stage, but it significantly varied at the middle and late growth stages. Maize growth was significantly improved by soil mulching. With increasing planting density, stem diameter, net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content tended to decline, whereas a single-peak trend in biomass yield was observed. Mulching type and planting density did not have significant effect on evapotranspiration (ET), but GY and WUE were significantly affected. There were significant interacting effects of mulching type and planting density on biomass yield, GY, ET and WUE. Compared with NM, RPFS, RP and SM increased GY by 57.5%, 50.8% and 18.9%, and increased WUE by 66.6%, 54.3% and 18.1%, respectively. At MD, GY increased by 41.4% and 25.2%, and WUE increased by 38.6% and 22.4% compared with those of at LD and HD. The highest maize GY was observed under MD+RPFS (7023.2 kg/hm(2)), but the value was insignificant under MD+RP (6699.1 kg/hm(2)). Similar trends were observed for WUE under MD+RP and MD+RPFS, but no significant difference was observed between these two combinations. In terms of economic benefit, net income under MD+RP was the highest with a 9.8% increase compared with that of under MD+RPFS.

To determine the proper stocking density for growing pigs under China's production conditions, an experiment with a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement (three levels of space allowance x with/without toys) was conducted to evaluate the effects of space allowance and toy provision on the production performance, behavior and physiology of the pigs from the 7th to 13th week of age. Two hundred and sixteen pigs were randomly allocated to pens with the space allowances of 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 m(2)/pig, and the group size in each pen was fixed at 18. The results showed that the average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the pigs with a space allowance of 0.5 m(2)/pig significantly decreased (P<0.05), while the average daily feed intake (ADFI) did not differ among the groups. Pigs housed in the lower space allowance of 0.5 m(2)/pig spent more time fighting and feeder occupying and less time lying and resting (P<0.05). With larger space allowances of 0.7 and 0.9 m(2)/pig, the surface temperature of the pig body in the middle and later stages after grouping was significantly lower (P<0.05). Toy provision inside the pens effectively decreased the water consumption of pigs at 0.5 m(2)/pig (P>0.01), while no difference was observed in body surface temperature and saliva cortisol concentration among all groups (P>0.05). Pigs gained more weight with toy provision, and their impact was especially enhanced as floor area decreased. Significant interacting effects of space allowance and toy provision on excessive drinker and feeder occupation and negative social behavior were observed (P<0.05). It is concluded that a higher space allowance is beneficial to weight gain, feed conversion and welfare of growing pigs. Toy provision can greatly reduce the excessive occupying behavior and aggression of pigs in barren and crowded environments, indicating that it could improve the growing pig's welfare by enriching the pen environment when the space allowance is limited at the commercial level.

Three warming levels were applied: (i) heated approximately 4 degrees C above ambient; (ii) unheated with snow cover left intact; and (iii) unheated with snow cover removed. Survival and date of emergence were assessed in all years, and beetle lipid content was analyzed in 1 year to determine rates of energy use. 3 Overwinter survival was 6.5-14.5% among years. Winter warming inconsistently affected overwinter survival: increasing survival in one winter, decreasing survival in the warmest winter and having no effect in one winter. Beetles that received supplemental winter warming emerged approximately 2 weeks earlier in spring, and lipid content did not differ among treatment groups. 4 Earlier spring emergence may allow for the production of an additional generation per year of C. trifurcata under future climate change.

For the first time, this study obtains the airflow characteristics in a crushed-rock layer by using high-precision micro wind-velocity detectors. Based on the experimental results, this study verifies the theory that the crushed-rock layer is available for convection heat exchange of porous media in a limited space. In boundary temperature fluctuations conditions, the cooling process is closely related to the natural convection process in the crushed-rock layer, and cooling occurs rapidly during the convection heat transfer process. The warming process, which occurs by heat conduction, happens gradually over a relatively long period of time, resulting in asymmetrical temperature change. The convection process exists only in the increasing and decreasing cooling stages of the entire cooling stage. The temperature difference between the top and the bottom in the crushed-rock layer is a key factor for the occurrence of convection and its intensity, although the air temperature changes also have an effect on the natural convection process in the increasing and decreasing cooling stages. Pore-air natural convection velocity increase is related to the increase in the temperature difference. Due to the different temperature and the penetration resistance of the crushed-rock layer, the velocity rapidly decreases in the depth direction, and there exits a delay phenomenon, so better cooling effect is in accordance with an optimal thickness of the crushed-rock layer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-3674,,,,,AUG,2013,50,8,,,,,834,840,,10.1139/cgj-2011-0201,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cgj-2011-0201,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000322880400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are sound data about the responses of these partnerships to constant temperatures and sporadic thermal stress (mostly heat shock).

This may drastically constrain our ability to predict the fate of mutualistic interactions under climate change, which will alter both mean temperatures and thermal variability. Here, we tackle down these issues by focusing on the effects of temperature fluctuations on the evolutionary ecology of insect-microbe holobionts.

G.; Bugbee, B.",,,An evaluation of the net radiation sub-model in the ASCE standardized reference evapotranspiration equation: Implications for evapotranspiration prediction,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Net radiation (R-n) is a key component of the surface energy balance, but it is expensive and difficult to measure accurately. For these reasons, R-n is often predicted in evapotranspiration (ET) calculations with a model requiring measurements of incoming shortwave radiation, air temperature, and vapor pressure. We compared R-n predictions from the R-n sub-model used in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) standardized reference ET equation to mean R-n measurements from five 4-component reference net radiometers. The radiometers were part of a recent comparison study of multiple net radiometer models conducted over irrigated and clipped turfgrass in northern Utah (Blonquist et al., 2009). In the R-n model, net shortwave radiation is determined by direct measurement of solar radiation and an assumed value of albedo for the surface (0.23 for fully vegetated surfaces), and net longwave radiation is calculated with a Brunt (1932, 1952) approach for predicting net surface emissivity, calculated from near surface vapor pressure. Additionally, the ratio of measured incoming shortwave radiation to predicted clear-sky shortwave radiation is used as a surrogate variable for cloud cover in the net longwave radiation calculation. Relative to the reference R-n measurements (average of five 4-component net radiometers), modeled R-n was high during the day by an average of 8.6% and high in magnitude (more negative) at night by an average of 13.4% over hourly time intervals. Daily total R-n calculated by summing the hourly model predictions was always higher than the reference measurements, by an average of 8.1%, whereas daily total R-n calculated from the model over daily time intervals was closer to the reference measurements, 2% high on average. The model R-n error during the day was partly caused by the assumption in the model that surface albedo is a constant value of 0.23. Measurements showed albedo ranged from approximately 0.21 at solar noon to 0.30 near the beginning and end of the day, with a mean value of 0.23. However, most of the model R-n error was due to the prediction of net longwave radiation, where the empirical equation in the model typically yielded values that were too low in magnitude (less negative), by approximately 20% on average, but the error was dependent on time of day. The R-n error at night was largely caused by the inability to measure the surrogate for cloud cover at night, which relies on measurement of solar radiation from a previous time period of sufficient solar zenith angle. All five of the net radiometer models tested in the comparison study matched the mean of the reference net radiometers better than the ASCE model. When modeled hourly R-n was used to calculate ET over hourly time intervals, or when hourly ET values were summed to yield daily ET, ET was typically high, by 6% on average, relative to ET calculated from measured reference R-n. When modeled R-n was calculated over daily time intervals and used to calculate ET over daily time intervals, ET was more accurate, 1% high on average, relative to ET calculated over daily time intervals from measured reference R-n. While new models for R-n are being developed, the sub-model in the ASCE standardized reference ET equation has been in use for the past two decades in thousands of ET stations. As newer models are developed we hope to use this data set to evaluate them. (C)2010 Elsevier B.V.

A limited energy budget characteristic of this period can result in reduced investment in immune system. Here, we investigated selected physiological and immunological parameters in laboratory-reared and field-collected harlequin ladybirds (Harmonia axyridis). For laboratory-reared beetles, we focused on the effects of winter temperature regime (cold, average, or warm winter) on total haemocyte concentration aiming to investigate potential effects of ongoing climate change on immune system in overwintering insects. We recorded strong reduction in haemocyte concentration during winter; however, there were only limited effects of winter temperature regime on changes in haemocyte concentration in the course of overwintering. For field-collected beetles, we measured additional parameters, specifically: total protein concentration, antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, and haemocyte concentration before and after overwintering. The field experiment did not investigate effects of winter temperature, but focused on changes in inducibility of insect immune system during overwintering, that is, measured parameters were compared between naive beetles and those challenged by Escherichia coli. Haemocyte concentration decreased during overwintering, but only in individuals challenged by Escherichia coli. Prior to overwintering, the challenged beetles had a significantly higher haemocyte concentration compared to naive beetles, whereas no difference was observed after overwintering. A similar pattern was observed also for antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli as challenged beetles outperformed naive beetles before overwintering, but not after winter. In both sexes, total protein concentration increased in the course of overwintering, but females had a significantly higher total protein concentration in their hemolymph compared to males.

What is the current knowledge about these species in European countries, and what management strategies exist so far? We summarised more than 200 references on these topics using common scientific databases. In their original distribution area, habitats suitable for muskrats are characterized by low water level fluctuations and sufficient small water resources, large river banks, and adequate water depths. In newly inhabited areas, different habitat structures are exploited, although an aquatic environment is required. In Europe, the presence of muskrats can lead to habitat changes and consequently, to biodiversity loss. Overall, muskrats are regarded as generally being able to cope well with changing habitat conditions. Feeding on crops merely seems to be a behavior restricted to new settlements in both nutrias and muskrats. Nutrias, too, often achieve a reduction in plant diversity in the habitat through their choice of food in the newly populated areas. Additionally, an urban occurrence along with sightings of the animals during the day is almost exclusively observed in new habitats. Concerning the modeling of nutria population development, low winter temperatures, and aquatic habitats are substantial factors. Research on the reproductive outcome of both species in Europe is rare, and mostly reaches back to before the millennium. However, both species do have larger litter sizes and might reproduce all year round, which is not yet confirmed for all habitats.

Pressure algornetry was carried out twice a week from d 1 after disbudding to determine the mechanical nociceptive threshold (DINT) in 4 locations on each bud (front, lateral, caudal, and middle). At the same time, digital and infrared images of the wounds were used to visually and thermally describe the healing process. Wounds were visually scored daily for the presence of 7 tissue types: attached necrotic tissue, detached necrotic tissue, burns outside the necrotic ring, exudate, granulation, crust, and epithelium. All data were taken until epithelium was present for 4 consecutive days. Necrotic tissue detached completely from the scalp 26 +/- 5 d after the procedure (mean +/- SD; range: 17-43 d), and wounds took 50 +/- 8 d (35-63 d) to re-epithelialize. Wounds were more sensitive at all stages of the healing process compared with re-epithelialized tissue. The caudal and middle locations were the most- and least-sensitive test sites (1.24 +/- 0.10 and 1.90 +/- 0.10 N, respectively; mean +/- SE). Goats became less responsive to stimulation as their wounds decreased in size. Sensitivity did not differ between left and right sides of the head.

The contribution of different coccolithophore species to total calcite production is controlled by inter-species differences in cellular calcite, growth rate and relative abundance within a mixed community. In this study we examined the relative importance of E. huxleyi and two Coccolithus species in terms of daily calcite production. Culture experiments compared growth rates and cellular calcite content of E. huxleyi (Arctic and temperate strains), Coccolithus pelagicus (novel Arctic strain) and Coccolithus braarudii (temperate strain). Despite assumptions that E. huxleyi is a fast-growing species, growth rates between the three species were broadly comparable (0.16-0.85 d(-1)) under identical temperature and light conditions. Emiliania huxleyi grew only 12% faster on average than C. pelagicus, and 28% faster than C. braarudii. As the cellular calcite content of C. pelagicus and C. braarudii is typically 30-80 times greater than E. huxleyi, comparable growth rates suggest that Coccolithus species have the potential to be major calcite producers in mixed populations. To further explore these results we devised a simplistic model comparing daily calcite production from Coccolithus and E. huxleyi across a realistic range of relative abundances and a wide range of relative growth rates. Using the relative differences in growth rates from our culture studies, we found that C. pelagicus would be a larger source of calcite if abundances of E. huxleyi to C. pelagicus were below 34:1. Relative abundance data collected from North Atlantic field samples (spring and summer 2010) suggest that, with a relative growth rate of 88 %, C. pelagicus dominated calcite production at 69% of the sites sampled. With a more extreme difference in growth rates, where C. pelagicus grows at 1 / 10th of the rate of E. huxleyi, C. pelagicus still dominated calcite production in 14% of the field. These results demonstrate the necessity of considering interactions between inter-species differences in growth rates, cellular calcite and relative abundances when evaluating the contribution of different coccolithophores to pelagic calcite production. In the case of C. pelagicus, we find that there is strong potential for this species to make major contributions to calcite production in the North Atlantic, although estimates of relative growth rates from the field are needed to confirm our conclusions.",,,,,"Poulton, Alex J/A-9859-2012; Daniels, Chris/H-2627-2014","Poulton, Alex J/0000-0002-5149-6961; Daniels, Chris/0000-0003-2453-267X; Sheward, Rosie/0000-0001-6857-2038",,,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2014,11,23,,,,,6915,6925,,10.5194/bg-11-6915-2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-6915-2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000346357100027,View Full Record in Web of Science

To determine whether changes in mitochondrial properties could underlie shifts in thermal limits, we examined how mitochondrial properties are affected by thermal acclimation in the eurythermal killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus - a species with substantial plasticity in whole-organism thermal limits. We hypothesized that thermal acclimation would result in functional changes in the mitochondria that could result in trade-offs in function during acute thermal shifts. We measured the mitochondrial respiration rate ((V)over dot(O2)) through multiple complexes of the electron transport system following thermal acclimation (to 5, 15, 33 degrees C) and assessed maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta p) and rates of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as an estimate of costs. Acclimation to 5 degrees C resulted in a modest compensation of mitochondrial respiration at low temperatures, but these mitochondria were able to maintain Delta p with acute exposure to high temperatures, and ROS production did not differ between acclimation groups, suggesting that these increases in mitochondrial capacity do not alter mitochondrial thermal sensitivity. Acclimation to 33 degrees C suppressed mitochondrial respiration as a result of effects on NADH dehydrogenase (complex I). These high-temperature acclimated fish nonetheless maintained levels of Delta p and ROS production similar to those of the other acclimation groups. This work demonstrates that killifish mitochondria can successfully acclimate to a wide range of temperatures without incurring major functional trade-offs during acute thermal shifts and that high-temperature acclimation results in a suppression of metabolism, consistent with patterns observed at the organismal level.",,,,,"Schulte, Patricia M./AAB-3934-2019","Chung, Dillon/0000-0002-0329-3828",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUN,2015,218,11,,,,,1621,1631,,10.1242/jeb.120444,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.120444,,,,,,,,25852066,,,,,WOS:000355602000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experiment tested three water management treatments (continuous flooding, intermittent irrigation, and saturated soil conditions) and three rice variety treatments (unplanted, planted with IR-64, and planted with Cisadane rice) using a split-plot experimental design with three replicates. Methane fluxes were observed during the entire growing period three times per day, one day per week, using a static chamber technique. The results of this study revealed that both water management treatments and rice varieties significantly affected diumal and seasonal variations of methane flux from wetland rice. Rice with continuously flooded irrigation regimes and intermittent irrigation showed that methane fluxes were 1.4 - 1.9 times higher in the afternoon compared to predawn sampling; however, a reverse phenomenon was observed under saturated soil conditions. The diumal methane flux variations observed in this study were most likely due to an average difference of 5 degrees C in soil temperature at 5-cm depth between predawn and afternoon. Water management treatments greatly affected the average daily methane fluxes. In the continuous flooding treatment, the average methane flux of IR-64 was 20 mg/m(2)/hr, greater than that of Cisadane variety (14 mg/m(2)/hr). The seasonal daily average methane flux of Cisadane variety was greater than that of unplanted plots, which was 9.4 mg/m(2)/hr (p = 0.05). In the intermittent irrigation treatment, the methane flux of IR-64 was about equal to that of the Cisadane rice variety (both 8.7 mg/m(2)/hr). However, plots planted with IR-64 and Cisadane emitted more methane than unplanted plots (2.9 mg/m(2)/hr; p = 0.05). In saturated soil, the seasonal daily average methane flux of IR-64 was 8.2 mg/m(2)/hr, greater than that of Cisadane variety (3.2 mg/m(2)/hr); and unplanted plots emitted less methane compared to emissions from both the Cisadane and IR-64 varieties (p = 0.05). This study suggests that rice varieties have significantly different capacities for emitting methane to the atmosphere. The seasonal average daily methane flux of both rice varieties with all water management treatments falls in the range between 4 and 20 mg/m(2)/hr. Based on these data we estimate that methane emissions from Indonesian wetland rice is on average around 13 mg/m(2)/hr. From these data we estimate total methane emission from Indonesian wetland rice to be about 4 Tg/yr (1 Tg = 10(12) g).",,,,,"Murdiyarso, Daniel/M-4245-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0045-6535,,,,,AUG,1995,31,4,,,,,3153,3180,,10.1016/0045-6535(95)00173-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-6535(95)00173-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995RQ40600017,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Singels, A; Bezuidenhout, CN",,,,"Singels, A; Bezuidenhout, CN",,,A new method of simulating dry matter partitioning in the Canegro sugarcane model,FIELD CROPS RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Crop simulation modelling is widely accepted as a useful tool for research and management purposes in agriculture, also in sugar industries worldwide. Successful model application depends on accurate predictions of stalk and sucrose yield. The literature shows that the simulation of dry matter partitioning in sugarcane models such as the Canegro, model could be improved by using source-sink concepts. This should lead to a better understanding of the processes involved and could lead to improved predictions of sucrose yield. With these aims in mind a new dry matter partitioning model was developed and incorporated into the Canegro model, and tested against independent experimental data. In the proposed model, daily partitioning of assimilate between roots and aerial parts is simulated as a non-linear function of total biomass. A constant fraction of aerial dry mass is partitioned to stalk when thermal time since emergence exceeds a given value. The rate of dry matter partitioning to stalk is regarded as the source strength. Partitioning of stalk dry matter is regulated by sink capacity and the source to sink ratio. Sink capacity is dictated by current growing conditions, current stalk mass and varietal characteristics. The sucrose accumulation component of the model is based on a framework of sucrose distribution within stalks as it is affected by temperature and water stress. Values of model parameters for cultivar NCo376 were determined from the literature and by model calibration on data from an experiment conducted at Mount Edgecombe, South Africa. The new and old method of simulating dry matter partitioning was compared to observations from 24 NCo376 crops grown at Umhlanga, La Mercy and Pongola, South Africa. The new method performed better than the old method in all respects. The RMSE of aerial dry mass, stalk dry mass and sucrose mass predictions was 6.94, 5.48 and 2.6 t/ha respectively. These values compare favourably with other models in the literature. The results show that the new method is sufficiently robust to accurately predict aerial dry mass, stalk yield and sucrose yield for a wide range of conditions. It is also capable of simulating subtle changes in partitioning associated with shifts in temperature and water stress conditions. It provides a good platform for further refinement of sugarcane dry matter partitioning such as the inclusion of chemical ripener, nitrogen and variety effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Yet the phenological consequences of photoperiodism for organisms exposed to new climates are often overlooked. We present a conceptual approach and phenology model that maps voltinism (generations per year) and the degree of phenological mismatch that can arise when organisms with a short-day diapause response are introduced to new regions or are otherwise exposed to new climates. Our degree-day-based model combines continent-wide spatialized daily climate data, calculated date-specific and latitude-specific day lengths, and experimentally determined developmental responses to both photoperiod and temperature. Using the case of the knotweed psyllid Aphalara itadori, a new biological control agent being introduced from Japan to North America and Europe to control an invasive weed, we show how incorporating a short-day diapause response will result in geographic patterns of attempted voltinism that are strikingly different from the potential number of generations based on degree-days alone. The difference between the attempted and potential generations represents a quantitative measure of phenological mismatch between diapause timing and the end of the growing season. We conclude that insects moved from lower to higher latitudes (or to cooler climates) will tend to diapause too late, potentially resulting in high mortality from inclement weather, and those moved from higher to lower latitude (to warmer climates) may be prone to diapausing too early, therefore not fully exploiting the growing season and/or suffering from insufficient reserves for the longer duration in diapause. Mapped output reveals a central region with good phenology match that shifts north or south depending on the geographic source of the insect and its corresponding critical photoperiod for diapause. These results have direct relevance for efforts to establish populations of classical biocontrol agents. More generally, our approach and model could be applied to a wide variety of photoperiod- and temperature-sensitive organisms that are exposed to changes in climate, including resident and invasive agricultural pests and species of conservation concern.",,,,,,"Wepprich, Tyson/0000-0002-6875-092X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,APR,2022,32,3,,,,,,,e2557,10.1002/eap.2557,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2557,,MAR 2022,,,,,,35112752,,,,,WOS:000770876200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is hampered by a lack of cooperation between bird breeders or by reluctance to experiment on valuable eggs. The last two problems may be solved by observation of natural incubation, which technology has made a lot easier. Many studies document incubation behavior: daily time spend in the nest, preferred hours of making absences, egg turning rate and incubation temperature. Such data is scientifically interesting but also allows for better protection of endangered species through development of captive breeding programmes. The Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) is a threatened species over much of its European range and various conservation actions are being taken to save populations from global or local extinction. Our study took place in Capercaillie Breeding Centre in Wisla Forestry District and describes nesting and incubation behaviour of Capercaillie females kept in captivity. Our aim was to better document the nesting behaviour by recording egg turning rate, and the time and length of incubation recesses. Time of day and day of incubation had no significant influence on recess length, but the number of recesses was related with time of day with two peaks at 06:00 h and 18:00 h. Egg turning activity was the greatest during the first and last two days of incubation but generally consistent throughout the rest of incubation.

Hope",,,Plant growth chamber design for subambient pCO(2) and C-13 studies,RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY,,,,,,,,,,,,"RationaleSubambient pCO(2) has persisted across the major Phanerozoic ice ages, including the entire late Cenozoic (ca 30Ma to present). Stable isotope analysis of plant-derived organic matter is used to infer changes in pCO(2) and climate in the geologic past, but a growth chamber that can precisely control environmental conditions, including pCO(2) and C-13 value of CO2 (C-13(CO2)) at subambient pCO(2), is lacking. MethodsWe designed and built five identical chambers specifically for plant growth under stable subambient pCO(2) (ca 100 to 400ppm) and C-13(CO2) conditions. We tested the pCO(2) and C-13(CO2) stability of the chambers both with and without plants, across two 12-hour daytime experiments and two extended 9-day experiments. We also compared the temperature and relative humidity conditions among the chambers. ResultsThe average C-13(CO2) value within the five chambers ranged from -18.76 to -19.10; the standard deviation never exceeded 0.14 parts per thousand across any experiment. This represents better C-13(CO2) stability than that achieved by all previous chamber designs, including superambient pCO(2) chambers. Every pCO(2) measurement (n=1225) was within 5% of mean chamber values. The temperature and relative humidity conditions differed by no more than 0.4 degrees C and 1.6%, respectively, across all chambers within each growth experiment. ConclusionsThis growth chamber design extends the range of pCO(2) conditions for which plants can be grown for C-13 analysis of their tissues at subambient levels. This new capability allows for careful isolation of environmental effects on plant C-13 discrimination across the entire range of pCO(2) experienced by terrestrial land plants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0951-4198,1097-0231,,,,AUG 15,2018,32,15,,,,,1296,1302,,10.1002/rcm.8176,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rcm.8176,,,,,,,,29790617,,,,,WOS:000437842100016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drought threats would become worse along with climate change, especially in Northern China where the projected climate change scenarios indicated decreases in precipitation in the arid or semi-arid agricultural areas. Pilot experiments have been launched to search alternative farming management practices for adaptation of the climate change in China. Plastic film mulching (FM) has recently been tested at a number of sites in China with encouraging results although no any regional assessment has been done yet: This paper reports how we met the gap by testing a process-based, biogeochemical model, Denitrification-Decomposition or DNDC, against observations and then utilizing the model to upscale the simulations to a large region in China. DNDC was first modified by including a new module, which tracked variations of soil climate under the film mulching conditions. Two new input parameters, i.e., FM-covering fraction and duration, worked in conjunction with daily weather data to define the daily soil temperature and moisture profiles. By varying the FM coverage or duration, we could simulate a variety of FM settings and their impacts on the soil climate. A 3-year dataset of soil climate as well as crop yield measured at a rainfed corn field in Shaanxi Province in Northwestern China were used to serve the model validation tests. The measured and modeled results were in agreement with each other and both indicated that the FM practice substantially improved the soil moisture as well as the crop yield. Sensitivity tests were conducted with the revised DNDC by varying each of four factors, i.e., precipitation, temperature, soil texture and fertilizer application rate, in its range commonly observed in Northern China while keeping other input factors constant. Results from the sensitivity tests indicated that the effectiveness of FM was mainly related to precipitation. Efficiency of FM increased with decrease of precipitation. The FM effectiveness was evaluated at regional scale by linking DNDC to the databases holding spatially differentiated climate, soil and management data for all the 1.17 million ha of rainfed corn fields in the entire province of Shaanxi, across which the annual average precipitation decreased from 940 mm in the south to 390 mm in the north. Results from the regional simulation indicated that (1) corn production increased by 1.79 million tons or 16% with FM applications in the domain of Shaanxi; (2) the FM-induced increases in corn yield mainly occurred in the northern counties of the province where precipitation was lower than 700 mm; and (3) the effectiveness of FM decreased with increase in precipitation from the northern to the southern areas in the domain. The study concluded that film mulching practice could play an important role in elevating rainfed crop yields in the arid or semi-arid regions in China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Relative abundance of (Z)-9-tricosene (muscalure) among the dominant eight hydrocarbons was determined. Fly heads then were removed to quantify pterin levels and estimate fly age, abdomens were dissected to score gonotrophic development and parity (follicular relics), and spermathecae were examined for sperm. Daily survival was assessed using two estimates of time required to become gravid: laboratory-based degree-day (DD) estimates and estimates based on pterin values in field-collected flies matched to their stages of gonotrophic development. Among newly emerged females (oocyte stage 1) with detectable muscalure, it comprised < approximate to 1.5% of cuticular hydrocarbons. In muscalure-positive flies, muscalure comprised a higher proportion of cuticular hydrocarbons in older flies from California and Minnesota (6-9% when gravid) versus flies from Georgia (<2% when gravid). Females mated in early-intermediate stages of egg development. Life expectancy, using laboratory-derived estimates of time needed to become gravid, ranged from 3.6 to 10.6 d. Using equivalent pterin-based time estimates, life expectancy ranged from 4.0 to 19.5 d. Mean DD ages (12 degrees C threshold) of gravid flies varied widely (53-95 DD) and were congruent with laboratory-based estimates (52-57 DD) in only 7 of 12 farm-year combinations.

Whether such an experiment experiences a representative series of climatic years must be examined in relation to the longer term climatic record. The Cicerone Project's farmlet experiment was conducted on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia, to investigate the profitability and sustainability of three different management systems: one managed under typical, moderate-input conditions (farmlet B); a second which employed a higher level of pasture inputs and soil fertility (farmlet A); and a third which focussed on the use of moderate inputs and intensive rotational grazing (farmlet C). The climate experienced during the 6.5-year experimental period was compared with the 118-year climatic record, using a biophysical simulation model of grazed systems. The model utilised the long-term daily climate data as inputs and provided outputs that allowed comparison of parameters known to affect grazed pastures. Modelled soil-available water, the number of soil moisture stress days (SMSDs) limiting pasture growth, and growth indices over the experimental period (2000-06) were compared with data over the climatic record from 1890 to 2007. SMSDs were defined as when the modelled available soil moisture to a depth of 300 mm was <17% of water-holding capacity. In addition, minimum temperatures and, in particular, the frequency of frosts, were compared with medium-term (1981-2011) temperature records. Wavelet transforms of rainfall and modelled available soil water data were used to separate profile features of these parameters from the noise components of the data. Over the experimental period, both rainfall and available soil water were more commonly significantly below than above the 95% confidence intervals of both parameters. In addition, there was an increased frequency of severe frosting during the dry winters experienced over the 6.5-year period. These dry and cold conditions were likely to have limited the responses to the pasture and grazing management treatments imposed on the three farmlets. In particular, lower than average levels of available soil water were likely to have constrained pasture production, threatened pasture persistence, and reduced the response of the pasture to available soil nutrients and, as a consequence, livestock production and economic outcomes. Ideally, dryland field experimentation should be conducted over a representative range of climatic conditions, including soil moisture conditions both drier and wetter than average. The drier than average conditions, combined with a higher than normal frequency of severe frosts, mean that the results from the Cicerone Project's farmlet experiment need to be viewed in the context of the climate experienced over this 6.5-year period.",,,,,"Murison, Robert/AAI-4706-2021; Behrendt, Karl/ABF-9020-2020; Behrendt, Karl/J-7945-2014","Behrendt, Karl/0000-0003-2905-4996; Behrendt, Karl/0000-0003-2905-4996",,,,,,,,,,,,,1836-0939,1836-5787,,,,,2013,53,7-8,,,,,658,669,,10.1071/AN12300,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN12300,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000321589000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Field measurements of the atmospheric characteristics and lake level during December 1996 through January 1997 are described; using spectrum analysis of synchronous time series. The findings suggest that the variability is due to the diurnal cycle of atmospheric elements. Lake breeze circulation plays an important role in the area of Lake Chapala; since it was registered in 83% of the data. Periodic fluctuations in atmospheric pressure and wind generate significant seiche amplitudes in the lake, with the periods of about 6 h. With the help of a simple model, the seiche parameters are estimated. The amplitude of one-nodal seiches on one of the edges of the lake; is on average equal to 18 mm. This wave should generate currents of approximately 0.012 m s(-)1 at the lake`s centre in the area of the nodal line. The experimental results on the thermal regime and circulation of Lake Chapala are discusssed as well. Surface temperature variations were registered at the eastern part of the lake. In all cross-sections, typical spatial variations of 3 degreesC were registered, over a distance of 100-300 m. A bouy station registered movements of an internal thermal front in the body of the water. The leading edge of the front was accompanied by intense internal waves, in the form of internal KdeV solitones.

However, estimates of biomass production rates (BP) for entire crustacean zooplankton communities are lacking, because conventional field methodology is difficult to apply at the community level. We measured community-level BP using the chitobiase method in an area extending from the west coast of British Columbia, Canada, across the Bering and Chukchi Seas and into the western Beaufort Sea (July 2008, October 2008, and July 2009). Our objective was to measure zooplankton productivity on a scale that was sufficiently broad to allow us to assess the sensitivity of the method to a wide variety of conditions. Overall, variations in temperature and phytoplankton biomass explained 67% of the observed variation in BP. Crustacean zooplankton BP values estimated during July 2008 and 2009 on the Bering Sea shelf were comparable to estimates from one of the very few community-level estimates for this expansive region. Our estimates of the average individual growth rate (daily P/B) for crustacean zooplankton were also comparable to model predictions and direct estimates for the biomass-dominant copepod species in the northern Gulf of Alaska. These observations suggest that the chitobiase method can be used to measure useful estimates of community-level crustacean zooplankton productivity under a broad range of conditions and also provides the basis for further refinement of the technique.

J,"Armitage, DW; Jones, SE",,,,"Armitage, David W.; Jones, Stuart E.",,,Negative frequency-dependent growth underlies the stable coexistence of two cosmopolitan aquatic plants,ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Identifying and quantifying the mechanisms influencing species coexistence remains a major challenge for the study of community ecology. These mechanisms, which stem from species' differential responses to competition and their environments, promote coexistence if they give each species a growth advantage when rare. Yet despite the widespread assumption that co-occurring species stably coexist, there have been few empirical demonstrations in support of this claim. Likewise, coexistence is often assumed to result from interspecific differences in life-history traits, but the relative contributions of these trait differences to coexistence are rarely quantified, particularly across environmental gradients. Using two widely co-occurring and ecologically similar species of freshwater duckweed plants (Spirodela polyrhiza and Lemna minor), we tested hypotheses that interspecific differences in facultative dormancy behaviors, thermal reaction norms, and density-dependent growth promote coexistence between these species, and that their relative influences on coexistence change as average temperatures and fluctuations around them vary. In competition experiments, we found strong evidence for negative frequency-dependent growth across a range of both static and fluctuating temperatures, suggesting a critical role of fluctuation-independent stabilization in coexistence. This negative frequency dependence could be explained by our observation that for both species, intraspecific competition was over 1.5 times stronger than interspecific competition, granting each species a low-density growth advantage. Using an empirically parameterized competition model, we found that while coexistence was facilitated by environmental fluctuations, fluctuation-independent stabilization via negative frequency dependence was crucial for coexistence. Conversely, the temporal storage effect, an important fluctuation-dependent mechanism, was relatively weak in comparison. Contrary to expectations, differences in the species' thermal reaction norms and dormancy behaviors did not significantly promote coexistence in fluctuating environments. Our results highlight how coexistence in two ubiquitous and ostensibly similar aquatic plants is not necessarily a product of their most obvious interspecific differences, and instead results from subtle niche differences causing negative frequency-dependent growth, which acts consistently on both species across environmental gradients.",,,,,"Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021","Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,MAY,2019,100,5,,,,,,,e02657,10.1002/ecy.2657,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2657,,,,,,,,30770565,,,,,WOS:000477642200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

While incubation experiments unambiguously show that constant high temperature accelerates development and shortens embryonic life, studies on the effect of fluctuating temperatures have generated contradictory results. Grass snakes (Natrix natrix) occur at latitudes and altitudes that are unusually cool for an oviparous reptile. In these cool climates females typically lay their eggs in heat-generating anthropogenic microhabitats that provide either a highly fluctuating (compost piles) or a relatively constant (manure heaps) thermal nesting environment. A laboratory experiment with fluctuating and constant incubation temperatures mimicking those recorded in such nests in the field showed that this nest-site dichotomy influences the development of the embryos, and the morphology and locomotor performance of the hatchlings. The incubation period increased at fluctuating temperatures and the fact that the rate of embryonic development showed a decelerating pattern with temperature suggests that periods of low temperature had a relatively larger influence on average development than periods of high temperature. Our study demonstrates how a dichotomy in the nesting environments available to female grass snakes in cool climates can affect variation in the duration of the incubation period and offspring phenotypes in ways that may have consequences for fitness.

In previous studies, a lack of agreement in measurements of plasma corticosterone concentrations and heterophil: lymphocyte (H/L) ratio as physiological indices of stress, caused by hunger and frustration in restricted-fed broiler breeders, was observed. It could be suggested that the differences between previous studies were caused by differences in duration of restriction and time of the day of the measurements. Therefore, in the present study the plasma corticosterone concentration and the H/L ratio were again determined in restricted- and ad libitum-fed growing broiler breeders, taking possible causes of disagreement between previous studies into account. In addition, we measured the daily rhythm in body temperature and heart rate, and the corticosterone responses to an acute stressor as physiological indices of stress. 2. Female broiler breeders (64 per treatment, housed in groups of 4 birds) were used in the experiment. Behaviour, baseline plasma corticosterone concentrations and H/L ratio were determined at 21 d of age (immediately after the start of food restriction), and at 42 and 63 d of age. Body temperature, heart rate and activity were measured by radiotelemetry for 36 h at 49 and 70 d of age. In addition, the plasma corticosterone response to acute stress (5 min manual restraint) was measured at 77 or 78 d of age. 3. Restricted broiler breeders had higher plasma corticosterone concentrations at 42 and 63 d of age, but no differences in H/L ratio were found between restricted birds and unrestricted control birds. Restricted broiler breeders had a higher corticosterone response to 5 min manual restraint than unrestricted birds. Restricted birds displayed a clear day-night rhythm in body temperature, heart rate and activity whereas such a rhythm was blunted in ad libitum-fed birds. 4. It is discussed that some physiological differences (plasma corticosterone concentrations, body temperature and heart rate) between ad libitum-fed and restricted broiler breeders may have been caused by differences in metabolic rate as well as by differences in the level of stress. It is concluded that a combination of behavioural measurements and a wide range of physiological parameters should be used for the assessment of stress in growing broiler breeders.",,,,,"Blokhuis, Harry/A-6023-2013; de Jong, Ingrid/J-5810-2019","Blokhuis, Harry/0000-0003-3608-6355; de Jong, Ingrid/0000-0003-1811-499X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-1668,,,,,MAY,2002,43,2,,,,,157,168,,10.1080/00071660120121355,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071660120121355,,,,,,,,12047078,,,,,WOS:000175337100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

B.",,,EVALUATION OF WINTER FREEZE DAMAGE RISK TO APPLE TREES IN GLOBAL WARMING PROJECTIONS,TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Winter freeze damage affects fruit production regularly in the northern part of North America. This situation, which is related to climatic conditions, financially affects fruit producers and limits the affected areas to the use of cultivars that are freeze-resistant but do not always yield a sufficient market return. The purpose of this study is to conduct an experiment with a newly developed numerical model (W5L+) and its associated snow cover module to evaluate the effects of the projected climatic change on the risk of winter freeze damage to apple trees. The model W5L+ quantifies the risk of freeze damage occurrence at defined locations based on local meteorological records or projections. Risk quantification is achieved by screening daily meteorological time series with pre-identified parameters that are known to be proxies for conditions that result in freeze-damage. The model was parameterized using historical meteorological records from apple orchards in Farnham, southern Quebec, and descriptions of regional winter freeze damaging events that were recorded between 1920 and 2005. In 82% of the years studied, the model was able to identify, correctly the order of magnitude of the recorded freeze events. During the same period, results suggest that extremely low temperatures and prolonged periods of low temperatures were responsible for the majority of damaging events. When used with climatic projections downscaled from a global climate model (GCM), the model predicted a decrease in freeze risk for apple trees at the Farnham orchards in the next 60 years.

In this paper, net primary production (NPP) of Zostera noltei meadows was assessed in the Arcachon Bay (SW France) with the aim of understanding the impact of meadows decline on C sequestration capacity at a basin scale. Net growth rates obtained by means of a year-long leaf-marking experiment (2005-2006) were coupled to interannual biomass measurements (1983-2010) to obtain a direct estimate of NPP. Concurrently, an indirect estimate was obtained through a mathematical model which embedded natural factors variation (temperature, light and nutrients). Z. noltei seasonal growth and leaf morphometry followed a unimodal pattern with a peak in late summer and a minimum in winter; the interannual biomass assessment showed a steadiness at spatial and temporal scales. Net primary production simulated by the mathematical model resulted lower than that obtained by the leaf-marking and biomass method. Moreover, a temporal shift among models was evident, given to the dependence of the simulation mainly on the irradiance. Daily NPP ranged from 0.4 +/- 0.2 to 8.4 +/- 0.4 gm m(-2) d(-1), corresponding to an annual NPP of 1134.2 +/- 100.2 g(Dw) m(-2) y(-1) and to a net C fixation of 362.9 +/- 88.1 g C m(-2) y(-1). By considering the loss of 33% of Z. noltei meadows in the Arcachon Bay in the period 1989-2010, it can be estimated a decline of C sequestration capacity from 24,846 +/- 6030 ton C y(-1) (1989) to 16,564 +/- 4020 ton C y(-1) (2007) at the basin scale.

Heart rate was monitored by a high-speed imaging method, while hemodynamic quantities were evaluated using a particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Experiments were carried out at seven different temperatures (36-42 degrees C with 1 degrees C interval) after 1 h of incubation to stabilize the heart rate. The heart rate increased in a linear manner (r=0.992). Due to the increased cardiac output (or heart rate), the hemodynamic quantities such as mean velocity (U-mean) velocity fluctuation (U-fluc), and peak velocity (U-peak) 1 also increased with respect to the Womersley number (Omega) in the manner r=0.599, 0.693, and 0.725, respectively.

Coral recruitment was measured using settlement tiles deployed at 10 sites along 10 km of shore. The tiles were first deployed in August 2006, and thereafter replaced every 6 months to sample from either August to January, or January to August over 2 years. Seawater temperature was recorded at the 10 sites using logging thermistors, and flow was quantified using drogues. Overall, corals recruited at a rate equivalent to 76 corals m(-2) 6 months(-1), and were represented mostly by poritids (43% of recruits), agaricids (29%), faviids (17%) and siderastreids (7%). Although the density of recruits differed among sites in a pattern that varied among periods and years, there was a consistent trend for mean density to decline from approximate to 4 corals tile(-1) at eastern sites, to <= 1 coral tile(-1) at western sites. One aspect of seawater temperature - the daily range - differed among sites and was greater at western compared to eastern sites, and while it was related inversely to recruitment over one of the sampling periods, it was equivocal as a physical process affecting recruitment Instead, our results are consistent with biophysical coupling involving patch depletion and downstream filtering, whereby patches of coral larvae are delivered to the south shore of St. John and depleted of larvae through settlement as the water progresses westward.

Objective To investigate whether environmental factors can influence symptomatology in non-allergic non-infectious perennial rhinitis (NANIPER) patients, who suffer primarily from nasal hyper-reactivity symptoms. Methods We studied 16 non-smoking NANIPER patients and seven non-smoking controls during a 218-day study period (March-October) by means of daily symptom scores and visual analogue scales for the subsets patency, secretions and sneezing, and compared them to seven primary factors which affected 'symptoms' and 10 secondary factors which affected primary factors only. Results The mean symptom scores in the NANIPER and control groups were 2.17 and 0.13, respectively. In NANIPER, the highest correlations of primary factors with symptomatology were found for symptom scores and sneezing with minimum daytime temperature (r = -0.62 and -0.45, respectively), ozone and NO concentrations. Patency and secretions were associated with minimum daytime temperature (r = -0.39 and 0.32, respectively). Time series analysis, however, correcting for several confounders such as autocorrelated symptomatology, showed that minimum daytime temperature and daytime relative humidity made an independent contribution to symptoms. In the control group, correlations were much lower, though present. Time series analysis was not possible. Conclusions We conclude that in a mild climate with relatively low levels of pollution, minor pollution and meteorological disturbances result in substantial changes in nasal reactivity symptoms in NANIPER patients, but not controls, irrespective of other factors such as allergy or infection.",,,,,"Fokkens, Wytske WJ/ABF-2185-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0954-7894,1365-2222,,,,MAY,2002,32,5,,,,,690,697,,10.1046/j.1365-2222.2002.01359.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2222.2002.01359.x,,,,,,,,11994091,,,,,WOS:000175436400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The nonlinearity associated with the use of this coupled mode has attracted great attention. Theoretical models have been developed for decoupling indoor air temperature and ventilation flow rate for buildings exposed to harmonically fluctuating external thermal environments. However, the solutions in existing models are implicit and only the main fluctuation frequency of indoor environmental parameters is accounted for. This paper focuses on multi-frequency fluctuation behaviors induced by the coupling between thermal mass and buoyancy-driven natural ventilation. A mathematical approach is undertaken to decouple the indoor air temperature and ventilation flow rate, and explicit solutions are obtained for both the phase shift and fluctuation amplitude of the indoor air temperature and ventilation flow rate at various frequencies. Experiments are performed to validate the theoretical analysis. Both analytical and experimental results show that coupling between thermal mass and buoyancy inside a building can lead to multi-frequency (or anharmonic) fluctuation of natural ventilation. The phase shifts of the high-order indoor air temperature fluctuation terms (with respect to the 1st-order outdoor air temperature fluctuation term) can exceed pi/2. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A sex-distorting autosomal transgene has been developed recently in G3 mosquitoes, a laboratory strain of the malaria vectorAnopheles gambiaes.l. The transgene expresses an endonuclease called I-PpoI during spermatogenesis, which selectively cleaves the X chromosome to result in similar to 95% male progeny. Following the World Health Organization guidance framework for the testing of GM mosquitoes, we assessed the dynamics of this transgene in large cages using a joint experimental modelling approach. We performed a 4-month experiment in large, indoor cages to study the population genetics of the transgene. The cages were set up to mimic a simple tropical environment with a diurnal light-cycle, constant temperature and constant humidity. We allowed the generations to overlap to engender a stable age structure in the populations. We constructed a model to mimic the experiments, and used the experimental data to infer the key model parameters. We identified two fitness costs associated with the transgene. First, transgenic adult males have reduced fertility and, second, their female progeny have reduced pupal survival rates. Our results demonstrate that the transgene is likely to disappear in <3 years under our confined conditions. Model predictions suggest this will be true over a wide range of background population sizes and transgene introduction rates. Synthesis and applications. Our study is in line with the World Health Organization guidance recommendations in regard to the development and testing of GM mosquitoes. Since the transgenic sex ratio distorter strain (Ag(PMB)1) has been considered for genetic vector control of malaria, we recorded the dynamics of this transgene in indoor-large cage populations and modelled its post-release persistence under different scenarios. We provide a demonstration of the self-limiting nature of the transgene, and identified new fitness costs that will further reduce the longevity of the transgene after its release.

The experimental work was based on operating the mobile laboratory in the Mansouriya residential area for a period of 1 month (May 1994). The site was selected to represent a typical residential area which is impacted mainly by the heavy traffic into and out of Kuwait city. The levels of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) were selected for analysis. These are the pollutants likely to result from traffic movement in any urban area. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) was also monitored during the same period. The measured variables include some meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, wind speed and wind direction, which were also recorded at the same time. The study investigates the atmospheric levels of pollutants in the Mansouriya area and the expected source contributing to these pollutants. The objective of this work was to measure the atmospheric levels of pollution in terms of NO, CO, NO2, SO2 and O-3 and to compare with the international standard limits for urban areas. Another objective of the study was to study the diurnal variations of these pollutants. The results of this study indicate that the levels of air pollutants are within the recommended range for residential areas according to US Environmental Protection Agency standards. The distribution of CO was correlated with heavy traffic movement during rush hours. However, SO2 levels also followed a similar pattern. This was attributed to heavy diesel operational equipment and trucks at the highway construction site near the area of study. The hourly distributions of CO, NO and NO2 were also compared over the days of the week. The results show that no morning peaks were detected for these gases during weekends. Correlation between O-3 levels and NO and NO2 was also carried out. The O-3 levels show a peak at the early morning hours and a major peak during midday. This is attributed to the photochemical reactions during the month of May which is the real start of summer in this area. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Chev.)]. Although growers use fungicides for disease control, cost-effective disease management decisions require a reliable measure of disease potential within an orchard. A systems dynamics approach was used to model sclerotinia disease development using ithink(TM) software. The model's construction was based on interactions between the pathogens life cycle, crop phenology and the environment. A positive relationship between apothecial density and disease incidence was used, with a series of biological clocks and environmental thresholds, to predict disease potential at the end of flowering. Crop loss was predicted from flowering to mid-season in response to daily rainfall exceeding thresholds. Simulations were performed using five years climate data from Te Puke Research Orchard standard mean daily temperature and rainfall thresholds of 15degreesC and 10 mm day(-1) and an apothecial density of 1.0 m(-2). The responsiveness of simulated disease potential and crop loss, to changes in apothecial density and environmental thresholds, ranged from -54% to +100%, relative to the standard inputs. Changing the date of bud-burst by 7 days affected these outputs by -56% to +61%, depending on the season and region. The model produces stable and realistic outputs under conditions typical of New Zealand kiwifruit vineyards, although validation with independent experimental data is required. The systems dynamics approach has provided a platform that readily incorporates phenological and environmental interactions into a framework of the pathogens life cycle over a multi-year timeframe. Alterations to the model can be made to incorporate new relevant experimental data and new components, including other kiwifruit models. This model could also be revised to describe other pathosystems, through simple modifications and replacement of key epidemiological equations within the model.

To date, however, the influence of sloughing on the susceptibility of amphibians to infection and disease has been largely overlooked. To investigate the potential for sloughing to regulate topical microbial loads, the abundance of cultivable cutaneous bacteria and fungi in the cane toad Rhinella marina were compared before and after sloughing. Toads were also exposed to fluctuating thermal regimes (10-20 and 20-30 degrees C) and variable photoperiods to investigate possible effects of season and climate on sloughing periodicity. Sloughing substantially reduced the abundance of cultivable cutaneous bacteria and fungi by up to 100%. The intermoult interval of toads maintained at 10-20 degrees C was twice that of animals at 20-30 degrees C and did not appear to thermally acclimate. Photoperiod had no discernable influence on sloughing periodicity. Results of this study suggest that normal sloughing cycles could play a significant role in controlling the persistence and build-up of cutaneous microbes, including pathogens. The loss of non-pathogenic commensal and protective skin microbiota after sloughing may also influence host susceptibility to cutaneous pathogens. We suggest that the spatio-temporal dynamics of chytridiomycosis, the widespread and often fatal disease caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, are related to temperature not only because of its effect on the growth of the fungus, but also because of its effect on the frequency of host sloughing.",,,,,"Cramp, Rebecca L/A-4488-2010; Franklin, Craig/G-7343-2012","Cramp, Rebecca L/0000-0001-9798-2271; Franklin, Craig/0000-0003-1315-3797; Bernal, Manuel Hernando/0000-0003-0940-4514",,,,,,,,,,,,,0177-5103,1616-1580,,,,NOV 19,2012,101,3,,,,,235,242,,10.3354/dao02523,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao02523,,,,,,,,23324420,,,,,WOS:000312357300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation is particularly key for understanding the formation of ice in clouds, which impacts weather and climate. While many effective ice nucleators are known, the mechanisms of their actions remain poorly understood. Some inorganic nucleators have been found to nucleate ice at warmer temperatures in dilute ammonium solution than in pure water. This is surprising, analogous to salty water melting at a warmer temperature than pure water. Here, the magnitude of this effect is rationalized as being due to thermodynamically favorable ammonium-induced disordering of the hydrogen bond network of ice critical clusters formed on inorganic ice nucleators. Theoretical calculations are shown to be consistent with new experimental measurements aimed at finding the maximum magnitude of the effect. The implication of this study is that the ice-nucleating sites and surfaces of many inorganic ice nucleators are either polar or charged and, therefore, tend to induce formation of hydrogen-ordered ice clusters. This work corroborates various literature reports, indicating that some inorganic ice nucleators are most effective when nominally neutral, and implies a commonality in mechanism between a wide range of inorganic ice nucleators.& nbsp;Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.& nbsp;",,,,,"Whale, Thomas/C-6205-2015","Whale, Thomas/0000-0002-1062-2685",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-9606,1089-7690,,,,APR 14,2022,156,14,,,,,,,144503,10.1063/5.0084635,http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0084635,,,,,,,,35428394,,,,,WOS:000794869300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A. canorus lives only in California's central Sierra Nevada at medium to sub-alpine elevations. Lands throughout its range are protected from development, but climate and other global-change factors potentially can limit populations. A. canorus reproduces in ultra-shallow wetlands that typically hydrate seasonally via melting of the winter snowpack. Lesser snowpacks in drier years can render wetland water volumes and hydroperiods insufficient to allow for successful breeding and reproduction. Additionally, breeding and embryogenesis occur very soon after wetlands thaw when overnight temperatures can be below freezing. Diseases, such as chytridiomycosis, which recently decimated regional populations of ranid species, also might cause declines of A. canorus populations. However, reported studies focused on whether climate interacts with any pathogens to affect fitness in A. canorus have been scarce. We investigated effects of these factors on A. canorus near Tioga Pass from 1996 to 2001. We found breeding sub populations were distributed widely but inconsistently among potentially suitable wetlands and frequently consisted of small numbers of adults. We occasionally observed small but not alarming numbers of dead adults at breeding sites. In contrast, embryo mortality often was notably high, with the majority of embryos dead in some egg masses while mortality among coincidental Pseudacris regilla (Pacific treefrog) embryos in deeper water was lower. After sampling and experimentation, we concluded that freezing killed A. canorus embryos, especially near the tops of egg masses, which enabled Saprolegnia diclina (a water mold [Oomycota]) to infect and then spread through egg masses and kill more embryos, often in conjunction with predatory flatworms (Turbellaria spp.). We also concluded exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation did not play a role. Based upon our assessments of daily minimum temperatures recorded around snow-off during years before and after our field study, the freezing potential we observed at field sites during embryogenesis might have been commonplace beyond the years of our field study. However, interactions among snow quantity, the timing of snow-off, and coincidental air temperatures that determine such freezing potential make projections of future conditions highly uncertain, despite overall warming trends. Our results describe important effects from ongoing threats to the fitness and abundance of A. canorus via reduced reproduction success and demonstrate how climate conditions can exacerbate effects from pathogens to threaten the persistence of amphibian populations.

That of the second instar larva was the shortest (2.1 days) followed by the third instar larva (3.1 days). The longest developmental period (approximately 5 days) was recorded for the egg, first- and fourth-instar larvae and pupa. Oviposition commenced after 1 week of adult life and peaked in the 5th week with 37.2 female eggs/female. All ovipositing females survived the first 9 weeks of adult life when 82% of the total eggs were laid. By the 13th week, which was the effective end of reproduction (98% fecundity) only 40% of the females had died. Both capacity for increase (r(c)) and intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) were calculated for E. troberti and found to be 0.092/day and 1.105/day, respectively. Mean daily predation rates in non-choice experiments on the second instar nymphs of P. manihoti by the fourth, third and second instar larvae of E. troberti were 28.3, 15.6 and 8.0, respectively. On the third instar nymphs and fourth instar young adults of P. manihoti the mean daily predation rates by the fourth, third and second instar larvae of E. troberti were 17.6, 8.3 and 4.5; and 4.0, 3.0 and 1.0, respectively. The populations of E. troberti, other coccinellid predators and P. manihoti were monitored in two small local farms for three seasons. E. troberti was found to be the dominant coccinelid predator in terms of numbers of individuals found in the field during the years of this experiment. the cyclical population oscillations of P. manihoti were similar in all the experimental years but differed only in the amplitude of oscillations. Those of E. troberti and the other coccinellid predators were lower than those of P. manihoti.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0191-9040,,,,,,1990,11,2,,,,,189,195,,10.1017/S1742758400010560,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1742758400010560,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1990EN84400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

During winter, wide-ranging high densities occurred in most of the Gulf of California. Densities decreased considerably during summer, with only at few locations having high densities. N. simplex made short daily vertical migrations of <150 m with pronounced vertical seasonal ontogenetic segregation. In winter, most life stages, particularly gravid and ovigerous females, were found in the top 100 m at night, with temperatures <17 degrees C throughout the normal, cold, well-mixed water column. During summer, a seasonal thermocline at similar to 50 m formed with temperatures between 22-29 degrees C above the thermocline. Reproductive females and males were found below the thermocline at >50 m, clearly avoiding layers with temperatures >20 degrees C. In both seasons. N. simplex occurred above the low-oxygen layer ( <1.5 ml l(-1)), which occurred at 150 m during winter and 90 m during summer. In summer, this layer extended farther north and into shallower water columns than during winter. The low-oxygen layer acts as the bottom limit of vertical distribution and horizontal distribution is limited at the southern part of the gulf to temperatures >23 degrees C. Seasonal brood size and reproductive effort were estimated for both sides of the Baja California Peninsula under ship board experiments as a proxy of the relative effect of seasonal environmental conditions for euphausiid reproduction. Experiments were done during March, July, and December 2004 at the entrance to Bahia Magdalena and its westward continental shelf and in November 2005 and January and July 2007 in the Gulf of California. Contrary to broadcast-spawning euphausiids, N. simplex, a sac-spawning euphausiid, has a significant association of the brood size as a function of the total length of females. N. simplex produces an average brood of 52 eggs female(-1) (range 5-116 eggs female(-1)) with a estimated total fecundity of 936 eggs female(-1) in a life span (360-1337 eggs female(-1)), of which about 8% of its carbon weight is released per spawn, significantly higher than estimates of previous studies. In Bahia Magdalena, broods contained more embryos in March and July 2004 than in December 2004 when temperatures increased to >23 degrees C. In the Gulf of California, broods had higher numbers of embryos in November and July than in January 2007, suggesting that N. simplex has an out-of-phase reproductive season on both coasts of the peninsula. Reproductive investment effort was larger in the Gulf of California than in Bahia Magdalena, where females generated up to 18.3% of their weight in their broods, primarily by brood sizes produced from females between 10-12 mm total length that were particularly fecund during November and July.

The present paper explores the use of acoustics for the remote sensing of physiological processes of aquatic plants in relation to the environment, dealing specifically with the leaf photosynthesis of seagrasses at the scale of a prairie. An exploratory study started in spring 1995 on the basis of long-range transmission measurements carried out over a prairie of Posidonia oceanica, an endemic phanerogam of the Mediterranean Sea. Results of a shorter-range experiment carried out at the end of the summer 1999 in the Ustica Island marine reserve (Sicily) are hereby presented. Acoustic signal propagation and ambient noise due to biological processes were measured during four days under controlled experimental conditions. Chirp signals were emitted repeatedly from a broadband sound source and received on a two-hydrophone vertical array; the range was 53 m and the frequency band was 0.216 kHz, broader than during the first experiment. Ground truth data of dissolved oxygen and temperature in the acoustic section were obtained contemporaneously. Detailed statistical analyses of the medium impulse responses, and in particular of their energy time distribution, allowed detecting cyclic variations of the sound propagation characteristics. Some of the latter are strongly correlated with the release of photosynthetic oxygen measured above the foliage by a dissolved oxygen sensor. Photosynthesis is shown to produce excess attenuation of certain acoustic paths and a faster decay of reverberation. The main diurnal variations are ascribed to non dissolved gases that are present in the air channels running inside and along the length of the leaf blades, and to the production of oxygen microbubbles sticking to the blade surface. Other variations can be attributed to gas movements in the rhyzome and root systems. The Posidonia prairies form a thick layer where gas void fraction varies with the phase of photosynthesis cycle. During the active phases sound speeds lower than in bubble-free seawater, together with absorption and scattering effects, modify the multiple reflections from the rocky substratum. In our experimental setup, modeling results explain why the multipaths with intermediate grazing angles are the most sensitive to photosynthesis. The results confirm the ones obtained in the first experiment of 1995, even if conducted under quite different environmental conditions and with a different measuring arrangement. They indicate that in situ measurements of photosynthesis by acoustic methods can provide new insights into the physiology of seagrasses and in particular their response to environmental forcing, at the scale of a prairie. The study is not intended to be species-specific, being now extended to other temperate seagrass species like Cymodocea sp. and Zostera sp. acoustic measurements with in-situ hydrographic data and comprehensive modeling of the seagrass scattering and absorption mechanisms in the frequency band of interest. Furthermore, our research confirmed that the behavior and the movements both of fish and benthic organisms can be contemporaneously monitored, improving greatly the possibility of an indirect, non invasive study with the possibility of collecting data inaccessible so far as further discussed in [19). The proposed method is not specific to Posidonia seagrass; other temperate seagrass species includinig Cymodocea sp. and Zostera sp. are currently being studied. Extension and application of the method for a much longer observation period would allow studying not only the species-specific response to any environmental forcing but also the relationships between leaf photosynthesis and seasonal plant growth and productivity as well as the differences in the seasonal pattern among species, at the scale of a prairie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1-4020-4372-4,,,,2006,,,,,,,183,196,,10.1007/978-1-4020-4386-4_14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-4386-4_14,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000241652600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Soil respiration is usually divided in a fraction originating from root respiration and a heterotrophic fraction originating from microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon. This paper reports on the coupling of an one-dimensional water, heat and CO2 flux model (SOILCO2) with a pool concept of carbon turnover (RothC) for the prediction of soil heterotrophic respiration. In order to test this coupled model, it was applied to a bare soil experimental plot located in Bornim, Germany. Soil temperature and soil water content measurements were used for comparison with the respective model predictions. An 8 years data set Of CO2 efflux measurements, covering a broad range of atmospheric conditions, was used to evaluate the model. In a first step we quantified the improvement of the CO2 efflux prediction due to the coupling of the flux model with a pool concept of carbon turnover. The humus pool decomposition rate constant and its soil water content dependent reduction were derived from the first 5 years Of CO2 efflux measurements using inverse modelling. The following 3 years of measurements were used to validate the model. The overall model performance Of CO2 efflux predictions was acceptable with the measured and simulated mean daily respiration being 0.861 and 0.868 g C m(-2) d(-1), respectively, and a mean absolute difference between modelled and measured rates of 0.21 g C m(-2) d(-1). The inverse estimation of the humus decomposition rate constant resulted in a value of 0.04 year(-1), which is higher than the default value in RothC. This is attributed to the agricultural practice during the experiment. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This experiment focuses on simulations of land-surface water and energy fluxes in the 58,000-km(2) Tome and Kalix river systems in northern Scandinavia, during the period 1989-1998. All models participating in PILPS Phase 2(e) capture the broad dynamics of snowmelt and runoff, but large differences in snow accumulation and ablation, turbulent heat fluxes, and strearnflow exist. The greatest among-model differences in energy and moisture fluxes in these high-latitude environments occur during the spring snowmelt period, reflecting different model parameterizations of snow processes. Differences in net radiation are governed by differences in the simulated radiative surface temperature during the winter months and by differences in surface albedo during the spring/early summer. Differences in net radiation are smallest during the late summer when snow is absent. Although simulated snow sublimation is small for most models, a few models show annual snow sublimation of about 100 mm. These differences in snow sublimation appear to be largely dependent on differences in snow surface roughness parameterizations. The models with high sublimation generally lose their snowpacks too early compared to observations and underpredict the annual runoff. Differences in runoff parameterizations are reflected in differences in daily runoff statistics. Although most models show a greater variability in daily strearnflow than the observations, the models with the greatest variability (as much as double the observed variability), produce most of their runoff through fast response, surface runoff mechanisms. As a group, those models that took advantage of an opportunity to calibrate to selected small catchments and to transfer calibration results to the basin at large had a smaller bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) in daily streamflow simulations compared with the models that did not calibrate.

Since it was developed in the late 1990s, the GRAZPLAN pasture growth model has not been updated to reflect modern genotypes and has not been widely validated across the range of climates and farming systems in which lucerne is grown in modern times. Therefore, the capacity of GRAZPLAN to predict lucerne growth and development was assessed. This was done by re-estimating values for some key parameters based on information in the scientific literature. The improved GRAZPLAN model was also assessed for its capacity to reflect differences in the growth and physiology of lucerne genotypes with different winter activity. Modifications were made to GRAZPLAN to improve its capacity to reflect changes in phenology due to environmental triggers such as short photoperiods, declining low temperatures, defoliation and water stress. Changes were also made to the parameter governing the effect of vapour pressure on the biomass-transpiration ratio and therefore biomass accumulation. Other developments included the representation of root development and partitioning of canopy structure, notably the ratio leaf:stem dry matter. Data from replicated field experiments across Australia were identified for model validation. These data were broadly representative of the range of climate zones, soil types and farming systems in which lucerne is used for livestock grazing. Validation of predicted lucerne growth rates was comprehensive owing to plentiful data. Across a range of climate zones, soils and farming systems, there was an overall improvement in the capacity to simulate pasture dry matter production, with a reduction in the mean prediction error of 0.33 and the root-mean-square deviation of 9.6kg/ha.day. Validation of other parts of the model was restricted because information relating to plant roots, soil water, plant morphology and phenology was limited.

Nonpregnant greyhound bitches (n=18) received sodium cloprostenol subcutaneously, via a miniosmotic pump, at dose rates of 0.875 to 4.5 mu g/kg/24 h, for 7 days (Days 0 to 7). Daily water intake was measured from Day -2 to Day 9. Polydipsia was observed in bitches treated with the higher dose rates but not in bitches treated with the lowest dose rate of 0.875 mu g/kg/24 h. In the second experiment, pregnant greyhound bitches received sodium cloprostenol at dose rates of 1 (n=4), 2 (n=1) and 3 mu g/kg/24 h (n=1), on Day 57 of pregnancy. Polydipsia was observed in bitches treated at the higher dose rates of 2 and 3 mu g/kg/24 h, but not in the bitches treated at the Lower dose rate of 1 mu g/kg/24 h. These treatments resulted in the successful induction of parturition. Parturition was associated with a decrease in plasma progesterone concentrations, a reduction in body temperature, and an increase in plasma concentrations of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin F-2 alpha. The first puppy was born 37.7 +/- 2.9 h after the start of treatment (range 28 to 46 h). The duration of whelping was approximately 15.7 +/- 2.2 17 (range 10 to 24 h). The litter size was 9.2 +/- 0.8 pups (range 6 to 12 pups), and the puppy survival rate was 6.0 +/- 0.8 per litter (range 4 to 9 pups). This study demonstrated that the administration of sodium cloprostenol in continuous low dose for 24 h is an effective treatment for the induction of parturition in bitches during late pregnancy. This treatment resulted in the birth of healthy pups, with minimal or no side effects to the bitch.

The propagation of discharge and thermal waves is asynchronous, causing the benthic community to undergo two different but consecutive impacts. Invertebrates respond to sudden increases in discharge with catastrophic drift, and respond to sudden changes of temperature with behavioural drift. Owing to the time lag separating discharge and thermal wave peaks, catastrophic and behavioural drift can occur as distinct events. We conducted simulations in a set of open air flumes directly fed by an Alpine stream, and analysed drift induction in benthic invertebrates caused by a HP wave followed by a cold TP wave, and compared it with drift induced only by a cold TP wave. Drift propensity increased during HP and TP simulations, with a synergic effect: drift was higher when the TP wave followed the HP one. We also recorded a selective effect: some taxa did not respond to the alterations, some taxa responded to the discharge variations and to the thermal variations, or to the thermal variations alone. The most abundant taxa in benthos were Chironomidae and Baetidae, followed by Simuliidae. Simuliidae and Chironomidae were the most abundant drifting taxa.

K.",,,Riverine regime shifts through reservoir dams reveal options for ecological management,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Worldwide, dams are a main threat reducing river ecological functioning and biodiversity by severely altering water temperature, flow, and sediment regimes up- and downstream. Sustainable dam management therefore has a key role in achieving ecological targets. Here, we present an analysis of the effects of reservoir dams and resulting regime shifts on community structure and function of lotic macroinvertebrates. Our study derived management options to improve ecological integrity of affected streams. To do this, we contrasted time series data for water temperature (15-min intervals over one year), discharge (daily means over 10 yr), and records of deposited fine sediments against macroinvertebrate samples from pairs of river reaches downstream of dams and of comparable tributaries not affected by dams in the German low mountain range. We observed a decline in the density and diversity of disturbance-sensitive macroinvertebrates (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) and a correlation between hydrologic metrics and macroinvertebrate deterioration downstream of the dams. Typical rhithral (flow-adapted) species changed to littoral (flow-avoiding) species below dams, thus indicating a hydrologic regime shift. Increased fine sediment accumulations and deficits of pebbles and small cobbles below dams indicated a severe habitat loss below dams. Additional comparison with undisturbed reference streams allowed us to derive management options that could mitigate the negative impact of hydrologic alterations and accumulations of fine sediments downstream of dams. These options are conditional on the season and in particular address the frequency and duration of low and high flow events.",,,,,"Sures, Bernd/B-6652-2013","Meissner, Thomas/0000-0001-7841-9168; Sures, Bernd/0000-0001-6865-6186",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,OCT,2018,28,7,,,,,1897,1908,,10.1002/eap.1786,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.1786,,,,,,,,30062752,,,,,WOS:000446009900019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The method was validated in green iguanas at ambient temperature and humidity levels occurring on Curacao. Energy expenditures from the DLW method differed by 2.1 +/- 8.2% compared to respirometry and balance methods. This value falls within the range of deviations found in other validation studies, and indicates that the DLW method is acceptable in green iguanas even at high ambient humidity. 2) Average DEE was 71.7 kJ . kg-1.d-1. There were no significant differences in DEE between males and females, although males tended to have higher metabolic rates during the mating season. Energy expenditure on a yearly basis including clutch production in females did not differ between females and males, indicating comparable annual levels of energy expenditure between the sexes. 3) Temperature dependence of standard metabolic rate (SMR) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were determined by respirometry experiments. RMR increased with temperature with a Q10 of 2.24. In combination with field body temperatures SMR and RMR of free-living iguanas could be determined. SMR amounted to 15-22% of the DEE. DEE was 1.8-2.8 times RMR. 4) The energy expenditure above RMR was allocated between activities involving locomotion and stationary activities. DEE in combination with behavioral data revealed an indirect measure of the costs linked to locomotion in the field, including climbing (255 kJ.km-1.kg-1). Locomotion with a climbing component imposed six times the costs of horizontal walking. Although time spent locomoting was only a very small fraction of the total time, the costs linked to locomotor activities amounted to almost-equal-to 23% of the daily energy expenditure. Postural adjustment costs were almost-equal-to 33% of the DEE. Locomotion could explain 78% of the observed variation in DEE. If other activities, such as foraging and social activities, were included in multiple regression analyses, 96% of the variation in DEE could be explained. 5) Body condition of males decreased during the mating period (March/April), while most of the decrease in body condition of females occurred during the time of oviposition (May/June). Time spent in social activities was higher during the mating period, especially so in males, but time devoted to other activities (locomotion, foraging) did not differ significantly between the seasons. Comparison between the sexes revealed that males spent more time locomoting than females, throughout the year. 6) Differences in body condition in the course of the year were not due to differences in DEE, but were mainly a result of differences in metabolizable energy intake. Though on a yearly basis energy expenditure was equal in both sexes, energy allocation differed between the sexes. Females devoted almost-equal-to 15% of their annual energy budget to the production of eggs, while males showed heightened social activity during the mating phase and spent twice as much time in locomotor activities than females.",,,,,"Wesselingh, Renate A./F-4240-2011","Wesselingh, Renate A./0000-0003-0241-2255",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JUN,1993,74,4,,,,,1157,1172,,10.2307/1940486,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1940486,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LD02200020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three experimental diets (30% protein) were formulated using fish meal, meat and bone meal, mustard oilcake, sesame meal and rice bran in different combinations partially replacing fish meal by meat and bone meal and sesame meal and assigned to treatments T-1, T-2 and T-3 respectively. A commercial golda feed (Starter-III) was assigned to T-4 (reference diet). Each treatment had three replicates. Juveniles of M. rosenbergii (2.90 +/- 0.21 g) were stocked at the rate of 40 000 ha(-1). Prawns were fed three times daily at the rate of 10% and 5% of their body weight at the beginning and for the last 2 months respectively. The ponds were provided with aeration during the night using air pumps. The ranges of water quality parameters recorded in different ponds were: temperature 28.9-32.5 degrees C, dissolved oxygen 5.1-8.1 mg L-1 and pH 6.4-7.7. The results showed that the weight gain of prawns fed diet 1 was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those fed diets 2 and 3, but was not significantly different from those fed diet 4 (reference diet). The feed conversion ratio (FCR) values of diets ranged between 2.21 and 2.96 with diets 1 and 4 showing significantly lower (P < 0.05) FCR values. The survivals (%) ranged between 68% and 78% with prawns fed diets 1 and 4 showing significantly higher survival. The production of prawn ranged between 921 and 1428 kg ha(-1) and diet 1 resulted in a significantly high (P < 0.05) production. A simple economic analysis showed that diet 1 generated the maximum net profit of Tk 159 178 ha(-1).

Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a widespread phenomenon among marine and freshwater organisms and many studies with various taxa have sought to understand its adaptive significance. Among crustacean zooplankton and juveniles of some fish species DVM is accepted widely as an antipredator behaviour, but little is known about its adaptive value for relatively large-bodied, adult predatory fish such as sharks. Moreover, the majority of studies have focused on pelagic forms, which raises the question of whether DVM occurs in bottom-living predators. 2. To investigate DVM in benthic predatory fish in the marine environment and to determine why it might occur we tracked movements of adult male dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula) by short- and long-term acoustic and archival telemetry. Movement studies were complemented with measurements of prey abundance and availability and thermal habitat within home ranges. A thermal choice experiment and energy budget modelling was used to investigate trade-offs between foraging and thermal habitat selection. 3. Male dogfish undertook normal DVM (nocturnal ascent) within relatively small home ranges (similar to 100 x 100 m) comprising along-bottom movements up submarine slopes from deeper, colder waters occupied during the day into warmer, shallow prey-rich areas above the thermocline at night. Few daytime vertical movements occurred. Levels of activity were higher during the night above the thermocline compared to below it during the day indicating they foraged in warm water and rested in colder depths. 4. A thermal choice experiment using environmentally realistic temperatures supported the field observation that dogfish positively avoided warmer water even when it was associated with greater food availability. Males in laboratory aquaria moved into warm water from a cooler refuge only to obtain food, and after food consumption they preferred to rest and digest in cooler water. 5. Modelling of energy budgets under different realistic thermal-choice scenarios indicated dogfish adopting a 'hunt warm - rest cool' strategy could lower daily energy costs by just over 4%. Our results provide the first clear evidence that are consistent with the hypothesis that a benthic marine-fish predator utilizes DVM as an energy conservation strategy that increases bioenergetic efficiency.",,,,,"Moore, Pippa/HCH-3738-2022; Hutchinson, Neil/I-2306-2012; SOUTHALL, EMILY J/AGP-5395-2022; Righton, David/D-6140-2013; Moore, Pippa/H-8079-2013","Hutchinson, Neil/0000-0002-8782-3493; SOUTHALL, EMILY J/0000-0001-7246-278X; Moore, Pippa/0000-0002-9889-2216; Sims, David/0000-0002-0916-7363; Righton, David/0000-0001-8643-3672",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,,,,,JAN,2006,75,1,,,,,176,190,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.01033.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.01033.x,,,,,,,,16903055,,,,,WOS:000235043700018,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Dundon, SG; Mayer, DG",,,,"Dundon, S. G.; Mayer, D. G.",,,Pen parameters for improving the performance of sheep imported from Australia to Persian Gulf feedlots,SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Summer in the Persian Gulf region presents physiological challenges for Australian sheep that are part of the live export supply chain coming from the Australian winter. Many feedlots throughout the Gulf have very high numbers of animals during June to August in order to cater for the increased demand for religious festivals. From an animal welfare perspective it is important to understand the necessary requirements of feed and water trough allowances, and the amount of pen space required, to cope with exposure to these types of climatic conditions. This study addresses parameters that are pertinent to the wellbeing of animals arriving in the Persian Gulf all year round. Three experiments were conducted in a feedlot in the Persian Gulf between March 2010 and February 2012, totalling 44 replicate pens each with 60 or 100 sheep. The applied treatments covered animal densities, feed-bunk lengths and water trough lengths. Weights, carcass attributes and health status were the key recorded variables. Weight change results showed superior performance for animal densities of >= 1.2 m(2)/head during hot conditions (24-h average temperatures greater than 33 degrees C, or a diurnal range of around 29-37 degrees C). However the space allowance for animals can be decreased, with no demonstrated detrimental effect, to 0.6 m(2)/head under milder conditions. A feed-bunk length of >= 5 cm/head is needed, as 2 cm/head showed significantly poorer animal performance. When feeding at 90% ad libitum 10 cm/head was optimal, however under a maintenance feeding regime (1 kg/head/day) 5 cm/head was adequate. A minimum water trough allowance of 1 cm/head is required. However, this experiment was conducted during milder conditions, and it may well be expected that larger water trough lengths would be needed in hotter conditions. Carcass weights were determined mainly by weights at feedlot entry and subsequent weight gains, while dressing percentage was not significantly affected by any of the applied treatments. There was no demonstrated effect of any of the treatments on the number of animals that died, or were classified as unwell. However, across all the treatments, these animals lost significantly more weight than the healthy animals, so the above recommendations, which are aimed at maintaining weight, should also be applicable for good animal health and welfare. Therefore, best practice guidelines for managing Australian sheep in Persian Gulf feedlots in the hottest months (June-August) which present the greatest environmental and physical challenge is to allow feed-bunk length 5 cm/head on a maintenance-feeding program and 10 cm/head for 90% ad libitum feeding, and,the space allowance per animal should be >= 1.2 m(2)/head. Water trough allocation should be at least 1 cm/head with provision for more in the summer when water intake potentially doubles. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J,"Topping, CJ; Sunderland, KD",,,,"Topping, CJ; Sunderland, KD",,,Population dynamics and dispersal of Lepthyphantes tenuis in an ephemeral habitat,ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,,,,,,,,,,,,"The population dynamics of Lepthyphantes tenuis (Blackwall) were investigated in two fields of winter wheat in Sussex, England, with the aim of attributing the major factors controlling population fluctuations. Continuous measures of changes in density, reproductive rate and dispersal were obtained using a range of methodologies, including laboratory analysis, suction trapping, rotary sampling of the aerial fauna, caging, and detailed density estimations. The resulting data were then used to determine the major causes of the observed population fluctuations and to describe the processes of dispersal and reproduction in this population. Population densities were initially very low following ploughing operations, but increased throughout the season as a result of high reproductive rates. Investigation of the reproductive potential of the spiders showed that the number of eggs per egg-sac did not vary with season, and that egg development was temperature related. There was no evidence that the number of viable eggs per egg-sac varied during the season. There were three peaks of hatchling production per year suggesting two to three generations of spiders. Dispersal was not responsible for the major changes in field density throughout the season although dispersal activity was high for this species. Dispersal activity increased with age and was highest in females. Dispersal activity as a ratio of activity/field density for females, males, sub-adults, immatures and hatchlings was 4:2:3:1:1. Aerial dispersal is only possible under suitable weather conditions. It was found that female dispersal was correlated with weather conditions far more strongly than other population groups. Calculations showed that under suitable weather conditions (e.g., 25% of the time being suitable for dispersal), almost 4% of the adult females could be expected to leave the population daily. The overall effect is therefore to displace individuals from the population but to have little effect on densities. Dispersal in other stages was controlled by the suitability of weather conditions but also by other, undetermined factors. It is postulated that L. tenuis has a life history strategy whereby suitable habitats act as sources of spiders, mainly females, which are continually involved in dispersal. Dispersal in other population groups may be triggered by factors such as the avoidance of adverse conditions. This type of life-history strategy is typical of organisms, such as weeds, that are successful in ephemeral habitats and may indicate that this species originally evolved in unpredictable habitats such as dry river beds or coastal areas.",,,,,"Topping, Christopher J/A-9167-2009","Topping, Christopher J/0000-0003-0874-7603; Topping, Christopher/0000-0003-2304-1916",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,,,,,APR,1998,87,1,,,,,29,41,,10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00301.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00301.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000073348800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The tropical estuarine calanoid copepod Acartia tropica is a potential live feed for finfish larviculture because of their higher fecundity and wide salinity tolerance. The present study was aimed at identifying the optimal salinity for obtaining maximum production of A. tropica nauplii. Population growth, intrinsic rate of population increase, egg production (eggs female(-1) day(-1)), egg hatching success (EHS) and nauplii survival (%) of A. tropica were assessed at different salinity levels. Similarly, the effect of long term acclimatization on population growth of A. tropica was also studied. The experimental salinity range was set to be 5-30 ppt based on the abrupt salinity change experiment. Highest mean population count (1265 +/- 209) and intrinsic rate of population increase (0.493 +/- 0.01) were recorded at 15 ppt which was significantly higher (p<0.05) than other salinity treatments except for 20 ppt (1005 +/- 129, 0.481 +/- 0.01). The lowest mean population count and intrinsic rate of population increase were recorded at 30 ppt (80.75 +/- 17.86, 0.32 +/- 0.003). The highest mean daily egg production was recorded at 15 ppt (33.42 +/- 5.88) which was significantly different (p<0.05) from all other treatments. Nauplii survival at 15 ppt (79.73 +/- 4.86) was significantly higher (p<0.05) except for 20 ppt (73.81 +/- 5.62). However different salinity conditions did not affect EHS and sex ratio of adults in the present study. Multigenerational acclimatization significantly improved the population growth and mean daily egg production of A. tropica at 30 ppt (558.30 +/- 35, 25.80 +/- 4.00). Hence the present study suggests that the salinity range of 15-20 ppt supports the maximum productivity of A. tropica and it can be well adapted to higher salinity conditions through multigenerational acclimatization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,,,JAN 30,2021,531,,,,,,,,735818,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735818,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735818,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000595051100015,View Full Record in Web of Science

By this method, daily passive SMC products from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission with 36-km resolution were disaggregated using a daily gridded meteorological data with nominal 4-km resolution. The original and downscaled SMCs were evaluated by comparing with in situ SMC obtained from three core validation sites and three sparse networks. The experiment was conducted in the central part of the U.S. from April 2015 to June 2018. Results demonstrated that the downscaled SMC maintained the dynamic range of original SMC product and energy was conserved. Furthermore, the downscaled SMC showed good agreement with and slightly outperformed the original SMC as compared with in situ SMC. The downscaling method is shown to capture higher resolution SMC spatial variability while preserving the quality of original SMC. However, because of the complexity of soil moisture-atmosphere interactions, the actual contributing domain of downscaled SMC may be greater than 4 km.

Open-top chambers (OTCs) were used in a passive heating experiment, and the performance of the plants in unmanipulated controls was correlated with climatic fluctuations among the years. Phenological, vegetative, and reproductive variables were measured. In both species phenological responses were controlled mainly by ambient air temperature. In the evergreen C. tetragona vegetative growth was controlled mainly by the influx of global solar radiation and was not temperature-dependent, whereas the opposite applied in the herbaceous R. nivalis. Vegetative growth in C. tetragona was rather stable among years as well as between treatments, whereas it was strongly influenced by annual climate in R. nivalis. Both species increased their reproductive success with increasing temperature, but R. nivalis was also radiation-dependent in this case, probably because of its green, photosynthetic nutlets. Ovule number in R. nivalis increased steadily in the experimentally heated plots during the study in response to the constant temperature amelioration above the ambient. At the community level, evergreen C. tetragona seems to have low competitive ability under warmer conditions.

Under the progressive soil drought, leaf CER was reduced by 30-35%, as compared to the conditions of sufficient water content, evidently due to a 3.7-fold drop in the transpiration conductivity as compared to the control plants. The apparent constant of Rubisco carboxylation and leaf respiration in the light were not affected by the drought period. The rate of leaf growth under the progressive drought was reduced by 64% as compared to the sufficient moisture conditions. Thus, under the progressive drought, the diminished stomatal conductivity reduced CO2 concentration inside the leaf and lowered carbon photosynthetic assimilation. Meanwhile, the leaf source activity considerably increased in spite of diminished photosynthesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1021-4437,1608-3407,,,,JUL-AUG,2004,51,4,,,,,508,512,,10.1023/B:RUPP.0000035744.46726.4f,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:RUPP.0000035744.46726.4f,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000223364700012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The threshold for R. ferrugineus was found to be in the range 12-14 degrees C with very low numbers of weevils being captured in December and January the only months in which the average daily temperature fell below 14 degrees C. Captures rates were highest in the months of April, May and June, which corresponds to the onset of warmer weather in Egypt.

The river seasonal hydrology is defined by a long winter frozen season and a snowmelt-driven spring flood pulse. Capabilities for accurate monitoring and forecasting of the annual spring freshet and river ice breakup (RIB) in the Yukon and other northern rivers is limited, but critical for understanding hydrologic processes related to snow, and for assessing flood-related risks to regional communities. We developed a regional snow phenology record using satellite passive microwave remote sensing to elucidate interactions between the timing of upland snowmelt and the downstream spring flood pulse and RIB in the Yukon. The seasonal snow metrics included annual Main Melt Onset Date (MMOD), Snowoff (SO) and Snowmelt Duration (SMD) derived from multifrequency (18.7 and 36.5 GHz) daily brightness temperatures and a physically-based Gradient Ratio Polarization (GRP) retrieval algorithm. The resulting snow phenology record extends over a 29-year period (1988-2016) with 6.25 km grid resolution. The MMOD retrievals showed good agreement with similar snow metrics derived from in situ weather station measurements of snowpack water equivalence (r = 0.48, bias = -3.63 days) and surface air temperatures (r = 0.69, bias = 1 day). The MMOD and SO impact on the spring freshet was investigated by comparing areal quantiles of the remotely sensed snow metrics with measured streamflow quantiles over selected sub-basins. The SO 50% quantile showed the strongest (p < 0.1) correspondence with the measured spring flood pulse at Stevens Village (r = 0.71) and Pilot (r = 0.63) river gaging stations, representing two major Yukon sub-basins. MMOD quantiles indicating 20% and 50% of a catchment under active snowmelt corresponded favorably with downstream RIB (r = 0.61) from 19 river observation stations spanning a range of Yukon sub-basins; these results also revealed a 14-27 day lag between MMOD and subsequent RIB.

In the U.S. Midwest, corn (Zea mays L.) stover removal combined with no-till practices may increase or decrease soil N2O emissions by influencing soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient dynamics, yet empirical evidence from long-term field experiments is inconsistent. We investigated the effects of residue management (residue retained or removed) and tillage (chisel-till or no-till) on cumulative soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, grain yield, and yield-scaled N2O emissions in a 3-year study initiated 10 years after treatment implementation in a long-term, continuous corn experiment in Illinois, United States. Crop yields were affected by treatment in only one of three study years, with the combination of residue removal and no-till reducing yields compared to both chisel-till treatments. Cumulative N2O emissions, soil inorganic N concentrations, and yield-scaled N2O emissions differed over the 3-year period and were significantly affected by tillage, with no response to residue management. In 2 years, no-till decreased cumulative N2O emissions and yield-scaled N2O emissions by an average of 64% and 60%, respectively. Correlations between daily N2O fluxes and soil moisture, temperature, and inorganic N concentrations suggested that the relative importance of these variables changed depending on year and treatment. While more research across a range of sites and management practices is needed, our findings support previous studies which have challenged IPCC methodology assumptions regarding the effects of residue removal on N2O emissions. We conclude there is inherent difficulty in predicting the impacts of residue removal due to the complexity of soil processes underlying N2O emissions coupled with inter-annual weather variability in this rainfed continuous corn system. Future efforts to evaluate the net greenhouse gas emissions of cellulosic biofuel production may benefit from accounting for this uncertainty.",,,,,"Villamil, María Bonita/AAX-6625-2020","Villamil, María Bonita/0000-0003-3559-8981; Pittelkow, Cameron/0000-0001-8654-9552",,,,,,,,,,,,,1757-1693,1757-1707,,,,DEC,2018,10,12,,,,,972,985,,10.1111/gcbb.12564,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12564,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000449495600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

They have been proposed in a number of fungal genera, including the basidiomycete genus Fomes. The main aim of this work was to test new methods for species delimitation in cryptic lineages of polypores, and to define useful characters for species identification.A detailed examination of a number of different Fomes strains that had been collected and isolated from different habitats in Italy and Austria confirmed the presence of distinct lineages in the Fomes fomentarius clade. Our zero hypothesis was that the Mediterranean strains growing on Quercus represent a species which can be delimited based on morphological and physiological characters when they are evaluated in statistically relevant numbers. This hypothesis was tested based on phylogenetic analysis of the rDNA ITS region, morphological characters of basidiomes and pure cultures, growth rates and optimum growth temperature experiments, mycelial confrontation tests, enzyme activity tests and volatile organic compound (VOC) production. The Mediterranean lineage can unambiguously be delimited from F. fomentarius. A syntype of an obscure and previously synonymized name, Polyporus inzengae, represents the Mediterranean lineage that we recognize as Fomes inzengae, a distinct species. The rDNA ITS region is useful for delimitation of Fomes species. Moreover, also a variety of morphological characters including hymenophore pore size, basidiospore size, and diameter of skeletal hyphae are useful delimiting characters. The ecology is also very important, because the plant host appears to be a central factor driving speciation. Physiological characters turned also out to be species-specific, e.g. daily mycelial growth rates or the temperature range of pure cultures.

During 1 year ( September 2000 - October 2001), in situ measurements were conducted over a 8 degrees square area centered on 18 degrees W, 42 degrees N. We present the synthesis of the physical data set collected during this experiment. To improve time and space coverages, these measurements are combined with satellite information from sea surface temperature and altimetry. Daily fields of temperature, salinity, and stream function are produced over a seasonal cycle with a simplified Kalman filter. We analyze the annual cycle of the upper layer. The 1 year mean circulation in the upper 400 m resembles the scheme proposed by Paillet and Mercier ( 1997). The meridional component of the flow carries cold water southward, thus contributing to cool the POMME area. The annual mean heat budget shows that this advection by the mean current nearly balances the warming by the surface heat fluxes. The mixed layer maximum depth is reached in March. It increases, in zonal averages, from 100 m south of 38 degrees N to more than 270 m north of 45 degrees N and, remarkably, is shaped by the mesoscale. The subpolar mode water formed in the north of the POMME area has a lower density (26.8 - 27.0) than the mode water formed in the years 1988 - 1990 that Paillet and Arhan ( 1996) found in the density range ( 27.0 - 27.1).

The results show that reaction temperature and stopped time were the major factors affecting the formation of PMB-CTAB. Silicate concentration up to 5000 times higher than that of orthophosphate would not interfere with the determination of orthophosphate. Using artificial seawater with salinity of 35 as a matrix under the optimized conditions, the standard curve shows a linear range between 3.2 and 48.5 nmol/L, and the recovery and the detection limit of the proposed method are 96.4% and 1.57 nmol/L, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) (n=8), which was determined daily for 8 days, was 4.52% for the artificial seawater at a concentration of 32.4 nmol/L orthophosphate. Two typical seawater samples were analyzed using both the proposed method and the MAGnesiurn hydroxide-Induced Coprecipitation (MAGIC) method. The results of the two methods show no significant difference using the t test. Compared to the MAGIC method, the proposed method has the advantage of being more sensitive, faster, sample saving and easy for on-line analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, the area is now experiencing degradation due to resource overuse. In an attempt to forecast grassland production and to sustain the ecosystem, we built a time-dependent simulation model of the ecosystem based on long-range weather forecasts (several weeks to several months). The model incorporated five state variables including aboveand belowground biomass, the amount of standing dead plant material, livestock (sheep) weight, and the amount of excrement per unit ground area. Within the model, solar light energy is fixed by grassland vegetation and flows through the other variables via a variety of organism-environment interactions. The model was written using a set of simultaneous differential equations and was numerically analyzed. The values of the time-dependent parameters controlling energy flow were determined based on data accumulated in experiments and field surveys executed at a grassland experimental station located in Xilingol, as well as by reference to related literature. We used daily meteorological data including air temperature and rainfall recorded at the Xilinhot Meteorological Observatory. Simulated results for several stocking densities coincided well with the data of aboveground plant biomass observed at the experimental station in 1990, 1993, and 1997. We obtained reasonable simulation results for five stocking densities, three air temperature patterns, and five rainfall patterns. When a month-long drought, which sometimes occurs in this area, was forecast by a local weather station, a decrease in grassland production was forecast by the model. Such forecasts will assist in the management of livestock, forage preservation, and grassland conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J,"WATSON, DM; BEATTIE, GAC",,,,"WATSON, DM; BEATTIE, GAC",,,EFFECT OF WEATHER STATION LOGGING INTERVAL ON THE PRECISION OF DEGREE-DAY ESTIMATES,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE,,,,,,,,,,,,"The relationship between data-logging intervals and degree-day estimates was examined to determine the longest interval giving equivalent information to estimates based on 12-min intervals and, so, the most efficient interval for estimation of degree-days. Emphasis was placed on users of inexpensive, unsophisticated loggers with short-term (<3-5 years) rather than long-term temperature-monitoring needs. The study was based on 3 years (1990-92) of 12-min, spot-measured temperature records from Somersby, New South Wales, obtained using a discrete mode datalogger. Longer log intervals were simulated in 2 ways. Firstly, the spot measures of temperature obtained at 12-min intervals were used to derive intervals of 36 min, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 h, by excluding 12-min readings not corresponding to these intervals. Essentially, the data derived are those that would have been obtained if the discrete mode logger was originally set to these intervals. Secondly, as a way of approximating data collected from a logger operating in continuous mode, temperature data recorded at 36 min, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h, were estimated by averaging 12-min temperature readings over these intervals. For both spot and averaged data, degree-days were estimated by integrating the area under the daily temperature curve using each of the log intervals as the time-step. Estimates were also based on each of 7 lower developmental thresholds ranging from 10 to 13 degrees C. Our analysis showed that estimates of degree-days using spot data and, to a lesser extent, averaged data were insensitive to changes in log interval and lower threshold. For both spot and averaged temperature data, intervals up to 6 h did not give significantly different daily degree-day estimates from those based on 12-min intervals. However, when degree-days were estimated using averaged data, there was a significant dependence between log interval and season: the sensitivity of degree-day estimates to changes in log interval was highest in winter and lowest in summer. This indicates that selection of the most efficient log interval was seasonally dependent: shorter intervals should be selected for data collection concentrated at the cooler times of the year than at the warmer times of the year. This also implies that selection of the most efficient log interval is dependent on geographic variations in climate. Precise estimates (<+/-5% difference from degree-days based on 12-min intervals) of degree-days based on averaged data were obtained at Somersby using 4-h log intervals in summer, autumn, and spring, and 2-h log intervals in winter. For degree-days accumulated over a full year, 2-h log intervals gave very precise estimates that differed by only 1-2 days from accumulated degree-days based on 12-min intervals, while 4-h intervals gave differences of about 4-8 days. For spot-measured estimates of degree-days, in contrast, no season x log interval effect was found. Consequently, there was no seasonal and, by implication, geographic dependency to log interval selection within the range of the data. Annual accumulated degree-day estimates based on 6-h log intervals differed by <8 days compared with those based on 12-min intervals. The annual accumulated difference was up to about 1 day for log intervals up to 3 h. We discuss how recommended log intervals may be modified depending on the aims of a study, its precision requirements, and as a result of seasonal and geographic variations in temperature regime. We examine why degree-day estimates are affected by log interval duration for spot and averaged data and consider the implications of our results for the application of the degree-day concept and interpretation of previous research. Ways of overcoming equipment limitations (small data storage capabilities, high data retrieval costs, low battery life) other than through manipulating logging intervals are examined. Finally, we argue that for the estimation of degree-days, operating a datalogger in discrete mode operation has considerable advantages over continuous mode operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0816-1089,,,,,,1995,35,6,,,,,795,805,,10.1071/EA9950795,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA9950795,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995TK39700016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Proper system design and the use of pressure-compensating emitters have important roles in irrigation uniformity and efficiency, which directly affect plant growth. This study evaluated the performance of four pressure-compensating and noncompensating emitters and the effects of these irrigation equipment on the yield of three okra [Abelmoschus esculentus] varieties cultivated in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Trials were performed in two seasons (Spring and Fall 2016), and tested four types of irrigation equipment (flow control drip tape, thin wall drip line, thin wall drip tape, and heavy wall drip line) and three varieties of okra ('Clemson Spineless 80', 'Clemson Spineless', and 'Chant'), arranged on a complete randomized block design with three replications. Irrigation was performed based on reference evapotranspiration and measured daily using an automated weather station. Soil moisture, electrical conductivity (EC), and soil temperature were monitored using capacitance sensors. The ability of the irrigation equipment to increase pressure was evaluated in the laboratory, in experimental modules using clean water, and while simulating three different slopes (leveled, uphill, and downhill). In the field trial, yield and leaf physiological parameters were influenced by season (P < 0.05) and the percentage of the marketable yield was influenced by variety (P < 0.05); however, fruit morphological parameters and soluble solids content were variety-dependent (P < 0.01). The pressure-compensating emitters maintained water flow within the range indicated by the manufacturers when used within the recommended pressure range. Distribution uniformity decreased over time for all equipment except the heavy wall drip line in Fall 2016. Irrigation equipment did not impact okra morphological attributes and yield, indicating that the same productivity can be successfully maintained while improving irrigation efficiency.

Studies of modelling combined with field experiments can provide essential information to investigate interactions between carbon and water cycles and climate. Here we present a first attempt to investigate the long-term climate controls on seasonal patterns and inter-annual variations in water and carbon exchanges in an arid-zone savanna-woodland ecosystem using a detailed mechanistic soil-plant-atmosphere model (SPA), driven by leaf area index (LAI) simulated by an ecohydrological model (WAVES) and observed climate data during 1981-2012. The SPA was tested against almost 3 years of eddy covariance flux measurements in terms of gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). The model was able to explain 80 and 71% of the variability of observed daily GPP and ET, respectively. Long-term simulations showed that carbon accumulation rates and ET ranged from 20.6 g C m(-2) mon(-1) in the late dry season to 45.8 g C m(-2) mon(-1) in the late wet season, respectively, primarily driven by seasonal variations in LAI and soil moisture. Large climate variations resulted in large seasonal variation in ecosystem water-use efficiency (eWUE). Simulated annual GPP varied between 146.4 and 604.7 g C m(-2) y(-1). Variations in annual ET coincided with that of GPP, ranging from 110.2 to 625.8 mm y(-1). Annual variations in GPP and ET were driven by the annual variations in precipitation and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) but not temperature.

This study focused on estimation of daily actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture in Yanco area including Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA) area and Kyeamba creek, using the SEBAL model applied to a remote sensing TERRA/MODIS, NOAA AVHRR 18 and Landsat 5 TM sensor during different satellite over pass days in National Airborne Field Experimentation (NAFE) campaign, lasted over 3 weeks (October 30 to November 21, 2006). All ground truth data for calibration of model was collected during the field campaign. Instruments like a thermal imager and a tri-spectral scanner was flown onboard a small environmental research aircraft at different altitudes together with coincident ground data collection on soil moisture, surface roughness, skin and soil temperature, and vegetation water content. Results showed that actual ET estimated from NOAA AVHRR 18 was always overestimating (range from 11.5% to 59.3%) as comparison to Eddy system (on average 37%) during the image acquisition dates. However, for the same image acquisition dates, TERRA/MODIS ET ranges from 9.8% lower to 14.3% higher than the Eddy system. Landsat 5 TM modeled ET results were comparable to the Eddy Covariance system having a minor error of -1.21%. Similarly, root zone soil moisture modeled results showed that soil moisture ranges from 0.3-0.7 degree of saturation for Yanco area and 0.3-0.5 degree of saturation for Kyeamba creek on November 14. The effect of rainfall on Nov. 12 was captured in soil moisture results because most of the pixels showing high degree of saturation. It was proven possible to simultaneously use SEBAL for different sensors with the combination of high spatial and temporal resolution to estimate ET spatial distribution characteristics; though the accuracy of NOAA-AVHRR derived result is not ideal. The Landsat ET results in this study match very well with the Eddy system. Considering the lack of high spatial resolution thermal satellite and need of time-series ET dynamics, the MODIS data could be used to provide seasonal actual ET for regional studies. The combination of MODIS and Landsat can be a better choice for future ET study at regional or catchment scale, but further study need to be conducted to integrate to provide both high spatial and temporal ET. Estimation of actual ET and soil moisture from TERRA MODIS in combination with Landsat imagery indicated relatively good accuracy and potential for use in the water balance and water productivity analysis at the catchment level. In future, the ET will be modeled from high resolution airborne data acquired during NAFE campaign over Yanco area and Kyeamba creek and the results will be compared with the optical satellite imagery results to find out uncertainty in up-down scaling modeling for ET estimation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,2611,2617,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290030702096,View Full Record in Web of Science

Potential limitations of all three approaches are recognized. Here we address the congruence among these three main approaches by comparing the degree to which tundra plant community composition changes (i) in response to in situ experimental warming, (ii) with interannual variability in summer temperature within sites, and (iii) over spatial gradients in summer temperature. We analyzed changes in plant community composition from repeat sampling (85 plant communities in 28 regions) and experimental warming studies (28 experiments in 14 regions) throughout arctic and alpine North America and Europe. Increases in the relative abundance of species with a warmer thermal niche were observed in response to warmer summer temperatures using all three methods; however, effect sizes were greater over broad-scale spatial gradients relative to either temporal variability in summer temperature within a site or summer temperature increases induced by experimental warming. The effect sizes for change over time within a site and with experimental warming were nearly identical. These results support the view that inferences based on space-for-time substitution overestimate the magnitude of responses to contemporary climate warming, because spatial gradients reflect long-term processes.

The biowindow was filled with biosolids compost amended with yard waste and leaf compost with the ratio of 4:1 as the substrate layer. Two years of monitoring of methane (CH4) oxidation in the biowindow led to remarkable expected observations including a thick, solid winter frost cover affecting gas exchange in winter and temperatures above 45 degrees C in the biowindow in late summer. A high influx compared to the reported values was observed into the biowindow with an average value of 1137 g.m(-2).d(-1), consisting of 64% of CH4 and 36% of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the landfill gas. The variations in the temperature and moisture content (MC) of the compost layer in addition to the influx fluctuations affected CH4 oxidation efficiency; however, a high average CH4 oxidation rate of 237 g.m(-2).d(-1) was obtained, with CH4 being mostly oxidized at top layers. The laboratory batch experiments verified that thermophilic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) were active throughout the study period and oxidized CH4 with a higher rate than mesophilic MOB. The methanotrophic potential of the compost mixture showed an average value of 282 mu mol.g(-1).d(-1) in the entire period of the study which is in the range of the highest reported maximum CH4 oxidation rates. The adopted compost mixture was suitable for CH4 oxidation if the MC was above 30%. The significance of MC variations on CH4 oxidation rate depended on the temperature range within the biowindow. At temperatures below 2 degrees C, between 29 and 31 degrees C, and above 45 degrees C, MC was not a controlling factor for mesophilic CH4 oxidation.",,,,,,"Yuan, Qiuyan/0000-0003-4309-2673",,,,,,,,,,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,APR,2022,29,17,,,,,24623,24638,,10.1007/s11356-021-17566-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17566-4,,NOV 2021,,,,,,34825333,,,,,WOS:000722552800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The current degree-day model for predicting a specified percentage of yearly moth flight involves heat unit accumulation above 10 degrees C after 1 May. However, because the moth's observed range has expanded into the northern and eastern United States, there is concern that suitable temperatures before May could allow for significant S. albicosta development. Daily blacklight moth catch and temperature data from four Nebraska locations were used to construct degree-day models using simple or sine-wave methods, starting dates between 1 January and 1 May, and lower (-5 to 15 degrees C) and upper (20 to 43.3 degrees C) developmental thresholds. Predicted dates of flight from these models were compared with observed flight dates using independent datasets to assess model performance. Model performance was assessed with the concordance correlation coefficient to concurrently evaluate precision and accuracy. The best model for predicting timing of S. albicosta flight used simple degree-day calculations beginning on 1 March, a 3.3 degrees C (38 degrees F) lower threshold, and a 23.9 degrees C (75 degrees F) upper threshold. The revised cumulative flight model indicated field scouting to estimate moth egg density at the time of 25% flight should begin when 1,432 degree-days (2,577 degree-days degrees F) have accumulated. These results underscore the importance of assessing multiple parameters in phenological models and utilizing appropriate assessment methods, which in this case may allow for improved timing of field scouting for S. albicosta.",,,,,"Moon, Roger/ABA-7225-2020; Hanson, Anthony/A-1324-2014","Hanson, Anthony/0000-0002-5539-0486; Hutchison, William D./0000-0001-9605-2996",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0493,1938-291X,,,,AUG,2015,108,4,,,,,1728,1738,,10.1093/jee/tov110,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/tov110,,,,,,,,26470314,,,,,WOS:000360626600031,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the past, we have developed such a model called ALOMYSYS for a single grass weed species. The objective of the present paper was to extend the monospecific emergence model to a multi-specific weed flora, by removing a few non-generic processes (e.g. maternal effects on dormancy and germination) and by adapting the germination sub-model to a larger diversity of species. The model is based on a daily simulation of weed seedbank mortality, seasonal dormancy variations, germination and pre-emergent growth until seedling emergence, in interaction with cropping systems and environmental conditions. In order to parameterize the model for numerous and contrasting species, we developed an innovative approach consisting in estimating 25 parameters from easily accessible species traits or from empirical expert knowledge. Relationships were established between seed traits (e.g. seed coat thickness, mass or shape) and seed mortality rates, dormancy levels, speed of germination as well as pre-emergent mortality. Base temperature for germination and dates of dormancy variations were related to usual dates of the species emergence in fields, obtained from expert knowledge. The generic model structure and the trait-parameter relationships make it possible to simulate a wide diversity of weed species and to predict their response to a large range of cropping systems. Thanks to a daily time-step and the integration of the interactions with soil and climatic conditions, FLORSYS permits to optimize the choice of cultural techniques for weed management, as a function of field characteristics and previous technical operations. For instance, the model was used to compare the emergence of different weed species depending on tillage, in interaction with the preceding technical operations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The biomass of both control and salinity-stressed plants grown at high temperatures (daily maximum of 37 degrees C) and an irradiance of 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was increased by up to 200% by enriched rhizosphere DIG. The growth rates of plants grown with irradiances of less than 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) were increased by elevated rhizosphere DIC concentrations only when grown at high shoot temperatures (35 degrees C) or with salinity (28 degrees C), At high light intensities, the photosynthetic rate, the CO2 and light-saturated photosynthetic rate (J(max)) and the stomatal conductance of plants grown at high light intensity were lower in plants supplied with enriched compared to ambient DIG. This was interpreted as 'down-regulation' of the photosynthetic system in plants supplied with elevated DIG. Labelled organic carbon in the xylem sap derived from root (DIC)-C-14 incorporation was found to be sufficient to deliver carbon to the shoot at rates equivalent to 1% and 10% of the photosynthetic rate of the plants supplied with ambient- and enriched-DIC, respectively.

By applying these models, the stability of products with characteristics within the investigated pH, a(w) and acetic acid ranges can be evaluated. Besides, the well-defined no growth regions can be used in the development of guidelines regarding formulation of new shelf-stable foods without using chemical preservatives, which would facilitate the innovation of additive-free products. Experiments were performed at different temperatures and periods (22 degrees C for 45 and 60 days, 30 degrees C for 45 days) in 150 modified Sabouraud media characterized by high amount of sugars (glucose and fructose, 15% (w/v)), acetic acid (0.0-2.5% (v/v), 6 levels), pH (3.0-5.0, 5 levels) and a(w) (0.93-0.97, 5 levels). These time and temperature combinations were chosen as they are commonly applied for shelf-stable foods. The media were inoculated with ca. 4.5 log CFU/ml and yeast growth was monitored daily using optical density measurements. Every condition was examined in 20 replicates in order to yield accurate growth probabilities. Three separate ordinary logistic regression models were developed for different tested temperatures and incubation time. The total acetic acid concentration was considered as variable for all models. In general, when one intrinsic inhibitory factor became more stringent, the G/NG boundary shifted to less stressful conditions of the other two factors, resulting in enlarged no growth zones. Abrupt changes of growth probability often occurred around the transition zones (between growth and no growth regions), which indicates that minor variations in environmental conditions near the G/NG boundaries can cause a significant impact oil the growth probability. When comparing growth after 45 days between the two tested temperatures, an unexpected phenomenon was observed: the no growth region at 30 degrees C was larger than the one at 22 degrees C, though it is known that 30 degrees C is the optimal growth temperature for Z bailii. These results show that lowering temperature does not always lead to a reduced growth of the yeast (i.e. more stable foods) and storing shelf-stable products at the higher temperature (30 degrees C) is not always the worst case. In addition, at 22 degrees C, there was no significant difference in no growth zones between the two incubation periods (45 and 60 days), implying that the no growth zones remain unchanged if the experimental time is Sufficiently long.

In this study, we investigated the individual and interactive effects of experimental warming (+3 degrees C above ambient summer daily range of 9-12 degrees C), supplemental precipitation (333 mm + 15%) and drought (333 mm -23%) on plant biomass, microbial biomass C (MBC), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and dissolved organic C (DOC) flux in soil cores from two upland grasslands of different soil nitrogen (N) status (0.54% and 0.37%) in the UK. After one month of acclimation to ambient summer temperature and precipitation, five replicate cores of each treatment were subjected to three months of experimental warming, drought and supplemental precipitation, based on the projected regional summer climate by the end of the 21st Century, in a fully factorial design. NEE and DOC flux were measured throughout the experimental duration, alongside other environmental variables including soil temperature and moisture. Plant biomass and MBC were determined at the end of the experiment. Results showed that warming plus drought resulted in a significant decline in below ground plant biomass (-29 to -37%), above ground plant biomass (-35 to -77%) and NEE (-13 to -29%), regardless of the N status of the soil. Supplemental precipitation could not reverse the negative effects of warming on the net ecosystem C uptake and plant biomass production. This was attributed to physiological stress imposed by warming which suggests that future summer climate will reduce the C sink capacity of the grasslands. Due to the low moisture retention observed in this study, and to verify our findings, it is recommended that future experiments aimed at measuring soil C dynamics under climate change should be carried out under field conditions. Longer term experiments are recommended to account for seasonal and annual variability, and adaptive changes in biota. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the changes in cultivation patterns and climate suitability of spring maize in Inner Mongolia from 1959 to 2018. We used the daily meteorological data from 50 weather stations and growth period data of spring maize from nine agrometeorological stations. In addition, the quantitative and interdecadal relationship between climate suitability of regions and climate-induced crop yield was analyzed using stepwise regression and cross wavelet transform. The results show that: (1) The planting boundaries of different spring maize maturity types extend to the north and east. In the middle part, early maturity maize has been replaced by medium maturity maize. The unsuitable planting areas in Northeast Inner Mongolia are decreasing, and the early maturity areas are increasing. (2) The climate suitability for spring maize planting areas is increasing. However, variations occur between different regions; the eastern region has the highest climate suitability (S-z = 0.67), but the overall trend is decreasing in this region. Whereas the central region has moderate suitability (S-z = 0.62), with a significantly increasing trend (p < 0.05). The western region is lower (S-z = 0.60) and the trend is not significant. (3) Climate suitability and climate-induced yields are generally positively correlated. The primary factors affecting climate-induced yields are sunshine hours, followed by climate suitability, rainfall, and temperature. The cross-wavelet transform shows that climate suitability and climate-induced yield have greater periodicity in the late growth period. Appropriate expansion of the planting range of medium-late maturity spring maize can fully adapt to the impact of climate warming.

We collected 78 remote underwater stereo-video samples during four storms. The relative abundance and species richness of fishes were compared to environmental data (significant wave height, water motion, temperature, light intensity and mean surface level pressure) collected during each storm. As wave height and water motion increased, there was a general decline in abundance of fishes and species richness within the assemblage. The variation in the total number of individual fishes was best explained by a combination of water motion, mean surface level pressure, and temperature. Species richness decreased at the height of the storms, and was best explained by significant wave height and mean surface level pressure. Certain fish species were observed to be highly sensitive to fluctuations in different environmental variables, while others proved more resilient to the changing conditions. Sensitive species such as Austrolabrus maculatus disappeared from the recorded assemblage when wave height reached similar to 3 m. In contrast, more resilient species such as Parma mccullochi persisted until the occurrence of more severe conditions (wave height > 5 m). In addition to wave height and water motion, temperature, light intensity and mean surface level pressure all contribute to models explaining variation in the abundance of fish species during these storm events. We suggest that environmental changes during storm events have an influence on the behaviour of fishes depending on their morphological and physiological characteristics, and that sensitive species may migrate from the area or seek refuge in the reef substrate to weather the storm. Our results suggest that it may be important to consider meteorological conditions when conducting fish surveys, and further work should examine the susceptibility of different species to rapid changes in environmental conditions.

Thus, there is an increased interest in understanding the effects of changes in means and variances of temperature on traits of climatic stress resistance. Here, we examined short-term (within-generation) variation in mean temperature (23, 25, and 27 degrees C) at three levels of diel thermal fluctuations (delta = 1, 3, or 5 degrees C) on an invasive pest insect, the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Using the adult flies, we address the hypothesis that temperature variability may affect the climatic stress resistance over and above changes in mean temperature at constant variability levels. We scored the traits of high- and low-thermal tolerance, high- and low-temperature acute hardening ability, water balance, and egg production under benign conditions after exposure to each of the nine experimental scenarios. Most importantly, results showed that temperature variance may have significant effects in addition to the changes in mean temperature for most traits scored. Although typical acclimation responses were detected for most of the traits under low variance conditions, high variance scenarios dramatically altered the outcomes, with poorer climatic stress resistance detected in some, but not all, traits. These results suggest that large temperature fluctuations might limit plastic responses which in turn could reduce the insect fitness. Increased mean temperatures in conjunction with increased temperature variability may therefore have stronger negative effects on this agricultural pest than elevated temperatures alone. The results of this study therefore have significant implications for understanding insect responses to climate change and suggest that analyses or simulations of only mean temperature variation may be inappropriate for predicting population-level responses under future climate change scenarios despite their widespread use.",,,,,"Terblanche, John/AAB-4457-2020","Terblanche, John/0000-0001-9665-9405",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,1570-7458,,,,DEC,2010,137,3,,,,,304,315,,10.1111/j.1570-7458.2010.01067.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2010.01067.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000284171700012,View Full Record in Web of Science

A variety of conditions were encountered, with a concomitant range of trophic states, from pre-bloom low chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) < 3 mu g l(-1) during heavy ice cover to late spring open water diatom blooms with Chl-a up to 40 mu g l(-1). Microzooplankton biomass was dominated by large heterotrophic dinoflagellates and ciliates. Both athecate and thecate dinoflagellates, as well as some species of ciliates, fed on diatom cells and chains. Other types of protists, notably thecate amoebae and parasitoid flagellates, were also observed preying on diatoms. Total microzooplankton biomass ranged from 0.1 to 109 mu g C l(-1) and was positively related to Chl-a concentration. Significant rates of microzooplankton herbivory were found in 55% of dilution experiments. Maximum grazing rate was 0.49 d(-1), and average grazing rate, including experiments with no significant grazing, was 0.09 +/- 0.10 d(-1). Phytoplankton intrinsic growth rates varied from slightly negative growth to > 0.4 d(-1). Microzooplankton grazing was significant in both non-bloom and bloom conditions, averaging 46 +/- 75% of phytoplankton daily growth. Based on the amount of phytoplankton carbon consumed, we estimated potential microzooplankton community growth rates of up to 1.3 d(-1). Our results confirm the importance of protist grazers in planktonic food webs of high latitude ecosystems. We also conclude that our finding of significant grazing by microzooplankton on spring blooms in the Bering Sea does not support theories about phytoplankton bloom formation based on escape from grazing, due either to predation resistance or to slow growth of herbivorous protists at cold temperature.

S.",,,Environmental fluctuations facilitate species co-existence and increase decomposition in communities of wood decay fungi,OECOLOGIA,,,,,,,,,,,,"A fluctuating environment may facilitate co-existence of species, and high species richness may be important for maintaining ecosystem processes under changing environmental conditions. A positive relationship has been found between species richness and primary production in many experiments, and there is now an increasing interest whether similar relationships also apply to microorganisms and decomposition. Basidiomycete fungi are the primary decomposers of wood with the functional groups brown and white rot fungi, which differ with respect to decay strategy. In this study, 16 species of boreal wood decay fungi, 8 brown rot fungi and 8 white rot fungi, were assembled in artificial communities. The aims were to study species persistence, wood decomposition and metabolic efficiency in fungal communities of increasing levels of species richness under constant and fluctuating temperature regimes. Species persistence was generally low, but temperature fluctuations facilitated co-existence of species. Decomposition was highest at intermediate diversity levels under the fluctuating temperature regime. Metabolic efficiency, estimated as the amount of fungal mycelium formed per amount of degraded wood, decreased with increasing community complexity under the fluctuating temperature regime. Brown and white rot fungi differed in decomposition rates and metabolic efficiency, but no synergistic effects were found where the two functional groups were mixed. This study demonstrates how niche differentiation in a variable environment may act to maintain diversity and function. In our experiment, differences in functional responses to the varying temperature rather than resource partitioning between brown and white rot fungi had significant effects. Niche differentiation is likely to be particularly important in maintaining species diversity in communities of wood decaying fungi, which are known from previous studies to be characterised by intense competition, and where otherwise metabolically costly interactions lead to species exclusion and dominance by highly competitive species.",,,,,"Holmer, Lars/N-7736-2019; Lindahl, Björn D./AAH-4538-2019; Toljander, Ylva/ABE-1719-2020","Holmer, Lars/0000-0003-3629-0049; Toljander, Ylva/0000-0002-6338-3294",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,JUL,2006,148,4,,,,,625,631,,10.1007/s00442-006-0406-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0406-3,,,,,,,,16538482,,,,,WOS:000238533400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The influence of different quantities of straw mulch on soil water evaporation during the thawing period was analyzed using the Mallat algorithm, statistical analysis and information cost function. The results showed that straw mulching could delay the thawing of the surface soil by 3-6 d, decrease the speed at which the surface soil thaws by 0.40-0.80 cm/d, delay the peak soil liquid water content, increase the soil liquid water content, reduce the cumulative evaporation by 2.70-7.40 mm in the thawing period, increase the range of soil evaporation by 0.04-0.10 mm in the early stage of the thawing period, and reduce the range of soil evaporation by 0.25-0.90 mm in the late stage of the thawing period.

A throughfall exclusion (TFE) experiment was conducted in a continental climate coniferous stand in Gangwon Province, Korea, to examine the effects of excluding rainfall on total soil respiration (SR), heterotrophic soil respiration (HR), autotrophic soil respiration (AR), sapling diameter growth, and soil bacterial communities from July 2016 to October 2017. The soil water content (SWC) was significantly decreased by the exclusion of the throughfall, resulting in changes in the bacterial communities, and subsequently a decrease in HR. Although AR did not present significant differences between the control and TFE plots, the rate of sapling growth was significantly lower in the TFE plots compared with that in the control plots. An exponential function relating SR to soil temperature accounted for 0.61% and 0.82% of the variance in SR in the control and TFE plots, respectively (Q(10)= 2.48 and 2.86, respectively). Furthermore, a multivariate nonlinear model based on soil temperature and SWC explained 0.89% and 0.88% of the variance in SR in the control and TFE plots, respectively. When soil temperature was high, SR showed high fluctuations due to SWC variation. However, when SWC was low, we detected relatively small fluctuations in SR due to soil temperature.

The goal of the observations was to quantify the water column variability in order to understand the along- and across-shore low-frequency acoustic propagation in shallow water. The moorings were deployed from April 21-May 19,2001 and sampled at 1-5 min intervals to capture the full range of temporal variability without aliasing the internal wave field. The dominant oceanographic signal by far was in fact the highly nonlinear internal waves (or solitons) which were generated near the Batan Islands in the Luzon Strait and propagated 485 km across deep water to the observation region. Dubbed trans-basin waves, to distinguish them from other, smaller nonlinear waves generated locally near the shelf break, these waves had amplitudes ranging from 24 to greater than 140 m and were among the largest such waves ever observed in the world's oceans. The waves arrived at the most offshore mooring in two clusters lasting 7-8 days each separated by five days when no waves were observed. Within each cluster, two types of waves arrived which have been named type-a and type-b. The type-a waves had greater amplitude than the type-b waves and arrived with remarkable regularity at the same time each day, 24 h apart. The type-b waves were weaker than the type-a waves, arrived an hour later each day, and generally consisted of a single soliton growing out of the center of the wave packet. Comparison with modeled barotropic tides from the generation region revealed that: 1) The two clusters were generated around the time of the spring tides in the Luzon strait; and 2) The type-a waves were generated on the strong side of the diurnal inequality while the type-b waves were generated on the weaker beat. The position of the Kuroshio intrusion into the Luzon Strait may modulate the strength of the waves being produced. As the waves shoaled, the huge lead solitons first split into two solitons then merged together into a broad region of thermocline depression at depths less than 120 m. Elevation waves sprang up behind them as they continued to propagate onshore. The elevation waves also grew out of regions where the locally-generated internal tide forced the main thermocline down near the bottom. The critical point alpha where the upper and lower layers were equal was a good indicator of when the depression or elevation waves would form. however this was not a static point. but rather varied in both space and time according to the presence or absence of the internal tides and the incoming trans-basin waves themselves.",,,,,"Duda, Timothy F/A-7282-2010","Duda, Timothy F/0000-0002-5797-5955; Yang, Yiing-Jang/0000-0002-6637-9311",,,,,,,,,,,,,0364-9059,1558-1691,,,,OCT,2004,29,4,,,,,1157,1181,,10.1109/JOE.2004.840839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2004.840839,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000226732700024,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of the present trial was to study the influence of feeding strategies combining outdoor and indoor rearing on pig meat quality. The experiment was carried out with 245 pigs in 5 replicates, and commenced following weaning at day 52. Five treatments were compared: 1) pigs fed ad libitum and reared indoors with access to an outdoor concrete area (In-A); 2) pigs fed restrictively on pasture until 40 kg body weight and then kept indoors with access to an outdoor concrete area and fed ad libitum until slaughter (In-40A); 3) pigs fed restrictively on pasture until 80 kg body weight and then kept indoors with access to an outdoor concrete area and fed ad libitum until slaughter (In-80A); 4) pigs reared on pasture and fed restrictively during the whole period of growth (Out-R); and 5) pigs reared on pasture and fed ad libitum during the whole period of growth (Out-A). All pigs had free access to roughage (clover-grass silage/fresh clover grass). Restrictive feeding in the weight range from weaning to 40 kg body weight (In-40A) resulted in a reduced daily gain; however, following transfer to indoor facilities and ad libitum feeding these pigs compensated in growth and the overall daily gain did not differ from the In-A control pigs. Pigs fed restrictively from weaning to 80 kg body weight were unable to compensate completely following transfer to indoor facilities. Out-R pigs had the lowest overall daily gain, while In-A pigs and Out-A pigs had similar daily gain. Meat quality assessments were performed on longissimus dorsi (LD) samples from a subsample of 100 pigs (2 castrates and 2 female pigs from each treatment in each replicate). Compared to meat from either ad libitum treatments (In-A and Out-A), meat from Out-R and In-80A pigs was less red due to a lower pigmentation, and had a higher ratio of polyunsaturated: saturated fatty acids. In addition, Out-R female pigs had numerically (6-10 Newton) higher shear force than In-A and Out-A. Treatments did not affect the concentration of alpha-tocopherol of meat. Introducing a finishing period with free access to concentrates following 40 kg body weight until slaughter prevented the deterioration in meat quality. However, a finishing period following 80 kg body weight was not sufficient. In conclusion, ad libitum feeding in the organic production system gave superior meat quality compared to a restrictive feeding strategy. However, including a finishing period indoors with ad libitum feeding of concentrates may prevent the detrimental effect of restrictive feeding on meat quality.",,,,,"Hermansen, John Erik/G-9511-2013; Hermansen, John e/F-2247-2016","Hermansen, John e/0000-0003-0179-2647",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-4702,1651-1972,,,,DEC,2005,55,2-3,,,,,106,112,,10.1080/09064700510009324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064700510009324,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000233906100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

During each period, each group was given access to a 160 m 2 field for 4 h per day, over a period of five consecutive days. The treatments were different 4 M rooting areas in a field and included either ploughed dry soil (D), ploughed wet soil (W), dry soil with 400 g wheat and barley seeds (S) or no rooting area (N). At the start of each period, new areas were fenced off and groups were allocated to a new treatment. Pig behaviour was scan sampled at 5 min intervals over the 4 h access periods, temperature was recorded daily and pasture damage was assessed at the end of each period. The study was conducted during the summer months, with air temperature during observations ranging from 20 to 25 degrees C. During the first 15 min at pasture, the sows spent 70% of their time grazing, gradually reducing it to 20% during the final hour. Increased ambient temperature resulted in less grazing and more lying and rooting behaviour. Approximately 23% of the total time was spent in the rooting area (if present), with no difference between treatments. Of all lying behaviour, 40% was performed in a rooting area. Only for W was the use of rooting area positively correlated with temperature (P < 0.05). Pasture damage was significantly influenced by treatment (damaged area: 15.3, 14.4, 6.8 and 4.7 m(2) for N, S, D and W, respectively; S.E.D. = 1.38, F-3,F-17 = 6.76, P < 0.01). It appeared that rooting of pasture was performed to create a cool lying area. S sows searched for food in the rooting area, and this activity forced pen mates to lie outside the rooting area. This may have resulted in the higher level of pasture damage for S compared to D and W. Offering a cool lying place and wallowing opportunities in a designated area reduced pasture damage, but offering foraging opportunities in a restricted area did not. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J. 2013. Combined use of two biocontrol agents with different biocontrol mechanisms most likely results in less than expected efficacy in controlling foliar pathogens under fluctuating conditions: A modeling study. Phytopathology 103:108-116. Effective use of biocontrol agents (BCAs) is a potentially important component of sustainable agriculture; recently, there has been a trend for combined use of several BCAs, with an expectation of synergistic interactions among them. A previous numerical study suggested that, under homogenous conditions in which two BCAs occupied the same host tissue as the pathogen, combined use of two BCAs with different biocontrol mechanisms resulted, in most cases, in efficacies similar to using the more efficacious one alone; this result is consistent with published experimental results. The present study investigates whether combined use of a mycoparasitic and a competitive BCA leads to greater efficacy than that expected when the model is modified to allow for fluctuating temperature regimes and the effects of temperature on the pathogen and BCAs. Within the range of parameter values considered, combined use of two BCAs is shown to be less effective than that expected under the assumption of Bliss independence, and to result in a level of efficacy similar to that achieved by the more efficacious component used alone, indicating antagonistic interactions between the two BCAs. Nevertheless, combined use of two BCAs resulted in a slightly longer delay in epidemic development than did individual use of BCAs. Stochastic variability in simulated hourly temperatures did not result in a high level of variability in efficacy among replicates; nevertheless, the among-replicate variability appeared to be greater for the combined use of BCAs than for individual BCAs used alone. In contrast, there were greater effects of varying BCA temperature relationships and application time (reflected in the temperature profile) on efficacy, suggesting the importance of characterizing the relationship between BCA activity and environmental conditions in future research.",,,,,"Xu, Xiangming/I-3050-2014","Xu, Xiangming/0000-0002-4567-7117",,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-949X,1943-7684,,,,FEB,2013,103,2,,,,,108,116,,10.1094/PHYTO-07-12-0167-R,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-07-12-0167-R,,,,,,,,23095466,,,,,WOS:000313768400001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Burton, T; Lakka, HK; Einum, S",,,,"Burton, Tim; Lakka, Hanna-Kaisa; Einum, Sigurd",,,Measuring phenotypes in fluctuating environments,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite considerable theoretical interest in how the evolution of phenotypic plasticity should be shaped by environmental variability and stochasticity, how individuals actually respond to these aspects of the environment within their own lifetimes remains unclear. We propose that this understanding has been hampered by experimental approaches that expose organisms to fluctuating environments (typically treatments where fluctuations in the environment are cyclical vs. erratic) for a pre-determined duration while ensuring that the mean environment over that the entire exposure period is invariable. This approach implicitly assumes that responses to the mean and variance/predictability in the environment occur over the same time-scale. If this assumption is false, one potential outcome is that phenotypic differences among the treatment groups might arise in response to differences in the mean environment that are present over shorter time periods among those same treatment groups. We illustrate an experimental design that (a) creates variation in the level of environmental predictability, (b) allows for estimation of the time-scale over which the phenotypic response to the mean environment occurs and (c) permits statistical estimation of the effect of predictability in the environmental variable of interest while controlling for any effect of the mean environment over the relevant temporal scale. Using the clonally reproducing zooplankton species Daphnia magna, we test for within-generation plasticity in the ability to tolerate high temperature following exposure to multiple temperature treatments with the same overall mean, but where the pattern of fluctuations differed among them. This approach revealed that heat tolerance in Daphnia was not influenced by variability in temperature per se nor the predictability of fluctuations in temperature but adjusted in response to the mean temperature they experienced 24 hr prior to measurement.

In this article, the brightness temperature (TB) models of the sea background and the ship on the sea are established. Given the TB models, a ship detection and tracking algorithm with four steps is proposed, which is devoted to ship tracking. In addition, the impacts of the noises in the passive interferometric microwave images (PIMI) and the algorithm parameters are analyzed and discussed. Numerical simulations and airborne experiments are performed to assess the practicability of the algorithm. Both numerical and experimental results have demonstrated the practicability of the proposed algorithm with dealing with the additional systematic errors and estimating the ship heading, and the results also exhibit that the additional noises in the PIMI caused by the stochastic fluctuations of the aircraft and the algorithm parameters have a non-negligible impact on the algorithm detection performance. As a result, the ship-free observed TB maps should be carefully considered as the sea background TB map to improve the algorithm detection performance by reducing the noises caused by the stochastic fluctuations of the aircraft. In addition, the algorithm parameter should also be carefully considered to get a high ship detection probability with a low ship false-alarm rate.",,,,,,"Lu, Hailiang/0000-0001-8573-3489; Zhu, Dong/0000-0001-6423-5050",,,,,,,,,,,,,1939-1404,2151-1535,,,,,2021,14,,,,,,3519,3532,,10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3066514,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3066514,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000638400600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

All experiments were carried out at a constant temperature of 21 +/- 2 degrees C, a 16-h photoperiod and ambient RH. Pseudaphycus maculipennis was shown to be an arrhenotokous, synovigenic, gregarious endoparasitoid of Pseudococcus viburni. Females and males lived for 16 and 11 days, respectively, when fed either honey-agar or mealybug honeydew. Relatively, large instars (third instar or adult females) were preferred for oviposition; mated females parasitized more mealybugs than unmated females, and the progeny sex ratio favored females by 3:1. Egg load increased with age from emergence to day 8, averaging 23 mature eggs/female. Mean realised daily fecundity never exceeded 5, with a mean lifetime fecundity of 46 eggs/female. Parasitised mealybugs remained alive for about 5 days and then mummified. Total development period was 20-21 days (larva 4-5 days, prepupa 3 days, pupa 8-9 days). Development periods of eggs and individual larval instars were not measured. A mean of 3.01 +/- 0.1 parasitoids/mealybug were reared after individual parasitism events, increasing through super-parasitism (either self or conspecific) to 9 parasitoids/mealybug when hosts were exposed to competing females.

In this study, an adapted version of the modified dilution method was applied to simultaneously estimate the impact of both virus and nanoflagellate grazing on the mortality of heterotrophic bacteria. A series of experiments was conducted monthly from April to December 2011 and April to October 2012. The growth rates of bacteria we measured ranged from 0.078 h(-1) (April 2011) to 0.42 h(-1) (September 2011), indicating that temperature can be important in controlling the seasonal variations of bacterial growth. Furthermore, it appeared that seasonal changes in nanoflagellate grazing and viral lysis could account for 34% to 68% and 13% to 138% of the daily removal of bacterial production, respectively. We suggest that nanoflagellate grazing might play a key role in controlling bacterial biomass and might exceed the impact of viral lysis during the summer period (July to August) because of the higher abundance of nanoflagellates at that time. Viral lysis, on the other hand, was identified as the main cause of bacterial mortality between September and December. Based on these findings in this study, the seasonal variations in bacterial abundance we observed can be explained by a scenario in which both growth rates and loss rates (grazing + viral lysis) influence the dynamics of the bacteria community.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2013,10,5,,,,,3055,3065,,10.5194/bg-10-3055-2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-10-3055-2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000319838200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results from cell-cycle analysis of muscle cell nuclei of laboratory-reared Walleye Pollock larvae measured with flow cytometry were used as covariates in a generalized additive model to predict the growth rate (growth in length per day, mm d(-1)) of individual larvae from the day exogenous feeding began (first feeding) to the time of capture (r(2) = 0.79). Additional covariates used were temperature and standard length. A generalized additive model to classify a larva as fast- or slow-growing was also formulated using the same covariates. Validation testing with an independent set of 45 laboratory-reared larvae showed that 33% of the laboratory growth rates (i.e., growth rate based on age and size) fell within the 95% confidence interval of the predicted growth rates, and predicted growth rates were significantly less than otolith-derived growth rates. The growth classification model was more accurate than the growth rate model, correctly classifying the growth rate type (fast or slow growing) of 71% of the same set of larvae showing that flow cytometric cell cycle analysis may be better suited for classifying larvae as fast- or slow-growing rather than for predicting absolute growth rate. Predicted growth rates for larvae <= 11 mm in length collected from the Gulf of Alaska were within the range of published values for that area, and were not significantly different than corresponding otolith-derived growth rates. The growth rates of Gulf of Alaska larvae > 11 mm were overestimated when compared to both otolith-derived growth rates and published values, and that may be due in part because those larvae were outside of the size range used to formulate the model. Predicted growth rate and growth classification of late-stage, field-collected Walleye Pollock larvae would be improved by adding larvae as large as 15 mm to the model to encompass the size range of larvae typically collected during spring ichthyoplankton surveys conducted in the Bering Sea or Gulf of Alaska. Flow cytometric cell cycle analysis offers promise as an alternative method for determining growth rate of fish larvae when otolith daily increments cannot be reliably counted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,SEP,2019,518,,,,,,,,151178,10.1016/j.jembe.2019.151178,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2019.151178,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000480378700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Investigated drugs were stored in two different stores. The first one (A) is equipped with controlled temperature and humidity control systems. The second one (B) was a veterinary pharmacy selected randomly from East Nile locality. The temperature and humidity in the stores A and B were monitored and recorded daily using hygrometer for I year. At the beginning of the study all products were proved to be compatible with the recommendations of the manufacturers. There was no change in the colour of albendazole during the nine months at both stores. The pH values in the first store expressed noticeable reduction, although it is still within the recommended range. Following nine months storage the drug content of albendazole was reduced below the recommended level. In the second store (B), there was no change in the colour of both albendazole products tested. There was considerable change in pH value during the nine months storage, but still it is within the recommended level. The active pharmaceutical ingredient concentration (assay %), of albendazole fell below the recommended level (USP) following storage for nine months. In the first store (A), the two oxytetracycline products expressed no change in colour and there was slight reduction in pH level (but still within the recommended level) within the six months storage period. The experiment was terminated just after six months due to the reduction of the active ingredient concentration (assay %) below the recommended level. In the second store (B), there is only change in the colour in one of the products following six months storage. pH level also here expressed moderate reduction, but still in the recommended range. The concentration (assay %), of oxytetracycline expressed prominent reduction following storage for six months. The obtained results are of interest for stability studies and/or quality control purposes of Albendazole and Oxytetracycline commercial products.

Model evaluations usually involve bivariate linear regression between observed and simulated values, which assumes statistical independence among observed values. However, observed data often have dependencies if they originate from series of experiments or involve experiments using nested designs (e.g., with split plots). By representing experiments, cultivars, or other variables as factors, linear regression models can specify expected dependencies, permitting analyses that are statistically more rigorous and provide more insights into model performance. This study evaluated the Cropping System Model (CSM)-CROPGRO-Soybean model using regressions that included environment and cultivars as factors as well as continuous variables such as temperature or daylength. When applied to 28 data sets for soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.], representing 113 treatment combinations, the regressions showed that the model simulated days to anthesis and grain yield well for a wide range of environments. Differences among environments represented a larger portion of unexplained variation than did differences among cultivars. Further improvements thus might be sought in modeling crop response to environment rather than in representing cultivar differences, or alternatively, in characterizing soil profiles or daily weather rather than cultivars. A submodel for photosynthesis that scaled leaf-level values to canopy simulated grain yield more accurately than a simpler submodel. Multiple regressions provided much more information on model performance than simple bivariate comparisons.",,,,,"Hoogenboom, Gerrit/F-3946-2010","Hoogenboom, Gerrit/0000-0002-1555-0537; Boote, Kenneth/0000-0002-1358-5496",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-1962,1435-0645,,,,MAR-APR,2007,99,2,,,,,419,427,,10.2134/agronj2006.0100,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2006.0100,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000245290000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, several features can render it of little merit. These include the inability of artificial macropores effectively to harvest coalescing water on the soil surface, and the increased evaporation caused by the greater surface area of subsoil exposed to the atmosphere in such pores. To ascertain the extent of these effects I used a sprinkling infiltrometer to determine the time-to-ponding of small areas of perforated and unperforated soil subjected to different intensities of 'rain', and determined the rate of evaporation on perforated and unperforated microlysimeters. On average the perforated plots tended to take longer to pond than the unperforated ones, but the water-harvesting efficacy of individual artificial macropores was highly variable, depending on their position in the microlandscape, the degree of connectivity with subsoil pores, the rate at which the water was applied, and the antecedent water content of the topsoil. The microlysimeter experiments revealed consistently greater evaporation from the perforated samples, with average daily differences between the treatments ranging from 2 to 26%. Antecedent soil water content and air temperature and windspeed affected the amounts of evaporation from both treatments. The ultimate efficacy of perforation for capturing water will vary spatially and temporally according to the extent to which the properties of the soil and environment impact on the behaviour of the penetrating water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1351-0754,1365-2389,,,,SEP,1999,50,3,,,,,481,487,,10.1046/j.1365-2389.1999.00250.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2389.1999.00250.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082644400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

One possibility to resolve this issue is to create localized refugia of colder water generated through active cooling. The current work focuses on a prototype thermal refugia design and field testing. Various configurations of the prototype thermal refugia were tested in a stream, which could benefit from additional refugia regions. The prototypes featured a staggered, tube-bundle heat exchanger placed inside an enclosure with an aperture. The results demonstrate that in remote locations, man-made refugia can be provided. While the base enclosure (91.5 cm x 91.5 cm x 45.8 cm) allowed for excess mixing with the warmer free stream and resulted in low performance (dimensionless temperature difference of (theta) over bar (avg) = 0.07), additional modifications improved performance. By utilizing a panel or an extension, the dimensionless temperature difference quadrupled ((theta) over bar (avg) = 0.26) while the average heat transfer per dimensionless temperature difference was reduced to approximately one-fifth (1.92 kW(th)/(theta) over bar (avg)) of the base enclosure. But these configurations increased the standard deviation of the temperature differences inside the refugia due to localized cooling. The combination of the panel and the extension did not further increase the standard deviation but resulted in an even higher dimensionless temperature difference ((theta) over bar (avg) = 0.55) and a lower heat transfer per dimensionless temperature difference (0.81 kW/(theta) over bar (avg)). This suggests that the enclosure design can be used to achieve a desirable temperature differential while maintaining a reasonable spatial fluctuation in that temperature difference and power requirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,AUG,2022,15,15,,,,,,,5648,10.3390/en15155648,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15155648,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000839768400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Midday transpiration rates (T(r)) were measured in two experiments. The plants were grown in 75-1 containers. Drying the soil reduced E1 after 10 days and 2 days in the warm weather of the first two experiments (8-10 mm day-1 evaporation) and after 25 days in the cooler weather of the third experiment (3-4 mm day-1 evaporation). The N/D ratio was unchanged (P = 0.05) by soil drying. The relationship between E1 and PSI(s) was exponential while that between T(r) and PSI(s) was linear over the range - 50 to - 10 kPa. While a change in PSI(s) of 40.3 +/- 1.5 kPa reduced T(r) by 50%, a change of 21.2 +/- 0.4 kPa reduced E1 by 50%. Hence, E1 is a sensitive measure of the banana plant's response to water deficit.

P. decussata was associated only with clade C zooxanthellae (at all sampling times) while genotypic clade composition fluctuated in P. divaricata. Three colonies of P. divaricata harbored clade D throughout the year and the other 7 colonies changed clade type from C to D or vice versa, or contained a mixture of both clades on some sampling occasions.

Difference among species' responses to environmental fluctuations provides a general mechanism for the hypothesis. Previous experimental investigations of the insurance hypothesis have not examined this mechanism directly. 2. First, responses to temperature of four protist species were measured in laboratory microcosms. For each species, we measured the response of intrinsic rate of increase (r) and carrying capacity (K) to temperature. 3. Next, communities containing pairs of species were exposed to temperature fluctuations. Community biomass varied less when correlation in K between species (but not r) was more negative, and this resulted from more negative covariances in population sizes, as predicted. Results were contingent on species identity, with findings differing between analyses including or not including communities containing one particular species. 4. These findings provide the clearest support to date for this mechanism of the insurance hypothesis.

The results showed that there were no significant differences among the weight gains of prawn and carp in different treatments. However, the overall total production of prawn and fish together was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in T-3 and T-4 compared with other treatments. The total production for 3 months ranged between 2618 and 2916 kg ha(-1). The production of prawn was significantly higher (361.3 kg ha(-1)) in T-5 with a highest stocking density of 12 500 prawn ha(-1). Although there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the total production of prawn and fish together in T-3 and T-4, the highest net profit (Tk. 69 006 ha(-1)) was obtained in T-4. Therefore, from the result of the study it may be concluded that a stocking ratio of 4:1:2:1 of prawn:catla:rohu:silver carp at a total density of 20 000 ha(-1) may be recommended for prawn-carp polyculture in ponds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1355-557X,1365-2109,,,,JUL 20,2006,37,10,,,,,994,1000,,10.1111/j.1365-2109.2006.01518.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2006.01518.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000238881700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The steppe, typical of central Mongolia, is dominated by C-3 plants adapted to the continental climate. The following two questions are addressed: (1) how do NEE and its components: gross ecosystem production (GEP) and total ecosystem respiration (R-eco) vary seasonally? (2) how do NEE, GEP, and R-eco respond to biotic and abiotic factors? The hourly minimal NEE and the hourly maximal R-eco were -3.6 and 1.2 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively (negative values denoting net carbon uptake by the canopy from the atmosphere). Peak daily sums of NEE, GEP, and R-eco were -2.3, 3.5, and 1.5 g C m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The annual sums of GEP, R-eco, and NEE were 179, 138, and -41 g C m(-2), respectively. The carbon removal by sheep was estimated to range between 10 and 82 g C m(-2) yr(-1) using four different approaches. Including these estimates in the overall carbon budget yielded net ecosystem productivity of -23 to +20 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Thus, within the remaining experimental uncertainty the carbon budget at this steppe site can be considered to be balanced. For the growing period (from April 23 to October 21, 2003), 26% and 53% of the variation in daily NEE and GEP, respectively, could be explained by the changes in leaf area index. Seasonality of GEP, R-eco, and NEE was closely associated with precipitation, especially in the peak growing season when GEP and R-eco were largest. Water stress was observed in late July to early August, which switched the steppe from a carbon sink to a carbon source. For the entire growing period, the light response curves of daytime NEE showed a rather low apparent quantum yield (alpha=-0.0047 mu mol CO2 mu mol(-1) photons of photosynthetically active radiation). However, the alpha values varied with air temperature (T-a), vapor pressure deficit, and soil water content.",,,,,"Asanuma, J/A-2877-2008; Sugita, Michiaki/L-2155-2013; Li, Sheng-Gong/H-5101-2012; Eugster, Werner/E-5116-2010; Kotani, Ayumi/A-8487-2013","Asanuma, J/0000-0003-1258-5491; Sugita, Michiaki/0000-0002-2241-9334; Li, Sheng-Gong/0000-0003-4889-9927; Eugster, Werner/0000-0001-6067-0741; Liu, Jane/0000-0001-7760-2788",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,NOV,2005,11,11,,,,,1941,1955,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.01047.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.01047.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000233434900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

To better understand and document the rates of root decomposition in biofuel cropping systems, we compared the evolution of CO2 from roots incubated with samples of two Iowa Mollisols (Clarion and Nicollet). Root samples were collected from experimental plots for four cropping systems: a multispecies reconstructed prairie, grown with and without N fertilization, and continuous corn, grown with and without a ryegrass cover crop. Major structural components of the root samples (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose) as well as chemical composition (total C and N) were assessed. The root materials were incubated for 30 days at room temperature (22 A degrees C) by using an incubation apparatus with continuous airflow. The decomposition rates and half-lives of rapidly and slowly decomposable C fractions were calculated by fitting a two-component first-order kinetic model to the data. Mineralizable C ranged from 7 to 13 % of the added C. When the data for the two soils were combined, the CO2-C evolved was positively correlated with both the C/N ratio (r = 0.88**, p < 0.01) and the lignin/N ratio (r = 0.89**, p < 0.01) of the roots. For the Clarion soil, first-order decomposition rate constants for the rapid fraction ranged from 0.07 to 0.69 day(-1), whereas for the Nicollet soil they ranged from 0.09 to 0.66 day(-1). For both soils, the half-lives of the rapidly decomposable fraction ranged from 1 to 10 days, and half-lives of 204 to 770 days were observed for the slowly decomposable fractions. Among the cropping systems studied, the rapidly decomposable fraction of roots derived from the unfertilized prairie treatment was the largest. Those root residues also had the highest hemicellulose index and higher concentrations of arabinose, galactose, glucose, and xylose sugars than did roots of the other crops. Other decomposition parameters, such as the decomposition rates and half-lives obtained from the two-component model, were not correlated with the root composition parameters studied. Our results suggest that lignin did not inhibit the early rate of root C mineralization in mixed perennial crops. That information could be useful in refining models of root C dynamics in daily time steps or at the scale of a single growing season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0178-2762,1432-0789,,,,APR,2014,50,3,,,,,527,535,,10.1007/s00374-013-0870-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-013-0870-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000333022800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Towards this objective, the nematophagous fungus, Duddingtonia flagrans (Df), was used in a plot study against two main parasitic nematode species of goats, Teladorsagia circumcincta (Tcir) and Trichostrongylus colubriformis (Tcol). Worm-free, culled goats were experimentally infected with strains of Tcir and Tcol to constitute donors. Half of the animals were periodically given Df chlamydospores at a daily dose of 2.5 x 10(5) spores/kg BW while the remaining animals were kept as controls. At 5 time periods i.e. March, May, July, September and November 2001, corresponding to the main grazing season in France for goats, faeces were collected from the 6th day of fungus administration for the following 2 days to obtain approximately 1 kg of faeces from each group of animals: Tcir/Control, Tcol/Control, Tcir/Fungus, Tcol/Fungus. For each period and each group, the faeces were deposited on a 1 m(2) grass plot and the grass was cut (3 replicates) on weeks 2, 4, 6, 8,12 after deposition, for infective larval recovery. Larvae were counted and the results were expressed as a ratio of larvae/ eggs deposited. On the plots with the control faeces deposited in March, July and September, the grass infectivity due to Tcir and Tcol was similar and the maximum number occurred between 2 and 4 weeks post deposition. In May, the maximum numbers of larvae were not recorded until 8 weeks after deposition, due to high daily temperatures and dryness. In November, larval development took place only for Tcir. On the plots with the fungus treated faeces, a significant reduction in grass infectivity occurred for both nematodes and ranged from 50 - 60% in May, July and November deposits to 80 - 90% in the September deposit. On the contrary to these findings, no difference was recorded between the fungus and control plots for the March deposit.

To this end, an analysis has been made of data from the 1987 field experiment in 'la Crau' (France), where an extensive dry terrain with sparse vegetation was situated upwind from an irrigated field completely covered with grass. The change in surface roughness was negligible, the main effect being a change in surface heat flux. In the experiment, turbulence measurements were made of horizontal and vertical wind speed, temperature and humidity at various locations over both terrains. In this study, 12 runs of 1 h are analysed, roughly half of which were made when an advective inversion was present over the downstream terrain. Both vertical and horizontal velocity fluctuations are almost unaffected by the change in terrain. Temperature fluctuations are influenced by the fact that over the downstream terrain production of variance almost ceases and advection of variance becomes important. This results in a deviation of the sigma(theta)/theta* = f(z/L) relation found for homogeneous situations. Also, the temperature spectra of the unstable runs are affected, showing a different inertial subrange roll-off rate.

Leaving too little slash can leave the soil exposed to extreme fluctuations in soil conditions and fewer nutrients that may hinder future forest growth, while leaving too much slash makes it difficult for new trees to establish or increases fire hazard. This study investigated the impacts of blading and different loadings of slash (0, 15, 30 and 60 Mg ha-1 dry mass) on soil physical (temperature and moisture), chemical (soil solution) and biological (soil respiration and net ecosystem exchange) processes over 4 summers at a harvested jack pine stand within the Island Lake Biomass Harvest Experiment in northeastern Ontario. Soil temperature and moisture were highest in the bladed and lowest in the 60 Mg ha-1 slash loading. Soil solution chemistry was generally similar among the 0, 15 and 30 Mg ha-1 slash loadings. However, total organic carbon and potassium had higher concentrations at 60 Mg ha-1 treatment and lower concentrations in the bladed treatment, the opposite trend occurred for pH and nitrate. Over three years the concentrations of cations decreased and nitrogen species increased for bladed to 30 Mg ha-1 treatments. The 60 Mg ha-1 treatment had increases in some solutes over time suggesting there is a lag effect as needles and bark are incorporated into the soil. The soil respiration data showed that lowest rates of CO2 production occurred in the bladed treatment, but increased over time as the forest floor developed. CO2 production was highest in the 60 Mg ha-1 slash loading, with high rates of soil respiration in the first year, as fine debris from slash deposited onto the soil, however little photosynthesis occurred in these treatments. Thus retention of small to moderate amounts of slash seem to be sufficient for maintaining a suitable balance of soil conditions for a regenerating forest over the short term.",,,,,,"Hazlett, Paul/0000-0003-2485-8426",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1127,1872-7042,,,,OCT 1,2021,497,,,,,,,,119517,10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119517,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119517,,JUL 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000684973100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we explore the extent to which modeled biogeochemical responses to changing climate are affected by the selection of the climate downscaling method and training observations used at the montane landscape of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. We evaluated three downscaling methods: the delta method (or the change factor method), monthly quantile mapping (Bias Correction-Spatial Disaggregation, or BCSD), and daily quantile regression (Asynchronous Regional Regression Model, or ARRM). Additionally, we trained outputs from four atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) (CCSM3, HadCM3, PCM, and GFDL-CM2.1) driven by higher (A1fi) and lower (B1) future emissions scenarios on two sets of observations (1/8 degrees resolution grid vs. individual weather station) to generate the high-resolution climate input for the forest biogeochemical model PnET-BGC (eight ensembles of six runs). The choice of downscaling approach and spatial resolution of the observations used to train the downscaling model impacted modeled soil moisture and streamflow, which in turn affected forest growth, net N mineralization, net soil nitrification, and stream chemistry. All three downscaling methods were highly sensitive to the observations used, resulting in projections that were significantly different between station-based and grid-based observations. The choice of downscaling method also slightly affected the results, however not as much as the choice of observations. Using spatially smoothed gridded observations and/or methods that do not resolve sub-monthly shifts in the distribution of temperature and/or precipitation can produce biased results in model applications run at greater temporal and/or spatial resolutions. These results underscore the importance of carefully considering field observations used for training, as well as the downscaling method used to generate climate change projections, for smaller-scale modeling studies. Different sources of variability including selection of AOGCM, emissions scenario, downscaling technique, and data used for training downscaling models, result in a wide range of projected forest ecosystem responses to future climate change.",,,,,"Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014; Brook, Hubbard/AAD-1112-2022","Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890; Campbell, John/0000-0003-4956-1696",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,JUL,2016,26,5,,,,,1321,1337,,10.1890/15-0745,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/15-0745,,,,,,,,27755746,,,,,WOS:000379603900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Both of these affective states can be detrimental to animal welfare in modern housing environments. In comparison to the well-validated tests for assessing fear in laying hens, tests for measuring anxiety are less developed. Perception of a threat can result in an attention bias that may indicate anxious affective states in individual hens following playback of an alarm call. In Experiment 1, an attention bias test was applied to hens that differed in their range access to show that hens that never ranged were more vigilant (stretching of the neck and looking around: P < 0.001) and slower to feed following the second alarm call playback (P = 0.01) compared with hens that ranged daily. All hens showed a reduction in comb temperature following the first alarm call (P < 0.001). In Experiment 2, an open field test was used to determine an effective dose of 2 mg/kg for the anxiogenic drug meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) in adult laying hens. Hens dosed with 2 mg/kg showed reduced locomotion compared with a saline solution (P < 0.05). In Experiment 3, 2 mg/kg m-CPP or saline was administered to adult hens previously habituated to the open field arena to pharmacologically validate an attention bias test as a measure of anxiety. Hens dosed with m-CPP were slower to feed (P = 0.02) and faster to vocalize following a second alarm call playback (P = 0.03) but these hens did not exhibit the same vigilance behavior as documented in Experiment 1. The m-CPP hens also spent more time stepping and vocalizing (both P < 0.001) than the saline hens. An attention bias test could be used to assess anxiety. However, behavioral responses of hens may vary depending on their age or test environment familiarity, thus further refinement of the test is required. In these tests, 2 mg/kg of m-CPP resulted in motionless behavior when the environment was novel, but more movement and vocalizing when the environment was familiar.

Under conditions of low current speed, dense assemblages of shellfish can rapidly deplete ambient food concentrations, resulting in measurable effects on growth and condition index. A flume study demonstrated significant growth and condition index responses to resource competition after reductions as small as 27% in relatively high ambient food concentrations (approximate to 4.6 mu g/l chlorophyll). Growth rates and condition index are linearly correlated with the average chlorophyll ration consumed. A field study demonstrated similar growth responses when the shellfish were cultured over a range of densities in a commercial aquaculture setting. By comparing the growth and condition index responses in the two experiments, we infer the degree of resource depletion occurring in the field from the correlations constructed in the flume study. Although physiological responses to food limitation will necessarily be site specific to varying combinations of temperature, current speed, and food concentration or quality, this work provides a unique opportunity to compare the growth response of oysters and scallops under a wide range of food availability in both laboratory and commercial aquaculture settings. Doubling the stocking density from 2.5 to 5.0 kg of oysters per bag resulted in a 20% decrease in both the condition index and the growth rate (percent increase in weight). These observations may assist commercial growers determine optimal stocking density for their aquaculture grow-out systems. Natural food availability in Point Judith Pond, a classic salt wedge estuary, is highly variable on a daily basis and is related to the tidal exchange. The variation in food concentration superimposed on the tidal current oscillation leads to massive changes in food flux and the degree of local resource competition. Scallop and oyster clearance rates (milliliters per minute) were constant over a wide range of chlorophyll concentrations, suggesting that these species will filter natural seston at a near-constant rate despite fourfold tidal variations in food concentrations. Scallop clearance rates were reduced when chlorophyll concentrations were depleted to below 12% of the natural levels, suggesting a threshold feeding response.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,,,JUN,1996,15,2,,,,,271,283,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UX15400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The most alkaline pH that was applied corresponds to that measured in sap extracted from shoots of tomato and Forsythia plants experiencing, respectively, soil drying or a relatively high photon flux density (PFD), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and temperature in the leaf microclimate. The negative correlation between PFD/VPD/temperature and g(s) determined in well-watered Forsythia plants exposed to a naturally varying summer microclimate was eliminated by spraying the plants with relatively alkaline but not acidic buffers, providing evidence for a novel pH-based signalling mechanism linking the aerial microclimate with stomatal aperture. Increasing the pH of the foliar spray only reduced g(s) in plants of the abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient flacca mutant of tomato when ABA was simultaneously sprayed onto leaves or injected into stems. In well-watered Forsythia plants exposed to a naturally varying summer microclimate (variable PFD, VPD, and temperature), xylem pH and leaf ABA concentration fluctuated but were positively correlated.

J,"Duchardt, CJ; Beck, JL; Augustine, DJ",,,,"Duchardt, Courtney J.; Beck, Jeffrey L.; Augustine, David J.",,,Mountain Plover habitat selection and nest survival in relation to weather variability and spatial attributes of black-tailed prairie dog disturbance,CONDOR,,,,,,,,,,,,"Habitat loss and altered disturbance regimes have led to declines in many species of grassland and sagebrush birds, including the imperiled Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus). In certain parts of their range Mountain Plovers rely almost exclusively on black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies as nesting habitat. Previous studies have examined Mountain Plover nest and brood survival on prairie dog colonies, but little is known about how colony size and shape influence these vital rates or patterns of habitat selection. We examined how (1) adult habitat utilization, (2) nest-site selection, and (3) nest success responded to a suite of local- and site-level variables on large prairie dog colony complexes in northeastern Wyoming. Abundance of adult Mountain Plovers was highest on points within older, medium-sized (100-500 ha) colonies with high cover of annual forbs and bare ground (5.8 birds km(-2)), but lower on extremely large (>2,000 ha) colonies (2.1 birds km(-2)). Nest sites were characterized by high proportions of annual forbs and bare ground and low cactus cover and vegetation height. Nest survival was higher for older nests, and nests with lower cactus cover, and decreased with increasing temperatures. Uncertainty was high for models of daily nest survival, potentially because of 2 competing sources of nest failure: nest depredation and nest abandonment or inviability of eggs. Drivers of these 2 sources of nest failure differed, with inclement weather and higher temperatures associated with nest abandonment or egg inviability. We highlight how prairie dogs alter vegetation structure and bare ground heterogeneously across the landscape, and how this in turn influences bird abundance and nest distribution at different temporal and spatial scales. Furthermore, our work reveals how partitioning the causes of nest failure during nest survival analyses enhances understanding of survival rate covariates.",,,,,,"Duchardt, Courtney/0000-0003-4563-0199; Beck, Jeffrey/0000-0003-0236-7343",,,,,,,,,,,,,0010-5422,1938-5129,,,,FEB,2020,122,1,,,,,,,,10.1093/condor/duz059,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/condor/duz059,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000526049800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The buoyant condensation level (BCL) and buoyant mixing temperature ((BM)) quantify the degree to which the atmosphere is preconditioned for moist convection and can be calculated for any time of day or year using standard vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. Unlike the lifted condensation level and convective inhibition, the BCL is constructed through incremental mixing from the surface rather than lifting a hypothetical parcel. In this regard, the BCL represents a conserved condensation level diagnostic inherent to a given profile. The BCL and (BM) are shown to be applicable over a range of climate regimes and respond to synoptic and mesoscale forcings, illustrating its broader utility.

The limited number of weather stations driving snowpack models over large and remote northern areas generates great uncertainty in SWE evolution. A data assimilation (DA) scheme was developed to improve SWE estimates by updating meteorological forcing data and snowpack states with passive microwave (PMW) satellite observations and without using any surface-based data. In this DA experiment, a particle filter with a Sequential Importance Resampling algorithm (SIR) was applied and an inflation technique of the observation error matrix was developed to avoid ensemble degeneracy. Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2) brightness temperature (T-B) observations were assimilated into a chain of models composed of the Crocus multilayer snowpack model and radiative transfer models. The microwave snow emission model (Dense Media Radiative Transfer - Multi-Layer model, DMRT-ML), the vegetation transmissivity model (omega-tau(opt)), and atmospheric and soil radiative transfer models were calibrated to simulate the contributions from the snowpack, the vegetation, and the soil, respectively, at the top of the atmosphere. DA experiments were performed for 12 stations where daily continuous SWE measurements were acquired over 4 winters (2012-2016). Best SWE estimates are obtained with the assimilation of the T-Bs at 11, 19, and 37 GHz in vertical polarizations. The overall SWE bias is reduced by 68% compared to the original SWE simulations, from 23.7 kg m(-2) without assimilation to 7.5 kg m(-2) with the assimilation of the three frequencies. The overall SWE relative percentage of error (RPE) is 14.1% (19% without assimilation) for sites with a fraction of forest cover below 75 %, which is in the range of accuracy needed for hydrological applications. This research opens the way for global applications to improve SWE estimates over large and remote areas, even when vegetation contributions are up to 50% of the PMW signal.",,,,,,"Cosme, Emmanuel/0000-0001-7349-6973; Larue, Fanny/0000-0003-2166-4802",,,,,,,,,,,,,1027-5606,1607-7938,,,,NOV 5,2018,22,11,,,,,5711,5734,,10.5194/hess-22-5711-2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5711-2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000449343700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The mutant H64V protein's CO vibrational pure dephasing rate is similar to 20% slower (narrower pure dephasing linewidth) than the native protein at all temperatures, although the only difference between the two proteins is the replacement of the native's polar distal histidine by a non-polar valine.

Seasonal and inter-annual variability in ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange is attributed to numerous climate drivers. However, climate effects on metabolism often override ecological functions. This study seeks insight into which biological and ecological processes influence temporal patterns of ecosystem productivity in natural ecosystems. 2. The specific objectives of this study are to (i) identify seasonal and inter-annual patterns of ecosystem-level photosynthesis in relation to climatic conditions, (ii) examine and compare seasonal and inter-annual variations in leaf traits for annual grasses and oak trees across multiple years, and (iii) explore interactions among leaf traits and ecosystem-level photosynthesis across multiple seasons and years. 3. We conducted this study in a woody savanna and open grassland in California, USA. Ecosystem-level photosynthetic rates of annual grasses (A(grass)) and oak tree canopy (A(canopy)) were deduced from eddy covariance measurements over a 7-year period (2001 and 2007). In conjunction, we sampled grass and oak leaves at weekly to monthly intervals and constructed a multi-year time series of leaf nitrogen concentration (N), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), leaf carbon concentration (C), and leaf carbon stable isotope discrimination (Delta). 4. Given the same grass community age or tree canopy age, inter-annual variations of the photosynthetic rates were up to 1-2 gC m-2 day-1 for annual grasses and oak trees while the two types of vegetation were exposed to different, wide ranges of inter-annual climate fluctuations: up to 5 degrees C in daily mean soil temperature, 15% in soil moisture, and 10 mol m-2 day-1 in photosynthetically active radiation. 5. While both grass and oak leaf traits varied seasonally and inter-annually, they experienced temporal patterns and seasonal peaks that were distinct from one another. Multi-year means of grass leaf N, C, Delta, and LMA were 2 center dot 3%, 40 center dot 8%, 22 center dot 6 parts per thousand and 71 center dot 3 g m-2, respectively; multi-year means of oak leaf N, C, Delta, and LMA were 1 center dot 9%, 45 center dot 1%, 20 center dot 5 parts per thousand and 132 g m-2, respectively. 6. Based on the analysis of variance, seasonal and inter-annual terms were associated with A(grass) or A(canopy) up to 90% or 81%. On the other hand, variations in leaf N, LMA, C, delta, and their interactions could statistically explain about 53% and 26% of variations in A(grass) and A(canopy,) respectively. 7. We discussed possible biological and ecological processes involved in regulating seasonal and inter-annual variability in ecosystem-level photosynthesis. Clearly, seasonal and inter-annual variation in ecosystem photosynthesis was strongly associated with the dynamics of leaf traits.",,,,,"Baldocchi, Dennis/A-1625-2009; Manchun, Kang/D-3194-2011","Baldocchi, Dennis/0000-0003-3496-4919; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,FEB,2011,25,1,,,,,258,270,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01779.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01779.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000286468500026,View Full Record in Web of Science

Solms,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"The elevation of atmospheric CO2 is an inevitable trend that would lead to significant impact on the interrelated carbon and nitrogen cycles through microbial activities in the aquatic ecosystem. Eutrophication has become a common trophic state of inland waters throughout the world, but how the elevated CO2 affects N cycles in such eutrophic water with algal bloom, and how vegetative restoration helps to mitigate N2O emission remains unknown. We conducted the experiments to investigate the effects of ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 (a[CO2], e[CO2]; 400, 800 mu mol.mol(-1)) with and without the floating aquatic plant, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, on N-transformation in eutrophic water using the N-15 tracer method. The nitrification could be slightly inhibited by e[CO2], due mainly to the competition for dissolved inorganic carbon between algae and nitrifiers. The e[CO2] promoted denitrification and N2O emissions from eutrophic water without growth of plants, leading to aggravation of greenhouse effect and forming a vicious cycle. However, growth of the aquatic plant, Eichhornia crassipes, slightly promoted nitrification, but reduced N2O emissions from eutrophic water under e[CO2] conditions, thereby attenuating the negative effect of e[CO2] on N2O emissions. In the experiment, the N transformation was influenced by many factors such as pH, DO and algae density, except e[CO2] and plant presence. The pH could be regulated through diurnal photosynthesis and respiration of algae and mitigated the acidification of water caused by e[CO2], leading to an appropriate pH range for both nitrifying and denitrifying microbes. Algal respiration at night could consume DO and enhance abundance of denitrifying functional genes (nirK, nosZ) in water, which was also supposed to be a critical factor affecting denitrification and N2O emissions. This study clarifies how the greenhouse effect caused by e[CO2] mediates N biogeochemical cycle in the aquatic ecosystem, and how vegetative restoration mitigates greenhouse gas emission.

Since macrophytes are profound components of aquatic systems, predicting their response to extreme climatic events is crucial for implementation of climate change adaptation strategies. We therefore performed an experiment in 24 outdoor enclosures (400 L) separating the impact of a 4 degrees C increase in mean temperature with the same increase, that is the same total amount of energy input, but resembling a climate scenario with extreme variability, oscillating between 0 degrees C and 8 degrees C above present conditions. We show that at the moderate nutrient conditions provided in our study, neither an increase in mean temperature nor heat waves lead to a shift from a plant-dominated to an algal-dominated system. Instead, we show that species-specific responses to climate change among submerged macrophytes may critically influence species composition and thereby ecosystem functioning. Our results also imply that more fluctuating temperatures affect the number of flowers produced per plant leading to less sexual reproduction. Our findings therefore suggest that predicted alterations in climate regimes may influence both plant interactions and reproductive strategies, which have the potential to inflict changes in biodiversity, community structure and ecosystem functioning.",,,,,,"Urrutia Cordero, Pablo/0000-0001-9560-8374; Hollander, Johan/0000-0002-4207-2956; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; He, Liang/0000-0003-2513-7380",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JAN,2017,23,1,,,,,108,116,,10.1111/gcb.13405,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13405,,,,,,,,27359059,,,,,WOS:000390218300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many studies have stressed the need for a high temporal and spatial resolution ET product that minimizes the bias between modeled and actual water use for proper water accounting. We present a hybrid single-source energy balance (HSEB) model that calculates evapotranspiration at the field-scale based on the synergistic use of Sentinel-2, Landsat, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) MODIS land surface temperature products. The model operates in Google Earth Engine as a time series using global atmospheric variables and 100-m Copernicus Land cover data. Evaluation of HSEB for calculating evaporation over 29 flux tower sites within an extensive range of climatic conditions and biomes over the US, Europe and Australia for 2018-2020 shows that the model significantly improves the temporal and spatial components of ET mapping. Overall, HSEB performed well in all considered biome types and climatic conditions (r = 0.81, 0.74, and 0.8, a Nash-Sutcliff efficiency of 0.6, 0.74, 0.8, and a bias of 4%, 1%, and - 0.9% at the daily, weekly, and monthly scales, respectively). Root Mean Square Error averaged at 1.31 mm/day. Comparison of instantaneous latent heat fluxes of the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) against tower data shows that HSEB produces acceptable results, although ECOSTRESS had a slightly lower bias (3.8% for HSEB vs. -0.8% for ECOSTRESS). HSEB performed better over croplands. We also discuss comparisons of sharpened LST from VIIRS VNP02, VNP21, MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-3, and LST from ECOSTRESS versus ground LST measurements, and briefly discuss the sensitivity of HSEB to the thermal data used. Both ECOSTRESS and Landsat showed better performance at different LST ranges and time of day when compared to LST observation collected over a small potato field in Lebanon.

We assess patterns of ant species and functional diversity, their environmental predictors, and biogeographic significance in the central North Kimberley region of Australia's seasonal tropics. Pitfall traps were used to sample ants at 69 plots in representative savanna habitats, collecting a total of 158 species from 30 genera. Total richness was estimated to be as high as 237 species. At least 29 species across 12 genera appear to have been collected for the first time. Only a single invasive ant was recorded from the study area. Based on cluster analysis we identified six compositionally distinct ant communities, each associated with a combination of vegetation type and underlying geology. Species richness and functional diversity was highest in savanna woodlands and grasslands on sandstone-derived soils, with increasing richness also predicted by a lower mean daily temperature range, a more complex understorey, and lower precipitation seasonality. The abundance of nearly all commonly trapped species was related to temperature, moisture, and habitat variables, although these relationships were highly idiosyncratic. Nearly 40 % of the collected species are known only from the North Kimberley region. The high level of endemism, together with the lack of introduced ant species, identifies the North Kimberley ant fauna as having outstanding biodiversity value. Our identification of ant community types based on mappable soil and vegetation units provides a basis for predicting ant distribution throughout the broader region, and therefore contributing to regional conservation planning and management.",,,,,"dixon, kingsley wayne/A-8133-2016; Cross, Adam/S-2710-2019; Cross, Adam/AAR-9004-2021; Mucina, Ladislav/A-6275-2019; Andersen, Alan N/F-8763-2010; Mucina, Ladislav/M-8875-2019; Mucina, Laco/H-5490-2014","dixon, kingsley wayne/0000-0001-5989-2929; Cross, Adam/0000-0002-5214-2612; Mucina, Ladislav/0000-0003-0317-8886; Andersen, Alan N/0000-0003-1487-3323; Mucina, Ladislav/0000-0003-0317-8886; Mucina, Laco/0000-0003-0317-8886; Cross, Sophie/0000-0002-1126-6811",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-3115,1572-9710,,,,AUG,2016,25,9,,,,,1727,1759,,10.1007/s10531-016-1154-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1154-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000379853300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

L.",,,EFFECTS OF SIMULATED RAPID WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS (HYDROPEAKING) ON SURVIVAL OF SENSITIVE BENTHIC SPECIES,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sudden changes in water releases below hydropower facilities (hydropeaking) can dramatically affect benthic organisms. Aquatic gastropods are an ideal organism for studying such effects because they inhabit littoral areas that are frequently dewatered during hydropeaking and have a low dispersal ability making them highly susceptible. We explored mortality rates of Taylorconcha serpenticola, the threatened Bliss Rapids snail, in four laboratory experiments that simulated hydropeaking during varying seasons and varying hydropower operation scenarios. Experiments were conducted in a light and temperature controlled Conviron (R) and were designed to simulate conditions on the Middle Snake River, Idaho, USA, in reaches that are subjected to hydropeaking. Experiments examined the effects of three air temperatures (winter = -7 degrees C, spring = 17 degrees C and summer = 37 degrees C), three durations of exposure to air (2, 4 and 6 h), three dewatering rates (instantaneous, 0.3 and 0.15m h(-1)), two substrate textures (smooth and vesicular) and consecutive daily exposures (1 to 15 days). With 2 h exposures >80% of gastropods survived under both the summer and winter condition, but with 6 h exposure only 60% survived under winter conditions and almost none survived under summer conditions. Survivorship of gastropods was always high under spring conditions (>90%) even when exposed for 6 h d(-1) for up to 15 days. When subjected to consecutive daily exposures, survivorship was lowest under winter conditions. Neither rate of dewatering nor substrate texture affected survivorship. Our data suggest that hydropower operations that include rapid stage fluctuations under extreme temperatures can cause high mortality of sensitive benthic species especially when exposure time is prolonged. Future water management policy decisions will need to consider these factors to manage for protection of aquatic species of conservation concern.

Eighty juvenile sea cucumbers, with a mean wet weight of 2.8 +/- 0.8 g, were allocated to 20 experimental groups and allocated to constant temperature (18 degrees C), and small (18 +/- 2 degrees C), medium (18 +/- 4 degrees C) and large (18 +/- 6 degrees C) daily temperature fluctuation regimes. Five groups were allocated to each regime. After the 35-day experimental period, the effects of different temperature regimes on growth, activities of glycolytic enzymes, enzymatic antioxidant defenses and expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) in juvenile sea cucumbers were measured. The small and medium temperature fluctuations could accelerate growth of sea cucumbers and the large temperature fluctuation retarded growth. Hexokinase activity at small and medium temperature treatments was significantly higher than that at the constant temperature. SOD activities at medium and large temperature fluctuations were significantly higher than that at the small temperature fluctuation treatment. These results indicated a possible higher utilization of carbohydrate through glycolytic cycle at the small and medium temperature fluctuations, and an enhancement of oxidative stress under the medium and the large temperature fluctuations. Hsp70 level at the large temperature fluctuation was significantly higher than at the other three treatments. The enhancement of Hsp70 at the large temperature fluctuation indicated a possible high level of protein damage which might result in an increased energetic cost that could retard growth of sea cucumbers.

Coss. [syn. Oryzopsis miliacea (L.) Asch. et Schw.], common name smilo grass, is a native Mediterranean perennial species, recently considered an important genetic resource for bioenergy purposes. Unfortunately, the germination of seed of P. millaceum is generally poor and slow, due to seed dormancy and may create serious problems to the establishment of the crop, so knowledge of germination behaviour is an indispensable requirement for a potentially widespread use of this species for bioenergy production in the future. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of 4 seed treatments: (control, sulphuric acid, osmopriming with PEG + GA(3), sulphuric acid + osmopriming with PEG + GA(3)), 5 ecotypes collected in Sicily (South Italy), 2 storage seed temperatures after treatments (4 +/- 1 degrees C and 20 +/- 1 degrees C) and 7 storage times after treatments (from 0 to 6 months) on seed germination performances. Daily and final (12 days) germination were recorded and total percentage germination and Mean Germination Time (MGT) were calculated. In addition, the biomass production, along two growing seasons in a semi-arid environment, was evaluated in the field experiment. Germination, on the average of the other factors, was 0.8% in the control (untreated seeds), 2.1% in seeds treated with osmopriming and 5.9% in sulphuric acid treated seeds; it was significantly enhanced (88.8%) by the treatment with sulphuric acid + gosmopriminp, which also meant a significant reduction in the MGT. The effectiveness of the latter treatment was persistent for 6 months, especially if seeds were stored at 20 +/- 1 degrees C. Among ecotypes, there emerged a discrete variability both in response to seed treatments, storage temperature and storage time, as well as for aboveground dry biomass yield, which ranged from 6.1 to 11.5 t ha(-1) in the first and from 10.0 to 14.6 t ha(-1) in the second growing season. This knowledge could contribute to facilitating the use of smilo grass seed and to favouring a widespread of the crop for bioenergy purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0926-6690,1872-633X,,,,JAN,2020,143,,,,,,,,111891,10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.111891,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2019.111891,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000503323200040,View Full Record in Web of Science

As an effort to reduce the environmental impact, an integrated system with shrimp and macroalgae researched abundantly as the macroalgae are naturally capable of removing nutrient from wastewater. As a bioremediation potential, this study investigates the nutrient uptake and macroalgal growth performance in short term (21 days) using an outdoor recirculating water system stocked with two local macroalgae species Gracilaria edulis and Gracilaria changii as biofilter. The stocking density of 3 kg/m(2) with the flow rate of the water system set to 200 Lihr during the operation. The temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and salinity was measured daily throughout the experimental period. Water temperature in all tanks were almost constant and ranged between 28.5 degrees C to 29.1 degrees C. The higher mean of pH of around 8.26 +/- 0.15 and 8.28 +/- 0.05 was observed in tanks with G. edulis and G. changii respectively. In the control tanks, mean pH was 7.87 +/- 0.09. The mean concentrations of dissolved oxygen in G. edulis, G. changii and control tanks were 6.89 +/- 0.05 mg/L, 6.84 +/- 0.06 mg/L, and 6.10 +/- 0.03 mg/L respectively.

S.",,,Design and evaluation of modified screen net house for off-season vegetable raising in composite climate,ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Currently the use of conventional screen net houses for off-season vegetable raising in north India composite climate is not so effective and has many constructional and operational limitations like poor structural design, higher constructional cost, no greenhouse effect in winter and higher plant temperatures in summer. Similarly, the use of polyethylene sheet covered greenhouses also has problems like much higher constructional and operational costs and higher inside air temperatures in summers. In this study, modified designs of 500 m(2) (one kanal) and 250 m(2) (half kanal) screen net house have been presented particularly suitable for composite climate (where both winters as well as summers are harsh) as a replacement for conventional net house and polyethylene sheet covered greenhouse design. To make these designs low cost and more effective, low tunnels (covered with low density polyethylene sheet) have been designed and used in winter over the plant rows to generate localized greenhouse effect for faster plant growth. By doing so, average daily air temperature under the tunnels was raised about 910 degrees C above the open field air temperature. In this way, huge cost of covering the net house or greenhouse during winter with costly polyethylene sheet could be saved. Similarly, in extreme summer when the ambient air temperature exceeded 40 degrees C (during the fruiting stage of the crop) a 50% shade net was used inside the modified net house at 2.5 m height (instead of using active cooling system) resulting in 4-6 degrees C drop in the plant temperature. Experimental evaluation of the modified net house was conducted during winter and summer months of year 2007-08 (December to June) by growing brinjal crop and compared with conventional net house, polyethylene sheet greenhouse and in open field condition. It was observed that due to the combined effect of low tunnels (in winter) and shade net (in summer), the micro-climatic parameters like air temperature, plant temperature, solar radiation and light intensity remained within desirable range during different stages of crop growth resulting in 37.6% and 11.5% increase in the yield of brinjal crop as compared to conventional net house and PE covered greenhouse yield, respectively, at 31 degrees N latitude. Economic analysis of the modified net house was also conducted and compared with the conventional net house and PE covered greenhouse of the same area. It was observed that 500 m(2) area modified net house (coupled with low tunnels and shade net) produces highest yield and has the highest net present worth (Rs 3,35,324) and the lowest payback period (5.2 years) as compared to the conventional net house (Rs 2,04,712 and 6.5 years) and PE covered greenhouse (Rs 1,52,614 and 10.5 years). On the other hand for 250 m(2) modified net house, the net present worth and payback period was Rs 1,20,417 and 9.7 years as compared to Rs 65,497 and 11.5 years and Rs 10,616 and 17 years for conventional net house and PE covered greenhouse.

Spatial and seasonal distributions of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fronts (similar to 1-100 km) in the vicinity of main French rivers, Gironde and Loire, are explored over the continental shelf North of 45 degrees N in the Bay of Biscay. A high resolution (1 km spatial and daily temporal resolutions) dataset of 11 years' (2003-2013) remotely sensed SST by MODIS sensor onboard Aqua and Terra satellites has been investigated and compared with coastal numerical model experiments. The detection and characterization fronts with fluctuating amplitudes is achieved through the Singularity Analysis (i.e. the process of calculating the degree of regularity or irregularity of a function at each point in a domain). Seasonality of frontal activity in the Bay of Biscay is then described based on the long-term satellite SST archive and coastal operational model simulations. The identified hot spots of higher frontal occurrences correspond on one hand to previously observed features (e.g. tidal fronts) but also reveal new features. These are investigated to identify fine-scale dynamical drivers. In winter, density fronts are prominent in a coastal strip where freshwater influence is important. In spring, this strip diminishes as plumes detach from the coast, while tidal fronts become apparent in other regions. In summer, tidal fronts in Ushant region and internal wave activity along the shelf break dominate. In autumn, coastal density fronts due to freshwater inputs reappear as these inputs increase, and reduced stratification causes a weakening of the Ushant and shelf break fronts. Additional information and an effort to dynamically interpret these fronts, based on a systematic investigation of the whole seasonal cycle and including modeling insights from coastal operational oceanography, complement the description of frontal activity in the Bay of Biscay.",,,,,"Sudre, Joël/G-9220-2018; Charria, Guillaume/F-9126-2010","Sudre, Joël/0000-0001-8876-5179; Charria, Guillaume/0000-0001-5204-1654; Reverdin, Gilles/0000-0002-5583-8236",,,,,,,,,,,,,0278-4343,1873-6955,,,,JUL 5,2017,144,,,,,,65,79,,10.1016/j.csr.2017.06.015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2017.06.015,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000407660600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most studies of the thermoregulatory ecology of bats have been limited to laboratory experiments or studies of individuals roosting in artificial structures. 2. We investigated the interaction between thermoregulatory behaviour and roost choice in reproductive female Western Long-Eared Bats, Myotis evotis (H. Allen), roosting solitarily in natural rock crevices. The study was conducted in the badlands of the South Saskatchewan River Valley, Alberta, Canada, during 1997 and 1998. 3. Individuals used torpor every day and the amount of time spoilt in torpor was primarily influenced by the amount of time available to do so. Minimum body temperature was influenced by ambient temperature, although the form of this relationship differed between pregnant and lactating females. Pregnant females used deep torpor more frequently than lactating females. 4. All individuals roosted in rock crevices but pregnant and lactating females chose roosts that were different in structure and thermal characteristics. Pregnant females chose horizontal roosts that cooled at night but warmed quickly during the day, thus allowing passive rewarming from torpor. Lactating females chose vertical roosts that stayed warm at night when non-volant pups were present, thereby minimizing thermoregulatory costs to the young. 5. The behaviours observed are adaptive, but differ from those of other temperate-zone insectivorous bats that have been studied in the past. This highlights the importance of studying free-ranging animals living in natural habitat if we are to have an accurate view of thermoregulatory strategies and the importance of roost characteristics for roost-site selection.",,,,,"Barclay, Robert/D-5514-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,FEB,2002,16,1,,,,,18,26,,10.1046/j.0269-8463.2001.00602.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.0269-8463.2001.00602.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000174295500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Treatments were (1) soil application of low metal content MSS, (2) soil application of metal-enriched municipal solid sewage sludge (EMSS), and (3) control. The MSS application represented a dose of 200 Mg dry weight (dw) ha(-1). Soil columns were incubated at room temperature for 15 d and were irrigated daily with distilled water to make a total of 557 mm. Leachates were collected and analyzed for HMs and nutrients. The Ni and Pb added to soil via MSS and EMSS were found to be leached through the 20 cm columns of calcareous sandy soil although Ni and Pb concentrations in the percolate were small relative to the total amounts of metals applied. Losses of K(+) from the EMSS, MSS, and control were 92.5, 82.0, and 52.5 kg ha(-1), respectively. Losses of Mg(2+) were in the range from 104.4 (control treatment) to 295.2 kg ha(-1) (EMSS), while the loss of Ca(2+) was in the range from 265.0 (control treatment) to 568.2 kg ha(-1) (EMSS).

Moreover, studies of gradients may assist in an identification of the factors important to the outcomes of trophic interactions. We investigated the role of elevation-based variation in environmental conditions (temperature and relative humidity) and foliar nitrogen on tri-trophic interactions in Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Fagaceae) during 2001 and 2002. Quercus gambelii displayed significant elevational and seasonal fluctuation in foliar nitrogen content, and sites with similar environmental conditions produced similar foliar quality. However, leaf-miners, Phyllonorycter spec. (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) and Cameraria spec. (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), did not perform better on trees with a greater nitrogen content. Overall densities of both species declined significantly in 2002, most likely due to severe drought conditions in the south-western USA. Both species exhibited significant, but distinct, patterns in emergence rate with elevation. While environmentally based fluctuation in foliar nitrogen failed to predict the result of trophic interactions, site environmental conditions, as measured by temperature and relative humidity, were strongly related to differences in leaf-miner performance and mortality.

Microzooplankton were abundant in the surface mixed layer at all stations, with concentrations ranging between 2000 and 14,000 organisms l-1. The community was dominated by Protozoa, which contributed >98% of the numerical abundance of microzooplankton and >80% of their standing stocks. Three families of Protozoa-the Strombidiidae (Ciliophora: Oligotrichida), Gymnodiniidae and Peridiniidae (both Sarcomastigophora: Dinoflagellida)-dominated the microzooplankton, contributing >70% of the standing stocks. This varied between 0.6 and 20.3 mugC l-1 and was positively correlated to ambient phytoplankton concentrations. Microzooplankton standing stocks within the mixed layer showed a distinct latitudinal gradient that varied between 6.5 and 9.8 mugC l-1 at 60 and 47-degrees-N, respectively. When integrated over the mixed layer depth, microzooplankton standing stocks ranged between 300 and 428 mgC m-2 at 47 and 60-degrees-N, respectively. Microzooplankton standing stocks were approximately one-quarter to one-third that of the phytoplankton. Microzooplankton herbivory, investigated using dilution experiments, was vigorous. Microzooplankton turned over between 2 and 45% of the phytoplankton standing stock daily, thereby consuming between 0.5 and 17 mug phytoplankton carbon l-1 day-1. The magnitude of this activity was positively related to seawater temperature and to phytoplankton concentration. Microzooplankton consumed the equivalent of 100-800% their body carbon each day. Analysis of phytogenic carbon flux in the surface mixed layer showed that microzooplankton herbivory was more than an order of magnitude higher than copepod herbivory. Microzooplankton in the mixed layer grazed between 288 and 589 mgC m-2 day-1 and accounted for between 39 and 115% of the phytoplankton production at 60 and 52-degrees-N, respectively.

To minimize scallop stress caused by excessive handling, in situ benthic chambers were used for marking experiments. Once marked, scallops (shell height range: 38.4-75.8 mm) remained on site in a large benthic enclosure and were collected at regular time intervals to count new striae formed after marking, over a period of 3 months. A 3-h exposure period with calcein (150 mg l(-1)) was sufficiently long to create a detectable mark in nearly shells. It was, however, impossible to count the striae in 48.2% of the shells (mainly large specimens) because of a very small growth after marking. Lack of significant mortality during the experiments indicated that tested calcein concentrations were not lethal. A decrease in shell growth rate was observed after marking but the respective impacts of calcein toxicity and changes in environmental conditions could not be discriminated. Our results suggest that in situ calcein marking inside benthic chambers is suitable for shell growth studies of scallops, provided the latter are not too old. After marking, the juvenile C. radula formed an average of one stria every 2.1 days in summer. Reports of 2-day periodicity in biological rhythms are rare. Striae formation in C. radula may be controlled by an endogenous oscillator, synchronized by an environmental cue acting as a zeitgeber, such as seawater temperature or sea level pressure, both of which exhibit 2-day variations in the Pacific Ocean. As in many other scallop species, C. radula forms striae periodically under natural conditions, but this study shows that in pectinid juveniles, this periodicity can deviate from a daily cycle. These results suggest that C. radula shells have tremendous potential for recording environmental conditions during periods ranging from months to a few years and with a resolution of 2 days.",,,,,"Thébault, Julien/F-6198-2011","Thébault, Julien/0000-0002-3111-4428; Fichez, Renaud/0000-0002-2374-1018",,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,,,,,MAY,2006,149,2,,,,,257,267,,10.1007/s00227-005-0198-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-005-0198-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000237190200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

By contrast, fluctuating hydration regimes (FHR) consisting of cycles between dehydrating and benign conditions have been less comprehensively researched. Hypothetically, either repeated stress accumulates damage and reduces survival, or the recovery periods may act as a protective mechanism by allowing low temperature- or dehydration-induced damage to be repaired. Using false codling moth (Thaumatotibia leucotreta) larvae, we investigated whether FTR and FHR resulted in protection, or accumulated damage, at the cellular and whole-organism levels. Time- and age-matched controls were used to verify that the effects were due to the fluctuating stressors and not age- or time-dependent responses. Results showed that larval body water-(BWC) and lipid content (BLC) remained unchanged in response to FTR. Importantly though, FTR are protective when compared to constant low temperature exposures, potentially due to an increase in heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). However, larvae may suffer long-term fitness consequences compared to constant benign exposures. Results for FHR appear equivocal when compared to constant controls, due to high survival rates for all experiments, although the physiological responses to FHR included a decrease in larval BWC and BLC, a decrease in cuticular water loss rates, and a depletion of HSP70 during the final dehydration cycle. In conclusion, it appears that fluctuating stressors are protective in T. leucotreta when compared to constant stress conditions, likely through regulation of whole-animal metabolic rate and HSP70, although other mechanisms (e.g. ion homeostasis) are also implicated.

Mating in flying squirrels begins in late winter, at a time when squirrels tend to thermoregulate socially (i.e. they huddle in communal nests for warmth). We tested the hypothesis that the proximate cause of hybridization was a requirement for social thermoregulation that would lead squirrels at the range periphery to nest socially with heterospecifics. We conducted a captive preference experiment with pairs of same-sex, wild-caught flying squirrels to test the relative frequency of conspecific and heterospecific nesting. Contrary to our expectations, ambient temperature did not predict the willingness of squirrels to thermoregulate socially. Instead, G. volans nested as a conspecific pair in all trials, whereas G. sabrinus nested in conspecific pairs less often than G. volans. Heterospecific pairs occurred less often than conspecific pairs of either species. A low level of heterospecific social nesting occurred in all conditions and at all times of year, however, suggesting that the behaviour of social nesting is not a perfect reproductive barrier and might lead to some opportunities for hybridization.",,,,,"Bowman, Jeff/B-4147-2009; Burness, Gary/ABB-4937-2020","Bowman, Jeff/0000-0002-1892-4469; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-4066,1095-8312,,,,APR,2018,123,4,,,,,805,813,,10.1093/biolinnean/bly014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biolinnean/bly014,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000429470400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the case of November (a representative for the winter season from October to March), southward currents of velocity 0.1-0.3 in s(-1) occur along the bottom contours off the east of Sakhalin Island. The currents are mostly confined to the shelf (shallower than 200 in) and extend as far south as the Hokkaido coast. In the July case (a representative for the summer season from April to September), significant currents do not occur, even in the shallow shelves. The simulated southward current over the east Sakhalin shelf appears to correspond to the near-shore branch of the East Sakhalin Current (ESC), which was observed with the surface drifters. These seasonal variations simulated in our experiments are consistent with the observations of the ESC. Dynamically, the simulated ESC is interpreted as the arrested topographic wave (ATW), which is the coastally trapped flow driven by steady alongshore wind stress.

Reaction norms depict the environmental effects on phenotypic traits and are used to predict the global change consequences on species distributions. However, studies performed at constant temperatures have limited ecological significance because expressed phenotypes depend on the range and frequency of environmental states. 2. Using Jensen's inequality (i.e. a mathematical property of nonlinear functions), we predicted that the effect of thermal fluctuations on the phenotype depends on the shape of the reaction norm. Thermal fluctuations around the optimal temperature are expected to reduce the phenotypic trait values, especially for specialists because of their narrower reaction norms. 3. This study measured the effects of diel fluctuations in developmental temperature on phenotypic expression of traits related to fitness and energetic resources in two strains of the parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens from different habitats: a thermal generalist strain and a specialist one. In a first experiment, we compared the effect of constant thermal regimes versus fluctuating ones having the same means (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) on reaction norms of life-history traits and of energetic reserves. In a second experiment, we examined the effects of a natural thermoperiod in the field on these traits. 4. Our results show that the shape of the reaction norm defines the phenotypic changes induced by the development under fluctuating thermal conditions. These results match the predictions of the Jensen's inequality. Moreover, our results emphasize the significance of taking into account several phenotypic life-history traits to study the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity. We also show that the level of energetic resources depends on the mean developmental temperature and not on the thermal regime. Finally, the field experiment confirms that the phenotype of these parasitoids depends on the temperature variation. 5.

It has been reported that Pinus koraiensis Siebold & Zucc., one of the representative pine trees of Liaoning Province, has been infected by PWNs. To investigate the pathogenicity of the PWN in P. koraiensis, the reproductive ability of PWNs on fungal culture was compared among three isolates: QH-1, NM-1, and CM-1 (QH-1 from Liaoning Province, NM-1 from Nanjing Province, and CM-1 from Chongqing Municipality). Four-year-old P. koraiensis seedlings were inoculated with QH-1, NM-1, and CM-1 at a rate of 2000 per seedling. Pathogenicity, external symptoms, and nematode migration were all monitored on a daily basis over the next few days. The results from the experiment showed that all three PWN isolates caused wilt in P. koraiensis seedlings, with QH-1 being more virulent than NM-1 and CM-1. In addition, QH-1 exhibited greater reproductive and migration abilities in the seedlings than NM-1 and CM-1. These results indicate that the virulence of the B. xylophilus isolates QH-1, NM-1, and CM-1 can differ in terms of seedling mortality, migration ability, and reproductive ability (in trees).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1999-4907,,,,AUG,2022,13,8,,,,,,,1197,10.3390/f13081197,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13081197,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000846197400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet its sensitivity to measure welfare of ad libitum-fed farm animals (that presumably have little or no energy allocation constraints) remains largely untested. This study was conducted to examine whether FA is sensitive to experimentally induced stress in broiler chickens and whether effect sizes differ between emotional and physical stressors. Broiler chickens were randomly assigned to emotional stress treatments (pain or frustration), physical stress treatments (wet litter or high temperature and density), or no stress treatment (control). Both physical stressors, unlike the emotional stressors, were known to affect a number of conventional welfare indicators measured at slaughter age. Left-right asymmetry of 14 bilateral traits was measured at slaughter age and compared between treatments. Seven of the 14 bilateral traits proved unsuitable for the study of FA, either due to the presence of directional asymmetry or high measurement error. Fluctuating asymmetry tended to be lowest in the control group and highest in the high temperature and density treatment. However, either when modeling traits as repeated measures at individual broiler level or when performing trait-by-trait analysis, no significant differences D between treatments were detected. This negative result may indicate that FA is not a suitable indicator to detect variations of welfare status in fast-growing broiler chickens because of strong past selection for increased BW and improved feed efficiency, which can mask additional stress effects on developmental processes. Alternatively, FA is not a sensitive indicator of welfare in ad libitumfed animals because of absence of energy allocation constraints.

Although the qualitative composition of the grain is genetically determined, the quantitative composition is significantly modified by growing conditions, and there are important management x genotype x environment interactions. We recently reported a model of grain N accumulation and partitioning for wheat grain. The main assumptions made in this model are: (1) the accumulation of structural/metabolic proteins (albumins-globulins and amphiphils) is sink-driven and is a function of temperature; (2) the accumulation of storage proteins (gliadins and glutenins) is supply limited; (3) on the one hand the allocation of structural/metabolic proteins between albumin-globulin and amphiphilic protein fractions and on the other hand the allocation of storage protein between gliadin and glutenin fractions during grain growth is constant. A modified version of this grain model has been coupled with a revised version of the wheat simulation model Sirius99, allowing us to analyze the interactions between the vegetative sources and the reproductive sinks for N at the crop level. The main modifications to Sirius99 concerned the post-anthesis N uptake and remobilisation. After anthesis, the potential rate of crop N uptake was assumed to decrease linearly with accumulated thermal time, and the actual rate of N uptake was limited by the capacity of the stem to store accumulated N. During grain filling the daily rate of N transfer to grain was calculated daily according to the current crop N-status. The coupled model (SiriusQuality1) simulated dynamics of total grain N and of the different grain protein fractions reasonably well. At maturity, measured total grain N ranged from 0.56 to 1.32 mg N grain(-1), and the observed and simulated total grain N were well correlated (r(2) = 0.82, slope = 1.08) with a mean error of prediction of 0.11 mg N grain(-1). The simulated kinetics of crop N accumulation and stem N were closer to the observations with SiriusQuality1 than with Sirius99, in particular during the reproductive stage. At maturity, simulated and observed quantities of albumins-globulins were poorly correlated (r(2) = 0.02). Over the 18 experimental cases studied here, the quantity of storage proteins varied more than three-fold, and the observed and simulated quantities of gliadins and glutenins were well correlated (r(2) = 0.79 and 0.72, respectively). The simulations of total N and storage proteins accumulation provided by SiriusQuality1 confirmed that accumulation of grain N is overall source-rather than sink-regulated, at least under non-luxury N conditions. SiriusQuality1 provides a simple mechanistic framework that explains environmental effects on grain protein concentration and composition. The next step is to incorporate genetically related model parameters that will portray genotypic differences in protein concentration and composition. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Following its commissioning in 1999, algal blooms (dominated first by Phormidium and later Didymosphenia geminata) downstream of the dam were attributed to the reduced frequency and magnitude of high-flow events. In this study, we used a 20-year monitoring dataset to quantify changes associated with the dam. We also studied the effectiveness of flushing flows to remove periphyton from the river bed. Following the completion of the dam, daily maximum flows downstream have exceeded 100 m(3) s(-1) only three times; two of these floods exceeded the pre-dam mean annual flood of 203 m(3) s(-1) (compared to 19 times > 100 m(3) s(-1) and 6 times > 203 m(3) s(-1) in the 8 years of record before the dam). Other changes downstream included increases in water temperature, bed armoring, frequency of algal blooms, and changes to the aquatic invertebrate community. Seven experimental flushing flows resulted in limited periphyton reductions. Flood wave attenuation, bed armoring, and a shortage of surface sand and gravel, likely limited the effectiveness of these moderate floods. Floods similar to pre-dam levels may be effective for control of periphyton downstream; however, flushing flows of that magnitude are not possible with the existing dam infrastructure. These results highlight the need for dams to be planned and built with the capacity to provide the natural range of flows for adaptive management, particularly high flows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0364-152X,,,,,FEB,2013,51,2,,,,,459,473,,10.1007/s00267-012-9971-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-012-9971-x,,,,,,,,23124551,,,,,WOS:000314311300013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experimental investigations on a bus stop structure have been conducted for both climatic conditions (summer and winter) in Surat, Gujarat, India. The passive cooling effects considered were the tree shading effects on the east wall due to three trees immediately next to the east wall of the structure. It was found that the experimental data were in good agreement (an error of +/- 7.34 %) with results of a mathematical model developed for analysis of this passive cooling impact in the urban area. The result indicates that trees constitute an excellent passive cooling method for controlling the effect of direct sunshine on bus stop structure. It also reduce the cooling load of the structure and offer a significant advantage over artificial sunscreens, double glazed windows and roof insulation. However, findings also showed that alone this passive cooling option cannot maintain thermal comfort during hot summer.

Bivalvia (Corbicula fluminalis, Dreissena polymorpha, Anodonta cygnea, Unio pictorum), Prosobranchia (Viviparus viviparus), Crustacea (Gammaridae) and Diptera (Chironomidae) were the prevailing taxa of the benthic community, both in density and biomass. An original method based on multivariate analyses and a clustering approach was developed to describe the habitat mosaic in terms of substrate-type frequencies. The biomass of each taxon was recalculated for each substrate-type. The dissolved oxygen uptake and the filtration rate of the prevailing taxa of the benthic community were modelled using results of laboratory experiments. Both effects of water temperature and trophic level conditions were taken into account. Evaluations showed that benthic compartment respiration processes may have reach up to 25% of the total amount of dissolved oxygen per day, in the river Mosel. Furthermore, the macrobenthic compartment may have a great impact on phytoplankton communities, and then on primary production, by filtration activity. Indeed, the water volume daily filtered by filter-feeder macroinvertebrates potentially ranged from 26.9 to 83.8% of the total volume of a sector, in summer conditions.

By using sediment resources, benthic charophytes can achieve high biomasses and high metabolic rates. Pond metabolism reflected the physiology of the dominant charophyte, with light-saturated photosynthesis occurring during 55% of the light hours.

The high rainfall variability and limited planting opportunities in these regions make crop production risky. A robust crop simulation model can assist farmer decision-making via simulation analyses to quantify production risks. Accordingly, we developed a simple, yet mechanistic crop simulation model for sorghum for use in assessing climatic risk to production in water-limited environments. The model simulates grain yield, biomass accumulation, crop leaf area, phenology and soil water balance. The model uses a daily time-step and readily available weather and soil information and assumes no nutrient limitation. The model was tested on numerous data (n = 38) from experiments spanning a broad range of environments in the semi-arid tropics and subtropics. Potential limitations in the model were identified and examined in a novel testing procedure by using combinations of predicted and observed data in various modules of the model. The model performed satisfactorily, accounting for 94% and 64% of the variation in total biomass and grain yield, respectively. The difference in outcome for biomass and yield was caused by limitations in predicting harvest index.

The present study investigates the dynamic thermal response of a FHS exposed to a simulated direct solar radiation that is localized on its upper surface to quantify the potential effects of this exposure and identify the subsequent control issues of the FHS. Three experimental test scenarios were examined by varying the location of the sun patch and its duration. The experimental results show that the tested FHS, primarily regulated by controlling the indoor ambient air temperature, experiences a deficient regulation of the indoor temperature, which leads to an overheating period depending on the sun patch intensity and duration. An overheating of 4 degrees C compared with the recommended maximum desired value was recorded for duration of approximately 11.5 h after the sun patch was turned-off.

The warming treatment raised the plot daily temperature by ca. 1 degrees C, while the drought treatment led to a reduction in soil moisture at the peak of the growing season that ranged from 26% at the SP site to 82% in the NL site. During the 7 years the experiment lasted (1999-2005), we used the pin-point method to measure the species composition of plant communities and plant biomass, litterfall, and shoot growth of the dominant plant species at each site. A significantly lower increase in the number of species pin-pointed per transect was found in the drought plots at the SP site, where the plant community was still in a process of recovering from a forest fire in 1994. No changes in species richness were found at the other sites, which were at a more mature and stable state of succession and, thus less liable to recruitment of new species. The relationship between annual biomass accumulation and temperature of the growing season was positive at the coldest site and negative at the warmest site. The warming treatment tended to increase the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) at the northern sites. The relationship between annual biomass accumulation and soil moisture during the growing season was not significant at the wettest sites, but was positive at the driest sites. The drought treatment tended to reduce the ANPP in the NL, HU, IT, and SP sites. The responses to warming were very strongly related to the Gaussen aridity index (stronger responses the lower the aridity), whereas the responses to drought were not. Changes in the annual aboveground biomass accumulation, litterfall, and, thus, the ANPP, mirrored the interannual variation in climate conditions: the most outstanding change was a decrease in biomass accumulation and an increase in litterfall at most sites during the abnormally hot year of 2003. Species richness also tended to decrease in 2003 at all sites except the cold and wet UK site. Species-specific responses to warming were found in shoot growth: at the SP site, Globularia alypum was not affected, while the other dominant species, Erica multiflora, grew 30% more; at the UK site, Calluna vulgaris tended to grow more in the warming plots, while Empetrum nigrum tended to grow less. Drought treatment decreased plant growth in several studied species, although there were some species such as Pinus halepensis at the SP site or C. vulgaris at the UK site that were not affected. The magnitude of responses to warming and drought thus depended greatly on the differences between sites, years, and species and these multiple plant responses may be expected to have consequences at ecosystem and community level. Decreases in biodiversity and the increase in E. multiflora growth at the SP site as a response to warming challenge the assumption that sensitivity to warming may be less well developed at more southerly latitudes; likewise, the fact that one of the studied shrublands presented negative ANPP as a response to the 2003 heat wave also challenges the hypothesis that future climate warming will lead to an enhancement of plant growth and carbon sequestration in temperate ecosystems. Extreme events may thus change the general trend of increased productivity in response to warming n the colder sites.",,,,,"De Angelis, Paolo/A-6863-2012; Emmett, Bridget A/D-6199-2011; Schmidt, Inger K/A-6230-2015; Sowerby, Alwyn/AAW-8847-2020; Cesaraccio, Carla/C-1515-2015; Llorens, Laura/L-8732-2014; Beier, Claus/C-1789-2016; Riis-Nielsen, Torben/E-4527-2015; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Llorens, Laura/ABH-2383-2020; Beier, Claus/E-6288-2013; Pellizzaro, Grazia/C-5172-2015; Estiarte, Marc/G-2001-2016; de Dato, Giovanbattista D./F-9693-2014","De Angelis, Paolo/0000-0001-8310-8831; Emmett, Bridget A/0000-0002-2713-4389; Schmidt, Inger K/0000-0003-3880-2060; Cesaraccio, Carla/0000-0002-1642-4663; Llorens, Laura/0000-0001-9190-5144; Beier, Claus/0000-0003-0348-7179; Riis-Nielsen, Torben/0000-0001-5866-8810; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Llorens, Laura/0000-0001-9190-5144; Pellizzaro, Grazia/0000-0003-0860-897X; Estiarte, Marc/0000-0003-1176-8480; de Dato, Giovanbattista D./0000-0003-0289-1727; Sirca, Costantino/0000-0001-7605-5700; Spano, Donatella/0000-0002-5661-0241",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,,,,,DEC,2007,13,12,,,,,2563,2581,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01464.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01464.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000251049000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of this study was to map the 500-m, 8-day average and daily soil moisture at different soil depths in Oklahoma from remotely sensed and ground-measured data using the random forest (RF) method, which is one of the machine-learning approaches. In order to investigate the estimation accuracy of the RF method at both a spatial and a temporal scale, two independent soil moisture estimation experiments were conducted using data from 2010 to 2014: a year-to-year experiment (with a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.038 to 0.050 m(3)/m(3)) and a station-to-station experiment (with an RMSE ranging from 0.044 to 0.057 m(3)/m(3)). Then, the data requirements, importance factors, and spatial and temporal variations in estimation accuracy were discussed based on the results using the training data selected by iterated random sampling.

A stress damages the photosynthetic apparatus of SD and their thylakoid membranes, and symbiotic alga cells disappear via exocytosis and/or apoptosis resulting in a disturbance of host cell membranes. Lipids play an essential role in coral metabolism and constitute the basis of membranes. At present, studies of coral bleaching typically deal with long-term lipid indices, such as total lipids and fatty acids (FM), while short-term dynamics of lipidome (full range of all lipid molecular species) has not been considered in the context of bleaching mechanism. To evaluate the lipidomic approach to characterizing coral bleaching, the soft coral Sinularia sp. was exposed to a short-term experimental thermal stress (33 degrees C). The dynamics of chlorophyll level, the composition of total FAs, the amounts of total lipids and major lipid classes (such as wax esters (WE), triacylglycerols (TAG), and monoalkyldiacylglycerols (MADAG), glycolipids, ethanolamine-, choline-, serine-, inositolglycerophospholipids (PE, PC, PS, PI), and ceramide aminoethylphosphonate (CAEP)) and the variations in the content of lipid molecular species were studied during a 36-h heat exposure. > 160 molecular species were identified by tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry. Under the short-term stress, a considerable decline in the levels of chlorophylls, glycolipids, and FA markers of SD was detected, whereas the variations in the content of total lipids, total phospholipids, and major FAs were not significant. The heat exposure immediately disturbed the daily cycle of the composition of glycolipid molecular species. Among the storage lipids, the content of TAG and MADAG decreased, whereas the content of polyunsaturated WE molecular species increased under the stress. The following effects were recorded for the structural lipids: a depletion in the PE, PC, and PI amounts, a conversion of PE into their lyso and oxidized derivatives, an appearance of diacyl form of PE, and a disturbance of transfer of some polyunsaturated FAs from SD to the host. The content of PS was relatively stable. Probably, PE molecular species are a primary target of thermal stress in the Sinularia host. The most dramatical changes in the Sinularia lipidome were detected between 24 h and 36 h of the exposure. A lipidomic approach is important for studies of dynamics of the coral symbiotic association and a resistance of different coral taxa during short-term bleaching events.",,,,,"Sikorskaya, Tatyana V./AAS-9005-2020; Ermolenko, Ekaterina V/S-1562-2017; Imbs, Andrey B/K-2869-2018","Sikorskaya, Tatyana V./0000-0003-1204-4433; Imbs, Andrey B/0000-0001-6061-5857; Ermolenko, Ekaterina/0000-0002-0309-3033",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,MAR,2020,524,,,,,,,,151295,10.1016/j.jembe.2019.151295,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2019.151295,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000514018900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experimental high temperature was 36degrees, while 27degrees was the moderate temperature at which individuals were kept when not exposed to the high temperature. In three experiments, larvae and pupae were subjected either to constant exposure to 36degrees initiated at various developmental stages or to fluctuating temperatures (daily high-temperature pulses of 6 or 12 hours) throughout development. In general, we found that increasing lengths of constant exposure resulted in increasingly higher mortality, longer development time, and lighter adult mass, while daily temperature fluctuations resulted in very little mortality and shorter development times. Mortality, development time, and adult size were affected differently by the initiation of high-temperature treatment at the various stages of development. Because faster development is likely to be beneficial to Monarchs, certain high-temperature regimes that allow for shortened time to adulthood may not be as detrimental to larvae and pupae as previously was assumed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-8567,,,,,OCT,2002,75,4,,,,,290,298,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000179666000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Novel feed binders from soybean hulls (SBH) were developed to further improve water stability of the compound feed. Three (SBH)-based binders were evaluated as binding agent (2%) against three natural control binders (carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), corn starch (CS) and wheat glucan (WG)) with respect to water stability and nutrient leaching after being immersed in water up to 48 h at two water temperatures (22 ? and 28 ?). Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei (mean weight of 6.08 +/- 0.04 g) were fed in triplicate aquaria with the experimental diets at a rate of 4% of body weight per day, four times daily, for 6 weeks in a recirculating water system. Diets with SHB had significantly improved pellet water stability compared to the diets with control binders (CS and WG) after being immersed in water for longer than 12 h. CMC had the poorest water stability at 3 h and longer water immersion. Recovery of pellets with soybean hull binders was significantly higher than the pellets with control binders at 24 h of water immersion. After 48 h of water immersion, only diets with SHB were recovered ranging from 30% to 40%. Increasing water temperature resulted in a corresponding decrease in water stability of all pellets. At higher water temperature, however, water stability of pellets with control binders were significantly lower compared to pellets with SHB. The binder that best retained crude protein in all time periods was SHB-3. However, it was not significantly different from other soybean hull binders. Percent lipid remained unchanged in all leached pellets up to 12 h of water immersion and increased afterward. Percent ash of the leached pellets increased at 3 h of immersion and continued to increase with the increasing period of water immersion. Diets with SHB retained higher nutrients than the diets containing control binders after being immersed in water 3 h or longer. Weight gain and survival of shrimp fed diets with control or SHB for 6 weeks were not significantly influenced by binder type. In summary, the SBH-bound pellets were more water stable than the control binders and can produce better and be less expensive natural alternatives to conventional binders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0377-8401,1873-2216,,,,JUN,2022,288,,,,,,,,115292,10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.115292,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.115292,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000798823000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many satellite-based methods for fire detection and monitoring have been developed to exploit data acquired by sensors onboard polar orbiting platforms. Their relatively low temporal resolution (hours) is, however, decidedly not adequate for detecting short-living events or fires characterised by a marked diurnal cycle and rapid evolution times. Geostationary satellites have very high temporal resolution of 30 to 2.5 min and could, in principle, be more suitable for providing timely alerts and facilitating possible mitigation actions. However, such short revisit times are coupled with spatial resolutions of 3-5 km; which are coarser than those of the polar orbiting sensors generally having 1 km capability in the infrared region. This could represent a significant limitation for small fire detection and precise localization. However, unlike polar orbiting systems, the geostationary attitude assures very stable observational conditions at the pixel level, including fixed view angles, same time of day, and same ground resolution cell dimensions. This can be crucial for fire-detection methods based on multi-temporal analyses. This work describes in detail the Robust Satellite Techniques for FIRES detection and monitoring (RST-FIRES), a multi-temporal change-detection technique, and its application to the data of Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) on board the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) platform. Its performance in terms of reliability and sensitivity was verified by >20,000 SEVIRI images collected throughout the day during a four-year -collaboration with the regional Civil Protection Departments and other Local Authorities of two Italian regions which provided about 950 near real-time ground and aerial checks of the RST-FIRES detections. The results indicate a mean commission error rate of 18%, ranging from 3% to 30% according to the specific experimental campaign, with an average omission error of 44%, ranging from 3% to 66% depending on the campaign and the validation source used. This study fully demonstrates the added value of the RST-FIRES technique for the early warning of fire events. During the considered validation campaigns, RST-FIRES provided the sole fire alert in 348 cases; in further 227 cases, its warnings were given >1 h before any other source of information was provided. Finally, this paper presents and discusses a comparison among RST-FIRES and other SEVIRI-based fire detection products. On the whole, RST-FIRES is shown to be 3 to 70 times more sensitive than all of the other considered SEVIRI-based products. This satisfactory result was not completely unexpected, considering the quite high false positive rate exhibited by RST-FIRES and the fact that other algorithms were designed to work in a wider area, from continental to the SEVIRI full disk.

We tested predictions that birds in arid habitats should express fine-scale variation in their thermoregulatory patterns as a function of prevailing climatic conditions. We assessed effects of air temperature (T-air) and water vapor pressure deficit (D) on body temperature (T-b) in free-living White-browed Sparrow-Weavers (Plocepasser mahali) during summer in two arid habitats in the Kalahari Desert, South Africa, using data from a dry period at a hot, desert site (n = 7 birds), and during a dry period (n = 4 birds) and a wet period (n = 5 birds) at a milder, semi-desert site. The desert birds maintained a significantly higher set-point T-b (41.5 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C, mean +/- SD) than semi-desert birds (40.2 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C). During the warmest part of day (12:00-18:00 hours), T-b increased significantly during periods of high Tair and/or high humidity, and mean and maximum T-b were up to 1.48 and 2.3 degrees C, respectively, above normal levels. However, as Tair increased, birds at the desert site maintained T-b at or below set-point levels for a greater proportion of the time than birds at the semi-desert site. Birds at the desert site also expressed a greater magnitude of daily heterothermy (heterothermy index, HI = 2.4 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C, mean +/- SD) than birds at the semi-desert site: the latter population showed a greater magnitude of heterothermy during a dry period (HI = 2.1 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C) than during a wet period (HI = 1.6 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C). Birds continued foraging throughout the warmest part of the day, despite the fact that heat dissipation (percentage of time spent panting and wing-spreading) increased significantly with increasing T-air. Our findings reveal that populations can vary in their thermoregulatory responses in both space and time and suggest that small changes in Tair can have significant effects on thermoregulation in free-ranging desert birds, even when T-air < T-b. These data have important implications for assessing vulnerability of species to climate change, suggesting that sensitivity should be assessed at the population, rather than species, level.",,,,,"Smit, Ben/D-9466-2011; Smit, Ben/AAO-4778-2020","Smit, Ben/0000-0003-4160-8242; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,MAY,2013,94,5,,,,,1142,1154,,10.1890/12-1511.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-1511.1,,,,,,,,23858654,,,,,WOS:000318969800016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here an evaluation of the ERA-Interim-driven EURO-CORDEX regional climate model (RCM) ensemble is presented. The study documents the performance of the individual models in representing the basic spatiotemporal patterns of the European climate for the period 1989-2008. Model evaluation focuses on near-surface air temperature and precipitation, and uses the E-OBS data set as observational reference. The ensemble consists of 17 simulations carried out by seven different models at grid resolutions of 12 km (nine experiments) and 50 km (eight experiments). Several performance metrics computed from monthly and seasonal mean values are used to assess model performance over eight subdomains of the European continent. Results are compared to those for the ERA40-driven ENSEMBLES simulations. The analysis confirms the ability of RCMs to capture the basic features of the European climate, including its variability in space and time. But it also identifies nonnegligible deficiencies of the simulations for selected metrics, regions and seasons. Seasonally and regionally averaged temperature biases are mostly smaller than 1.5 degrees C, while precipitation biases are typically located in the +/- 40% range. Some bias characteristics, such as a predominant cold and wet bias in most seasons and over most parts of Europe and a warm and dry summer bias over southern and southeastern Europe reflect common model biases. For seasonal mean quantities averaged over large European subdomains, no clear benefit of an increased spatial resolution (12 vs. 50 km) can be identified. The bias ranges of the EURO-CORDEX ensemble mostly correspond to those of the ENSEMBLES simulations, but some improvements in model performance can be identified (e. g., a less pronounced southern European warm summer bias). The temperature bias spread across different configurations of one individual model can be of a similar magnitude as the spread across different models, demonstrating a strong influence of the specific choices in physical parameterizations and experimental setup on model performance. Based on a number of simply reproducible metrics, the present study quantifies the currently achievable accuracy of RCMs used for regional climate simulations over Europe and provides a quality standard for future model developments.",,,,,"Goergen, Klaus/A-4655-2017; Gobiet, Andreas/AAX-2537-2020; Gobiet, Andreas/AAF-6039-2020; Vautard, Robert/ABF-9489-2020; Christensen, Ole B/E-4417-2013; Teichmann, Claas/J-1149-2014; Schar, Christoph/A-1033-2008; Colette, Augustin/G-9751-2011","Goergen, Klaus/0000-0002-4208-3444; Gobiet, Andreas/0000-0001-5751-2961; Teichmann, Claas/0000-0003-2478-7074; Schar, Christoph/0000-0002-4171-1613; Warrach-Sagi, Kirsten/0000-0003-2572-8527; Colette, Augustin/0000-0002-0162-0098",,,,,,,,,,,,,1991-959X,1991-9603,,,,,2014,7,4,,,,,1297,1333,,10.5194/gmd-7-1297-2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-7-1297-2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000341603900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

A.; Kregting, Louise",,,Marine heat waves differentially affect functioning of native (Ostrea edulis) and invasive (Crassostrea [Magallana] gigas) oysters in tidal pools,MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"The frequency and duration of short-term extreme climatic events, such as marine heat waves (MHWs), are increasing worldwide. The rapid onset of MHWs can lead to short-term stress responses in organisms that may have lethal or sub-lethal effects. In addition, increased temperature variability and extremes are predicted to favour and facilitate the spread of non-native species, altering rates of key ecosystem processes and functions. It is possible, however, that compensatory mechanisms, such as increased feeding rates, may enable the maintenance of metabolic functioning and prevent detrimental temperature effects. Using a mesocosm-based approach, we experimentally tested for the effects of MHWs in tidal pools on the mortality, individual length, width and biomass, and respiration rates for both a native oyster, Ostrea edulis, and invasive oyster, Magallana gigas, with or without food supply. No mortality was recorded for either O. edulis or M. gigas for the duration of the four week experiment. Increases in length were greater in O. edulis compared to M. gigas but were not affected by temperature or food supply. Increases in width, however, did not differ between species but were reduced overall in heat wave treatments regardless of food supply. O. edulis gained more biomass than M. gigas in ambient treatments regardless of food supply but, in heat wave treatments, only gained greater biomass than M. gigas at additional levels of food supply. Respiration rates did not reflect changes in temperature or food supply in either species but differed through time, with greater rates post-heat wave in all treatments. Thermal responses of O. edulis and M. gigas to MHWs thus appear to be context dependent and, if food supply is sufficient, O. edulis may be able to maintain its presence in the intertidal. The ability of M. gigas to remain unaffected by fluctuating environmental conditions, however, suggests future resilience of invasive populations to climatic extremes that may result in competitive exclusion and a further decline in native oyster populations. This information is critical for developing effective management plans to ensure the sustainability of natural oyster populations whilst maintaining key ecosystem functioning.",,,,,"Coughlan, Neil E/AAT-1760-2020","Coughlan, Neil E/0000-0001-5597-3238; Gilson, Abby/0000-0003-4607-1376",,,,,,,,,,,,,0141-1136,1879-0291,,,,DEC,2021,172,,,,,,,,105497,10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.105497,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.105497,,OCT 2021,,,,,,34656016,,,,,WOS:000707671900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dry matter intake (DMI) (p = 0.069, tendency) and blood glucose levels (p = 0.028) were decreased after sudden exposure to HS conditions (severe THI levels).

In this type of window, the exhaust air passes through the air cavity between the glass panes before being released to the outdoor environment. Part of the heat or cold energy inherent in the exhaust air can be recovered. The temperature differential between the interior surface of window and indoor air can be directly reduced, which would benefit the indoor thermal comfort. To investigate the dynamic thermal behavior of the triple-glazed exhaust air window, an improved zonal model was built and validated by using the on-site experimental data. Temperature distributions of this window in both vertical and horizontal directions were analyzed. The influences of the airflow velocity in ventilated cavity and the slat angle of venetian blinds on the thermal performance of the window on a typical summer day were quantitatively investigated. The U-values of this window under different airflow velocities were also calculated. Results show that the temperature differential between inner glass pane and indoor air varies from 0.5 degrees C to 2.6 degrees C, and shows a relatively low fluctuation throughout the whole day. The heat gain through the window can be reduced as high as 42.3% in the cooling season, when the airflow velocity varies from the 0.1 m/s to 0.5 m/s.

In this study we examined the combined role of herbivores and climate warming as drivers of CO2 fluxes in two typical high-latitude habitats (mesic heath and wet meadow). We hypothesized that both herbivory and climate warming would reduce the C sink strength of Arctic tundra through their combined effects on plant biomass and gross ecosystem photosynthesis and on decomposition rates and the abiotic environment. To test this hypothesis we employed experimental warming (via International Tundra Experiment [ITEX] chambers) and grazing (via captive Barnacle Geese) in a three-year factorial field experiment. Ecosystem CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem exchange of CO2, ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem photosynthesis) were measured in all treatments at varying intensity over the three growing seasons to capture the impact of the treatments on a range of temporal scales (diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Grazing and warming treatments had markedly different effects on CO2 fluxes in the two tundra habitats. Grazing caused a strong reduction in CO2 assimilation in the wet meadow, while warming reduced CO2 efflux from the mesic heath. Treatment effects on net ecosystem exchange largely derived from the modi. cation of gross ecosystem photosynthesis rather than ecosystem respiration. In this study we have demonstrated that on the habitat scale, grazing by geese is a strong driver of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, with the potential to reduce the CO2 sink strength of Arctic ecosystems. Our results highlight that the large reduction in plant biomass due to goose grazing in the Arctic noted in several studies can alter the C balance of wet tundra ecosystems. We conclude that herbivory will modulate direct climate warming responses of Arctic tundra with implications for the ecosystem C balance; however, the magnitude and direction of the response will be habitat-specific.",,,,,"van der Wal, Rene/F-3177-2010",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,AUG,2008,89,8,,,,,2103,2116,,10.1890/07-1601.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/07-1601.1,,,,,,,,18724721,,,,,WOS:000258236400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The transect was worked during the Austral spring period of November-December 1992, with stations in pack-ice (Gertie/Herbie), ice-edge (Isolde), and open-waters (Jules and Katie) of the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Microzooplankton varied in their abundance in the surface mixed layer within the MIZ transect by more than an order of magnitude. In the waters beneath the pack-ice, microzooplankton concentrations were low (ca 850 organisms I-1); they increased at the ice-edge station (2110 organisms I-1) and reached a maximum (ca 17,000 organisms I-1) at the open water situated ca 200 km north of the ice-edge. The community was dominated by Protozoa, which contributed > 97% of the numerical abundance of microzooplankton and > 89% of the standing stocks. Protozoan communities were dominated by naked oligotrich ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Microzooplankton biomass in the mixed layer of the MIZ varied between 0.2 and 54 mu g Cl-1, with the minimum situated at depth under the ice and maximum in open surface waters, respectively. Microzooplankton biomass was strongly correlated to ambient phytoplankton concentrations and averaged 24% of their biomass. Mixed layer standing stocks ranged between 50 and 2021 mgC m(-2) at the southern and northern stations, respectively. Microzooplankton herbivorous activity also showed strong latitudinal gradients across the MIZ. Microzooplankton herbivory, investigated using dilution experiments within surface mixed layers, was generally vigorous. Microzooplankton turned over between 3 and 40% of the phytoplankton daily, thereby consuming between 0.04 and 31.21 mu gC I-1 day(-1) in these experiments. The magnitude of this activity was positively related to sea-water temperature,lo phytoplankton concentration, and to the ambient microzooplankton concentrations. A multiple regression model of microzooplankton herbivory was developed to produce an integrated analysis of their impact on phytogenic carbon flux. Microzooplankton in the mixed layer were estimated to graze 21 and 3260 mg phytoplankton-C m(-2) day(-1) at the southern pack-ice and northern open-water stations, respectively.

Six phenological phases were reproduced daily according to the BBCH codes (00-89): emergence (00-09), leaf development (10-19), stem elongation (30-39), inflorescence emergence (50-59), flowering (60-69) and pod development-maturation period (70-89). The model takes into account temperature (including vernalisation) and photoperiod as the main environmental forces affecting crop phenology. The macro stages of leaf development and shooting were reproduced considering the rates of leaf appearance and internode extension. Model calibration and validation were performed using an extensive database of phenological observations collected from several experimental sites across France (n=144), Germany (n=839) and Italy (n=577). The stability of the parameterisation was checked by a cross-calibration procedure. Applied to the independent datasets used for validation and cross-validation, the model was able to predict the whole-crop cycle with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.8 and 3.2 BBCH stages, respectively. Particularly accurate predictions of winter OSR development were obtained with the Italian datasets (RMSE: 2.1 and 2.3 BBCH stages for validation and cross-validation, respectively).

Feces samples (n = 864) from chickens (n = 36) with naturally occurring mixed nematode infections (trials N1, N2) or with an experimental Ascaridia gall infection (E) were collected quantitatively every 4h for four consecutive days. Number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) was determined, and accumulative egg output (AEO) at each sampling time as well as total number of eggs excreted within 24h (eggs per day, EPD) were then estimated. At the end of the collection period, the hens were necropsied and their worm burdens determined. Naturally infected hens harbored Heterakis gallinarum (100%), Capillaria spp. (95.7%) and A. galli (91.3%). The experimental A. galli infection produced patent infections in all the birds. In general, both fecal egg concentration (EPG) and the amount of feces increased (P < 0.05) sharply from the early morning to early-noon (10:00 a.m.) and remained at a high level until evenings which thereafter decreased to their initial levels during the night both in naturally and experimentally infected birds. This resulted in a more apparent increase or a decrease in AEO at the corresponding time points, respectively, and led to much higher egg excretions during the daytime than the nights. Despite the apparent within day fluctuations in egg excretion, neither EPG (P = 0.704) nor AEO (P = 0.499) nor EPD (P = 0.149) was significantly different among the four collection days. Similarly, there was no significant interaction (P > 0.05) between effects of sampling hours and days on EPG and AEO, suggesting the existence of repeatable diurnal fluctuations within each day. Although an association between climatic parameters (e.g., ambient temperature and relative humidity) and the nematode egg excretion was quantified, a causal relationship could not be demonstrated. We conclude that nematode egg excretion through chicken feces in both natural and experimental infections shows repeatable diurnal fluctuations, which may indicate adaptive strategies by nematodes and eventually favor parasite spread. Since analytic sensitivity of fecal egg counts suffers from low egg concentrations in feces, samples taken during the daytime have a higher diagnostic value. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Of particular importance is the cellular sensitivity and response to periodic driving forces in noisy environments, encountered in vital physiological conditions such as heart beating, blood vessel pulsation and breathing. Here, we first test and validate two predictions of a mean-field theory of cellular reorientation under periodic driving, which combines the minimization of cellular anisotropic elastic energy with active remodeling forces. We then extend the mean-field theory to include uncorrelated, additive nonequilibrium fluctuations, and show that the theory quantitatively agrees with the experimentally observed stationary probability distributions of the cell body orientation, under a range of biaxial periodic driving forces. The fluctuations theory allows the extraction of the dimensionless active noise amplitude of various cell types, and consequently their rotational diffusion coefficient. We then focus on intra-cellular nematic order, i.e. on orientational fluctuations of actin stress fibers around the cell body orientation, and show experimentally that intra-cellular nematic order increases with both the magnitude of the driving forces and the biaxiality strain ratio. These results are semi-quantitatively explained by applying the same cell body fluctuations theory to orientationally correlated actin stress fiber domains. Finally, an estimate of the energy scale of cellular orientational fluctuations for one cell type is shown to be about six order of magnitude larger than the thermal energy at room temperature.

Sustaining maximal canopy photosynthetic capacity after-flowering is, then, a necessary but not a sufficient condition to increase maize dry-matter production. The aim of the present study was to determine the extent of the photo-thermal environment limitation to CGR during the post-flowering period in current maize crops. Dynamic of CGR was studied in two well-irrigated and nourished maize field experiments (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2 for 2010 -11 and 2011 - 12 cropping seasons, respectively) on conventional crops (i.e. full-season hybrid planted early in the season) at Balcarce, Argentina (37 degrees 45' S, 58 degrees 18' W; 130 m a.s.l.). Two independent methods were performed to benchmark the CGR of these conventional crops during the post-flowering period: i) empirical CGR values obtained under the same weather conditions from younger maize crops, and ii) theoretically estimated potential CGR, obtained as a function of daily incident radiation and potential radiation use-efficiency (RUE). Conventional crops reached the maximal CGR near flowering in mid-January, being 51.2 g m(-2) d(-1) and 58.8 g m(-2) d(-1) in Exp. 1 and Exp. 2, respectively. Afterwards, CGR decreased progressively towards crops maturity late in March. Estimates, from either the empirical or the theoretical method, indicated that although attainable-CGR decreases progressively towards the end of the cropping season, it sustains higher values than those achieved by conventional crops after flowering. Differences in attainable vs. actual-CGR was almost exclusively attributable to RUE, which, in turn, could not be explained solely by the post-flowering foliar nitrogen withdrawal. Differences between actual (1987 g m(-2) in Exp. 1 and 1614 g m(-2) in Exp. 2) and potential post-flowering dry-matter production defined gaps that were in the range 18.2%-47.8%. From these results, it can be concluded that the photo-thermal environment is not, at least so far, the limiting factor to the post-flowering maize growth. Further research is needed, however, to analyze the viability of increasing potential yield of maize through the closure of these estimated gaps.",,,,,,"Olmedo Pico, Lia B./0000-0002-3140-2761; Monzon, Juan Pablo/0000-0001-6992-1842",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-4290,1872-6852,,,,JUL 1,2020,252,,,,,,,,107805,10.1016/j.fcr.2020.107805,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2020.107805,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000531082600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The pH-stat protein digestibility routine with shrimp hepatopancreas enzymes was previously related to apparent protein digestibility with juvenile Litopenaeus vannamei fed diets containing different protein ingredients. The potential of the method to predict culture performance of shrimp fed six commercial feeds (T3, T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8) with 350 g kg(-1) declared crude-protein content was assessed. The consistency of results obtained using hepatopancreas enzyme extracts from either pond or clear water-raised shrimp was further verified in terms of reproducibility and possible diet history effects upon in vitro outputs. Shrimps were previously acclimated and then maintained over 56 days (initial mean weight 3.28 g) on each diet in 500-L tanks at 114 ind m(-2), clear water closed system with continuous renewal and mechanical filtering (50 mu m), with four replicates per treatment. Feeds were offered four times daily (six days a week) delivered in trays at feeding rates ranging from 4.0% to 7.0% of stocked shrimp biomass. Feed was accessible to shrimp 4 h daily for 1-h feeding period after which uneaten feed was recovered. Growth and survival were determined every 14 days from a sample of 16 individuals per tank. Water quality was monitored daily (pH, temperature and salinity) and managed by water back flushing filter cleaning every 7-10 days. Feeds were analysed for crude protein, gross energy, amino acids and pepsin digestibility. In vitro pH-stat degree of protein hydrolysis (DH%) was determined for each feed using hepatopancreas enzyme extracts from experimental (clear water) or pond-raised shrimp. Feeds resulted in significant differences in shrimp performance (P < 0.05) as seen by the differences in growth rates (0.56-0.98 g week(-1)), final weight and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Shrimp performance and in vitro DH% with pond-raised shrimp enzymes showed significant correlation (P < 0.05) for yield (R-2 = 0.72), growth rates (R-2 = 0.72-0.80) and FCR (R-2 = -0.67). Other feed attributes (protein : energy ratio, amino acids, true protein, non-protein nitrogen contents and in vitro pepsin digestibility) showed none or limited correlation with shrimp culture performance. Additional correlations were found between growth rates and methionine (R-2 = 0.73), FCR and histidine (R-2 = -0.60), and DH% and methionine or methionine+cystine feed contents (R-2 = 0.67-0.92). pH-stat assays with shrimp enzymes generated reproducible DH% results with either pond (CV <= 6.5%) or clear water (CV <= 8.5%) hepatopancreas enzyme sources. Moreover, correlations between shrimp growth rates and feed DH% were significant regardless of the enzyme origin (pond or clear water-raised shrimp) and showed consistent R-2 values.

The final weight and weight gain of fish significantly increased with increasing dietary biotin up to 0.049 mg kg-1 diet (P < 0.05), and then slightly decreased. Both feed efficiency ratio and protein efficiency ratio showed a very similar change pattern to that of weight gain. Dietary treatments did not significantly affect carcass crude protein, crude lipid, moisture and ash content. However, liver biotin concentration (0-6.1 mu g g-1) significantly increased with the supplementation of dietary biotin (P < 0.05), and no tissue saturation was found within the supplementation scope of biotin.

Using a globally important model species, the blue mussel Mytilus, in a 5-week-long experiment, we (a) assessed growth performance traits under 12 scenarios, consisting of four thermal averages (18.5, 21, 23.5 and 26celcius) imposed as constant or daily fluctuating regimes with amplitudes of 2 or 4celcius. Additionally, we conducted a short-term assay using different mussel individuals to (b) test for the species capacity for suppression and recovery of metabolic performance traits (feeding and aerobic respiration) when exposed to a 1-day thermal fluctuation regime (16.8-30.5celcius). Using this high-resolution data, we (c) generated short-term thermal metabolic performance curves to predict and explain growth responses observed in the long-term experiment. We found that daily high-amplitude thermal cycles (4celcius) improved mussel growth when fluctuations were imposed around an extreme average temperature of 26celcius, representing end-of-century heatwaves. In contrast, thermal cycles negatively affected mussel growth at a less extreme average temperature of 23.5celcius, resembling current peak summer temperature scenarios. These results suggest that fluctuations ameliorate heat stress impacts only at critically high average temperatures. The short-term assay demonstrated that during the warming phase, animals stopped feeding between 24 and 30celcius while gradually suppressing respiration. In the subsequent cooling phase, feeding and respiration partially and fully recovered to pre-heating rates respectively. Furthermore, nonlinear averaging of short-term feeding responses (upscaling) well-predicted longer term growth responses to fluctuations. Our findings suggest that fluctuations can be beneficial to or detrimental for the long-term performance of ectothermic animals, depending on the fluctuations' average and amplitude. Furthermore, the observed effects can be linked to fluctuation-mediated metabolic suppression and recovery. In a general framework, we propose various hypothetical scenarios of fluctuation impacts on ectotherm performance considering inter- or intra-species variability in heat sensitivity.

At the same time, CHCs also serve as communication signals. To maintain waterproofing under different climate conditions, insects adjust the chemical composition of their CHC layer, but this may affect the communication via CHCs. The detailed acclimatory changes of CHCs and how these influence their physical properties are still unknown. Here, we studied acclimation in two closely related ant species with distinct CHC profiles, Myrmica rubra and Myrmica ruginodis, in response to constant or fluctuating temperature and humidity regimes. We measured how acclimation affected CHC composition and viscosity, and the ants' drought survival. In both species, CHC composition showed strong, predictable responses to temperature regimes. Warm-acclimated individuals had higher proportions of linear alkanes, and less methyl-branched or unsaturated CHCs. These changes coincided with higher solid content and viscosity of CHCs in warm-acclimated ants. Temperature fluctuation caused effects similar to those observed under constant-cool conditions in M. rubra, but led to entirely different profiles in M. ruginodis, suggesting that fluctuating and constant conditions pose very different challenges. Acclimation to dry conditions led to higher absolute amounts of CHCs, which increased the ants' drought survival, whereas temperature acclimation did not. Hence, the temperature-induced CHC changes cannot be explained by the need for waterproofing alone. Although these changes could be non-adaptive, we propose that they serve to maintain a constant CHC viscosity, which may be essential for communication and other functions.",,,,,"Sprenger, Philipp Peter/H-8787-2019; Menzel, Florian/H-2436-2017","Sprenger, Philipp Peter/0000-0003-0875-749X; Menzel, Florian/0000-0002-9673-3668",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAY,2018,221,9,,,,,,,jeb171488,10.1242/jeb.171488,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.171488,,,,,,,,29615527,,,,,WOS:000438911800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three pot experiments were then conducted to emulate the range of soil Mn2+ concentrations observed in the field and to determine the effect of different concentrations on lucerne and subterranean clover seedling growth, as well as to determine the effect of heating a soil on pH and Mn2+ concentrations. Concentrations of soil Mn2+ in the surface 0.20 m varied at a given sampling date by up to 288% (2.5-9.7 mu g/mL) and 183% (8.7-24.6 mu g/mL) across the Gerogery and Binalong field sites, respectively. At both sites, the concentration of soil Mn2+ in a given plot also varied by up to 175% between sampling times. There was little consistency between sites for seasonal fluctuations of soil Mn2+, although in both instances, peaks occurred during months in which newly sown lucerne plants might be emerging in southern NSW. Pot experiments revealed that high concentrations of soil Mn2+ reduced lucerne seedling survival by 35%, and on seedlings that did survive, reduced shoot growth by 19% and taproot length by 39%. Elevated concentrations of soil Mn2+ also reduced subterranean clover seedling survival by up to 55% and taproot length by 25%, although there were few effects on subterranean clover in treatments other than those imposing the highest soil Mn2+ concentrations.

The lack of an effect for Scots pine was ascribed to seedlings containing unusually large energy reserves that buffered respiratory expenditure of sugars. A strong, linear relationship between levels of cold hardiness, assessed by the electrolyte leakage method, and sugars was found when combining data from this and previous, similar experiments. In the second experiment, the evergreen dwarf shrub Empetrum hermaphroditum Hagerup was analysed for leaf cold hardiness, using the electrolyte leakage method, and sugar concentrations in late spring and late autumn during the third year of a warming experiment in a subarctic dwarf shrub community.

Developing a mechanistic understanding of the impacts of heat waves on key ecosystem processes and how they differ from just an increase in mean temperatures is therefore of utmost importance for adaptive management against effects of global change. However, little is known about the impact of extreme events on freshwater ecosystem processes, particularly the decomposition of macrophyte detritus. We performed a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the impact of warming and heat waves on macrophyte detrital decomposition, applied as a fixed increment (+4 degrees C) above ambient and a fluctuating treatment with similar energy input, ranging from 0 to 6 degrees C above ambient (i.e., simulating heat waves). We showed that both warming and heat waves significantly accelerate dry mass loss of the detritus and carbon (C) release but found no significant differences between the two heated treatments on the effects on detritus dry mass loss and C release amount. This suggests that moderate warming indirectly enhanced macrophyte detritus dry mass loss and C release mainly by the amount of energy input rather than by the way in which warming was provided (i.e., by a fixed increment or in heat waves). However, we found significantly different amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) released between the two warming treatments, and there was an asymmetric response of N and P release patterns to the two warming treatments, possibly due to species-specific responses of decomposers to short-term temperature fluctuations and litter quality. Our results conclude that future climate scenarios can significantly accelerate organic matter decomposition and C, N, and P release from decaying macrophytes, and more importantly, there are asymmetric alterations in macrophyte-derived detrital N and P release dynamic. Therefore, future climate change scenarios could lead to alterations in N/P ratios in the water column via macrophyte decomposition processes and ultimately affect the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems, especially in the plankton community.",,,,,"yang, yujing/GXF-6999-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,APR 20,2021,55,8,,,,,5272,5281,,10.1021/acs.est.1c00884,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c00884,,MAR 2021,,,,,,33764736,,,,,WOS:000643546400105,View Full Record in Web of Science

Patterns of cold hardiness declined dramatically during the deacclimation and rose during the reacclimation in both cultivars. Our results indicated that Daewol' possessed higher capacity in response to repeated deacclimation and reacclimation treatments than Kiraranokiwami'. Daewol' showed more sensitive changes in the carbohydrates in response to warm and low temperatures compared with Kiraranokiwami'. Daewol' indicated almost similar repeated down- and up-patterns in soluble sugar content in response to repeated deacclimation and reacclimation, whereas it indicated repeated up- and down-patterns in starch content. However, Kiraranokiwami' showed a progressive increase in the soluble sugar content and a progressive decrease in starch content. Notably, patterns of accumulation of a 60-kDa dehydrin protein encoded by the PpDhn1 gene were confirmed through western blotting and paralleled fluctuations of cold hardiness in both cultivars. Expression of this dehydrin was weak in both cultivars during deacclimation but its band intensity increased during reacclimation. Changes in related genes (-amylase, PpDhn1, PpDhn2 and PpDhn3) were positively correlated with changes in cold hardiness throughout the experiment.

The warming effects on the abundance and size structure of a Mediterranean coastal lagoon plankton community were investigated in this study. Water from Cabras Lagoon (Italy) was incubated in laboratory for 16 days in winter, excluding mesozooplankton. Three temperature treatments were applied: (i) the in situ winter mean water temperature; (ii) + 3 degrees C, as forecasted for the Mediterranean region by the next century; (iii) + 6 degrees C, as forecasted for the Mediterranean region by the next two centuries. A direct and positive effect of warming on ciliate density was observed in absence of their predators, as well as a taxonomic composition shift from Oligotrichs to Scuticociliatida. In turn, a decrease in heterotrophic nanoflagellate density was detected under warming. Phytoplankton (autotrophic cell size > 2 mu m) density increased significantly, while their mean cell size decreased strongly throughout the experiment at the highest temperature. A significant change in phytoplankton class composition, consisting of the increase of smaller Chlorophyceae which replaced larger Bacillariophyceae, was observed under heating. Considering picoplankton (cell size < 2 mu m), a decrease in larger autotrophic cell density was contemporary to an increase in smaller heterotrophic cell density, especially at the highest temperature.

To evaluate the effects of LPS on follicular dynamics in a subacute inflammatory disease state, 14 Angus heifers (BW = 413 kg +/- 14) were blocked by weight and assigned to vehicle (n = 7) or LPS treated (n = 7) groups. Heifers received subcutaneous injections of saline (CON) or 2.0 mu g/kg LPS on d 2, 5, and 8 of a select synch plus controlled internal drug release device (CIDR) follicular wave synchronization protocol. Fifty hours following CIDR withdrawal, ovaries were harvested, and follicular fluid was collected for hormone and LPS analysis. Daily blood samples were collected from d 0 to d 7. Beginning on d 8 blood samples were collected at 0, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 50 h following LPS challenge. Rectal temperatures were recorded prior to treatment and at regular intervals after each LPS challenge. Heifers treated with LPS exhibited mild (+ 0.5 degrees C) hyperthermia (P < 0.05) at 3, 4, and 8 h after the initial LPS challenge (d 2) when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Follicular fluid concentrations of estradiol (E-2) increased (P = 0.04) in LPS-treated heifers compared to controls (1,595 ng/mL and 808 ng/mL +/- 240, respectively), while follicular fluid progesterone (P 4 ) concentrations did not differ ( P = 0.27) between treatment groups. Additionally, LPS concentrations tended to be increased (P = 0.59) in dominant follicles of LPS-treated heifers, but no difference was detected (P = 0.81) in small developing follicles. To further delineate the impact of LPS on ovarian signaling pathways, a granulosa cell line (KGN) was incubated in the presence or absence of LPS (10 mu g/mL) for 48 h. Cells were then collected for gene expression and protein analysis. Cells in both treatment groups expressed toll-like receptor 4, myeloid differentiation factor-2 receptor, and CD-14 complex genes required for LPS signaling. Cells treated with LPS exhibited decreased mRNA expression of aromatase (P = 0.03) and beta-catenin (P = 0.02). However, no change (P > 0.10) was detected in abundance of total beta-catenin protein or beta-catenin phosphorylated isoforms at serine 552 or 675. Based on results from this in vivo experiment, these investigators concluded that low doses of LPS can alter E-2 concentrations and this effect may be modulated in part through beta-catenin regulation of aromatase transcription.

Several regional collaborative integrated ecosystem research projects (IERPs) were conducted to gain understanding of fish population fluctuations in relation to the surrounding environment. The Gulf of Alaska (GOA) IERP is one example of such an effort. Products of this program include a suite of in situ observations from fully integrated ecosystem surveys, laboratory experiments of physical thresholds for fish condition, and high-resolution oceanographic, planktonic, and habitat distribution models. When coupled, the synthesis products of this program can be utilized to understand system connectivity and highlight the primary ecosystem drivers of the GOA. Much of this information was included in annual GOA ecosystem status reports through individual indicator contributions. However, assimilation of these data into single-species stock assessments has remained limited. We provide a clear and direct avenue for including the products of these IERPs through the new ecosystem and socioeconomic profile (ESP) framework that identifies mechanistic relationships and tests ecosystem linkages within the stock assessment process. We present a case study using a data synthesis of the five commercially and ecologically valuable focal species of the GOAIERP (sablefish, pollock, Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and Pacific ocean perch). Information was organized along the categories of distribution, phenology, and condition by life history stage to develop life history narratives for each species. These narratives identified critical ecosystem processes that could impact survival of each species. We then used habitat distribution models, seasonal phenology, and energy allocation strategies to sequentially reduce two gridded temperature datasets to reflect the life experience of the stock. This method essentially aligns ecosystem information at a spatial and temporal scale relevant to a stock and creates informed indicators that could then be related to a stock assessment parameter of interest, such as recruitment. Informed temperature indicators differed in magnitude and variability when compared to non-informed indicators and demonstrating species and stage-specific thermal preferences. The difference between the informed indicators and the non informed indicators can also highlight thresholds and trends in habitat preference that could be further investigated with targeted process studies or laboratory experiments. The coordinated nature of the IERP allowed for the creation of these informed indicators that would not be possible with the results of any one process study. Both the stock-specific narratives and the informed indicators can be included into the ESPs for further monitoring and development. This integration ensures that the identified ecosystem linkages are evaluated concurrently with the stock assessment and ultimately transferred to fishery managers in an efficient and effective format for informing management decisions.",,,,,,"Pirtle, Jodi/0000-0002-4421-8234; Barbeaux, Steven/0000-0001-9498-0369; Watson, Jordan/0000-0002-1686-0377; Deary, Alison Laurel/0000-0001-5134-6595",,,,,,,,,,,,,0967-0645,1879-0100,,,,APR,2022,198,,,,,,,,105070,10.1016/j.dsr2.2022.105070,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr2.2022.105070,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000792678100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we studied how the growth rate influenced the skeletal oxygen and carbon isotope ratios (delta O-18 and delta C-13) and the Sr/Ca ratio in a common-garden experiment involving the long-term culture of Porites australiensis clone colonies. Comparison of the seasonal minimum delta O-18 values during summer showed a negligible influence of the large intercolony variation in growth rate (2-10 mm yr(-1)) on delta O-18 variation, but delta O-18 was relatively sensitive to temporary intracolony growth-rate changes related to colony health. In contrast, the Sr/Ca ratio was robust against both inter- and intracolony growth-rate variation. We found a positive shift in delta C-13 in slower growing corals, which we attributed to the kinetic behaviour of the calcification reaction. The seasonal fluctuation in delta C-13 corresponded not to changes in light intensity nor to delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater, but to photosynthetic efficiency as measured by pulse-amplitude photometry. These findings support the inference that coral skeletal Sr/Ca and delta O-18 in a long-lived colony can function as a palaeoclimate archive by recording signals of clonal growth. We also propose practical guidelines for the proper interpretation of coral records. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The transpiration from Cyclobalanopsis glauca (syn. Quercus glauca) stand on a rocky hilly slope in South China was measured during the dry period of 2006 by using the Granier's sap-flow method. During the experimental period, maximum sap flux density (J (s)) ranged from 20 to 40 g H2O m(-2) s(-1) according to diameter of breast height (DBH) of individual trees. On sunny days, daily transpiration varied between 3.4 and 1.8 mm day(-1). Transpiration of C. glauca was closely correlated to the radiation, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Soil moisture was a very important factor influencing transpiration. The very low soil water content might result in low stand transpiration even when VPD is high, but high soil water content might also result in low transpiration if it was low VPD. However, VPD rather than soil moisture, affected largely the stand transpiration under high soil water content. The amount of transpiration was much more than that of the total soil moisture loss during the continuous sunny days, indicating that the dry shallow soils were probably not the only source for root-uptake water. C. glauca grows deep roots through the rock fissures of epikarst, indicating that epikarst might be another main source for sustaining transpiration in response to dry demand in autumn. Therefore, a large amount of deep roots of karst species would be a very important hydraulic connecting from the epikarst to above ground by transpiration, which would promote the biogeochemical process in a karst system.",,,,,"zhang, zhongfeng/V-7237-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0912-3814,1440-1703,,,,JUL,2009,24,4,,,,,791,801,,10.1007/s11284-008-0553-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-008-0553-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000267680600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our objective was to create a model of herbage digestibility for a range of N fertilizer levels and defoliation practices on the basis of changes in vegetative grass tiller structure rather than on dates of cutting or grazing. An experiment was conducted for two spring and two summer regrowths to examine the digestibility of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) whole laminae (Lw) and youngest fully expanded laminae (Ly) for two N rates, and two defoliation patterns differing in the initial cutting date. Data were collected for lamina digestibility, dates at which a new leaf and its ligule were visible, and lamina and sheath lengths at least three times during each regrowth. There was a significant effect of N and cutting date on Ly and Lw digestibility, both variables being correlated significantly. At the ligule stage, Ly digestibility decreased between two successive leaves on a tiller, but this decrease was least when the N rate was low. For each regrowth, a single significant relationship was found between Ly digestibility and the growth duration of the lamina outside the sheath. As lamina growth duration depends both on sheath length and herbage N status, Ly digestibility was expressed according to these two easily measurable sward states. The model used to predict the green lamina digestibility at the whole canopy level could also explain the faster decline of herbage digestibility when the N rate was higher or when daily temperatures increased. In both cases, sheath length increased faster from one insertion level to the next, leading to a longer lamina growth duration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0011-183X,1435-0653,,,,JAN-FEB,2002,42,1,,,,,214,223,,10.2135/cropsci2002.0214,http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2002.0214,,,,,,,,11756277,,,,,WOS:000173296000031,View Full Record in Web of Science

Additionally, much effort has gone into understanding the C cycle and generating models suitable for C flux prediction. We used published data from long-term tillage experiments performed in the Pampas of Argentina, where CO2-C emissions from organic C pools were determined in the field, for developing empirical models suitable for C flux emission prediction. We also performed 113 field experiments with corn (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] to determine crop C inputs to the soil. Two empirical modeling techniques were tested: polynomial regression and artificial neural networks. Both methodologies generated good models with R-2 ranging from 0.70 to 0.86. Nevertheless, neural networks performed better than regressions, with significantly lower RMSE values for both CO2-C emissions and C input prediction. Daily CO2-C emissions could be predicted by the neural network (R-2 = 0.86) using soil C content, temperature, and moisture level as independent variables. Crop C inputs (R-2 = 0.85) were estimated using crop type, yield, and rainfall during the growing cycle. The models were used for evaluating of the impact of soybean introduction in rotations during the 1970 to 1980 decade. Despite soybean C inputs to the soil being lower than those of wheat and corn, which were replaced in rotations, soil C budgets are similar compared with the 1970 to 1980 period, or changed from negative to positive at the present. These changes were associated with yield increases ascribed to technological improvement that resulted in greater C inputs from graminaceous crops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0361-5995,1435-0661,,,,MAY-JUN,2011,75,3,,,,,965,975,,10.2136/sssaj2009.0427,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2009.0427,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290856500022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Grey mould results mainly from latent infection of flower parts, which develop into rots once fruit begins to ripen. Current control of grey mould relies on scheduled application of fungicides during flowering and early fruiting period for open-field crops. Although risk of grey mould on crops under protection is greatly reduced, routine fungicide application is often used to control grey mould. We developed a disease forecasting system for strawberry grey mould. The forecasting model uses day vapour pressure deficit and night temperature to predict the daily incidence of flower infection by B. cinerea and subsequent fruit infection. A series of experiments were conducted on both open-field and protected crops of cultivar 'Elsanta' to evaluate the usefulness of this system for practical disease management. Overall, the incidence of grey mould at harvest was very low, even on open-field untreated plants. However, there were significant differences in the level of post-harvest Botrytis among treatments. All model-based treatments reduced the incidence of grey mould in post-harvest tests, compared to the untreated. Overall, the model-based strategies achieved comparable success in controlling grey mould to the conventional strategy but with reduced fungicide input. The exact reduction in fungicide use varied greatly among years, ranging from 10 to 60%. Overall, it appears that the risk of grey mould on early-covered crops of 'Elsanta' is minimal and fungicide application against grey mould during flowering and fruiting appears thus to be not necessary.",,,,,"Xu, Xiangming/I-3050-2014","Xu, Xiangming/0000-0002-4567-7117",,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,978-94-62610-37-8,,,,2014,1049,,,,,,613,619,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1049.95,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1049.95,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000357650200094,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the central Heihe River Basin of arid north-western China, Linze jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. var. inermis (Bunge) Relid.) plantations cover more than 10,000 ha, too. Water use by this species is expected to change or modify catchment hydrological process. To Our knowledge, there is no information on the transpiration and canopy conductance of the jujube plantations in arid north-western China. Therefore, Transpiration and canopy conductance were monitored in a 14-year-old Linze jujube orchard. The experiment was carried out in the central Heihe River Basin, near Pingchuan Town (Linze County, Gansu Province, China) during growing season of 2006, from May to the first ten days of October. Eight trees were used to measure sap flow using the heat-pulse-velocity method. The orchard was irrigated adequately during the study. Transpiration was estimated from the sap flow measurements. During the experiment, the transpiration rate of the orchard ranged from 0-32 to 1.40 mm per day. Canopy Conductance was obtained from estimated daily transpiration and climatic variables measured on a half-hour basis, and canopy conductance for water vapour transfer was between 1.20 to 82.57 mm s(-1), with a mean of 11.86 +/- 6.84 mm s(-1) during the observation period. Air temperature and vapour-pressure deficit exhibited it linear relationship with sap flow velocity and the relationship between these factors and canopy conductance Could be represented by an exponential decay function.

In both seasons Guernseys spent more time feeding (p<0.05) in comparison with the Jerseys. It was also observed that lying occurred more often in Jerseys than the Guernseys (p<0.05) in both seasons. During the wet season, Jerseys ruminated longer (p<0.05) than the Guernseys. The health status of the animals was determined by examining the respiratory frequency, heart rate, rectal temperature, haemoglobin erythrocytes and leucocytes of the experimental animals.

Spawning rates oscillated according the frequencies of food fluctuations. For high frequencies of food variability (12 h), the light conditions at which food was available had a quantitative effect, with higher production rates for copepods feeding at high food concentration by night. Alternating 24 h high food-low food concentrations had no effects on the average fecundity. However, lower frequency food fluctuations (>48 h high food-low food) reduced egg production. Temperature seemed to control maximum egg production rates, and the length of the starvation period determined the time required to reach normal (control) egg productions after restarting feeding.

Amethyst Sunbirds (Chalcomitra amethystina) are relatively large African sunbirds (15 g). They are considered non-migratory and thus have to cope with the temperature changes and physiological stresses a new season brings. This study compared altitudinal subpopulations and the seasonal shifts in metabolic parameters between and within the subpopulations in metabolic parameters. Amethyst Sunbirds were caught in summer and winter at three different altitudinal subpopulations; Underberg (1555 m asl), Howick (1075 m asl) and Oribi Gorge (541 m asl). Upon capture, metabolic rates of the sunbirds were measured indirectly by quantifying oxygen consumption ((V)over dot(O2)) using flow through respirometry at 5 and 25 degrees C. Birds then underwent a 6-week acclimation period at 25 degrees C on a 12 L: 12D cycle. (V)over dot(O2) was measured post-acclimation at 8 different temperatures (15, 5, 10, 20, 30, 28, 25 and 33 degrees C), which were ordered randomly in the experimental protocol to avoid acclimation bias. Experiments were repeated for a winter and summer season. In general, Amethyst Sunbird subpopulations from Underberg and Howick showed higher post-acclimation resting metabolic rates per temperature in winter than in summer trials. Underberg and Howick subpopulations respectively showed a significant difference between summer and winter (V)over dot(O2) at 5 and 10 degrees C. Thermal neutral zones of all of the subpopulations of sunbirds shifted between winter and summer. Post-acclimation basal metabolic rate of sunbirds decreased significantly by 38.8% from winter to summer for the Underberg subpopulation, increased by 44.8% for the Howick subpopulation and did not change significantly for the Oribi Gorge subpopulation (5.8% decrease).

These datasets include the Canadian Precipitation Analysis and the thin-plate smoothing splines (ANUSPLIN), North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), University of Washington (UW) and Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) gridded products. Uncertainties are evaluated at different stages of the VIC implementation, starting with the driving datasets, optimization of model parameters, and model calibration during cool and warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The inter-comparison of the forcing datasets (precipitation and air temperature) and their VIC simulations (snow water equivalent - SWE - and runoff) reveals widespread differences over the FRB, especially in mountainous regions. The ANUSPLIN precipitation shows a considerable dry bias in the Rocky Mountains, whereas the NARR winter air temperature is 2 degrees C warmer than the other datasets over most of the FRB. In the VIC simulations, the elevation-dependent changes in the maximum SWE (maxSWE) are more prominent at higher elevations of the Rocky Mountains, where the PCIC-VIC simulation accumulates too much SWE and ANUSPLIN-VIC yields an underestimation. Additionally, at each elevation range, the day of maxSWE varies from 10 to 20 days between the VIC simulations. The snow melting season begins early in the NARR-VIC simulation, whereas the PCIC-VIC simulation delays the melting, indicating seasonal uncertainty in SWE simulations. When compared with the observed runoff for the Fraser River main stem at Hope, BC, the ANUSPLIN-VIC simulation shows considerable under-estimation of runoff throughout the water year owing to reduced precipitation in the ANUSPLIN forcing dataset. The NARR-VIC simulation yields more winter and spring runoff and earlier decline of flows in summer due to a nearly 15-day earlier onset of the FRB springtime snowmelt. Analysis of the parametric uncertainty in the VIC calibration process shows that the choice of the initial parameter range plays a crucial role in defining the model hydrological response for the FRB. Furthermore, the VIC calibration process is biased toward cool and warm phases of the PDO and the choice of proper calibration and validation time periods is important for the experimental setup. Overall the VIC hydrological response is prominently influenced by the uncertainties involved in the forcing datasets rather than those in its parameter optimization and experimental setups.",,,,,"Islam, Siraj Ul/Z-1665-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1027-5606,1607-7938,,,,MAR 29,2017,21,3,,,,,1827,1847,,10.5194/hess-21-1827-2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1827-2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000402920400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the number of studies for this ecosystem type increased more than tenfold during the last decade, studies covering an entire year and spanning more than 1-2 years remained scarce. This study reports the results of continuous measurements of soil-atmosphere C-and N-gas exchange with high temporal resolution carried out since 1994 at the Hoglwald Forest spruce site, an experimental field station in Southern Germany. Annual soil N2O, NO and CO2 emissions and CH4 uptake (1994-2010) varied in a range of 0.2-3.0 kgN(2)O-N ha(-1) yr(-1), 6.4-11.4 kg NO-N ha(-1) yr(-1), 7.0-9.2 t CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1), and 0.9-3.5 kgCH(4)-C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The observed high fluxes of N-trace gases are most likely a consequence of high rates of atmospheric nitrogen deposition (>20 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) of NH3 and NOx to our site. For N2O, cumulative annual emissions were >= 0.8 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) in years with freeze-thaw events (5 out 14 of years). This shows that long-term, multi-year measurements are needed to obtain reliable estimates of N2O fluxes for a given ecosystem. Cumulative values of soil respiratory CO2 fluxes tended to be highest in years with prolonged freezing periods, i.e. years with below average annual mean soil temperatures and high N2O emissions (e.g. the years 1996 and 2006). Furthermore, based on our unique database on trace gas fluxes we analyzed if soil temperature, soil moisture measurements can be used to approximate trace gas fluxes at daily, weekly, monthly, or annual scale. Our analysis shows that simple-to-measure environmental drivers such as soil temperature or soil moisture are suitable to approximate fluxes of NO and CO2 at weekly and monthly resolution reasonably well (accounting for up to 59% of the variance). However, for CH4 we so far failed to find meaningful correlations, and also for N2O the predictive power is rather low. This is most likely due to the complexity of involved processes and counteracting effects of soil moisture and temperature, specifically with regard to N2O production and consumption by denitrification and microbial community dynamics.

The experiment involved the examination of whether aphid size was influenced by their vertical distribution and density on the host plant, as well as whether variations in hyperparasitoid size and symmetry were correlated with those of their aphid hosts. An aphid multivariate size index was obtained using principal component analysis, while symmetry was evaluated in terms of fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Samples were collected in 2007 on cabbage plants cultivated at an experimental farm located in UberlA cent ndia, Minas Gerais, Brazil (18A degrees 56'54aEuro(3)aEuro parts per thousand S; 48A degrees 12'46aEuro(3)aEuro parts per thousand W). The results demonstrated that the size of B. brassicae was negatively associated with temperature, but not with its vertical distribution on the host plant. Temperature was also negatively correlated with hyperparasitoid size. During warmer periods, females produced large quantities of small-sized offspring, whereas an opposite pattern, i.e. the production of fewer offspring of larger size took place during colder periods. This type of adjustment involving trade-offs between physiological and morphological mechanisms, as well as individual interaction with abiotic environmental factors, such as temperature, can be considered an adaptive plastic response in order to increase the chances of survival at a given locality. The encountered relationship between aphid and hyperparasitoid sizes may be an after effect of their indirectly biotic interaction. Hyperparasitoid FA was dependent on the width of the mummified aphids. However, the hypothesis that temperature and vertical distribution on the host plant might influence FA was not confirmed.",,,,,"Sampaio, Marcus Vinicius/I-3613-2013; Hymenoptera, Inct/I-2210-2013","Pedroso, Laurentina/0000-0002-5194-9422; Sampaio, Marcus Vinicius/0000-0002-8767-9030",,,,,,,,,,,,,1519-566X,1678-8052,,,,AUG,2012,41,4,,,,,272,277,,10.1007/s13744-012-0047-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-012-0047-7,,,,,,,,23950061,,,,,WOS:000305961300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we investigate both immediate changes in and the evolution of sexual dimorphism in response to a changing environment (with and without fluctuations) using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We investigate sex differences in plasticity and also the genetic architecture of body mass and developmental time dimorphism to test two existing hypotheses on sex differences in plasticity (adaptive canalization hypothesis and condition dependence hypothesis). We found a decreased sexual size dimorphism in higher temperature and that females responded more plastically than males, supporting the condition dependence hypothesis. However, selection in a fluctuating environment altered sex-specific patterns of genetic and environmental variation, indicating support for the adaptive canalization hypothesis. Genetic correlations between sexes (rMF) were affected by fluctuating selection, suggesting facilitated independent evolution of the sexes.

The age range of the calves was 150 to 450 days. Effects of day length (h) and of day length change (min/day) were assumed to be linear and effect of age was assumed to be quadratic. Three heat load indexes were calculated, accounting for day temperatures above 27 degrees C, or night temperatures above 18 degrees C, or both, and their effect was assumed to be linear also. Random effect of calf and fixed effect of the year were also accounted for by the regression analysis. The mean gain was 1.274 kg/day. The effect of day length tons 0.027 (s.e, 0.003) kg/day per h, and effect of day length change was 0.042 (s.e. 0.003) kg/day per min/day both effects being highly significant (P < 0.0001). The effects of heat load according to each of the three indexes were either not significant, or tended to be positive, which implies increased gain with increasing heat load. Effect of age was positive (P = 0.0005), and of age(2) was negative (P < 0.0001). Based on the regression model that did not include heat load effect, the peak gain was obtained on 19 May, 33 days before the longest day and the trough was obtained on 18 November, with a difference of 0.206 kg/day (proportionately 0.15 of the peak gain) between peak and trough gains.

Although these formulations generally provide a satisfactory description of the present-day Greenland geometry, they have not all been tested for paleo ice sheets. Using the climate-ice sheet model CLIMBER-GRISLI coupled with different PDD models, we evaluate how the parameterisation of the ablation may affect the evolution of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets in the transient simulations of the last glacial cycle. Results from fully coupled simulations are compared to time-slice experiments carried out at different key periods of the last glacial period. We find large differences in the simulated ice sheets according to the chosen PDD model. These differences occur as soon as the onset of glaciation, therefore affecting the subsequent evolution of the ice system. To further investigate how the PDD method controls this evolution, special attention is given to the role of each PDD parameter. We show that glacial inception is critically dependent on the representation of the impact of the temperature variability from the daily to the inter-annual time scale, whose effect is modulated by the refreezing scheme. Finally, an additional set of sensitivity experiments has been carried out to assess the relative importance of melt processes with respect to initial ice sheet configuration in the construction and the evolution of past Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Our analysis reveals that the impacts of the initial ice sheet condition may range from quite negligible to explaining about half of the LGM ice volume depending on the representation of stochastic temperature variations which remain the main driver of the evolution of the ice system. The main findings of this paper underline the need for conducting studies with high resolution climate models coupled to detailed snow models to better constrain the temporal and spatial variations of the PDD parameters. The development of such approaches could improve the calibration of the PDD formulation which is still widely used in climate-ice sheet studies.",,,,,"Charbit, Sylvie/X-5466-2019; KAGEYAMA, Masa/F-2389-2010; Roche, Didier M./C-9875-2010","KAGEYAMA, Masa/0000-0003-0822-5880; Roche, Didier M./0000-0001-6272-9428; Ritz, Catherine/0000-0003-0785-8571",,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-0416,1994-0424,,,,,2013,7,2,,,,,681,698,,10.5194/tc-7-681-2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-7-681-2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000321181800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

To isolate long-term effects of [CO2] on water use efficiency at ecosystem level, we used the FORECAST Climate forest model, calibrated for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in the southwestern Pyrenees, growing at a Mediterranean montane site and at a continental subalpine site. Future climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were generated using a battery of six climate models to estimate daily values of temperature and precipitation in a 90-year series. A factorial experiment was designed to disentangle the importance on C pools of three growing limiting factors (nitrogen limitation, climate (temperature + precipitation) limitation and atmospheric CO2 concentration). The relative importance of each factor was quantified by comparing the scenario with the limitation of each individual factor turned on with the non-limitation scenario. Positive CO2 fertilization due to improvement in water use efficiency was detected by the model, but its quantitative impact improving tree growth was minimum: its average increase in ecosystem C pools ranged from 0.3 to 0.9%. At the site with cooler climate conditions (continental), the main limitation for tree growth was climate. Such limitation will be reduced under climate change and the ecosystem will store more carbon. At the site with milder climate conditions (Mediterranean), N availability was the main limiting factor albeit modulated by water availability. Such limitation could be reduced under climate change as N cycling could accelerate (higher litterfall production and decomposition rates) but also increase if droughts become more frequent and severe. In addition, the magnitude of the uncertainty related to climate model selection was much more important than CO2 fertilization, indicating that atmospheric processes are more important than tree physiological processes when defining how much carbon could be gained (or lost) in forests under climate change. In conclusion, due to the small changes in forest C pools caused by variation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations compared to changes caused by other growth limiting factors (nutrients, climate), reducing uncertainty related to climate projections seems a more efficient way to reduce uncertainty in tree growth projections than increasing forest model complexity.",,,,,"González de Andrés, Ester/AAH-3710-2019; Blanco, Juan A./A-4554-2009","Blanco, Juan A./0000-0002-6524-4335; Gonzalez de Andres, Ester/0000-0001-7951-5426",,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,,,SEP 1,2019,407,,,,,,,,108737,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108737,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.108737,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000482521300011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accordingly, the observation of the variation of the system states via analysis of the obtained response with temperature data is necessary to compensate the fluctuation of physical temperature for accurate calibration of the radiometer. However, the accuracy of the previous method (which uses one or more temperature probe) can rarely obtain an accurate estimated result; its accuracy is insufficient for high-precision measurement applications. Additionally, previous methods may cause unpredictable estimation errors when using regression methods with fewer measurable sensors. Therefore, more advanced compensation methods, which can compensate for the drift in radiometer output using temperature sensors (based on the analysis of the distinctive features of the temperature), are required to estimate the brightness temperature. In this paper, an optimized thermal compensation method using a selection of the optimal point for gain and offset probing to control the coefficients is analyzed using both the correlation-matrix- based hierarchical clustering and a comparison with the response stability for the training period. Then, the clustered temperature sensors of the radiometer system are used in the predictor variable to achieve optimum compensation of radiometer response variation. Next, the regression model of the multiple linear clustering method is compared the estimation accuracy for the selected training period and temperature sensors. Improved results relative to the reference method are achieved using the proposed model in experiments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1530-437X,1558-1748,,,,MAR 1,2017,17,5,,,,,1269,1276,,10.1109/JSEN.2016.2636905,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2016.2636905,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000395672500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies suggested that higher heat dose in early life stage of insect generally decreased immediate survival and depressed adult reproduction through carry-over effects, or unchanged adult performance through recovery effects. However, our previous study showed a different pattern, in which longer heat exposures in larval stage did not always decrease but sometimes increase the subsequent adult maturation success in the diamondback moth. We speculated that it might be another important pattern in the carry-over effects vs. heat dose, and conducted experiments using a global pest, Plutella xylostella. Our present results suggested that heat exposures in early life stage reduced the immediate survival and produced general declines with significant zigzag fluctuating patterns in subsequent body size and reproduction as exposure durations increased. The similar patterns were also validated in other insect taxa and other stresses by reanalyzing the experiment data from literatures.

When the process-based model and crop model were linked, the dry and fresh matter of the pineapple flesh, as affected by climatic conditions, could be used as inputs to predict the TSS (%) at harvest. The relative rate of transformation of carbon as sugars in the fruit flesh for the synthesis of compounds other than sugars was estimated during fruit growth. TSS (%) were compared for harvested fruit grown under eight agro-climatic conditions. In the flesh of fruit harvested close to maturity, i.e., at 1400 degree-days after flowering, TSS (%) were significantly related (r(2) = 0.55, P<0.001) to total soluble sugar content. The variability of TSS (%) between the eight agro-climatic groups ranged from 16.9 for pineapples grown in dry locations irrigated, under N-deficit conditions to 19.4 for pineapples grown in dry locations, without irrigation and without N deficiency. The variability of TSS (%) was substantial within each of the eight agro-climatic groups: standard deviations ranged from 0.9 to 1.5 for pineapples grown in dry locations, irrigated, without N deficiency and in dry locations, without irrigation and without N deficiency, respectively. For data from 14 experiments conducted under different climatic conditions, N fertilization, and irrigation conditions, the model predicted the TSS (%) at harvest with an RRMSE of 0.04. By linking this sugar model to the SIMPINA crop model, the impact of environmental conditions and cultural practices on the growth and development of pineapple are taken into account to predict the gustatory quality of pineapple grown on Reunion Island. The model could have a practical application to manage fruit quality, plan harvest, and marketing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the first experiment, naive white-tailed deer were infected intradermally and subcutaneously with EHDV-2 and monitored via physical examinations, complete blood counts, or and beta interferon (IFN) assays, viral isolation, and serology, Infected deer had a wide range of clinical signs in response to infection. Eleven of the 16 deer had body temperature elevations greater than or equal to 0.5 C between post-infection day (PID) 4 and 8. Infected deer had decreased lymphocyte counts between PID 6 and 10 that returned to normal levels by PID 17. Severely lymphopenic animals had the most severe clinical signs; five of 10 deer with lymphocyte counts less than 1000 cells/mu l succumbed to the infection. Viremia was detected in all 16 EHDV-2 infected animals by PID 4, and peak viremias occurred between PID 4 and PID 10. Three deer remained viremic until PID 56, the study endpoint.

The mixtures were ensiled for 60 days at room temperature in polythene bags. Ensiling (time effect) resulted in an increase (P< 0.001) in titrable acidity level and a decrease in pH in the silage. In titrable acidity, there was an interaction effect (P< 0.001) between the levels of citrus pulp and the ensiling time, such that there was an increase (P< 0.001) in titrable acidity and a decrease (P< 0.001) in pH in the 4 treatments both before and after fermentation. However, compared with the premix, there was a large increase in titrable acidity in silage following fermentation. Ensiling resulted in complete elimination of all coliforms in spite of their presence in large numbers in the mixtures before ensiling. Although the total nitrogen content was not affected, ensiling resulted in an increase (P< 0.05) in the proportion of soluble nitrogen. The potential degradability of the silage dry matter ranged from 487 to 582 g/kg and increased (P< 0.05) with the level of citrus pulp. In experiment 2, the daily intake of dry matter, organic matter, digestible organic matter and the digestibility of organic matter increased significantly with levels of citrus pulp in the basal silage diet, but there was no difference (P> 0.05) in dry matter intake between diets containing 0, 76 and 167 g/kg citrus pulp when the intake was expressed on the basis of metabolic body weight. However, there was a decrease (P< 0.001) in intake of silage and diet dry matter, organic matter and digestible organic matter when the level of citrus pulp in the basal silage diet increased from 167 to 272 g/kg. Only animals on the basal silage diet containing 167 g/kg citrus pulp had a higher (P< 0.05) and positive nitrogen balance of 1.0 g/day. It is concluded that wheat straw and poultry litter can be ensiled successfully with citrus pulp to produce silage that is safe and of high fermentation quality.

Yet, typical protocols in comparative physiology that examine environmental change typically employ simple step-wise changes in the experimental stressor of interest (e.g., temperature, water availability, oxygen, nutrition). Such protocols fall short of mimicking actual natural environments and may be inadequate for fully exploring the physiological effects of stochastic, extreme weather events. Indeed, numerous studies from the field of thermal biology, especially, indicate nonlinear and sometimes counterintuitive findings associated with variable and fluctuating (but rarely truly stochastic) protocols for temperature change. This Perspective article suggests that alternative experimental protocols should be employed that go beyond step-wise protocols and even beyond variable protocols employing circadian rhythms, for example, to those that actually embrace nonpredictable elements. Such protocols, though admittedly more difficult to implement, are more likely to reveal the capabilities (and, importantly, the limitations) of animals experiencing weather, as distinct from climate. While some possible protocols involving stochasticity are described as examples to stimulate additional thought on experimental design, the overall goal of this Perspective article is to encourage comparative physiologists to entertain incorporation of nonpredictable experimental conditions as they design future experimental protocols.",,,,,"Burggren, Warren W/A-1561-2016","Burggren, Warren W/0000-0001-8023-420X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0363-6119,1522-1490,,,,APR,2019,316,4,,,,,R318,R322,,10.1152/ajpregu.00307.2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00307.2018,,,,,,,,30698987,,,,,WOS:000465075100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adding extra protein-bound or free AA to the diet may correct the reduced AA intake of HS pigs. However, extra protein-bound AA may further increase the body heat load, whereas extra free AA does not affect the heat load of HS pigs. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1, the performance depression because of HS, compared with thermal neutrality, was determined with 30 pigs (31.1 +/- 1.2 kg BW) fed diets with AA only as protein or as a mix of protein and free AA. Heat stress pigs consumed 18 to 25% less Lys and Thr than thermal neutral. In Exp. 2, the effect of extra dietary protein-bound or free AA on performance and serum concentration of AA in 25 HS pigs (33.6 +/- 0.65 kg BW) was evaluated. Treatments were as follows: CON, wheat-soybean meal-free Lys-Thr-Met diet; xP diet, 26% more protein than the CON diet; xAA diet, 24% or more of each AA than the recommended level. Pigs were fed ad libitum. Blood samples were collected between 1600 and 1700 h, when pigs were exposed to the highest ambient temperature (around 41.3 degrees C). Body temperature ranged daily from 39.9 to 41.1 degrees C. The performance data were reported already. Pigs fed the xP diet consumed more of all indispensable AA and dispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05), and more Arg, Ile, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Ser (P < 0.05) than the xAA pigs. Except for Arg, xAA pigs consumed more indispensable AA than the CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Arg, His, Lys, Phe, Thr, Trp, and Val, was higher (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Except for Ile serum, indispensable AA were higher in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Ile, Leu, Thr, and Val were higher (P < 0.05), and Met tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in xAA than in xP pigs. The difference of Ile, Leu, Met, Thr, and Val between the CON and the xAA pigs was larger than that between the CON and the xP pigs (P < 0.05). Serum Asn and Tyr were higher, and Cys and Glu were lower (P < 0.05) in xP than in CON pigs. Serum Cys tended to be lower in xAA than in CON pigs (P < 0.10). Asp and Glu were higher (P < 0.05) in xAA pigs than in xP pigs. In conclusion, these serum AA results combined with the reported performance data indicate that extra free AA in diets for HS pigs may help to correct the reduced AA availability and performance of HS pigs, although higher levels of specific AA such as Ile and Met might be needed.",,,,,"A, Ne/ABE-4420-2020; Camacho-Morales, R.

To examine heart rate (f(H)) control at various stages of torpor in a marsupial hibernator, and to see whether fH variability differs from that of deep placental hibernators, we used radiotelemetry to measure ECG and body temperature (T-b) while measuring the rate of O-2 consumption and ventilation. f(H) and O-2 consumption rate during euthermia were at a minimum (321 +/- 34 beats min(-1), 0.705 +/- 0.048 ml O-2 g(-1) h(-1)) at an ambient temperature (T-a) of 31 degrees C. f(H) had an inverse linear relationship with T-a to a maximum of 630 +/- 19 beats min(-1) at a T-a of 20 degrees C. During entry into torpor at a Ta of 20 degrees C, f(H) slowed primarily as a result of episodic periods of cardiac activity where electrical activity of the heart occurred in groups of 3 or 4 heart beats. When T-b was stable at 24 degrees C in these torpor bouts, the episodic nature of f(H) had disappeared (i.e. no asystoles) with a rate of 34 +/- 3 beats min(-1). For multi-day bouts of deep torpor, T-a was lowered to 6.6 +/- 0.8 degrees C. During these deep bouts of torpor, T-b reached a minimum of 8.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C, with a minimum fH of 8 beats min(-1) and a minimum O-2 consumption rate of 0.029 +/- 0.07 ml O-2 g(-1) h(-1). Shivering bouts occurred in deep torpor about every 8 min, during which ventilation occurred, and f(H) was elevated to 40 beats min(-1). The duration of the QRS complex increased from 12 ms during euthermia to 69 ms at a Tb of 8 degrees C. These findings demonstrate the dynamic functioning range of f(H) to be about 600 beats min(-1) (similar to 80-fold), one of the largest known ranges in mammals.

At the same time it faced the fact that some of the goals in that aspect could not be met, mainly as a result of the prevailing poor indoor air quality (IAQ) conditions. Since the early 1980's IEQ has, therefore, become one of the major concerns in the area of building physics. Ventilation is an important tool for securing a good indoor climate and IAQ. In buildings without central ventilation and air conditioning systems, which are in most European countries the majority, natural ventilation is the only possible approach for achieving indoor thermal comfort and for complying with IAQ requirements. A series of experiments carried out by the authors confirmed the role of ventilation, due to its impact on the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. This study focuses on two parameters that determine the IEQ, the thermal comfort and the IAQ in a naturally ventilated office building in an urban area. Indoor and outdoor temperatures as well as relative humidity were monitored, as these are two of the main parameters that determine thermal comfort conditions. CO2 was monitored, as it is often used as an indicator for the effectiveness of ventilation, together with particulate matter bigger than or equal to 0.5 and to 5 microns aerodynamic diameter, which is considered as a major air pollutant. A questionnaire was handed out to the employees to track their behavioral patterns with respect to ventilation, to their activities and to smoking and also to estimate their apprehension of the indoor environmental conditions. The measurements confirmed the occupants' dissatisfaction with respect to IEQ. As far as thermal comfort is concerned the fluctuations' range of temperature and sometimes of relative humidity exceeded the limits that the thermal comfort standards foresee. A vital outcome is that either single side or cross natural ventilation seem to be ineffective to control relative humidity levels, which where low enough and sometimes lead to thermal discomfort during the heating period. As far as IAQ is concerned, the average CO2 concentrations were generally below the limits set by contemporary standards, though on some occasions high values were monitored. Natural ventilation plays an important role in reducing the CO2 concentration and, moreover, cross ventilation was proven to be more efficient than single sided ventilation. With respect to particle concentration the results indicated that natural ventilation can have a considerable impact on the particle levels in the building's interior. The results of this study are discussed in detail in this paper.",,,,,"Papadopoulos, Agis/AAO-3274-2021; Papadopoulos, Agis/AAG-5174-2020","Papadopoulos, Agis/0000-0002-4470-8903",,,,,,,,,,,,,1106-5516,,960-7475-24-0,,,,2003,,,,,,,44,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000239950800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Phytoplankton biomass (0.7-32.6 mu g chlorophyll l(-1)) and primary production (PP, 164-3570 mu g C l(-1) d(-1)) varied similarly to bacterial variables, with dissolved PP (DPP), i.e. released extracel-lularly, ranging from 3 to 36% of the total PP. The flux of DPP represented between 0.4 and 20% of bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC, 92-346 mu mol C l(-1)) daily turnover. In addition to temperature, moderate bottom-up control of bacterial assemblages was suggested by biomass-production regressions. Bacteria apparently depended more on phytoplankton-derived DOC than on its total concentration. The difference became larger when the total flux of carbon or bacterial carbon demand (BCD, 19-468 mu g C l(-1) d(-1)) was considered, with DPP explaining 53% of its variance compared with 37% from bulk DOC.

Polarotactic water detection is easiest at low solar elevations,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Using 180degrees field-of-view imaging polarimetry, we measured the reflection-polarization patterns of two artificial surfaces (water-dummies) in the red, green and blue spectral ranges under clear and partly cloudy skies at different solar elevations. The dummies consisted of a horizontal glass pane with a matt black or matt light grey cloth underneath, imitating a dark or bright water body, respectively. Assuming that polarotactic water insects interpret a surface as representing water if the degree of linear polarization of reflected light is higher than a threshold and the deviation of the direction of polarization from the horizontal is lower than a threshold, we calculated the proportion, P, of the artificial surfaces detected polarotactically as water. We found that at sunrise and sunset P is maximal for both water-dummies and their reflection-polarizational characteristics are most similar. From this, we conclude that polarotactic water detection is easiest at low solar elevations, because the risk that a polarotactic insect will be unable to recognize the surface of a dark or bright water body is minimal. This partly explains why many aquatic insect species usually fly en masse at dusk. The daily change in the reflection-polarization pattern of water surfaces is an important visual ecological factor that may contribute to the preference of the twilight period for habitat searching by polarotactic water insects. Air temperature at sunrise is generally low, so dusk is the optimal period for polarotactic aquatic insects to seek new habitats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,FEB,2004,207,5,,,,,755,765,,10.1242/jeb.00810,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.00810,,,,,,,,14747408,,,,,WOS:000189349800013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fire influences vegetation through multiple pathways, both above- and belowground. Few studies have yet attempted to tie these pathways together in a mechanistic way through soil heating even though the importance of soil heating for plants in fire-prone ecosystems is increasingly recognized. Here we combine an experimental approach with structural equation modelling (SEM) to simultaneously examine multiple pathways through which fire might influence herbaceous vegetation. In a high-diversity longleaf pine groundcover community in Louisiana, USA, we manipulated fine-fuel biomass and monitored the resulting fires with high-resolution thermocouples placed in vertical profile above- and belowground. We predicted that vegetation response to burning would be inversely related to fuel load owing to relationships among fuels, fire temperature, duration and soil heating. We found that fuel manipulations altered fire properties and vegetation responses, of which soil heating proved to be a highly accurate predictor. Fire duration acting through soil heating was important for vegetation response in our SEMs, whereas fire temperature was not. Our results indicate that in this herbaceous plant community, fire duration is a good predictor of soil heating and therefore of vegetation response to fire. Soil heating may be the key determinant of vegetation response to fire in ecosystems wherein plants persist by resprouting or reseeding from soil-stored propagules.Synthesis. Our SEMs demonstrate how the complex pathways through which fires influence plant community structure and dynamics can be examined simultaneously. Comparative studies of these pathways across different communities will provide important insights into the ecology, evolution and conservation of fire-prone ecosystems.",,,,,"Paine, C. E.

Stable isotopes of carbon are used to study plant stresses, which affect yields, but a growth chamber design that can be used to isolate the effects of environmental stresses on crop-sized species through precise maintenance of pCO(2) levels and the delta C-13 values of atmospheric CO2 (delta C-13(CO2)) is lacking. METHODS: We designed and built low-cost plant growth chambers for growing staple crop species under precise pCO(2) and delta C-13(CO2) conditions. Over the course of 14 hours, we assessed for pCO(2) stability at two targeted levels (ambient, similar to 400 ppm; and 2x, similar to 800 ppm) and measured the delta C-13(CO2) value within the two chambers using a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer. We also compared the temperature and relative humidity conditions within the two growth chambers, and in the ambient, outside air. RESULTS: Across our experimental period, we achieved delta C-13(CO2) stability (ambient: -8.05 +/- 0.17%; elevated: -12.99 +/- 0.29%) that showed nearly half the variability of any previously reported values for other chamber designs. The stability of the pCO(2) conditions (ambient: 406 +/- 3 ppm; elevated: 793 +/- 54 ppm) was comparable with that in previous studies, but our design provided similar to 8 times more growing space than previous chamber designs. We also measured nearly identical temperature and relative humidity conditions for the two chambers throughout the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: Our growth chamber design marks a significant improvement in our ability to test for plant stress across a range of future pCO(2) scenarios. Through significant improvement in delta C-13(CO2) stability and increased chamber size, small changes in carbon isotope fractionation can be used to assess stress in crop species under specific environmental (temperature, relative humidity, pCO(2)) conditions.

The atmospheric data comprises of an average daily air temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, total evapotranspiration, and precipitations. For the experiment independent variables i.e. atmospheric data and present groundwater level were used to model target variable i.e. predicted groundwater level for 24 and 48 hours in advance. The presented models give predictions 24 (first model) and 48 (second model) hours in advance for groundwater level fluctuations on Grohovo landslide. The first model is consisted from seven, and the second model from five rules. Both models have very high correlation coefficients of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively.

I examined changes in environmental conditions by examining time-series data sets that extend back at least into the 1980s, a period when frog populations were declining. The data include forest cover; annual mean, minimum, and maximum daily temperature; annual rainfall; rain and stream chemistry; and atmospheric-dust transport. I examined satellite imagery and air-chemistry samples from a single National Aeronautics and Space Administration aircraft flight across the Caribbean showing patches of pollutants, described as thin sheets or lenses, in the lower troposphere. The main source of these pollutants appeared to be fires from land clearing and deforestation, primarily in Africa. Some pollutant concentrations were high and, in the case of ozone, approached health limits set for urban air. Urban pollution impinging on Puerto Rico, dust generation from Africa (potential soil pathogens), and tropical forest burning (gaseous pollutants) have all increased during the last three decades, overlapping the timing of amphibian declines in eastern Puerto Rico. None of the data sets pointed directly to changes so extreme that they might be considered a direct lethal cause of amphibian declines in Puerto Rico.

Turbulence intensity and power spectrum of velocity fluctuation were calculated using the measured data. Thermal comfort and cooling efficiency were also compared. The results show that in the occupied zone, the airflow characteristics among MV, DV, and SV are different. The turbulent airflow fluctuation is enhanced in this classroom with multiple thermal manikins due to thermal buoyancy and airflow mixing effect. Thermal comfort evaluations indicate that in comparison with MV and DV, a higher supply air temperature should be adopted for SV to achieve general thermal comfort with low draft risk.

The physiological tolerance of invasive species as a potential mechanism driving invasion success is therefore a subject that merits further study. Specifically, we need to adequately evaluate the potential of species invasions under changing environmental conditions, so that adequate preventive measures can be taken to minimize any impacts on coastal ecosystems. Here, we experimentally evaluated the physiological responses of a recent invader in the Southern Atlantic, the shrimp Lysmata lipkei, under a warming ocean scenario. Adult shrimps were collected from rocky shores in southeastern Brazil and subjected to experimental trials under a control and a +3 degrees C scenario. Molecular biomarkers (in gills and muscle), upper thermal limits, acclimation response ratios, thermal safety margins, mortality rates, estimates of body condition and energy reserves were measured over 1month. Results suggest that higher temperatures elicit physiological adjustments at the molecular level, underpinning a high thermal tolerance. In addition, results indicated substantial acclimation capacity, with no evidence of decreased performance under an ocean-warming scenario. Thermal safety margins were low for shrimp from intertidal rock pools but high for shrimp from subtidal habitats. We conclude that the thermal tolerance of this shrimp species may favor its ongoing invasion along the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, mainly in subtidal habitats, both under present and future thermal conditions.

Constant normoxia, or 100% oxygen saturation, is therefore rare. Since the thermal sensitivity of invertebrates is directly linked to oxygen availability, we hypothesized that (i) the metabolic response of coastal marine invertebrates would be more sensitive to thermal stress when exposed to oxygen supersaturation rather than 100% oxygen saturation and (ii) natural diel fluctuation in oxygen availability rather than constant 100% oxygen saturation is a main driver of the thermal response. We tested the effects of oxygen regime on the metabolic rate, and haemocyanin and lactate levels, of velvet crabs (Necora puber) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), under rising temperatures (up to 24 degrees C) in the laboratory. Oxygen supersaturation and photosynthetically induced diel oxygen fluctuation amplified animal metabolic thermal response significantly in both species, demonstrating that the natural variability of oxygen in coastal environments can provide considerable physiological benefits under ocean warming. Our study highlights the significance of integrating ecologically relevant oxygen variability into experimental assessments of animal physiology and thermal response, and predictions of metabolic performance under climate warming.

The selected 24 Bovans Goldline hybrid laying hens were divided into three equal groups, two experimental groups (E1 and E2) and one control group (C). The laying hens were housed individually in cages with an automatic supply of drinking water, manual feeding, in a setting with controlled light and temperature regimens. Hens from individual groups were all fed a complete feed mix of the same composition and the only difference was in clinoptilolite supplementation: feed mixes for E1 and E2 groups contained 2% and 4% of clinoptilolite (commercial additive ZeoFeed) respectively, replacing the same amounts of wheat. The hens received feed mixes and drinking water ad libitum. During this 28-day experiment, feed consumption and the number and weight of eggs laid were monitored individually for each hen. At the end of the experiment, the balance test using the indicator method (Cr2O3) was performed in all eight hens in each of the groups. The results of balance tests were then used to calculate the metabolic utilization of selected nutrients (nitrogen, fat, ash, nitrogen-free extracts, starch, gross energy, Ca, P). After the balance tests, blood samples for haematological and biochemical examinations were collected via puncture of the vena basilica. The addition of 2% clinoptilolite to feed mix resulted in a highly significant (P <= 0.01) increase in mean egg weight to 64.69 g, but the addition of 4% clinoptilolite in group E2 resulted in a highly significant (P <= 0.01) decrease in mean egg weight to 62.20 g compared to the control (63.73 g). Moreover, daily feed mix consumption in group E1 decreased to 114 g per one laying hen/day compared to the controls (118 g per one laying hen/day). In group E2 (4% clinoptilolite), daily consumption of feed mix increased compared with the controls to 124 g. The 2% clinoptilolite supplementation of E1 group feed slightly increased metabolic utilization of fat, nitrogen-free extracts, starch and gross energy compared to group C. Results of haematological test of the hens' blood showed significant changes in haemoglobin, whose values in groups C and E1 were significantly higher (P <= 0.05) than in group E2.

J,"Leonard, AM; Lancaster, LT",,,,"Leonard, Aoife M.; Lancaster, Lesley T.",,,Maladaptive plasticity facilitates evolution of thermal tolerance during an experimental range shift,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background Many organisms are responding to climate change with dramatic range shifts, involving plastic and genetic changes to cope with novel climate regimes found at higher latitudes. Using experimental lineages of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, we simulated the initial phase of colonisation to progressively cooler and/or more variable conditions, to investigate how adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to shifts in thermal tolerance during colonisation of novel climates. Results We show that heat and cold tolerance rapidly evolve during the initial stages of adaptation to progressively cooler and more variable climates. The evolved shift in cold tolerance is, however, associated with maladaptive plasticity under the novel conditions, resulting in a pattern of countergradient variation between the ancestral and novel, fluctuating thermal environment. In contrast, lineages exposed to progressively cooler, but constant, temperatures over several generations expressed only beneficial plasticity in cold tolerances and no evolved response. Conclusions We propose that thermal adaptation during a range expansion to novel, more variable climates found at high latitudes and elevations may typically involve genetic compensation arising from maladaptive plasticity in the initial stages of adaptation, and that this form of (countergradient) thermal adaptation may represent an opportunity for more rapid and labile evolutionary change in thermal tolerances than via classic genetic assimilation models for thermal tolerance evolution (i.e., selection on existing reaction norms). Moreover, countergradient variation in thermal tolerances may typically mask cryptic genetic variability for these traits, resulting in apparent evolutionary stasis in thermal traits.",,,,,,"Leonard, Aoife/0000-0002-0785-6106",,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2148,,,,,APR 23,2020,20,1,,,,,,,47,10.1186/s12862-020-1589-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-020-1589-7,,,,,,,,32326878,,,,,WOS:000530108100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Maximum handling-size experiments indicated that redear sunfish as small as 14-cm total length were capable of consuming all sizes of Physa typically observed in ponds, whereas only redear sunfish of Lit least 32-cm total length are capable of consuming all commonly observed sizes of pond-dwelling Helisoma. When presented with a range of sizes of both snail species, redear sunfish consumed higher proportions of smaller- and medium-sized snails: the largest snails offered were uneaten or consumed in relatively small quantities.

Such predictions will enable pond owners to quickly evaluate whether stocking redear sunfish as a control agent for undesirable snail populations will be economically and logistically feasible.

In this study, larvae were produced through artificial breeding of mature migratory fish collected from wild. Three different age groups of hilsa larvae, such as three days post hatched (3 DPH, just before yolk sac exhaustion, swim mostly vertically, TL: 4.21 +/- 0.02 mm), 5 DPH (with oil globule, swim vertical and horizontal, TL: 5.26 +/- 0.12 mm) and 12 DPH (just before oil globule exhaustion, swims very fast, TL: 6.00 +/- 0.11 mm) were randomly distributed in nine well prepared rectangular earthen ponds (100 m(2)) in triplicate (n = 3) at the stocking density of 500 number m(-3).

Relevant physico-chemical parameters like pH, conductivity, temperature, water depth and dissolved oxygen were also monitored forth nightly. The experimental fish and fish carcass (before the experiment and at harvest) from each treatment were analysed in replicates for their proximate composition. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in daily weight gain, specific growth rate, final weight, relative growth rate, feed conversion ratio (FCR), survival, protein efficiency ratio for all the treatments. However there were significant differences (P < 0.05) in fish production (harvest), profit index, crude protein, crude fat, and ash composition of the fish carcass (at harvest). As stocking density increased, the crude protein content of the fish carcass decreased indicating an inverse relationship.

The Anthidiini tribe looks very promising in Brazil, in the light of ecosystem utility, but it is still a scientificaly poorly researched species. In order to fill this gap, studies on the bionomics of these species may collaborate on future efforts for the use of Epanthidium tigrinum as a pollinator. The presented research results aims to describe the bionomy and the biological cycle of the bee E. tigrinum (Schrottky, 1905) in pre-existing cavities. Conventional trap-nests inserted in wooden blocks were placed in covered spaces and daily observations of spontaneous nesting as well as individually tagged bees and nests incubated in B.O.D. were carried out during 11 months in Fortaleza-CE. The results showed that the competition with other species of bees for the pre-existing cavities and the lack of food resources or nest building materials are limiting factors for the establishment of E. tigrinum populations. However, once these problems were remediated, the bees showed multivoltine behavior, nesting throughout the experimental period. Data from 16 nests studied showed that bee foraging began on average at 7:50 a.m., foragers collected pollen in the morning and resin in the afternoon, took on average 15 days to complete a nest and there was a negative correlation with the temperature for the number of nests and for the number of cells constructed. The offspring emergency mean time was 43 days, the sexual ratio was 1.2: 1 (n = 66 emerged bees) and the mortality rate was 18.5%. The number of nests constructed per female ranged from 1 to 4 with an average size of 7.97 mm.

Despite multi-organizational efforts under the Bay of Bengal Program implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the Indian agar industry still heavily relies on the natural harvest of Gracilaria edulis from the southeastern coast of the Gulf of Mannar. Experimental cultivation of this species has been successful, but lack of a year-round supply of quality seed material has hampered the prospects of undertaking commercial farming. To maximize the efficiency of artificial seedling production, we used a Taguchi orthogonal array design to determine the optimal temperature, salinity, and pH for seedling production from primary, secondary, and tertiary fragments. The maximum growth was obtained at 25 A degrees C, 20 ppt salinity, and pH 7.5, where the highest daily growth rate (DGR) of 4.88 A +/- 1.04 % day(-1) (K (3) = 3.194) was recorded in tertiary fragments. The DGR of seedlings grown with shaking as well as static cultures ranged from 8.33 A +/- 1.50 to 10.26 A +/- 0.01 % day(-1) after 10 days. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that water motion did not significantly affect growth. The out-planting was successful for seedlings derived from laboratory culture.

In addition, underwater light levels were recorded, which allowed the construction of in situ production-irradiance (P-I) curves for these sediment communities. During all months the community was distinctly autotrophic, with 24 h production to respiration (P/R) ratios ranging from 2.9 to 4.4. We estimated an annual community net-production of 168 g C m(-2). hll parameters expressing the overall magnitude of production (community net and gross production; photosynthetic capacity, P-max) showed distinctly lower values in winter, indicating a strong seasonality. Between 63 and 75% of the variation of these parameters was explained by seasonal changes in temperature. Most other P-I curve parameters (light compensation point, I-c; light saturation point, I-k; photosynthetic efficiency, alpha) showed less obvious long term temporal patterns and were subject to large variation between single measuring days. A considerable proportion of the variation in I-c, I-k and cc (46 to 68%)could be attributed to daily differences in underwater light conditions,indicating rapid photoadaptation by the microalgal communities to variation in light conditions due to turbidity and/or cloud cover. In in situ enrichment experiments the excretion of holothurians enhanced community net production and P-max by about 1.2%. The enhancement most likely resulted from a rise of NH4+ concentration (0.1 mu mol l(-1) above the background level). The enhancement due to holothurian excretion products, in conjunction with the low quantum yield efficiency exhibited by the benthic community, indicate that production of benthic microalgae in our study area was limited by the availability of inorganic nitrogen.",,,,,"Uthicke, Sven/F-1810-2010","Uthicke, Sven/0000-0002-3476-6595",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,,,,,,1998,169,,,,,,1,11,,10.3354/meps169001,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps169001,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000075589000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, ETc was measured and a generalized Kc curve was calculated for paddy rice in the Sacramento Valley, California. Field experiments were conducted in three rice paddy fields during the 2011-2013 growing seasons. Surface renewal analysis, after calibration using eddy covariance method, was applied to obtain sensible heat flux values from high-frequency temperature readings; latent heat flux densities were characterized by the residual of the energy balance method. The results revealed that there is considerable variability in rice water use both spatially and temporally. The average 3-year measured seasonal ETc of the experimental fields ranged from 690 to 762mm in Butte County and from 681 to 813mm in the Colusa County. A mean daily seasonal ETc of 5.3mmd-1 and midseason ETc of 5.8mmd-1 was observed. The rice Kc values were lower than those commonly used to estimate rice ETc during the midseason and were greater than expected during early growth before canopy closure. For a typical growing season of 145days, the Kc values were estimated as 1.10, 1.00, and 0.80 for the initial-growth, midseason, and late-season stages, respectively. The generalized Kc curve is quite accurate for practical application and enables growers to determine rice crop water use in a reliable, usable, and affordable format. The proposed Kc information can be used to refine the estimates of rice consumptive water use in the Sacramento Valley for the purpose of water transfers to water-short areas of the State.

A mathematical site-specific model, DYNLOW, was constructed to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of these organic acids in coniferous forest soils using the modelling software STELLA(R). Experimentally derived values for biodegradation, adsorption, and daily values of soil temperature, moisture and hydrological flow were used to parameterize the model. The model describes the dynamics and downward movement of oxalate and citrate through the horizons (O, AE, E, Bhs, Bs) of three podzolic soil profiles in Sweden. After calibration. the model predicted average soil solution organic acid concentrations ranging from <1 to 90 muM, which was in agreement with experimental measurements (<1 to 116 muM). The model results indicated that microbial degradation of organic acids was in quantitative terms the biggest process regulating soil solution concentrations. Primary production rates of organic acid in the soil were predicted to be high (<1 to 1250 nmol g(-1) soil d(-1)) in comparison to the amount present at steady state in the soil solution pool (<0.1 to 240 nmol g(-1) soil). The downward transfer of organic acids between soil horizons due to mass flow was predicted to be a small flux (<0.1 to 3% of the total loss) compared to that lost by microbial biodegradation. The model predicted that the amount of basal soil respiration that could be attributable to the microbial turnover of organic acids was on average 19 +/- 22% of the basal CO2 production across all sites and horizons for citrate and 7 +/- 7% for oxalate.

Two sampling sites (573 m apart) were selected; the experimental site, and control site. Biomass and growth rates of all three extractive species were measured monthly, along with physicochemical parameters in the two sites, monitored for a period of up to one year for E. denticulatum and sevenmonth for P. viridis and Crassostrea sp. Results showed that both seaweed and P. viridis adopted in the fish farming site, where water temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen were found to be well within the optimal range of the three species. Growth of each species, however, aside from the seasonal changes in the weather pattern that influenced water movement, was mainly affected by the presence of epiphytes, predators and fouling organisms that were present during culture. These factors have reduced their potential biomass and growth rates. The introduction of the extractive species in the fish farm appeared to have checked the adverse effects of fish culture activities whose daily inputs of commercial feeds, could led to the suspended solids.

The paper is aimed at studying the thermocline response to slow (during a few days) and fast (up to two days) change of the current velocity, and also the process of changing in depth of the upper mixed layer lower boundary depending on the current velocity (at that the process is accompanied by the thickness and temperature gradient alteration in the thermocline). Methods and Results. The thermocline responses were analyzed using the data on the upper layer temperature derived from the drifter experiment in 2012-2014. The drifters equipped with the thermal chains made it possible to measure temperature in the upper layer up to 80 m. The data covering the cold period (December - March) and obtained in five sub-regions in the Rim Current zone in the western and eastern parts of the sea were analyzed. The sub-regions were chosen proceeding from absence of the synoptic and mesoscale eddies in them. In each sub-region, the drifter position was estimated relative to the core of the Rim Current. Based on the mean daily sea temperature, the thermocline profiles were constructed, the thermocline boundaries, depth of the upper mixed layer lower boundary, the thermocline thickness and the temperature gradient in it were determined. The analysis showed that in case of a slow increase (decrease) in the current velocity, in all the subregions, there were a deepening (rise) of the upper mixed layer lower boundary, a decrease (increase) in the thermocline thickness and an increase (decrease) of the temperature gradient in it. This process is explained by possible propagation of the internal waves induced by the Rim Current velocity varying in the thermocline. Conclusions. The results obtained showed that the fluctuation of the Rim Current velocity increased (decreased) the depth of the upper mixed layer lower boundary, the change of which was associated with an increase (decrease) in the thermocline thickness and in the temperature gradient in it. The drifters' data are significantly noisy due to the spatial inhomogeneities of the temperature field in the sea upper layer. Therefore, to obtain more accurate estimates of the processes, a study at the anchored measuring platforms installed in the zone of the Rim Current action is required.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0928-5105,1573-160X,,,,,2022,29,1,,,,,67,82,,10.22449/1573-160X-2022-1-67-82,http://dx.doi.org/10.22449/1573-160X-2022-1-67-82,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000767309800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In such lakes the reduced diversity of metazoans contrasts with a rich microbial assemblage, making these systems amenable to the study of predation controls on the microbial food web. However, the diet of B. poppei is subject to conflicting reports, with little information on feeding rates. We incubated this species in water from Sombre Lake, a much-studied maritime Antarctic Lake on the South Orkney Islands, in order to quantify its feeding rates and potential impact on the microbial assemblage. Overall, clearance rates were similar across 4 experiments spanning November 1999-March 2000, but increased with prey size over the range of 2.7-18 mu m equivalent spherical diameter (esd). B. poppei fed omnivorously, although small phototrophic flagellates comprised the bulk of the diet because of their overwhelming dominance in the incubation water. Larger motile preys-heterotrophic ciliates of similar to 18 mu m esd-were cleared fastest (mean 555 ml mg(-1) dry mass day(-1)) and at equivalent rates to those found for freshwater and marine copepods of similar size and at similar temperatures. Estimated predation impact on the microbial food web varied with the abundance of copepods; these were similar to 30-fold greater in March than in December. In March even the relatively abundant B. poppei (1.7 adults l(-1)) had a negligible impact on nanoflagellates, due to the low clearance rate on these small cells. However, in March, B. poppei adults were estimated to clear 24% of the lake water of ciliates daily.

The specific growth rate (SGR) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in T1 and T2 than in T3. The best feed conversion ratio (FCR) was obtained by fish in T2, followed by those in T1 and T3. Survival was slightly higher in T1 and T2 than in T3, but no significant differences were recognized among the treatments. Despite this, the significantly highest gross and net productions of snakehead were obtained at the highest density (T3) and the lowest at the lowest density (T1).

The BS model is based on a pressure loop and on an integral approach to the heat transfer along the vertical channel. It considers buoyancy as a function of the average temperature in the channel. The wind action is taken into account by means of wind pressure coefficients (Cp) on the facade openings. The focus of this study is the experimental validation of the modeling core: the natural ventilation through the DSF. The validation is based on the dataset of the experimental campaign conducted on a DSF test facility, the Cube, in Denmark, under IEA ECBCS ANNEX 43/SHC Task 34. Hourly simulations were performed with the BS model for the 15 days of the experimental campaign. A CFD modeling activity was also carried out on a selection of four cases, extracted from the experimental benchmark and representative of different temperature and pressure boundary conditions. The results show that the BS model presents a good level of agreement with the experimental data in predicting the mass flow rate and the heat removed by ventilation. Although the two experimental methods used to determine the airflow rate in the DSF cavity produce in many cases divergent results, it was possible to distinguish valid experimental results for comparison with the BS model. This was possible thanks to a thorough analysis of the experimental procedure together with the insight provided by the model into the determination of the driving wind and thermal differential pressures. In particular, by selecting only the measurements associated to sufficiently low wind fluctuations in the hourly averaged data, a good degree of correlation was found between the predicted total driving pressure and the flow measurements. Concerning the four cases investigated also by means of CFD, the agreement between the BS and CFD models is remarkable in terms of outlet temperatures and in the prediction of flow reversal.

Due to rising temperatures, intensive culture patterns, and other factors, hypoxia has become a serious problem for Chinese abalone aquaculture, especially in Fujian Province. A hypoxia-tolerant strain is needed for the sustainable development of abalone farming. However, it is problematic to evaluate hypoxia tolerance in abalone. Usually, the traditional analyses cause severe damages to the sampled individuals, possibly including disorders in gonad development or death and these samples could hardly be used for breeding. Here, it was found that abalone heart rates characteristically exhibited a sharp decline below a certain DO threshold, which can be referred to as the breakpoint of dissolved oxygen (BPDO). The BPDOs were sensitive to temperature - the higher acclimation temperature or experimental temperature would increase BPDO. To verify the utility of BPDO as an indicator of hypoxia tolerance in abalone, an acute stress test was conducted with 32 abalone individuals under severe hypoxia (similar to 0.5 mg/L) and significant negative correlations between BPDO and attachment duration, and between BPDO and survival time were found. The BPDO method was advantageous, as it supported individual detection and survival, which allows the selection and retention of hypoxic-tolerant individuals for further genetic breeding.

One potential way to control this pest is the sterile insect technique (SIT) which demands a large stock of reproductive females to produce millions of sterile males to be released on demand. Unfortunately, Drosophila stocks age quickly, show declining fecundity when maintained at warm temperatures and conversely, they die from chill injury if they are maintained at constant low temperature. Here we investigate the potential of fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) as a storage method that harness the benefits of both warm and cold storage. Using a FTR with a daily warm period (1 h 20 at 25 degrees C) and cold period (20 h at 3 degrees C), interspaced by gradual heating and cooling, we compared longevity, fecundity and physiological condition between FTR females and females exposed to constant 25 degrees C and 3 degrees C. As hypothesised, FTR flies experienced much slower senescence (> 3-fold increase in lifespan) and they preserved fecundity to a much higher age than flies from constant 25 degrees C. Flies maintained at constant 3 degrees C quickly died from chill injuries caused by a gradual loss of ion and water balance. In contrast, FTR flies were able to maintain ion and water balance (similar to 25 degrees C flies) as they were allowed to recover homeostasis during the short warm periods. Together these results demonstrate that FTR represents a useful protocol for storage of Drosophila stocks, and more broadly, this shows that the benefits of FTR are tightly linked with the insect ability to recover physiological homeostasis during the short warm periods.",,,,,"Overgaard, Johannes/AAA-3922-2022; Overgaard, Johannes/I-7493-2013; colinet, hervé/K-8768-2019","Overgaard, Johannes/0000-0002-2851-4551; Kuhlmann Andersen, Mads/0000-0002-6215-8941",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1910,1879-1611,,,,FEB-MAR,2019,113,,,,,,33,41,,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.01.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2019.01.001,,,,,,,,30615858,,,,,WOS:000463121900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experimental group differed from the controls, because the cool logger egg could have been introduced at any point in the incubation cycle, not just at the beginning. Egg temperature in the experimental group had a parabolic relationship with day of incubation, because parents receiving a logger egg during the third quarter of incubation showed an exaggerated heating response during the subsequent two days.

For example, wider thermal tolerance breadths are associated with more climatically variable habitats and viviparity could be associated with greater vulnerability relative to oviparity. However, few examples exist detailing how such physiological and environmental traits together might shape species thermal performance. In this study we compared the thermal tolerance and performance of two sympatric skink congeners in Hong Kong that differ in habitat use and reproductive mode. The viviparous Sphenomorphus indicus lives on the forest floor while the oviparous Sphenomorphus incognitos occupies stream edges. We quantified the thermal environments in each of these habitats to compare climatic exposure and then calculated thermal safety margins, potential daily activity times within each species' thermal optimal range, and possible climate change vulnerability. Although we did not detect any differences in thermal tolerance range or thermal environments across habitats, we found cooler performance in S. indicus relative to S. incognitos. Moreover, while optimal activity time increases for both skinks under a warming scenario, we project that the thermal safety margin of S. indicus would narrow to nearly zero, thus losing its buffering capacity to potential extreme climate events in the future. This research is thus consistent with recent studies emphasizing the vulnerability of viviparous reptiles to a warming climate. The results together furthermore highlight the complexity in how environmental and physiological traits at multiple spatial scales structure climate change vulnerability of ectothermic species.

A total of 132 fish species from 65 families were collected from the 120 trawl shots. Degens leatherjacket, Thamnaconus degeni, was the most abundant species collected (627 +/- 239 ha(-1)). This fish was also dominant in terms of biomass, and accounted for more than 40% of the total catch weight. Most other species (95%) had mean biomasses ranging from less than 1 to 515 g ha-1, and individually contributed less than 3% to the overall catch. Correlation analyses revealed a broad latitudinal gradient in fish abundance, biomass and richness. All three parameters generally increase towards the south of the Gulf, in association with increasing water depths and decreasing water temperatures. Multivariate cluster analyses confirmed the presence of a strong environmental gradient between the north and south of the Gulf, and highlight the presence of three distinct fish assemblages (north, central and south) that are closely allied with changes in depth. Small subsets of species with restricted distributions characterised each regional assemblage. Dietary examinations of the stomach contents of 871 fish representing 107 species were also undertaken during this study. Five feeding guilds were identified from cluster analysis of the stomach contents. These included groups of fish feeding primarily on echinoderms (2 spp), other fish (13 spp), molluscs (11 spp), crustaceans (52 spp) and worms (23 spp). Atrophic model was constructed to evaluate levels of food consumption for each fish, and to assess regional differences in the composition and total volume of prey eaten. Total food consumption was estimated to decrease progressively towards the top of the Gulf, with daily food consumption rates in the northern region (219.55 g ha(-1) day(-1)) more than seven times lower than those in the south of the Gulf (1580.99 g ha(-1) day(-1)). Crustaceans and annelids were the two most important prey items consumed by demersal fish in all three biomes of the Spencer Gulf (north, central, south), and comprised more than 30% and 18% of the total diet, respectively. Our model suggests that almost half a kilogram of crustaceans and worms are consumed daily per hectare in the south of the Gulf. All other prey groups (e. g. molluscs, bryozoans, echinoderms, sponges) are eaten in much smaller volumes, and are individually consumed at daily rates of less than 127 g ha(-1) in each biome. Estimates of consumption were broadly consistent with other temperate Australian estuaries. However, as no seasonal replication of sampling was undertaken it remains unclear if observed spatial patterns and trends are temporally robust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0372-1426,,,,,NOV,2010,134,,2,,,,198,227,,10.1080/3721426.2010.10887143,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/3721426.2010.10887143,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000287964900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

To date, most reported effects of corridors have been positive; however, there are long-standing concerns that corridors may have unintended consequences. Here, we address concerns over whether corridors promote propagation of disturbances such as fire. We collected data during prescribed fires in the world's largest and best replicated corridor experiment (Savannah River Site, South Carolina, USA), six similar to 50-ha landscapes of open (shrubby/herbaceous) habitat within a pine plantation matrix, to test several mechanisms for how corridors might influence fire. Corridors altered patterns of fire temperature through a direct connectivity effect and an indirect edge effect. The connectivity effect was independent of fuel levels and was consistent with a hypothesized wind-driven bellows effect. Edges, a consequence of corridor implementation, elevated leaf litter (fuel) input from matrix pine trees, which in turn increased fire temperatures. We found no evidence for corridors or edges impacting patterns of fire spread: plots across all landscape positions burned with similar probability. Impacts of edges and connectivity on fire temperature led to changes in vegetation: hotter-burning plots supported higher bunch grass cover during the field season after burning, suggesting implications for woody/herbaceous species coexistence. To our knowledge, this represents the first experimental evidence that corridors can modify landscape-scale patterns of fire intensity. Corridor impacts on fire should be carefully considered during landscape management, both in the context of how corridors connect or break distributions of fuels and the desired role of fire as a disturbance, which may range from a management tool to an agent to be suppressed. In our focal ecosystem, longleaf pine woodland, corridors might provide a previously unrecognized benefit during prescribed burning activities, by promoting fire intensity, which may assist in promoting plant biodiversity.",,,,,"Damschen, Ellen/E-4919-2011","Damschen, Ellen/0000-0001-7435-0669",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,APR,2012,22,3,,,,,937,946,,10.1890/11-1026.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-1026.1,,,,,,,,22645822,,,,,WOS:000303312000016,View Full Record in Web of Science

During torpor, the relationship between f(H) and T-a was curvilinear, and at low T-sub (similar to 6 degrees C), f(H) fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min-1. The minimum average values for both V-O2 and f(H) in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between f(H) and V-O2 was significant for both resting (r(2)=0.64, P<0.001) and torpid bats (r(2)=0.84, P<0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly correlated (r(2)=0.44, P<0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of V-O2 from f(H) did not differ significantly from measured values during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of f(H) as a predictor of V-O2 during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential measure of energy expenditure in the field. Nevertheless, f(H) should only be used to predict V-O2 within the range of activities for which robust correlations have been established.",,,,,"Geiser, Fritz/O-4175-2018; Currie, Shannon E/P-2214-2018","Geiser, Fritz/0000-0001-7621-5049; Currie, Shannon E/0000-0001-5956-0481; Koertner, Gerhard/0000-0001-8230-0709",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAY,2014,217,9,,,,,1519,1524,,10.1242/jeb.098970,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.098970,,,,,,,,24436390,,,,,WOS:000335583500021,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presented an experiment to compare the thermal comfort performance of radiant heating system with convective heating system through objective measurement and subjective survey. Six physical parameters which might influence occupants' thermal satisfaction, including the Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT), humidity, air movement, A-weighted sound level, temperature fluctuation and vertical temperature difference, were measured. In addition, 97 subjects participated in the subjective survey part of this experiment, experiencing all the three environments heated by air source heat pump, radiator and floor heating. And they were asked to vote in six thermal comfort related aspects, i.e. thermal sensation, humidity, draught, local discomfort, overall thermal satisfaction and overall preferences, plus the acoustic environment, since the operation noise of heating system might lead to complains of the occupants. It was found that in continuous heating, no significant difference between radiant and convective heating system was observed in the Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT), indoor humidity and noise issue. Though radiant heating systems resulted in lower draught risk and less local discomfort complains in the feet region due to the less significant temperature fluctuations and vertical temperature gradients, radiant heating did not have significantly higher overall thermal satisfaction votes and was not significantly more preferred by occupants.

Newly eclosed male and female adults E. quadripustulatus from previously field collected pupae were studied for the lifespan of adults under different constant temperatures (15 and 20 degrees C) and naturally fluctuating (ambient) temperatures using starved (no food), liquid diets (water, and 10% honey solution) and natural prey (mussel scale Lepidosaphes ulmi L.) on apple. Access to distilled water compared to starvation did not increase the longevity of adult but significantly prolonged the life span when honey solution was provided. Longevity in constant conditions and ambient depended on both temperature and food. Coccinellid E. quadripustulatus survived longer time (>= 10 months) under field conditions on natural prey L. ulmi than under constant temperature (<= 4 months). Prey L. ulmi was the best food for survival than 10% honey solution. The degree of adaptability (hysteresis) of adult E. quadripustulatus at alternating temperature regimes (ascending and descending) showed significant differences in feeding at decreasing temperature than increasing ones. The results indicate that, in natural conditions, the adult beetles may be well adapted if they are introduced to different climatic regions where it has not yet been tested. Still more detailed information is to be investigated to prove this hypothesis. Results on diapause termination of female adult E. quadripustulatus showed that temperature did not effect diapause termination under the present experimental conditions.

The minimal model to which these data can be fitted in a statistically significant and physically meaningful way comprises four different Lorentzian bands with frequencies at 197, 209, 218, and 226 cm(-1), and a Gaussian band at 240 cm(-1), which exhibit halfwidths between 10 and 12.5 cm(-1). All these parameters were assumed to be independent of temperature. The temperature dependence of the apparent total band shape's frequency is attributed to an intensity redistribution of the subbands at Omega(1) = 209 cm(-1), Omega(2) = 218 cm(-1), and Omega(3) = 226 cm(-1), which are assigned to Fe-N-E(His(F8)) stretching modes in different conformational substates of the Fe-His(F8) linkage. They comprise different out-of-plane displacements of the heme iron, The two remaining bands at 197 and 240 cm(-1) result from porphyrin modes. Their intensity ratio is nearly temperature independent. The intensity ratio I-3/I-2 of the nu(Fe-His) subbands exhibits a van't Hoff behavior between 150 and 300 K, bending over in a region between 150 and 80 K, and remains constant between 80 and 10 K, whereas I-2/I-1 shows a maximum at 170 K and approaches a constant value at 80 K. These data can be fitted by a modified van't Hoff expression, which accounts for the freezing into a non-equilibrium distribution of substates below a distinct temperature T-f and also for the linear temperature dependence of the specific heat of proteins. The latter leads to a temperature dependence of the entropic and enthalpic differences between conformational substates. The fits to the intensity ratios of the nu(Fe-His) subbands yield a freezing temperature of T-f = 117 K and a transition region of Delta T = 55 K, in comparison we have utilized the above thermodynamic model to reanalyze earlier data on the temperature dependence of the ratio A(0)/A(1) of two subbands underlying the infrared absorption band of the CO stretching vibration in CO-ligated myoglobin (A. Ansari, J. Berendzen, D. Braunstein, B. R. Cowen, H. Frauenfelder, M. K. Kong, I. E. T. Iben, J. Johnson, P. Ormos, T. B. Sauke, R. Scholl, A. Schulte, P. J. Steinbach, R. D. Vittitow, and R. D. Young, 1987, Biophys. Chem. 26:237-335). This yields thermodynamic parameters, in particular the freezing temperature (T-f = 231 K) and the width of the transition region (Delta T = 8 K), which are significantly different from the corresponding parameters obtained from the above nu(Fe-His) data, but very close to values describing the transition of protein bound water from a liquid into an amorphous state. These findings and earlier reported data on the temperature dependence exhibited by the Soret absorption bands of various deoxy and carbonmonoxymyoglobins led us to the conclusion that the fluctuations between conformational substates of the heme environment in carbonmonoxymyoglobin are strongly coupled to motions within the hydration shell, whereas the thermal motions between the substates of the Fe-His(F8) linkage in deoxymyoglobin proceed on an energy landscape that is mainly determined by the intrinsic properties of the protein. The latter differ from protein fluctuations monitored by Mossbauer experiments on deoxymyoglobin crystals which exhibit a strong coupling to the protein bound water and most probably reflect a higher tier in the hierarchical arrangement of substates and equilibrium fluctuations.",,,,,"Schweitzer-Stenner, Reinhard/AAV-1058-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3495,,,,,JUL,1995,69,1,,,,,214,227,,10.1016/S0006-3495(95)79893-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(95)79893-9,,,,,,,,7669899,,,,,WOS:A1995RH66100021,View Full Record in Web of Science

One hundred sixty five cubic Vexar cages (10 x 10 x 10 cm) filled with 150 g (wet weight) of dead hydroids (Tubularia larynx) perisarcs were deployed and retrieved using a sequential time exposure schedule [collectors were deployed in decreasing numbers (30 to 5) every approximate to 5 days and retrieved in the reverse order (5 to 30) of their immersion]. This approach gave independent samples with respect to time and made it possible to estimate (1) near instantaneous settlement density, (2) short-term post-settlement mortality, (3) cumulative collection efficiency, and to compare (4) settlement onto substrata immersed for different periods of time. Simultaneous measurement of environmental factors (tidal range, current speed, seawater temperature and salinity) allowed an assessment of the relative influence of environmental factors in determining settlement density. The spat collectors used in this study were successful in collecting many thousands of Iceland scallop post-larvae. Settlement took place during 1 month, from the middle of September to the middle of October 1992 and collectors immersed for 10, 15, and 20 days collected significantly more spat than those immersed for 5 days. After the settlement season, spat mortality remained low for at least an additional 25 days (the end of the observation period). The daily mean density (DMD) of newly settled spat during each approximate to 5-day interval varied significantly in time and there was no significant correlation between DMD and the environmental factors. Different hypotheses concerning larval flux (no. of larvae x mean current speed) and their probability of coming into contact and being retained by a collector (retention efficiency) are proposed to explain the temporal pattern of spat collection observed in this study. Some suggestions are made to enhance collection efficiency of artificial scallop spat collectors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,,,,,DEC 29,1995,194,2,,,,,167,187,,10.1016/0022-0981(95)00092-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(95)00092-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995TU55100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The 4 dK levels corresponded to DEB values of 200, 240, 280, and 320 mEq/kg, respectively. Each of the 8 dietary treatments was randomly allocated to 4 replicates with 46 birds per replicate. The experimental diets were prepared separately for each phase, i.e., prestarter (d 1-10), starter (d 11-20), grower (d 21-33), and finisher (d 34-42). Analyzed water characteristics (pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, and total dissolved solids) and electrolytes were found within the recommended range. Feed intake (P=0.05), daily water intake (P=0.04), and mortality (P=0.02) were increased by replacing K2CO3 with K2SO4. The source and level interaction was found to affect litter moisture (P=0.04). Either varying levels or replacing salts of dK did not result in improved growth performance that was mainly associated with the simultaneously reduced capacity of the digestive (gizzard and proventriculus) and lymphoid (bursa and spleen) organs of the body. The dK and changing salt (K2CO3 with K2SO4) resulted in a greater dressing percentage (P=0.008), abdominal fat (P=0.03), and blood pH (P=0.01) but did not affect body, breast, and thigh weights. Increasing serum K, Na, and HCO3 were compensated with reduced serum Ca and Cl in higher dK diets. It is inferred that lower levels of dK (i.e., 0.86%) could be used to enhance broiler growth. The supplementation of K2SO4 improved feed and water intake, but reduced livability.

Knowledge of factors controlling the variability in evapotranspiration is crucial for the prediction of the fate of terrestrial ecosystems under environmental changes. Based on long-term (2005-2014) eddy covariance flux data observed at a rainfed maize site in northeast China, the purpose of this study was to clarify the environmental regulation of actual evapotranspiration (ET) and the extent to which the regulatory effects on ET are directly or indirectly mediated by changes in biotic factors, using the structural equation modeling (SEM) method. The results showed that annual total ET was 397 35 mm for the rainfed maize site in comparison with 575 +/- 169 mm of precipitation (Prec), with an ET/Prec ratio ranging from 0.43 (2012) to 1.14 (2014). It was revealed that net radiation (Rn) was the primary controlling factor of the maize ET, followed by leaf area index (LAI), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature (Ta), and soil water content (SWC). The adjusted SEM models explained 71%, 67%, and 67% of the variation in daily ET of the maize growing season (ETgs) for dry, normal, and moist years, respectively. Rn and VPD dominated ETgs in an increasing order of dry, normal, and moist years. Conversely, the effects of LAI and Ta on ETg, followed the opposite trend. This indicated that drought may increase the sensitivity of maize ET to temperature changes, and decrease the sensitivity of maize ET to radiation changes. In SEM analysis, LAI played an important mediating role in the relationship among climate, soil variables, and ETgs. Rn, VPD, Ta, and SWC all had significant indirect effects on ETgs mediated through LAI. At the annual scale, it was identified that most active days could be a robust predictor of annual ET.",,,,,"王, 宇/C-5531-2008","Wang, Yu/0000-0003-2085-0064",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-3774,1873-2283,,,,JUL 20,2019,221,,,,,,538,546,,10.1016/j.agwat.2019.05.026,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.05.026,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000472698600051,View Full Record in Web of Science

It may be considered as a prominent example of the ability of proteins (including enzymes) to provide global entropy in a local process. In this work new experiments and model calculations are reported which aim at finding the structural elements contributing to the reaction entropy. Geometrical studies prove the implication of the 20 residue E-helix being shifted by more than 2 angstrom. Vibrational entropies are calculated by a procedure' derived from the method of Karplus and Kushik.

Tangaroa east of South Island, New Zealand, in late March-early April 2004. A desktop survey of climatological data was completed before the experiment, providing information to inform site selection and experiment design. The desktop survey is presented here in updated and enhanced form in order to explain the site selection and describe the conditions expected at the site during the experiment in comparison with those actually encountered. The experiment site was in Subantarctic waters between the Subtropical and Subantarctic Fronts. These waters are characterised by high surface macronutrient concentration, low iron concentration and low chlorophyll. The preferred site based on the desktop survey was in the vicinity of 173.5 degrees E, 47.5 degrees S, in Southern Bounty Trough. The actual release location was chosen immediately before the release and was 112 km to the northwest of this at 172 degrees 32'E, 46 degrees 44'S. The surface water here has typically come from the southwest (over the northern Campbell Plateau) or the southeast (through Pukaki Gap) and the mean current is directed towards ENE at similar to 0.1 m s(-1). The release location is well removed from regions of high eddy kinetic energy to the east (where the Subantarctic Front reaches its northern limit) and the west (where fine-scale instabilities develop on the Southland Front, which flows along the continental shelf). Typical conditions at the release site at the end of March are: surface temperature 12 degrees C; mixed layer depth 40 m; surface chlorophyll concentration similar to 0.3 mg m(-3); surface photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) 23 E m(-2) d(-1); surface nutrient concentrations 8-10 mmol m(-3) (nitrate), 0.5-0.8 mmol m(-3) (phosphate), 1-2 mmol m(-3) (silicate) and 0.1-0.5 nM (iron); 99th percentile wind speed 19-21 m s(-1). At this time of year, surface PAR is well below its summer maximum, the mixed layer is beginning its seasonal deepening and the silicate concentration is at its seasonal minimum. These factors may have limited the phytoplankton response to iron addition and were compounded in March-April 2004 by strong winds early in the experiment (substantially exceeding the 99th percentile in speed), lower than the average SST, larger than the average mixed layer depth, silicate concentration at the bottom end of the expected range and initially low PAR.

Two distinct conformations of the CO-ligated protein were identified, giving rise to two stretching bands of heme-bound CO. If L29W MbCO crystals are illuminated around 180 K, a deoxy species is formed. The CO molecules migrate to the proximal side of the heme and remain trapped in the so-called Xe1 cavity upon temperature decrease to 105 K. The structure of this photoproduct is almost identical to the equilibrium high-temperature deoxy Mb structure. If the temperature is cycled to increasingly higher values, CO recombination is observed. Three intermediate structures have been determined during the rebinding process.

Our results revealed a significant interaction effect of warming, precipitation, and galls on the life-history traits of the focal species. Specifically, when the galls were intact, warming had no effect on the phenology and increased the mortality of the fly under decreased precipitation, but it significantly advanced the timing of adult emergence and had no effect on the mortality under increased precipitation. When galls were removed, warming significantly advanced the timing of emergence and increased fly mortality, but precipitation showed no effect on the phenology and mortality. In addition, gall removal significantly increased adult fresh mass for both females and males.

In this study, four large-scale subgrade models with different initial soil moisture contents, fine contents were subjected to freeze-thaw action by bringing the soil surfaces exposed to air temperature fluctuating between -15 and 15 degrees C. The results show that soil moisture migration occurs in both frozen and unfrozen soils during the freeze-thaw cycle.

Crushed rock with 50% fines content produced visual deformation, and the maximum amount of frost heave was 12.1 mm under external loading, comparable with the results from the previous field investigation. The unfrozen water content of fills decreases gradually with the depression of soil temperature. Some liquid water remained unfrozen at the end of the freezing period with residual unfrozen water content between 0.07 m(3) M-3 and 0.10 m(3) m(-3), and continuing to exist even at - 8.7 degrees C.

The impacts of assimilating the radiances from different instruments (e.g., AMSU-A, AMSU-B and HIRS) were measured in comparison to the control run. The assimilation experiments for July 2008 (30 cases) demonstrated a positive impact of the assimilated ATOVS radiance on both the analysis state as well as subsequent short-range forecasts. Relative to the control run, the moisture analysis was improved with the assimilation of AMSU-B and HIRS radiance, while AMSU-A was mainly responsible for improved temperature analysis. The comparison of the model-predicted temperature, moisture and wind with NCEP analysis indicated that a positive forecast impact is achieved from each of the three instruments. HIRS and AMSU-A radiance yielded only a slight positive forecast impact, while AMSU-B radiance had the largest positive forecast impact for moisture, temperature and wind. The comparison of model-predicted rainfall with observed rainfall indicates that ATOVS radiance, particularly AMSU-B and HIRS, impacted the rainfall positively.

We herein evaluated the biochemical responses to contrasting environmental conditions of the early ontogenetic stages of two coastal crabs from the Southeast Pacific coast: Petrolisthes laevigatus and Allopetrolisthes punctatus. For this purpose, stage I embryos of both species were subjected to two treatments: (1) emersion (i.e., a daily 3 h aerial exposure until the zoeas hatched) and (2) immersion (i.e., uninterrupted underwater submersion until the zoeas hatched); the total contents of glucose, proteins, lipids, and fatty acids of the organisms were measured in stage I embryos and recently hatched zoeas in order to assess the biochemical constitution of the two species. Both species showed changes in their energetic reserves when treatments within species were compared. Our results found that A. punctatus was negatively affected by stressful periods of emersion, while P. laevigatus showed the opposite tendency and was affected by periods of immersion.

This was done under laboratory conditions in cages, each with 2-3 laying hens, initially 300 poultry red mites and later the release of 1,000 predators. These small-scale tests were designed to prevent mite escape from the cages and they were carried out in three replicates at each of three temperature regimes: 26, 30 (constant day and night) and 33-25 degrees C (day-night cycle). After 6 weeks total population sizes of poultry red mites and predatory mites were assessed. For the temperature regimes of 26 and 33/25 degrees C S. scimitus reduced the poultry red mite population relative to the control experiments by a factor 3 and 30, respectively, and A. casalis by a factor of 18 and 55, respectively. At 30 degrees C the predators had less effect on red mites, with a reduction of 1.3-fold for S. scimitus and 5.6-fold for A. casalis. This possibly reflected hen manure condition or an effect of other invertebrates in the hen feed. Poultry red mite control was not negatively affected by temperatures as high as 33 degrees C and was always better in trials with A. casalis than in those with S. scimitus. In none of the experiments predators managed to eradicate the population of poultry red mites. This may be due to a prey refuge effect since most predatory mites were found in and around the manure tray at the bottom of the cage, whereas most poultry red mites were found higher up in the cage (i.e. on the walls, the cover, the perch, the nest box and the food box). The efficacy of applying predatory mites in the poultry industry may be promoted by reducing this refuge effect, boosting predatory mite populations using alternative prey and prolonged predator release devices. Biocontrol success, however, will strongly depend on how the poultry is housed in practice (free range, cage or aviary systems) and on which chemicals are applied to disinfect poultry houses and to control other pests.",,,,,"Komdeur, Jan/X-1261-2019","Komdeur, Jan/0000-0002-9241-0124",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-8162,,,,,DEC,2012,58,4,,,,,371,383,,10.1007/s10493-012-9596-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-012-9596-z,,,,,,,,22773110,,,,,WOS:000310587900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Twelve carcasses were monitored in systematic visits till total depletion (N=303). Thirteen species of birds and mammals utilized bison carcasses. Most frequent scavengers and their mean scavenging frequencies (mean percentage of visits to each carcass with a given scavenger species recorded) were raven, Corvus corax, 72%; red fox, Vulpes vulpes, 41%; wolf, Canis lupus, 29%; common buzzard, Buteo buteo, 23%; raccoon dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides, 20%; and white-tailed eagle, Haliaeetus albicilla, 16%. Ravens and white-tailed eagles were observed significantly more often at carcasses placed in clearings than at those exposed in the forest. The opposite was recorded for raccoon dogs. Manifest habitat segregation was also found for flocks of immature ravens and territorial pairs. Wolves had an important facilitation effect for other species and triggered their scavenging activity. Bison carcasses were utilized for an average of 106 +/- 61 days (mean +/- SD), to over 80% of live weight consumed. The estimated mean daily consumption by all scavengers was 3 kg da(y-)1 (range 0-68), being highest during the first 2 weeks (6.8 +/- 6.2 kg day(-1)). The utilization time of bison carcasses depended on the index of carcass openness. the number of wolf feeding visits to the carcass, the date of carcass exposure, and the habitat type (forest versus open clearings).

Temperature dependence of egg development of Dinocras cephalotes (Curtis) (three German and one Norwegian population) and Slovenian D. megacephala (Klapalek) was studied under a constant 14:10 light:dark photoperiod and constant temperature ranges of 4-24 degrees C and 4-18 degrees C, respectively. D. cephalotes was also incubated under seasonal field conditions; natural daylength and fluctuating temperatures had no modifying effect. 2. Both species have very similar lower threshold temperatures (4 and 3.5 degrees C, respectively), thermal demand for development (c. 600 degree days) and high dependence of mean incubation period on temperature (exponents of regressions near 1.5). Present data on D. cephalotes agree with the literature on British and Norwegian material of the same species. 3. Development occurs only at cue temperatures above the lower threshold. Cue temperatures range from 6 degrees C (some D. megacephala) to 14 degrees C (some D, cephalotes) and vary strongly within and between egg masses of D. cephalotes. Variation is not random, but seems to be genetically determined. 4. The variable temperature response renders study of effects of particular experimental regimes, and comparisons between local populations, difficult. 5. A latitudinal gradient in cue temperatures for development from 6 degrees C at c. 46 degrees N to 12 or even 14 degrees C at c. 61 degrees N seems to reflect reduced diversity at high latitudes. 6. Average success of spontaneous hatching exceeded 90% between 12 and 20 degrees C, but declined towards higher and lower temperatures. 7. Unhatched eggs were not dead but in parapause; development at other, higher or lower, temperatures was induced. Spontaneous plus induced hatching success approached 90%. Developing eggs rarely died; most dead eggs were apparently unfertilized. 8. Dormant plecopteran eggs are proposed to form a seed bank in stream bed sediments. Highly successful development after up to 220 days of dormancy was ascertained in Dinocras, and survival for up to 3 years is reported for other Perloidea. 9.

In Indonesia, the first signs of bleaching were reported in April 2016. However, this El Nino has impacted Indonesian coral reefs since 2015 through a different process than temperature-induced bleaching. In September 2015, altimetry data show that sea level was at its lowest in the past 12 years, affecting corals living in the bathymetric range exposed to unusual emersion. In March 2016, Bunaken Island (North Sulawesi) displayed up to 85% mortality on reef flats dominated by Porites, Heliopora and Goniastrea corals with differential mortality rates by coral genus. Almost all reef flats showed evidence of mortality, representing 30% of Bunaken reefs. For reef flat communities which were living at a depth close to the pre-El Nino mean low sea level, the fall induced substantial mortality likely by higher daily aerial exposure, at least during low tide periods. Altimetry data were used to map sea level fall throughout Indonesia, suggesting that similar mortality could be widespread for shallow reef flat communities, which accounts for a vast percent of the total extent of coral reefs in Indonesia. The altimetry historical records also suggest that such an event was not unique in the past two decades, therefore rapid sea level fall could be more important in the dynamics and resilience of Indonesian reef flat communities than previously thought. The clear link between mortality and sea level fall also calls for a refinement of the hierarchy of El Nino impacts and their consequences on coral reefs.",,,,,"Birol, Florence/R-9791-2016; menkes, christophe/X-6073-2019; Ouillon, Sylvain/A-6292-2012; menkes, christophe/H-9085-2016","Birol, Florence/0000-0002-7475-6017; menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; Ouillon, Sylvain/0000-0001-7964-7787; menkes, christophe/0000-0002-1457-9696; NINO, Fernando/0000-0002-0388-8100; Ampou, Eghbert Elvan/0000-0003-0991-1153; Johan, M.Sc, Dr. Ofri/0000-0003-3772-9586",,,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,FEB 24,2017,14,4,,,,,817,826,,10.5194/bg-14-817-2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-817-2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000395321500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Numerous micrometeorological methods have become commercially available. Considering the eventual trade-off between cost and accuracy, it is important to evaluate these methods to provide recommendations for practical purposes. Therefore, we tested five different techniques at one field in the region of Central Europe dominated by rainfed farming but suffers from drought spells. In an intensive campaign, we used eddy covariance (EC), large aperture and surface layer scintillometers, the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB), and the surface renewal (SR) methods to estimate the sensible (H) and latent (lambda ET) heat fluxes of winter wheat and bare soil with harvest residues during two months in summer 2015. At the half-hourly level, the methods showed varying agreement under different field conditions. While H estimated by EC and scintillometry agreed well, there was an underestimation of lambda ET by EC compared to the other methods, most likely due to energy balance non-closure. The lambda LET estimated by the BREB method showed good agreement with the lambda ET obtained by scintillometry when the Bowen ratio (beta) was high and with the lambda ET obtained by EC when beta -> 0. Our study confirmed good reliability of scintillometers across wide range of meteorological conditions. Although the SR method provided the most inferior agreement with other methods at half-hourly basis, it was deemed to be valuable when longer averaging periods were used. Over the entire experiment, mean daily ET estimated by scintillometry (2.6 mm d(-5)), BREB (2.3 mm d(-1)), and SR (2.9 mm d(-1)) showed reasonable agreement while EC (1.6 mm d(-1)) significantly underestimated. This indicates that low cost methods (BREB and SR) are sufficient for water management purposes when a daily and longer time scales are important.

Equal amino acid nitrogen was maintained by replacing lysine with glutamic acid. Triplicate groups of 20 fish (initial weight 5.50 +/- 1.63 g) were fed to apparent satiation by hand twice daily for 10 weeks in floating sea cages. The water temperature ranged from 27 to 30 degrees C, the salinity from 25 parts per thousand to 28 parts per thousand and the dissolved oxygen content was approximately 7 mg l(-1) during the experimental period. Fish fed diets with lysine from 1.28% to 4.25% (diets 1-6) all showed high survival (above 95%) and no significant differences were observed. Final weight (FW) and specific growth rate (SGR) increased with increasing dietary lysine level up to 2.46%, and thereafter, remained nearly the same. Both feed efficiency ratio (FER) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) in fish fed diets with lysine from 2.46% to 3.66% (diets 3-5) were significantly higher than those in fish fed diets with lysine of 1.28%, 1.86% and 4.25% (P < 0.01). The whole body crude protein and crude lipid contents were significantly affected (P < 0.01) by dietary lysine level, while moisture and ash showed no significant differences. The whole body protein content was positively correlated with dietary lysine levels, while lipid content was negatively correlated with it. Lysine contents of fish muscle were significantly affected by dietary lysine levels (P < 0.05). Fish fed the diet with 1.28% lysine showed the lowest lysine content (7.61%) in fish muscle, while fish fed the diet with 3.66% lysine had the highest value (7.83%).

Striped bass distribution within the tailwater was similar during each diel-tracking event and across both summers. The majority of fish remained within the tailwater the entire summer; however, some made periodic excursions to and from the tailwater throughout the summer. Further, most striped bass were located within 0.5 kin of Richard B. Russell Dam during all stages of operation on all occasions-probably because of the constant availability of optimal habitat during all three stages of operation on all diel-tracking events. The diel cycle of dam operation, which included pumped storage during each summer, did not degrade tailwater habitat below optimal conditions, according to summer habitat suitability index values for inland adult striped bass. Movement was significantly higher during hydroelectric generation operations than during no-generation and pumped storage periods in summer 2003; this difference was not apparent during summer 2004. Mean absolute movement peaked during hydroelectric generation on six of eight diel-tracking events. During both summers, movement was directed up-reservoir during no-generation and generation periods and down-reservoir during pumped storage. Mean total daily movement rates ranged from 0.59 to 4.04 km/d and were greater than those previously estimated from bimonthly sampling for this population. Total daily movement rate peaked during the first tracking event each summer and then declined as summer progressed.

Five experimental diets were formulated to provide 40% crude protein and 11% dietary lipid (dry matter basis) with the yeast-based protein source replacing Special Select (R) menhaden fish meal at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of dietary protein. Ten juvenile cobia (initial weight 11.5 g fish) were randomly stocked in triplicate 300 1 circular fiberglass tanks (n = 30 treatment(-1)) and hand-fed the diets based upon total tank biomass two times daily at 0900 and 1400 h. Fish were group weighed weekly to monitor performance and adjust feeding rations. Water temperature and salinity were maintained at 27 degrees C and 15 parts per thousand, respectively. At the end of the feeding trial, weight gain, ranging from 86% to 512%, and feed conversion ratio values, ranging from 1.9 to 5.8, were significantly affected by the inclusion of the yeast-based protein source, with decreasing values as inclusion levels of the yeast-based protein source rose above 25% of dietary protein. Cobia fed the diet containing 25% of dietary protein from the yeast-based protein source had equal weight gain and feed conversion ratio values as fish fed the control diet composed of 100% fish meal (503 vs. 512 and 1.9 vs. 1.9, respectively). Biological indices including hepatosomatic index, visceral somatic index and muscle ratio were all similarly affected by inclusion of the yeast-based protein source, with significant impacts when inclusion levels rose above 25% of dietary protein. As with the weight,am and feed efficiency ratio values, fish fed the diet containing 25% of protein from the yeast-based source had similar values as those observed in the control animals. This study represents the first attempt to utilize an organically certified protein source as a replacement for fish meal in diets for juvenile cobia. Although levels of inclusion of the yeast-based protein source above 50% of dietary protein resulted in detrimental effects on production characteristics, the data clearly suggest that, at a minimum, 25% of dietary protein can be provided by this yeast-based protein in diets for cobia.

Furthermore, because responses of a species may be modified by interactions with competitors, it is informative to examine warming effects on organisms and service provision under competition. Dung beetles provide numerous services to agriculture by burying the manure of other animals. To understand the potential impacts of climate warming on ecosystem service provision, we exposed two dung beetle species (Sisyphus rubrus and Euoniticellus fulvus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae)), occurring together in the same experimental pats, to warming and measured reproduction (dung ball production and burial, brood production, and egg laying), pat departure behaviour and survival of both species. These two species are likely competitors in pastures in northern New South Wales. To simulate climate warming, we used custom-built chambers to add offsets (+0, +2 or +4 degrees C) to field recorded, diurnally fluctuating baseline temperatures. There was no direct effect of increased temperature on any measured trait in either species. We did find however that the relative survival of the two species depended on temperature; S. rubrus had a higher probability (resulting in greater odds) of surviving than E. fulvus in the +0 and +4 degrees C offset chambers, but not in the +2 degrees C offset chambers. Likewise, the relative likelihood of the different species leaving a dung pat was temperature dependent; in the +2 degrees C offset chambers, E. fulvus were more likely to leave than S. rubrus, but not in the +0 and +4 degrees C offsets chambers. Our results highlight that it may be important for future studies to consider warming effects on relative survival and emigration because such effects could potentially lead to changes in dung beetle species composition.",,,,,"; Andrew, Nigel/B-7162-2008","Holley, Jean/0000-0003-4212-5998; Andrew, Nigel/0000-0002-2850-2307",,,,,,,,,,,,,1442-9985,1442-9993,,,,AUG,2019,44,5,,,,,800,811,,10.1111/aec.12750,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.12750,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000476537200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, another but poorly studied main effect of global change appears to be an increase in temperature variability. Most of the current analyses of global change have focused on mean values, paying less attention to the role of the fluctuations of environmental variables. We tested the effects of daily thermal amplitude with constant mean (24-24 degrees C, 27-21 degrees C and 32-16 degrees C) on different performance traits (rollover speed, body mass balance and survival) in populations of woodlouse (Porcellio laevis) from two altitudes. We observed that maximum performance showed a significant effect of population in the first but not in the fifth week, and only the population effect was significant for optimum temperature. Interestingly, populations under higher amplitude in environmental temperature exhibited higher resistance to a fluctuating climatic regime. We suggest that our results indicate that thermal variability may produce important effects on biodiversity. Therefore, in order to develop more realistic scenarios of global climate change effects on biodiversity, the effects of thermal variability as well as mean need to be examined simultaneously.

Upon exposure to 5 kPa, metabolic rate and abdominal pumping rate (152 min(-1)) decreased, although the animals continued abdominal pumping at the reduced rate throughout the exposure period.

The platform was equally used to validate a coupled heat and mass transfer model for green roof behavior. The albedo of the green roof was measured and implemented in the numerical model. The developed model has been coupled to a building thermal code (TRNSYS). Then, simulations were conducted for the experimental urban canyon studied where a comparison was undertaken between green and conventional roofing. A reduction of the maximum roof surface temperature by 20 degrees C was found in summer due to the green roof. Green roof protects the roof membrane from high temperature fluctuations increasing the roof longevity and delay the timing of the peak membrane surface temperature by several hours. Also, the presence of vegetation permits to reduce the outside air temperature of the street canyon by 0.8 degrees C. Hence, green roofing is an effective solution to reduce the total energy demand and to improve the urban microclimate in the street canyon for an oceanic temperate climate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Under these conditions, light and relative humidity (RH) can fluctuate during the healing process, and growers need more research-based information regarding the impact of these factors on the survival of grafted transplants. To address this need, this study investigated the effect of different targeted levels of light (0%, 25%, and 50%) and RH (50% and 100%) (six combinations) in a small-scale healing chamber within a greenhouse, where the healing chamber was opened for increasing periods of time for 8 days, at which time plants were fully exposed to greenhouse conditions. The survival and growth of self-grafted eggplant (Solanum melongena), pepper (Capsicum annuum), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) were measured up to 25 days post grafting. Percent light in the closed healing chambers was similar for the 50% and 100% RH levels of each light treatment. When the healing chambers were closed, compared with the greenhouse, there was 0.1% light in the 0% light treatments, 25% light on average in the 25% light treatments, and 43% light on average in the 50% light treatments. On days 2 to 5 after grafting, when chambers were opened up to 1 hour, average RH in the healing chambers was 96% to 98% for the 100% RH treatments, and was 42% to 49% for the 50% RH treatments. On days 6 and 7, when chambers were opened for 3 to 8 hours, RH was 79% to 82% for the 100% RH treatments, and was 39% to 46% for the 50% RH treatments. Survival of grafted plants following healing was greatest when the healing chamber treatment was 100% RH and 50% or 25% light (95% and 90% survival, respectively), and plant survival with these two treatments did not significantly decline from 11 to 21 days after grafting, indicating plants were fully healed and acclimated when they were removed from the healing chambers on day 8. At 22 to 25 days following grafting, plants healed with 100% RH and 50% or 25% light had greater plant height, number of leaves per plant, and stem diameter than plants healed in the other light and RH combinations. SPAD reading and nitrate-nitrogen of fresh petiole sap were unaffected by any of the healing treatments tested in this experiment, or by crop type. Tomato and pepper had 14% greater survival rates on average than eggplant at all measurement dates, while tomato tended to have greater plant growth, followed by eggplant and pepper.

However, theory is unclear as to whether dispersal will provide spatial insurance when environmental conditions are changing directionally. In particular, increased temperatures as a result of climate change are expected to cause synchronous growth or decline across species and communities, and this has the potential to erode the stabilizing compensatory dynamics facilitated by dispersal. Here we report on an experimental test of how dispersal affects the diversity and stability of metacommunities under warming using replicate two-patch pond zooplankton metacommunities. Initial differences in local community composition and abiotic conditions were established by seeding each patch in the metacommunities with plankton and sediment from one of two natural ponds that differed in water chemistry and species composition. We exposed metacommunities to a 2 degrees C increase in average ambient temperature, crossed with three rates of dispersal (none, intermediate, high). In ambient conditions, intermediate dispersal rates preserved diversity and stabilized metacommunities by promoting spatially asynchronous fluctuations in biomass, especially between local populations of the dominant genus, Ceriodaphnia. However, warming synchronized their populations so that these effects of dispersal were lost. Furthermore, because the stabilizing effect of dispersal was primarily due to asynchronous fluctuations between populations of a single genus, metacommunity biomass was stabilized, but dispersal did not stabilize local community biomass. Our results show that dispersal can preserve diversity and provide stability to metacommunities, but also show that this benefit can be eroded when warming is directional and synchronous across patches of a metacommunity, as is expected with climate warming.",,,,,"Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020; Gonzalez, Andrew/F-2247-2010; Thompson, Patrick L/B-6213-2012","Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Gonzalez, Andrew/0000-0001-6075-8081; Thompson, Patrick L/0000-0002-5278-9045",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,SEP,2015,124,9,,,,,1171,1180,,10.1111/oik.01945,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.01945,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000360823400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

These mutant forms have altered antiviral and antiproliferative activities, and receptor-binding affinities, and their ability to extend estrous cycle length after being injected i.m. into nonpregnant ewes has been established. In experiment 1, i.m. injection of either PBS (vehicle) alone or with 0.1 mg (n = 4), 0.5 mg (n = 4), or 2.0 mg (n = 3) of recombinant oIFN-tau (S4, identified below) was performed twice daily on Days 11-18 postestrus (Day 0 = estrus).

In subsequent experiments, the dosage of oIFN-tau was 1.0 mg per injection twice daily. The objective of experiment 2 was to determine the effect of mutated forms of oIFN-tau on luteal life span in sheep. Fifty-seven ewes received twice-daily injections (i.m.) from Day 10 to Day 20 postestrus of PBS (vehicle) either atone (n = 9), with 0.3 mg/injection of bacterial contaminating proteins (BP; n = 10), or with 1 mg/injection of one of the following forms of recombinant oIFN-tau: 1) a fully active, 172-amino acid (aa) oIFN-tau (S4, n = 10); 2) a form lacking 11 aa at the carboxyl terminus and with an I-143-->T mutation (S1), which had very low antiviral and antiproliferative activities and receptor-binding affinities (n = 9); 3) a truncated form identical to S1 but with I-143 restored (TRN11), which had low antiviral and antiproliferative activities but only slightly reduced receptor-binding affinities (n = 10); and 4) a form similar to wild type S4 (S4-K) with low antiviral and antiproliferative activities but only slightly reduced receptor-binding affinities (n = 9).

For the crushed rock highway embankment embedded a perforated ventilation pipe in permafrost regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the mechanism of impact on the cooling capability enhanced by a perforated ventilation pipe in the air-tight crushed rock layer was studied using laboratory experiment. All boundary conditions at each edge of the crushed rock sample with dimensions of 100 x 60 x 100 cm except the inlet and outlet of the perforated pipe are air-tight. A ventilation steel pipe with an inner diameter of 8 cm was drilled with many small holes with a diameter of 1 cm and horizontally embedded in the length direction of the crushed rock sample with a depth of 53 cm. The laboratory experiments with a periodically fluctuating air temperature in the inner test tank regulated by program control were performed. The perforated pipe is only ventilated during the negative temperature fluctuation period in the inner test tank. The results show that the heat transfer processes in the crushed rock layer embedded a perforated ventilation pipe with an air-tight surface include pure heat conduction, forced convection that occurs in the crushed rock layer forming directly a pore air circulation in conjunction with the in-duct air by the small holes of perforated pipe wall absorbed from the inner test tank, and convective heat transport between the in-duct air and the inner surface of ventilation pipe wall. When air temperatures in the inner test tank are colder than the pore air temperatures in the crushed rock region around the perforated ventilation pipe, the perforated ventilation pipe can produce a significantly enhanced cooling of the crushed rock layer base due to the direct formation of a complete pore air circulation in the crushed rock layer in conjunction with the in-duct air via the small holes of the perforated pipe wall. When the fluctuating air temperature in the inner test tank rises from a minimum value to a warmer one than the pore air temperature in the crushed rock region around the perforated pipe during the negative temperature ventilating period, a warming process begins to occur in the crushed rock layer due to a warmer in-duct air absorbed from the inner test tank. This stronger warming process in the crushed rock region around the perforated pipe may decrease the cooling capability of the air-tight crushed rock layer. Thus, in order to avoid this warming process at this stage before ventilating end, the ventilating end time of ventilation pipe ought to be brought forward. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

While the supply of Atlantic cod to European markets is relatively stable, this species continues to represent an interesting, and potentially lucrative, opportunity for commercial-scale aquaculture. Due to fishing restrictions and quota decreases over the last decade, the supply of Spanish-caught cod in European markets has declined, while the local demand for this species has increased. As wild-capture will not grow to meet this increased demand, land-based aquaculture of cod could represent a viable production model to satisfy demand. However, both capital investments and operation costs for a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) farm are expected to be high, and therefore, all economic aspects must be taken into account before embarking on design or planning considerations. The influence of thermal control on growth, mortality and product quality also represent an important landmark when considering land-based aquaculture operations. The following represents a feasibility study to analyze the different economic scenarios and biological factors that can influence the business potential of growing this species in RAS. 2500 cod individuals were reared at two different thermal regimes (i.e., controlled and natural range, respectively) through 2 pilot RAS set up in the Basque region (Northern Spain). The experiment lasted 430 days. Statistical differences were found in survival between different thermal regimes but no significant differences were detected within the fall or winter seasons. Daily specific growth rates were significantly different during the summer season with some compensatory growth patterns being observed in the natural thermal regime set up. Likewise, statistical significances were found between the fat contents from both temperatures after the summer period. Conversely, no significant differences were observed at sensorial level between the samples obtained within our pilot experiment and commercial samples from wild origin. Electricity use was found to be one of the most significant economic costs to be considered. The present study represents the first technical feasibility attempt on cod in land-based aquaculture from the north of Spain and demonstrates the technical feasibility to produce on-land based cod in the region, the equivalence of growth patterns with previous studies, the usefulness of the proposed thermal regime management as a tool for this species production, and the key economic parameters and thresholds for a potential feasible commercial activity in the region.

For this purpose, two 'Housui' and 'Kousui' cultivars, which had different performance under insufficient chilling accumulation, were used. For the determination of the dormancy overcoming, two classic models were used: amount of chilling hours (CH) below 7.2 degrees C during endodormancy phase and the growth degree hours (GDH) during heating accumulation on ecodormancy phase; another model, called developmental stage index (DVI), was used for both phases of dormancy. The flower bud abortion was observed in all treatments, and its incidence was higher in 'Housui' than in 'Kousui'. With delaying chilling treatment, the occurrence of the phenomenon increased. Compared to the first year of experiment (2005-06), the second year (2006-07) had higher average temperatures during period of chilling accumulation in all treatments, and this was reflected on DVI progression and duration in both stages of dormancy: the time necessary to accumulate 600CH and GDH necessary for flowering increased in all treatments during the second year of the experiment. These results suggested that the temperature range at the initial phase of dormancy affects on flower bud abortion occurrence, chilling requirement and duration of dormancy more in 'Housui' than in 'Kousui'.",,,,,,"Sugaya, Sumiko/0000-0003-1318-2627",,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,978-90-6605-533-9,,,,2010,872,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000323816000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Aims To increase animal protein sources, promote their availability to rural people, and reduce the unit cost of protein to the people, the effect of dietary crude protein on feed consumption, egg productivity and egg-quality characteristics of quail in the high-altitude Ekiti area of Nigeria was evaluated. Methods In total, 142 mature Japanese quails, divided into four groups with four replicates per group, were fed with four diets differing in dietary protein concentration with a near-isocaloric maize-groundnut cake-soybean meal-based diets for 10 weeks. Three experimental diets (18%, 22% and 24% crude protein (CP)) were tested and compared with a control 20% CP diet, in a completely randomised design of four replicates per treatment. Each consisted of 10 quails/cage at 5 weeks of age. Parameters measured on each quail included feed intake, egg number and egg-quality characteristics. Data were subjected to general linear model, regression and Duncan multiple-range procedures for means separation by SAS(R)v9.4 (2013). Key results Increasing dietary protein from 18% to 24% in the diet of experimental quails decreased daily feed intake, hen-day egg production (HDP) and average egg mass (AEM; P < 0.05) during egg lay, whereas egg weight and diameter, egg shell weight, albumen weight, height and percentage, and yolk height increased significantly (P < 0.05). The 18% CP diet produced the highest HDP and AEM responses (P < 0.05). The 20% CP diet produced the highest numerical shell and yolk percentages (P > 0.05). Birds on 22% CP diet consumed the lowest quantity of feed (daily feed intake, P < 0.05) and had the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR, P > 0.05). Birds on 24% CP diet produced the highest egg weight and diameter, egg shell weight, albumen weight, height and percentage, and yolk height (P < 0.05). Haugh unit values were high and uninfluenced by an increasing dietary protein concentration (P > 0.05). The high and above-threshold environmental temperature-humidity index value of the test station resulted in heat stress during egg production, and was considered major cause of the generally low productivity and low egg-trait values obtained. Conclusions The 18% CP diet produced the highest HDP and AEM, while the 22% CP diet was the most efficiently utilised diet, and 24% CP diet stimulated higher egg-weight and egg-quality traits.

In both studies, combined marketable fruit yields of first quality and second quality (minor cracking patterns and yellow spots) increased linearly with decreasing SRI (increased events per day).

Standing crop of sporangia was assessed each morning at 07<bold>00</bold>h EDT and ranged from 320 to 16170 sporangiam(-2). Disease severity and height above the canopy significantly (P<0<bold>0001</bold>) affected C with mean concentration (C-m) being high at moderate disease. Values of C-m decreased rapidly with canopy height and at a height of 2<bold>0</bold>m, C-m was only 7% of values measured at 0<bold>5</bold>m when disease was moderate. Daily total flux (F-D) was dependent on disease severity and ranged from 5<bold>9</bold> to 2242<bold>3</bold> sporangiam(-2).

Variations of C-m and F-D with increasing disease were well described (P<0<bold>0001</bold>) by a log-normal model with 15% as the threshold above which C-m and F-D decreased as disease severity increased.

Three experiments were conducted using Ross 308 male chicks fed diets based on corn, soybean meal, and additional graded crystalline AA with 228 g/kg of crude protein. Each diet contained the same amount of basal diets including corn, soybean meal, corn starch, and soybean oil, and graded AA were substituted at the expense of L-glutamic acid in order to keep all diets isonitrogenous. A total of 720 birds were allocated to 6 treatment groups, with 15 birds per cage and 8 cages per treatment using a randomized complete block design. Body weight and group feed intake were measured on day 10. The dietary SID AA levels in each experiment ranged from 2.9 to 6.9 g of methionine/kg, with increments of 0.8 g/kg (Exp. 1), 4.5-8.5 g of threonine/kg, with increments of 0.8 g/kg (Exp. 2), and 1.1-2.1 g of tryptophan/kg, with increments of 0.2 g/kg (Exp. 3), respectively. The methionine requirement was conducted in the presence of 4.5 g total cysteine/kg diet which was 4.3 g/kg diet in SID cysteine. Average daily gain and gain to feed ratio showed linear and quadratic relations to increasing levels of SID methionine, threonine, and tryptophan, respectively (P < 0.01). The SID requirements for broiler chicks at the age of 1-10 days were determined using 12.4 g/kg of SID lysine concentrations in the dietary treatments. The requirement for average daily gain and gain to feed ratios were 3.85 and 3.84 g/kg for SID methionine when the diet contained 4.3 g SID cysteine/kg diet (thus, total sulfur AA requirements were 8.15 and 8.14 g/kg, respectively), 7.11 and 7.38 g/kg for SID threonine, and 1.58 and 1.36 g/kg for SID tryptophan, respectively.

These limitations are expected to become increasingly important in several coffee growing areas and are the main factors responsible for the fluctuations in coffee yield. Because of population pressure for arable lands in most of coffee growing areas in Ethiopia, coffee cultivation has spread towards marginal areas where water shortage and high temperature constitute significant reduction in coffee yield. Also, in most cases, there is shortage of water resources for irrigation during prolonged dry spells which affect the growth and the development of plants under different forms during the phonological phases of the coffee crop. Such environmental factors include reduced rainfall and high temperatures both of which majorly contribute to drought. Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica, L.) is a shade adapted plant in the natural multi-strata forest ecosystems with the occurrence of wild Arabica coffee populations in Ethiopia. However, these are fragmented forests and their coverage is shrinking from time to time, largely due to anthropogenic activities. As a result, coffee is either replaced by other crops or its cultivation is expanding into less suitable open-sun conditions. These coupled with the increasing patterns of climate change are threatening coffee production of the country, as well as the natural gene pools of Arabic coffee. Coffee genetic resources are believed to possess desirable traits, including high yielding, superior quality, resistance to diseases, tolerant to moisture stress and other important agronomic traits. Nonetheless, the underlying adaptation strategies that take into account genetic and environmental factors remain little understood to fully exploit the wealth of coffee and ecological diversity in Ethiopia. Because released Arabica coffee varieties and landraces in Ethiopia can be broadly classified into three canopy classes of open, medium and compact crown types and their water relations can vary accordingly. To this end, information on eco-physiological traits (genetically fixed traits) of coffee towards identifying drought tolerant Arabica coffee cultivars for specific geographical areas is very crucial and would also help in predicting the future field performances of coffee genotypes under varying environmental conditions. Agronomic measures against drought control, such as shading, irrigation, high density planting and use of resistant genotypes that are adapted to climatic fluctuations are also the alternative solutions against drought tolerance in coffee cultivation. In this review we highlighted some aspects of drought stresses on coffee growth and development in addition to focusing our attention on eco-physiology of production in Arabica coffee under Ethiopian coffee growing situations. The review is organized into sections dealing with: (i) coffee plant traits involved in drought tolerance, (ii) physiological approaches to determine drought tolerance (iii) findings in drought adaptation of Arabica coffee in Ethiopia, (iv) photosynthesis and crop yield, (v) Insitu Eco-physiological response to natural drought, (vi) agronomic methods for controlling drought stress and, (vii) impact and responses of coffee plant to drought stress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2197-0025,,,,,DEC,2014,26,3-4,,,,,225,239,,10.1007/s40626-014-0022-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40626-014-0022-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000347088700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Brazil, A. grandis has a limited distribution; it is absent from northern and northeastern Brazil and distributed discontinuously in other parts of the country. To indirectly evaluate the influence of climatic and edaphic variables on the occurrence of A. grandis, we used data based on 4 years of cucurbit fruit collections from all mesoregions of the state of Sao Paulo. Our results show evidence that A. grandis is constrained by a minimum air temperature above 12 degrees C, low (<20 degrees C) and high (>29 degrees C) maximum air temperature, and by low rainfall and relative humidity, occurring at altitudes from 520 to 780 m. More importantly, A. grandis was not collected in central to western Sao Paulo, where sandy soil and low soil water availability predominate and the climate is hot and dry. Our findings suggest that soil texture and moisture may be limiting factors for pupal survivorship of A. grandis, and consequently edaphic characteristics should be taken into account in studies on its geographical distribution. Based on our results, central to western Sao Paulo state can potentially be classified as an area of low pest prevalence.

In order to investigate the phenomenon of the gravitational erosion process of vegetation slopes under freeze-thaw in seasonally frozen soil regions, on-site freeze-thaw tests of different vegetation slopes were conducted in the frozen soil testing ground of Kitami Institute of Technology (KIT, Hokkaido, Japan). Slope vegetation is divided into an external-soil spray seeding section and a turfed section according to its method of formation. Through field tests of four cycles, the slope temperature, frost depth, amount of frost-heave, and amount of movement were observed dynamically in real-time, initially revealing the regularity of the gravitational erosion process of the vegetation slope, which provided a scientific basis for slope stability control in cold regions. The experimental results show that the gravitational erosion of the slope is a process of irreversible gradual evolution, that the extent of erosion has a periodical fluctuation in time, that the target point of the slope surface moves in a jagged trajectory down the slope year after year, and that the maximum values of the amount of movement of the external-soil spray seeding section and the turfed section are -13.1 and -6.1 cm, respectively, after four freeze-thaw cycles. The space distribution of the slope surface has inhomogeneity. The difference in temperature and water content of each part of the slope surface is the main reason why the freezing front of the slope is not parallel to the slope surface. The amount of frost-heave of the slope toe was greater than that of the slope crest, which caused upward displacement along the slope during early freezing. The movement of the slope is closely related to the development of vegetation, and the heat insulation and reinforcement of vegetation cover effectively restrain the displacement of the slope's shallow soil. The results of this study have a certain significance in the prevention and treatment of shallow slope sliding in cold regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0165-232X,1872-7441,,,,JUL,2018,151,,,,,,168,178,,10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.03.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.03.020,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000432682200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

We calculated a centre of gravity index and a dispersion index using only individuals recaptured more than 1 year after tagging during the summer. The centre of gravity showed a northward expansion and eastward contraction in recent years, reflecting both fish distribution and changes in fishing effort.

Highly susceptible species are the first to decline and/or disappear once Bd arrives at a site. These competent hosts likely facilitate Bd proliferation because of ineffective innate and/or acquired immune defenses. We show that Atelopus zeteki, a highly susceptible species that has undergone substantial population declines throughout its range, rapidly and exponentially increases skin Bd infection intensity, achieving intensities that are several orders of magnitude greater than most other species reported. We experimentally infected individuals that were never exposed to Bd (n = 5) or previously exposed to an attenuated Bd strain (JEL427-P39; n = 3). Within seven days post-inoculation, the average Bd infection intensity was 18,213 zoospores (SE: 9,010; range: 0 to 66,928). Both average Bd infection intensity and zoospore output (i.e., the number of zoospores released per minute by an infected individual) increased exponentially until time of death (t(50) = 7.018, p, 0.001, t(46) = 3.164, p = 0.001, respectively). Mean Bd infection intensity and zoospore output at death were 4,334,422 zoospores (SE: 1,236,431) and 23.55 zoospores per minute (SE: 22.78), respectively, with as many as 9,584,158 zoospores on a single individual. The daily percent increases in Bd infection intensity and zoospore output were 35.4% (SE: 0.05) and 13.1% (SE: 0.04), respectively. We also found that Bd infection intensity and zoospore output were positively correlated (t(43) = 3.926, p<0.001). All animals died between 22 and 33 days post-inoculation (mean: 28.88; SE: 1.58). Prior Bd infection had no effect on survival, Bd infection intensity, or zoospore output. We conclude that A. zeteki, a highly susceptible amphibian species, may be an acute supershedder.

A series of migratory anticyclone passages under a strong El Nino event meant that the experimental period was much warmer and drier than the climatological ones. The mean air temperature during this period was 2.6 degrees C higher than the recent 30-year (1981-2010) climatological value, while only one-eighth of the climatological precipitation was recorded. Twelve mist event days were recorded, as were four of haze and six of rainfall events. The SMA was found to be affected by the sea-land breeze: Westerly winds (sea-breezes) were dominant from the afternoon till the early evening, while easterlies (land-breezes) were dominant before the morning. Finally, the vertical profile of the attenuated backscatter obtained by the ceilometer indicated that the maximum daily mixing-layer heights (MLHs) on days with mist/haze and much cloud cover were lower than on days with no-mist/haze and less cloud cover, respectively, mainly due to a decrease in the downward solar radiation. However, the effect of mist/haze on the daytime MLH evolution was larger than that of cloud cover.

This Bushland Evapotranspiration and Agricultural Remote sensing EXperiment 2008 (BEAREX08) involved determination of micrometeorological fluxes (surface energy balance) in four weighing lysimeter fields (each 4.7 ha) containing irrigated and dryland cotton and in nearby bare soil, wheat stubble and rangeland fields using nine eddy covariance stations, three large aperture scintillometers, and three Bowen ratio systems. In coordination with satellite overpasses, flux and remote sensing aircraft flew transects over the surrounding fields and region encompassing an area contributing fluxes from 10 to 30 km upwind of the USDA-ARS lysimeter site. Tethered balloon soundings were conducted over the irrigated fields to investigate the effect of advection on local boundary layer development. Local ET was measured using four large weighing lysimeters, while field scale estimates were made by soil water balance with a network of neutron probe profile water sites and from the stationary flux systems. Aircraft and satellite imagery were obtained at different spatial and temporal resolutions. Plot-scale experiments dealt with row orientation and crop height effects on spatial and temporal patterns of soil surface temperature, soil water content, soil heat flux, evaporation from soil in the interrow, plant transpiration and canopy and soil radiation fluxes. The BEAREX08 field experiment was unique in its assessment of ET fluxes over a broad range in spatial scales; comparing direct and indirect methods at local scales with remote sensing based methods and models using aircraft and satellite imagery at local to regional scales, and comparing mass balance-based ET ground truth with eddy covariance and remote sensing-based methods.

Theory predicts that environmental heterogeneity favors plasticity of adaptive traits. Here we investigated the performance in several traits of three sympatric Drosophila species freshly collected in two environments that differ in the heterogeneity of environmental conditions. Differences in trait means within species were found in several traits, indicating that populations differed in their evolutionary response to the environmental conditions of their origin. Different species showed distinct adaptation with a very different role of plasticity across species for coping with environmental changes. However, geographically distinct populations of the same species generally displayed the same levels of plasticity as induced by fluctuating thermal regimes. This indicates a weak and trait-specific effect of environmental heterogeneity on plasticity. Furthermore, similar levels of plasticity were found in a laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster with a common geographic origin but adapted to the laboratory conditions for more than 100 generations.

It was assumed that light and temperature are the most important factors controlling C. nodosa development, and that the growth was not limited by nutrient availability. The aim was to simulate biomass production as a function of external forcing variables (light, water temperature) and internal control (plant density). A series of simulation experiments were performed with the basic model showing that among the most important phenomena affecting C. nodosa growth are: (1) inhibition of production and recruitment of new shoots by high temperature and (2) light attenuation due to seasonal fluctuation.

From a dendrochronology perspective, tree populations growing in climatically marginal environments are expected to be more sensitive to seasonal and annual climate than those growing in optimal climate zones. From a genetics perspective, marginal populations may be adapted to grow a small amount each year and then shut down to prevent climate-induced mortality, or they may be adapted to respond to favourable climate conditions when available. We examined the relative strength of these forces using data from 12 populations of 34-year-old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees growing in 16 provenance-trial sites in western Canada. Growth generally correlated positively with annual temperature and negatively with summer aridity. The sensitivity of radial-growth to interannual climate fluctuations was both site and provenance-related, with the highest sensitivities occurring among populations from warm, central provenances growing at cold, marginal sites, and among populations from cold, marginal provenances growing at warm, central sites. The correlations between climate and growth varied regionally; notably, populations from warm provenances growing at warm sites responded more strongly to summer aridity, while populations from cold provenances growing at warm sites responded more to annual temperature. Our finding that sensitivity varied among populations growing under similar climate conditions indicates that sensitivity is influenced by genetics as well as by site climate, but the regional specificity of the growth responses did not support a single hypothesis for the influence of genetics on growth among populations from marginal vs. central locations. Implications of our study for forest productivity under climate change are more positive for trees growing in cool locations, where overall warmer temperatures will lead to increased growth, than in warm locations, where the negative effects of arid summers may counteract the positive effects of warmer annual temperatures.

To determine the appropriate experimental salinity range we exposed nauplii and adults to abrupt salinity changes from 35 g/L to 5, 10, 15, 35, 42, and 48 g/L at 30 degrees C and determined survival after 24 hours. The second experiment stocked early stage nauplii into 1 L beakers after which they were cultured using standard procedures for 10 days at six salinities (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 g/L): from this survival, sex ratio, time to maturation, and fecundity were measured. The third experiment evaluated the effects of salinity on brood size, brood interval, and nauplii production by stocking individual adult pairs and monitoring nauplii production daily for 10 days. The fourth experiment determined the effects of salinity on population growth and composition of the population produced by stocking 10 adult pairs and culturing them until five days after the first mature adults were observed. Results from the abrupt salinity change experiment showed nauplii survival decreased following abrupt changes in salinity from 35 g/L to <15 g/L and >35 g/L Additionally, adults do not tolerate rapid changes in salinity from 35 g/L to <15 g/L but are rather tolerant of changes in salinity up to 48 g/L. Survival from early nauplii to adult was not significantly affected by salinity but survival declined at 35 g/L Time to first maturation and maturation of the entire population was significantly influenced by salinity and took from 6.3 to 9.5 days. In the individual paired adults experiment, salinity significantly affected nauplii production by affecting brood interval and brood size. The percentage of ovigerous females peaked at 20 g/L and declined at salinities above and below this value. When developing production objectives, aquaculturists must consider salinity because of its numerous effects on the culture of P. pelagicus.

For a period of 3 mo, we placed four groups of snakes under four contrasted thermal treatments: (1) a natural regime (NR), based on daily variations (24-h cycle); (2) an accelerated regime (AR), where the thermoperiod fluctuated rapidly (12-h cycle); (3) a slow regime (SR; 48-h cycle); and (4) a cool stable regime (ZR; no fluctuation). The mean temperature, set at 23 degrees C, was identical for the four groups. For the first three groups (NR, AR, SR), ambient temperature fluctuated between 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Relative humidity and photoperiod were constant. We recorded feeding success, digestion efficiency, growth rate, activity, and ecdysis events. Differences between groups were expected because of varied exposure to the optimal temperatures, most notably in the ZR group, where the preferred body temperature for digestion (similar to 30 degrees C) would not be reached. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of the experimental treatment on feeding rate, digestion, body mass increase, and growth rate. Our results do not conform to the paradigm stipulating that maximal body temperature selected by ectotherms necessarily corresponds to the most efficient for resource assimilation and that temperature fluctuations are essential. We propose that increasing the digestive tract's performance through body-temperature elevation trades off against elevated (parasite) energy expenditure from the rest of the body. The main advantage of high body temperatures would be to reduce the amount of time necessary to assimilate prey rather than to improve the net mass gain during digestion.",,,,,,"Bonnet, Xavier/0000-0001-6150-8199",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,,,,,NOV,2010,83,6,,,,,924,931,,10.1086/656050,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/656050,,,,,,,,20969448,,,,,WOS:000283992100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This investigation aimed to determine whether genetic recombination of different strains is required for resting cyst formation and whether newly formed cysts are dormant. Field data (temperature and salinity) and sediment surface samples were collected from a site with recurrent blooms and germination and encystment experiments were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. Results indicate a lack of seasonal germination pattern, set by an endogenous rhythm, as commonly found with other dinoflagellates from the Baltic Sea. Germination of quiescent cysts was triggered by temperatures exceeding 10 degrees C and combined nutrient limitation of nitrogen and phosphorus or a drop in temperature from 16 to 10 degrees C triggered encystment most efficiently. Genetic recombination was not mandatory for the formation of resting cysts, but supported higher numbers of resistant cysts and enhanced germination capacity after a resting period. Findings from this study confirm that A. ostenfeldii follows a generalist germination and cyst formation strategy, driven by strong seasonality, which may support its persistence and possibly expansion in marginal environments in the future, if higher temperatures facilitate a longer growth season.",,,,,,"Suikkanen, Sanna/0000-0002-0768-8149; Kremp, Anke/0000-0001-9484-6899; Ahonen, Salla/0000-0002-0213-8332; Jerney, Jacqueline/0000-0002-2736-5179",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3646,1529-8817,,,,DEC,2019,55,6,,,,,1226,1238,,10.1111/jpy.12919,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.12919,,OCT 2019,,,,,,31520419,,,,,WOS:000489549700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increased climatic variability is expected to have different effects on species and ecosystems than gradual warming. A key challenge to predict the impact of climate change is to understand how temperature changes will affect species interactions. Herbivorous insects and their natural enemies belong to some of the largest groups of terrestrial animals, and thus they have a great impact on the functioning of ecosystems and on the services these ecosystems provide. Here we studied the life history traits of the plant-feeding insect Plutella xylostella and its specialist endoparasitoid Diadegma semiclausum, when exposed to a daily heat pulse of 5 or 10 degrees C temperature increase during their entire immature phase. Growth and developmental responses differed with the amplitude of the heat pulse and they were different between host and parasitoid, indicating different thermal sensitivity of the two trophic levels. With a + 5 degrees C heat pulse, the adult parasitoids were larger which may result in a higher fitness, whereas a + 10 degrees C heat pulse retarded parasitoid development. These results show that the parasitoid is more sensitive than its host to brief intervals of temperature change, and this results in either positive or negative effects on life history traits, depending on the amplitude of the heat pulse.

This microorganism is especially important because it can grow at storage temperatures recommended for milk (less than or equal to 7 degrees C).

The resulting variation in body composition leads to variation in energy requirements for protein turn-over and thermoregulation, causing between-animal variation in maintenance requirements (MEmaint) Simulated population means for P-infinity r L-infinity/P-infinity and B-star were varied in three steps each. Excluding unrealistic parameter combinations this led to 3(3) - 6 = 21 simulated genotypes. Simulated within-population coefficients of variation (CV) were 7, 15 and 3%. Random replicates of each genotype were simulated five times, in climatic conditions that were in turn severely cold, mildly cold (about 5 and 1 degrees C below lower critical temperature), thermoneutral, mildly hot and severely hot (about 1 and 5 degrees C above upper critical temperature), during the entire growth period of 23 to 200 kg live weight. Simulated food intake was ad libitum. Simulated thermoneutral within-population standard deviations of body protein and lipid content were 0.21 to 0.46 kg and 0.78 to 2.14 kg at 100 kg body weight. On average, the corresponding values in cold and hot conditions were slightly higher. MEmaint showed a protein-turn-over-related within-population CV of 1.5% at thermoneutrality. Thermoregulatory action contributed about 4% extra variance in cold and hot conditions but CV values were not affected. A genetic increase in the maximum protein deposition rate from 100 to 250 g/day would increase MEmaint as related to protein turn-over and thermoregulation by 11% at thermoneutrality, and by 6 to 11% in cold or hot conditions. Two relevant groups of genotypes could be distinguished based on the within-population regression coefficients of MEmaint on daily or cumulative protein deposition (b(dailyPdep), b(cumPdep)). These ranged from 0.250 to 0.428 kJ/kg(0.75) per day per g/day and from 2.77 to 5.45 kJ/kg(0.75) per day per kg, respectively, in 12 'conventional' genotypes at thermoneutrality. On average, b(dailyPdep) was increased by 48%, 20%, -11% and -36% in the other climatic conditions mentioned above, respectively. The corresponding increase of b(cumPdep) was 32%, 14%, 8% and 48%. Three fast-growing lean genotypes showed similar b(dailyPdep) and b(cumPdep) at thermoneutrality, but much more pronounced increases in cold and hot conditions: 137%, 49%, -12% and + 88% for b(dailyPdep) and 248%, 108%, 17% and 196% for b(cumPdep). It is concluded that differences in body composition traits between pig genotypes do not cause important between-genotype differences in thermoregulatory MEmaint, and that thermoregulatory processes contribute little body-composition-related variation to hot or cold MEmaint within most genotypes. The inferences to be made from this with regard to experimental design are discussed. The verification of the above predictions will require a very elaborate and large-scale experiment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1357-7298,,,,,AUG,2000,71,,1,,,,11,30,,10.1017/S1357729800054850,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1357729800054850,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088673100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Diel and short-term fluctuations in such sexual signals pose a puzzle for condition capture models of mate choice, which assume a female preference for male traits that reliably reflect a male's quality. Here we experimentally manipulated the food supply of individual male field crickets Gryllus campestris in their natural habitat in two consecutive seasons to determine (i) the effect of male nutritional condition on the fine-scaled variation of diel investment in acoustic signalling and (ii) the temporal association between the diel variation in male signalling and female mate-searching behaviour. Overall food-supplemented males signalled more often, but the effect was only visible during the daytime. In the evening and the night, signal output was still high but the time spent signalling was unrelated to a male's nutritional condition. Females' mate-searching behaviour also showed a diel rhythm with peak activity during the afternoon, when differences among calling males were highest, and where signal output reliably reflects male quality. These findings suggest that males differing in nutritional condition may optimize their investment in signalling in relation to time of day as to maximize mating success.",,,,,"Otti, Oliver/AAH-2963-2021","Otti, Oliver/0000-0002-2361-9661; Brinkhof, Martin/0000-0002-9319-665X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,MAR 7,2008,275,1634,,,,,579,585,,10.1098/rspb.2007.1500,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2007.1500,,,,,,,,18089535,,,,,WOS:000252764800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examined photosynthetic and respiratory responses of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) from two portions of the species' range for evidence of both phenomena in a laboratory study with seedlings. A field study was also conducted to assess the impacts of temperature acclimation on saplings subjected to an imposed temperature manipulation (4 degrees C above ambient temperature). The two seedling populations exhibited more evidence of physiological acclimation to warming than of ecotypic adaptation, although respiration was less sensitive to short-term warming in the southern population than in the northern population. In both seedling populations, thermal compensation increased photosynthesis by 14% and decreased respiration by 10% in the warm-acclimated groups. Saplings growing in open-top field chambers at ambient temperature and 4 degrees C above ambient temperature showed evidence of temperature acclimation, but photosynthesis did not increase in response to the 4 degrees C warming. On the contrary, photosynthetic rates measured at the prevailing chamber temperature throughout three growing seasons were similar, or lower (12% lower on average) in saplings maintained at 4 degrees C above ambient temperature compared with saplings maintained at ambient temperature. However, the long-term photosynthetic temperature optimum for saplings in the field experiment was higher than it was for seedlings in either the 27 or the 31 degrees C growth chamber. Respiratory acclimation was also evident in the saplings in the field chambers. Saplings had similar rates of respiration in both temperature treatments, and respiration showed little dependence on prevailing temperature during the growing season. We conclude that photosynthesis and respiration in sugar maple have the potential for physiological acclimation to temperature, but exhibit a low degree of genetic adaptation. Some of the potential for acclimation to a 4 degrees C increase above a background of naturally fluctuating temperatures may be offset by differences in water relations, and, in the long term, may be obscured by the inherent variability in rates under field conditions. Nevertheless, physiologically based models should incorporate seasonal acclimation to temperature and permit ecotypic differences to influence model outcomes for those species with high genetic differentiation between regions.",,,,,"Norby, Richard J/C-1773-2012; Wullschleger, Stan D/B-8297-2012","Norby, Richard J/0000-0002-0238-9828; Wullschleger, Stan D/0000-0002-9869-0446",,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,JAN,2000,20,2,,,,,87,96,,,,,,,,,,,12651476,,,,,WOS:000085197100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The laboratory experiment included replicated species from Southern, Central, and Northern Europe. Although annual fluctuations in temperature represent a key characteristic of temperate environments, few studies of thermal performance have considered the ecological importance of the studied traits within a seasonal context. Instead, thermal performance is assumed to remain constant throughout ontogeny and to reflect selection acting over the whole life cycle. The laboratory experiment revealed considerable variation among species in the strength and direction of ontogenetic performance shifts. In four species from Southern and Central Europe, reaction norms were steepest during early ontogeny, becoming less steep during later ontogenetic stages (indicative of low-temperature acclimation). In one Northern European species, the slope of reaction norms did not change during ontogeny. In the other North European species, reaction norms became steeper during ontogeny (indicative of high-temperature acclimation). We had expected high-latitude species to show strong low-temperature acclimation responses, because they have a short flight season and inhabit a strongly seasonal environment. Instead, we found the reversed pattern: Low-latitude species displayed strong low-temperature acclimation responses, and high-latitude species displayed weak, or even reversed, acclimation responses to low temperatures. These findings suggest that low-temperature acclimation may be less beneficial and possibly more costly in habitats with rapid seasonal transitions in average temperature. We conclude that thermal performance traits are more dynamic than typically assumed and caution against using results from single ontogenetic stages to predict species' responses to changing environmental conditions.",,,,,"Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020","Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,,,NOV,2013,83,4,,,,,491,510,,10.1890/12-1383.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/12-1383.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000330526800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although several methods are available for computing reference evapotranspiration (ETo), the provision of complete and accurate climate data is often a problem. Therefore, weighing lysimeter data from a semiarid highland environment were used to evaluate the performance of six commonly used reference evapotranspiration estimation methods with different data requirements (Penman-Monteith-FAO56, Priestley-Taylor, Radiation-FAO24, Hargreaves, Blaney-Criddle, Class A pan). The lysimeter experiments were conducted at Ankara Research Institute of Rural Services in Turkey, during the April-October cropping seasons of the years 2000-2002. The average ETo for the three seasons, computed from the lysimeter data, was 964 mm. The Penman-Monteith-FAO56 method was also evaluated for cases where relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, or all three parameters would be missing. This resulted in a total of 10 different methods. The RMS errors (RMSE) and index of agreement for the daily data and the monthly averages as well as the mean absolute error (MAE) for the seasonal totals were computed to compare these methods. The methods were ranked based on the sum of the ranks for all five evaluation criteria. The Penman-Montheith-FAO56 method with the full data set, with replacement of wind speed, and with replacement of relative humidity took the top three spots, with MAEs for the seasonal totals ranging between 40 and 70 mm. The Hargreaves method came in fourth (MAE 54 mm), followed by the Penman-Montheith-FAO56 method with replacement of all three parameters (MAE 57 mm). The RMSE for the monthly average ETo was 0.43 and 0.50 mm.days(-1) for the Penman-Monteith-FAO56 without and with replacement of all three parameters and 0.48 mm.days(-1) for Hargreaves. Thus, if only temperature data would be available, the much easier to use Hargreaves method would be preferred above the Penman-Montheith-FAO56 equation with replacement of humidity, radiation, and wind speed data, for this semiarid highland environment.",,,,,"Bruggeman, Adriana/J-6345-2013","Bruggeman, Adriana/0000-0002-6475-5221",,,,,,,,,,,,,0733-9437,1943-4774,,,,NOV,2010,136,11,,,,,757,765,,10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000249,http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000249,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000283200500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several pre-adult life history traits (development time, survival and competitive ability), adult life history related traits (wing size, wing shape and wing-aspect ratio), and wing size and shape asymmetries were measured at the three temperatures. Cold-adapted (13 degrees C) populations evolved longer development times and showed lower survival at the highest developmental temperature. No divergence for wing size was detected following adaptation to temperature extremes (13 and 22 degrees C), in agreement with earlier observations, but wing shape changes were obvious as a result of both thermal adaptation and development at different temperatures. However, the evolutionary trends observed for the wing-aspect ratio were inconsistent with an adaptive hypothesis. There was some indication that wing shape asymmetry has evolutionarily increased in warm-adapted populations, which suggests that there is additive genetic variation for fluctuating asymmetry and that it can evolve under rapid environmental changes caused by thermal stress. Overall, our results cast strong doubts on the hypothesis that body size itself is the target of selection, and suggest that pre-adult life history traits are more closely related to thermal adaptation.",,,,,"Santos, Mauro/A-8044-2008; Laayouni, Hafid/AAA-9254-2019","Santos, Mauro/0000-0002-6478-6570; Laayouni, Hafid/0000-0003-1297-5078",,,,,,,,,,,,,1010-061X,1420-9101,,,,NOV,2006,19,6,,,,,2006,2021,,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01139.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01139.x,,,,,,,,17040398,,,,,WOS:000241243100028,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the role that some relevant functional traits involved in resource uptake and/or stress tolerance could play on these inter-specific differences in phenological sensitivity remains largely unknown. In this study we evaluated experimentally how five co-occurring herbaceous species with contrasting functional strategies respond to current and ongoing climatic scenarios of increased temperature, decreased water availability and both abiotic changes acting interactively. To decompose the direct effect of climate change and the indirect effect of neighbors on plant performance and reproductive phenology, each of the five species was exposed to a density gradient of competitor species. Although the study species were more sensitive to changes in temperature than in water availability, the combined effect of both abiotic cues triggered very heterogeneous responses. Species with higher SLA values were particularly sensitive to climate change, delaying their reproduction and lengthening their flowering period under wanner scenarios while maintaining a high plant growth rate. In contrast, the species with the lowest SLA values exhibited less phenological variability to climate alterations, but they were more strongly affected by neighbor density compared to species with opposite trait values. These species-specific responses to climatic shifts altered the synchrony of phenological events at the community level. The most important changes appeared under the two scenarios of increased temperature, where 4 out of 5 species overlapped their flowering periods. Our findings indicate that the ongoing scenarios of increasing temperature and aridity could disrupt the phenological asynchrony within communities, and highlight the necessity of considering the interactive effects of temperature and precipitation to obtain an overall picture of climate change predictions on plant phenology and population dynamics.",,,,,"Godoy, Oscar/D-3976-2011; Matías, Luis/K-6761-2014; Matias, Luis/H-6184-2015; Cambrolle, Jesus/G-7133-2012","Godoy, Oscar/0000-0003-4988-6626; Matias, Luis/0000-0001-5603-5390; Cambrolle, Jesus/0000-0002-9750-6328",,,,,,,,,,,,,0098-8472,1873-7307,,,,FEB,2020,170,,,,SI,,,,103852,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.103852,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.103852,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000510958900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The instantaneous growth rates (g) from copepodid stage I (CI) to adult ranged from 0.08 to 0.10 d(-1). Daily per capita mortality rate of the cohorts was as low as 0.012 d(-1) (1.2% d(-1)). At local increasing temperatures (5.1 to 8.3 degrees C), development was equi-proportional, and the cumulative median development time from egg to CV was approximately 65 d. CV moulted to males and females, and egg production was initiated. Enhancement of food resources by nutrient addition caused a 23.4% increase in growth rates from CI to adult. Additionally, copepodid stages showed a generally larger body size, carbon and nitrogen content and total storage lipid content (wax esters + triacylglycerols) in response to enhanced resources. Our data support an elsewhere proposed exponential-growth hypothesis: growth of the structural compartments and store lipids (mostly wax esters) was exponential during the copepodid stages. However, a sigmoidal pattern of growth best described growth of adult stages if reared at high resources, and depot lipid accumulation in late CVs and adults at high resources. Body nitrogen growth in-creased exponentially, however, no significant changes in nitrogen specific growth rates were found between individuals from low and high resources. CV and adults: seem to have reached near-maximal weights at high resources, whereas structural weight continued to increase at low resources. Despite the differences in structural growth dynamics, cohort development was similar until the end of CV. During the onset of sexual differentiation, the male:female ratio and the adult CV ratio were highest at high food resources, suggesting that the time used for the final moult depends on the feeding history of the copepods in relation to food quality and quantity. It appears that relatively small changes in food availability strongly influence the biochemical composition of C. finmarchicus copepodids.",,,,,"Hansen, Benni W/K-3299-2015","Hansen, Benni W/0000-0003-1145-561X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,,,,,JUL,2000,136,6,,,,,1057,1073,,10.1007/s002270000292,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002270000292,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088452800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The validity of using laboratory leaf incubations to set light requirements was tested by comparison to in situ whole-plant measurements of photosynthesis versus irradiance (P vs I). Cosine (2 pi) and spherical (4 pi) sensors were used to measure photon flux density (PFD) in laboratory and field experiments, respectively. In addition, differences in PFDs recorded with the different sensors were examined by completing simultaneous in situ measurements. This data was used to compare estimates of production based on numerical integration and the daily light saturation period (H-sat). Laboratory-based seasonal photosynthetic performance was dependent on temperature and was site-specific. Rates of photosynthesis varied from ca 45 to 345 pmol O-2 g dry wt(-1) h(-1), while dark respiration values ranged from ca 5 to 105 pmol O-2 g dry wt(-1) h(-1). Late spring and summer saturation irradiance (I-k) values derived from laboratory incubations (I-k(2 pi) = 85 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)) were about 3-fold lower than in situ whole-plant measurements (I-k(4 pi) = 290 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)). Despite the large apparent differences in I-k(2 pi) and I-k(4 pi) values, integrated production calculated using the 2 estimations were similar because of lower in situ 2 pi cosine PFD values compared to the spherical 4 pi sensor (ca 50%). However, integrated production estimates using laboratory Pvs I data were still 12 to 22% lower than estimates based on whole-plant incubations. Application of the H-sat model to the data showed that the predictive capacity varied as a function of water transparency, source of P vs I data and sensor utilized; values were 14 to 100% lower than numerically integrated production. The results underscore the value of in situ PFD and entire-plant Pvs I measurements for seagrasses, especially under conditions of low water transparency characteristic of estuarine and near shore environments.",,,,,"Herzka, Sharon Z./E-1507-2015","Herzka, Sharon Z./0000-0001-7091-7656",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,,,,,,1997,152,1-3,,,,,103,117,,10.3354/meps152103,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps152103,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XK65100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Water-soluble potentially toxic elements concentration was determined at the end of the incubation period to confirm the reason of the toxicity differences found in the respirometric tests. All the sludge amended samples showed an increase of soil respiration compared to the unamended control, being positively related to the waste rate. A respiration inhibition appeared later (4 and 20 days in SN and SO soils, respectively, for the lower dose) and the time of delay depended on the waste rate used, being larger as waste dose increased. The toxicity level differed in the two soils essayed, mainly due to their basal microbial activity, and to their different properties, which determine the released elements bioavailability. Water-soluble elements determination at the end of the incubation revealed the presence of soluble Zn, Cr and Ba in different concentrations in the two soils.

We found that the low metabolism of this spider was not affected by water restriction, but its metabolism was depressed after 3 weeks of food deprivation. The spider did not show seasonal metabolic changes but it presented seasonal changes in the rate of evaporative water loss at high temperatures.

In this paper, meteorological station observations and results of the PRECIS (Providing REgional Climate for Impact Studies) RCM driven by the outputs of reanalysis ERA 40 data and HadAM3P general circulation model (GCM) results are used as input in the hydrological model. The objective is to investigate the effect of precipitation and temperature simulated with the PRECIS RCM nested in these two data sets on discharge simulated with the HBV model for three river basins in the Hindukush-Karakorum-Himalaya (HKH) region. Six HBV model experiments are designed: HBV-Met, HBV-ERA and HBV-Had, HBV-Met(CRU-corrected), HBV-ERA(Benchmark) and HBV-Had(Benchmark) where HBV is driven by meteorological stations data, data from PRECIS nested in ERA-40 and HadAM3P, meteorological stations CRU corrected data, ERA-40 reanalysis and HadAM3P GCM data, respectively. Present day PRECIS simulations possess strong capacity to simulate spatial patterns of present day climate characteristics. However, also some quantitative biases exist in the HKH region, where PRECIS RCM simulations underestimate temperature and overestimate precipitation with respect to CRU observations. The calibration and validation results of the HBV model experiments show that the performance of HBV-Met is better than the HBV models driven by other data sources. However, using input data series from sources different from the data used in the model calibration shows that HBV-Had is more efficient than other models and HBV-Met has the least absolute relative error with respect to all other models. The uncertainties are higher in least efficient models (i.e. HBV-Met(CRU-corrected) and HBV-ERA(Benchmark)) where the model parameters are also unrealistic. In terms of both robustness and uncertainty ranges the HBV models calibrated with PRECIS output performed better than other calibrated models except for HBV-Met which has shown a higher robustness. This suggests that in data sparse regions such as the HKH region data from regional climate models may be used as input in hydrological models for climate scenarios studies.",,,,,"Booij, Martijn J./C-7753-2011","Booij, Martijn J./0000-0001-6208-9045",,,,,,,,,,,,,1027-5606,1607-7938,,,,,2009,13,7,,,,,1075,1089,,10.5194/hess-13-1075-2009,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-13-1075-2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000268623600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of beta-carotene supplementation on bovine reproductive performance. This study was performed in Thailand, where the temperature-humidity index (THI) during the experimental periods was measured to range from 78.4 to 86.1. Lactating Holstein cows classified as repeat breeders (previous artificial insemination [AI] failures) were randomly assigned into two treatments, control treatment (T1; received placebo, n = 200) and test treatment (T2; received 400 mg/h/day of beta-carotene, n = 200). All cows were subjected to a protocol for synchronization of ovulation and timed artificial insemination (TAI). The day of the 1st ovulation synchronized protocol was defined as day 0, and the total experimental period was 160 days. Daily placebo or beta-carotene supplements were given orally on day 0 and each subsequent day of the experiment. Diagnosis of pregnancy was performed using ultrasound on day 30 after insemination. Non-pregnant cows were subjected to further ovulation synchronizations (maximum of four) and TAI over a period of 160 days. Milk samples were collected every ten days throughout the experiment. The samples were analyzed for beta-carotene concentration, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities. The pregnancies per AI of the cows in T2 were significantly greater than that of T1 from the 2nd to 4th TAI. During the entire experimental period, the pregnancies in T2 were significantly greater than that of T1. Cox's proportional hazards regression model data indicated a 44% greater probability of pregnancy for cows receiving beta-carotene. The concentrations of milk beta-carotene in T2 were significantly greater than T1 from the 2nd to 4th TAI. Significantly greater SOD and GPx activities were observed in T2 than T1, suggesting a reduction of oxidative stress in cows treated with beta-carotene.

Over a two year period, the rate of shoot extension of T. fluminensis in a New Zealand mixed mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus) coastal forest remnant showed a similar pattern to monthly mean values for mean daily air temperature and day length. Growth at the shoot apex was balanced by death at the shoot base. During the first year, nitrate (NO3-)content of the plant in the field was always > 250 mu mol g(-1) dry weight. On high NO3- supply in pot experiments, in a glasshouse or outdoors, total plant dry weight increased with increased relative irradiance from 1 to 30-50% (open ground photosynthetically active radiation = 100% relative irradiance). Changes in shoot to root dry weight ratio (S:R), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf chlorophyll, carotenoid and protein content associated with decreased irradiance from 50 to 1% were similar to those associated with increased distance into the forest remnant and are discussed in relation to shade acclimation. Values for S:R (>30.1) and SLA (approximate to 900 cm(2) g(-1) dry weight) were extremely high at low irradiance. These results support earlier conclusions that irradiance level is likely to be the primary factor limiting the extent of colonisation of forest remnants by T. fluminensis. Under glasshouse conditions, the growth response of T. fluminensis to different ammonium and NOS concentrations was similar to that previously reported for herbaceous species capable of rapid growth. Leaf nitrate reductase activity was within the range previously reported for fast growing species. Tradescantia fluminensis accumulated substantial amounts of NO3- in shoots with no depression in growth. This NO3- was utilised when nitrogen became limiting to growth.

A large maximum leaf area contributed to a high yield, a fast leaf senescence rate accelerated grain dehydration in the late growth period, and a compact root structure resulted in both of high-yield and fast-grain dehydration. A strong stem improved lodging resistance but maintained a high GM at harvest, and it is challenging to combine high GY and low GM in maize. High GY co-existed with low GM in some varieties that should have a rapid grain filling, a relatively long grain-filling duration, and a rapid grain dehydration in the late growth period. A high daily temperature in the late growth period also improved GY and reduced GM by influencing grain filling and dehydration, suggesting that adjusting the sowing date should be an alternative strategy to combine high GY and low GM in kernel harvesting.",,,,,"Wang, Yuan/GRF-3621-2022; Wang, Yu/GZL-9655-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2095-3119,,,,,JUL,2022,21,7,,,,,1941,1951,,10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63598-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-3119(20)63598-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000822695400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous experimental studies demonstrated that the invasibility of plant populations is reduced with increasing resident genetic diversity and is promoted by environmental fluctuations, but their combined effect has so far not been considered. In a growth chamber experiment, we tested whether the genotypic diversity of experimental populations of Arabidopsis thaliana (1, 3 or 6 genotypes) and temperature fluctuations affect population invasion by Senecio vulgaris, and how these factors interact. We found that genotypic diversity tended to increase the invasion resistance of experimental plant populations in terms of the biomass ratio between the species, and that temperature fluctuations strongly favoured Arabidopsis (biomass: +49%) over Senecio (-28%). However, there were no interactions between environmental fluctuations and genotypic diversity. Nevertheless, the magnitude of net diversity effects and transgressive overyielding depended on temperature conditions, indicating that increased environmental variability can influence diversity mechanisms.

Here, community respiration by epipelagic mesozooplankton in three seamounts of the Juan Fernandez Ridge, including the O'Higgins Seamount close to the coastal upwelling zone and two oceanic seamounts near the Juan Fernandez Archipelago (similar to 33 degrees S-78 degrees W), was assessed. Oxygen consumption by mixed assemblages was estimated using continuous measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration under controlled temperature during onboard, short-term incubations (2-4 h). Mesozooplankton composition was analyzed with a ZooScan device and expressed in terms of community normalized size spectra, and taxa and size diversity (Shannon-Wiener index). Carbon-specific community respiration rates in the upper 100 m layer were in the range of 0.3-1.9 mg O-2 m(-2) d(-1), indicating that up to 3.1% of the mesozooplankton biomass can be respired on a daily basis. The mesozooplankton community was dominated by small-size copepods but the proportions of small copepods, large copepods, and gelatinous zooplankton (mostly salps) changed between the seamounts, in association with modifications in taxa composition, size diversity, and the slope of the size spectrum. Community respiration was significantly correlated to these community descriptors, suggesting the composition of the pelagic community has a direct impact on the total amount of respired-C.

Thus, we measured a suite of physiological variables in the corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus) after exposure to field-parameterized, fluctuating temperature regimes (moderate temperature and heat wave treatments) to address two hypotheses: (1) a heat wave causes physiological stress, and (2) thermal performance of immune function exhibits adaptive plasticity in response to a heat wave. We found little support for our first hypothesis because a simulated heat wave had a negative effect on body mass, but it also reduced oxidative damage and did not affect peak performance of three immune metrics. Likewise, we found only partial support for our second hypothesis. After exposure to a simulated heat wave, P. guttatus exhibited greater performance breadth and reduced temperature specialization (the standardized difference between peak performance and performance breadth) for only one of three immune metrics and did so in a sex-dependent manner. Further, a simulated heat wave did not elicit greater performance of any immune metric at higher temperatures. Yet a heat wave likely reduced innate immune function in P. guttatus because each metric of innate immune performance in this species (as in most vertebrates) was lower at elevated temperatures.

For example, freshwater zooplankton with different life-history strategies, such as sexual or parthenogenetic reproduction, may respond differently to increased mean temperatures and rapid temperature fluctuations. Therefore, we conducted a long-term (18months) mesocosm experiment where we evaluated the effects of increased mean temperature (4 degrees C) and an identical energy input but delivered through temperature fluctuations, i.e., as heat waves. We show that different rotifer prey species have specific temperature requirements and use limited and species-specific temperature windows for recruiting from the sediment. On the contrary, co-occurring predatory cyclopoid copepods recruit from adult or subadult resting stages and are therefore able to respond to short-term temperature fluctuations. Hence, these different life-history strategies affect the interactions between cyclopoid copepods and rotifers by reducing the risk of a temporal mismatch in predator-prey dynamics in a climate change scenario. Thus, we conclude that predatory cyclopoid copepods with long generation time are likely to benefit from heat waves since they rapidly wake up even at short temperature elevations and thereby suppress fast reproducing prey populations, such as rotifers. In a broader perspective, our findings suggest that differences in life-history traits will affect predator-prey interactions, and thereby alter community dynamics, in a future climate change scenario.",,,,,"Chaguaceda, Fernando/AAO-2991-2020","Chaguaceda, Fernando/0000-0002-0827-2110",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,OCT,2018,24,10,,,,,4747,4757,,10.1111/gcb.14371,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14371,,,,,,,,29963731,,,,,WOS:000445728800023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two lipase conformations representing the active and inactive forms were simulated in 5 solvents including water, ethanol, methanol, cyclohexane, and toluene. Low temperature simulations showed that polar solvents led to enhanced lid fluctuations compared with non-polar solvents reflecting a more dynamic equilibrium between active and inactive lipase conformations in polar solvents including water, while the overall structure of the lipase in both forms became more rigid in non-polar solvents than they were in polar solvent. Notably, the native lipase fold was maintained in non-polar solvents even at high temperatures, indicating an enhancement of lipase's thermostability in non-polar organic solvents. Next, we conducted experiments for which BTL2 was expressed in a heterologous host and purified to homogeneity, and its thermostability in different solvents was assessed. Parallel to the computational findings, experimental results suggested that non-polar organic solvents contributed to BTL2's thermostability at concentrations as high as 70% (v/v). Altogether, this study provides beneficial insights to the lipase use under extreme conditions.

However, remote locations have constrained most studies to using uncontrolled, passive enclosures. Here we present an improved prototype of our Free Air Temperature Increase (FATI) system, an apparatus to elevate vegetation temperature in the open field by electronically modulated infrared irradiation. Three modifications are introduced to enhance precision and repeatability: (1) noncontact sensing of canopy temperature (T-canopy) with semiconductors, (2) an optimizing device to attune individual FATI-units, and (3) high-speed data logging. Performance tests in the High hectic tundra of northeast Greenland during autumn 1998 demonstrated more reproducible warming compared with the original system: average increments of canopy temperature (Delta T-canopy) obtained in different patches of vegetation varied no more than 0.16 degrees C. Most fluctuation in Delta T-canopy was also eliminated, with instantaneous values within +/-0.5 degrees C of the target increment of +2.5 degrees C for at least 87% of the time. Average: warming in the upper soil layers was close to average Delta T-canopy, and decreased gradually with depth from +2.7 degrees C at 2.5 cm to +2.0 degrees C at 20 cm below the surface (means for three FATI-units).

We incubated a decomposed and compacted fen peat and investigated in two experiments 1) the vertical distribution of CO2 and CH4 production rates and their response to drying and 2) the effects of temperature, drying intensity and duration on CO2 production rates and on CH4 production recovery after rewetting. Surface peat down to 5 cm contributed up to 67% (CO2) and above 80% (CH4) of the depth-aggregated (50 cm) production. As CO2 production sharply decreased with depth water table fluctuations in deeper peat layers are thus not expected to cause a substantial increase in soil respiration in this site. Compared to anaerobic water saturated conditions drying increased peat CO2 production by a factor between 1.4 and 2.1. Regarding the effects of the studied factors, warmer conditions increased and prolonged drying duration decreased CO2 production whereas the soil moisture level had little influence. No significant interactions among factors were found. Short dry events under warmer conditions are likely to result in greatest peaks of CO2 production rates. Upon rewetting, CH4 production was monitored over time and the recovery was standardized to pre-drying levels to compare the treatment effects. Methane production increased non-linearly over time and all factors (temperature, drying intensity and duration) influenced the pattern of post-drying CH4 production. Peat undergoing more intense and longer drying events required a longer lag time before substantial CH4 production occurred and warmer conditions appeared to speed up the process.

We also assessed fluctuations in the population size of O. punicae and N. californicus in commercial avocado orchards; correlations among mite density and air temperature, humidity, and precipitation in commercial avocado orchards; and the correlations between prey and predator populations. The no-choice test revealed that N. californicus adult females fed on O. punicae of all developmental stages, with higher levels of predation being recorded for eggs, followed by larvae. The highest oviposition values of N. californicus females were observed when females were fed O. punicae eggs. In orchards, the populations of both mites increased between February and June. The populations peaked during the warmest months of the year, with O. punicae populations peaking between June and July and N. californicus peaking in August.

We compared these temperatures with temperatures of a bare wall and we found that all four types of green facades were able to maintain lower temperatures than the bare wall, and that the felt layer and planter boxes wall had lower temperatures than the other walls for the majority of the study period. In particular, the daily average and peak surface temperatures behind the felt layer wall were by 1.9 degrees C-4.8 degrees C and by 7.1 degrees C-13.4 degrees C respectively lower than the bare wall. We undertook a significance analysis and produced Pearson coefficients to better understand the relationship between average daily weather conditions and the surface temperatures on all five test cells. We noted that the average daily solar radiation flux did not affect the surface temperatures behind the planter boxes and felt layer walls, but the daily average ambient air temperature was significantly correlated with the average and peak surface temperatures behind all four green facades. Finally, we concluded that the cooling potential of the felt layer and the planter boxes walls increases with higher amounts of solar radiation and higher ambient temperatures. In addition, from the analysis of the diurnal temperature variations and the time series trends we illustrated that the temperatures behind the felt layer and planter boxes walls fluctuated less than the other walls, which lead to a slower rate of surface temperature reductions during a cooler day than the other wall types of the study.

In 1994, two 60 m long, 2.8 m high snow fences, one in moist and the other in dry tundra, were erected at Toolik Lake, Alaska. OTCs paired with unwarmed plots, were placed along each experimental snow gradient and in control areas adjacent to the snowdrifts. After 8 years, the vegetation of the two sites, including that in control plots, had changed significantly. At both sites, the cover of shrubs, live vegetation, and litter, together with canopy height, had all increased, while lichen cover and diversity had decreased. At the moist site, bryophytes decreased in cover, while an increase in graminoids was almost entirely because of the response of the sedge Eriophorum vaginatum. These community changes were consistent with results found in studies of responses to warming and increased nutrient availability in the Arctic. However, during the time period of the experiment, summer temperature did not increase, but summer precipitation increased by 28%. The snow addition treatment affected species abundance, canopy height, and diversity, whereas the summer warming treatment had few measurable effects on vegetation. The interannual temperature fluctuation was considerably larger than the temperature increases within OTCs (< 2 degrees C), however. Snow addition also had a greater effect on microclimate by insulating vegetation from winter wind and temperature extremes, modifying winter soil temperatures, and increasing spring run-off. Most increases in shrub cover and canopy height occurred in the medium snow-depth zone (0.5-2 m) of the moist site, and the medium to deep snow-depth zone (2-3 m) of the dry site. At the moist tundra site, deciduous shrubs, particularly Betula nana, increased in cover, while evergreen shrubs decreased. These differential responses were likely because of the larger production to biomass ratio in deciduous shrubs, combined with their more flexible growth response under changing environmental conditions. At the dry site, where deciduous shrubs were a minor part of the vegetation, evergreen shrubs increased in both cover and canopy height. These changes in abundance of functional groups are expected to affect most ecological processes, particularly the rate of litter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and both soil carbon and nitrogen pools. Also, changes in canopy structure, associated with increases in shrub abundance, are expected to alter the summer energy balance by increasing net radiation and evapotranspiration, thus altering soil moisture regimes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,APR,2005,11,4,,,,,537,552,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00927.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00927.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000228179500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The diurnal temperature fluctuation on the surface of cattle was monitored. The temperature tolerance of M. anisopliae isolates (ARSEF3297 and IMI386697) was determined and their pathogenicity to B. microplits compared at a standard bioassay temperature (28 degrees C) and at a temperature similar to the cattle surface (31-35 degrees). The effect of the two isolates on the B. microplus population on cattle under field conditions was determined. The temperature of the fore udder, rear udder, ribs and neck regions of the mixed Holstein cattle fluctuated between 30 and 35 degrees C, in a similar pattern to the prevailing environmental temperature. However, wider fluctuations were obtained on the ears (28-35 degrees C) and spine (30-41 degrees C). The colony radius of both isolates declined as temperature increased, however, the growth of IMI386697 was five times greater than ARSEF3297 at 34 degrees C.

Simulations were initialized using Global Forecast System data. The analyses were updated with the three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) technique using PrepBUFR and radiance observational data in a time window of +/- 3 h. The potential added value of data assimilation was addressed by comparing meteorological variables such as relative humidity, zonal and meridional wind components, 2 m temperature, and rainfall with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite-derived rainfall product datasets. WRF accurately simulated the spatiotemporal propagation and the zonally extended structure of rainfall as well as of relative humidity, 2 m temperature, and horizontal wind components. DA exhibited different biases, root mean square error, and spatial correlation, leading to mixed results in terms of outperforming CNTL. Results indicated that there was an increment in control variables, implying an added value from 3DVAR to the initial and boundary conditions. Rainfall forecasts were improved by 15-25 %.

The experiments aimed to identify after-ripening patterns, and to relate these to climatic conditions of the habitat in which the species occur. Seeds of all species were strongly dormant at maturity and maintained high levels of dormancy for time periods corresponding to the duration of summer in south-western Australia. Dry after-ripening was promoted best by temperatures lower than those prevailing in the dry season, although differences among storage temperatures were mostly insignificant. Germination percentages were highest at average winter temperatures (15 degreesC). A logistic model revealed significant differences in germinability among species, but not between incubation temperatures or light and dark treatments across species. Three species with seeds >0.5 mg germinated better in darkness than in light, whereas germination in darkness was almost inhibited in the species with the smallest seeds (0.14 mg). The course of dormancy loss, tested over a range of fluctuating incubation temperatures (7-30 degreesC), showed that seeds of three species came out of dormancy first at temperatures that prevail in south-western Australia during the winter (10-15 degreesC). Seeds from one species, introduced from South Africa, first lost dormancy at the lowest temperature (7 degreesC). All species showed after-ripening patterns of Type 1, typical of species growing in Mediterranean climates. The germination characteristics of the investigated species can be interpreted as ensuring that initial growth and establishment occur during the winter growing season, thereby avoiding the hot and dry summer conditions that follow seed dispersal.

In these often mesic systems, soil moisture and temperature tend to co-regulate soil respiration. Increasing variance of rainfall patterns may alter aboveground-belowground interactions and have important implications for the sensitivity of soil respiration to fluctuations in moisture and temperature. We conducted a set of field experiments to evaluate the independent and interactive effects of rainfall variability and plant-soil processes on respiration dynamics. Plant removal had strong effects on grassland soils, which included altered CO2 flux owing to absence of root respiration; increased soil moisture and temperature; and reduced availability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for heterotrophic respiration by microorganisms. These plant-mediated effects interacted with our rainfall variability treatments to determine the sensitivity of soil respiration to both moisture and temperature. Using time-series multiple regression, we found that plants dampened the sensitivity of respiration to moisture under high variability rainfall treatments, which may reflect the relative stability of root contributions to total soil respiration. In contrast, plants increased the sensitivity of respiration to temperature under low variability rainfall treatment suggesting that the environmental controls on soil CO2 dynamics in mesic habitats may be context dependent. Our results provide insight into the aboveground-belowground mechanisms controlling respiration in grasslands under variable rainfall regimes, which may be important for predicting CO2 dynamics under current and future climate scenarios.",,,,,"Lennon, Jay T./ABE-6120-2020","Lennon, Jay T./0000-0003-3126-6111; Schoolmaster Jr., Donald/0000-0003-0910-4458",,,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,JAN,2011,14,1,,,,,156,167,,10.1007/s10021-010-9401-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-010-9401-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000288172000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this purpose common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) was gown in a pot experiment with no P fertilization (P-0 = 0 kg P/ha) and with P fertilization (P-1 = 87 kg P/ha), and P supply rate was assessed using a specially pretreated anion exchange membrane encased in a plastic applicator buried in the soil for 2-week intervals. Cumulative P supply rate was also calculated at the end of the growing season. Soil moisture content was kept at field capacity and soil temperature was recorded daily throughout the growing season. Results showed that resin membranes assessed considerably greater soil P supply rate in the treatments including P fertilization compared to the control either in pots planted with common vetch or in bare soil. Without root competition (unplanted pots) soil P supply rate ranged on average from 3.89 g ion/10 cm(2)/2 weeks (P-0) to 59.28 g ion/10 cm(2)/2 weeks (P-1). When root completion was considered (pots planted with common vetch) P supply rate varied on average from 2.70 g ion/10 cm(2)/2 week (P-0) to 44.91 g ion/10 cm(2)/2 week (P-1). Under the same P treatment, soil ion movement processes (i.e., ion diffusion) that can be modified by the presence of root hairs may explain the small differences in absolute values between planted and unplanted pots. The cumulative value of P supply rate was significantly lower in the treatment with common vetch plants and fertilizer addition than under bare soil and the same amount of fertilizer. Yield-related parameters and P concentration in aboveground plant parts were comparable to those referred in the literature. The P supply rate was more closely related to P uptake by plants (r(2) = 0.96), which is considered strong evidence that this method of availability estimation is effective and may be used for this purpose. The PRS probes under controlled soil conditions with respect to temperature and moisture may estimate P supply rates to common vetch plants successfully. They seem to be capable of differentiating P supply in fertilized soils and give results significantly correlated to yield parameters of this crop. However, it is not recommended to use them for making fertilizer recommendations before they are tested under natural conditions, especially in dry environments.",,,,,"Tsadilas, Christos/AAZ-7408-2020; Vlachostergios, Dimitrios/AAH-8359-2020; Noulas, Christos/B-6053-2018","Tsadilas, Christos/0000-0002-5634-4561; Noulas, Christos/0000-0002-1087-2203; Vlachostergios, Dimitrios/0000-0001-7252-1719",,,,,,,,,,,,,0010-3624,1532-2416,,,,JAN 1,2013,44,1-4,,,SI,,275,286,,10.1080/00103624.2013.741866,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2013.741866,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000322303100027,View Full Record in Web of Science

The dogfish liver was not included in the waste utilized. The protein content of dogfish silage was adequate (approximately 14.9%, Kjeldahl nitrogen corrected for urea nitrogen). The fat in dogfish silage included triglycerides at approximately 81% of total lipid. The high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (approximately 28% of total fatty acids) in this lipid was comparable to that of other fish lipids employed in salmonid diets. Two sets of experiments were conducted with Atlantic salmon to evaluate the suitability of dogfish-silage-based diets. In both, three moist diets based on ground herring (control), on herring silage, and on dogfish silage were tested for 9 weeks. The studies were conducted in two phases based on salmon averaging respectively 190 or 490 g. These were fed twice daily to apparent satiation (water temperature range 5-14-degrees-C, 12 h photoperiod). Although the urea content was nearly 0.5% in the dogfish silage diet, there was no apparent decrease in palatability for salmon in the experiment with larger fish. However, there was a decrease in the palatability of both herring and dogfish silage diets fed to the smaller fish, probably due to their being stored for 8 weeks at room temperature prior to diet formulation. The addition of natural tocopherols in the preparation of silage for the larger fish kept the lipid oxidation levels acceptable (peroxide value < 5 mEq/kg) for the 15 days of storage before making the diets. In the second study with larger fish, there were no significant differences among the diets in weight gain, feed efficiency, and protein efficiency ratio. These parameters had been significantly higher in the smaller fish fed the ground herring control diet. A sensory evaluation was conducted with the salmon fillets from both studies where the fish fed on different diets were compared. No significant differences were detected in either experiment.

This means that buildings are responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. It's time to reduce this energy consumption to limit the environmental impact of buildings. The use of high thermal inertia envelopes could be a solution to reduce energy consumption of the building. The thermal inertia is characterize by time lag and decrement factor. This work deals with the experimental determination of time lag and decrement factor of a building envelope. For this purpose, a test cell of 1 m(3) made of stabilized earth brick is built at the Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar. Stabilized earth bricks are commonly used in Senegal. The time lag and the decrement factor are calculated using the ambient-air temperature inside a test cell and the outdoor average equivalent temperature. The results show that the time lag of a test cell envelope is about 6 h and the decrement factor about 0.4. This reduces the energy needed to cool the building during warm periods, as fluctuations in the outside temperature are not felt. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

The results indicated that the factors affecting leaf transpiration, such as solar radiation, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature and water stress, affect the timing and amplitude of diurnal fluctuations in diameter of bell pepper fruit. Earlier fruit shrinkage start time (FSST) in the morning, earlier fruit shrinkage ending time (FSET) in the afternoon and larger shrinkage amount were observed in fruits grown in the greenhouse with high night air temperature and low night vapour pressure deficit. Plant root water stress resulted in earlier FSST. Higher incoming radiation increased fruit shrinkage.

The experiment had a 2 x 4 factorial design:the first factor was the population of tilapia (mixed-sex and 95% males) and the second factor was the proportion of Nile tilapia:Mayan cichlid (3:1, 5:1, 7:1 and 1:0). Proportion of 1:0 was tilapia monoculture. At stocking, tilapias were 11 weeks old and weighed 24.0 g and Mayan cichlids weighed 5.0 g. Recirculating water systems were used, with 24 fiberglass tanks 1 m(3) with permanent water flow (7 L min(-1)) and aeration. Each treatment had 3 replicates distributed randomly, and 24 fish were introduced in each tank (30 fish m(-3)). The experiment lasted 21 weeks, until tilapia reached marketable size. Fish were fed with extruded formulated diets for tilapia (40% and 30% crude protein). Daily feeding rate was restricted to between 4% and 1.8% of the fish biomass. Temperature, DO and pH (28.0 +/- 1.1 degrees C, 5.2 +/- 1.2 mg L-1 and 7.9 +/- 0.2) were within the appropriate ranges for growth, and TAN, nitrites and total alkalinity (0.29 +/- 0.22 mg L-1, 0.04 +/- 0.03 mg L-1 and 238 +/- 27 mg L-1) were within safe ranges. Average survival was high (99%) and no differences were found between populations and among proportions. Nile tilapia Stirling strain showed early (45 g after 3 experimental weeks) sexual maturation and growth dimorphism. Significantly better total yield, FCR and final tilapia body weight were obtained in the 95% male population (9.26 kg m(-3), 1.39 and 383 g) than in the mixed-sex population (7.70 kg m(-3), 1.52 and 315 g). The presence of the Mayan cichlid did not affect tilapia performance. The final weight of Mayan cichlid was significantly higher in the mixed-sex tilapia population (45.9 g) than in the 95% male population (34.4 g). Mayan cichlid growth was inversely proportional to its density, with final weights of 45.5 g, 39.0 g and 34.3 g (7:1 > 5:1 > 3:1). The differences in Mayan cichlid growth are associated with intraspecific competition for available tilapia larvae. Mouth brooding tilapia females with eggs or larvae were observed in both tilapia populations and in all proportions. When fish were weighed some tilapia females released their larvae in the tanks, and both Mayan cichlid and tilapia males were observed preying on them. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Haxeltine, A; Prentice, IC",,,,"Haxeltine, A; Prentice, IC",,,A general model for the light-use efficiency of primary production,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Net primary production (NPP) by terrestrial ecosystems appears to be proportional to absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) on a seasonal and annual basis. This observation has been used in 'diagnostic' models that estimate NPP from remotely sensed vegetation indices. In 'prognostic' process-based models carbon fluxes are more commonly integrated with respect to leaf area index assuming invariant leaf photosynthetic parameters. This approach does not lead to a proportional relationship between NPP and APAR. However, leaf nitrogen content and Rubisco activity are known to vary seasonally and with canopy position, and there is evidence that this variation takes place in such a way as to nearly optimize total canopy net photosynthesis. 2. Using standard formulations for the instantaneous response of leaf net photosynthesis to APAR, we show that the optimized canopy net photosynthesis is proportional to APAR. This theory leads to reasonable values for the maximum (unstressed) light-use efficiency of gross and net primary production of C-3 plants at current ambient CO2, comparable with empirical estimates for agricultural crops and forest plantations. 3. By relating the standard formulations to the Collatz-Farquhar model of photosynthesis, we show that a range of observed physiological responses to temperature and CO2 can be understood as consequences of the optimization. These responses include the CO2 fertilization response and stomatal closure in C-3 plants, the increase of leaf N concentration with decreasing growing season temperature, and the downward acclimation of leaf respiration and N content with increasing ambient CO2. The theory provides a way to integrate diverse experimental observations into a general framework for modelling terrestrial primary production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,OCT,1996,10,5,,,,,551,561,,10.2307/2390165,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2390165,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996WC88000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aims of this work were to predict B. coagulans spores inactivation in tomato pulp under varying time-temperature profiles with Gompertz-inspired inactivation model and to validate the model's predictions by comparing the predicted values with experimental data. B. coagulans spores in pH 4.3 tomato pulp at 4 degrees Brix were sealed in capillary glass tubes and heated in thermostatically controlled circulating oil baths. Seven different nonisothermal profiles in the range from 95 to 105 degrees C were studied. Predicted inactivation kinetics showed similar behavior to experimentally observed inactivation curves when the samples were exposed to temperatures in the upper range of this study (99 to 105 degrees C). Profiles that resulted in less accurate predictions were those where the range of temperatures analyzed were comparatively lower (inactivation profiles starting at 95 degrees C). The link between fail prediction and both lower starting temperature and magnitude of the temperature shift suggests some chemical or biological mechanism at work. Statistical analysis showed that overall model predictions were acceptable, with bias factors from 0.781 to 1.012, and accuracy factors from 1.049 to 1.351, and confirm that the models used were adequate to estimate B. coagulans spores inactivation under fluctuating temperature conditions in the range from 95 to 105 degrees C.

Male floral buds showed more adverse effects than female floral buds under temperature treatment. Temperature treatment experiments revealed that temperature treatment significantly increased catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activities and transcription of related genes in female floral buds, whereas malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly increased only in males. Soluble sugars and protein increased both in female and male floral buds but were higher in males.

The major findings of this study are that spatial variability of cumulative precipitation decreases exponentially with time, and, on average, became spatially uniform after 20 years of precipitation accumulation. The spatial variability of high-intensity, runoff-producing precipitation also decreased exponentially, but the variability was still well above the measurement error after 51 years. There were no significant temporal trends in basin scale precipitation.

This paper summarizes seasonal and interannual fluctuations of energy and water balance components in two distinctive semiarid ecosystems, sagebrush (SB) and lodgepole pine (LP) in the Snake River basin of Idaho. This study includes 6 years (2011-2016) of eddy covariance (EC) along with modeled estimates. An analysis of the energy balance indicated a higher energy balance ratio (0.88) for SB than for LP (0.86). The inclusion of canopy storage (CS) increased the association between turbulent fluxes and available energy in LP. Green vegetation fraction (GVF) significantly controlled evapotranspiration (ET) and surface energy partitioning when available energy and soil moisture were not limited. Seasonal water balance in the Budyko framework showed severe water-limited conditions in SB (6-9 months) compared to LP (6-7 months). Based on the validated Noah land surface model estimates, direct soil evaporation (E-Soil) is the main component of ET (62 to 79%) in SB due to a large proportion of bare soil (60%), whereas at the lodgepole pine site, it was transpiration (E-Tran, 42-52%). A complementary ratio (CR) analysis on ET and potential ET (PET) showed a strong asymmetric CR in SB, indicating significant advection. Both SG and LP showed strong coupling between soil moisture (SM) and air temperature (T-a). However, a weak coupling was observed in SB when the soil was dry and T-a was high. This weak coupling was due to the presence of net advection.

In a first experiment, soil disturbance and fire were applied to plots in the field with a factorial design in April 1992. In a second experiment, we measured the effect of adding C. clusii litter. The number of seedlings, annual plants and grasses, and the coverage of mosses were recorded in 1993 and 1994. Soil disturbance increased the number of C. clusii seedlings almost seven-fold but did not change the number of grasses, annual plants nor moss cover. Fire significantly increased the number of C. clusii seedlings only in combination with soil disturbance, and it did not affect the presence of annuals, grasses nor moss cover Litter increased the number of C. clusii seedlings in the following two years. Overall, soil disturbance as a single factor had the most significant effect on seedling emergence, though plots disturbed and treated with fire had the highest number of seedlings, implying that germination of C, clusii seeds was enhanced by processes that alter the hard seed coat and break the physical dormancy imposed by the testa.

Closure of the incision, as measured with a 5-point scale (1 = fresh wound, 5 = no longer visible), weight gain, and inflammation (skin temperature and swelling, as measured by scrotal circumference) were recorded on d 1, 3, 7, 11, 15, 18, 21, 25, 32, 39, 45, 61, and 77 after the procedure, until all incisions were fully healed. On these same days, pain sensitivity was assessed by applying a known and increasing force with von Frey hairs (0.02 to 300 g-force) at the edge of the castration wound and at a control site, approximately 2 to 5 cm anterior to the teats, until animals showed a behavioral response or the highest force was reached. The incisions of younger calves healed more quickly than older ones [fully healed, median (95% confidence interval); 39 (32 to 61) vs. 61 (61 to 77) d; P = 0.002], however, they had relatively more swelling in the days after castration (P < 0.001). Younger animals reacted to lighter pressure of von Frey hairs compared to older calves especially in the first stages of healing process (P < 0.001), and there were other signs indicative of inflammation processes in this region at this time. However, there was no difference in the control site for either age group. In addition, it took longer for older calves to recover their daily weight gain after the procedure (P < 0.001). Taken together, these results paint a mixed picture about the effects of age of surgical castration.

A synthesis of manipulation experiments,BIOGEOSCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a key component of the carbon cycle, soil CO2 efflux (SCE) is being increasingly studied to improve our mechanistic understanding of this important carbon flux. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change often depends on extrapolation of current relationships between ecosystem processes and their climatic drivers to conditions not yet experienced by the ecosystem. This raises the question of to what extent these relationships remain unaltered beyond the current climatic window for which observations are available to constrain the relationships. Here, we evaluate whether current responses of SCE to fluctuations in soil temperature and soil water content can be used to predict SCE under altered rainfall patterns. Of the 58 experiments for which we gathered SCE data, 20 were discarded because either too few data were available or inconsistencies precluded their incorporation in the analyses. The 38 remaining experiments were used to test the hypothesis that a model parameterized with data from the control plots (using soil temperature and water content as predictor variables) could adequately predict SCE measured in the manipulated treatment. Only for 7 of these 38 experiments was this hypothesis rejected. Importantly, these were the experiments with the most reliable data sets, i.e., those providing high-frequency measurements of SCE. Regression tree analysis demonstrated that our hypothesis could be rejected only for experiments with measurement intervals of less than 11 days, and was not rejected for any of the 24 experiments with larger measurement intervals. This highlights the importance of high-frequency measurements when studying effects of altered precipitation on SCE, probably because infrequent measurement schemes have insufficient capacity to detect shifts in the climate dependencies of SCE. Hence, the most justified answer to the question of whether current moisture responses of SCE can be extrapolated to predict SCE under altered precipitation regimes is 'no' - as based on the most reliable data sets available. We strongly recommend that future experiments focus more strongly on establishing response functions across a broader range of precipitation regimes and soil moisture conditions. Such experiments should make accurate measurements of water availability, should conduct high-frequency SCE measurements, and should consider both instantaneous responses and the potential legacy effects of climate extremes. This is important, because with the novel approach presented here, we demonstrated that, at least for some ecosystems, current moisture responses could not be extrapolated to predict SCE under altered rainfall conditions.",,,,,"Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Marshall, Miles/G-5410-2011; Arain, M.

It is important to identify factors to reduce the bio-burden of E. coil O157 in feedlots by clarifying practices associated with the occurrence of super-shedders in feedlot cattle. Methods: The objective of this study is to (1) identify host, pathogen, and management risk factors associated with naturally infected feedlot cattle excreting high concentrations of E. coil O157:H7 in their feces and (2) to determine whether the ingested dose or the specific strain of E. coli O157:H7 influences a super-shedder infection within experimentally inoculated feedlot cattle. To address this, (1) pen floor fecal samples and herd parameters were collected from four feedlots over a 9-month period, then (2) 6 strains of E. coil O157:H7, 3 strains isolated from normal shedder steers and 3 strains isolated from super-shedder steers, were inoculated into 30 one-year-old feedlot steers. Five steers were assigned to each E. coli O157:H7 strain group and inoculated with targeted numbers of 10(2), 10(4), 10(6), 10(8), and 10(10) CFU of bacteria respectively. Results: In the feedlots, prevalence of infection with E. coli O157:H7 for the 890 fecal samples collected was 22.4%, with individual pen prevalence ranging from 0% to 90% and individual feedlot prevalence ranging from 8.4% to 30.2%. Three samples had E. coil O157:H7 levels greater than 10(4) MPN/g feces, thereby meeting the definition of super-shedder. Lower body weight at entry to the feedlot and higher daily maximum ambient temperature were associated with increased odds of a sample testing positive for E. coli O157:H7. In the experimental inoculation trial, the duration and total environmental shedding load of E. coli O157:H7 suggests that the time post-inoculation and the dose of inoculated E. coli O157:H7 are important while the E. coli O157:H7 strain and shedding characteristic (normal or supershedder) are not. Discussion: Under the conditions of this experiment, super-shedding appears to be the result of cattle ingesting a high dose of any strain of E. coli O157:H7. Therefore strategies that minimize exposure to large numbers of E. coli O157:H7 should be beneficial against the super-shedding of E. coli O157:H7 in feedlots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,DEC 20,2021,9,,,,,,,,e12524,10.7717/peerj.12524,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12524,,,,,,,,35036119,,,,,WOS:000734634500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Samples of infested growing shoots were taken and die winged animals were collected using a sweepnet Five samples were collected with 20 net sweeps each. In each sampling area, five specimens per sex were clarified and the genitalia of the females and the males were removed from the rest of the abdomen. The biological cycle was performed in laboratory conditions. Thirty Petri dishes were used as rearing units, with five repetitions in time. A recently emerged couple was introduced in each experimental unit and the morphological and behavioral changes in the different stages of the H. cubana were observed daily through the stereoscopic microscope. The position and dispersion statistics were determined for each indicator. The results demonstrated that all the psyllids collected in the adult stage in sowings of L. leucocephala in different regions of the country correspond to H. cubana. The polymorphism in the nymph and the adult populations of H. cubana was evident. The dimensions of the insect vary in each stage. In the egg stage, they measured approximately 0.6 mm of length and 0.3 mm of width. The nymph stage starts with similar dimensions to those of the eggs, up to 1.4 mm of length and 0.7 mm of width, approximately. In the adults, the dimensions range from 1.5 to 2 nun of length, with average duration of 17 d for the adult-egg cycle. The values in the periods of pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition were in the interval from two to three days. The influence of the temperature on the length of the biological cycle of the insect was demonstrated. It is concluded that Heteropsylla cubana Crawford was the species found in the areas of L. leucocephala in the different regions sampled in Cuba. Its life cycle is composed of five nymph stages, with average egg-adult duration of 17 d. The periods of pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition were between two and three days, favourable range for the adequate reproduction of the insect. Further taxonomical and biological studies are recommended as basis for the diagnosis of the species, as well as the perfection of the sampling methodology. Besides, the proliferation of adults should be considered. All these aspects are indispensable tools for establishing alternatives to standardize the insect management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0864-0408,,,,,SEP,2004,38,3,,,,,297,306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000228173500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

When supercooling points were compared for Russian wheat aphid life-stages (first instar through adult), there were no significant differences. However, when different life-stages of aphids from two rearing environments were compared, third-instar Russian wheat aphids reared at room temperature in a greenhouse supercooled significantly lower than those reared at sub-zero temperatures on plants in the field. This significance is due to variation in supercooling and not a result of acclimation. The average supercooling point for all Russian wheat aphid life-stages was -27.6 degreesC. There were no seasonal changes in supercooling points for fourth instar Russian wheat aphids reared at room temperature versus those reared under fluctuating subzero temperature in the field. Supercooling points of wheat leaf tissue averaged -2.8 degreesC in the fall and -7.3 degreesC in the winter. Variation in wheat leaf tissue supercooling increased from fail to winter as a result of cell damage caused by freeze-thaw cycles, indicating that host quality for Russian wheat aphids will decrease as the winter. progresses. These findings contribute to a better knowledge of the understanding of the success or failure of Russian wheat aphid overwintering that are the prerequisite to management strategics.",,,,,"Nielsen, David C/A-8044-2009","Nielsen, David C/0000-0002-8240-7183",,,,,,,,,,,,,0147-1724,,,,,DEC,2000,25,4,,,,,265,272,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000167130900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The EC data set covers 4 cropping seasons with highly resolved emission rates (raw data in 10 Hz frequency have been aggregated to 30-min records). The diel patterns were very pronounced in the two dry seasons with peak emissions at early afternoon and low emissions at nighttime. These diel patterns were observed at all growing stages of the dry seasons. In the two wet seasons, the diel patterns were only visible during the vegetative stages while emission rates during reproductive and ripening stages remained within a fairly steady range and did not show any diel patterns. In totality, however, the data set revealed a very strong linear relationship between nocturnal emissions (12-h periods) and the full 24-h periods resulting in an R-2-value of 0.8419 for all data points. In the second experiment, we conducted test runs for chamber measurements at nighttime with much longer deployment times (6 h) as compared to measurements at daylight (typically for 30 min). Conducting chamber measurements at nighttime excluded drastic changes of temperatures and CO2 concentrations. The data also shows that increases in CH4 concentrations remained on linear trajectory over a 6h period at night. While end CH4 concentrations were consistently >3.5 ppm, this long-term enclosure represents a very robust approach to quantify emissions as compared to assessing short-term concentration increases over time near the analytical detection limit. Finally, we have discussed the potential applications of this new approach that would allow emission measurements even when conventional (daytime) measurements will not be suitable. Nighttime chamber measurements offer an alternative to conventional (daytime) measurements if either (i) baseline emissions are at a very low level, (ii) differences of tested crop treatments or varieties are very small or (iii) the objective is to screen a large number of rice varieties for taking advantage of progress in genome sequencing.",,,,,"Nghia, Hoang Trong/AAK-4905-2021","Nghia, Hoang Trong/0000-0002-6700-7018",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,FEB 1,2018,13,2,,,,,,,e0191352,10.1371/journal.pone.0191352,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0191352,,,,,,,,29390000,,,,,WOS:000423793400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

This information is obtained from experiments carried out under specific geoclimatic conditions, which determine their application in forensic environments under similar conditions. The field study presented here is the first in Chile to analyse the decomposition process of pig carcasses and the associated succession of insects, colonising species and parameters related to larval masses. All of the larvae obtained from daily samples were measured (in mm), and their mean, range, standard deviation and stage of development (instars) were determined. The carcasses reached the dry remains stage in only 11 days. Seven species of Diptera visited the carcass during the process, but only two species colonised it by means of egg deposition followed by development of larvae: Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius) and Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae), which exhibited a duration of the development cycle from egg to adult of 21 days. The collected Coleoptera correspond to five predator species (Staphilinidae and Histeridae). From the results of this study, it can be concluded that only some of the insect species present in this region can provide information that can be used in forensic entomology and that analysis of larval masses of colonising species can be a valuable tool for determining the PMImin in this region of Chile.

J,"Noetzli, J; Gruber, S",,,,"Noetzli, J.; Gruber, S.",,,Transient thermal effects in Alpine permafrost,CRYOSPHERE,,,,,,,,,,,,"In high mountain areas, permafrost is important because it influences the occurrence of natural hazards, because it has to be considered in construction practices, and because it is sensitive to climate change. The assessment of its distribution and evolution is challenging because of highly variable conditions at and below the surface, steep topography and varying climatic conditions. This paper presents a systematic investigation of effects of topography and climate variability that are important for subsurface temperatures in Alpine bedrock permafrost. We studied the effects of both, past and projected future ground surface temperature variations on the basis of numerical experimentation with simplified mountain topography in order to demonstrate the principal effects. The modeling approach applied combines a distributed surface energy balance model and a three-dimensional subsurface heat conduction scheme. Results show that the past climate variations that essentially influence present-day permafrost temperatures at depth of the idealized mountains are the last glacial period and the major fluctuations in the past millennium. Transient effects from projected future warming, however, are likely larger than those from past climate conditions because larger temperature changes at the surface occur in shorter time periods. We further demonstrate the accelerating influence of multi-lateral warming in steep and complex topography for a temperature signal entering the subsurface as compared to the situation in flat areas. The effects of varying and uncertain material properties (i.e., thermal properties, porosity, and freezing characteristics) on the subsurface temperature field were examined in sensitivity studies. A considerable influence of latent heat due to water in low-porosity bedrock was only shown for simulations over time periods of decades to centuries. At the end, the model was applied to the topographic setting of the Matterhorn (Switzerland). Results from idealized geometries are compared to this first example of real topography, and possibilities as well as limitations of the model application are discussed.",,,,,"Noetzli, Jeannette/ABA-4132-2020; Gruber, Stephan/E-3884-2010","Noetzli, Jeannette/0000-0001-9188-6318; Gruber, Stephan/0000-0002-1079-1542",,,,,,,,,,,,,1994-0416,1994-0424,,,,,2009,3,1,,,,,85,99,,10.5194/tc-3-85-2009,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-3-85-2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000276161100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The models are two Earth system models and two atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. The periodogram, detrended fluctuation analysis and wavelet variance analysis are applied to examine scaling properties and to estimate a scaling exponent of the temperature records. A simple linear model for the climate response to external forcing is also applied to the reconstruction and the forced climate model runs, and then compared to unforced control runs to extract the LRM generated by internal dynamics of the climate system. The climate models show strong persistent scaling with power spectral densities of the form S(f) similar to f(-beta) with 0.8 < beta < 1 on timescales from years to several centuries. This is somewhat stronger persistence than found in the reconstruction (beta approximate to 0.7). We find no indication that LRM found in these model runs is induced by external forcing, which suggests that LRM on sub-decadal to century time scales in NH mean temperatures is a property of the internal dynamics of the climate system.

Thermally activated building system (TABS) is a promising low-energy cooling technology, which provides better thermal comfort than the conventional air conditioning system. In TABS, cooled water circulated in the tubes embedded in one or any combination of roof, floor slab and walls, not only reduces the heat ingress but also cools the building. Integrating TABS with eco-friendly building materials like glass fibre reinforced gypsum (GFRG) could be an intertwining solution. A hybrid system that integrates TABS with GFRG roof is investigated in this study. The thermal behavior of this thermally activated glass fibre reinforced gypsum (TAGFRG) roof is analysed experimentally in terms of diurnal temperature gradients, thermal images of the interior and exterior roof surfaces, decrement factor and water temperature variations. The reinforcement zone of the TAGFRG roof handled a higher cooling load compared to that of air cavity zones. The diurnal temperature fluctuation of interior roof surface at the air cavity and reinforcement zones is reduced by 5.1 and 6.7 degrees C respectively by TAGFRG roof cooling. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Mean fecundity at 20degreesC was 157.6 eggs, and the oviposition period averaged 71.6 days. When nymphs were reared on strawberry, development of the European tarnished plant bug, Lygus rugulipennis, from egg lay to adult, ranged from 83.8 days at 15degreesC to 28.8 days at 25degreesC. Development times on groundsel were shorter and ranged from 65.6 to 22.2 days at 15degreesC and 25degreesC. Only two nymphs developed to adults at 10degreesC; no eggs hatched at that temperature. Mean fecundity at 20degreesC was 75.4 eggs, but ranged from 23 to 179. Under a fluctuating temperature regime of 10degreesC for 12 h:20degreesC for 12 h, nymphs of L. rugulipennis took 40.3 days to become adult on strawberry, and 33.4 days on groundsel. Simple linear models fitted the developmental rate - constant temperature relationship well for all species, accounting for 95-98% of the total variation in observed developmental rates. Development under fluctuating temperatures illustrated the potential problem of extrapolating linear models beyond the conditions of the experiment.",,,,,"Xu, Xiangming/I-3050-2014","Xu, Xiangming/0000-0002-4567-7117",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-4746,,,,,,2003,143,3,,,,,325,331,,10.1111/j.1744-7348.2003.tb00301.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2003.tb00301.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000186901200009,View Full Record in Web of Science

In each of twenty-six week-long experiments, the colonization by macroinvertebrates of boxes of natural sediment in a stony stream was measured. The experiments took place between February and November 1992 and environmental conditions prevailing during the weeks (particularly discharge and temperature) differed widely. 2. Colonization rate also varied widely between the weekly experiments and was sensitive to discharge, temperature and background benthic density, depending on the taxa considered. 3. A 'mobility index' measured colonization rate independently of background benthic density. This index was most strongly and positively correlated with discharge for the abundant stonefly Leuctra nigra, the net-spinning caddis Plectrocnemia conspersa and the Chironomidae, perhaps indicating that their mobility is physically driven by the influence of flow on drift. 4. Mobility in a second stonefly (Nemurella pictetii) was greatest in summer, when flows were low but temperature was high. Peak mobility in this species occurred during an ochreous bloom on the stream bed. It is likely the mobility of N, pictetii is more active than the other taxa. 5. There were thus differences among taxa in their mobility at baseflow and in their susceptibility to flow fluctuations. The population consequences of differences in mobility among taxa are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,AUG,1997,38,1,,,,,37,47,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00191.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00191.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XR47300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Atmospheric forcing data (precipitation, air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed, downward shortwave and longwave radiation) for a 20-year period (1979-1998) were provided to the 21 participating modeling groups for 218 1/4degrees grid cells that represented the study domain. The first decade (1979-1988) of the period was used for model spin-up. The quality of meteorologic forcing variables is of particular concern in high-latitude experiments and the quality of the gridded dataset was assessed to the extent possible. The lack of sub-daily precipitation, underestimation of true precipitation and the necessity to estimate incoming solar radiation were the primary data concerns for this study. The results from two of the three types of runs are analyzed in this, the first of a three-part paper: (1) calibration-validation runs-calibration of model parameters using observed streamflow was allowed for two small catchments (570 and 1300 km(2)), and parameters were then transferred to two other catchments of roughly similar size (2600 and 1500 km(2)) to assess the ability of models to represent ungauged areas elsewhere; and 2) reruns-using revised forcing data (to resolve problems with apparent underestimation of solar radiation of approximately 36%, and certain other problems with surface wind in the original forcing data). Model results for the period 1989-1998 are used to evaluate the performance of the participating land-surface schemes in a context that allows exploration of their ability to capture key processes spatially. In general, the experiment demonstrated that many of the LSSs are able to capture the limitations imposed on annual latent heat by the small net radiation available in this high-latitude environment. Simulated annual average net radiation varied between 16 and 40 W/m(2) for the 21 models, and latent heat varied between 18 and 36 W/m(2). Among-model differences in winter latent heat due to the treatment of aerodynamic resistance appear to be at least as important as those attributable to the treatment of canopy interception. In many models, the small annual net radiation forced negative sensible heat on average, which varied among the models between - 11 and 9 W/m(2). Even though the largest evaporation rates occur in the summer (June, July and August), model-predicted snow sublimation in winter has proportionately more influence on differences in annual runoff volume among the models. A calibration experiment for four small sub-catchments of the Torne-Kalix basin showed that model parameters that are typically adjusted during calibration, those that control storage of moisture in the soil column or on the land surface via ponding, influence the seasonal distribution of runoff, but have relatively little impact on annual runoff ratios. Similarly, there was no relationship between annual runoff ratios and the proportion of surface and subsurface discharge for the basin as a whole. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Soil nitrogen (N) cycling depends on the resistance and resilience of related microbial populations to DRW cycles, which could be closely related to soil nutrient status. However, the linkage of N-cycling microbial resistance and resil-ience and soil nutrient stoichiometry remains unknown in vegetable field. Here, we established four fertilization treat-ments in a four-year greenhouse vegetable field: no N fertilization, synthesized N fertilization, substituting 50% of chemical N with organic fertilizer or biofertilizer. Then, we set up an 85-day DRW-cycling incubation at 15, 25 and 35 degrees C including a 55-day fluctuating moisture for microbial resistance and then a 30-day constant moisture for micro-bial resilience. The results showed that microbial resistance was high (resistance index = 0.87- 0.99) in response to DRW cycles, but microbial resilience was generally low (resilience index = -0.36- 0.76), especially in 50% organic substitution or 15 degrees C. N-cycling microbes showed an important trade-off between their resistance and resilience to DRW cycles. Furthermore, most treatments showed microbial carbon limitation and N abundance during DRW cycles and recovered gradually to the undisturbed state. Microbial resistance was significantly related to the soil nutrient stoi-chiometry of carbon, N and phosphorus, while microbial resilience was mainly correlated with carbon-related indica-tors. In conclusion, N-cycling microbes presented good stability with oligotrophic strategy to frequent DRW cycles, which was linked to not only the historical legacy effect of DRW cycles but also soil nutrient stoichiometry in the vegetable field.",,,,,"shen, haojie/AHB-1979-2022","Changhua, Fan/0000-0001-5804-7694; Xu, Xintong/0000-0002-2261-7525; Zhang, Qianqian/0000-0001-7857-7713",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,MAY 10,2022,820,,,,,,,,153294,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153294,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153294,,,,,,,,35066034,,,,,WOS:000766803000018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The observed responses between the species to warming are consistent with predicted differential responses linked to genome size. 4.

One such interaction that may be altered under climate change is the ant-plant seed dispersal mutualism common in deciduous forests of eastern North America. As climatic warming alters the abundance and activity levels of ants, the potential exists for shifts in rates of ant-mediated seed dispersal. We used an experimental temperature manipulation at two sites in the eastern US (Harvard Forest in Massachusetts and Duke Forest in North Carolina) to examine the potential impacts of climatic warming on overall rates of seed dispersal (using Asarum canadense seeds) as well as species-specific rates of seed dispersal at the Duke Forest site. We also examined the relationship between ant critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and the mean seed removal temperature for each ant species. We found that seed removal rates did not change as a result of experimental warming at either study site, nor were there any changes in species-specific rates of seed dispersal. There was, however, a positive relationship between CTmax and mean seed removal temperature, whereby species with higher CTmax removed more seeds at hotter temperatures. The temperature at which seeds were removed was influenced by experimental warming as well as diurnal and day-to-day fluctuations in temperature. Taken together, our results suggest that while temperature may play a role in regulating seed removal by ants, ant plant seed-dispersalmutualisms may be more robust to climate change than currently assumed.",,,,,"Ribbons, Relena/B-5749-2015; Sanders, Nathan/ABE-4335-2020","Ribbons, Relena/0000-0002-9566-3813; Dunn, Robert/0000-0002-6030-4837",,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,MAR 11,2014,2,,,,,,,,e286,10.7717/peerj.286,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.286,,,,,,,,24688863,,,,,WOS:000347563200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we characterized the thermal sensitivity of larval developmental rates and survival in several Australian mainland populations of the dengue virus vector Aedes aegypti. Males developed more rapidly than females, but there were no differences among populations for development time or survival despite previously demonstrated genetic differentiation for neutral markers. Optimal development and survival temperatures were 37 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. The values for maximal development and survival were similar to standard functions used in the container inhabiting simulation (CIMSIM) model for predicting population dynamics of Ae. aegypti populations, but CIMSIM assumed a lower optimal temperature. Heat stress experiments indicated that larvae could withstand water temperatures up to 44 degrees C regardless of the rate at which temperature was increased. Results from development time measured under constant temperatures could predict development time under fluctuating conditions, whereas CIMSIM predicted faster rates of development.

Both effects may be important for the vast areas of global forests that fluctuate between periods when cool temperatures limit photosynthesis and periods when soil moisture may be limiting to carbon gain(4-6,9-11). Here we show that the effects of climate warming flip from positive to negative as southern boreal forests transition from rainy to modestly dry periods during the growing season. In a three-year open-air warming experiment with juveniles of 11 temperate and boreal tree species, an increase of 3.4 degrees C in temperature increased lightsaturated net photosynthesis and leaf diffusive conductance on average on the one-third of days with the wettest soils. In all 11 species, leaf diffusive conductance and, as a result, light-saturated net photosynthesis decreased during dry spells, and did so more sharply in warmed plants than in plants at ambient temperatures. Consequently, across the 11 species, warming reduced lightsaturated net photosynthesis on the two-thirds of days with driest soils. Thus, low soil moisture may reduce, or even reverse, the potential benefits of climate warming on photosynthesis in mesic, seasonally cold environments, both during drought and in regularly occurring, modestly dry periods during the growing season.",,,,,,"Stefanski, Artur/0000-0002-5412-1014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-0836,1476-4687,,,,OCT 11,2018,562,7726,,,,,263,+,,10.1038/s41586-018-0582-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0582-4,,,,,,,,30283137,,,,,WOS:000446920400052,View Full Record in Web of Science
