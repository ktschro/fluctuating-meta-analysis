A.; Peck, Lloyd S.",,,Antarctic intertidal limpet ecophysiology: A winter-summer comparison,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Antarctic intertidal zone is one of the world's most extreme marine environments. As well as having a typically high annual temperature variation (similar to 30 degrees C), it is affected by frequent ice scouring in summer and ice encasement in winter, as well as substantial salinity fluctuations during tidal cycles. For many years the Antarctic intertidal was believed to host only migratory species during summer, however, recent studies have found several permanently resident macrofaunal species, including the limpet Nacella concinna. Here we present results of the first seasonal comparison of different ecophysiological parameters in this species collected from the intertidal in both winter (August and September) and summer (January and February) on Adelaide Island (West Antarctic Peninsula). There was clear evidence of seasonal acclimatisation with a shift in thermal window between winter and summer limpets. The seasonal change in metabolic rate did not show increased costs in winter (cf metabolic cold adaptation) and the seasonal increase in oxygen consumption was within the range expected due to the physical effects of temperature alone. O:N ratios indicated that the animals were using the same metabolic substrate (mainly protein) all year round. There was no significant difference in condition factor between winter and early summer individuals. However comparisons with subtidal N. concinna showed that those from the intertidal had a lower condition factor than those permanently immersed. Whilst remaining in the ice-encased intertidal during winter may give access to ice-algae and microphytobenthos in the shallows and provide a feeding advantage early in the season, there are clearly extra costs to living in the intertidal per se. Hence N. concinna may not derive any obvious fitness advantage but may simply be occupying an available niche and surviving the physical challenges in the shallows. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Sensors for measuring both mean and fluctuating quantities were used, with the majority of them indigenously built. Soil temperature sensors up to a depth of 30 cm from the surface were among the variables connected to the mean data logger. A PC-based data acquisition system built at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IISc, was used to acquire the data from fast response sensors. This paper reports the various components of a typical MONTBLEX tower observatory and describes the actual experiments carried out in the surface layer at four sites over the monsoon trough region as a part of the MONTBLEX programme. It also describes and discusses several checks made on randomly selected tower data-sets acquired during the experiment. Checks made include visual inspection of time traces from various sensors, comparative plots of sensors measuring the same variable, wind and temperature profile plots calculation of roughness lengths, statistical and stability parameters, diurnal variation of stability parameters, and plots of probability density and energy spectrum for the different sensors.

Franco) is an important exotic tree species that was planted across a large part of Europe during the last century. In both experimental trials and conventional forest plantations, the trees grow at a high rate and produce high-quality timber. The present study investigated climate-growth relationships of Douglas-fir at two Italian sites that contrast in climate: a Mediterranean area in southern Italy (Mercurella site) and a cooler, moister site in the northern Apennines without summer aridity (Acquerino). The relationship between tree-ring chronologies and monthly climatic variables was evaluated by a moving average and correlation analysis. Results showed that the minimum temperature in February and in March play a key role for Douglas-fir at both sites, with a positive effect on growth. At the northern site, it is also highly sensitive to late summer temperatures (negative correlation) and spring-summer precipitation (positive correlation). Growth rates in southern latitudes were high even in Europe and in the Mediterranean environment, with low sensitivity to climatic fluctuation. On the basis of our results, further common garden experiments should test adaptation and the interaction between genetics and environment of second- or third-generation seeds from old stands across Europe such as done by the old International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) or the European Douglas-fir Improvement Research Cooperative (EUDIREC) experimentation programmes.",,,,,"Corona, Piermaria/G-1565-2011; Marchi, Maurizio/T-3813-2019; Vacchiano, Giorgio/C-4494-2008","Corona, Piermaria/0000-0002-8105-0792; Marchi, Maurizio/0000-0002-6134-1744; Vacchiano, Giorgio/0000-0001-8100-0659; castaldi, cristiano/0000-0003-1972-8416",,,,,,,,,,,,,1007-662X,1993-0607,,,,DEC,2020,31,6,,,,,2193,2204,,10.1007/s11676-019-01041-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11676-019-01041-5,,OCT 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000488902700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The silverleaf whitefly (Bemisia argentifolii, Bellows and Perring) is a major insect pest in tropical and subtropical regions where heat stress and desiccation pose formidable threats to survival. We found that sorbitol levels increased ten-fold when whiteflies were exposed to elevated temperatures. Sorbitol levels rose from 0.16 nmol whitefly(-1) at 25 degrees C to 1.59 nmol whitefly(-1) at 42 degrees C. Sorbitol levels fluctuated diurnally under glasshouse and field conditions increasing ten-fold from morning to early afternoon. Feeding experiments on artificial diets showed that both temperature and dietary sucrose concentration were key factors influencing sorbitol accumulation. Cell free extracts prepared from adult whiteflies catalyzed NADPH-dependent fructose reduction, but were unable to reduce glucose with either NADPH or NADH. Radiotracer experiments with labeled glucose and fructose showed that fructose was the immediate precursor of sorbitol. Thus, sorbitol synthesis in the whitefly is apparently unconventional, involving conversion of fructose by a novel NPLDPH-dependent ketose reductase. We propose that sorbitol accumulation is a mechanism for thermoprotection and osmoregulation in the silverleaf whitefly, allowing the insect to thrive in environments conducive to thermal and osmotic stress.

Objectives were to determine the virulence of several species and isolates of entomopathogenic nematodes at various soil moisture contents and temperatures, and after fluctuations in soil moisture. Studies included up to five isolates of entomopath ogenic nematodes: Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (Oswego and Tuscarora strains), Steinernema glaseri (Steiner) (NC1 strain), S. feltiae (Filipjev) (Biosys 369 strain), and S. carpocapsae (Weiser) (NY001 strain). Nematodes were applied to sandy loam soils ranging in soil moisture content from below the permanent wilting point of plants to near saturation. In all experiments, a rainfall or irrigation event was simulated by adding water to rehydrate soils to high moisture levels (near saturation). Nematode virulence was evaluated periodically by measuring insect mortality in Galleria mellonella (L.) larval bioassays, before and after rehydration. Nematode virulence increased with soil moisture content for all species and isolates tested. Our studies demonstrated that the virulence of entomopathogenic nematodes in low moisture conditions could be restored by rehydrating the soil. Insect mortality was generally low in low-moisture, nematode-infested soils before rehydration, but increased to high levels posthydration. Moisture effects were evident from the onset of each experiment, whereas the effect of soil temperature on nematode-induced insect mortality was delayed and nonsignificant until 14 wk after the initiation of the third experiment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,FEB,2003,32,1,,,,,80,87,,10.1603/0046-225X-32.1.80,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-32.1.80,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000181429900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present work, a hybrid K-Nearest Neighbor-Random Forest (KNN-RF) is used for the prediction of variations in groundwater levels (L) of an aquifer with the groundwater relatively close to the surface (<10 m) is proposed. First, the time-series smoothing methods are applied to improve the quality of groundwater data. Then, the ensemble K-Nearest Neighbor-Random Forest (KNN-RF) model is treated using hydro-climatic data for the prediction of variations in the levels of the groundwater tables up to three months ahead. Climatic and groundwater data collected from eastern Rwanda were used for validation of the model on a rolling window basis. Potential predictors were: the observed daily mean temperature (T), precipitation (P), and daily maximum solar radiation (S). Previous day's precipitation P (t - 1), solar radiation S (t), temperature T (t), and groundwater level L (t) showed the highest variation in the fluctuations of the groundwater tables. The KNN-RF model presents its results in an intelligible manner.

Three ponds were fertilized with inorganic N and P (experimental) and three ponds were fertilized with a combination of organic chopped hay, soybean meal, alfalfa meal, and inorganic N and P (control). Daily dissolved oxygen (DO) changes were monitored at three depths. Chlorophyll a concentrations and Secchi depth measurements were taken twice per week. Mean DO concentrations were significantly lower (P < 0.0001, n = 684) in the control ponds. Average productivity, calculated by either dawn-dusk-dawn DO changes, or diel DO changes measured at 15-min intervals, were not significantly different between the treatments (P>0.05) however, chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly higher in control ponds (19.21 vs. 7.09 mug/l in experimental ponds). Secchi depth did not correlate with algal productivity or biomass. Higher alkalinity did not increase algal production or biomass. Even with cooler than normal temperatures, one of the control ponds required aeration to avoid a fish kill. Overall, fish yield and survival were higher in control ponds, suggesting that some other factors associated with organic fertilizers (increased protozoan production, slower release of nutrients) may make them necessary for optimum yields. Adjusting the ratio of organic to inorganic fertilizer could reduce cost and anoxia without reducing fish production. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The highest daily release of eggs was typically found from 18:00 to 22:00 h. Dehydration was not found to influence the pattern of egg release and in the field no correlation was found with temperature or water level fluctuations. An endogenous clock in F. vesiculosus is suggested and different entraining factors presented and discussed. We further suggest that the observed rhythmicity is of great adaptive value for coordination of gamete release in a dioecious species like F. vesiculosus in the atidal environment of the Baltic Sea, where this species occurs almost always submerged. Ecologically, the cyclic gamete release means that reproduction and recruitment are reduced to a few occasions during the reproductive period, which was earlier assumed to be several months long.

Here, we have sequenced the internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA (ITS-rDNA) of Symbiodinium from samples of designated Zoanthus sansibaricus Carlgren (Anthozoa: Hexacorallia) colonies collected for 12 months (August 2004-July 2005) at a high latitude non-reefal coral community at Sakurajima, Kagoshima Bay, Japan (31 degrees 35'N, 130 degrees 35'E). Our results show that despite large ocean temperature changes (15.0-29.0 degrees C) throughout the one-year experimental period, Z. sansibaricus colonies contained only clade C Symbiodinium from many different subclade C1/C3-related novel types not previously reported. While no temporal changes in clade-level associations were seen, there were consistent and extremely large amounts (145 unique sequences out of 153 total obtained sequences) of genotypic microvariation observed in our obtained sequences. Despite Z. sansibaricus acquiring Symbiodinium horizontally and the presence of various other Symbiodinium clades (A, G) and subclades (e.g. C15 and derived subclades) in the immediate environment, Z. sansibaricus at Sakurajima specifically associates with subclade C1/C3-related Symbiodinium. While subclades C1/C3 have been found in a variety of different environments and are believed to be ancestral, 'generalist' types of Symbiodinium, C1/C3-related clades such as seen here may be more adapted to specialized niches.

Surprisingly, the sturgeon showed the highest CPCA activity as well, whereas its APCA results were rather modest. Despite the divergent temperature preferences of the other two species, they both exhibited an increase in all parameters of interest in summer to winter direction.

LES accurately predicted both the time-averaged velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. For the concentration field, RANS model predicted the region of high time-averaged concentration near the exhaust port but overestimated ground-level values. Meanwhile, LES adequately predicted time-averaged and fluctuating concentrations.

During the experimental period from July 2006 through April 2007, 2 years after initiation of the treatments, microbial biomass C in the humus layer did not vary with seasonal changes in soil temperature or water content.

Mineral soil microbial C correlated with following-month plant litterfall in control plots, but these correlations were not observed in root-trenching plots or girdling plots.

We used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to quantify changes in bacterial richness and phylogenetic diversity, and identified operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that became overrepresented or suppressed as a consequence of Bd infection. During the warm-wet season, frogs limited Bd infections, recruited putatively beneficial bacteria and returned to pre-infection levels of richness and phylogenetic diversity.

Most studies focus on extensive green roofs, with inadequate assessment of the complex intensive type, subtropical region, and thermal insulation effect. This study examines the physical properties, biological processes, and thermal insulation performance of an intensive green roof through four seasons. An experimental woodland installed on a Hong Kong building rooftop was equipped with environmental sensors to monitor microclimatic and soil parameters. The excellent thermal performance of the intensive green roof is verified. Even though our site has a 100 cm thick soil to support tree growth, we found that a thin soil layer of 10 cm is sufficient to reduce heat penetration into building. Seasonal weather variations notably control transpiration and associated cooling effect. The tree canopy reduces solar radiation reaching the soil surface, but the trapped air increases air temperature near the soil surface. The substrate operates an effective heat sink to dampen temperature fluctuations. In winter, the subtropical green roof triggers notable heat loss from the substrate into the ambient air, and draws heat upwards from warmer indoor air to increase energy consumption to warm indoor air. This finding deviates from temperate latitude studies. The results offer hints to optimize the design and thermal performance of intensive green roofs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Populations at species' range margins may be especially crucial in containing a gene pool comprising adaptations to extreme climatic conditions. Many species of northern European bog ecosystems reach their southern lowland range limit in central Europe. In a common-garden experiment, we experimentally assessed the impact of projected climatic changes on five bog-plant species (including peat moss Sphagnum magellanicum) sampled along a latitudinal gradient of 1400km from Scandinavia to the marginal lowland populations in Germany. Populations were cultivated in monocultures and in experimental communities composed of all five species from their local community, and exposed to five combinations of three climate treatments (warming, fluctuating water-tables, fertilization) in a southern common garden. Whereas most monocultures showed a decreasing biomass production from southern to northern origins under southern environmental conditions, in the experimental mixed-species communities, an increasing biomass production towards northern communities was observed together with a shift in interspecific interactions along the latitudinal gradient. While negative dominance effects prevailed in southern communities, higher net biodiversity effects were observed in northern subarctic communities. The combined effects of climate treatments increased biomass production in monocultures of most origins. In communities, however, overall the treatments did not result in significantly changed biomass production. Among individual treatments, water-table fluctuations caused a significant decrease in biomass production, but only in southern communities, indicating higher vulnerability to changed climatic conditions. Here, negative effects of climate treatments on graminoids were not compensated by the slightly increased growth of peat moss that benefited from interspecific interactions only in northern communities.Synthesis. We conclude that shifting interactions within multispecies communities caused pronounced responses to changed climatic conditions in wetland communities of temperate southern marginal, but not of northern subarctic origin. Therefore, future models investigating the impacts of climate change on plant communities should consider geographical variation in species interactions an important factor influencing community responses to changed climatic conditions.",,,,,"Heinken, Thilo/GRS-3133-2022","Joshi, Jasmin/0000-0002-4210-2465",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,NOV,2013,101,6,,,,,1484,1497,,10.1111/1365-2745.12158,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12158,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000325984300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present paper, yield of winter wheat over 50 years of FYM, N, P and K fertilizer application (12 treatments altogether) was analyzed in the Ivanovice Crop Rotation Experiment (ICRE), established in 1955 on a degraded black earth soil (chernozem). The ICRE is located in a warm (8.4 degrees C mean annual temperature) and moderately dry (556 mm mean annual precipitation) sugar beet cropping area. Summarizing 50 years' results, variety had the largest effect on grain yield followed by the effect of mineral fertilizers, the preceding crop and farmyard manure application. The highest increase in grain yields was recorded after the introduction of short-straw varieties. High year-to-year variability in grain yields was recorded and some fluctuations were consistent with oscillations in the whole Czech Republic. Despite the high fertility of black earth soils in the locality, the mean grain yield in the ICRE was lower than the mean annual yield in the Czech Republic in five cases out of 50 years. The effect of fertilizer treatment on the grain yield was not significant in the first decade (the mean grain yields ranged from 3.4 to 3.8 t ha(-1)), but was significant in the fifth decade of the experiment (the mean grain yields ranged from 4.2 in control to 6.6 t ha(-1) in N121P89K102 treatment, respectively). Calculated by linear regression, the annual yield increased by 45.9-89.6 kg of grain per ha. The mean yield per I kg of applied N ha(-1) increased by 18.7 kg of grain in the fifth decade of the experiment. In unfertilized soil, the concentration of plant-available P, K and Mg was still optimal for winter wheat production even after 50 years without any fertilizer input. The black earth soils in the locality clearly demonstrates a high and long-term stable natural fertility. The results from the ICRE stress the necessity for long-term research in grain yield analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These substeps originate from the F-1 rotation but with heavy load on the gamma shaft due to fluorescent labeling and the photophysical limitation of an optical microscope, which hampers better understanding of the intrinsic kinetic behavior of ATP hydrolysis. In this work, we present a method capable of electrically monitoring ATP hydrolysis of a single label-free F-1 in real time by using a high-gain silicon nanowire-based field-effect transistor circuit.

However, metabolic activity of whole communities, integrating the main interactions that occur in these assemblages, still needs to be investigated more deeply, especially when communities are emerged. Thus, the metabolism of the mid-intertidal Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus serratus communities was surveyed once a month throughout a year in the Bay of Morlaix (France). In situ measurements of primary production and respiration were taken at the onset of emersion periods, using benthic chambers coupled to CO2 infrared gas analyzers. Benthic measurements were taken successively on whole communities and after canopy removal, to assess the contribution of the canopies to the communities' carbon fluxes. Concurrently, nitrogen and organic carbon contents of the two Fucus species were evaluated monthly. Both communities exhibited high metabolic activity year-round (community gross primary production: 400-1000 mgC m(-2) h(-1); community respiration: 100-500 mgC m(-2) h(-1)), with canopies accounting for 77-97 % of the global CO2 fluxes. However, this relative canopies' contribution to global CO2 fluxes did not follow seasonal fluctuations, whereas both metabolic activities and nitrogen and carbon contents did, confirming the importance of light and temperature in the regulation of metabolic processes. A nutrient limitation was also suggested to occur in summer, when seawater was nutrient-depleted. Finally, the F. vesiculosus community, located upper on the shore, exhibited lower photosynthetic activity than the F. serratus community, being consistent with the vertical zonation rules of intertidal habitats.",,,,,"Davoult, dominique/D-5932-2012","Davoult, dominique/0000-0001-8678-3998",,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,OCT,2015,162,10,,,,,2119,2129,,10.1007/s00227-015-2741-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-015-2741-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000362322200016,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this research, treatment performance of piggery waste in an ectopic fermentation system (EFS) using different padding materials and safety evaluation of generated organic fertilizer were studied in a pilot experiment. RESULTS During the whole fermentation process, temperature in the EFS fluctuated with addition of fresh feces and its consumption, and the pH value varied between 6.5 and 9.5. The absorption coefficient of pig breeding wastewater and feces per kilogram of padding (maize straw) at the end was 2.52 and 1.88, respectively. Bacteria played a major role in decomposing organic matter, and its number was basically maintained at 10(7)-10(8) orders of magnitude. The C:N ratio in two EFS beds decreased gradually and was below 14:1 at the end, indicating the maturity of fermentation. Moreover, operation of the EFS with addition of rice husk/coconut shell mixture was more stable than that of EFS with maize straw. After fermentation, the heavy metal, total nutrient content, ascaris egg mortality and fecal coliform population of the generated organic fertilizer from two fermentation beds all met the limits of the Organic Fertilizer Standard of China, and the seed germination index of the product increased. CONCLUSIONS EFS employing maize straw or rice husk/coconut shell mixture as padding material can be used to treat both solid and liquid waste from pig farms.

We performed a cross experiment study where reproduction of females mated to males from the past, present, or future was monitored until death. In agreement with a model of fluctuating selection, we found that females survived better and had longer interbrood intervals when mated with their contemporary males compared to when mated with males from the future or the past. However, female weekly and lifetime reproductive successes displayed no differences between contemporary and noncontemporary matings. Finally, the coevolutionary patterns (arms race dynamics or fluctuating selection dynamics) possibly acting on female relative fitness could not be discriminated.

The observations suggest that properties vary differently in each of three different regions along the coast: the Southern California Eight which remains sheltered from strong wind forcing throughout the year; the central and northern California coast up to Cape Mendocino, the site of persistent equatorward winds; and the Oregon-Washington coast, where traveling cyclones and anticyclones produce vigorous and variable forcing. Over most of the region the variance in the wind speed is roughly equally divided between the annual cycle and the synoptic forcing, corresponding to periods between 5 and 50 cycles per year. Two seasons, summer and winter, are sufficient to describe the annual cycle. During the summer, two distinct wind speed maxima occur along the coast, one near Point Conception and the other off northern California, between Point Reyes and Point Arena. In the winter a single maximum occurs, located near Point Conception. The atmospheric pressure generally increases with latitude along the coast, but the annual cycle of atmospheric pressure has a different phase, depending on location; off the coast of California, highest pressures are found during the winter, while off Oregon and Washington, the highest pressures occur during the summer. Fluctuations in air and sea temperature are highly correlated, and the sea temperature is usually higher than the air temperature, in the winter. Examination of vertical soundings of the atmosphere at Oakland, Vandenberg Air Force Base and San Diego during the same period of time reveals that a well-defined inversion separates the marine boundary layer (MBL) from the free atmosphere above nearly 90% of the time during the summer and half the time during the winter. Station soundings consistently overestimate the MBL thickness, but the results do suggest that the MBL is supercritical part of the time in the vicinity of the three sites. An attempt is made to examine the interannual variability and compare it to the Southern Oscillation index, although the results are limited because the record length is short compared with interannual timescales. Spatially averaged temperature anomalies increase during winter 1982-1983, coincident with the large El Nino event.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,AUG 15,1995,100,C8,,,,,16029,16044,,10.1029/95JC00964,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95JC00964,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995RP99900016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although seed survival in soil generally increases with an increase in burial depth, whether the effects of burial on seed survival are comparable across different sites is unclear. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that the positive effects of burial on seed survival decrease as vegetation develops through succession. Four wetland species, Drosera rotundifolia, Lobelia sessilifolia, Rhynchospora alba and Moliniopsis japonica, were used for the study. The four species differ in their light requirement for germination; i.e., D. rotundifolia, L. sessilifolia and R. alba germinate best in light, whereas M. japonica germinates equally well in light and darkness. The seeds of these species were buried for two years at three depths (litter, 0 and 4 cm) in three successional stages with different amounts of vegetation and litter in a post-mined peatland. The photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and temperature at each of litter layer, 0 cm and 4 cm depths were measured for each successional stage. The between-depth differences in PAR and temperature fluctuations decreased as succession progressed. For the three light demanding species, burial promoted seed survival more in the initial successional stage than in the later successional stages, whereas for M. japonica, burial promoted seed survival equally in all successional stages. This study revealed significant variation in the effects of burial on seed survival, particularly for light-sensitive seeds, and that the soil surface layers in vegetated sites can contain persistent seeds, which could be used as a seed source in restoration.

The results showed that dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and pH in traditional aquaculture ponds were highly susceptible to meteorological changes. Changes in atmospheric temperature and relative humidity preceded changes in water parameters by about one hour, making them potential meteorological indicators for anticipating changes in the aquaculture ponds. Furthermore, we found that changes in dissolved oxygen preceded changes in pH, both of which preceded the water temperature. Considering that water parameters in traditional aquaculture are prone to abrupt changes, the yield of P. clarkii may be affected by repeated drastic and short-term fluctuations in water parameters.

In this study, we investigated how changes in leaf area index (LAI) and climatic variability alter long-term trends and seasonal variability of evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and soil moisture (SM) over the conterminous United States (CONUS) during the period 1983-2009 by using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with transient remotely-sensed LAI inputs. Factor-controlled simulation experiments reveal that while precipitation is the dominant factor controlling long-term trends and inter-annual fluctuations of water fluxes, other factors (temperature, LAI, and atmospheric CO2) make significant contributions to long-term trends, particularly over specific regions. Changes in LAI result in minor overall contributions to the inter -annual variability of ET, R, and SM over the CONUS as a whole; however, they do make a more significant contribution over certain regions, such as the Midwest. Furthermore, changing LAI is the second most important factor in controlling variability in ET and SM, particularly over the cool season.

Adult flies were monitored using Jackson and McPhail traps from November to May over a period of 3 yr. In January-March, absolute minimum and maximum air temperatures were 1-4.5 and 19-26 degreesC, respectively, whereas the average monthly minima and maxima were 6.2-9.7 degreesC and 15.4-18.5 degreesC, respectively. Adults were found at every inspection period (every second week) in at least one of the trapping systems used or the years of the study. Until the beginning of April developed eggs and sperm were found in >70% of females trapped. From mid-April until mid-May, 20-70% of females were fecund and fertile. This increased at the end of May- beginning of June to high percentages, >80%. Females survived in cages in the field an average of 4 mo in winter-spring, with some females surviving 5-6 mo. Infested 'Navel', 'Valencia' oranges, or bitter oranges could be found throughout the experimental period in all 3 yr and live eggs were always detected in infested fruits. Grown larvae were found in relatively high percentages of infested fruits until March, especially in bitter oranges, which appear to be a preferred host (up to 25 pupae per infested fruit). In April-May, grown larvae were seldom detected. In winter, larval development from the time of fruit sampling until larval exit often took 1.5-2 mo. The duration of the pupal stage under field temperatures was approximate to 2 mo for those pupae formed between December and February. This was reduced progressively to 10-20 d for those pupae formed in May. The mortality of young larvae (still near the oviposition hole) was between 40 and 70% from November until May, whereas adult emergence from pupae kept in the field fluctuated between 20 and 80%.

The increase in P, decline in N and decrease in the TN/TP mass ratio in the epilimnion of Lake Knneret during 1969-2004 created N limitation. An increase in C and decline in TN, with a consequential increase in the C/TN ratio were documented. TP was augmented but the C/TP ratio was only slightly increased.

Improperly timed reapplications will reduce the benefits of TE, but knowing when to reapply is difficult because suppression duration is affected by environmental conditions, especially temperature. In another experiment we determined that GDD with a base temperature of 0 degrees C (GDD(0)) was the most precise unit for predicting the maximum suppression point (MSP) after a TE application on a 'MiniVerde' ultradwarf bermudagrass putting green. The model suggested that the MSP occurred at 262 GDD(0) after the TE application. The objective of this second experiment was to test GDD(0) reapplication intervals for an extended period of time. We included four GDD(0) intervals (100, 200, 400, and 600) and two TE rates (0.022 and 0.044 kg a.i. ha(-1)). We hypothesized that reapplying TE before the MSP would result in a consistent suppression magnitude from day to day (i.e., consistent daily growth), which should be an ideal growth pattern for turfgrass managers. The 100- and 200-GDD(0) intervals yielded consistent suppression magnitude throughout the experiment, and suppression magnitude increased with the higher TE rate. In contrast, the 400- and 600-GDD(0) intervals allowed fluctuation in suppression magnitude from day to day.

The warm and cold water masses in the vicinity of the Kuroshio axis from winter to early spring used to be critical for the recruitment in the high-stock period, because most of the larvae were distributed there. However, the environmental fluctuation might not affect the recruitment in the low-stock period. Some studies reported that spawning location and spawning season, and hence the larval habitat, differ depending on the stock level. Three points were investigated in this study: (a) how spawning location and spawning season shifted from the late 1990s, (b) confirmation of the distribution area of larvae in the recent low-stock period and (c) whether the water temperature in the vicinity of the Kuroshio axis was still related to the recruitment in the low-stock period. The spawning location and spawning season clearly changed after 1995. Consequently, particle tracking experiments suggested that the larvae appeared in the vicinity of the Kuroshio axis from winter to early spring decreased. Nevertheless, only the ambient temperature of larvae that appeared in the vicinity of the Kuroshio axis from winter had a significant negative correlation with an index of the recruitment in the low-stock period.

The fallow period managements were bare soil or soil sown with a cover crop after maize harvest. For each year, topsoil temperature (0-20 cm-depth) was lower under conservation tillage systems at sowing, from 0.8 to 2.8 degrees C. This difference persisted several weeks after sowing, and disappeared afterwards.

Also, microenvironments were simulated in the laboratory to determine the possible components (temperature, temperature fluctuation, and moisture) involved in physical dormancy release. The laboratory work indicated that wet heat is an important dormancy release mechanism for both populations; and dry heat for one of them, but showed no effects on the other one. Consistent with that, burial experiment showed seeds of two populations had two contrasting-dormancy release patterns in the field. Most seeds of the dry heat sensitive population released dormancy but the other one remained dormant when seeds placed on the soil surface for 11 months (where seeds were exposed to dry heat but not wet heat). The difference of physical dormancy release pattern response to burial depth and simulated condition may attribute to seed coat color and hilum thickness which showed significantly different between two populations.

Model results are compared with in situ currents, high-frequency radar-derived surface currents, and hydrographic measurements obtained from an array of moored instruments and field surveys. The correlations between observed and modeled alongshore currents and temperatures in water depths of 50 m are in excess of 0.8. A study designed to test the model's sensitivity to different initial stratification, surface forcing, domain size, and river forcing demonstrates that surface heating is important, and that the model results are sensitive to initial stratification. An objective criterion for assessing the skill of a model simulation relative to a control simulation is outlined, providing an objective means for identifying the best model simulation. The model-data comparisons demonstrate that temperature fluctuations off Newport are primarily in response to surface heating and that subsurface density fluctuations are controlled by the wind-forced circulation through salinity. Experiments with river forcing indicate that, in the vicinity of Newport, the Columbia River plume is typically greater than 15 km from the coast and is confined to the top few meters of the water column.

To investigate the stress resistance in the first and second year of development, a steady-state drought experiment was implemented. Photosynthesis (A(net)), stomatal conductance and transpiration (E) were measured on three different sampling dates together with phloem soluble sugars, amino acids and non-structural proteins. Needle ascorbic acid (AsA) and reactive oxygen species were measured to evaluate the seedlings' drought stress condition in the final sampling. Drought impaired A(net) and E by 35 and 31%, respectively, and increased AsA levels up to 10-fold, without significant impact on the phloem metabolites. Phloem sugars related to temperature fluctuations rather than soil moisture and did not relate closely to A(net) levels. Sugars and proteins decreased between the second and third sampling date by 56 and 61%, respectively, and the ratio of sugars to amino acids decreased between the first and third sampling by 81%, while A(net) and water-use efficiency (A(net)/E) decreased only in the older seedlings. Although gas exchange was higher in the older seedlings, ascorbic acid and phloem metabolites were higher in the younger seedlings. It was concluded that the drought stress responses depended significantly on developmental stage, and research on the physiology of Aleppo pine regeneration should focus more on temperature conditions and the duration of drought than its severity.",,,,,"Alexou, Maria/AAP-6102-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,OCT,2013,33,10,,,,,1030,1042,,10.1093/treephys/tpt084,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpt084,,,,,,,,24200584,,,,,WOS:000327460000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The interaction between the dissociated ligand and the protein environment is described by the recently developed fluctuating three-point charge model for the CO molecule. Umbrella sampling along trajectories, previously found to sample the binding site (13) and the Xe4 pocket, is used to construct free-energy profiles for the ligand escape. On the basis of the Smoluchowski equation, the relaxation of different initial population distributions is followed in space and time. For native Mb at room temperature, the calculated rebinding times are in good agreement with experimental values and give an inner barrier of 4.3 kcal/mol between the docking site B (Mb(...)CO) and the A state (bound MbCO), compared to an effective barrier, H-eff, of 4.5 kcal/mol and barriers into the majority conformation A(1) and the minority conformation A(3) of 2.4 and 4.3 kcal/mol, respectively. In the case of the L29F mutant, the free-energy surface is flatter and the dynamics is much more rapid. As was found in experiment, escape to the Xe4 pocket is facile for L29F whereas, for native Mb, the barriers to this site are larger.

Environments compared were standard confinement (CON) and deep-bedded semi-outdoor systems. The deep-bedded method employed in the. current study was the use of hoop structures. Hoops are large, tent-like shelters with cornstalks or straw for bedding-Gilts ranging in weight from 59 to 71 kg were randomly assigned to treatments of Hoop (n = 50) and CON (n = 18) environments. Gilts were fed a two-phase dietary sequence, ad libitum for 45 days. Six gilts per treatment were selected for carcass composition and quality evaluation. The experiment was replicated a total of five times. Pigs raised in the Hoop environment gained significantly less and required significantly more feed for growth than pigs raised in the CON environment. Carcasses from CON-finished pigs were significantly fatter at the 10th rib, which lowered carcass percentage fat-free lean(FFL) and they also had greater loin marbling scores compared with carcasses from Hoop-finished pigs (P < 0.05). Significant replication effects were noted on beginning weight, live weight, carcass weight, percentage FFL, backtat, lipid content and adipose firmness. Carcasses from Hoop pigs had lower proportions of palmitic acid (P < 0.05), and higher proportions of oleic and linoleic acid (P < 0.05) in the inner layer of adipose tissue. The proportion of saturated fatty acid was lower, and that of mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acid was higher in the inner layer of the adipose tissue of Hoop pigs. Variations in fatty acid composition and lipid deposition may have been caused by environmental temperature, since decreases in environmental temperature accompanied compositional variation of the adipose, leading to higher proportions of monounsaturated fatty acid and lower proportions of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid in adipose tissue, regardless of treatment. Volatile profile analysis revealed that adipose tissue of Hoop pigs had significantly higher amounts of 3-butanal and heptanal compared with CON pigs, which may be related to the amount of oleic and linoleic acids composing the adipose tissue. These data indicate finishing pigs in hoop structures allows for exposure to fluctuating temperatures, which may influence the growth of pigs, as well as fatty acid composition and firmness of pork products.",,,,,"Huff-Lonergan, Elisabeth/C-7557-2009; Lonergan, Steven M/O-6233-2016","Huff-Lonergan, Elisabeth/0000-0001-5012-3277; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1751-7311,1751-732X,,,,MAR,2008,2,3,,,,,459,470,,10.1017/S1751731107001292,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1751731107001292,,,,,,,,22445049,,,,,WOS:000253609900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Life history parameter values incorporated into the model were estimated by laboratory rearing experiments. To validate the present model, the development of eggs laid monthly from June I through November I was simulated under dynamic temperature and photoperiod conditions at Ayabe City. The individuals laid on June I did not enter diapause but emerged in early August of the same year. On the other hand, about 2/3 of the individuals laid on July 1, and all those laid on August I and September I entered diapause (or quiescence), and started to emerge in late May of the following year. Individuals laid on October I and November I overwintered as young larvae (1st-3rd stadia) and eggs, respectively, and the majority of these emerged in late July-early August. Interestingly, the remaining individuals entered diapause in the 2nd year and emerged in June of the 3rd year. Analyses of these simulation results suggested that concentrated emergence of P hilaris can occur twice in one year (in late May-early June and in late July-early August) at Ayabe, and this is fairly concordant with known adult prevalence at this location considering the long life-span of adults. It was also suggested that although P hilaris at Ayabe has basically a univoltine life cycle with a facultative diapause, varying proportions of the population appear to have a bivoltine life cycle or a semivoltine life cycle depending on the meteorological conditions of that year.

These interactive stressors fluctuate predictably and seasonally over historical periods, which has facilitated the evolution of wide environmental tolerance in some estuarine inhabitants. However, physiological and behavioral acclimatization is seasonally based for many estuarine species, meaning that a shift in the unpredictability of climate events and trends will disrupt the effectiveness of evolved tolerance mechanisms. Of particular concern are extreme cold events and high-volume precipitation events, which will acutely and unpredictably alter an estuarine habitat. The eelgrass sea hare, Phyllaplysia taylori, has documented euryhaline and eurythermal tolerance to summer conditions, but the winter environment may pose a greater challenge to seasonally relevant acclimatization scenarios. Here, we characterized lower critical thermal limits, and behavioral responses to stimuli leading up to these limits, in two central California P. taylori populations under four temperature-salinity scenarios in a laboratory acclimation experiment. Acclimation to warmer conditions significantly increased critical thermal minima, while fresher conditions resulted in high mortality. However, the surviving individuals in the fresher conditions were able to respond to stimuli more quickly overall, despite their shortest response time being at a higher temperature than the saltier-acclimated individuals. Within the environmental context of their natural habitats, we find that acclimation to climate change-induced warming will hinder sea hares' ability to weather existing and future cold extremes and precipitation events.",,,,,,"McAlpine-Bellis, Elizabeth Anne/0000-0003-1927-6907",,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,NOV,2021,61,5,,,,,1741,1752,,10.1093/icb/icab087,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icab087,,MAY 2021,,,,,,33999175,,,,,WOS:000736126200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The initial wet body weight of shrimp was 2.74 +/- 0.00 g (mean +/- S.E.). After a 45-day experiment, the weight gain (WG) and the specific growth rate (SGR(d)) of shrimps in FL3 treatment were significantly higher than those in other treatments (P<0.05), which might be caused by high feed intake (FId) and food conversion efficiency (FCEd). Another reason for the better growth in FL3 was that the energy allocation for respiration was lowest and the energy allocation for growth was highest These results suggest that suitable fluctuation of light intensity could promote the growth of L. vannamei. There was no significant difference in molting frequency (MF) between constant light intensity and four fluctuating light intensity treatments (P>0.05). The value of crude lipid in FL1-4 treatments decreased compared with that in the constant light intensity treatment, because of the effect of the fluctuating light intensity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

At most times during the selected period there are large wavelike protrusions along the current. During at least three separate periods these appear as a set of three or four roughly equally spaced meanders, or wave crests. Each meander diverts the warm water far offshore of the shelf break, where the core of the southward current is otherwise normally found. Their amplitude generally grows in time, and the anticyclonic motions in the meanders are usually accompanied by cool cyclonic circulations between the meanders. Large meanders are more than 200 km across. Although the flow is unsteady and fronts sometimes translate at speeds of up to 0.8 m s-1, the meanders do not move along the coast and can be followed through the images for 30 to 60 days. These features represent very major diversions to the southward flow in the Leeuwin Current and result in large fluctuations in local current velocity and sea surface temperature. On this scale, the structure of the flow has many features in common with that observed in laboratory experiments with coastal currents driven by steady thermal forcing. Smaller billow structures are also apparent along the strongest temperature fronts in the satellite images.",,,,,"griffiths, ross w/E-6121-2010","griffiths, ross w/0000-0002-5291-1178",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,SEP 15,1991,96,C9,,,,,16739,16757,,10.1029/91JC01712,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JC01712,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GG23900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The proposed strategy utilized rotational random walks to reorient the micro-swimmer and turned on its propulsion only when the swimmer was aligned with the target location (adaptive control). A Langevin-type equation of motion was formulated, integrating these two ideas to describe the dynamics of the stochastically controlled swimmer. The strategy was examined using computer simulations and illustrated in a proof-of-principle experiment steering a gold-coated Janus micro-sphere moving in three dimensions. The physical parameters relevant to the two actuating forces under the experimental conditions were investigated theoretically and experimentally, revealing that a similar to 7 K temperature differential on the micro-swimmer surface could generate a propelling photophoretic strength of similar to 0.1 pN. The controllability and positioning error were discussed using both experimental data and Langevin dynamics simulations, where the latter was further used to identify two key unitless control parameters for manipulation accuracy and efficiency; they were the number of random-walk turns the swimmer experienced on the experimental timescale (the revolution number) and the photon-nudge distance within the rotational diffusion time (the propulsion number).

The frequency of this radiometer is 31.65 GHz. For the antenna elevation angle, one is 30 degrees and the other is 90 degrees. In order to detect the signals with low effective noise temperature (<10K) from the LWC, the noise coupling technique is used. Through injecting constant equal noise signal into the two antenna ports respectively, the technique can elevate the small input noise signal power to the detectable range of the square-law detector and thus realize the weak signal detection. Moreover, in order to eliminate the impacts of the system gain fluctuations and obtain a higher sensitivity, an auto-gain compensation method based on the analog-to-digital converter, microcontroller and host computer software techniques is also proposed. Compared with the traditional radiometers, the radiometer topology is greatly simplified and the gain fluctuations can be readily real-time compensated using the compensation method. The laboratory test results show that radiometric sensitivity is better than 0.2 K for 300ms integration time and the instrument is conforming to specifications.

M.",,,Short-Term Summer Inundation as a Measure to Counteract Acidification in Rich Fens,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,,"In regions with intensive agriculture, water level fluctuation in wetlands has generally become constricted within narrow limits. Water authorities are, however, considering the re-establishment of fluctuating water levels as a management tool in biodiverse, base-rich fens ('rich fens'). This includes temporary inundation with surface water from ditches, which may play an important role in counteracting acidification in order to conserve and restore biodiversity. Inundation may result in an increased acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) for two reasons: infiltration of base-rich inundation water into peat soils, and microbial alkalinity generation under anaerobic conditions. The main objectives of this study were to test whether short-term (2 weeks) summer inundation is more effective than short-term winter inundation to restore the ANC in the upper 10 cm of non-floating peat soils, and to explain potential differences. Large-scale field experiments were conducted for five years in baserich fens and Sphagnum-dominated poor fens. Winter inundation did not result in increased porewater ANC, because infiltration was inhibited in the waterlogged peat and evapotranspiration rates were relatively low. Also, low temperatures limit microbial alkalinity generation. In summer, however, when temperature and evapotranspiration rates are higher, inundation resulted in increased porewater Ca and HCO3- concentrations, but only in areas with characteristic rich fen bryophytes. This increase was not only due to stronger infiltration into the soil, but also to higher microbial alkalinity generation under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, porewater ANC did not increase in Sphagnum-plots as a result of the ability of Sphagnum spp. to acidify their environment. In both rich and poor fens, flooding-induced P-mobilization remained sufficiently low to safeguard P-limited vegetation. NO3- and NH4+ dynamics showed no considerable changes either. In conclusion, short-term summer inundation with base-rich and nutrient-poor surface water is considered beneficial in the management of non-floating rich fens, and much more effective than winter inundation.",,,,,"Kooijman, Annemieke/S-5762-2016; Lamers, Leon P.M./A-8718-2012","Lamers, Leon P.M./0000-0003-3769-2154; Mettrop, Ivan/0000-0001-7143-9086",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,DEC 4,2015,10,12,,,,,,,e0144006,10.1371/journal.pone.0144006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144006,,,,,,,,26637121,,,,,WOS:000366143800036,View Full Record in Web of Science

Continuous exposure to salinities between 28 and 37 psu did not affect the duration of larval development.

Experiments were completed by endoscopic observation of the insects in the visible and the near infrared range and by acoustical monitoring and subsequent frequency analysis of various locomotor activities. Direct calorimetric results of this paper are compared with data of indirect calorimetry from the literature using a respiratory quotient of 1.00 and 21.13 J consumed. Agreements between both methods are generally good. The results show that weight-specific heat production rates increase with age of worker bees by a factor of 5.6 at 30-degrees-C, 3.7 at 25-degrees-C and 40.0 at 20-degrees-C. In groups of foragers the heat production decreases with growing group size to around 6% of the value for an isolated bee. The presence of a fertile queen or of brood reduces the heat output of a small worker group significantly. Adult drones exhibit a much higher metabolic rate (up to 19.7-fold at 20-degrees-C) than juveniles with strong fluctuations in the power-time curves. Fertile queens show a less pronounced heat production rate than virgin queens (54% at 30-degrees-C, 87% at 25-degrees-C and 77% at 20-degrees-C). Calorimetric unrest is much higher for young than for adult queens. Heat production is very low in both uncapped and capped brood and less than 30% of that of a newly emerged worker. In most cases temperature showed a significant influence on the metabolic level, although its sign was not homogeneous between the castes or even within them. Locomotor activities are easily recorded by the acoustic frequency spectrum (0-7.5 kHz) and in good agreement with endoscopic observations and calorimetric traces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,,,,,MAR,1992,162,2,,,,,119,130,,10.1007/BF00398337,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00398337,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992HJ08100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drying-rewetting cycles and O-2 fluctuations may critically affect the microbial transformation of plant litter and subsequent stabilization as mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC), but experimental data are still limited. We examined the impacts of DRW cycles, and variable O-2 regimes with constant moisture, on carbon (C) and iron (Fe) dynamics in a degraded Oxisol (under long-term fallow) with added plant residues. In laboratory incubations (> 3 months), both DRW cycling and fluctuating O-2 availability induced a flush of respiration and a temporary increase in microbial biomass C (MBC) following soil rewetting or O-2 exposure, although MBC was consistently suppressed in these treatments relative to the control (60% water holding capacity under constantly aerobic condition). Consequently, DRW cycles significantly increased but O-2 fluctuations significantly decreased cumulative C mineralization relative to the control. Concentrations of short-range-ordered Fe oxides peaked immediately after litter addition and decreased five-fold during the remainder of the experiment. Mineral-associated C (defined as the chemically dispersed < 53 mu m soil fraction) increased 42-64% relative to initial values but was significantly lower under DRW cycling and fluctuating O-2 relative to the control. Correspondingly, these treatments had greater fine particulate organic C (53-250 mu m), despite increased CO2 production under DRW cycling. Our data indicate the potential for rapid and significant accrual of MAOC in a degraded Oxisol, but environmental factors such as DRW cycling and fluctuating O-2 can inhibit the conversion of plant litter to MAOC-possibly by suppressing microbial biomass formation and/or microbial transformations of organic matter.",,,,,,"Ye, Chenglong/0000-0002-7157-5034; Hall, Steven/0000-0002-7841-2019; Hu, Shuijin/0000-0002-3225-5126; Hall, Steven/0000-0002-6499-6260",,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-7061,1872-6259,,,,MAR 15,2019,338,,,,,,383,392,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.12.011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.12.011,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000457657000038,View Full Record in Web of Science

The fish were exposed either to the naturally fluctuating ambient thermal regime (base, representative of inshore Lake Ontario) or to the ambient regime +2 degrees C (base +2 degrees C). both in the presence or absence of 70 mu mol total ammonia(T-amm)/L (0.013 mg NH3-N/L at 15 degrees C, pH = 7.6). The 90-d exposures lasted from June to September 1994 and were designed to mimic an earlier study in which juvenile rainbow trout were fed to satiation. Relative to the earlier study, the restricted ration markedly increased (4-9-fold) the metabolic costs of nitrogen retention, that is, oxygen consumption per unit protein growth. Rainbow trout from the present study exhibited O-2 consumption, and specific growth rates that were 50-75% and 13-20%, respectively, of the O-2 and growth rates of fish fed to satiation. In addition to the pervasive ration effects, juvenile rainbow trout exposed to +2 degrees C in the present experiment managed to retain more nitrogen for growth, at a slightly decreased energetic cost. Fish exposed to +70 mu mol T-amm/L also exhibited higher energetic costs, but this was accompanied by a comparatively large increase in nitrogen retention efficiency. Thus, their costs of growth were substantially reduced. We conclude that a restricted ration of 1%/d will not further impair the ability of juvenile rainbow trout to cope with a chronic small temperature increase. Moreover, sublethal ammonia even may be beneficial under these circumstances.",,,,,"Wood, Chris M/C-3021-2009","Wood, Chris M/0000-0002-9542-2219",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8487,,,,,JUL,1999,128,4,,,,,758,763,,10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0758:EOARRO>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0758:EOARRO>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000089183800021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Spodoptera exigua is a freeze avoidance insect, which can overwinter as third instar larvae in China. Our previous study illustrated that seasonal and diel fluctuating temperatures enhanced its cold hardening. The survival mechanism for this stage, however, is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the survival mechanisms in third instar larvae of S. exigua were correlated with the induction of cryoprotectants and/or expression of hsps. Results showed that trehalose as the main cryoprotectant was accumulated during the cold acclimation (CA), and the level of accumulation fell off sharply when the CA treatment was discontinued (discontinued cold acclimation, DCA). Furthermore, inducible hsp90 was down-regulated in all treatments compared with the control, and hsp70 was up-regulated under conditions ofCAandRCH(rapid cold hardening), which induced 1.23- and 44.00-fold increases compared with the control. Therefore, we considered that both trehalose (as the main cryoprotectant) and hsps (i.e. hsp90 and hsp70) were involved in the regulation of physiological activity of third instar larvae of S. exigua to resist low temperatures during winter.

Heart rate in the hibernating animals often waxed and waned in a fashion that was not clearly linked to the breathing pattern. Similar observations have been made on unanesthetized ground squirrels. Under anesthesia, the effects of vagotomy were small in both euthermic and hibernating animals and led to a 6-8 % increase in heart rate. Vagotomy also eliminated the cyclic fluctuations of heart rate in hibernating animals exhibiting this phenomenon. The post-vagotomy heart rate exhibited by these individuals suggested that both sympathetic excitation and parasympathetic depression were involved in producing these cyclic changes. Vagal stimulation reduced mean heart rate by at most 60-80 % in euthermic and hibernating animals. The strength of the stimulus required to elicit a maximal response in the hibernating animals was 35-45 % greater than that required in euthermic animals. Comparisons of mean heart rates obtained from euthermic and hibernating animals which were vagotomized, intact or stimulated to produce a maximum bradycardia produced temperature quotients of 2.21, 2.15 and 2.3 1, respectively.

While traditional linear measures are used to distinguish between stressed and unstressed treatments, inclusion of nonlinear HRV measures that evaluate data structure and organization shows promise for improving HRV interpretation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the inclusion of nonlinear HRV measures in response to an acute heat episode. Twenty 12- to 14-week-old growing pigs were individually housed for 7 days and acclimated to thermoneutral conditions (20.35 degrees C +/- 0.01 degrees C; 67.6% +/- 0.2% RH) before undergoing one of the two treatments: (1) thermoneutral control (TN; n = 10 pigs) or (2) acute heat stress (HS; n = 10 pigs; 32.6 degrees C +/- 0.1 degrees C; 26.2% +/- 0.1% RH). In Phase 1 of the experimental procedure (P1; 60 min), pigs underwent a baseline HRV measurement period in thermoneutral conditions before treatment [Phase 2; P2; 60 min once gastrointestinal temperature (T-g) reached 40.6 degrees C], where HS pigs were exposed to heated conditions and TN pigs remained in thermoneutral conditions. After P2, all pigs were moved back to thermoneutral conditions (Phase 3; P3; 60 min). During each phase, T-g data were collected every 5 min and behavioural data were collected to evaluate the amount of time each pig spent in an active posture. Additionally, linear (time and frequency domain) and nonlinear [sample entropy (SampEn), de-trended fluctuation analysis, percentage recurrence, percentage determinism (%DET), mean diagonal line length in a recurrence plot] HRV measures were quantified. Heat stressed pigs exhibited greater T-g (P = 0.002) and spent less time in an active posture compared to TN pigs during P2 (P = 0.0003). Additionally, low frequency to high frequency ratio was greater in HS pigs during P3 compared to TN pigs (P = 0.02). SampEn was reduced in HS pigs during P2 (P = 0.01) and P3 (P = 0.03) compared to TN pigs. Heat stressed pigs exhibited greater %DET during P3 (P = 0.03) and tended to have greater %DET (P = 0.09) during P2 than TN pigs. No differences between treatments were detected for the remaining HRV measures. In conclusion, linear HRV measures were largely unchanged during P2. However, changes to SampEn and %DET suggest increased heat stress as a result of the acute heat episode.

To reveal and compare the nutrient cycle in relation to soil microbes for forest and savanna vegetation in this area, we evaluated seasonal fluctuations in microbial biomass carbon (MBC), nitrogen (MBN), and phosphorus (MBP) for 13 months as well as soil moisture, temperature, soil pH levels, and nutrients for both vegetation types in eastern Cameroon. Soil pH was significantly lower in forest (4.3) than in savanna (5.6), and soil N availability was greater in forest (87.1 mg N kg(-1) soil) than in savanna (32.9 mg N kg(-1) soil). We found a significant positive correlation between soil moisture and MBP in forest, indicating the importance of organic P mineralization for MBP, whereas in savanna, we found a significant positive correlation between soil N availability and MBP, indicating N limitation for MBP. These results suggest that for soil microbes, forest is an N-saturated and P-limited ecosystem, whereas savanna is an N-limited ecosystem. Additionally, we observed a significantly lower MBN and larger MB C: N ratio in forest (50.7 mg N kg(-1) soil and 8.6, respectively) than in savanna (60.0 mg N kg(-1) soil and 6.5, respectively) during the experimental period, despite the rich soil N condition in forest. This may be due to the significantly lower soil pH in forest, which influences the different soil microbial communities (fungi-to-bacteria ratio) in forest versus savanna, and therefore, our results indicate that, in terms of microbial N dynamics, soil pH rather than soil substrate conditions controls the soil microbial communities in this area.

Together, vital rates determine trends in numbers, commonly monitored using counts of species abundance. Rapid changes in abundance can give rise to concern, leading to calls for research into the biological mechanisms underlying variations in demography. For the northwest European population of Bewick's swan Cygnus columbianus bewickii, there have been major changes in the population trends recorded during nearly five decades of monitoring (1970-2016). The total number of birds increased to a maximum of ca 30 000 in 1995 and subsequently decreased to about 18 000 individuals in 2010. Such large fluctuation in population numbers is rare in long-lived species and understanding the drivers of this population change is crucial for species management and conservation. Using the integrated population model (IPM) framework, we analysed three demographic datasets in combination: population counts, capture-mark-resightings (CMR) and the proportion of juveniles in winter over a period of similar to 50 years. We found higher apparent breeding success in the years when the population had a positive growth rate compared to years with a negative growth rate. Moreover, no consistent trend in adult and yearling survival, and an increasing trend in juvenile survival was found. A transient life-table response experiment showed that apparent breeding success and adult survival contributed most to the variation in population trend. We explored possible explanatory variables for the different demographic rates and found a significant association between juvenile survival both with the water level in lakes during autumn migration, which affects food accessibility for the swans, and with summer temperatures.

Cor males showed very specific metabolic adjustments compared to the two other lines. By contrast, Oul males showed stronger phenotypic adjustment of its life cycle, and produced metabolic water to compensate water loss by heat stress. Finally, AsymC males had probably more difficulties to acclimate at 36 degrees C, even for a short period, as their adult longevity was significantly reduced.

With the highest daily temperatures (July, 23(rd)) the number of sows taking showers increased to 76.92%. The number of showers taken by the sows during the day is related to the microclimatic conditions, arriving at 788 on a hot day. A single shower has an average length of 59 sec, but this value greatly fluctuates in relation to outside temperature, arriving to an average value of 80 sec.

Sub soil layer was not as heated as the surface, thus, the higher CO2 formation was determined in 15-30 cm soil depth. In the second year of experiment, heattolerant microorganisms become more dominant; therefore, the higher CO2 production observed in surface than the sub soil.

The data were collected during shallow water acoustics experiments which took place near Troon during the summer of 1997. The data reveal clear evidence of internal wave activity which was also apparent in a sequence of rapid CTD yo-yo profiles. Intermittent high frequency internal wave events displayed a period of about 10 min, which is comparable to the local buoyancy period. Vertical amplitudes of 3 m were observed, corresponding to sound speed fluctuations of about +/- 2 in s(-1). Vertical displacement spectra calculated from the temperature data suggest that the observed energy levels did not differ significantly from the generic Garrett and Munk deep water internal wave spectrum. A stochastic internal wave model, based on the Garrett and Munk spectrum, was used to calculate dynamically consistent internal wave fields from which estimates of acoustic variability were derived. Three numerical schemes were used to simulate the vertical advection of the density field: an Eulerian method, a Lagrangian method, and a time-varying mode method. The Eulerian method, based on linear dynamics, performed as well as the more sophisticated techniques and good agreement was obtained between the observed and simulated variability of the sound channel. The observations suggest that the internal wave activity, and hence the acoustic variability, was phase locked to the surface tide.

It was previously thought that these organs were used solely to aid in prey acquisition, but recent findings demonstrated that western diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) use them to direct behavioral thermoregulation, suggesting that facial pits might be general purpose organs used to drive a suite of behaviors. To investigate this further, we conducted a phylogenetic survey of viperine thermoregulatory behavior cued by thermal radiation. We assessed this behavior in 12 pitviper species, representing key nodes in the evolution of pitvipers and a broad range of thermal environments, and a single species of true viper (Viperidae: Viperinae), a closely related subfamily of snakes that lack facial pits but possess a putative thermal radiation receptor. All pitviper species were able to rely on their facial pits to direct thermoregulatory movements, while the true viper was unable to do so. Our results suggest that thermoregulatory behavior cued by thermal radiation is a universal role of facial pits and probably represents an ancestral trait among pitvipers.

In both years rainfall was regularly distributed and the soil was never dry in lower layers. Soil water was assumed to be a non-limiting factor for L. terrestris in this experiment. The demand for food of L. terrestris was calculated using a nonlinear function of soil temperature cited in the literature. It was demonstrated that at the prevailing temperatures the earthworms' demand for food could not be satisfied by the available cut plant material. The biomass, growth and development of L. terrestris was followed during the two seasons. Fluctuations in population density are mainly due to the juveniles. Adults had a rather constant abundance during the 2 yr of investigation. Juveniles hatched in late spring and in autumn. L. terrestris in the field grew slower than in the laboratory, matured later, reached higher body weight at the onset of maturity but lower maximum adult weight.

The objective of this study was to investigate the recolonization of grassland by A. tenuifolia after this species disappeared due to the occurrence of prolonged flooding events. To this end, responses of seed germination to environmental factors associated with gaps, such as light quality and temperature regime, conditions related to seedling survival, and clonal growth of ramets outside the gaps were studied in two different experiments in the field. Environmental factors related to gaps promoted the recruitment of new genets. The combined effect of alternating temperatures and the high red : far-red ratio set off germination from the soil seed bank; germination also was enhanced when signals were generated artificially under the intact canopy in the field. Higher resource availabilities and maximum seedling survival were recorded in canopy gaps, which were the focus of invasion. Grassland recolonization outside the gaps continued rapidly by clonal growth, from small gaps and large ones, even within the dense surrounding canopy. This provoked an intense competition with the other species. Gap opening by disturbances, seed germination in gaps and clonal growth were decisive for the recolonization of A. tenuifolia populations. This sequence of events triggered the recolonization of the plant community by this species, in sites where it had been eliminated by prolonged flooding.

J,"HICKEY, BM",,,,"HICKEY, BM",,,CIRCULATION OVER THE SANTA-MONICA SAN-PEDRO BASIN AND SHELF,PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The spatial and temporal structure of the circulation in Santa Monica-San Pedro basin and over the adjacent mainland shelf has been described in a series of experiments that included moored arrays of current meters, hydrographic surveys, satellite-derived sea surface temperature maps and Lagrangian drifter deployments. This basin, located in the Southern California Bight adjacent to the coast, is roughly 100km long, 40km wide and 900m deep. From the sea surface to a depth of about 250m, the basin is open to the San Diego Trough to the southeast, the Santa Barbara Channel to the northwest, and the Santa Cruz basin to the west. The resulting data set is the first spatially comprehensive data set over the continental slope of the US west coast, the first comprehensive data set in a coastal region of such complicated topography, and the first that includes detailed measurements over a semi-enclosed Shelf, namely, Santa Monica bay. The most significant contributions of the research based on this data set are: (1) demonstration of the alteration of a low mode coastal-trapped waveby a sharp bend in topography; (2) demonstration that fluctuating currents on a semi-enclosed shelf can be driven by the flow along its open boundary; (3) demonstration that topographic waves exist in the completely enclosed portion of coastal basins. In addition, the research allowed an order of magnitude improvement in regional knowledge of both the seasonal and subtidal scale fluctuations within the Southern California Bight. For example, on seasonal scales, the winter surfacing of the California undercurrent (the dominant feature of the seasonal mean flow field) as well as the continuity of the undercurrent in a spatially limited region were addressed. The existence of an equatorward undercurrent at raid water column depths (300-500m) over the continental slope during the late summer to fall season was also documented. On subtidal scales, the data demonstrated that the velocity field is far from quiescent over the basin, even below the depth of the deepest basin sill. Spatially-organized subtidal fluctuations occur at all depths and the time scale of the dominant fluctuations (approximately 20-30d) is a factor of two or more longer than that typical of most coastal shelves. The fluctuations have a subsurface maximum during most of the year and the maximum is best developed in late summer and over the mainland slope of the basin. Propagation characteristics south of the basin and within the basin along its coastal perimeter are consistent with those of first mode freely propagating coastal-trapped waves at these long periods. The long period waves enter the basin from the southeast and then appear to pivot counterclockwise around the basin, so that at least some portion of the waves exits the basin over its western sill. The phase speed of the waves is reduced by an order of magnitude over all but the coastal slope of the basin. Below sill-depth velocity and temperature fluctuations appear to be the signature of freely propagating basin-scale topographic waves driven by the long period upper water column fluctuations. The waves travel counterclockwise around the lower basin at speeds of about 25cm s-1. Current fluctuations over the adjacent inner Santa Monica shelf have significant variance at shorter periods as well as at the longer periods observed over the basin and its slopes. These fluctuations are driven predominantly by boundary forcing over the outer shelf and only secondarily by local wind stress. Wind data suggests that although local upwelling within the Bight is extremely limited from late spring through fall, strong upwelling events occur routinely in winter and early spring. During the summer to fall months, effects of upwelling may be experienced within the Bight, but these effects are primarily the result of upwelling outside the Bight in combination with lateral advection. During periods of strong upwelling outside the Bight, outflow from Santa Monica basin appears to be preferentially directed south of the Channel Islands rather than through the Santa Barbara Channel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0079-6611,,,,,,1992,30,1-4,,,,,37,115,,10.1016/0079-6611(92)90009-O,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0079-6611(92)90009-O,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JY67100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, a number of criteria that are important to natural ventilative cooling strategies can be substantially altered as a result of an external retrofit solution. This paper investigates this experimentally; it presents ventilation rate and internal thermal environment results from full scale testing of a modular, scalable, external low energy retrofit envelope solution applied to an existing 1970s precast concrete building in Ireland. Experimental results of time averaged single sided ventilation rates for three different ventilation opening configurations in a retrofitted office space during a warm and low wind summer period are analysed and compared to a single configuration control space. Results show that the highest time averaged ventilation rates were measured in the control space although a similar distribution was present in one retrofit opening configuration. Analysis of tracer concentration decay fluctuation profiles during tests suggest increased unsteady flow effects in the control space compared to all retrofit configurations. This is likely due to the different responses to turbulent diffusion processes and wind pressure fluctuations at the window opening compared to the louvred retrofit design. Zone thermal stratification and diurnal temperature variation within the control and retrofit spaces were measured during each ventilation rate test and also continuously for an extended period.

Food colloids open a lot of different possibilities in dessert production, which are used to perform certain functions. Pectin is a traditional agent for jams and jellies, but its application extends to fruit products for the food industry. In food product technology pectin is added as gelling agent and stabilizer. The three apple varieties -'Antonovka', 'Baltais Dzidrais' and 'Zarja Alatau' harvested in Latvia State Institute of Fruit Growing were used for the experiment. Photometric measurement was used to determine the composition of pectin. Pectin was isolated from the apple mass by leaching with ethanol, and from the residues - by extracting with diluted sodium hydroxide solution. By adding carbasol and sulphuric acid to the extract, through different intermediate stages carroty condensation product formed, which was photometrically measured at 525 nm. Pectin, pH and soluble dry matter were determined in fresh and frozen apple mass from apples of three ripeness stages. On the basis of worked out functional analysis of colloids, it is possible to optimize regulation of heat processes for different ripeness stages of apples. It is established that ripeness stage influences pectin quantity in fruits, but there are no data about pectin quantity changes in frozen fruits. By fruit ripening under the impact of enzyme protopectinase, protopectin hydrolyzes and transforms into pectin, which flows from the intercellular spaces into protoplasm of cells. Therefore ripe as well as heat treated fruits are soft and loose. It is important to measure pectin in frozen apple mass, in order to determine its potential jellying power. For each kind of product appropriate conditions have to be chosen for freezing, as well as the condition of products before freezing has to be taken into consideration in order to reduce the harmful influence on their quality to the minimum. The results of the research indicate that pectin quantity in frozen apple mass has decreased substantially. This susceptibility of sugar containing products to temperature fluctuations possibly is due to their high concentration of unfrozen water and lower melting temperature. It is possible to calculate the mass fraction of ice depending on temperature and moisture content in product what is very important for prognosticating the product quality. The aim of the research is to compare changes of pectin quantity in fresh and frozen apple products depending on storage time.

The response characteristics of the aircraft turbulence sensors were first tested to decrease measurement errors for turbulent heat transfer and fluxes, including water vapour flux, before being installed on the Ilyushin-18 aircraft that was used in joint Russian-Japanese atmospheric boundary-layer research. The results show that the atmospheric turbulence measured in a frequency range of 0(.)01 to 10 Hz yielded proper estimates of fluxes. Errors in measurements of the turbulence made from the aircraft were also analysed. Aerodynamic distortions linked to the aircraft's body and propellers were determined from flight test experiments. Time lags between vertical wind speed fluctuations and air temperature fluctuations measured by the aircraft thermometer, and those between vertical wind speed fluctuations and air humidity fluctuations measured by an ultraviolet hygrometer (open-path system) and an infrared hygrometer (closed-path system) were estimated. The vertical wind speed and air temperature sensor measurements showed no time lag, but a time lag of 0.6 s occurred between vertical wind speed and ultraviolet hygrometer measurements. The time lag between vertical wind speed and the infrared hygrometer measurements depended on flight conditions due to air pumping load, and had to be defined for each sampling leg. Accounting for the time lag was critical for water vapour flux measurements and helped to eliminate large systematic errors.

We have immobilized such a particle in a narrow channel and carried out a combined experimental and theoretical study of the non-equilibrium dynamics of a binary solvent around it - lasting from the very moment of switching illumination on until the steady state is reached. In the theoretical study we use both a purely diffusive and a hydrodynamic model, which we solve numerically. Our results demonstrate a remarkable complexity of the time evolution of the concentration field around the colloid. This evolution is governed by the combined effects of the temperature gradient and the wettability, and crucially depends on whether the colloid is free to move or is trapped. For the trapped colloid, all approaches indicate that the early time dynamics is purely diffusive and characterized by composition layers travelling with constant speed from the surface of the colloid into the bulk of the solvent. Subsequently, hydrodynamic effects set in. Anomalously large nonequilibrium fluctuations, which result from the temperature gradient and the vicinity of the critical point of the binary liquid mixture, give rise to strong concentration fluctuations in the solvent and to permanently changing coarsening patterns not observed for a mobile particle. The early time dynamics around initially still Janus colloids produces a force which is able to set the Janus colloid into motion.

How FTCs will contribute to global processes in seasonally snow-covered ecosystems in the future is of particular importance as climate change progresses and winter snowpacks decline. Our understanding of these contributions is limited because there has been little consideration of inter- and intrayear variability in the characteristics of FTCs, in part due to a limited appreciation for which of these characteristics matters most with respect to a given biogeochemical process. Here, we introduce the concept of effective FTCs: those that are most likely linked to changes in key soil processes. We also propose a set of parameters to quantify and characterize effective FTCs using standard field soil temperature data. To put these proposed parameters into effective practice, we present FTCQuant, an R package of functions that quantifies FTCs based on a set of user-defined parameter criteria and, importantly, summarizes the individual characteristics of each FTC counted. To demonstrate the utility of these new concepts and tools, we applied the FTCQuant package to re-analyze data from two published studies to help explain over-winter changes to N2O emissions and wet-aggregate stability. We found that effective FTCs would be defined differently for each of these response variables and that effective FTCs provided a 76 and 33% increase in model fit for wet-aggregate stability and cumulative N2O emission, respectively, relative to conventional FTC quantification methods focusing on fluctuations around 0 degrees C. These results demonstrate the importance of identifying effective FTCs when scaling soil processes to regional or global levels.

However, soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in response to tree litter management remains insufficiently researched. We conducted a one-year field experiment at a fast-growing sweetgum tree plantation to evaluate the effects of leaf litter management on soil available nutrients, respiration rate and nitrogen mineralization rate. Three leaf litter treatments were applied, which were: (1) natural input (control); (2) double input and (3) non-input. It was found that the double input treatment increased soil inorganic nitrogen and microbial biomass nitrogen, but had little effect on microbial biomass carbon, dissolved organic carbon or dissolved organic nitrogen compared with natural input. The non-input treatment caused dissolved organic carbon to decrease compared with natural input. The respiration rate increased in the double input treatment, with a positive priming effect observed. Soil net ammonification, nitrification and mineralization rates also increased in the double input treatment in specific seasons. Meanwhile, positive linear relationships between respiration rate and all nitrogen transformation rates were observed for all treatments. Soil temperature was found to be an important prediction factor for predicting the respiration rate and mineralization as seasonal variations, but not for litter-induced fluctuations. Soil water content and mineral nitrogen were the primary drivers of litter-induced change to the respiration rate, whereas mineral nitrogen and microbial biomass were primary drivers of mineralization change. These results suggest that changes in soil nitrogen mineralization rate are strongly associated with the soil respiratory process, resulting in a potentially strong plant-soil feedback mechanism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0266-0032,1475-2743,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/sum.12823,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.12823,,JUN 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000818994700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A temperature decrease in the heat-sensing membrane of the pit organ has the potential to enhance heat flux between their endothermic prey and the thermal sensors, affect the optimal functioning of thermal sensors in the pit membrane and reduce the formation of thermal afterimages, improving thermal detection. We examined the potential for respiratory cooling to improve strike behaviour, capture, and consumption of endothermic prey in the South American rattlesnake, as behavioural indicators of thermal detection. Snakes with a higher degree of rostral cooling were more accurate during the strike, attacking warmer regions of their prey, and relocated and consumed their prey faster. These findings reveal that by cooling their pit organs, rattlesnakes increase their ability to detect endothermic prey; disabling the pit organs caused these differences to disappear. Rattlesnakes also modify the degree of rostral cooling by altering their breathing pattern in response to biologically relevant stimuli, such as a mouse odour.

Despite the importance of these new challenges, understanding the dynamic thermal tolerance and thermal safety status of some major culture species remains scarce, including large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), the most productive mariculture fish in China. Here, we conducted a relatively complete thermal biology assessment of cultured large yellow croaker using long-term acclimation experiments, critical thermal testing and the collected habitat sea surface temperature (SST) data. Changes in body size, oxidative stress and metabolic biomarkers during acclimation were also measured to evaluate the effects of prolonged thermal stress on performance. Results showed that the critical thermal limits of large yellow croaker acclimated at 11-30 degrees C ranged from 5.27 degrees C to 36.64 degrees C, and the total thermal tolerance zone was 444.74 degrees C-2. Thermal limits increased as acclimation temperature rise, and the estimated acclimation response ratios ranged from 0.32 to 0.63, showing obvious thermal plasticity. The estimated post-acclimation thermal sensitivity values (0.80-1.28) for large yellow croaker acclimated at 11-30 degrees C were close to 1, and the heat-(5.78 degrees C) and cold -thermal safety margins (6.33 degrees C) were both high, showing sufficient thermal tolerance to cope with current observed highest SST and the predicted SST caused by climate change. However, performance results showed that long-term exposure to 30 degrees C would induce energy redistribution and tradeoffs between health/growth and heat tolerance, leading to significantly decreased body weight and increased superoxide dismutase activity in the gill. This result indicates a potential disadvantage of growing large yellow croaker in floating sea-cages, because the shallow culture depth, high density and limited moving spaces in this farming mode make the fish susceptible to fluctuations in SSTs, constrain their ability in behavioral thermoregulation, and increase the risks of hypoxia and disease infections. Thus, these tradeoffs may make the current floating sea-cage farming more vulnerable to elevated temperatures on production. Finally, since our recorded highest in situ SST and warming rate (in summer) have reached up to 30.1 degrees C and 1.2 degrees C/d, we propose that the large yellow croaker farms currently operating in the main producing area of China are already at the risk of summer heatwaves. In the future, more efforts should be made to the selection of heat-resilient strains or the exploration of alternative farming systems in large yellow croaker aquaculture industry to avoid or mitigate potential production decline.",,,,,"Xu, Peng/J-4018-2012","Xu, Peng/0000-0002-1531-5078",,,,,,,,,,,,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,,,DEC 15,2022,561,,,,,,,,738665,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738665,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738665,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000848310800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The capacity to form a persistent SSB is often associated with physical dormancy, where seed coats are impermeable at the time of dispersal. Germination literature often speculates, without empirical evidence, that dormancy-break in physically dormant seeds is the result of microbial action and/or abrasion by soil particles. We tested the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis in four widely distributed neotropical pioneer tree species (Apeiba membranacea, Luehea seemannii, Ochroma pyramidale, and Cochlospermum vitifolium). Seeds were buried in five common gardens in a lowland tropical forest in Panama, and recovered at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after burial. Seed permeability, microbial infection, seed coat thickness, and germination were measured. Parallel experiments compared the germination fraction of fresh and aged seeds without soil contact, and in seeds as a function of seed permeability. Contrary to the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis the proportion of permeable seeds, and of seeds infected by cultivable microbes, decreased as a function of burial duration. Furthermore, seeds stored in dark and dry conditions for 2 years showed a higher proportion of seed germination than fresh seeds in identical germination conditions. We determined that permeable seeds of A. membranacea and O. pyramidale had cracks in the chalazal area or lacked the chalazal plug, whereas all surfaces of impermeable seeds were intact. Our results are inconsistent with the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis of dormancy loss and instead suggest the existence of multiple dormancy phenotypes, where a fraction of each seed cohort is dispersed in a permeable state and germinates immediately, while the impermeable seed fraction accounts for the persistent SSB. Thus, we conclude that fluctuations in the soil temperature in the absence of soil abrasion and microbial infection are sufficient to break physical dormancy on seeds of tropical pioneer trees.",,,,,"Sarmiento, Carolina/ABF-3966-2020","Sarmiento, Carolina/0000-0002-8575-7170; Zalamea, Paul-Camilo/0000-0002-0987-4164; Dalling, James/0000-0002-6488-9895; Davis, Adam/0000-0002-7196-1197",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-462X,,,,,JAN 13,2015,5,,,,,,,,799,10.3389/fpls.2014.00799,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2014.00799,,,,,,,,25628640,,,,,WOS:000348029600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Much progress has been made to quantify momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean for a wide range of wind and wave conditions. Yet, despite the fact that global heat budgets are now at the forefront of current research in atmospheric, oceanographic, and climate problems and despite the good research progress in recent years, much remains to be done to better understand and quantify air-sea heat transfer. It is well known that ocean-surface waves may support momentum transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, but the role of the waves in heat transfer has been ambiguous and poorly understood. Here, evidence is presented that there are surface wave-coherent components of both the sensible and the latent heat fluxes. Presented here are data from three field experiments that show modulations of temperature and humidity at the surface and at 10-14 m above the surface, which are coherent with the surface wave field. The authors show that the phase relationship between temperature and surface displacement is a function of wind speed. At a 10-12-m elevation, a wave-coherent heat transfer of O( 1) W m(-2) is found, dominated by the latent heat transfer, as well as wave-coherent fractional contributions to the total heat flux ( the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes) of up to 7%. For the wind speeds and wave conditions of these experiments, which encompass the range of global averages, this wave contribution to total heat flux is comparable in magnitude to the atmospheric heat fluxes commonly attributed to the effects of greenhouse gases or aerosols. By analogy with momentum transfer, the authors expect the wave-coherent heat transfer to decay with height over scales on the order of k(-1), where k is the characteristic surface wavenumber; therefore, it is also expected that measurements at elevations of O( 10) m may underestimate the contribution of the wave-induced heat flux to the atmosphere.",,,,,"Veron, Fabrice/G-2505-2012","Veron, Fabrice/0000-0001-5514-9767; Lenain, Luc/0000-0001-9808-1563",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,,,,,APR,2008,38,4,,,,,788,802,,10.1175/2007JPO3682.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2007JPO3682.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000254897400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the model, 28% of the heat content variability is driven by the seasonal and interannual fluctuations of the atmospheric heat flux in the seasonally ice free regions. The heat flux variability associated with Atlantic Water advected through Fram Strait drives 31% of the heat content variability. Changes of temperature and circulation drive Fram Strait heat transport variability, and these two effects project on different modes and thus drive heat content variations in different parts of the Eurasian Basin. A second branch of Atlantic Water is modified in the Barents Sea and the variations of the heat flux associated with the Barents Sea water branch penetrating the deep Arctic yield heat content variations in the Eurasian Basin. The effect of the Bering Strait heat flux variations remains limited to the Chukchi Sea. Autonomous observing system may be able to capture the Arctic heat content variability.

Physiological responses of plants to environmental factors differed between plants in shallow versus deep soils and species. Plants on deeper soils were less affected by high vapour pressure deficit (VPD), temperature, and irradiance due to increased plant available water, partly provided by their less confined roots, resulting in higher overall g(s), E, A, and Psi(MD). Stomatal closure reduced A but not C-i, indicating that high temperature and radiation were also significantly contributing to the diurnal decline in A through reversible photoinhibition.

In the first cropping, the plants were taller than in the second cropping, regardless of the crop. The stomatal conductance of sorghum plants fluctuated in the second cropping during the development period, while maize plants showed decreasing linear behaviour. Water-use efficiency in sorghum plants was higher during the second cropping compared with the first cropping. In maize plants, in the second cropping, the water-use efficiency showed a slight variation in relation to the first cropping. It was concluded that the environmental conditions as degree-days, temperature, photoperiod and pluvial precipitation influence the phenology and physiology of both crops during the first and the second cropping periods, specifically cycle duration, plant height, leaf area, net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and water-use efficiency, indicating that both crops respond differentially to environmental changes during the growing season.",,,,,"Pimentel, Leonardo D./H-5455-2012","Pimentel, Leonardo D./0000-0003-2620-4039; Barbosa, Maria Antonia/0000-0002-8701-0599",,,,,,,,,,,,,0931-2250,1439-037X,,,,APR,2020,206,2,,,,,263,276,,10.1111/jac.12377,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.12377,,NOV 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000496816900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Growing concern about the global climate crisis together with scattered reports about the interactive effects of temperature and light parameters on plants necessitates more detailed information about these effects. Furthermore, the actual light emitting diode (LED) lighting technology allows mimicking of light climate scenarios more similar to natural conditions, but to fully exploit this in plant cultivation, easy-to-apply knowledge about the natural variation in light quantity and spectral distribution is required. Here, we aimed to provide detailed information about short and long-term variation in the natural light climate, by recording the light quantity and quality at an open site in Switzerland every minute for a whole year, and to analyze its relationship to a set of previous tree seedling growth experiments. Changes in the spectral composition as a function of solar elevation angle and weather conditions were analyzed. At a solar elevation angle lower than 20 degrees, the weather conditions have a significant effect on the proportions of blue (B) and red (R) light, whereas the proportion of green (G) light is almost constant. At a low solar elevation, the red to far red (R:FR) ratio fluctuates between 0.8 in cloudy conditions and 1.3 on sunny days. As the duration of periods with low solar angles increases with increasing latitude, an analysis of previous experiments on tree seedlings shows that the effect of the R:FR ratio correlates with the responses of plants from different latitudes to light quality. We suggest an evolutionary adaptation where growth in seedlings of selected tree species from high latitudes is more dependent on detection of light quantity of specific light qualities than in such seedlings originating from lower latitudes.",,,,,"Hoch, Guenter/H-1505-2018","Hoch, Guenter/0000-0003-0985-9746",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1999-4907,,,,AUG,2019,10,8,,,,,,,610,10.3390/f10080610,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10080610,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000482949200097,View Full Record in Web of Science

In 2020 (1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020), we continuously monitored the surface energy fluxes of a shrub ecosystem using an eddy covariance system. Additionally, meteorological variables, such as temperature and rainfall, were measured. The study site was located in Chunhua of China, which is a gully region of the Chinese Loess Plateau. The diurnal and seasonal dynamic changes in the energy balance of this region were analysed, Bowen and energy balance ratios were calculated, and environmental factors affecting the variations in latent (LE) and sensible heat fluxes (H) were explored. The results showed that the annual net radiation (Rn), LE, H, and soil heat flux (G) were 2385.6, 1059.1, 787.6, and - 48.3 MJ/m 2 , respectively, with 490.58 MJ/m 2 energy remaining undetected. The main part of the annual energy of the shrub ecosystem was latent heat, accounting for 44.4% of Rn. A seasonal variation in each energy component was evident, and the diurnal variation showed a single peak curve. LE in the growing season was dominant, and the proportion of LE and H in the net radiation in the non-growing season showed little difference. The Bowen ratio changed monthly and significantly fluctuated from 0.2 in July to 4.0 in December. It was high in winter and low in summer, with little fluctuation. The annual energy balance ratio was 0.8. The energy balance closure in the non-growing season was greater than that in the growing season. Both H and LE were significantly correlated with net radiation, and H was negatively correlated with rainfall, soil moisture, and soil temperature. Unlike H, LE was significantly positively correlated with soil temperature. In addition, LE was positively correlated with air humidity gradient and water vapour pressure difference. ?? 2021 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, a 3-year in situ soil core incubation experiment was conducted along a 2431-m altitudinal gradient in an alpine-gorge region on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which includes dry valley shrubland, valley-mountain ecotone forest, subalpine coniferous forest, alpine coniferous forest and alpine meadow. The invertase, urease, and acid phosphatase activities in the soil organic layer (OL) and mineral layer (ML) were measured at five critical periods from 2013 to 2017. Higher soil enzyme activity was observed in the subalpine coniferous forest and alpine meadow, whereas lower activity was observed in the dry valley shrubland and valley-mountain ecotone forest. Overall, the seasonal sensitivity of soil enzyme activity decreased with increases in altitude. In the subalpine and alpine coniferous forests, the seasonal sensitivity of soil enzyme activity was significantly higher in the ML than in the OL. The key drivers of the seasonal variation in soil enzyme activity exhibited marked variation with changes in altitude, and these variations depended on the enzyme type and soil layer. Significant effects of temperature and precipitation on seasonal fluctuations in enzyme activities were observed at lower altitudes, whereas soil freeze-thaw cycles significantly affected the seasonal changes in acid phosphatase activity at higher altitudes. In addition, the seasonal variations in specific enzyme activities differed from those found for enzyme activities, which indicated that microorganisms might have mediated the effects of environmental factors on soil enzyme activity by altering the enzyme production efficiency. Briefly, the seasonal fluctuations in soil enzyme activity and their dominant drivers varied greatly among different altitudes in the alpine-gorge region, implying that soil biochemical processes will exhibit differential responses to ongoing climate change at different altitudes.",,,,,"WANG, QIN/AGX-6523-2022","WANG, QIN/0000-0002-5511-0878; Cao, Rui/0000-0003-0314-2242",,,,,,,,,,,,,0929-1393,1873-0272,,,,OCT,2021,166,,,,,,,,104078,10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104078,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104078,,MAY 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000679310400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, no simulation models are available to support the analysis of the impact of environmental conditions and management practices on hazelnut production. This paper presents two modelling solutions to simulate hazelnut tree growth and development under potential and water-limiting conditions, partly based on generic approaches used in tree modelling and on new modules specifically developed to address hazelnut tree peculiarities. The two solutions differed in the simulation of the photosynthetic rate, in one case reproduced using a Farquhar-type model (gross photosynthesis), whereas a radiation use efficiency approach (net photosynthesis) was used in the other. The coherence of simulation outputs at leaf, organ and plant level and the models responsiveness to weather conditions was verified and discussed with literature data, and the performances of the modelling solutions were evaluated using experimental data collected between 2002 and 2013 growing seasons in Piedmont region (northern Italy). Results highlighted the reliability of both the solutions in reproducing phenological development (mean relative root mean squared error, RRMSE = 8.61%), as well as the time trend of specific leaf area (RRMSE = 26.32%) and leaf area index (RRMSE = 18.46%). Also, the simulation of the temporal dynamics of soil water content and temperature along the soil profile led to outputs very close to observations (RRMSE = 14.02% and 10.32%, respectively). The solution based on gross photosynthesis resulted slightly more accurate in reproducing the year-to-year fluctuation in yields (RRMSE = 25.03%) compared to the one based on net photosynthesis (RRMSE = 30.40%). These results proved the suitability of these modelling solutions to be used as simulation engines within a variety of applications, ranging from decision support systems for the management of the orchard to complex yield forecasting systems.

To make a case for female choice based on male calls, it is necessary to examine male call variation in the field and identify repeatable call features that are reliable indicators of male size or symmetry. Female preference for these reliable call features and the underlying assumption behind this choice, female preference for larger males, also need to be examined. We found that females did prefer larger males during mating, as revealed by the longer mating durations and longer spermatophore retention times. We then examined the correlation between acoustic and morphological features and the repeatability of male calls in the field across two temporal scales, within and across nights. We found that carrier frequency was a reliable indicator of male size, with larger males calling at lower frequencies at a given temperature. Simultaneous playback of male calls differing in frequency, spanning the entire range of natural variation at a given temperature, revealed a lack of female preference for low carrier frequencies. The contrasting results between the phonotaxis and mating experiments may be because females are incapable of discriminating small differences in frequency or because the change in call carrier frequency with temperature renders this cue unreliable in tree crickets.

Methane emissions as a result of methanogenesis and methanotrophy in soil are affected by several environmental factors such as temperature, oxygen and groundwater level. The objective of this study was to analyse methane cycling as a function of soil depth. Materials and methods In this study, methane cycling and soil organic matter mineralization were investigated in a drained fen grassland area of Ljubljana marsh, Slovenia that has been subjected to reclamation strategies for several centuries. Potential mineralization, methane production and methane oxidation rates were measured in slurry incubation experiments with soil samples from 10 sampling depths of a 1-m profile. In addition, the extent of iron reduction in the soil was determined. Results and discussion The potential for methane production was low in the investigated soil profile, even in constantly flooded layers below the water table fluctuations. During anaerobic incubations, the highest accumulated concentrations and production rates of methane were observed in the upper 10-cm layer and the lowest in deeper soil layers, indicating that plant exudates are the main source of energy for heterotrophic soil microbes and that methanogenesis in deeper layers is limited by the availability of appropriate organic substrates. Methane oxidation was on the other hand active throughout the soil profile, suggesting that the potentially active methane oxidizing community is present despite low methane production. The highest abundance and activity of methanotrophs was detected in the water table fluctuation layers. Conclusions Together, these findings have implications for understanding the biogeochemical function of drained peat soils and emphasize the influence of drainage on quality of soil organic matter and consequently on methane production even in flooded soils.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1439-0108,1614-7480,,,,JUL,2017,17,7,,,SI,,1874,1882,,10.1007/s11368-016-1648-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-016-1648-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000405668700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Long-term trapping data sets (2-6 yr) of T. castaneum in and around seven rice mills were analyzed to assess the efficacy of sulfuryl fluoride fumigation (n = 25). Fumigation efficacy was evaluated as the percentage reduction in mean trap captures of adults and proportion of traps capturing at least one adult beetle. Beetle trap captures fluctuated seasonally, with increased captures during the warmer months, June-September, that dropped off during the cooler months, October-March. Fumigations resulted in a 66 +/- 6% (mean +/- SE) reduction in mean trap captures within mills and a 52 +/- 6% reduction in the proportion of traps capturing at least one adult beetle. Lengths of time for captures to reach prefumigation levels, or rebound rates, were variable, and adult capture levels inside were most influenced by seasonal temperature changes. Temperatures inside mills followed those outside the mill closely, and a significant positive relationship between outside temperatures and trap captures was observed. Inside and outside trap captures exhibited a significant, positive relationship, but fumigations consistently led to reductions in beetle captures outside of mills, highlighting the interconnectedness of populations located inside and outside mill structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0493,,,,,FEB,2013,106,1,,,,,499,512,,10.1603/EC12276,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EC12276,,,,,,,,23448067,,,,,WOS:000314882200060,View Full Record in Web of Science

On average 0.342 (0.001-1.528) ducklings per female fledged yearly. Within the ranges observed, the total number of ducklings that fledged seemed to be independent of the number of breeding females (range 800-2700) and the number of Herring Gulls in the study period. Indications were found of a sex-linked mortality occurring in some years. Correlations with a number of environmental factors suggested that low temperature in winter, high temperature at the end of May and the beginning of June, calm weather in May and June, and a high number of Herring Gulls were profitable for fledging success. However, a stepwise multiple regression indicated only the temperature at the beginning of June as significant, explaining about 18 % of the total variance. The absence of a negative relation with breeding gull numbers confirms the interpretation of the role of the Herring Gull as a secondary mortality factor. Experiments showed that Goose Virus Hepatitis (syn. Goose Influenza or Goose Pest) was a primary cause of mortality among ducklings older than one week. The effect of diseases in the field was difficult to establish as diseased and weakened ducklings were usually eaten by gulls.

To analyze physiological responses to forcing environmental variables, experimental conditions should mimic natural conditions as closely as possible. For filter-feeding organisms in particular, diet quality and quantity is one of the environmental parameters that can differ markedly between experimental and field conditions. In the hatchery, Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, commonly show good physiological performance and growth on a mixed algal diet of Tisochrysis lutea, formerly Isochrysis aff. galbana clone Tahiti (T-Iso), and Chaetoceros calcitrans, presumably as it provides a good supply of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3. The present study tests whether the fluctuating biotic and abiotic conditions in the field modify the structure and function of oyster mitochondria. One group of oysters was maintained in the intertidal zone, and the other group was fed the mixed diet in a nearby experimental hatchery under salinity and temperature conditions equivalent to those in the field. After 4 weeks of conditioning, the functional capacities and membrane lipid composition of gill mitochondria were measured. For essential polyunsaturated fatty acids, only the proportion of 20:5n-3 differed between field and laboratory oysters, and confirmed the capacity of the mixed diet T-Iso + C. gracilis, to provide the essential PUFA. Nevertheless, proportions of other FA (e.g., 22:5n-6 and non-methylene-interrupted FA) differed markedly between laboratory and field-conditioned oysters. Mitochondrial oxygen uptake, cytochrome c oxidase activity, content of cardiolipin and concentration of cytochrome b were significantly lower in laboratory-conditioned than in field-conditioned oysters. These results indicate that laboratory conditioning, although allowing similar growth and gonad maturation, only partially mimics conditions that allow C. gigas to maintain mitochondrial function. Although our experimental design cannot ascertain what difference between experimental laboratory and field conditions led to changes in membrane composition and mitochondrial function, differences in nutritional quality (other than known essential PUFA) and abiotic factors (e.g., oxygen availability, emersion or daily temperature fluctuations) had a major impact on mitochondrial properties in oysters.",,,,,,"Racotta, Ilie/0000-0001-8748-8288; Soudant, Philippe/0000-0003-3090-5612",,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,MAY,2015,162,5,,,,,1033,1045,,10.1007/s00227-015-2646-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-015-2646-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000352798800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, the mechanisms of BTDAC formation are studied through laboratory experiments and modelling, with additional low-level inflow from external rural areas and a divergent outflow in the opposite direction in the upper part of the mixed layer. Strong turbulent plumes in the central region mix the flow between lower and higher levels up to the inversion height. There are shear-driven turbulent eddies and weaker buoyant plumes around the periphery of the urban area. As the approach flow is very weak, the recirculating streamlines within the dome restrict the ventilation, and the dispersion of pollution emitted from sources below the inversion height leading to a rise in the mean concentration. Low-level air entrained from rural areas can, however, improve ventilation and lower this concentration. This trend can also be improved if the recirculating structure of the BTDAC flow pattern over urban areas breaks down as a result of the surface temperature distribution not being symmetrical, or as the approach wind speed increases to a level comparable with the mean velocity of circulation, or (except near the equator) the urban area is large enough that the Coriolis acceleration is significant.

The performance of the sensor is evaluated extensively under field and laboratory conditions by comparing the sensor outputs with direct measurements from calibrated pCO(2) measuring systems and the thermodynamic carbonate calculation of pCO(2) from discrete samples. Under stable laboratory condition, the sensor agreed with a calibrated water-air equilibrator system at -3.0 +/- 4.4 mu atm during a 2-month intercomparison experiment. When applied in field deployments, the larger differences between measurements and the calculated pCO(2) references (6.4 +/- 12.3 mu atm on a ship of opportunity and 8.7 +/- 14.1 mu atm on a mooring) are related not only to sensor error, but also to the uncertainties of the references and the comparison process, as well as changes in the working environments of the sensor. When corrected against references, the overall uncertainties of the sensor results are largely determined by those of the pCO(2) references (+/- 2 and +/- 8 mu atm for direct measurements and calculated pCO(2), respectively). Our study suggests accuracy of the sensor can be affected by temperature fluctuations of the detector optical cell and calibration error. These problems have been addressed in more recent models of the instrument through improving detector temperature control and through using more accurate standard gases. Another interesting result in our laboratory test is the unexpected change in alkalinity which results in significant underestimation in the pCO(2) calculation as compared to the direct measurement (up to 90 mu atm).",,,,,"Feely, Richard A./ABI-5740-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1541-5856,,,,,APR,2014,12,,,,,,264,280,,10.4319/lom.2014.12.264,http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lom.2014.12.264,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000336246500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

To achieve this, quails were divided into two equal groups (250 heads/lot), the control group was maintained on a 24-hour lighting period and experimental group was maintained in a program with discontinuous illumination, using natural lighting completed with artificial light with a variable duration (12 hours and 30 minutes during the first 6 months of laying curve, 14 hours and 10 minutes in the following). To complete the study on the battery cage effect temperature was recorded on each level in both groups. During the period studied, the results were significantly higher in the experimental group compared with the controls ones. The average production performance regarding the percentage of laying was higher by 10.21% and egg production per capita was higher by 21.92%. Average consumption of mixed feed was 4.33% higher in the experimental group, while specific consumption was 25.51% higher in the control group quail. Average mortality was 10.60% lower in the experimental quails group. In conclusion, the use of a discontinuous lighting with variable duration program depending on the laying curve (lower in the first part of the lay curve and higher in the second part of it) is recommended.

Such experiments are typically more complex, longer, more expensive, and harder to interpret than simple organism-level benchtop experiments. Are they worth the extra effort? Using outdoor mesocosms, we investigated the effects of ocean warming (OW) and acidification (OA), their combination (OAW), and their natural fluctuations on coastal communities of the western Baltic Sea during all four seasons. These communities are dominated by the perennial and canopy-forming macrophyte Fucus vesiculosus-an important ecosystem engineer Baltic-wide. We, additionally, assessed the direct response of organisms to temperature and pH in benchtop experiments, and examined how well organism-level responses can predict community-level responses to the dominant driver, OW. OW affected the mesocosm communities substantially stronger than acidification. OW provoked structural and functional shifts in the community that differed in strength and direction among seasons. The organism-level response to OW matched well the community-level response of a given species only under warm and cold thermal stress, that is, in summer and winter. In other seasons, shifts in biotic interactions masked the direct OW effects. The combination of direct OW effects and OW-driven shifts of biotic interactions is likely to jeopardize the future of the habitat-forming macroalga F. vesiculosus in the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, we conclude that seasonal mesocosm experiments are essential for our understanding of global change impact because they take into account the important fluctuations of abiotic and biotic pressures.",,,,,"Ito, Maysa/AAI-7619-2021; Hiebenthal, Claas/AAF-9564-2021; Matthiessen, Birte/U-5459-2017; Wahl, Martin/D-2038-2016","Hiebenthal, Claas/0000-0003-4774-3242; Matthiessen, Birte/0000-0001-9673-1876; Rilov, Gil/0000-0002-1334-4887; Hamer, Jorin/0000-0003-4009-6003; Ito, Maysa/0000-0003-1189-7338; Wahl, Martin/0000-0001-8703-3857; Guy-Haim, Tamar/0000-0002-6962-0262",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,APR,2020,65,4,,,,,807,827,,10.1002/lno.11350,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11350,,NOV 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000496028200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

During spring and summer they reproduce clonally and efficiently by parthenogenesis. At the end of summer aphids perceive the shortening of day length which triggers the production of sexual individuals - males and oviparous females - that will mate and lay overwintering cold-resistant eggs. Recent large scale transcriptomic studies allowed the discovery of transcripts and functions such as nervous and hormonal signaling involved in the early steps of detection and transduction of the photoperiodic signal. Nevertheless these experiments were performed under controlled conditions when the photoperiod was the only varying parameter. To characterize the response of aphids under natural conditions, aphids were reared outdoor both in summer and autumn and material was collected to compare their transcriptomic profile using a cDNA microarray containing around 7000 transcripts. Statistical analyses revealed that close to 5% of these transcripts (367) were differentially expressed at two developmental stages of the process in response to the autumnal environmental conditions. Functional classification of regulated transcripts confirmed the putative contribution of the neuro-endocrine system in the process. Furthermore, these experiments revealed the regulation of transcripts involved in juvenile hormone synthesis and signaling pathway, confirming the key role played by these molecules in the reproductive mode switch. Aphids placed under outdoor conditions were confronted to a range of abiotic factors such as temperature fluctuations which was confirmed by the differential expression of an important proportion of heat shock protein transcripts between the two seasons. Finally, this original approach completed the understanding of genetic programs involved in aphid phenotypic plasticity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This provided a novel method for on-line, real time monitoring of soil gas dynamics. In closed-system headspace experiments, O-2 and CO2 (measured at m/z values 32 and 44, respectively) showed anti-phase diurnal fluctuations in low-intensity simulated daylight and under a light-dark (LD, 12:12h) regime. O-2 increased during periods of illumination and decreased in the dark. The inverse was true for CO2 production. Ar (m/z = 40) concentration and temperature (degreesC) remained constant throughout the experiments. The same phase-related oscillations, in CO2 and O-2 concentrations, were observed at 2 and 5 cm depth in soil cores. The O-2 concentration -did not oscillate diurnally at 10cm depth. In below-ground experiments, CH4 (m/z = 15) concentration showed diurnal cycles at 2, 5 and 10 cm depth. The CH4 production had the same diurnal phase cycle as CO2 but with lower amplitude. Evidence of below-ground diurnal oscillations in N-2 (m/z = 28) concentration was provided at 5 cm depth. The scale of production and consumption of gases associated with soil-atmosphere interactions and below-ground processes, are shown to be a multifaceted output of several variables.

Although a significant fraction of phosphorus (P) entering brackish tidal waters may be retained in the riverbed, such storage could be temporary because a fraction of retained P can be remobilized during the fluctuation of physiochemical and biological conditions in the river water. This study aimed to identify the roles of environmental parameters in remobilizing P from selected sections of East Creek on the Delmarva Peninsula in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. It included a series of field measurements and controlled laboratory experiments using sediment and water samples from the creek. Environmental parameters chosen to identify P release included biologically mediated redox change, pH, salinity, and temperature. Our results show that enhanced microbial activity and pH fluctuation play major roles in P release from all sites, and the extent of P release from headwater sediments (agriculture-intensive area) was three to four times higher than that in the lower reaches of the creek (wetlands). Increases in salinity and temperature promoted release of P, albeit in insignificant amounts. Calculation based on regression equations developed from statistical analysis of P release and retention data indicated that a significant amount of P could be remobilized from the creek bed sediments under current conditions. Furthermore, the relationship of water O isotope ratios with tide and water column P concentrations indicates that the tides play a major role in diluting and removing P from the upstream region of the creek. These results highlight the role of biogeochemical processes in remobilization of legacy P from river bed sediment and export from a watershed.",,,,,"McGrath, Joshua/Y-1207-2019","McGrath, Joshua/0000-0002-1212-8795",,,,,,,,,,,,,0361-5995,1435-0661,,,,MAY-JUN,2015,79,3,,,,,826,837,,10.2136/sssaj2015.03.0117,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2015.03.0117,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000355587000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The mooring of a natural fluorescence sensor was conducted during winter to early spring (January to April 1998), late spring (May 2000) and summer (July to August 2000) at a station in Otsuchi Bay on the north east coast of Japan. The bio-optical parameters, a(ph)*, (phi(c)/phi(f))(max) and k(cf), were measured by water sampling and incubation experiments twice a week. The temporal variation in a(ph)* was expressed as an exponential of chl a. This relationship varied seasonally. The variations in (phi(c)/phi(f))(max) were related to chl a during winter to early spring, and to chl a and temperature during late spring and summer. The value of k(cf) was relatively low and stable during the winter and early spring; it reached higher values during late spring to summer, when temperature and light intensities were also higher. Based on these relationships, the long-term monitoring of chl a and primary production from natural fluorescence was realized in coastal water where environmental conditions and phytoplankton abundance fluctuated markedly.

J,"HANSSON, LA",,,,"HANSSON, LA",,,FACTORS INITIATING ALGAL LIFE-FORM SHIFT FROM SEDIMENT TO WATER,OECOLOGIA,,,,,,,,,,,,"In enclosure and whole-lake experiments, I tested whether life-form shift (recruitment) is a passive process induced by turbulence. a seasonal phenomenon. or a behavior that can be induced by alterations in environmental variables. The number of algal cells recruited from the sediment varied considerably during the experimental period. The most important migrating genera in this study were: Cryptomonas, Dinobryon, Gonyostomum, Gymnodinium, Peridinium, and Synura. An obvious conclusion is that it is not the same factor in each case that causes life-form shift, but that different triggering factors operate in different algal species. Turbulence and temperature were similar in all treatments and therefore did not cause the considerable fluctuations and trends in algal recruitment in the enclosures. This suggests that life-form shift is not a passive process driven by wind and temperature-induced currents. In the enclosure experiment, alterations in the light regime explained a major part (up to 53%) of the variation in recruitment for most genera. For Gymnodinium this was corroborated in the whole-lake experiment, where the depth of the euphotic zone explained 41% of the variation in recruitment. For Gymnodinium, however. 64% of the variation in recruitment was explained by the depth of the ''oxycline'', whereas 52% of the variation in recruitment of Synura were explained by the depths of the euphotic zone and the oxyline. Peridinium pusillum and P. wisconsinense showed low recruitment at high zoo-plankton abundance and high recruitment at low zoo-plankton abundance in the lake experiment, as well as in the enclosure experiment.

The impact of the choice of the turbulence closure scheme and the description of meteorological forcing on the level of stratification is shown. The model is run with different parameterizations of vertical mixing of heat and momentum: the Mellor-Yamada level 2 turbulence closure scheme used by Sharples and Tett (1994), the quasi-equilibrium Mellor-Yamada-Galperin level 2.5 'k' model (Galperin et al., 1988; Ruddick et al., 1995) and a simple Richardson number-dependent mixing scheme (Proctor and James, 1996).

Using this model, the effects of wind stirring and surface heat flux on the thermal stratification have been investigated. Experiments using different wind forcing from predicted hourly values to monthly average are shown. Further tests included averaged solar radiation and dew-point temperature. The depths of the isotherms are fairly sensitive to the description of the wind stress, and the surface layer temperature to the solar radiation. The experiment with hourly predicted wind stress gave the deepest thermocline, because of its high fluctuations. Monthly averages of solar radiation lead to too much heating of the surface layer at Station CS due to a combined effect with the wind speed.

Here, we present a month-long, high frequency record of acoustic ebullition data from an ice-covered lake. The record shows that ebullition occurs almost exclusively when atmospheric pressure drops below a threshold that is approximately equal to the long-term average pressure. The intensity of ebullition is proportional to the amount by which the pressure drops below this threshold.

Second, a field incubation study to quantify broiler litter N mineralization using similar soils and litter application rates as the laboratory incubation. Broiler litter was applied at an equivalent rate of 350 kg total N ha(-1) for both studies except for control treatments. Subsamples were taken at different timing for both experiments for NO3-N and NH4-N determinations. In the laboratory experiment, soil moisture regimes had no significant impact on litter-derived inorganic N. Total litter-derived inorganic N across all treatments increased from 23 mg kg(-1) at time 0, to 159 mg kg(-1) at 93 d after litter application. Significant differences were observed among the soil types. Net litter-derived inorganic N was greater for Brooksville followed by Ruston and Catlin soils. For both studies and all soils, NH4-N content decreased while NO3-N content increased indicating a rapid nitrification of the mineralized litter N. Litter mineralization in the field study followed the same trend as the laboratory study but resulted in much lower net inorganic N, presumably due to environmental conditions such as precipitation and temperature, which may have resulted in more denitrification and immobilization of mineralized litter N. Litter-derived inorganic N from the field study was greater for Ruston than Brooksville.

Fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and light associated with the freeze/thaw cycle can significantly impact the photophysiology of ice-associated taxa. The effects of multiple co-stressors (i.e., freezing temperature and high brine salinity or sudden high light exposure) on the photophysiology of ice algae were investigated in a series of ice tank experiments with the polar diatomFragilariopsis cylindrusunder different light intensities. When algal cells were frozen into the ice, the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (PSII;F-v/F-m) decreased possibly due to the damage of PSII reaction centers and/or high brine salinity stress suppressing the reduction capacity downstream of PSII. Expression of therbcL gene was highly up-regulated, suggesting that cells initiated strategies to enhance survival upon freezing in. Algae contained within the ice-matrix displayed similar levels ofF(v)/F(m)regardless of the light treatments. Upon melting out, cells were exposed to high light (800 mu mol photons center dot m(-2) center dot s(-1)), resulting in a rapid decline inF(v)/F(m)and significant up-regulation of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). These results suggest that ice algae employed safety valves (i.e., NPQ) to maintain their photosynthetic capability during the sudden environmental changes. Our results infer that sea ice algae are highly adaptable when exposed to multiple co-stressors and that their success can, in part, be explained by the ability to rapidly modify their photosynthetic competence - a key factor contributing to algal bloom formation in the polar seas.",,,,,"Seger, Andreas/AAH-4093-2019; Yoshida, Kazuhiro/AAG-8324-2021; Suzuki, Koji/GVS-9807-2022; Kennedy, Fraser/M-5145-2019; Suzuki, Koji/A-4349-2013; Suzuki, Koji/AAD-2630-2022","Seger, Andreas/0000-0001-7018-0455; Yoshida, Kazuhiro/0000-0001-5768-8561; Suzuki, Koji/0000-0001-5354-1044; Kennedy, Fraser/0000-0003-1796-0764; Suzuki, Koji/0000-0001-5354-1044; McMinn, Andrew/0000-0002-2133-3854",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3646,1529-8817,,,,OCT,2020,56,5,,,,,1323,1338,,10.1111/jpy.13036,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.13036,,JUL 2020,,,,,,32464687,,,,,WOS:000545637300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study included a period of 40 years (1970-2009). Variability of groundwater conditions is basis of water relation ratings, or trends of changes on given area, particularly on forest area. The Zielonka Forest is situated in the middle section of the Warta river catchment, in the central part of the Wielkopolska region, and its western border lies about 6 kilometres north-west of Poznan. The area is situated in the western part of the Wielkopolska-Mazovian climatic region. The natural landscape is of early glacial type of Pleistocene and Holocene formation. Postglacial drifts, deposits from the Poznan stage of the Wurm glaciations, are the main parent materials of the soils in this area. The granulometric composition is formed by sands with a low clay content, overlying loose sands with admixture of gravel and slightly sandy clay. Scots pine (Pinus silvestris L.) is the dominant tree species but also oak (Quercus robur. L., Q. petrea (Matt.) Liebl.), alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn., Alnus incana (L.) Moench.), larch (Larix sp. Mill.) and rarely spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) occur there. The predominant forest site types are: fresh mixed coniferous forest, fresh coniferous forest, wet coniferous forest and alder swamp forest. The greatest yearly fluctuations in groundwater level were observed in alder/ash swamp forest site types, where groundwater level was the highest (in shallow groundwater). Extended the meteorological observations on Zielonka station for 1970-1985, based on meteorological observations from Poznan station are reasonable. The resulting regression and correlation coefficients relation for precipitation sum, mean air temperature (monthly and annual) are statistically significant on customarily accepted levels of significance alpha = 0.05. Consequently complete data of precipitation and air temperatures have been obtained for the study period od 1970-2009 for the Zielonka Forest representative meteorological station in Zielonka village. Time trend for annual precipitation sum in Zielonka Forest in the period 1970-2009 is not statistically significant. However, time trend over that period of the average annual air temperature in the Zielonka Forest is statistically significant and amounts to about +0.05 degrees C/year. These trends for the last 10 years during the study period are respectively -0.28 mm/year and +0.11 degrees C/year. These figures can be considered as a confirmation of the adverse climate changes described in the IPCC Report (2007), in relation to the studied area. For the analysis of groundwater conditions selected years 1970, 2002 and 2009. According to the meteorological conditions (precipitation, air temperature), these three years can be regarded as the average (normal). Average groundwater levels in Zielonka Forest (based on Forest District Potasze analyses) throughout the 40-year study period (1970-2009) fell by about 50 cm, while in the last seven- years, fell by 20 cm. Assuming an average porosity of the aquifer layers to 34%, respectively in these periods decreases the ground retention were thus about 160 mm and 60 mm. Variability of groundwater levels has been reduced twice (variation coefficient of groundwater levels dropped by half). The largest groundwater decreases recorded on forest site types. Much lower on coniferous forest and alder/ash alder swamp forest site type. Groundwater lowering in Zielonka Forest can be associated with intensified adverse climate changes. But this is not the only explanation. The second factor, adversely effect on groundwater conditions in Zielonka Forest and its buffer zone, which was not the subject of this paper, is so-called anthropopressure.

As a consequence of these perturbations, many lotic ecosystems are exposed to complex combinations of nonchemical and chemical stressors. These stressors comprise temperature fluctuations, flow alterations, elevated solute loads or xenobiotics, and all these factors can pose stress upon aquatic ecosystems on different temporal, spatial and biological scales. Factorial experiments are essential to reveal causal relationships especially between combined stressors and their effects in the environment. However, experimental tools that account for the complexity of running waters across different ecosystem compartments, levels of biological organisation, natural or anthropogenic environmental gradients, and replicability are rare. Here we present a new research infrastructure consisting of streamside mobile mesocosms (MOBICOS) that allows analysing the effects of stressors and stressor combinations through multifactorial experiments in near-natural settings and across anthropogenic pressure gradients. Consisting of eight container-based running water laboratories operated as bypasses to running surface waters, MOBICOS combines in situ real-time monitoring of physicochemical and biological parameters with manipulative experiments across ranges of environmental conditions. Different flume types can be set up within MOBICOS to separate and combine different ecosystem compartments (pelagic, epibenthic and hyporheic zones) in a flexible and modular way. Due to its compact design, the MOBICOS units can be shifted easily to particular sites of interest. Furthermore, simultaneous operation of multiple MOBICOS units at different sites allows the integration of natural gradients in multifactorial experiments. We highlight the versatility of the MOBICOS experimental infrastructure with two case studies addressing (a) hydraulic control of lotic biofilms and (b) pollution-induced community tolerance of biofilms along an environmental gradient. The modular and mobile MOBICOS units have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of causal relationships between natural environmental oscillations, anthropogenic stressors and their combined ecological impacts on lotic aquatic ecosystems beyond existing stream mesocosm approaches.",,,,,"Brauns, Mario/M-7878-2014; Fink, Patrick/A-5901-2009; Risse-Buhl, Ute/J-6793-2019; Kamjunke, Norbert/H-9614-2018; Borchardt, Dietrich/D-1729-2009","Brauns, Mario/0000-0002-5012-9721; Fink, Patrick/0000-0002-5927-8977; Risse-Buhl, Ute/0000-0002-7219-5172; Schmitt-Jansen, Mechthild/0000-0002-4541-6515; Kamjunke, Norbert/0000-0002-8016-5352; Anlanger, Christine/0000-0001-6666-422X; Borchardt, Dietrich/0000-0002-6074-2829",,,,,,,,,,,,,1434-2944,1522-2632,,,,JUN,2020,105,3-4,,,,,63,73,,10.1002/iroh.201902009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201902009,,JAN 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000507973000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mean seasonal fluctuations of abundances were derived from long term data series collected from 1978 to 2003 for both species. In situ predator-prey experiments over a seasonal cycle were used to estimate the seasonal variation of the consumption rate of N. integer on E. affinis and to verify the order of magnitude of the biological parameters given by the model. Predator-prey experiments revealed a high seasonal variation in maximum consumption rates with a mean of 56 +/- 9 ind. pred(-1) d(-1). Maxinium consumption rates were always higher for adults than for juveniles of Neomysis integer. Recorded selectivities were higher on nauplii than on copepodids + adults of Eurytemora affinis, both for the juveniles and the adults of N. integer. Neomysis integer mainly fed on meroplanktonic larvae, when they were available in higher abundances, than E. affinis in their environment. Spring increases of abundance for Eurytemora affinis copepodids + adults seemed to be mainly controlled by temperature whereas its decreasing abundance in summer was more related to Neomysis integer predation, suggesting that summer fluctuations of E. affinis abundance are probably controlled by mysid predation at summer times. Using a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model, the seasonal peak of abundance of the mysid N. integer was well reproduced considering a predation on copepodids + adults of E. affinis, and suggested a dependence between mysid and copepod seasonal variations. However, the seasonal peak amplitude could not be explained solely by a predation on copepodids + adults or on nauplii of the copepod. Thus, N. integer is probably dependent on the seasonal fluctuations of the copepod's abundance, complementing its diet with macrophytal detritus during periods of scarce food. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that in both the ICM and HGCM whose atmospheric components contain no internal high-frequency variability, irregularity of ENSO can be described by a low-order chaotic process generated by nonlinear interaction between the seasonal cycle and interannual oscillation. Numerical experiments reveal that the behavior of the ENSO cycle in this class of coupled models is sensitive to changes in coupling strength. By increasing the coupling strength, the model ENSO cycles evolve from nonoscillatory (stable) to time-periodic (unstable) and eventually to chaotic regimes, Although these models give reasonable ENSO frequency and spatial structure compared with observations, the phase-locking with the annual cycle is apparently too strong. Inclusion of stochastic forcing in these models can have two effects on the ENSO cycles. It can break up strong annual phase-locking in the unstable regime and it can also excite ENSO-like variability in the stable regime, where the coupling strength is so weak that no self-sustaining oscillations can exist in the coupled models. In contrast, the ENSO cycle in the CGCM, where internal high-frequency fluctuations are included, does not appear to be driven by a low-order chaos. By comparing the invariant properties of the dynamics derived from long-term sea surface temperature time series obtained from the different coupled models, it was found that the dynamical characteristics of the CGCM response were similar to those of the ICM forced with stochastic forcing in the stable regime, suggesting that the ENSO cycles in the CGCM may be dominated by stable dynamics driven by stochastic processes. Testing for nonlinearity gives further support to this result. The nonlinear time series analysis also implies that stochastic processes rather than chaotic dynamics are likely to be a major source of ENSO irregularity in reality.",,,,,"Chang, Ping/A-1642-2013","Chang, Ping/0000-0002-9085-0759",,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-2789,,,,,NOV 15,1996,98,2-4,,,,,301,320,,10.1016/0167-2789(96)00116-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-2789(96)00116-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VT60900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, how alternative life-history optima might promote competitor coexistence has received little attention. The rotifers Brachionus plicatilis and Brachionus manjavacas are two cryptic species with a considerable ecological overlap in relation to biotic factors. These species often co-occur in temporal brackish ponds characterised by environmental fluctuations. In these rotifers, sexual reproduction results in diapausing stages, which are able to survive through adverse conditions but constrain current population growth. In the present work, the differential responses of both cryptic rotifer species to varying salinities and temperatures in terms of population growth, sexual reproduction and diapause patterns (i.e., investment, viability and hatchability of diapausing eggs) were investigated to assess their possible roles in species coexistence. B. plicatilis and B. manjavacas showed differential responses to salinity and temperature and differed consistently in traits involved in diapause. The niche overlap between B. plicatilis and B. manjavacas decreased dramatically when the temperature and salinity response niche axes were added to a number of previously studied biotic niche axes. The results suggest that B. plicatilis exploits ephemeral and favourable conditions (low salinity) to invest in diapause, which would accelerate its exclusion from the water column but promote its long-term persistence. The findings show that cryptic species may evolve different compromises among life-history traits, allowing ecological divergence, and that ecological divergence may be uncoupled from morphological divergence for some factors in the abiotic environment.

The mechanisms behind these high salinity events are investigated using a comprehensive dataset of temperature and salinity profiles from ARGO floats and sea surface height anomaly maps. The spatial and temporal distribution of the Persian/Arabian Gulf outflow to the Sea of Oman is also studied using ARGO profiles. Persian Gulf water (PGW) is mainly measured close to the Strait of Hormuz or along the Oman coast on the continental slope in the Sea of Oman. Both mooring and ARGO data show that high salinity PGW can be advected off the slope and into the interior. More high salinity water is measured in the interior of the Sea of Oman within three months after the Gonu passage in summer 2007, which is caused by the combination effect of the oceanic responses to Cyclone Gonu and a clockwise eddy circulation located at northern Ras al Hadd. At other times, the high salinity water appears more in isolated patches and rare in the interior. This study provides a first look at the high salinity events appearing after Gonu and the properties and dynamics of the PGW in the northern Arabian Sea and Sea of Oman. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Female rabbits from generations 16 and 36 (n = 72 and 79, respectively) of a line founded and selected to increase litter size at weaning were compared simultaneously. Female rabbits were subjected to normal (NC), nutritional (NF) or heat (HC) challenging conditions from 1st to 3rd parturition. Animals in NC and NF were housed at normal room temperatures (18 degrees C to 25 degrees C) and respectively fed with control (11.6 MJ digestible energy (DE)/kg dry matter (DM), 126 g digestible protein (DP)/kg DM, and 168 g of ADF/kg DM) or low-energy fibrous diets (9.1 MJ DE/kg DM, 104 g DP/kg DM and 266 g ADF/kg DM), whereas those housed in HC were subjected to high room temperatures (25 degrees C to 35 degrees C) and the control diet. The litter size was lower for female rabbits housed in both NF and HC environments, but the extent and timing where this reduction took place differed between generations. In challenging conditions (NF and HC), the average reduction in the reproductive performance of female rabbits from generation 16, compared with NC, was -2.26 (P<0.05) and -0.51 kits born alive at 2nd and 3rd parturition, respectively. However, under these challenging conditions, the reproductive performance of female rabbits from generation 36 was less affected at 2nd parturition (-1.25 kits born alive), but showed a greater reduction at the 3rd parturition (-3.53 kits born alive; P<0.05) compared with NC. The results also showed differences between generations in digestible energy intake, milk yield and accretion, and use of body reserves throughout lactation in NC, HC and NF, which together indicate that there were different resource allocation strategies in the animals from the different generations. Selection to increase litter size at weaning led to increased reproductive robustness at the onset of an environmental constraint, but failure to sustain the reproductive liability when the challenge was maintained in the long term.

Data were recorded at Lake Banyoles, a small lake in Catalonia, Spain, with a warm, salty, and turbid underground inflow. Turbulent scales are well resolved in the two observed convective layers and allow determination of the dissipation rates of the turbulent kinetic energy, e, and of the turbulent temperature fluctuations, c, which are found to be 3.3 x 10(-7) C-2/s and 2.7 x 10(-9) W/kg for one of the layers and 5.9 x 10(-7) C-2/s and 3.8 x 10(-9) W/kg for the other. Thermal spectra for the convective layers look universal in viscous-diffusive and viscous- convective subranges. Characteristic vertical displacements within convective layers could also be obtained on the basis of Thorpe scales and were found to be 0.3 times the layer thickness. Vertical convective fluctuations were estimated and found to be of the order of 10(-4) m/s. When turbulent fluxes were determined within the convective layers on the basis of microstructure data and compared to those at the diffusive interfaces, they showed a stationary state with a mean thermal flux of 3.5 x 10(-6) C m/s. A comparison of experimental heat fluxes to different models favors the scaling model of Grossman and Lohse ( 2000) for Rayleigh-Benard convection and the double-diffusive convection model of Fernando (1979a, 1979b) for low stability. If the 4/3 power law is assumed, then the parameterization proposed by Taylor ( 1988) for diffusive interfaces at low values of the density ratio is also in accordance with our data.",,,,,"Roget, Elena/C-3689-2009; Sanchez, Xavier/B-6968-2009","Roget, Elena/0000-0002-4950-0204; Sanchez, Xavier/0000-0002-3069-4942",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,FEB 13,2007,112,C2,,,,,,,C02012,10.1029/2006JC003750,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JC003750,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000244369400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Protein digestion and metabolism further increase body temperature. An experiment was conducted with six pairs of pigs (of 47.3 +/- 1.3 kg initial body weight) exposed to natural HS to assess the effect of substituting dietary protein-bound AA by free AA on morphology and gene expression of intestinal epithelial and serum concentration (SC) of free AA. Treatments were: high protein, 21.9% crude protein (CP) diet (HShp) and low protein, 13.5% CP diet supplemented with crystalline Lys, Thr, Met, Trp, His, Ile, Leu, Phe, and Val (HSaa). The HShp diet met or exceeded all AA requirements. The HSaa diet was formulated on the basis of ideal protein. Pigs were fed the same amount at 0700 and 1900 hours during the 21-d study. Blood samples were collected at 1700 hours (2.0 h before the evening meal), 2030 hours, and 2130 hours (1.5 and 2.5 h after the evening meal). At the end, all pigs were sacrificed to collect intestinal mucosa and a 5-cm section from each segment of the small intestine from each pig. Villi measures, expression of AA transporters (y+L and B-0) in mucosa, and SC of AA were analyzed. Ambient temperature fluctuated daily from 24.5 to 42.6 degrees C. Weight gain and G.F were not affected by dietary treatment. Villi height tended to be larger (P = 0.10) and the villi height:crypt depth ratio was higher in duodenum and jejunum of pigs fed the HSaa diet (P < 0.05). Gene expression of transporter y+L in jejunum tended to be lower (P < 0.10) and transporter B-0 in the ileum was lower (P < 0.05) in HSaa pigs. Preprandial (1700 hours) SC of Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Thr, Trp, and Val was higher (P < 0.05), and Phe tended to be higher (P < 0.10) in HShp pigs.

In conclusion, feeding HS pigs with low protein diets supplemented with free AA reduces the damage of the intestinal epithelia and seems to improve its absorption capacity, in comparison with HS pigs fed diets containing solely protein-bound AA.

The stress factor was the planned blood taking from them. In an hour after this procedure, blood was taken again from the jugular vein with the aim to determine the concentration of cortisol in experimental animals. Based on the different cortisol concentration in blood, the cows have been differentiated into three groups: I - with high stress resistance, II - with medium stress resistance and III - with low stress resistance. The aim of the studies was to establish the relationship between the different stress resistance in animals and the development and function of the udder, the milk productivity and the heat resistance of the organism under summer temperature loading in the conditions of Ukraine. It has been established that the animals of group I were milked in double-quick time (P < 0.001), and their milk-ejection rate was 1.4 kg/min (P < 0.001) compared to the third group. They also had a higher reaction rate at the beginning of milking (P < 0.001). The parts of the udder in the cows of this group are more evenly developed, which serves as the best precondition for the implementation of the milk flow reflex by machine milking. Cows with low stress resistance have a well-defined prolonged latent period at the beginning of machine milking. This is explained by the delay in the reaction of their mammary gland in response to the beginning of milking. It has been suggested that this disadvantage can be mitigated by using a more improved milking equipment, with an udder massage regime, which is capable to compensate the disturbance of the milk yield reflex in cows, which are more sensitive to stress. The influence of different stress resistance on fat and protein content in the milk of Holstein cows has not been properly defined. But in comparison with low stress-resistant animals, milk yields for 305 days of the first lactation were higher in highly stress-resistant animals - by 639 kg (P < 0.001), in cows of the middle group -by 216 kg (P < 0.05). The lower resistance of cows to stress makes them vulnerable in conditions of temperature load during the hottest months (July, August) of the summer period in Ukraine. Their body reacts to such a load with sharper fluctuations in body temperature, pulse, respiration rate and thermal sensitivity index as compared to their peers with high level of stress resistance (P < 0.01...0.001).

Biophysical mechanisms behind cuticular hydrocarbon acclimation across species,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maintaining water balance is vital for terrestrial organisms. Insects protect themselves against desiccation via cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). CHC layers are complex mixtures of solid and liquid hydrocarbons, with a surprisingly diverse composition across species. This variation may translate into differential phase behaviour, and hence varying waterproofing capacity. This is especially relevant when temperatures change, which requires acclimatory CHC changes to maintain waterproofing. Nevertheless, the physical consequences of CHC variation are still little understood. We studied acclimatory responses and their consequences for CHC composition, phase behaviour and drought survival in three congeneric ant species. Colony sub-groups were kept under cool, warm and fluctuating temperature regimes. Lasius niger and Lasius platythorax, both of which are rich in methyl-branched alkanes, showed largely predictable acclimatory changes of the CHC profile. In both species, warm acclimation increased drought resistance. Warm acclimation increased the proportion of solid compounds in L. niger but not in L. platythorax. In both species, the CHC layer formed a liquid matrix of constantly low viscosity, which contained highly viscous and solid parts. This phase heterogeneity may be adaptive, increasing robustness to temperature fluctuations. In Lasius brunneus, which is rich in unsaturated hydrocarbons, acclimatory CHC changes were less predictable, and warm acclimation did not enhance drought survival. The CHC layer was more homogeneous, but matrix viscosity changed with acclimation. We showed that ant species use different physical mechanisms to enhance waterproofing during acclimation. Hence, the ability to acclimate, and thus climatic niche breadth, may strongly depend on species-specific CHC profile.",,,,,,"Baumgart, Lucas/0000-0003-1006-0659",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,AUG,2022,225,16,,,,,,,jeb243847,10.1242/jeb.243847,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.243847,,,,,,,,35775442,,,,,WOS:000849639200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, a coherent statement on the problem is missing, because of both a small number of suitable observations and an incomplete understanding of the properties of reactive tracers in turbulent media. It has been suggested that horizontal advection may be the dominant process behind the observed distributions of phytoplankton and zooplankton, acting to mix tracers with longer reaction times (R-t) down to smaller scales. Conversely, the relative distributions of sea surface temperature and phytoplankton has been attributed to small-scale upwelling, where tracers with longer Rt are able to homogenize more than those with shorter reaction times. Neither of the above mechanisms can explain simultaneously the (relative) spectral slopes of temperature, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. Here, with a simple advection model and a large suite of numerical experiments, we concentrate on some of the physical processes influencing the relative distributions of tracers at the ocean surface, and we investigate (1) the impact of the spatial scale of tracer supply, (2) the role played by coherent eddies on the distribution of tracers with different Rt, and (3) the role of diffusion (so far neglected). We show that diffusion determines the distribution of temperature, regardless of the nature of the forcing. We also find that coherent structures together with differential diffusion of tracers with different Rt impact the tracer distributions.

However, in order to optimize N. crassa for biotechnological applications, metabolic pathways during growth under different environmental conditions must be addressed. Reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is a technique that provides a high-throughput platform from which to measure the expression of a large set of genes over time. The selection of a suitable reference gene is critical for gene expression studies using relative quantification, as this strategy is based on normalization of target gene expression to a reference gene whose expression is stable under the experimental conditions. This study evaluated twelve candidate reference genes for use with N. crassa when grown in continuous culture bioreactors under different light and temperature conditions. Based on combined stability values from NormFinder and Best Keeper software packages, the following are the most appropriate reference genes under conditions of: (1) light/dark cycling: btl, asl, and vma1; (2) all-dark growth: btl, tbp, vma1, and vma2; (3) temperature flux: btl, vma1, act, and asl; (4) all conditions combined: vma1, vma2, tbp, and btl. Since N. crassa exists as different cell types (uni- or multi-nucleated), expression changes in a subset of the candidate genes was further assessed using absolute quantification. A strong negative correlation was found to exist between ratio and threshold cycle (C-T) values, demonstrating that C-T changes serve as a reliable reflection of transcript, and not gene copy number, fluctuations.

Through three years of observation and two years of field manipulation, I investigated simultaneous constraints on the spatial distribution of Lupinus nanus, a native annual legume that grows in dense patches in California grasslands. I transplanted L. nanus across its own patch boundaries, yet within apparently suitable habitat, and assessed the demographic success of naturally occurring and seeded plants in plots with and without competitor removal in years that varied in temperature and rainfall. Core sites were defined as those consistently densely occupied, whereas peripheral sites were densely occupied only during some years, and exterior sites were consistently unoccupied or very sparsely occupied. Site types (core, periphery, and exterior) differed in soil moisture, P, and NO3. Competition limited emergence in all site types in the dry/warm year and in patch peripheries in the wet/cool year. Population fitness (seeds produced per seed added) was >1.0 in cores during all years. Peripheral sites had fitness near replacement in the wet/cool year, which was greatly increased by competition removal. Exterior fitness was <1.0 in both experimental years, regardless of seed addition and competitor removal. Seed addition did not increase site-specific fitness, and a seed bank was found to be present in all site types. Herbivory was greater in patch cores and peripheries than in exteriors. Soil variation exerted the most consistent control over patch limits, while competition played an intermittent role in excluding Lupinus from patch peripheries.

Alterations in the phenology of either consumers or their prey might decouple trophic relationships and reduce consumer growth and survival, and this potential for mismatches is especially pronounced in migratory organisms that change habitats. Juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) migrate from natal streams to lake habitats, and we hypothesised that their in-lake growth and survival depends on whether timing of migration matches suitable lake conditions. We used mixed effects models to test the hypotheses that: (a) the most successful entry times correspond to favourable prey densities and lake thermal conditions; and (b) a mismatch in fish entry time and seasonal lake dynamics can reduce fish growth and survival. These models were applied to an 11-year time series of migration timing, capture rate and size at smolting for juvenile sockeye salmon in Lake Washington, WA, USA. Juvenile sockeye salmon entering Lake Washington later in the season encountered higher zooplankton abundance and warmer water, and experienced higher average rates of growth and survival, but the optimal date for lake entry ranged across years by up to a month. Zooplankton abundance and bloom timing affected fish growth and relative survival more than lake temperature, and survival was most influenced by zooplankton abundance in the spring when fish entered the lake. In contrast, fish size at seaward migration from the lake depended primarily on zooplankton abundance in the spring as they left the lake rather than the previous spring when they entered. These results suggest that maintaining a wide window of lake entry dates allows this population to capture the annually-varying period of favourable conditions, minimising mismatches between juvenile fish and their resources and thereby enabling successful recruitment in an unpredictable environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,JAN,2019,64,1,,,,,46,55,,10.1111/fwb.13193,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13193,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000453853500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Model results with refinement of the grid size to 0.125 nautical miles revealed different forms of submesoscale structures in the gulfs surface layer such as the high Rossby number (Ro) threads (elongated spots of Ro > 1 with typical width and length of 2-3 km and 10-50 km, respectively), cyclonic vortices with Ro > 1 core of 4-6 km diameter, and spiral cyclonic eddies (spirally wrapped high Rossby number threads) of 10-15 km diameter. The high potential vorticity threads presumably formed during the development phase, while the cyclonic vortices and spiral cyclonic eddies during the relaxation phase of upwelling. One of the simulated submesoscale cyclonic eddies, at the beginning with the Ro > 1 core extension as deep as 31-66 m was traced for the period of 33 days. The power spectral density of temperature and velocity fluctuations in the surface layer pointed at some increase of spectral levels and shallowing of spectral slopes towards -2 on the shorter (submesoscale) wavelengths with the refinement of model grid.

This paper describes a continuous-flow system that we have used extensively for measurement of oxygen exchange and nitrogen transformations in different communities of lowland streams, i.e. the water, the sediment, and the macrophyte-biofilm community. The system, which is set up on the stream bank, consists of several macrophyte and sediment chambers equipped with a double-flow system that ensures an internal water velocity close to that in the stream and which, by continuously renewing the water, mimics diel fluctuation in stream temperature and water chemistry. Water temperature and dissolved oxygen are measured continuously and the data stored on magnetic tape. Water samples are collected in a refrigerator and analysed using standard chemical procedures. 2. The application of the system is illustrated using results obtained during a 2-day summer experiment in a shallow macrophyte-rich stream. The biological processes in the stream were mainly associated with the macrophyte-biofilm community and the sediment, those in the water being negligible. Oxygen release was confined to the macrophyte-biofilm community, the sediment consuming oxygen both by day and by night. Whole-system gross production and dark respiration occurred at similar rates (6-7 g O2 m-2 day-1), net balance being about zero. Inorganic nitrogen was consumed both by the sediment and to a greater extent by the macrophytes, the diel average consumption being 1 g N m-2 day 1. 3. The sum of the activity in the macrophyte and sediment chambers corresponded to the overall activity of the stream section as determined by upstream/downstream mass balance. This indicates that the results obtained with the continuous-flow chambers realistically describe the oxygen and the nitrogen metabolism of the stream.",,,,,"Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Sand-Jensen, Kaj KSJ/F-3041-2015","Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Sand-Jensen, Kaj KSJ/0000-0003-2534-4638",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,DEC,1991,26,3,,,,,495,506,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb01414.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb01414.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991HC04600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Abundance data from 73 sites over sixteen degrees of latitude were used to categorize intertidal community structure, diversity, and biogeographic differences in dominant species around the coast of New Zealand. These showed that communities mapped to four general regions, which relate to coastal morphology and the characteristics of the dominant water masses around the country. There were distinct biogeographic breakpoints at Cook Strait, which separates the North and South Islands and, to a lesser degree at East Cape, where a warm-water flow deflects seaward. The low and mid-tidal zones along almost all of the east coast were dominated by fucoid algae, with a distinct shift in dominant species around the lower North Island, whereas almost the entire west coast was dominated by invertebrates, particularly mussels and barnacles. Seventeen years of quantitative sampling data, done quarterly or half-yearly in three regions of the east coast of the South Island, were compared with physical data, including the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), sea surface temperature (SST), and wave climate. Overall SSTs have remained relatively constant over the period, but there were large anomalies during ENSO periods. Significant wave height (Hs) has increased at all sites over this period. The dominant cover of fucoid algae varied considerably at two shore heights over the years, but large declines in cover occurred during periods when the SOI index was high (either positively or negatively), particularly during El Nino periods. Understory assemblage structure, diversity and bare space responded to large declines in the fucoid canopy, whereas herbivores did not. Two sets of experiments, done over separate periods of three years, corroborated that disturbance to the dominant canopy resulted in cascading responses in the mid-shore community: perennial understory species declined, bare space increased, coralline algae increased, and ephemeral algae were more abundant. These effects lasted for two years and up to at least six years. Overall, this study shows that changes to the wave climate, most likely in concert with the wider-ranging effects of ENSO, rather than SST, underpin long-term fluctuations to these coastal communities. This study highlights the importance of understanding a more complete suite of drivers and responses of climate change in marine systems. A complex interplay of physical variables, operating on both wide and local scales, can trigger cascading effects, and their interaction with biological, demographic and ecological variables determines recovery dynamics.

We investigated local enhancement of trochus Trochus niloticus (Gastropoda) on 3 coral reefs in Western Australia. 12 000 tiny hatchery-produced juveniles, 1 to 4 mm basal shell width (BSW), were released onto each of 4 intertidal sites on each reef. Visual surveys were conducted at stocked sites and control sites on each reef at 3-monthly intervals. Juvenile trochus <25 mm BSW hide within the reef matrix and are found rarely on the upper reef surfaces, so detectable enhancement was expected from 12 mo after release, when they would be at sub-adult size (25 to 50 mm BSW). Abundance estimates of wild sub-adults fluctuated seasonally, and appear related to heat stress; i.e. they tended to be more exposed on the reef surface in periods of higher cloud cover and/or lower temperature. A cyclical trend in the abundance of sub-adult trochus is attributed to seasonal variation in their visibility in censuses. Temporal changes in adult abundance showed no consistent pattern. Due to the lag in detecting stocking of sub-adults and the cyclical nature of population estimates, we tested stocking success using a nonlinear mixed-effects model. From 12 to 18 mo post-release, sub-adults at stocked sites were more abundant (54% increase) compared to control sites. Although statistically significant, the absolute enhancement was small. Variation in the stocking effect among sites underscores the need for multiple sites in restocking. Releases of tiny, cultured trochus juveniles could be used to rebuild nucleus breeding populations for fishery restocking, but improved release methods leading to higher survival of juveniles are needed to make this approach cost-effective.",,,,,"Purcell, Steven/I-2554-2013; Purcell, Steven/AAQ-1326-2021","Purcell, Steven/0000-0002-6227-6454; Purcell, Steven/0000-0002-6227-6454",,,,,,,,,,,,,1864-7790,1864-7782,,,,,2010,9,3,,,,,227,238,,10.3354/ab00253,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ab00253,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000278977700003,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Lecoeur, J; Ney, B",,,,"Lecoeur, J; Ney, B",,,Change with time in potential radiation-use efficiency in field pea,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY,,,,,,,,,,,,"In most crop models, radiation-use efficiency, (RUE) is critical to the calculation of yield. Daily biomass production is usually calculated as the product of intercepted solar radiation and RUE which is assumed to be constant. In this work, field experiments were conducted with field pea (Pisum sativum L.) to assess the stability of RUE during the plant growth cycle, in the absence of biotic and abiotic stresses. Two contrasting locations with regard to solar radiation and air temperature were used in France. At each location, various combinations of years, genotypes, sowing dates and densities were studied. The results demonstrated that RUE is not constant during the plant growth cycle but that a consistent sigmoidal pattern can be defined. During vegetative growth, RUE declined from emergence to a low point before flowering. Once in the reproductive stage, RUE increased to reach a maximum level soon after the beginning of seed filling. Thereafter, it declined to zero upon the death of the plant. The level and timing of change in RUE were affected by sowing date, genotype and plant density. However, the sigmoidal pattern was unaffected by these factors and was not related to air temperature. The specific pattern of RUE probably results from the appearance, growth and subsequent senescence of such plant organs as roots, shoots, leaves, pods and seeds and also changes in those meteorological variables which affect photosynthetic plant capacity. Accurate estimation of RUE is important for the quantification of plant productivity in fluctuating environmental conditions and more mechanistic studies on changes in RUE are needed to investigate the causes of these changes and their consequences for plant productivity.

We extended an existing semiempirical modeling scheme that allows for such quantification. Yield anomalies, measured as interannual differences, were modeled for maize, soybeans, and wheat in the United States and 32 other main producer countries. We used two yield data sets, one derived from reported yields and the other from a global yield data set deduced from remote sensing. We assessed the capacity of the model to forecast yields within the growing season. In the United States, our model can explain at least two-thirds (63%-81%) of observed yield anomalies. Its out-of-sample performance (34%-55%) suggests a robust yield projection capacity when applied to unknown weather. Out-of-sample performance is lower when using remote sensing-derived yield data. The share of weather-driven yield fluctuation varies spatially, and estimated coefficients agree with expectations. Globally, the explained variance in yield anomalies based on the remote sensing data set is similar to the United States (71%-84%). But the out-of-sample performance is lower (15%-42%). The performance discrepancy is likely due to shortcomings of the remote sensing yield data as it diminishes when using reported yield anomalies instead. Our model allows for robust forecasting of yields up to 2months before harvest for several main producer countries. An additional experiment suggests moderate yield losses under mean warming, assuming no major changes in temperature extremes. We conclude that our model can detect weather influences on yield anomalies and project yields with unknown weather. It requires only monthly input data and has a low computational demand. Its within-season yield forecasting capacity provides a basis for practical applications like local adaptation planning. Our study underlines high-quality yield monitoring and statistics as critical prerequisites to guide adaptation under climate change.",,,,,"Gornott, Christoph/ABI-8107-2020","Gornott, Christoph/0000-0003-3933-3358",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,NOV,2017,23,11,,,,,4750,4764,,10.1111/gcb.13738,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13738,,,,,,,,28464336,,,,,WOS:000412322700026,View Full Record in Web of Science

L.",,,Soil nitrogen leaching losses in response to freeze-thaw cycles and pulsed warming in a temperate old field,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Climate warming and increased climate variability are both predicted to increase the frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles in temperate regions. We exposed intact soil-plant mesocosms to freeze-thaw cycles and examined the effects on nitrogen leaching losses. Freezing treatments were performed by incubating the mesocosms in the soil with their tops exposed to air to impose freezing from the top down, such that realistic freezing rates and cycle amplitudes were experienced across the soil profile. Leaching events were then initiated by water addition the following day for both the freezing treatment and control mesocosms. While water addition alone explained the major part of soluble organic nitrogen leaching, nitrate leaching approximately doubled in response to freeze-thaw cycles, and nitrogen leaching remained high after 11 freeze-thaw cycles. In a second experiment, pulses of warming were applied in situ to mesocosms over fall, winter or spring, in order to melt snow, and thereby increase freeze-thaw cycling by exposing soils to diurnal fluctuations in air temperature. Warming pulses had little effect on subsurface soil temperatures and no effect on soil nitrogen leaching. However, warming pulses over spring severely reduced the abundance of the legume Coronilla varia in the following growing season. Overall, the results of these experiments indicate that while increased soil freeze-thaw cycles combined with leaching events are capable of increasing soil nitrogen losses, warming pulses will only promote increased freeze-thaw cycles if they are followed by cold, snow-free weather. The strong effect of warming on the N-fixer C. varia highlights that changes in plant species composition in response to warming may have stronger implications for soil nitrogen dynamics than the direct effects of freeze-thaw cycles on soil nitrogen leaching losses.

After 30 years of experimental warming, carbon stocks in a temperate mixed deciduous forest were observed to be reduced by 30% in the heated plots relative to the controls. In addition, soil respiration was seasonal, as was the warming treatment effect. We therefore hypothesized that long-term warming will have higher expressions of genes related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism due to increased utilization of recalcitrant carbon pools compared to controls. Because of the seasonal effect of soil respiration and the warming treatment, we further hypothesized that these patterns will be seasonal. We used RNA sequencing to show how the microbial community responds to long-term warming (similar to 30 years) in Harvard Forest, MA. Total RNA was extracted from mineral and organic soil types from two treatment plots (+5 degrees C heated and ambient control), at two time points (June and October) and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq technology. Treatment had a larger effect size on KEGG annotated transcripts than on CAZymes, while soil types more strongly affected CAZymes than KEGG annotated transcripts, though effect sizes overall were small. Although, warming showed a small effect on overall CAZymes expression, several carbohydrate-associated enzymes showed increased expression in heated soils (similar to 68% of all differentially expressed transcripts). Further, exploratory analysis using an unconstrained method showed increased abundances of enzymes related to polysaccharide and lipid metabolism and decomposition in heated soils. Compared to long-term warming, we detected a relatively small effect of seasonal variation on community gene expression. Together, these results indicate that the higher carbohydrate degrading potential of bacteria in heated plots can possibly accelerate a self-reinforcing carbon cycle-temperature feedback in a warming climate.",,,,,,"Blanchard, Jeffrey/0000-0002-7310-9678",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-302X,,,,AUG 27,2021,12,,,,,,,,666558,10.3389/fmicb.2021.666558,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.666558,,,,,,,,34512564,,,,,WOS:000761430400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fluctuations in the cellular amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) were detected in GTH4 after the temperature shift, but not in the mutant, GTH4S, which did not die at 26 degrees C presumably due to the lack of genetic factors involved in cell death. The removal of ROS or NO suppressed cell death in GTH4, suggesting that ROS and NO both acted as mediators of cell death. However, excess amounts of the superoxide anion (O-2 center dot-) or NO alleviated cell death. A series of experiments using generators and scavengers of ROS and NO showed that O-2 center dot- affected the cellular levels of NO, and vice versa, indicating that a quantitative balance between O-2 center dot- and NO was important for hybrid cell death. The combination of NO and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was necessary and sufficient to initiate cell death in GTH4 and GTH4S. Hypoxia, which suppressed cell death in GTH4 at 26 degrees C, reduced the generation of H2O2 and NO, but allowed for the production of O-2 center dot-, which acted as a suppressor and/or modulator of cell death. The activation of MAPK was involved in the generation of H2O2 in GTG4 cells under normoxic conditions, but promoted O-2 center dot- generation under hypoxic conditions.

Three types of experiments were undertaken: (i) a field experiment, utilizing the seasonal growth and cessation cycle of a perennial plant; (ii) a cold acclimation experiment in hydroponics; and (iii) an instant freezing test. A specific fluctuation in K+Mg2+-ATPase activity was found throughout the seasonal growth of the plants (i). The K+Mg2+-ATPase activity peaks for both the basal node and the root plasmalemma were determined early in the spring before the renewal of growth. The lowest activity values in roots occurred at the time approaching flowering, and in basal nodes at the transition into the growth cessation. The K+Mg2+-ATPase activity was approximately 50% lower in the basal node plasmalemma of freezing-tolerant plants than of non-tolerant ones, when assessed at the optimal growth stage in hydroponics. In hydroponics (ii) and in the freezing test (iii), temperature stress was followed by a more pronounced change in the level of K+Mg2+-ATPase activity than in that of H+ transport, and this change was more clearly differentiated in the basal node plasmalemma of contrasting genotypes than in the roots. Stress response was manifested differently in freezing-tolerant and non-tolerant plants at cold acclimation (4-2 degrees C) and at freezing (-8 degrees C) temperatures.

The fruit with panicle attached was placed in 11.5 kg commercial perforated plastic basket. The first experiment was carried out to reduce the contact time during dipping and rinsing process by increasing the concentration of HCl. The evaluation of different HCl application techniques showed that dipping in 6.4% HCl (pH 0.03) for 5 min then draining for 10 min without rinsing in water and stored immediately in cold room provided the best compromise between controlling fruit browning and decay and maintaining eating quality. Another experiment was to find out the optimum storage temperatures after dipping in HCl. The fruit placed in four baskets (46 kg in total weight) was dipped in 200 L of 6.4% HCl for 5 min and drained for 10 min. They were stored at 3, 10 and 30 degrees C for 30 days. This treatment was compared with the fruits treated with SO2 treatment. It was found that the fruits treated with HCl and SO2 held at fluctuating temperature (30 degrees C) decayed after five and ten days. Dipping in HCl and storage at 3 degrees C was most suitable to store longan. This condition decreased pericarp browning and disease incidence and maintained consumer acceptance for 30 days; however, SO2 treatment had the highest score for consumer acceptance. There was no significant difference in total soluble solid, titratable acidity and flesh pH in HCl and SO2 treatments during storage. This HCl treatment is a potential tool to control postharvest losses and therefore increase the market life of fresh longans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,978-94-62610-10-1,,,,2014,1024,,,,,,359,366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000343863100049,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over the past two decades, field campaigns and modeling experiments have suggested that tropical atmosphere-ocean interactions may sustain or amplify the pattern of enhanced and suppressed atmospheric convection that defines the MJO and encourage its eastward propagation through the Indian and Pacific Oceans. New observations collected during the past decade have advanced our understanding of the ocean response to atmospheric MJO forcing and the resulting intraseasonal sea surface temperature fluctuations. Numerous modeling studies have revealed a considerable impact of the mean state on MJO ocean-atmosphere coupled processes, as well as the importance of resolving the diurnal cycle of atmosphere-upper ocean interactions. New diagnostic methods provide insight to atmospheric variability and physical processes associated with the MJO but offer limited insight on the role of ocean feedbacks. Consequently, uncertainty remains concerning the role of the ocean in MJO theory. Our understanding of how atmosphere-ocean coupled processes affect the MJO can be improved by collecting observations in poorly sampled regions of MJO activity, assessing oceanic and atmospheric drivers of surface fluxes, improving the representation of upper ocean mixing in coupled model simulations, designing model experiments that minimize mean state differences, and developing diagnostic tools to evaluate the nature and role of coupled ocean-atmosphere processes over the MJO cycle.",,,,,"Klingaman, Nicholas P/H-4610-2012; DeMott, Charlotte/L-7414-2015","Klingaman, Nicholas P/0000-0002-2927-9303; DeMott, Charlotte/0000-0002-3975-1288; Woolnough, Steven/0000-0003-0500-8514",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1944-9208,,,,DEC,2015,53,4,,,,,1099,1154,,10.1002/2014RG000478,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014RG000478,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369157300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of this work was to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in PD expression and release, and in SD induction in these seeds, and the extent to which abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs) are part of these mechanisms. Quantification of endogenous ABA both prior to and during incubation, and sensitivity to ABA and GAs, were assessed in seeds with contrasting dormancy. Expression analysis was performed for candidate genes involved in hormone metabolism and signaling. It was found that endogenous ABA content does not explain either dormancy release or dormancy induction; moreover, it does not seem to play a role in dormancy maintenance. However, dormancy modifications were commonly accompanied by changes in ABA sensitivity. Concomitantly, induction into SD, but not PD, was characterized by a increased PaABI-5 and PaPYL transcription, and a rise in GA sensitivity as a possible counterbalance effect. These results suggest that dormancy cycling in this species is related to changes in embryo sensitivity to ABA; however, this sensitivity appears to be controlled by different molecular mechanisms in primary and secondary dormant seeds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,OCT 7,2020,71,19,,,,,5924,5934,,10.1093/jxb/eraa340,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eraa340,,,,,,,,32706878,,,,,WOS:000577075400019,View Full Record in Web of Science

A.",,,Analysis of carbon and nitrogen dynamics in riparian soils: Model development,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"The quality of riparian soils and their ability to buffer contaminant releases to aquifers and streams are connected intimately to moisture content and nutrient dynamics, in particular of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). A multi-compartment model-named the Riparian Soil Model (RSM)-was developed to help investigate the influence and importance of environmental parameters, climatic factors and management practices on soil ecosystem functioning in riparian areas. The model improves existing tools, in particular regarding its capability to simulate a wide range of temporal scales, from days to centuries, along with its ability to predict the concentration and vertical distribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM). It was found that DOM concentration controls the amount of soil organic matter (SUM) stored in the soil as well as the respiration rate. The moisture content was computed using a detailed water budget approach, assuming that within each time step all the water above field capacity drains to the layer underneath, until it becomes fully saturated. A mass balance approach was also used for nutrient transport, whereas the biogeochemical reaction network was developed as an extension of an existing C and N turnover model. Temperature changes across the soil profile were simulated analytically, assuming periodic temperature changes in the topsoil. To verify the consistency of model predictions and to illustrate its capabilities, a synthetic but realistic soil profile in a deciduous forest was simulated. Model parameters were taken from the literature, and model predictions were consistent with experimental observations for a similar scenario. Modelling results stressed the importance of environmental conditions on SUM cycling in soils. The mineral and organic C and N stocks fluctuate at different time scales in response to oscillations in climatic conditions and vegetation inputs/uptake. (C) 2012 Elsevier By.

Climate variability and socioeconomic factors are the main sources of uncertainty and concern for farmers in this region that has experienced severe drought conditions and problems of competing water demands during the last decades. Within the framework of a European Union project, CLIMB (Climate Induced Changes in the Mediterranean Region), durum wheat production was simulated under future climate change conditions to evaluate the effects of increased maximum temperature and high rainfall variability on crop yield, and the adaptability of the crop response. The first stage of this work was devoted to properly calibrating the AquaCrop model and testing its predictive performance, prior to applying it under future climate change scenarios. Durum wheat (CV Creso) yield and daily meteorological data collected and recorded in the Agris experimental fields during the period 1995-2012 were systematically checked and analyzed before their use for calibration of the AquaCrop model. After calibration the model showed a generally good performance with a significant correlation between observed and simulated yield for durum wheat during the considered period, including the year 1995 that was characterized by a severe drought that led to water stress conditions. A future scenario of climate change was then used as input to the AquaCrop model to predict wheat yield response and to investigate the control of water availability on rainfed crop production for the period 1951-2100. The simulated future scenarios show potential improved productivity arising from the increased CO2 concentration. This encouraging result is however tempered by increased uncertainty and fluctuations in rainfall during the fall and early winter periods (September-December). The possible tradeoffs between these factors, as well as the expected negative effects of increased maximum temperatures, are being further examined. (C) 2013 The Authors.

MPB production was measured for submerged core samples (collected from Daebu mudflat, Korea) at a fixed irradiance and temperature in the laboratory under the conditions of (1) constant light (data-I), (2) light dark incubation (data-II), and (3) in situ reflected (data-Ill). The experimental design aimed to characterize within-day, across-day, and long term changes in MPB production. Our results showed that, under constant light conditions for 72 h, temporal fluctuations in MPB production (day:night = 2.4:1) were clearly present for three consecutive days (data-I), indicating a diel rhythm in production. Production increased at the beginning of light exposure, and dramatically decreased at the time of submersion, indicating tide-dependent rhythm in production. Furthermore, over a 10 d period under the same light and temperature conditions, a weakening (declining) trend in production was observed, which was logarithmic with diel fluctuation (r(2) = 0.995, p < 0.01). This diel rhythm in production was also observed under an alternating light dark (L-14 (h)/D-10 (h)) incubation period across an additional 18 d of measurement (data-II). The decline in production was slower, and more linear (r(2) = 0.930, p < 0.01) under this condition, as the period of dark incubation (D-10 (h)) seemed to allow the community to recover to a certain level of production. Finally, the effects of tidal condition (spring tide vs. neap tide) and biomass (dense vs. lesser dense) on the short-term (<hourly) variability of MPB production (data-Ill) appeared to be negligible when time integrated the production.

Daily changes in the flight activity of aquatic insects have been investigated in only a few water beetles and bugs. The diel flight periodicity of aquatic insects and the environmental factors governing it are poorly understood. 2. We found that primary aquatic insects belonging to 99 taxa (78 Coleoptera, 21 Heteroptera) fly predominantly in mid-morning, and/or around noon and/or at nightfall. There appears to be at least four different types of diurnal flight activity rhythm in aquatic insects, characterised by peak(s): (i) in mid-morning; (ii) in the evening; (iii) both in mid-morning and the evening; (iv) around noon and again in the evening. These activity maxima are quite general and cannot be explained exclusively by daily fluctuations of air temperature, humidity, wind speed and risks of predation, which are all somewhat stochastic. 3. We found experimental evidence that the proportion (%) P(theta) of reflecting surfaces detectable polarotactically as 'water' is always maximal at the lowest (dawn and dusk) and highest (noon) angles of solar elevation (theta) for dark reflectors while P(theta) is maximal at dawn and dusk (low solar elevations) for bright reflectors under clear or partly cloudy skies. 4. From the temporal coincidence between peaks in the diel flight activity of primary aquatic insects and the polarotactic detectability P(theta) of water surfaces we conclude that the optimal times of day for aquatic insects to disperse are the periods of low and high solar elevations theta. The theta-dependent reflection-polarisation patterns, combined with an appropriate air temperature, clearly explain why polarotactic aquatic insects disperse to new habitats in mid-morning, and/or around noon and/or at dusk.

This medusa is also associated with a microbial community that can impact its health, but this community has not been thoroughly studied. Shifts in the bacterial community following the loss of symbionts involving stress, environmental changes, or seasonal fluctuations can be complex, as the role of symbionts in structuring this community is not well established. To understand the interplay among microbial associates with this host, we explored the experimental diminishing of algal symbionts, and the influence of seasonal fluctuations over the structure of the bacterial community, through 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, and Alphaproteobacteria were dominant in all the mucus samples at the beginning of the experiments. However, after 28 days, bleached medusas showed a marked increase in Gammaproteobacteria, specifically in the genus Vibrio, as evidenced by Linear Discriminant Analysis of Effect Size (LEfSe). Seasons also resulted in shifts of the bacterial community, although bacterial genera were distinct from those found in bleached medusas, suggesting temporal associations with the host. According to PERMANOVA analysis, seasonal fluctuations affected the dominant bacterial members (p = 0.07), but symbiont presence was a more significant driver (p=0.001). We found the bacterial community of C. xamachana is like that of other jellyfish and corals, which furthers the interest in this animal as a study model. Defining relevant bacterial genera can help us understand the functional role of the holobiont members that assemble and maintain a healthy microbial community.

Results Based on a whole genome sequence analysis, the new strain FJAT-46737 was identified asBacillus velezensis, and seven gene clusters responsible for the synthesis of bioactive secondary metabolites in FJAT-46737 were predicted. The antimicrobial results demonstrated that FJAT-46737 exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities in vitro against three bacteria and three fungi. Pot experiments showed that the control efficiencies for tomato bacterial wilt of the whole cultures, the 2-fold diluted supernatants and the crude lipopeptide of FJAT-46737 were 66.2%, 82.0%, and 96.2%, respectively. The above results suggested that one of the antagonistic mechanisms of FJAT-46737 was the secretion of lipopeptides consisting of iturins, fengycins and surfactins. The crude lipopeptides had significant antagonistic activities against several pathogens (includingRalstonia solanacearum,Escherichia coliandFusarium oxysporum) and fengycins were the major antibacterial components of the lipopeptides againstR. solanacearumin vitro. Furthermore, the rich organic nitrogen sources (especially yeast extracts) in the media promoted the production of fengycin and surfactin by FJAT-46737. The secretion of these two lipopeptides was related to temperature fluctuations, with the fengycin content decreasing by 96.6% and the surfactins content increasing by 59.9% from 20 degrees C to 40 degrees C.

We quantified the microbial activity in leaf litter (Acer pseudoplatanus) which did not come into contact with isopods, in A. vulgare feces produced from the same litter, and in unconsumed leftover of this litter. Freshly fallen leaf litter and up to 3 day old feces and leftover of litter were used. All materials were air dried immediately after collection and rewetted 1 day before use. Simultaneously, we measured how microbial activity in litter and feces are affected by fluctuations in humidity and temperature and by the addition of easily decomposed substances (starch and glucose). Microbial respiration was lower in feces than in litter or unconsumed leaf fragments. At the same time, moisture and temperature fluctuations and addition of glucose or starch increased respiration much more in litter than in feces. The results indicate that the processing of litter by A. vulgare reduces microbial respiration and reduces the sensitivity of microbial respiration to environmental fluctuations. C-13 NMR spectra from feces indicated preferential loss of polysaccharide-carbon and accumulation of lignin with some modification to the aromatic-carbon. TMAH-Py-GC MS showed that lignin content was higher in feces than in litter and that lignin quality differed between the two substrates. Guaiacyl units were depleted in the feces, which indicated breakdown of guaiacyl associated with gut passage. As a conclusion, the results suggest that this common isopod greatly affects leaf litter decomposition. Decomposition of isopod feces in a long-term experiment is lower than litter decomposition which may support stabilization of organic matter in soil. This is caused mainly due to higher content of aromatic carbon in feces, which may cause its considerable resistance to bacterial degradation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Iran is one of the major centres of almond production, ranking fourth in the world. Negligence towards factors influencing almond production, particularly choosing suitable cultivars, may bring about unrecoverable damages. One of the main problems of almond producers in Iran is the irregular and fluctuating production rates. This is the result of early flowering of native genotypes and coincidence of their flowering times with a cold spring. Under such conditions, chilling or lack of suitable pollination and insemination in the absence of pollen carrying insects at the time of flowering, reduces the total product. This type of damage has been estimated at 60-100% in some years. Thus, implementation of research plans and breeding projects on almond may be one of the best shots at producing cold resistant cultivars that may help counter this problem. An experiment was done on three major commercial cultivars of 'Monagha', variety 12 and variety 18, through a double-factor factorial in the form of random blocks with three replications. Treatments included cultivar at 3 levels, cold factor at 6 levels and phenological phase at 3 levels. Results indicated that the highest rate of ionic leakage in different hours after treatment was achieved at -6 degrees C. in which the leakage was significantly higher than at other temperatures. The lowest leakage was achieved at 4 degrees C, in which the leakage was significantly lower than at other temperatures. Variety 12 was more resistant to cold in comparison to the other two cultivars ('Monagha', variety 8), Comparison of means showed that the lowest leakage rate was achieved in the plant swelling (dormant) phase while the highest one was in the fruit phase. In other words, among phenological phases studied here, the newly formed fruit phase was most sensitive and the swollen phase most resistant to cold.",,,,,"Parvaneh, Tahereh/O-4687-2019; Ebadi, Abdol Ghaffar/AAV-9463-2021","Parvaneh, Tahereh/0000-0003-2711-8394; Ebadi, Abdol Ghaffar/0000-0003-4472-5866",,,,,,,,,,,,,1459-0255,1459-0263,,,,JUL-OCT,2011,9,3-4,1,,,,449,454,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000297447200091,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is difficult to determine the state because the complex hydro-thermo-mechanical interaction usually occurs within the embankments during freezing-thawing processes. To explore the thermo-mechanical stability of embankments in permafrost regions, an in-situ experiment of highway with asphalt pavement was performed firstly. Based on the observed results, a mathematical model was developed to describe the hydro-thermo-mechanical process. Subsequently, the model was validated by the observed data. Finally, the long-term stability of the embankment was analyzed and predicted with a climate warming rate of 0.052 degrees C/a. The results show that, (1) the asphalt pavement heat absorption effect and shady-sunny slope effect reduce the stability of the embankment; (2) the deformation of the embankment demonstrates the periodic freezing-thawing fluctuation and the long-term creep settlement characteristics; (3) the settlement is mainly caused by the freezing-thawing behavior of the active layer, the moving down of the permafrost table, and the warming of permafrost; (4) the shady-sunny slope effect induces the uneven settlement, and the settlement difference increases with operation time. The study will be helpful for the design and maintenance of embankments in permafrost regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Biological responses (e.g. survival) are usually measured with respect to different time reference frames, i.e. at specific chronological times (e.g. at specific dates) or biological times (e.g. at reproduction). Measuring responses on the biological frame is central to understand how environmental fluctuation modifies fitness and population persistence. We use a framework, based on partial differential equations (PDEs) to explore how responses to the time scale and magnitude of fluctuations in environmental variables (= drivers) depend on the choice of reference frame. The PDEs and simulations enabled us to identify different components, responsible for the phenological and eco-physiological effects of each driver on the response. The PDEs also highlight the conditions when the choice of reference frame affects the sensitivity of the response to a driver and the type of join effect of two drivers (additive or interactive) on the response. Experiments highlighted the importance of studying how environmental fluctuations affect biological time keeping mechanisms, to develop mechanistic models. Our main result, that the effect of the environmental fluctuations on the response depends on the scale used to measure time, applies to both field and laboratory conditions. In addition, our approach, applied to experimental conditions, can helps us quantify how biological time mediates the response of organisms to environmental fluctuations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,JUN 21,2022,12,1,,,,,,,10429,10.1038/s41598-022-13603-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-13603-5,,,,,,,,35729311,,,,,WOS:000816855900096,View Full Record in Web of Science

In 1968, initiated by Heinz Ellenberg, an experimental study site was set up on an arable field in the new botanical garden of Gottingen University (Germany). The undisturbed Successions on four plots of a long sere (since 1968/69) and on four additional plots of a shorter sere (since 1982) were evaluated. The seres were classified into stages by cluster analysis, which yield to four Subsequent stages for the long sere and to three Subsequent stages for the short sere. The early succession is characterized by a high proportion of species invasion, whereas with developing time species extinction increased. On all study plots undisturbed Succession directed to the development of pioneer forests. Altogether 247 vascular plant species were recorded. The total species richness shows a fluctuating course during the Successional seres, with significantly increased numbers shortly after Succession has started and a decline in the pioneer-forest stage, when stands age and close down. The primary aim was to compare the characteristics (particular traits) of species occurring at different stages of succession. The majority of the traits concerned exhibited some clear trends in the course of succession. Exclusive reproduction by seeds decreased and the ability for additional vegetative reproduction increased. Anemochorous dispersal significantly decreased, whereas the importance of dispersal by animals, especially endochorous, dominates in the pioneer-forest stage. The mean seed weight significantly increased. During early Succession, plant species staying green over winter dominated, but are of none relevance in the pioneer-forest stage, where summergreen plant species dominate. The change in strategy type features a significant increase of competitive species. The mean Indicator value for light in the herb layer decreased significantly in the pioneer-forest stage.

Aquaponics, combining the technology of recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) and hydroponics in a closed-loop network, could contribute to addressing these problems. Aquaponic systems have lower freshwater demands than agriculture, greater land use efficiency, and decreased environmental impact combined with higher fish productivity. Rainbow trout is one of the major freshwater fish cultured worldwide, which, however, has not yet been commercially developed in aquaponics. Nevertheless, research conducted so far indicates that the trout species represents a good candidate for aquaponics. The impact of climate change on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems tends to become more progressively pronounced and devastating over the years. The sector of aquaculture is severely affected by natural abiotic factors, on account of climate change, that lead to various undesirable phenomena, including aquatic species mortalities and decreased productivity owing to oxidative and thermal stress of the reared organisms. Novel innovative technologies, such as aquaponics that are based on the co-cultivation of freshwater fish with plants in a sustainable manner under the context of controlled abiotic factors, represent a promising tool for mitigating the effect of climate change on reared fish. The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) constitutes one of the major freshwater-reared fish species, contributing to the national economies of numerous countries, and more specifically, to regional development, supporting mountainous areas of low productivity. However, it is highly vulnerable to climate change effects, mainly due to the concrete raceways, in which it is reared, that are constructed on the flow-through of rivers and are, therefore, dependent on water's physical properties. The current review study evaluates the suitability, progress, and challenges of developing innovative and sustainable aquaponic systems to rear rainbow trout in combination with the cultivation of plants. Although not commercially developed to a great extent yet, research has shown that the rainbow trout is a valuable experimental model for aquaponics that may be also commercially exploited in the future. In particular, abiotic factors required in rainbow trout farming along, with the high protein proportion required in the ratios due to the strict carnivorous feeding behavior, result in high nitrate production that can be utilized by plants as a source of nitrogen in an aquaponic system. Intensive farming of rainbow trout in aquaponic systems can be controlled using digital monitoring of the system parameters, mitigating the obstacles originating from extreme temperature fluctuations.",,,,,"Giantsis, Ioannis A./D-4382-2013; Ntinas, Georgios/AAW-1426-2020; Lattos, Athanasios/GZB-6037-2022","Giantsis, Ioannis A./0000-0002-6323-2955; Ntinas, Georgios/0000-0001-5205-9387; Lattos, Athanasios/0000-0002-0773-9604; GEORGOULIS, IOANNIS/0000-0002-9012-8061",,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-2615,,,,,OCT,2022,12,19,,,,,,,2523,10.3390/ani12192523,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12192523,,,,,,,,36230264,,,,,WOS:000866572600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These measurements were conducted over the agricultural station, Hisar, India, during the months of January-February of the year 2017 and 2018. During this period, total five thick fog events and three moderate fog events were captured. The turbulent parameter such as friction velocity, stability, sensible and latent heat fluxes are presented with respect to fog events. During the study period, the western disturbance persists over the north Pakistan and neighborhood region which advects the large amount of moisture into the lower troposphere and further through evaporation. It enforces stable and clear sky atmospheric conditions and reduces the surface temperature leading to the formation of strong surface-based temperature inversion which facilitates the fog formation in the study region.

During 2002-2004 we used bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus to experimentally test the hypothesis that positive effects observed in industrial barrens were due to mechanical sheltering of dwarf shrubs by canopies of birch, Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii. Sheltering by wooden fence during 2 years improved performance and alleviated stress (as indicated by decrease in FA) in bilberry plants growing in open microsites, compared to both the same plants in pre-treatment year and non-sheltered (control) plants. Performance indices of artificially sheltered V myrtillus reached the level observed in plants naturally sheltered by birch canopies. Removal of natural shelter, i.e. cutting of neighbouring birch, caused steady decline in vegetative biomass production, while changes in shoot mass, leaf mass and leaf FA of bilberry were not significant, and performance of these plants during the two post-treatment years remained higher than performance of bilberry in open microsites. Our data indicate that shelter effects to the great extent explain facilitation of dwarf shrubs by top-canopy plants in industrial barrens. Amelioration of unfavourable environment by both natural and artificial shelters was mostly due to protection from wind and extreme soil temperatures.

The length of time required for hypopus physiogenesis (diapause development) is genetically programmed but influenced by environmental factors. This span of time is highly variable, and may extend from one week to more than a year. Spreading out the potential for hypopus completion over time is adaptive, since a pool of hypopodes with prolonged and staggered dormancies serves to spread the risk of emergence of tritonymphs over extended periods of time; it buffers the population against sudden drought to which all other stages of the life-cycle succumb. The additive structure and large variance of the genetic system underlying the length of time required for hypopus physiogenesis allows for the reconstitution of a broad spectrum of genotypes in every generation through the process of meiotic segregation and recombination during sexual reproduction. It favours stored variability, provides a 'fail-safe device' both for survival as well as development in irregularly fluctuating environments, and facilitates the adaptation of populations to local conditions. The trait for hypopus physiogenesis varies independently from that of hypopus formation, and is apparently free to adjust, without genetic constraints, towards an adaptive optimum. The response to selection is fast. Low environmental humidities and high temperatures accelerate physiogenesis of the hypopus. Completion of the hypopus stage and moulting to the tritonymph is triggered by high humidities at moderate temperatures. If environmental conditions preclude moulting, the hypopus following ending of physiogenesis enters a state of quiescence. In contrast the seasonal and largely predictably varying environments, in which essentially anticipatory and season-related token cues like photoperiod regulate the timing of so many arthropod life-cycles, L. destructor copes with sudden and fatal drought, as well as with unheralded and favourable humidities in its ephemeral habitats, mainly by excessive genetic polymorphism in hypopus duration and formation; some genotypes are always instantaneously fit to meet the respective environmental situation. The mite faces gradual food deterioration of its patchily distributed microhabitats by a short-term anticipatory and environmentally cued developmental switch mechanism, which lowers the threshold for hypopus induction. On top of genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity, any genotype x environment interaction provides for increasing flexibility above that from genetic polymorphism and environmental polyphenism alone. This extraordinary measure of adaptedness fits L. destructor for life in irregularly fluctuating environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-8162,,,,,FEB,1991,10,3-4,,,,,231,258,,10.1007/BF01198653,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01198653,,,,,,,,2044432,,,,,WOS:A1991FC87700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the two farmlands, soil organic matter and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen were all significantly decreased, and the rate of decrease were faster in soil depth of 0-10 cm than that in soil depth of 10-20 cm, but soil organic matter and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen in alfalfa grown field was in the following order: slightly salinized plot (S1)>non-saline plot (CK)>moderately salinized plot (S2)>severely salinized plot (S3)>very severely salinized plot (S4); for barley, it was in the following order: CK>S1>S2>S3>S4, and there had different significant difference between different salinized plots under the two farmlands; 2) In growing seasons, different salinization gradient plots had different soil depths of salt accumulation and appearing the peak of average soil ECP under the two crops farmlands. In the composition of soil soluble salt ions and ratio, the same salinized gradient plots between the two crops farmlands were similar; but in alfalfa grown field, the ratios of C1 and Na++K+ in CK and Si were significantly lower than that of CK and S1 in barley grown field, and the change ranges of different ions from CK to S4 were higher than that of barley; 3) In dry matter accumulation and distribution traits, at any given growth stage, along salinization gradient increased, plant total dry matter was more distributed to leaves and roots and center of accumulation and distribution of dry matter in the plant in different salinization gradients was gradually slowly than CK plant. And salt stress made the dry matter partitioning ratio of total shoot of the two crops be gradually reduced and root/shoot ratio increased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0019-5022,,,,,OCT,2014,84,10,,,,,1182,1191,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000343381600005,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Kawamata, S",,,,"Kawamata, S",,,Modelling the feeding rate of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus nudus (A. Agassiz) on kelp,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper presents mathematical models for estimating the amount of kelp eaten by sea urchins Strongylocentrotus nudus (A. Agassiz) using five data sets available from four different research groups or persons who have performed laboratory feeding experiments. These experiments used as food large brown algae, Laminaria spp., Eisenia bicyclis Setchell and Undaria pinnatifida Suringar, which commonly occur in the S. nudus habitats. Non linear regression analysis using three data sets from the experiments with Laminaria fed is carried out to estimate model parameters. Two models are presented for estimating the daily feeding rate. The first model is described as a function of water temperature and test diameter, and the second model is given by multiplying the first model by a seasonal factor that is expressed as a function of day of the year. On the basis of Akaike's information criterion, the second model is selected as a better model for the data given. The model selected predicts that the feeding rate is proportional to the 2.1 power of test diameter; begins to increase at 1 degrees C and reach a maximum at 10 degrees C, beyond which it decreases and finally ceases at 28 degrees C; varying sinusoidally with season by more than 30% of the rate predicted only from temperature and the test diameter. Analysis of the deviations between observed and predicted feeding rates shows that the predicted rates are in good agreement with the observed ones over all factors, on average. Application of the model to feeding rates on kelp species other than Laminaria suggests that the model may also give a reasonably good estimate for the feeding rate for Eisenia bicyclis, but may give a substantial underestimate for Undaria pinnatifida. More detailed analyses of model parameters indicate that the exponent of the feeding rate on test diameter may differ seasonally from the estimate of the model, probably due to reproductive activity. In addition, the analyses suggest that actual feeding rates may change with season, before or after the predicted ones. Despite the presence of unexpected seasonal fluctuations in daily feeding rate, the amount of annual feeding per animal is proportional to about the 2.1 power of test diameter with a very high correlation. The result suggests that daily feeding rates vary with a size-dependent limit in the amount of annual feeding.

Populations of the ecologically important purple urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) have fluctuated widely, most recently with a population boom in the late 1990s, followed by a mass mortality that persists to the present day. Eight general hypotheses have been proposed to account for the urchin decline including cold temperature limiting reproduction, ephemeral algal exudates disrupting urchin fertilization, low larval availability (due to over-harvesting and/or episodic recruitment), high mortality of settlers and juveniles due to hypoxia, hyperoxia, or predation (a trophic cascade hypothesis), and increased mortality due to pathogens (stress hypothesis). The cold-temperature and the trophic cascade hypotheses appear unlikely. The remaining hypotheses, however, all seem to play a role, to some degree, in driving the urchin decline. Ulvoid exudates, for example, significantly reduced urchin fertilization and few larvae were found in plankton tows (2012-2015), indicating low larval availability in summer. Whilst settling urchins regularly recruited under shallow-subtidal rocks until 2011, no settlers were found in these habitats from 2011 to 2014 or in field experiments (2012-2018) using various settlement substrata. Seawater quality was poor in shallow areas of the lough with extreme oxygen fluctuations (diel-cycling hypoxia), and 1-day experimental exposures to DO values < 1 mg L-1 were lethal to most juvenile urchins. Multiple increases of the predatory spiny starfish (Marthasterias glacialis) population in recent decades may also have contributed to the demise of the coexisting juvenile urchins. Finally, urchins of all sizes were seen suffering from dropped spines, tissue necrosis, or white-coloured infection, suggestive of stress-related pathogen mortality. There was a paucity of broken tests, indicating limited predation by large crustaceans; the large number of adult urchins 'missing' and few P. lividus tests on the north shore points to possible urchin removal by poachers and/or starfish predation. While these ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic processes occur on open coast rocky shores, many are exacerbated by the semi-enclosed nature of this fully marine sea lough due to its limited flushing. Multiple factors, including low larval availability and rapidly expanding starfish populations, coupled with degraded habitat quality (ephemeral algal mats and extreme oxygen fluctuations), indicate that the purple urchin populations will not recover without an improvement in the water quality of Lough Hyne Marine Reserve, the restocking of urchins, and protection from poaching.",,,,,,"Cottrell, Dylan/0000-0003-3436-6396; Plowman, Caitlin/0000-0003-2697-2548",,,,,,,,,,,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,OCT 15,2019,226,,,,,,,,106271,10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106271,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.106271,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000482495700032,View Full Record in Web of Science

Broiler Huainan partridge chickens (4 weeks old), fed a diet containing powdered BFRE (0.3 g/kg) for one week, showed significant weight gains compared to the control. Subsequently, the chickens were exposed to low temperatures (15 or 10 degrees C) for one week with or without BFRE addition. After one week of exposure to 15 or 10 degrees C, serum enzymatic activities were recorded. Chickens not receiving BFRE and exposed to 10 degrees C showed a significant decrease in the body weight gain and in serum creatine kinase, lactic dehydrogenase L and alanine aminotransferase activities, whereas the activity of these enzymes changed to a lesser extent in chickens receiving BFRE. However, body weight gains were maintained within the normal range when the ambient temperature was 10 degrees C. In conclusion, BFRE was an effective additive in preventing chickens from losing body weight during cold stress, and in fluctuations in serum enzymatic activity when exposed to cold stress.

We analysed the relationships between precipitation. discharge. water temperature and the emergence of 41 EPT species over 25 years from the Breitenbach. Central Germany. We assumed that the number of emerging individuals does not depend on a single event but was determined particularly by the annual pattern of key variables during larval development in the previous period. Precipitation, discharge and water temperature were tested for variation among years (predictability), predictable persistence (constancy), and predictable fluctuation (contingency). Water temperature had a clear seasonal pattern, precipitation and discharge were rather constant. Precipitation was mediated through the climatic conditions in the catchment into a seasonal discharge pattern. Discharge strongly affected the community. We classified the yearly discharge patterns (1969-1993) into four different groups: (i) permanent 'good flow', (ii) winter and spring spates, (iii) permanent low flow and (iv) floods during 'unusual' periods (non-seasonal)- parterns were discriminated by inean discharge. the yearly sum of the standard deviation of monthly discharge maximum, and the yearly sum of the monthly coefficient of discharge stability (an inverse of the coefficient of variation) within the respective group. The long-term constancy of the EPT populations was determined using the inverse of the coefficient of variation as well. Caddis flies with heavy mineral cases, large stone-flies, and abundant may-flies had stable populations.. Variable populations included fine particle feeders and caddis flies with net spinning larvae or light cases. Site scores (based oil species abundance) in indirect gradient analysis were best associated with groups defined by the discharge pattern in the year before emergence. Years with permanent good flow winter and spring spates, or low flow were ordered along the hori-zontal axis; years with unpredictable (non-seasonal) flow were shifted along the vertical axis. Direct gradient analysis found water temperature, precipitation and discharge in the winter before emergence, and discharge in the Summer of the respective year, and of the year before to influence the EPT emergence. High or low abundance of many species was associated with one of the discharge patterns. Community diversity was highest in years with winter and spring floods, and lowest in years with random floods.

Although many invasive species undergo genetic bottlenecks during introduction to new areas resulting in a loss of genetic diversity, successful invaders manage to flourish in novel environments either because of pre-adaptations or because important traits contain adaptive variation enabling rapid adaptation to changing conditions. To predict and understand invasion success, it is crucial to analyse these features. We assessed the potential of a well-known invader, the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), to expand north of its current range in Europe. A short growing season and harsh overwintering conditions are apparent limiting factors for this species' range. By rearing full-sib families from four geographically distinct populations (Russia, Estonia, Poland, Italy) at two fluctuating temperature regimes, we investigated (a) possible differences in survival, development time, and body size among populations and (b) the amount of adaptive variation within populations in these traits. All populations were able to complete their development in cooler conditions than in their current range. A significant genotype-environment interaction for development time and body size suggests the presence of adaptive genetic variation, indicating potential to adapt to cooler conditions. The northernmost population had the highest survival rates and fastest development times on both temperature regimes, suggesting pre-adaptation to cooler temperatures. Other populations had minor differences in development times. Interestingly, this species lacks the classical trade-off between body size and development time which could have contributed to its invasion potential.

This study aims to estimate the variability in the survival rate of Ae. aegypti, and climate factors that are related to such variability. It is generally assumed that the daily probability of mosquito survival is independent of natural environment conditions and age. To test this assumption, a three-year fieldwork (20052007) and experimental study was conducted at Fortaleza-CE in Brazil with the aim of estimating daily survival rates of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti under natural conditions in an urban city. Survival rates of mosquitoes may be age-dependent and statistical analysis is a sensitive approach for comparing patterns of mosquito survival. We studied whether weather conditions occurring on a particular day influence the mortality observed on that particular day. We therefore focused on the impact of daily meteorological fluctuations around a given climate average, rather than on the influence of climate itself. With regard to survival time, multivariate analyses using the stepwise logistic regression model, adjusted for daily temperature, relative humidity, and saturated vapor pressure deficit (SVPD), suggest that age, the seasonal factor, and the SVPD were the most dependent mortality factors.

Over the last 75 years, the Lake Issaqueena watershed has experienced a drastic shift in land use. This study was conducted to examine the changes in land cover and the implied changes in land use that have occurred and their environmental, water quality impacts. Aerial photography of the watershed (1951, 1956, 1968, 1977, 1989, 1999, 2005, 2006, and 2009) was analyzed and classified using the geographic information system (GIS) software. Seven land cover classes were defined: evergreen, deciduous, bare ground, pasture/grassland, cultivated, and residential/other development. Water quality data, including sampling depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, fecal coliform levels, inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and turbidity, were obtained from the South Carolina (SC) Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) for two stations and analyzed for trends as they relate to land cover change. From 1951 to 2009, the watershed experienced an increase of tree cover and bare ground (+17.4 % evergreen, +62.3 % deciduous, +9.8 % bare ground) and a decrease of pasture/grassland and cultivated land (-42.6 % pasture/grassland and -57.1 % cultivated). From 2005 to 2009, there was an increase of 21.5 % in residential/other development. Sampling depth ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 m. Water temperature fluctuated corresponding to changing air temperatures, and dissolved oxygen content fluctuated as a factor of water temperature. Inorganic nitrogen content was higher from December to April possibly due to application of fertilizers prior to the growing season. Turbidity and fecal coliform bacteria levels remained relatively the same from 1962 to 2005, but a slight decline in pH can be observed at both stations. Prior to 1938, the area consisted of single-crop cotton farms; after 1938, the farms were abandoned, leaving large bare areas with highly eroded soil. Starting in 1938, Clemson reforested almost 30 % of the watershed. Currently, three fourths of the watershed is forestland, with a limited coverage of small farms and residential developments. Monitoring water quality is essential in maintaining adequate freshwater supply. Water quality monitoring focuses mainly on the collection of field data, but current water quality conditions depend on the cumulative impacts of land cover change over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-6369,1573-2959,,,,NOV,2014,186,11,,,,,7617,7630,,10.1007/s10661-014-3953-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3953-9,,,,,,,,25124990,,,,,WOS:000343051400048,View Full Record in Web of Science

A chlorophyll density proxy based on coral pigmentation was derived from multivariate analysis of color data from coral images, and polyps were enumerated to measure colony growth. Among zooxanthellate corals, predicted chlorophyll density exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations that were positively related to temperature, with maxima occurring (luring late summer and early autumn. Pigmentation dynamics in azooxanthellate corals were more variable, although many of these corals displayed temporal fluctuations in pigmentation. Growth also exhibited seasonal fluctuations positively related to temperature, and ceased during the coldest 3 to 4 mo of the year. Corals lost live polyps during the winter as a result of tissue thinning and dormancy, which rendered the colony unable to fend off settling organisms. Although zooxanthellate colonies were able to grow faster than azooxanthellate colonies, coral pigmentation explained only 23 % of the variation in growth rate, emphasizing the importance of heterotrophy as the primary source of nutrition for A. poculata at this northern margin of its range.",,,,,"Dimond, James/AAF-9252-2020","Dimond, James/0000-0003-0255-3111",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,2007,348,,,,,,161,172,,10.3354/meps07050,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps07050,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000251203500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, continuous long-term stem [CO2] studies are scarce, and generally absent in Mediterranean climates. In this study, stem [CO2] was monitored every 15min together with stem and air temperature, sap flow, and soil water storage during a growing season in 16 stems of Quercus pyrenaica to elucidate the main drivers of stem [CO2] at different temporal scales. Fluctuations in sap pH were also assessed during two growing seasons to evaluate potential errors in estimates of the concentration of CO2 dissolved in xylem sap ([CO2*]) calculated using Henry's law. Stem temperature was the best predictor of stem [CO2] and explained more than 90% and 50% of the variability in stem [CO2] at diel and seasonal scales, respectively. Under dry conditions, soil water storage was the main driver of stem [CO2]. Likewise, the first rains after summer drought caused intense stem [CO2] pulses, suggesting enhanced stem and root respiration and increased resistance to radial CO2 diffusion. Sap flow played a secondary role in controlling stem [CO2] variations. We observed night-time sap pH acidification and progressive seasonal alkalinization. Thus, if the annual mean value of sap pH (measured at midday) was assumed to be constant, night-time sap [CO2*] was substantially overestimated (40%), and spring and autumn sap [CO2*] were misestimated by 25%.

Appearance of clouds will therefore alter the surface energy balance and elicit response of plant canopy temperature (T-C). The attenuated shortwave radiation and altered T-C during the presence of clouds may subsequently affect the crop water stress index (CWSI). Therefore, to correctly interpret T-C measurements, the effect of clouds must be understood. The objective of this work was to study the effect of abrupt changes in solar radiation due to varying cloudy conditions on T-C and CWSI for olive trees. Results from two separate experiments are presented, both comparing different levels of water status of Barnea olive trees. The first experiment was conducted in a commercial orchard where five irrigation levels were applied. Thermal images were acquired simultaneously with stomatal resistance measurements on a day with clear skies. The second experiment was conducted on single trees planted in lysimeters. Irrigation was withheld for five of 15 trees for 6 days until they were severely stressed. Thereafter, irrigation was resumed to levels higher than the transpiration rates. Throughout the stress and recovery periods, water status measurements were conducted daily between 12:00 and 14:00 on all trees. On the day of maximum stress, thermal images of well-watered and stressed trees were acquired every minute throughout a time sequence during which large fluctuations in radiation due to cloud cover were observed. The most pronounced result of this study was the greater response of stressed, compared to well-watered, trees to abrupt changes in radiation intensity. When solar radiation was high, the CWSI of stressed trees reached 0.8, while the CWSI of well-watered trees was near 0. When solar radiation dropped due to clouds, the CWSI of the stressed trees decreased to approximate to 0.3, while that of well-watered trees continued to fluctuate around 0.

We develop and test a mathematical model for predicting the effects of low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) on growth, reproduction, and survival using laboratory experiments on fish and shrimp. The exposure-effects model simulates the hourly reductions in growth and survival, and the reduction in reproduction (fecundity) at times of spawning, of an individual as it is exposed to constant or hourly fluctuating dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. The model was applied to seven experiments involving fish and shrimp that included constant and fluctuating DO exposures, with constant exposures used for parameter estimation and the model then used to simulate the growth, reproduction, and survival in the fluctuating treatments. Cumulative effects on growth, reproduction, and survival were predicted well by the model, but the model did not replay the observed episodic low survival days. Further investigation should involve the role of acclimation, possible inclusion of repair effects in reproduction and survival, and the sensitivity of model predictions to the shape of the immediate effects function.

R.; Bhardwaj, Anshuman; Sam, Lydia; Weaver, Russell C.; Butler, David R.",,,Local- and Regional-Scale Forcing of Glacier Mass Balance Changes in the Swiss Alps,REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Glacier mass variations are climate indicators. Therefore, it is essential to examine both winter and summer mass balance variability over a long period of time to address climate-related ice mass fluctuations. In this study, we analyze glacier mass balance components and hypsometric characteristics with respect to their interactions with local meteorological variables and remote large-scale atmospheric and oceanic patterns. The results show that all selected glaciers have lost their equilibrium condition in recent decades, with persistent negative annual mass balance trends and decreasing accumulation area ratios (AARs), accompanied by increasing air temperatures of >= +0.45 degrees C decade(-1). The controlling factor of annual mass balance is mainly attributed to summer mass losses, which are correlated with (warming) June to September air temperatures. In addition, the interannual variability of summer and winter mass balances is primarily associated to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Greenland Blocking Index (GBI), and East Atlantic (EA) teleconnections. Although climate parameters are playing a significant role in determining the glacier mass balance in the region, the observed correlations and mass balance trends are in agreement with the hypsometric distribution and morphology of the glaciers. The analysis of decadal frontal retreat using Landsat images from 1984 to 2014 also supports the findings of this research, highlighting the impact of lake formation at terminus areas on rapid glacier retreat and mass loss in the Swiss Alps.",,,,,"Gharehchahi, saeideh/AAH-9403-2021","Gharehchahi, saeideh/0000-0001-7912-4484; Ballinger, Thomas/0000-0002-8722-1927; Bhardwaj, Anshuman/0000-0002-2502-6384",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2072-4292,,,,MAY,2021,13,10,,,,,,,1949,10.3390/rs13101949,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13101949,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000662519200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to evaluate the use of pressure algometry for objectively quantifying the effect of diagnostic palpation applied by physiotherapists on the musculoskeletal function of the equine neck and back. The inter-examiner repeatability of animal physiotherapists was tested, and their subjective clinical scores for the vertebral column area were objectively compared with MNT values measured at the same locations to investigate the potential clinical implementation of the pressure algometer in daily equine rehabilitation practice. Six adult Dutch Warmblood riding school mares were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The MNT of all horses was measured on 35 pre-defined sites on the vertebral column in the morning and in the evening of the same day. In the experimental group (n = 3), neck and back surface temperature, pain, muscle tone, and passive mobility were scored through palpation by three certified physiotherapists and related to MNT measurements at the same vertebral column locations. Agreement between the physiotherapists was determined from Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (P<.05). These correlation coefficients showed a significant agreement between the scores of individual physiotherapists and with objective MNT measurements. The three physiotherapists agreed best in their subjective gradings of pain, but less for temperature and muscle tone, and least for mobility. There was also a significant difference in MNT between individual horses. The physiotherapeutic diagnostic intervention did not significantly alter the MNT of the experimental group compared with the control group. There was a significant difference, however, between morning (7.4 kg/cm(2)) and evening (6.9 kg/cm(2)) MNT-measurements within the combined group (n = 6, P<.05). In conclusion, a pressure algometer proved to be a useful tool to objectively monitor the palpation of individual Warmbloods by individual physiotherapists. The correlation of their scores to the objective MNT measurements elucidated that there were differences on which scale (pain, temperature, muscle tone, mobility) they merely relied upon in their palpation. Significant effects of physiotherapeutic diagnostic palpation on MNT, however, were not found. The lower MNT of the horses at the second trial in the evening could be a sensitization of the measurement location because of bruising, a learning effect of the horses, or a diurnal fluctuation. The use of pressure algometry has both a potential to quantify clinical neck and back musculoskeletal sensitivity in horses possibly leading to dysfunction, as veil as to objectively evaluate treatment results. Repeated measurements on the same day and on the same location along the vertebral column may influence absolute MNT values. The algometer can be used with success provided that the operator has proper and frequent training.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0737-0806,1542-7412,,,,JUN,2010,30,6,,,,,310,321,,10.1016/j.jevs.2010.04.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2010.04.010,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000279384600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nymphal survival and development were assessed on pods stored under cocoa canopy, whereas female survival and fecundity were evaluated on sleeved pods in cocoa trees. At the same time, cocoa phenology and cocoa canopy microclimate were characterized. A life table analysis was conducted with survival and fecundity temporal data. Reproductive parameters showed far more variation than nymphal development parameters, both within and among generations. We obtained low intrinsic rates of natural increase (about 0.04), the variation of which was mainly linked to the decrease in fecundity. Fecundity as well as life table parameters varied in accordance with natural population fluctuations, suggesting that S. singularis seasonal variation might be mainly linked to variation in female fecundity. A multiple regression analysis showed that variation in female fecundity was first correlated with the presence of young fruits on cocoa trees.

Assessing whether these populations can cope with recent increases in climate extremes and variability can better inform conservation efforts.We investigated the effects of climate deviations and fire on the population dynamics of the lizard Tropidurus torquatus in the Cerrado of Brazil. We decomposed six climate variables into seasonal and non-seasonal components and assessed which factors, along with long- and short-term effects of fire, better accounted for variation in the survival and recruitment of a T. torquatus population monitored for 12 years. Survival was not associated with climate seasonality, and instead minor fluctuations were related to temperature extremes. Recruitment benefited from long-term fire effects and had a strong seasonal component accounting for most of the variation in the population. Climate deviations caused severe changes in the number of recruits each year, with an overall negative effect on population growth. Population growth was more sensitive to recruitment than to survival, resulting in a sharp population decline over the study period.

Previously, most of the traditional methods for ammonia emission measurement collected atmospheric ammonia by an acid absorbent. However, these techniques were labor intensive, making it difficult to determine diurnal variation of ammonia volatilization. The open-path tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy is a reliable tool with high precision, high selectivity, and fast response time for continuous and nonintrusive monitoring of ammonia concentrations over distances from tens to hundreds of meters under field conditions. Currently, the combination of tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy and micrometeorological backward Lagrangian stochastic diffusion model (TDLAS-BLS) has become a popular technique in the measurement of ammonia volatilization in the field. The objectives of the study are first, to compare TDLAS-BLS technique with the micrometeorological integrated horizontal flux method for its accuracy and applicability for quantitatively measuring ammonia emission from large area of farmland through field experiments. Second, determine the dynamics of ammonia volatilization via high-temporal resolution data and identify the factors that govern ammonia volatilization from urea applied to winter wheat. The results indicated that the estimates made by TDLAS-BLS method were statistically equivalent to those made by the IHF method (regression gradient= 0. 97, R-2 =0. 97, n=14). The ammonia emission rates and total ammonia loss estimated by the TDLAS-BLS technique were only 3%0 and 6%0 lower than those from the IHF method, respectively. This implied that TDLAS-BLS technique can be used to quantitatively estimate ammonia emission from large area of farmland during topdressing period of winter wheat with acceptable accuracy. Ammonia concentration was higher in daytime than in the night at topdressing stage of winter wheat, due to wind speed fluctuation causing it to fluctuate greatly. Ammonia volatilization rate increased slowly after fertilization, and reached a maximum value at the sixth day after fertilization and then decreased gradually after 15 days. This was mainly concentrated in the 5 similar to 8 days after fertilization, and accounted for 69% of the total during the overall monitoring period. During this period, the total loss determined by TDLAS-BLS method was 8. 8 kg N . ha(-1) (6. 3% of the total applied N). The lower loss was related due to furrow application of urea and low temperature. This demonstrated the ability of the TDLAS-BLS method to characterize the diurnal patterns of ammonia emission and the environmental influences on ammonia emission from cropland via high-temporal resolution data. Ammonia volatilization showed large diurnal variability during the daytime, which was coincident with temperature, wind speed and solar radiation. Wind speed, solar radiation, soil temperature and precipitation are significantly correlated with ammonia volatilization. Meteorological factor (such as precipitation) are the main factors influencing ammonia volatilization in abnormal weather.",,,,,"zhang, xian/GYA-0290-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-0593,,,,,MAR,2020,40,3,,,,,885,890,,10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2020)03-0885-06,http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2020)03-0885-06,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000528837900038,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, detailed investigations of conditions experienced by intertidal organisms during winter and how they respond to them are scarce. We intensively sampled two intertidal mudflats in the upper Bay of Fundy, Canada, over two consecutive winters (December to March, 2009-2011), to quantify winter abiotic conditions and the response of the burrow-dwelling amphipod Corophium volutator. Substantial ice cover (both crust and drift ice) was present for a short time, followed by sometimes severe ice scouring. Sediment temperature, 5 cm deep, reached and remained at similar to -2 degrees C during the coldest month (February), while it fluctuated more near the surface throughout the winter. Density of C volutator declined in a linear manner overtime, with a mortality rate of 15-28 ind.m(-2)d(-1), and did not correlate with harsh winter events (cold snaps, ice break-up). Individual growth rate was low (0.003 mm d(-1) or less in body length), and population structure (proportion of juveniles, adult sex ratio) remained fairly constant. We also tested hypotheses concerning adaptations used by C volutator to survive winter. Amphipods did not shift to deeper layers in the sediment in response to cold; in fact, about 80% of the population was found in the top 1.5 cm, where temperatures are coldest and most variable. C volutator survived short-term (48 h) severe cold temperatures (-8 degrees C), and can survive 2 weeks or more at -3 degrees C. We concluded that C volutator survives winter through its physiological adaptations. We hypothesize that accumulated thermal stress or depletion of energy reserves are the most likely cause of mortality during winter in C volutator and possibly other intertidal infauna.

Although the underlying causes of this wide variability are not well understood, the abundance of M. magister megalopae has been linked to recruitment into the adult fishery 4 years later. These pelagic megalopae are exposed to a range of ocean conditions during their dispersal period, which may drive their occurrence patterns. Environmental exposure history has been found to be important for some pelagic organisms, so we hypothesized that inclusion of recent environmental exposure history would improve our ability to predict inter-annual variability in M. magister megalopae occurrence patterns compared to using in situ conditions alone. We combined 8 years of local observations of M. magister megalopae and regional simulations of ocean conditions to model megalopae occurrence using a generalized linear model (GLM) framework. The modeled ocean conditions were extracted from JISAO's Seasonal Coastal Ocean Prediction of the Ecosystem (J-SCOPE), a high-resolution coupled physical-biogeochemical model. The analysis included variables from J-SCOPE identified in the literature as important for larval crab occurrence: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, nitrate concentration, phytoplankton concentration, pH, aragonite, and calcite saturation state. GLMs were developed with either in situ ocean conditions or environmental exposure histories generated using particle tracking experiments. We found that inclusion of exposure history improved the ability of the GLMs to predict megalopae occurrence 98% of the time. Of the six swimming behaviors used to simulate megalopae dispersal, five behaviors generated GLMs with superior fits to the observations, so a biological ensemble of these models was constructed. When the biological ensemble was used for forecasting, the model showed skill in predicting megalopae occurrence (AUC = 0.94). Our results highlight the importance of including exposure history in larval occurrence modeling and help provide a method for predicting pelagic megalopae occurrence.

The alongshore pressure gradient, calculated independently from a linear coastal-trapped wave model, is included as an external ''forcing''. The extended model has been used to simulate the temperature and velocity fields observed during the Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment 2 (CODE 2) in the spring and summer of 1982 on the Northern California Continental Shelf. The results were compared to the CODE 2 observations and to the results of the purely two-dimensional and coastal trapped wave models. Results using the extended model show some improvement in the cross-shore and alongshore velocity fluctuations. The differences between the models are explained in terms of the opposition between the wind stress and the pressure gradient in the alongshore direction, which reduces the magnitude of the alongshore velocity. The reduced magnitude of the alongshore flow decreases the alongshore bottom stress which, in turn, reduces the offshore transport in the bottom boundary layer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,AUG 15,1994,99,C8,,,,,16117,16129,,10.1029/94JC01116,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94JC01116,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PC01800013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Field experiments were conducted using the Yangmai-13 (vernal type) and Yannong-19 (semi-winter type) winter wheat cultivars to investigate the effects of night-warming during winter (warming by 1.47-1.53 degrees C from tillering to jointing), spring (warming by 1.68-1.77 degrees C from jointing to booting), and winter + spring (warming by 1.53-1.60 degrees C from tillering to booting) on plant growth and N utilization in 2014-2016. The results showed that the grain yield, N agronomic efficiency (NAE), and N recovery efficiency (NRE) of both cultivars were highly increased in response to night-warming, which were associated with enhanced dry matter and N accumulation, and winter + spring night-warming resulted in greater increases than winter night-warming and spring night-warming. Furthermore, the increase in pre-anthesis N accumulation was much higher than after anthesis, resulting in a greater increase in post-anthesis dry matter accumulation due to more leaf N distribution at anthesis to support photosynthetic production. Root growth characteristics (i.e., root length, surface area and volume, and root bleeding intensity) were significantly promoted, which favored plant N uptake. Soil urease and protease activity as well as the net N mineralization rate, which are involved in soil N supply capacity, were increased, whereas soil inorganic N content and apparent N surplus were clearly decreased, which indicated that plant N uptake capacity was highly improved in response to night-warming conditions.

Objectives were to (1) evaluate the separate and interactive relationship of TOC, MBC, MBN, DOC, and DON with soil CO2 flux, in addition to the relationship obtained by environmental variables (soil temperature and moisture), and (2) investigate the seasonal and annual CO2 fluxes from different land uses. Annual CO2 fluxes ranged from 5.4 to 9.5 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1). Vegetable field had the highest CO2 emission, while pine forest had significantly lower CO2 emission than cultivated land uses. Different quantities of MBC and MBN significantly regulated the CO2 emission among different land uses, relatively weakly correlated with DOC, while not being correlated with DON. However, temporal fluctuations of CO2 flux were significantly regulated by MBC, MBN, DOC and DON, in one model of variation, in all land uses. But, when all the variables were included in the multiple stepwise regression analysis, different trend of dominancy was observed for soil temperature (two sites), MBC (one site), MBN (one site), DOC (two sites) and DON (one site). Our results indicate that (1) there can be a significant shift of microbial biomass with land-use change, which in turn, caused to shift in CO2 flux, and (2) apart from the soil temperature, microbial biomass and dissolved organic substances must be considered in a warming future as these can explain a major part of temporal variation of soil CO2 fluxes.

A detailed comparison of the inertial-dissipation fluxes with the direct covariance method is given, using data from the Humidity Exchange Over the Sea (HEXOS) main experiment, HEXMAX. In this experiment, inertial-dissipation packages were deployed at the end of a 17 m boom, in a region relatively free of flow distortion; and on a mast 7 m above the platform (26 m above the sea surface) in a region of considerable flow distortion. An error analysis of the inertial-dissipation method indicates that stress is most accurately measured in near-neutral conditions, whereas scalar fluxes are most accurately measured in near-neutral and unstable conditions. It is also shown that the inertial-dissipation stress estimates are much less affected by the flow distortion caused by the platform as well as by the boom itself. The inertial-dissipation (boom and mast) and boom covariance estimates of stress agree within +/- 20%. The latent heat flux estimates agree within approximately +/- 45%. The sensible heat flux estimates agree within +/- 26% after correction for velocity contamination of the sonic temperature spectra. The larger uncertainty in the latent heat fluxes is due to poor performance of our Lyman-alpha hygrometers in the sea spray environment. Improved parameterizations for the stability dependence of the dimensionless humidity and temperature structure functions are given. These functions are used to find a best fit for effective Kolmogorov constants of 0.55 for velocity (assuming a balance of production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy) and 0.79 for temperature and humidity. A Kolmogorov constant of 0.51 implies a production-dissipation imbalance of approximately 12% in unstable conditions.",,,,,"fairall, christopher/G-5970-2019; Mestayer, Patrice G./AAF-4346-2020","fairall, christopher/0000-0003-4073-7413; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,JUN 15,1991,96,C6,,,,,10689,10711,,10.1029/91JC00886,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JC00886,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991FT34300020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Culturing bacteria with strong shaking and continuous shaking provided suitable culture conditions to obtain higher bacterial yields without aggregation and fluctuation, contrary to most other treatments that showed a huge amount of bacterial aggregates. A prolonged bath method for 24h, without skin or gill scarification, was considered suitable for disease induction with high mortality rates.

Spectral analyses of reconstructed SST and seawater delta O-18 time series revealed East Asia monsoon (EAM) and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variations.

From geochemical records of fossil corals in Okinawa, Japan, we first reconstructed a >50-year-long bimonthly time series of sea surface temperature and seawater oxygen isotope ratios (relating to salinity) during the middle Holocene. The high-resolution climate proxy records clearly showed seasonal-, interannual-, and decade-scale thermal and hydrologic variations. Our data demonstrate that the mean climate state around Okinawa was slightly cooler and saline during the middle Holocene than it is today. It is particularly interesting that we can provide robust evidence for (slightly) greater influence of the East Asian winter (summer) monsoon variability on the northwestern subtropical Pacific sea surface at that time.

Using Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS), acquiring turbulent temperature fluctuations at high temporal and spatial frequencies, we computed convection velocities across wave numbers using a phase spectrum method. We found that convection velocity decreases as k(-1/3) at the higher wave numbers of the inertial subrange instead of being independent of wave number as suggested by Taylor's hypothesis. We further corroborated this result using large eddy simulations. Applying Taylor's hypothesis thus systematically underestimates turbulent spectrum in the inertial subrange.

Based on the Budyko equation, this study performed an analytical derivation of the climatic elasticity of evapotranspiration (ET). With this derived elasticity, it is possible to quantitatively separate the impacts of precipitation, air temperature, net radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed on ET in a watershed. This method was applied in the Wuding River Watershed (WRW), located in the center of the Yellow River Watershed of China. The estimated rate of change in ET caused by climatic variables is -10.69 mm/decade, which is close to the rate of change in ET (-8.06 mm/decade) derived from observable data. The accurate estimation with the elasticity method demonstrates its reliability. Our analysis shows that ET in the WRW had a significant downward trend, but the ET ratio in the WRW has increased continually over the past 52 years. Decreasing precipitation is the first-order cause for the reduction of ET, and decreasing net radiation is the secondary cause. Weakening wind speed also contributed to this reduction. In contrast, regional warming led to an increase in ET that partly offset the negative contributions from other climatic variables. Moreover, reforestation can affect the energy budget of a watershed by decreasing albedo, compensating for the negative influence of global dimming. The integrated effect from precipitation and temperature can affect the energy budget of a watershed by causing a large fluctuation in winter albedo.",,,,,"Niu, Guo-Yue/B-8317-2011","Niu, Guo-Yue/0000-0003-2105-7690; Jin, Jiming/0000-0002-0075-7738; Tian, Lei/0000-0001-9117-437X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2071-1050,,,,DEC,2018,10,12,,,,,,,4589,10.3390/su10124589,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10124589,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000455338100255,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the stranding of salmonid fry is one documented effect of hydropeaking, little is known about the species-specific behavioural and subsequent growth effects of sub-daily flow fluctuations. We investigated the effects of sub-daily flow fluctuation on growth, mortality and behaviour of sympatric Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S. trutta) fry (29-34 mm) in a laboratory experiment. The fluctuating flow treatment negatively affected growth and increased mortality for trout but not for salmon. The level of aggressive behaviour was similar in the fluctuating- and stable-flow treatments. Within the fluctuating flow treatment, there was a trend that more fishes were visibly active above the substrate during low than high flow. These findings suggest that hydropeaking-induced flow fluctuations may affect fry of different salmonid species in different ways and that brown trout fry may be more vulnerable to hydropeaking effects than Atlantic salmon fry.

In most simulation models, it is calculated every day by multiplying the amount of carbohydrate available to leaves by specific leaf area (SLA). However, leaf expansion rate is considerably reduced by mild water deficits which do not affect photosynthesis, and is not affected by a reduction in the PPFD intercepted during rapid leaf expansion. Specific leaf area undergoes a several-fold variability depending on PPFD, soil water status and time of day. It is increased when environmental conditions have a greater depressive effect on expansion rate than on photosynthesis, and is decreased in the opposite case. It is therefore appropriate to model leaf expansion independently of the plant carbon budget. Consistent characteristics can be deduced from a series of experiments, allowing a model of leaf expansion to be proposed. (i) Time courses of relative leaf expansion rate and of epidermal cell division rate are well conserved within a plant and across a large range of environmental conditions, provided that durations and rates are expressed in thermal time. Maximum relative rates are common to all zones of a leaf and to all leaves of a plant, in maize and sunflower. (ii) A water deficit, or a reduction in intercepted PPFD, imposed in the first half of the period of leaf development affects the relative expansion rate in the deficit only, but permanently affects the absolute expansion rate. In contrast, a reduction in PPFD causes no effect on leaf expansion if imposed in the rapid expansion period when the leaf is autotrophic. (iii) Expansion rate is related to evaporative demand and to the concentration of ABA in the xylem sap with relationships that apply under both field and laboratory conditions.

The results showed that the catalytic activity at different temperatures and pH, thermostability, and tolerance to organic solvents of all modified lipases were improved. The composition and configuration of modifiers have great influence on the catalytic performance of the modified lipases. AAILs composed of L-proline exhibited better modification effect than those containing D-proline. The use of [N-AC-L-Pro] [Cl] led to the highest modification degree (47.92 %) of the lipase, which exhibited the highest hydrolytic activity (430.67 U/ g), as well as enhanced thermal stability and tolerance to organic solvents. The structure of CALB was characterized by circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. It was found that the introduction of a modifier changes the secondary structure of CALB to a certain extent, and the microenvironment around the fluorescent group changed slightly. The structural stability of CALB modified with [N-AC-L-Pro] [Cl] and the mechanism of reaction were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular dynamics simulations of the native and modified CALB were performed for 20 ns at 300 and 328 K. The simulation results showed that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and total energy of modified CALB were less than those of native CALB, indicating a more stable structure for the modified CALB. The root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) calculations showed that the rigidity of the modified CALB and the flexibility of the active center region were both enhanced. The solvent accessibility area (SASA) calculations showed that both hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the modified enzyme-protein were improved. The increase in radial distribution function (RDF) of water molecules confirmed that the number of water molecules around the active sites was also increased. Thus, the modified CALB has enhanced structural stability and higher hydrolytic activity towards the triglyceride substrates.",,,,,,"Xu, Chao/0000-0002-7678-3641",,,,,,,,,,,,,2468-8231,,,,,FEB,2021,501,,,,,,,,111355,10.1016/j.mcat.2020.111355,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcat.2020.111355,,JAN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000612342900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The simulation allows us to investigate collective foraging decisions in a variety of experimental setups that can be reproduced experimentally with real bees. Because our model allows us to project the daily net honey gain of the simulated honey bee colony, it enables us to explore the economic results of foraging decisions, even in a fluctuating environment.

We investigated whether the pH/carbonate chemistry of extremely cold polar waters can be manipulated in an ecologically relevant way, to represent conditions under future atmospheric CO2 levels, in an in-situ FOCE experiment in Antarctica. We examined spatial and temporal variation in local ambient carbonate chemistry at hourly intervals at two sites between December and February and compared these with experimental conditions. We successfully maintained a mean pH offset in acidified benthic chambers of -0.38 (+/- 0.07) from ambient for approximately 8 weeks. Local diel and seasonal fluctuations in ambient pH were duplicated in the FOCE system. Large temporal variability in acidified chambers resulted from system stoppages. The mean pH, Omega(arag) and fCO(2) values in the acidified chambers were 7.688 +/- 0.079, 0.62 +/- 0.13 and 912 +/- 150 mu atm, respectively. Variation in ambient pH appeared to be mainly driven by salinity and biological production and ranged from 8.019 to 8.192 with significant spatio-temporal variation.

The turbulent kinetic energy, its spectral consumption (dissipation) and the dispersion of turbulent fluctuations of temperature and contaminant are from the EARS model that minimizes difficulties in simulating the turbulent transport in a stably stratified environment and reduces efforts needed for the numerical modeling. Numerical simulation of the turbulent structure of the penetrative convection over the urban heat island under the stably stratified atmosphere demonstrates that the EARS model is able to predict the thermal circulation induced by the heat island in accordance with the experimental data. The model describes such the thin physical effects, as a crossing of vertical profiles of temperature of a thermal plume with the formation of the negative buoyancy area testifying to development of the domeshaped form at the top part of a plume in the form of hat. Combined effects of terrain orography and thermal stratification on dispersion of pollutants in an urban heat island are numerically simulated.

This article presents the 5-y time trend of soil and surface water quality observed in a drainage experiment conducted in a black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) peatland of eastern Quebec, Canada, using the paired watershed approach. Nutrient content of peat soil water was enhanced by drainage. The effect was generally proportional to ditch closeness for S and Mg, while increases of N, Na, K and Ca were mainly observed within 5 m of the ditches, even though high levels of K and Ca were occasionally observed at 15-m distance. Drainage increased and sustained summer low flows by 25% through a 80 m(3) d(-1) increase of base flow on the 8 ha basin. The concentration of suspended sediments significantly increased and exceeded acceptable limits For aquatic organisms only during ditching and during the peak Rows of the following weeks. No effect on suspended sediments was detected during the spring following ditching but an increase was observed during a storm 2 y after ditching. Drainage modified the basin outflow temperature fluctuations by lowering the average weekly minimum and increasing the maximum, by 2 degrees C and 7 degrees C, respectively. Water temperature increases to 25 degrees C or more at the outlet of the drained basin were above the preferred range for brook trout. The treatment significantly increased specific conductivity of surface water, which was clearly related to increases in mineral N (NH4 + NOx), Ca, Mg, Na and S concentrations. However, conductivity and the increased nutrient concentrations remained within the acceptable criteria for aquatic organisms. Drainage also produced a pH increase of one unit, a result attributed to increased runoff from the upland part of the treated watershed. No effect related to drainage was found for Zn, Fe and Al contents. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the treeline species composition and the pace of its upward migration can be mediated by ecological interactions. In particular, so-called ecosystem engineers, i.e. species that modulate the microscale environmental conditions, at the treeline may play a crucial role. We conducted a three-year seedling transplant experiment at the alpine treeline ecotone in southwest China to study how the shrub Rhododendron rupicola modifies the microscale physical and biotic environments and thus influences the establishment and performance of the two treeline species Larix potaninii and Picea likiangensis. Seedlings were transplanted to the current timberline and treeline, as well as above the current treeline in order to determine the responses of the two tree species to the shrub with respect to the current tree distribution. R. rupicola modified the microenvironment by increasing soil moisture and nutrient contents, buffering soil temperature fluctuations, and by increasing richness and changing the composition of root-associated fungi. As a result, tree seedlings planted under shrubs had significantly higher survival, growth rates and nutrient accumulations than those planted in open ground. Furthermore, seedlings planted at lower elevations performed better than those planted at higher elevations. Beyond the treeline, seedling survival was very low on open ground but strongly facilitated by the shrub. Finally, facilitation effects were species-specific, with Larix benefitting more from the shrub than Picea, while Picea had less mortality than Larix in the absence of the shrub. This study demonstrates that shrubs, through the amelioration of physical and biotic microenvironmental conditions, can act as stepping stones for the establishment of selective tree species beyond the current treeline. This suggests that biotic interactions can strongly modify the treeline species composition and push the treeline beyond its current climatic limits, thereby facilitating the upward shift with ongoing climate warming.

This often coincides with abdominal distension syndrome, which is associated with osmoregulatory stress and lipid indigestion. The present study investigated combined effects of water stability in extruded feeds and fluctuating water salinity on feed consumption, growth, nutrient digestibility, gastrointestinal transit, and accumulation of water and oil in the stomach of rainbow trout. Diets were produced with high or low water stability, which were characterised by a novel water stability test. In an initial 84 days growth experiment, each diet was fed to six groups of 772 g trout, of which three tanks were supplied with full-strength seawater, and three tanks were fluctuated between seawater and freshwater (7 h per day during 3 successive days per week). No significant effects were seen, although the feed intake appeared slightly lowered by low dietary water stability at fluctuating salinity. In a second experiment, each diet was fed to four groups of 1 kg trout, of which two tanks were supplied with full-strength seawater, and two tanks were fluctuated between seawater and brackish water (17 parts per thousand 7 h per day daily). Low water stability of the diet resulted in accumulation of oil in the stomach, and this response was worsened when the salinity of the rearing water fluctuated. It also corresponded with reduced lipid digestibility. Consequently, low water stability of the diet caused an oil separation in the stomach that may result in oil-belching in rainbow trout suffering from osmoregulatory stress. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The study includes measurements of diel patterns of CO2 exchange and transpiration, and of fluctuations in organic acid levels, PEP carboxylase properties and water relations. In contrast to the other Kalanchoe species studied so far, the CAM behaviour of K. beharensis is very uniform. Regardless of whether the plants were naturally droughted for several months or had received 6 wk of daily watering, CO2 uptake was quantitatively the same and occurred entirely during the night. Watering also had no effect on the amplitude of the diel fluctuation of titratable acidity. The fluctuating citrate level was somewhat higher in the droughted plants. The data on PEP carboxylase indicate a diel change between an active night-form and a less active day-form of the enzyme known already from other CAM plants studied in the laboratory. Experiments with leaves kept in situ artificially darkened during the day revealed that the onset of deacidification was under the control of an external stimulus, presumably of temperature. In the CAM performing leaves, neither water status nor seasons were associated with significant differences in leaf water potential, osmotic pressure and turgor pressure. The lower amplitude of titratable acidity found during the dry season is presumably more due to suboptimal night temperatures during this time than to plant water relations. Altogether, the study shows that K. beharensis is capable of maintaining the full CAM performance throughout the entire arid seasons, and thus avoids CAM idling. It is assumed that this advantageous behaviour is based on the capability to maintain appropriate water status in the photosynthetically active leaves even during long-lasting drought. This capability is due, on the one hand, to minimization of transpiration by the extreme CAM mode, accompanied by very low cuticular transpiration, and on the other hand due to water transfer from the older leaves which then wilt and are shed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-646X,1469-8137,,,,MAR,1992,120,3,,,,,323,334,,10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb01072.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb01072.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992HL23800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

GBS expression studies allowed the identification and characterization of virulence factors and a better understanding of the host-pathogen-environment interactions. The measurement of transcript levels by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a widely used technique in GBS; however, a systematic evaluation and validation of reference gene stability for normalization purposes in GBS expression studies is currently lacking. Therefore, we analyzed the stability of 10 candidate reference genes (16SrRNA, gIcK, glnA, groEL, gyrA, recA, rpoB, rpsL, sdhA and tkt) in three GBS prototype strains (O90R, NEM316 and 2603V/R) grown at different temperature conditions (37 degrees C and 40 degrees C). Our approach was based on the calibration of transcript levels from each gene against the number of bacteria from the same sample (ratio messenger RNA/genomic DNA). As a complementary analysis, reference gene stability was also investigated through the bioinformatic applications, geNorm and NormFinder. Considering the whole GBS development cycle, only a minority of genes were stable under both growth conditions, but this number increased when restricting the analysis to the logarithmic time-points. The range of stable genes was higher at 37 degrees C, where recA and sdhA were stable simultaneously for the three strains, and six out of 10 genes were stable for at least two strains. At 40 degrees C, recA showed up again as one of the best options, suggesting its potential use as reference gene in future qRT-PCR studies. The results generated with geNorm and NormFinder were consistent with those obtained experimentally and evidenced minor variations either among strains or temperature conditions. In conclusion, the fluctuation of expression of reference genes observed among different GBS strains and growth conditions highlights the importance of carefully validating, for each experimental scenario, the use of reference, genes for qRT-PCR normalization purposes. Nevertheless, recA seems to be a good candidate for such optimizations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

All these parameters exert linear or non linear influences that fluctuate in threshold and intensity between sites. Because of the lack of field experiments and to the high variability in time (diurnal and seasonal cycle) and space (regions, soil and vegetation type) of the environmental parameters influencing NO emissions, estimates of NO emissions worldwide still remain highly uncertain. In this study we developed nonlinear regressions to describe NO flux emission from soil in dependency with relevant environmental parameters for a forest site in a temperate region (Hoglwald, South Germany, 1994-1997) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The resulting algorithm links NO fluxes with air, surface and depth temperatures, surface WFPS (Water Field Pore Space) and humus pH. All these parameters were evaluated and selected as relevant and non redundant. Network performances are evaluated for different numbers of hidden neurons. Resulting equations linking NO fluxes from soils and variables are obtained, and show to perform well with measurements (R-2 = 0.81). Average NO fluxes values of 14.6 gN ha(-1) d(-1) are obtained for calculated and measured fluxes. In a second part, 2002-2003 NO soil fluxes are estimated from the ANN equation obtained from 1994 1997 flux measurements performed at the same site. Overall, simulated results give a good estimation of NO fluxes, with a mean value of 15.3 gN ha d(-1) close to the 21.7 gN ha d(-1) measured mean for the 2002-2003 period.

At the same time, the dissolution of CO2 into seawater is increasing surface ocean acidity, a process known as ocean acidification. Effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers have been documented to be stimulative, inhibitive, or neutral. Elevated CO2 and reduced pH levels can interact with solar radiation, which fluctuates over different time scales from limiting to saturating or even stressful levels, to bring about synergistic, antagonistic, or balanced effects on marine primary producers at different depths or under changing weather conditions. However, shoaling of the upper mixed layer (enhanced stratification) due to ocean warming and freshening (rain, ice melting) can lead to additional photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet (UV) exposure, which can have both benefits and costs to photosynthetic organisms. Elevated CO2 concentrations under low or moderate levels of PAR have been shown to enhance photosynthesis or growth of both phytoplankton and macroalgae; excessive levels of PAR, however, can lead to additional inhibition of photosynthesis or growth under elevated CO2, and addition of UV radiation (280 to 400 nm) can increase or down-regulate such inhibition, since solar UV-B (280 to 315 nm) radiation often harms algal cells, while UV-A (315 to 400 nm) at moderate levels stimulates photosynthetic carbon fixation in both phytoplankton and macroalgae. In view of warming effects, increased temperatures have been shown to enhance photorepair of UV-damaged molecules, though it simultaneously enhances respiratory carbon loss. The net effects of ocean acidification on marine primary producers are therefore largely dependent on the photobiological conditions (light limitation, light or UV stress), as well as interactions with rising temperature and other variables such as altered nutrient availability. Hence, feedbacks between changing carbonate chemistry and solar radiation across the entire spectrum present complications to interpret and understand ocean acidification effects based on single-factor experiments.",,,,,"gao, kunshan/G-3374-2010; Hutchins, David A/D-3301-2013","Hutchins, David A/0000-0002-6637-756X; Helbling, E.

Experiments were conducted at various temperatures of 408, 428, and 438 K and times of 15 and 60 min. The in-filled steam to the autoclave was supplied by the incineration plant with a gauge pressure of 7 kg/cm(2) and a temperature of 443 K or above. The results obtained from the experiments show that the less energy- and time-consuming autoclaving conditions (408 K and 15 min, denoted as Case A408-15) are effective. Comparisons of the properties and characteristics of autoclaved FW (FWA) of Case A408-15 with those of FW are made. The wet bulk volume and wet bulk density of FW (A) are dramatically reduced to 15.64% and increased to 313.37% relative to those of FW, respectively. This makes the subsequent processing and reuse for FWA more convenient than FW. The autoclaving results in an increase of carbon content and a decrease of nitrogen content, and thus an increase of the C/N ratio of FWA. The contents of sulfur, hemi-cellulose, and cellulose of FWA are also reduced. All these fluctuations are beneficial for making compost or other usages from FWA than FW. The autoclaved liquid product (LA) separated from FWA and liquid condensate (LC) from the released gas possess high COD and TOC. These two liquids can be mixed for use as liquid fertilizers with proper conditioning. Alternatively, further anaerobic digestion of the mixture of FWA, LA, and LC can offer enhanced biogas production for power generation.

Efficacy of this method is based on the assumption that chemical properties of extracted solutions remain stable from the moment of collection until analysis. Extracted substrate solution can be analyzed directly in the greenhouse or sent to laboratories for complete nutritional analysis; thus, proper sample preservation methods (e.g., filtration and low temperatures) are critical for reducing sample contamination or degradation during storage. However, evidence of how these preservation methods affect chemical characteristics of PT samples is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of storage time, storage temperature, and filtration of PT samples on pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and nutrient concentrations from pine bark- and peat-based substrates. PT extracts were obtained from liquid-fertilized fallow pots of either 100% milled pine bark (Expt. 1) or a 4 sphagnum peat: 1 perlite (by volume) substrate (Expt. 2). Aliquots of PT extract were either filtered or nonfiltered and then stored in plastic bottles at 22, 4, or 20 degrees C. EC, pH, and nutrient concentrations were analyzed at 0, 1, 7, and 30 days after PT sample collection. EC and pH in PT extracts of peat and pine bark, respectively, changed 1 day after collection. Storage time had the greatest effect on nutrient concentrations of samples stored at 20 degrees C. However, at day 30, nutrient concentrations had also changed in samples stored at 4 and -22 degrees C. Analytes that fluctuated most in both experiments and across all preservation treatments were dissolved organic carbon, total dissolved nitrogen, NO3- -N, and PO43- - P, whereas Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42- -S were more stable in PT samples. This research suggests EC and pH should be analyzed immediately, whereas samples requiring nutrient analysis should be filtered immediately after collection, stored at 4 or - 22 degrees C (preferably -22 degrees C), and analyzed within 7 days of collection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-5345,2327-9834,,,,OCT,2020,55,10,,,,,1597,1604,,10.21273/HORTSCI15232-20,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI15232-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000577188700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

To reveal the effects of different modes of regulation on the energy budget of soil in a region with seasonally frozen soil, four treatments, including the regulation of bare land (BL), biochar (CS), and straw (JS), and the combined regulation of biochar and straw (CJS), were used in field experiments. The variations in the soil temperature, liquid water content, and total water content were analyzed, the energy budget of the soil was calculated, the response functions of the soil energy were determined, and the mechanism of soil energy transfer was elucidated. The results showed that, during the freezing period, the JS treatment reduced the amplitudes of the variations in the soil temperature and liquid water content and increased the water content at the soil surface. During the thawing period, the CJS treatment effectively improved the soil hydrothermal conditions. During the freezing period, the heat absorbed by the CS and JS treatments reduced the fluctuation of the soil energy budget. At a soil depth of 10 cm, the spectral entropy of a time series of the soil net energy was 0.837 under BL treatment, and the CS, JS, and CJS treatments decreased by 0.015, 0.059, and 0.045, respectively, compared to the BL treatment. During the thawing period, the CS treatment promoted energy exchange between the soil and the external environment, and the spectral entropy of a time series of the soil net energy was increased; the JS treatment had the opposite effect. The CJS treatment weakened the impact of environmental factors on the soil energy budget during the freezing period, while it enhanced the energy exchange between the soil and the environment during the thawing period. This study can provide important theoretical and technical support for the efficient utilization of soil hydrothermal resources on farmland in cold regions.",,,,,,"Li, Tianxiao/0000-0002-1066-9563",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2071-1050,,,,MAR 1,2020,12,5,,,,,,,1782,10.3390/su12051782,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12051782,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000522470900083,View Full Record in Web of Science

This review assembles the large amount of information on the reproduction and early life history of C. typicus that has emerged since the 1970s and has made this species one of the best-studied copepods, similar in that regard to species of Acartia and Calamus. Observations on mating behavior and the female gametogenic and oogenic cycles are presented, together with information on seasonal cycles of egg production rates in Mediterranean and Atlantic populations from various regions. These studies indicate a strong latitudinal gradient, with continuous reproduction and the main spawning season Occurring earlier (late winter/spring) in warmer waters such as the Mediterranean Sea, compared to northern areas Such as the North Sea and in the Kattegat, where C. typicus actively reproduces mainly in late summer and fall with reproduction ceasing altogether in winter in the German Bight. These observations strongly suggest that temperature is the controlling factor for reproductive activity in this species. Egg development times are also temperature dependent but do not vary with latitude, and there is as yet no conclusive evidence that diapause egg production occurs in C. typicus. Laboratory experiments have shown that food quantity and quality both affect fecundity and offspring fitness, but most of these studies have focused on diatom and dinoflagellate diets and non-algal prey have been strongly underrepresented, despite their importance for this omnivorous copepod. Large fluctuations in hatching success and naupliar survival have been reported in field surveys and have subsequently been related to maternal feeding history and food quality or toxicity in laboratory experiments. We identify future lines of research that will help to explain the interannual variability in breeding intensity and recruitment of C. typicus in the field based on better understanding of the species' reproductive biology.

In particular, low absolute humidity (AH) has been shown to increase influenza virus transmissibility and has been identified to explain the onset of epidemics in temperate regions. Here, we aim to study the potential climatic drivers of influenza-like illness (ILI) epidemiology in Vietnam, a tropical country characterized by a high diversity of climates. We specifically focus on quantifying and explaining the seasonality of ILI. Methods: We used 18 years (1993-2010) of monthly ILI notifications aggregated by province (52) and monthly climatic variables (minimum, mean, maximum temperatures, absolute and relative humidities, rainfall and hours of sunshine) from 67 weather stations across Vietnam. Seasonalities were quantified from global wavelet spectra, using the value of the power at the period of 1 year as a measure of the intensity of seasonality. The 7 climatic time series were characterized by 534 summary statistics which were entered into a regression tree to identify factors associated with the seasonality of AH. Results were extrapolated to the global scale using simulated climatic times series from the NCEP/NCAR project. Results: The intensity of ILI seasonality in Vietnam is best explained by the intensity of AH seasonality. We find that ILI seasonality is weak in provinces experiencing weak seasonal fluctuations in AH (annual power <17.6), whereas ILI seasonality is strongest in provinces with pronounced AH seasonality (power >17.6). In Vietnam, AH and ILI are positively correlated. Conclusions: Our results identify a role for AH in driving the epidemiology of ILI in a tropical setting. However, in contrast to temperate regions, high rather than low AH is associated with increased ILI activity. Fluctuation in AH may be the climate factor that underlies and unifies the seasonality of ILI in both temperate and tropical regions. Alternatively, the mechanism of action of AH on disease transmission may be different in cold-dry versus hot-humid settings. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Palmer in September and October 2007 in the Bellingshausen Sea in an area recently experiencing considerable changes in both climate and sea ice cover. Snow and ice properties were observed at 3 short-term stations and a 27-day drift station (Ice Station Belgica, ISB) during the winter-spring transition. Repeat measurements were performed on sea ice and snow cover at 5 ISB sites, each having different physical characteristics, with mean ice (snow) thicknesses varying from 0.6 m (0.1 m) to 2.3 m (0.7 m). Ice cores retrieved every five days from 2 sites and measured for physical, biological, and chemical properties. Three ice mass-balance buoys (IMBs) provided continuous records of snow and ice thickness and temperature. Meteorological conditions changed from warm fronts with high winds and precipitation followed by cold and calm periods through four cycles during ISB. The snow cover regulated temperature flux and controlled the physical regime in which sea ice morphology changed. Level thin ice areas had little snow accumulation and experienced greater thermal fluctuations resulting in brine salinity and volume changes, and winter maximum thermodynamic growth of similar to 0.6 m in this region. Flooding and snow-ice formation occurred during cold spells in ice and snow of intermediate thickness. In contrast, little snow-ice formed in flooded areas with thicker ice and snow cover, instead nearly isothermal, highly permeable ice persisted. In spring, short-lived cold air episodes did not effectively penetrate the sea ice nor overcome the effect of ocean heat flux, thus favoring net ice thinning from bottom melt over ice thickening from snow-ice growth, in all cases. These warm ice conditions were consistent with regional remote sensing observations of earlier ice breakup and a shorter sea ice season, more recently observed in the Bellingshausen Sea.

The experiment was established in fields, which had for many years been under a double-cropping forage system with maize from May to September and a winter crop (mixture of cereals and Italian ryegrass) during the rest of the year. In addition to N fertilizers, dairy-cattle slurry was applied regularly at the sowing of each crop. On this intensive forage system, quantification of N released from slurry, crop residues and soil organic matter becomes important when better N use efficiency and reduced environmental impact from agricultural practices are required. Net N mineralization rates of the 0-10 cm soil layer fluctuated considerably between consecutive incubation periods and ranged from - 0.88 to 1.87 mg N kg(-1) day(-1) with annual average rates of between 0.41 and 0.65 mg N kg(-1) day(-1). The total N mineralized in the 10 cm depth soil layer reached values between 122 and 224 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), showing that mineralization was a very important N source for the crops. The amounts of N released during the cold season (November-February) were equivalent to 27-48% of the yearly total. Regression analysis indicated that seasonal variation in N mineralization was only poorly explained by soil moisture and temperature. The changing balance during the year between soil moisture and temperature will contribute to the relatively constant N mineralization rates. Soil mineral N contents during the maize crop were high and exceeded the nutrient requirements for the optimum yield of this crop. Under the climatic conditions of the region and due to the poor development of the winter crop plants at the time, the mineral N left in the soil after the maize crop and released by mineralization during the cold season is particularly vulnerable to nitrate leaching losses.

To understand the impact of recurrent freezing and thawing on soil microorganisms and their environment, three soils from diverse land-use types (grassland, cut grassland and cropland) in the semi-arid area of the Loess Plateau were subjected to two different freeze thaw cycles (FTC) for 48 days (either 4 days each at -2 degrees C and + 3 degrees C for 6 FTC or 8 days each at -2 degrees C and + 3 degrees C for 3 FTC). Nutrient content and mobilization in the soil, and microbial biomass and functional diversity were examined. When subjected to these freeze thaw cycles, soil respiration was low during the -2 degrees C phase and high during the +3 degrees C phase, decreasing in successive cycles, which indicates the rapid response of microbial activity even after long exposure to fluctuating temperatures. Soil respiration stabilized after 32 days in the three soils in the treatment with 3 FTC but continued to decrease in the treatment with 6 FTC. With each successive freeze thaw cycle, microbial biomass C and N decreased gradually in all the tested soils. M the end of the experiment, the 6 FTC treatment had more microbial biomass C and N than the 3 FTC treatment in each soil type, indicating that microbial activity (respiration) was controlled mainly by the rapid freeze thaw cycles rather than microbial biomass. Soil inorganic N concentration declined in all soils subjected to 6 FTC but increased when subjected to only 3 FTC, suggesting that the surviving microorganisms in the treatment with 6 FTC had more potential for using soil N to adapt to the freeze thaw stress.

Rapid environmental fluctuations and phenotypic plasticity through optimization of fitness-related traits in organisms play important roles in shaping intraspecific divergence. The coastal systems experience strong variations in multiple abiotic environmental factors, especially the temperature. We used a typical intertidal species, Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), to investigate the interaction between plasticity and adaptive evolution. We collected intertidal and subtidal oysters from two ecological niches and carried out common garden experiments for one generation. We identified fine-scale vertical adaptive divergence between intertidal and subtidal F-1 progeny at both sites, based on different hierarchical phenotypes, including morphological, physiological, and molecular traits. We further quantified the global plasticity to thermal stress through transcriptomic analysis. The intertidal oysters exhibited slow growth rate. However, they showed high survival and metabolic rates under heat stress, indicating vertically fine-scale phenotypic adaptive mechanisms and evolutionary trade-offs between growth and thermal tolerance. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the intertidal oysters have evolved high plasticity. The genes were classified into three types: evolutionarily divergent, concordantly plastic, and adaptive plastic genes. The evolved divergence between intertidal and subtidal oysters for these gene sets showed a significant positive correlation with plastic changes of subtidal populations in response to high temperature. Furthermore, the intertidal oysters exhibited delayed large-scale increase in expressional plasticity than that in subtidal counterparts. The same direction between plasticity and selection suggests that the oysters have evolved adaptive plasticity. This implies that adaptive plasticity facilitates the oyster to adapt to severe intertidal zones. The oysters exposed to strong environmental variability are thermal tolerant and have high adaptive potential to face the current global warming. Our findings will not only provide new insights into the significant role of plasticity in adaptive evolution that can be extended to other marine invertebrates, but also provide basic information for oyster resources conservation and reef reestablishment.",,,,,"li, li/GPX-3938-2022; Li, Li/AEM-3636-2022; LI, LI/GVS-5344-2022","Li, Ao/0000-0002-7130-2386",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-042X,,,,,AUG 20,2018,9,,,,,,,,825,10.3389/fphys.2018.00825,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2018.00825,,,,,,,,30210351,,,,,WOS:000442148600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One usually estimates ICUE based on the net photosynthetic rate or the assumed proportional relationship between growth efficiency and ICUE. However, thus far, protocols for easily estimating annual TCUE remain problematic. Here, we present a theoretical framework (based on the metabolic scaling theory) to predict whole-plant annual TCUE by directly measuring instantaneous net photosynthetic and respiratory rates. This framework makes four predictions, which were evaluated empirically using seedlings of nine Picea taxa: (i) the flux rates of CO2 and energy will scale isometrically as a function of plant size, (ii) whole-plant net and gross photosynthetic rates and the net primary productivity will scale isometrically with respect to total leaf mass, (iii) these scaling relationships will be independent of ambient temperature and humidity fluctuations (as measured within an experimental chamber) regardless of the instantaneous net photosynthetic rate or dark respiratory rate, or overall growth rate and (iv) TCUE will scale isometrically with respect to instantaneous efficiency of carbon use (i.e., the latter can be used to predict the former) across diverse species. These predictions were experimentally verified. We also found that the ranking of the nine taxa based on net photosynthetic rates differed from ranking based on either ICUE or TCUE. In addition, the absolute values of ICUE and TCUE significantly differed among the nine taxa, with both ICUE and temperature-corrected ICUE being highest for Picea abies and lowest for Picea schrenkiana. Nevertheless, the data are consistent with the predictions of our general theoretical framework, which can be used to access annual carbon-use efficiency of different species at the level of an individual plant based on simple, direct measurements. Moreover, we believe that our approach provides a way to cope with the complexities of different ecosystems, provided that sufficient measurements are taken to calibrate our approach to that of the system being studied.",,,,,"Niklas, Karl/AAV-4760-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,JUN,2015,35,6,,,,,599,607,,10.1093/treephys/tpv030,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpv030,,,,,,,,25939866,,,,,WOS:000357893400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Laboratory experiments investigating cover crop effects N2O emissions were performed in a controlled environment chamber programmed fora 14 h light period, 18 degrees C day temperature, and 15 degrees C night temperature. Treatments with or without a living rye cover crop were treated with either: (i) no manure: (ii) a phosphorus-based manure application rate (low manure): or (iii) a nitrogen-based manure application rate (high manure). We observed a significant reduction in N2O emissions in the presence of the rye cover crop. Field experiments were performed on a fine-loamy soil in Central Iowa from October 12, 2005 to October 2, 2006. We observed no significant effect of the cover crop on cumulative N2O emissions in the field. The primary factor influencing N2O emission was N application rate, regardless of form or timing. The response of N2O emission to N additions was non-linear, with progressively more N2O emitted with increasing N application. These results indicate that while cover crops have the potential to reduce N2O emissions, N application rate may be the overriding factor.

Specimens of Pocillopora capitata Verrill 1864 were exposed to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) for 32h under laboratory conditions. We examined lipid peroxidation (MDA), antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT, GPx and GST), chlorophyll a (Chl a), carotenoid pigments (CPs), mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), and expulsion of zooxanthellae. Our results revealed that corals exposed to UVR had relatively low levels of carotenoids and antioxidant enzyme activities compared to those exposed to PAR, as well as lower CPs/Chl a ratios. Although MAAs and CPs are rapidly produced as non-enzymatic antioxidants in response to UVR in corals, these were not sufficient, even in the dark phase of the experiment, to mitigate the damage caused by formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which caused breakdown of the symbiotic relationship between the zooxanthellae and the host animal to an extent 33 times greater than in the PAR treatment. In this study, it could be possible to distinguish that, parallel to the short-term adjustments, such as the amount of pigment in the algae or the sensitivity of the photosynthetic response reported in other species of coral, P. capitata exhibits at the enzymatic level a series of responses oriented to resist the effects derived from the propagation of ROS and, thus, to adapt to and maintain its reproductive capacity in shallow oceanic environments that commonly exhibit high UVR levels. Nevertheless, as a result of the inappropriate location of the artificial intercommunication structure of the Juluapan Lagoon with respect to the arrecifal area of study and therefore of the tides influence, other variables, such as the changes in short-term in turbidity, sediment inputs, nutrients, temperature and osmolarity, can act in combination and cause irreversible damage.

Yields produced since then have fluctuated widely depending on the climatic conditions in the winter and occurrence of the disorders affecting the floral bud. The affected bud produces reduced flower numbers in the clusters. Occurrence of disorder varies greatly between cultivars, seasons and locations, the cvs. Nijisseiki and Housui are the ones that have been presenting the highest occurrence, mainly in the areas with smaller intensity of cold in the winter. There are reports of a similar disorder affecting Nashi production in New Zealand, where it is known as budjump. In Brazil the problem is known as bud abortion but there has been no information of the causes nor the control methods. The experiments were conducted for three years to study the incidence and possible causes of the disorder. The studies are addressed for the occurrence time, formation of the floral primordia, concentration of water in the branches, variation of the amount of chilling hours, fluctuation of temperatures and effect of cultural practices. The results showed that the bud abortion intensified just before flowering, presenting normal floral primordia at the beginning of autumn. The number of flowers per cluster increased with the increase of the chilling hours which also reduced the percentage of bud abortion. Trees that received 1,440 chilling hours did not present the disorder and they had more flowers per cluster. Temperatures of 24degreesC at intervals of 15 days did not increase the bud abortion, when the tree received 1,440 chilling hours. The concentration of the water in the branches and the covering of the tree with cloth did not influence the incidence of bud abortion. The practice of girdling showed a tendency to reduce the problem in two or more years.

The stations were installed on the valley floor within a 1.5 km x 0.8 km area and collected 1-Hz wind and pressure data and 0.2-Hz temperature and humidity data. We describe the weather stations and analyze the spatiotemporal variability of the measured variables during three nights with radiative cooling. Two nights were characterized by the presence of dense ice fog, one night with a persistent ('heavy') fog, and one with a short-lived ('moderate') fog, while the third night had no fog. Frost-point depressions were larger preceding the night without fog and showed a continued decrease during the no-fog night. On both fog nights, the frost-point depression reached values close to zero early in the night, but similar to 5 h earlier on the heavy-fog night than on the moderate-fog night. Spatial variability of temperature and humidity was smallest during the heavy-fog night and increased temporarily during short periods when wind speeds increased and the fog lifted. During all three nights, wind speeds did not exceed 2 m/s. The temporal variability of the wind speed and direction was larger during the fog nights than during the no-fog nights, but was particularly large during the heavy-fog night. The large variability corresponded with short-lived (5-10 min) pressure variations with amplitudes on the order of 0.5 hPa, indicating gravity wave activity. These pressure fluctuations occurred at all stations and were correlated in particular with variability in wind direction. Although not able to provide a complete picture of the nocturnal boundary layer, our low-cost weather stations were able to continuously collect data that were comparable to those of nearby research-grade instruments. From these data, we distinguished between fog and no-fog events, successfully quantified spatiotemporal variations in surface properties during these events, and detected gravity waves.",,,,,"van den Bossche, Michael/J-6475-2012","van den Bossche, Michael/0000-0002-8428-8413",,,,,,,,,,,,,0033-4553,1420-9136,,,,SEP,2016,173,9,,,,,3031,3048,,10.1007/s00024-016-1352-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-016-1352-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000382941400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

For better and clear arrangement, interpretation and practical illustration, the results are presented in the form of diagrams for particular experimental period, i.e. for several-year persisting closed cycles: years 1975 - 1979 (Fig. 1), 1980 -- 1982 (Fig. 2), 1983 - 1985 (Fig. 3), 1986 - 1988 (Fig. 4), 1989 - 1990 (Fig. 5). As documented by Fig. 6, years with warmer and more arid growing season prevailed, thus enhancing the formation of more baking than milling component of the technological quality. Longer action of high air temperature (above 25-degrees-C) at the end of the growing season is very often a main reason for grain yield decline and worser quality of gluten, pointing up the negative relation between its amount and quality in these years (Fig. 3 - 1983, Fig, 4 - 1986). In the years 1979 - 1980 (Fig. 2) and 1984 -1985 (Fig. 3) with more moisture and colder growing season, an intensive growth and better grain development was displayed favourable (at higher temperatures at the end of the growing season) in yields and milling quality (CVM), though the protein content was very low (below 10 %). Ample precipitation to the onset of anthesis and subsequent higher (but not extreme) air temperature without marked fluctuations with low precipitation would be ideal for obtaining high and quality wheat yield. Sufficient amount of precipitation is required in autumn in association with formation of favourable moisture conditions in the soil during stand establishment, facilitating the determination of optimum sowing date and rate. In our conditions of studies of sowing dates - September (third decade) and October (first to second decade), and October date should suit more, probably this is associated with more favourable moisture conditions and with longer time for pre-sowing soil preparation (Fig. 7). Sowing rates tested by us were at the beginning of experiments very high 7, 6, later 5 and 3.5 million germinating seeds per hectare. Technological quality of wheat (without respect to cultivar and site) was better for lower sowing rates. It seems, as referred by K a b r t (1983) that the quality is formed according to the number for spikes and grains to which the taken nutrients are to be splitted. In over-thickened stand the quality is falling, though the sowing rate is increasing for obtaining the high yield. However, the amount of yield only cannot be assessed in efficient use of winter wheat, as in view of the quality of a product, less means often more. Quality wheat provides more valuable materials for processing, whereas this improves the benefit not only for a processor but also for grower due to lower costs for its obtaining.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0370-663X,,,,,,1992,38,9-10,,,,,727,732,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JY82900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ephemeral wetlands have important ecological functions but information about their water quality over its flooding periods is relatively limited. In this study, the water chemistry and physical parameters of three ephemeral wetlands and their nearby water bodies, including first order and second order streams and groundwater in the Piedmont ecoregion of South Carolina, were closely monitored during their flooding periods from January to June 2012. Nutrient and water quality analyses demonstrated the chemistries of wetlands, stream, and groundwater were different from each other in spite of their proximity. Greater concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen with a major portion in humic-acid-like and fulvic-acid-like fractions were generally found in wetland waters. In contrast, significantly lower DOC concentrations with a greater portion of inorganic nitrogen were observed in stream and groundwater. Electrical conductivity at 25 degrees C (EC25) and temperature measurements showed a greater fluctuation in wetlands, indicating their poor buffering capacity against environmental changes. Results of this field study suggested that these small ephemeral wetlands in the Piedmont Ecoregion have relatively unique biogeochemistry in comparing their adjacent water bodies.

Individual rotation pauses of F-1 between rotary steps correspond to the waiting state of a certain elementary reaction step of ATP hydrolysis. This allows us to investigate the impact of the frequency modulation of the rotary fluctuation on the rate of the individual reaction steps by measuring the duration of rotation pauses.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of different fluctuating light regimes (from 24 to 100% transmissivity) on leaf physiology, morphology, anatomy, and structure of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) in a silvopastoral experiment (New Zealand). Slatted shade structures created a bimodal light regime that represented an existing silvopastoral system. Morphologically, as transmissivity decreased the length of the youngest fully expanded leaf and pseudo-stem height increased by up to 33% and the leaf width declined up to 22%. Physiologically, leaf adaptation to different light regimes was characterized by: (i) the light-saturated rate of net photosynthesis (Pmax) and to less extent the photosynthetic efficiency (alpha) in sun conditions was double; (ii) in sunny conditions plants grown under shade were photosynthetically less efficient than plants grown in full sunlight with lower Pmax and alpha values; (iii) when plants were exposed to severe shade, leaves adapted to severe shade condition had the highest Pmax, alpha, and theta, and saturated at the minimum photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) value. These changes in leaf photosynthesis characteristics under different light regimes were attributed to anatomical changes that caused reductions in stomatal conductance (gs), the mesophyll surface area/leaf surface area ratio (A(mes)/A) and maintenance respiration for shade adapted plants. These photosynthetic responses and leaf adaptations to fluctuating light regimes can be included into a canopy photosynthesis model to improve the accuracy of DM predictions in silvopastoral systems.",,,,,"McNeil, David/C-2426-2014; Peri, Pablo Luis/ACF-3770-2022","McNeil, David/0000-0002-1831-7335; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-1962,,,,,NOV-DEC,2007,99,6,,,,,1502,1513,,10.2134/agronj2006.0347,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2006.0347,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000251104400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The complex interactions among these factors highlight the need for physiology-based models which describe seedling and sapling performance under current and changing climatic conditions. These models should be flexible enough to take into account the effect of growth light environment changes on physiological processes and, therefore, to assist in the decision-making process on different silvicultural management alternatives under climatic uncertainty. In the present work the net photosynthesic rate of Pinus pinea L. natural regeneration is modeled as a function of light irradiance using the non-rectangular hyperbola function. The model fit was carried out following a two-step procedure, where the parameters of the original function were expanded over the most influential factors: leaf temperature, soil moisture, global site factor and needle type. The developed model allows defining the optimal niche conditions for the natural regeneration of the species and permits identifying the most limiting conditions which prevent natural regeneration. Regeneration niche was assessed by using the model to simulate net CO2 assimilation of a seedling over twelve contrasting light environments during both a normal and an extremely dry vegetative period. The model predicts that the most favorable carbon balance would be found in mid-shaded expositions, while fully exposed plants at midday during summer would exhibit longer periods of negative assimilation rates, especially on severe dry years.

In the H64L mutant, we have observed a largely reduced width of the absorption spectrum and only a slight temporal shift of the hole-burning spectrum. These observations both reflect the suppressed conformational fluctuation in the mutant. On the other hand, the pH-dependent change in the absorption spectrum could not be solely explained by the change in the protonation state of His64 induced by the pH change. These results suggest that although the fluctuation dynamics observed by the TRTHB experiment of the native sample mainly reflects the conformational motion around His64, the interconversion process of His64 between its protonated and unprotonated states has a minor contribution. Instead, we have proposed a tentative interpretation that the motion of the water molecule around His64 is the main source of the observed dynamics in the TRTHB technique.",,,,,"Ishikawa, Haruto/B-1562-2012; Shibata, Yutaka/Q-2517-2017","Ishikawa, Haruto/0000-0001-6362-5719; Shibata, Yutaka/0000-0002-7510-503X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3495,,,,,FEB,2001,80,2,,,,,1013,1023,,10.1016/S0006-3495(01)76080-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(01)76080-8,,,,,,,,11159468,,,,,WOS:000166765100043,View Full Record in Web of Science

Following egg hatch, emergent larvae must locate host plant roots to avoid starvation and this represents the most vulnerable part of the life cycle. We present a model for this aspect of the life cycle, specifically modelling the egg development rate and survival time of the clover root weevil, Sitona lepidus. The model is based on a partial differential equation, developed from age-structure models that are widely used in ecology. The model incorporates stochastic random variation caused by environmental fluctuation and genetic variation in a population, and treats chronological time and biological age as two independent variables. The average developmental rate and the impact of randomness are described by a first-order and a second-order derivative term, respectively. The significance of this model is that it can combine two biological events (egg development and larval survival time) into a single functional event, a potentially important feature for soil-dwelling insects because their concealed habitat does not permit all biological events to be observed. The model was tested against experimental observations of egg development and larval survival time under different soil conditions, firstly by considering egg development and larval survival time as independent biological events and secondly by combining both into a single functional event. Model simulations and experimental observations were in close agreement in all cases. To further test whether the model could be applied to other insect taxa and incorporate more than two biological events, we compared model simulations with published experimental results for the cereal leaf beetle (Oulema duftschmidi). Simulations of egg hatching and the larval development through several instars compared favourably with all experimental observations, demonstrating that the model has multiple applications.

When cold, fresh waters (Arctic origin) occupy the surface mixed layer, convective overturning of the water column occurs abruptly. Thermobaric convective plumes branch into small-scale (similar to O(10 similar to 100 m)) eddies and engulf ambient deep water on the way down. They induce significant fluctuations in profiles of water properties but do not homogenize the overturned layer completely. As a result, stable stratification remains at depths where temperature, salinity, and potential density decrease. When warm, saline waters (Atlantic origin) exist in the surface mixed layer, it deepens by surface cooling, entraining the underlying water vigorously. Water properties are nearly homogenized in the deepening mixed layer and have opposite features to the first case. These results support a deduction that two different profiles of water properties observed in the Greenland Sea are signatures of two types of deep convection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,AUG 11,2011,116,,,,,,,,C08012,10.1029/2010JC006635,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JC006635,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000293922700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We use data collected on January 9, 2015 to gain insight into relationships between typical shallow radiation fog, turbulence, and gravity waves associated with the surrounding topography. A ae 10-30 m fog layer formed by radiative cooling was observed from 0720 to 0900 MST under cold air temperatures (aea'9 A degrees C), near-saturated (relative humidity with respect to water ae95 %), and calm wind (mostly < 0.5 m s(-1)) conditions. Drainage flows were observed occasionally prior to fog formation, which modulated heat exchanges between air masses through the action of internal gravity waves and cold-air pool sloshing. The fog appeared to be triggered by cold-air advection from the south (ae200A degrees) at 0700 MST. Quasi-periodic oscillations were observed before and during the fog event with a time period of about 15 min. These oscillations were detected in surface pressure, temperature, sensible heat flux, incoming longwave radiation, and turbulent kinetic energy measurements. We hypothesize that the quasi-periodic oscillations were caused by atmospheric gravity waves with a time period of about 10-20 min based on wavelet analysis. During the fog event, internal gravity waves led to about 1 A degrees C fluctuations in air temperatures. After 0835 MST when net radiation became positive, fog started to dissipate due to the surface heating and heat absorption by the fog particles. Overall, this case study provides a concrete example of how fog evolution is modulated by very weak thermal circulations in mountainous terrain and illustrates the need for high density vertical and horizontal measurements to ensure that the highly spatially varying physics in complex terrain are sufficient for hypothesis testing.",,,,,"Roman-Cascon, Carlos/AAA-2971-2019; Leo, Laura Sandra/J-9529-2013; Pryor, Ken/F-5620-2010","Roman-Cascon, Carlos/0000-0003-4724-8102; Leo, Laura Sandra/0000-0003-4103-6862; Pryor, Ken/0000-0002-9766-2080; Pardyjak, Eric/0000-0002-0180-0857; gultepe, ismail/0000-0002-8433-5953",,,,,,,,,,,,,0033-4553,1420-9136,,,,SEP,2016,173,9,,,,,3011,3030,,10.1007/s00024-016-1370-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-016-1370-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000382941400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Successfully realized the concentration measurement of NO2 gas by using the instrument system. This system is mainly composed of two parts: a light source emitting system and a telescope receiving system. The LED with the dominant wavelength of 450 nm is used as a light source to collect the scattered light of the light beam through the telescope. The scattered light received by the telescope is imported into the spectrometer through fiber coupling, DOAS principle using a computer for processing. The theoretical basis for DOAS is Lambert-Beer's law, which describes the attenuation of the electromagnetic radiation energy as it penetrates the material. Based on this principle, the data processing can be summarized as follows : Firstly, a relatively clean spectrum is taken as the background reference spectrum, and the actual measured atmospheric spectrum is divided by the reference spectrum, and the digital high-pass filtering is used to remove the slow changes and then take the logarithm to obtain the optical thickness. Secondly, the instrument function is convolved with the high-resolution cross-section of NO2 to get the low-resolution absorption cross-section matched with the instrument used. Finally, the differential absorption cross-section is combined with the processed differential optical thickness, and the least square method is used to fit out the NO2 concentration value with the light path L. At the same time, by adjusting the angle of light emission and the receiving angle of the telescope, the NO2 concentration at different positions can be measured, and then the three-dimensional distribution of NO2 gas concentration can be obtained. Under the condition of the algorithm determined, the quality of the LED light spectrum is particularly important for the reliability of the instrument system. As the temperature and drive current have a greater impact on the LED spectrum, in order to ensure that the LEDs are in the best working condition, carried out the LED spectral temperature and drive current sensitivity experiments. The test results show that to make sure the acquired spectrum is stable and of high quality, the LEDs should operate at a temperature lower than 20 degrees C, and the drive current needs to be controlled within 1. 5A, and both of them should have a small fluctuation range, In the experiments, the LEDs are working with the temperature of 10 similar to 15 degrees C, the driving current of 1. 4 A and the accuracy of driving current of +/- 1 mA, and all the conditions can meet the experimental requirements. In order to improve the LED array density, to get a more focused beam of light, LED base block with a regular hexagonal structure is chose, and all the blocks have 7 LEDs connected in series, and the blocks are connected in parallel. Compared with using rectangular structure, the space utilization increased by 8% with using regular hexagon structure. At the same time, it is easier to expand and more convenient to maintenance with the working drive of 1. 4 A and the maximum voltage of 23. 8 V. In order to verify the feasibility of the program and the reliability of system, laboratory tests and outdoor experiments were conducted. The concentration of the sample gas of NO2 used in the laboratory was 1 642. 86 mg . m(-3) and the uncertainty was 5%. The system measurement was 1 607. 54 mg . m(-3) with an error of 2. 15% from the nominal value, within the uncertainty range of the calibration. The calculated system test line was 0. 014 3 mg . m(-3) (6. 942 ppb) , therefore, the measurement result can be considered as accurate. The results of outdoor experiments were compared with the data of NO2 given by the national control station over the same period. The results showed that the deviations of the results were within 10% in the corresponding time periods. The linearity of the data fit well with the correlation coefficient of 0. 967, indicating that the system NO2 measured results were accurate. The results of this paper show that the DOAS method based on the blue LED with narrowband light source can measure the vertical distribution of NO2 gas at night, while ensuring the stability of LED light source. It provides a new idea for measuring the vertical distribution of trace gases in atmosphere, especially for measuring the distribution of trace gases in nighttime conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-0593,,,,,MAY,2019,39,5,,,,,1398,1405,,10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2019)05-1398-08,http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2019)05-1398-08,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000469899500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ground-based measurements are more direct but are very localized and limited in coverage. Model predictions provide a more regional perspective but rely on many simplifications and approximations and depend on inputs that are difficult to obtain over extensive areas. The only effective way to achieve soil moisture estimates with the accuracy and coverage required for hydrologic and meteorological applications is to merge information from satellites, ground-based stations, and models. In this paper we describe a convenient data merging (or data assimilation) procedure based on an ensemble Kalman filter. This procedure is illustrated with an application to the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) field experiment. It uses land surface and radiative transfer models to derive soil moisture estimates from airborne L band microwave observations and ground-based measurements of micrometeorological variables, soil texture, and vegetation type. The ensemble filter approach is appealing because (1) it can accommodate a wide range of models, (2) it can account for input and measurement uncertainties, (3) it provides information on the accuracy of its estimates, and (4) it is relatively efficient, making large-scale applications feasible. Results from our SGP97 application of the ensemble Kalman filter include large-scale maps (similar to10,000 km(2)) of soil moisture estimates and estimation error standard deviations for the entire month long experiment and comparisons of filter soil moisture and latent heat estimates to ground truth measurements (gravimetric and flux tower observations). The ground truth comparisons show that the filter is able to track soil moisture fluctuations. The filter estimates are significantly better than those from an open loop'' simulation that includes the same ground-based data but does not incorporate radio brightness measurements. Overall, the results from this field test indicate that the ensemble Kalman filter is an accurate, efficient, and flexible data assimilation procedure that is able to extract useful information from remote sensing measurements.",,,,,"Steele-Dunne, Susan/E-2360-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,DEC 19,2002,38,12,,,,,,,1299,10.1029/2001WR001114,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001WR001114,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000181245600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Annual stream-flow was increased 33 cm or 39% the first year and 27 cm or 28% the second year above the values expected if the watershed were not deforested. Large increases in streamwater concentration were observed for all major ions, except NH4+, SO4 = and HCO3-, approximately five months after the deforestation. Nitrate concentrations were 41-fold higher than the undisturbed condition the first year and 56-fold higher the second. The nitrate concentration in stream water has exceeded, almost continuously, the health levels recommended for drinking water. Sulfate was the only major ion in stream water that decreased in concentration after deforestation. An inverse relationship between sulfate and nitrate concentrations in stream water was observed in both undisturbed and deforested situations. Average streamwater concentrations increased by 417% for Ca++, 408% for Mg++, 1558% for K+ and 177% for Na+ during the two years subsequent to deforestation. Budgetary net losses from Watershed 2 in kg/ha-yr were about 142 for Na3-N, 90 for Ca++, 36 for K+, 32 for SiO2-Si, 24 for Al+++, 18 for Mg++, 17 for Na+, 4 for Cl-, and 0 for SO4-S during 1967-68; whereas for an adjacent, undisturbed watershed (W6) net losses were 9.2 for Ca++, 1.6 for K+, 17 for SiO2-Si, 3.1 for A1(+++), 2.6 for Mg++, 7.0 for Na+, 0.1 for C1(-), and 3.3 for SO4-S. Input of nitrate-nitrogen in precipitation normally exceeds the output in drainage water in the undisturbed ecosystems, and ammonium-nitrogen likewise accumulates in both the undisturbed and deforested ecosystems. Total gross export of dissolved solids, exclusive of organic matter, was about 75 metric tons/km(2) in 1966-67, and 97 metric tons/km(2) in 1967-68, or about 6 to 8 times greater than would be expected for an undisturbed watershed. The greatly increased export of dissolved nutrients from the deforested ecosystem was due to an alteration of the nitrogen cycle within the ecosystem. The drainage streams tributary to Hubbard Brook are normally acid, and as a result of deforestation the hydrogen ion content increased by 5-fold (from pH 5.1 to 4.3). Streamwater temperatures after deforestation were higher than the undisturbed condition during both summer and winter. Also in contrast to the relatively constant temperature in the undisturbed streams, streamwater temperature after deforestation fluctuated 3-4 degrees C during the day in summer. Electrical conductivity increased about 6-fold in the stream water after deforestation and was much more variable. Increased streamwater turbidity as a result of the deforestation was negligible, however the particulate matter output was increased about 4-fold. Whereas the particulate matter is normally 50% inorganic materials, after deforestation preliminary estimates indicate that the proportion of inorganic materials increased to 76% of the total particulates. Supersaturation of dissolved oxygen in stream water from the experimental watersheds is common in all seasons except summer when stream discharge is low. The percent saturation is dependent upon flow rate in the streams. Sulfate, hydrogen ion and nitrate are major constituents in the precipitation. It is suggested that the increase in average nitrate concentration in precipitation compared to data from 1955-56,as well as the consistent annual increase observed from 1964 to 1968, may be some measure of a general increase in air pollution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,,,,1970,40,1,,,,,23,+,,10.2307/1942440,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942440,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1970G250600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Effects of sowing matrix, illumination conditions, soil cover, storage temperature and duration on seed germination were also investigated. The berry was 4.99 +/- 0.45 cm in length, 4.71 +/- 0.30 cm in width, 4.42 +/- 1.07cm in thickness, 38.96 +/- 7.35g in weight, and the seeds were usually 2.28 +/- 0.10cm in length, 2.13 +/- 0.13cm in width, 2.24 +/- 0.15cm in thickness, and 6.67 +/- 0.76g in weight. The germination percentage of fresh seeds decreased with delaying of storage time when being preserved at room temperature in sealing condition, and the seeds lost germinability after 6 months, while the seeds could prolong the life of seeds at 3 degrees C and lost germinability after 10 months, so the seeds were likely to be recalcitrant. The seeds could reached higher germination percentage in sand, yellow soil and peat soil, but could not germinate in the nutrient soil used in this experiment. The change of illumination had no significant effect on the seed germination. Soil-buried seeds at a depth of 1 cm had a lower emergence percentage than those with only 2/3 of the volume buried in the soil. Syzygium jambos is an large evergreen tree of Myrtaceae family, typically 6 to 15 meters high, with a tendency to low branching. There are many varieties of it worldwide. In Thailand the commonest cultivated variety bears green berried, but Malaysian variety generally bears red ones. In many regions its fruit is a shade of pale yellow, often with a slight blush([1-3]). There seems to be considerable variation in flavour if such a description has any merit; in South Africa for example, there is no noticeable bitter aftertaste, but the bouquet is decidedly assertive([4-5]). In Southeast Asian countries, its fruit is frequently served with spiced sugar, its wood is dense and accordingly used as a source of charcoal. Because of rich vitamin C, its fruit can be eaten raw or used in various regional recipes. And because of variously rich tannin that are of some antimicrobial interest, it is also used in regional traditional medicine([6-7]). It always grows in all kinds of soil, mostly grow naturally in waterfront and valley wetlands, and can grow well in sand and soil, especially fertile, deep and moist soil. It is native to Southeast Asia and Hainan Province in China, but now widely cultivated in Southern China be cultivated as a windbreak, good fruit and garden greening tree in humid tropics and south subtropics([8-10]). But it has become established and invasive in several regions. Concern has been expressed on the threat to several ecosystems, including those on several Hawaiian islands, Reunion, the Galapagos Islands, parts of Australia and the warmer regions of the Americas. However, in Hawaii, it has been almost wiped out by the introduced rust Puccinia psidii([8-9]). Because this plant have the ornamental and greening value, edible and medicinal value, so it has great research and development potential. Under natural conditions, the plant can be propagated only by seeds. The study on the seed morphology and the germination characteristics of Syzygium jambos under the different environmental conditions will be helpful for the propagation of this tree. An understanding of how different environments affect seed germination will enhance our ability to predict fluctuations in population dynamics in natural habitats. Therefore, we conducted this study to determine the seed germination pattern under different storage conditions, incubation temperatures and light regimes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2475-8833,,978-1-60595-592-6,,,,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000468579900026,View Full Record in Web of Science

The semen quality may be significantly affected by environment, by fluctuations in temperature, humidity and photoperiod. The objective of this study was to evaluate the seasons influence (spring, summer, autumn and winter) on semen characteristics and testosterone levels in Nellore and Simmental bulls raised on field. Materials, Methods & Results: The city of Presidente Prudente-SP-Brazil, where the experiment was realize, presents latitude 21 degrees 29'50 '' S, longitude 49 degrees 14'2 '' W and altitude of 475 meters. In 2008/2009, the climatic factors measured for Spring - SP; Summer - SU; Autumn - A and the Winter - W were: average temperature (SP - 25.9; SU - 26.6; A - 21.9 and W - 21.1 degrees C), stroke (SP - 400.9; SU - 464.0; A - 721.3 and W - 142.6 hours), cumulative rainfall (SP - 291.8; SU - 925,0; A - 273.0; and W - 191.8 mm) and average relative humidity (SP - 65.9; SU - 71.7; A - 70.1 and W - 66.7%). Five Nellore and five Simmental bulls with 48-72 months old, extensively managed were evaluated for sexual soundness using physical and morphological characteristics of semen and testosterone serum levels. Sixteen semen samples by automatic electroejaculation were carried out in each of 10 bulls, totaling 160 samples. The experiment was conducted from September to August and made four harvests in each of the four seasons. The analysis of testosterone concentration (ng/dL) were performed with commercial kits and quantification of the hormone made by radioimmunoassay (RIA) totalizing eight replicates per bull, 2 per season, totalizing 80 samples. Data on characteristics of semen and testosterone evaluation were subjected to analysis of variance, considering the study as a factorial experiment, and the differences between means compared by Tukey test at 5%. There was decreased motility and vigor semen (P < 0.05) during winter in Simmental bulls. There was correlation between serum testosterone (P < 0.01) to motility and vigor in Nellore and Simmental bulls. In relation to sperm morphology, major and total defects were different (P < 0.05) between breeds in the spring, with higher percentages observed in the Simmental breed. In the winter, for minor and total defects, there were differences between breeds (P < 0.05) being major to the Simmental. For the Simmental breed, there was difference (P < 0.05) between summer and winter seasons for the major sperm defects and total quality with better morphology in the summer. The sperm concentration, between breeds, in spring and autumn showed differences (P < 0.05), being higher for the Simmental. There was difference (P < 0.05) between breeds for testosterone, in the summer season. In the Simmental breed there was a significant correlation between testosterone and semen characteristics, being mass movement (0.31), concentration (0.37) and total defects (-0.26). For the major and total defects in the Simmental, average correlations were obtained in relation to testosterone. Discussion: The seasonal variation has been studied with a focus on physical characteristics and sperm morphology in cattle in the tropics, describing the decline in semen quality can occur due to thermal discomfort of the animals. Based on the data it is possible to conclude that the results showed a hormonal and semen characteristics variation throughout the season change the semen quality.

The aim of this research was to estimate in situ abundance and growth of Mytilus galloprovincialis planktonic larvae. Plankton samples were filtered through gauze of 63 mu m mesh and identified, counted and measured using an inverted microscope. Short-term fluctuations in Mytilus galloprovincialis larvae abundance and environmental parameters (water temperature, salinity, wind velocity direction, tidal amplitude and chlorophyll a) were monitored (two to three times a week). Larval cohorts were identified using size-frequency distributions and age estimates compared with larval shell growth Lines. Data were fitted to the linear, exponential, von Bertalanffy and Laird-Gompertz growth models. Larval growth adjusted better to the Laird-Gompertz model (0.525+/-0.073 mu m d(-1); r(2) = 0.768; P < 0.05). Reduction of shell growth after 1 to 1.5 months in the plankton suggests the occurrence, in this period, of a 'delay of metamorphosis' phase.

Because environmental and genetic stress may increase DI, FA has been used to assess the level of stress experienced by, for example, fish. In this study, left-right asymmetry of lapillar otoliths was related to nutritional condition as estimated from RNA/DNA ratios, in order to investigate the utility of FA to detect feeding-related stress in Baltic cod, Gadus morhua L., larvae. Cod larvae in intermediate and good nutritional condition showed similar values of FA, and these were more symmetric than for larvae in poor condition. As increased levels of FA were restricted to larvae in a condition comparable to that of larvae experiencing at least 3 days of starvation in laboratory experiments, it is suggested that FA is an insensitive indicator of short-term feeding success of larval cod. However, FA can be used to reveal severely starved larva populations and probably also populations that have been subjected to prolonged sub-optimal feeding conditions.",,,,,"Grønkjær, Peter/A-3697-2008","Grønkjær, Peter/0000-0003-1337-4661",,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,,,,,JUL,2003,143,1,,,,,191,197,,10.1007/s00227-003-1064-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-003-1064-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000184026900019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, a broad range of zonal soils were collected in forest land at topsoil (0-15 cm) and subsoil (15-30 cm) from temperate to tropical climatic gradient in central to south China. The stock and stability of SOC were determined in terms of aggregate and humic fractionation. SOC in bulk soils with a less significant geographic variation was comparably higher at Haplic Luvisoils in temperate regions (3637.61 g m(-2)) and Rhodi-Humic Ferrosols in tropical regions (3446.12 g m(-2)) than in the other experimental soils, but a consistent decreasing trend was observed along the soil profiles with the SOC stock was 1.11-1.97 times higher in the topsoil than in the subsoils. In addition, insoluble humin residue (HMr) as the dominant components of SOC ranged from 643.95 to 2696.90 g m(-2) and decreased from temperate to tropical regions, which was consistent with the zonal variation of humic acids (HAs), but contrary to the zonal variation of fulvic acids (FAs) that fluctuated in a range of 39.67-389.55 g m(-2) across the experimental sites. According to the results of partial correlation analysis, the variation of FAs stock was significantly attributed to soil pH, bulk density, iron and aluminum oxides, clay, and clay mineral content (vertical bar r vertical bar>0.61, p < 0.05), while these soil physical properties showed a contradictory effects on HAs, iron-linked humin (HMi), clay-combined humin (HMc), and HMr. Moreover, the aggregate-associated carbon stock was mainly stored in macroaggregates (36.34-76.09%) for both SOC and its chemical components, especially in topsoils, and its zonal variation was associated with that of bulk soils. In general, the redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that mean annual precipitation (MAP) accounted for 81.8% and 13.8% of the variance in SOC chemical and physical fractionation, respectively, while the corresponding contribution of mean annual temperature (MAT) was 1.5% and 34.7%. With the increase of MAT and MAP, the chemical stability of SOC decreased in the molecular structure, and the physical protection of SOC by aggregate exhibited a unimodal trend. The obtained results would facilitate the development of regional soil carbon prediction and land management against global warming.

Area of study: The study area was located in a P. ponderosa stand in the northern Rocky Mountains (western Montana, USA). Material and methods: The study was conducted in one stand that had been subjected to a silvicultural study of uneven-aged management techniques that was carried out in 1984, and which resulted in three separate units consisting of one control, one cut/no-burn treatment, and one cut/burn treatment. Seeds were collected during the 10 years following treatment in 15 traps systematically deployed within each of the stand's three units. The total numbers of seeds collected in each unit were plotted over time to analyze crop synchrony, with Spearman rank correlation coefficient used to test for masting cycles and crop depletion after a mast year. Meteorological records over the period 1983-1994 were related to the occurrence of a mast event (defined as crops exceeding 50,000 viable seeds/ha). Main results: The seed production pattern was non-cyclical, synchronous, and independent of silvicultural treatment history. A mast-depletion effect was evident but was not statistically significant. Mast events seem to be promoted by the occurrence of optimum mean temperatures at the beginning of spring during both the first (11 degrees C) and second (9 degrees C) years of cone maturation. The probability of a mast year was also affected by summer temperature (number of late frost days; negative effect) and precipitation amount (positive effect). All these factors would seemingly explain the observed synchronous pattern in cone production. Research highlights: The non-cyclical trend of ponderosa pine seed mast years is influenced by specific climate determinants. Fluctuations in mean early spring temperatures, late frost and water availability are likely to affect P. ponderosa seed production, with implications for natural regeneration in this region.",,,,,"Manso, Rubén/AAL-9770-2021; Manso, Rubén/J-8257-2016","Manso, Rubén/0000-0003-0667-8392",,,,,,,,,,,,,2171-5068,2171-9845,,,,,2015,24,1,,,,,,,,10.5424/fs/2015241-05606,http://dx.doi.org/10.5424/fs/2015241-05606,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000357275200021,View Full Record in Web of Science

FRB in the uppermost 15 cm of the surface-soil layer accounted for 41-61% of the biomass up to 60 cm soil depth, and decreased with increasing soil depth. The biomass of fine roots with root diameters <0.5 mm was almost equivalent to that of roots measuring 0.5-2 mm in diameter. Sasa roots accounted for 59-88% of the total FRB. FRB did not fluctuate seasonally, whereas RLD did. The FRP rate was high in mid- to late summer and correlated significantly with air and soil temperatures, indicating that temperature affects FRP. However, the relationship between FRP and soil moisture was weak. FRP was significantly correlated with the PAI of oak trees and the increment in the PAI of Sasa, suggesting that endogenous factors also affect FRP. Depending on the method used to calculate turnover, mean FRP for the 3-year study period was 589 or 726 g m(2) yr(-1), accounting for 36% or 41% of forest net primary production, respectively. The results of this study illustrate the substantial seasonal and interannual fluctuations in FRP, and indicate that a significant proportion of assimilated carbon was allocated to below-ground root systems in an oak-Sasa stand.

Despite mounting evidence for viral contributions to these processes in peatlands underlain with permafrost, little is known about viruses in other peatlands. More generally, soil viral biogeography and its potential drivers are poorly understood at both local and global scales. Here, 87 metagenomes and five viral size-fraction metagenomes (viromes) from a boreal peatland in northern Minnesota (the SPRUCE whole-ecosystem warming experiment and surrounding bog) were analyzed for dsDNA viral community ecological patterns, and the recovered viral populations (vOTUs) were compared with our curated PIGEON database of 266,125 vOTUs from diverse ecosystems. Results: Within the SPRUCE experiment, viral community composition was significantly correlated with peat depth, water content, and carbon chemistry, including CH4 and CO2 concentrations, but not with temperature during the first 2 years of warming treatments. Peat vOTUs with aquatic-like signatures (shared predicted protein content with marine and/or freshwater vOTUs) were significantly enriched in more waterlogged surface peat depths. Predicted host ranges for SPRUCE vOTUs were relatively narrow, generally within a single bacterial genus. Of the 4326 SPRUCE vOTUs, 164 were previously detected in other soils, mostly peatlands. None of the previously identified 202,371 marine and freshwater vOTUs in our PIGEON database were detected in SPRUCE peat, but 0.4% of 80,714 viral clusters (VCs, grouped by predicted protein content) were shared between soil and aquatic environments. On a per-sample basis, vOTU recovery was 32 times higher from viromes compared with total metagenomes. Conclusions: Results suggest strong viral species boundaries between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and to some extent between peat and other soils, with differences less pronounced at higher taxonomic levels. The significant enrichment of aquatic-like vOTUs in more waterlogged peat suggests that viruses may also exhibit niche partitioning on more local scales. These patterns are presumably driven in part by host ecology, consistent with the predicted narrow host ranges. Although more samples and increased sequencing depth improved vOTU recovery from total metagenomes, the substantially higher per-sample vOTU recovery after viral particle enrichment highlights the utility of soil viromics.",,,,,"Trubl, Gareth/L-7977-2019; , Jennifer Pett RIdge/AFF-7780-2022; , Jennifer Pett RIdge/AAE-9934-2022; Hanson, Paul J./D-8069-2011","Trubl, Gareth/0000-0001-5008-1476; Hanson, Paul J./0000-0001-7293-3561; ter Horst, Anneliek/0000-0001-8722-7037; Blazewicz, Steven/0000-0001-7517-1750; Pett-Ridge, Jennifer/0000-0002-4439-2398",,,,,,,,,,,,,2049-2618,,,,,NOV 26,2021,9,1,,,,,,,233,10.1186/s40168-021-01156-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40168-021-01156-0,,,,,,,,34836550,,,,,WOS:000722896800002,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Belarde, TA; Railsback, SF",,,,"Belarde, Tyler A.; Railsback, Steven F.",,,New predictions from old theory: Emergent effects of multiple stressors in a model of piscivorous fish,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Predicting cumulative effects is an important challenge of theoretical and management ecology. If a population will be exposed to multiple stressors (e.g., toxins, introduced competitors, climate change), will their cumulative effects be independent and hence multiplicative (the population survival rates due to each stressor can be multiplied together to determine the total reduction in abundance), synergistic (cumulative effects are greater than multiplicative), or antagonistic (stressors offset each other so cumulative effects are less than multiplicative)? Further, the effects of each stressor can vary with such factors as habitat quality, population density, and weather. It is difficult to predict cumulative effects with traditional population-level models because such models must assume the type and strength of stressor interactions a priori, and measuring stressor effects and interactions empirically is rarely practical. Instead, we used an individual-based model in which cumulative effects emerge from how each stressor affects the growth and survival of individuals, and how individuals interact. Our model is in fact based on theoretical concepts explored in the landmark 1980 paper of DeAngelis et al. (Cannibalism and size dispersal in young-of-the-year largemouth bass: experiment and model, Ecol. Model. 8, 133-148): in a community of fish that eat each other, initial differences in size among individuals have strong effects on subsequent abundance and size distributions. We model survival and growth of juvenile Colorado pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus lucius) during their first year, and two stressors they are subject to. The first stressor is a daily cycle of flow fluctuations imposed by an upstream hydroelectric dam; these fluctuations affect habitat area, food supply, and temperature, which then affect juvenile fish growth. Second is an introduced fish species that competes with pikeminnow for food, while both species can prey on each other via the size-based mechanism described by DeAngelis et al. We simulated the effects of the 36 combinations of six levels of these two stressors in each of 28 sites and weather year to produce 840 scenarios, using 7 weather year datasets as replicates. Emergent cumulative effects were multiplicative in 69% of these scenarios, synergistic in 22%, and antagonistic in 9%. Therefore, any a priori assumption about stressor interactions would be wrong in many situations. Synergistic effects were most common in deeper and larger habitats favorable to the introduced species; antagonistic effects were most common in smaller habitats where the introduced species had low growth, because flow fluctuations further reduced the small food supply.

This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate-growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate-growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.",,,,,"Manthey, Michael/L-2586-2019; Wilmking, Martin/AAV-9310-2020","Wilmking, Martin/0000-0003-4964-2402; Scharnweber, Tobias/0000-0002-4933-5296",,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,APR,2013,33,4,,,,,425,437,,10.1093/treephys/tpt020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpt020,,,,,,,,23564694,,,,,WOS:000318574000010,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Palmer, CV",,,,"Palmer, Caroline, V",,,Warmer Water Affects Immunity of a Tolerant Reef Coral,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Corals are multipartite sedentary organisms, which have evolved complex, physiological networks in order to survive perturbations and environmental fluctuations. However, climate change is warming tropical waters, pushing the limits of coral tolerance and driving global declines. Coral susceptibility to thermal anomalies is variable among species and through time, and directly relates to constituent immunity. Constituent immunity refers to immune activities required to ensure homeostasis, whereas an immune response is acutely heightened immune activity to a perturbation. Understanding the mechanisms behind coral health, and sustained health through adverse conditions, is increasingly important for establishing effective reef conservation and restoration projects. However, most experimental studies of coral health use species that are highly susceptible to thermal events, potentially skewing our understanding. To determine the influence of warmer water on immunity, activities of key coral immune pathways and an antioxidant were compared under ambient (27 degrees C) and warmer water (32 degrees C), and between injured and uninjured (control) branches of the tolerant reef coral Porites cylindrica. Three types of phenoloxidase, mono-phenoloxidase, ortho-diphenoloxidase and para-diphenloxidase, indicative of two melanin synthesis pathways (the tyrosinase and laccase-type), and peroxidase were measured at 0 (control), 1, 6, 24, 48, and 168 h post-injury. All four enzymes demonstrated consistent levels of activity under ambient conditions (27 degrees C), indicating constituent immunity. Upon injury at ambient temperature, all enzyme activities were significantly higher 1 h post-injury as compared to uninjured controls, demonstrating a comprehensive immune response to tissue disruption. Under warmer water, constituent immunity increased through time indicative of immune modulation to maintain homeostasis. However, warmer water, within the non-bleaching summer range, suppressed the immune response to injury, delaying it by 24 h. Therefore, upon the environmental cue of warmer water, the tolerant coral P cylindrica may divert resources away from immune responses (immunosuppression) while enhancing constituent immunity (immune modulation) so as to maintain health through sub-optimal conditions. These changes in immunity with warmer water demonstrate that temperature affects coral immunity and, for this tolerant coral, triggers immune-modulation that may provide cross-tolerance to perturbations more frequent in summer months, such as bleaching and disease.",,,,,"Palmer, Caroline/B-6498-2011","Palmer, Caroline/0000-0002-5903-995X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,JUL 18,2018,5,,,,,,,,253,10.3389/fmars.2018.00253,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00253,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000457179100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The instruments, originally developed for ocean surface wave research, were used to investigate ice and water motions in the near-lead environment, as well as to collect preliminary acoustic data required in the design of a more capable leadside sonar. The sonars could determine lead geometry with great accuracy, identifying regions of open water and young ice. Opening and closing speeds of the lead ice cover could be measured to 0.01 cm s(-1) using pulse-to-pulse coherent techniques. The flow velocity of the water just beneath the ice, of order 1-10 cm s(-1), was estimated using pulse-to-pulse incoherent processing. Perhaps surprisingly, the strongest acoustic returns from the lead surface came from regions of open water, not ice cover. Frazil ice was a likely source of this scattering, although temperature microstructure might also play a role. On the basis of the 1991 measurements, a 28-beam sector scan Doppler sonar was developed for use in the LEADEX main field experiment (March-April 1992). With the fan of beams oriented in a vertical plane the sonar formed an image of the velocity field over a 45 degrees sector, to ranges of 250 m, depths of 200 m. The instrument was deployed at LEADEX lead 3 on April 8-9. At this point a significant ice cover had developed, limiting local convective forcing. The dominant motions observed beneath the lead were near-inertial internal waves. Significant variability in acoustic scattering was observed at the base of the mixed layer and in the upper thermocline. This presumably resulted from strong temperature and salinity fluctuations observed at these depths. The near-inertial modulation of the ice water relative velocity affects the transit time of water parcels under a lead. Probability density functions of parcel transit time have extremely high kurtosis, for mean transit times less than an inertial day. Resultant distributions of near-surface properties such as salt uptake or primary production will thus be extremely patchy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,MAR 15,1995,100,C3,,,,,4693,4705,,10.1029/94JC02540,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94JC02540,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QN00900033,View Full Record in Web of Science

The understanding of the soil moisture and heat distribution is important for assessing the fate and transport of contaminants for the waste-burial site in a desert setting. A coupled water, vapor, and heat flow model was used in this study for evaluating the interactions of these processes and their influence on the moisture dynamics in the Amargosa Desert Research Site (ADRS) in southern Nevada. The treatment of preferential flow was also included in the model. Data from a previously conducted tracer experiment were used for estimating initial parameters of preferential flux and the parameters in pedotransfer functions (PTFs), while the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used to optimize various parameters in the model calibration on the basis of the observation data. After the model calibration, three-year simulations (1998-2000) were conducted for evaluating the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture and temperature in the site. The simulation results show that the performance of thermal model with vapor and preferential flow is close to those of isothermal model without vapor and preferential flow as compared with the observed records in ADRS, while critical physical mechanisms could be well described with the thermal model. The vapor flow for the water budget on the upper boundary is insignificant while it influences the water content distribution in the soil profile; the wetting front depth of preferential flow and water budget has increased in rain days; however, the high evaporation counteracts it in the annual water budget. The thermal diffusion of water vapor and thermal liquid fluxes were affected by temperature fluctuation and soil water saturation status. Comparison between the flux components shows that the thermal driven flux has more weight on the water movement in the soil profile. Results indicate that the coupled flow and thermal model could well describe the natural condition in arid regions and is more efficient in simulating mutual effects among various processes.

Variation in climate is predicted to increase over much of the planet this century. Forecasting species persistence with climate change thus requires understanding of how populations respond to climate variability, and the mechanisms underlying this response. Variable rainfall is well known to drive fluctuations in annual plant populations, yet the degree to which population response is driven by between-year variation in germination cueing, water limitation or competitive suppression is poorly understood. 2. We used demographic monitoring and population models to examine how three seed banking, rare annual plants of the California Channel Islands respond to natural variation in precipitation and their competitive environments. Island plants are particularly threatened by climate change because their current ranges are unlikely to overlap regions that are climatically favourable in the future. 3. Species showed 9 to 100-fold between-year variation in plant density over the 5-12 years of censusing, including a severe drought and a wet El Nino year. During the drought, population sizes were low for all species. However, even in non-drought years, population sizes and per capita growth rates showed considerable temporal variation, variation that was uncorrelated with total rainfall. These population fluctuations were instead correlated with the temperature after the first major storm event of the season, a germination cue for annual plants. 4. Temporal variation in the density of the focal species was uncorrelated with the total vegetative cover in the surrounding community, suggesting that variation in competitive environments does not strongly determine population fluctuations. At the same time, the uncorrelated responses of the focal species and their competitors to environmental variation may favour persistence via the storage effect. 5. Population growth rate analyses suggested differential endangerment of the focal annuals. Elasticity analyses and life table response experiments indicated that variation in germination has the same potential as the seeds produced per germinant to drive variation in population growth rates, but only the former was clearly related to rainfall. 6. Synthesis. Our work suggests that future changes in the timing and temperatures associated with the first major rains, acting through germination, may more strongly affect population persistence than changes in season-long rainfall.",,,,,"Levine, Jonathan/A-7167-2014","Levine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2857-7904",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,,,,,JUL,2008,96,4,,,,,795,806,,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01375.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01375.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000256635800025,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three different methods of calculating the Kuroshio transport are employed and compared. These methods include 1) a direct'' method that uses conventional interpolation of the measured currents and extrapolation to the surface and bottom to estimate the current structure, 2) a dynamic height'' method in which moored temperature measurements from moorings on opposite sides of the channel are used to estimate dynamic height differences across the current and spatially averaged baroclinic transport profiles, and 3) an adjusted geostrophic'' method in which all moored temperature measurements within the array are used to estimate a relative geostrophic velocity field that is referenced and adjusted by the available direct current measurements. The first two methods are largely independent and are shown to produce very similar transport results. The latter two methods are particularly useful in situations where direct current measurements may have marginal resolution for accurate transport estimates. These methods should be generally applicable in other settings and illustrate the benefits of including a dynamic height measuring capability as a backup for conventional direct transport calculations. The mean transport of the Kuroshio over the 20-month duration of the experiment ranges from 20.7 to 22.1 Sv (1 Sv = 10(6) m(3) s(-1)) for the three methods, or within 1.3 Sv of each other.

All methods show a similar range of variability of +/-10 Sv with dominant timescales of several months. Fluctuations in the transport are shown to have a robust vertical structure, with over 90% of the transport variance explained by a single vertical mode.

The field experiment was carried out with five main treatments, three cover crops of hairy vetch (HV), lacy phacelia (LF) and white mustard (WM) transplanted in autumn and cut in May to be used as mulches, plus barley straw mulch (BS) and conventional (C) (bare soil). After tomato transplanting, the main plots were split into two nitrogen fertilization treatments (0 and 100 kg N ha(-1)) and the sub-plots were then split again into three irrigation levels (irrigation water 100%, 75%, 50% of evapotranspiration). In all treatments, a general effect was observed in the temporal fluctuations of soil CO2 emissions throughout the observation period which were significantly influenced by soil temperature and water content. The temporal fluctuations of the soil CO2 emissions were attributed to climatic conditions and the peaks achieved optimal conditions of soil temperature and water content for soil respiration. A larger amount of TOC was observed in the mulching treatments than in the control after tomato harvesting (on average 1.44% vs 1.33%, respectively and on average 1.43% in HV trastment), probably due to the residual biomass of the cover crops and a greater growth of the tomato. Although the soil carbon output as cumulated CO2 emissions did not show statistically significant differences between the treatments, the soil carbon balance enabled us to estimate the highest net carbon contribution to the soil in HV determined by inputs and input/output ratio. However, except for the BS in 2013, the input/output ratios were >1 in all mulch treatments. In the Mediterranean environment, agronomical practices, such as the use of hairy vetch mulch on notilled soil, a slight reduction of irrigation water (-25%) and a rationalized use of N fertilizer potentially could shift the C balance in favor of soil C accumulation.

The experiment was performed during 1998-2001 in twelve-year-old apricot trees (Prunus armeniaca L., cv. Bulida), growing under field conditions in Murcia, Spain (semi-arid climate, with 1500 mm average annual evaporation and 350 mm rainfall) in a clay loam texture soil (128 mm m(-1) available soil water content and 1.45 Mg m(-3) bulk density). Trees were submitted to two drip irrigated treatments: a control treatment irrigated at 100% of seasonal ETc and a water deficit treatment (WD) irrigated at 50% of the control treatment. The diurnal courses of leaf water potentials, leaf conductance, net photosynthesis, leaf temperature, sap flow and trunk diameter fluctuations were studied throughout one growing season. The deficit treatment showed stomatal regulation as an adaptive mechanisms to drought, which allows plants to regulate water loss more effectively. Leaf temperature values were higher in WD than in the control treatment, and acted as a good stress indicator. Net photosynthesis showed a good correlation with leaf conductance values. In deficit irrigation conditions, osmotic adjustment was not observed. Both leaf water potential and gas exchange parameters were well correlated with evaporative demand of the atmosphere. Trunk diameters oscillate over a 24-h cycle, reaching a maximum value just before sunrise and a minimum sometime in the afternoon. The difference between maximum and minimum values is termed maximum daily shrinkage (MDS). This parameter increased in WD plants during the first period of the growing season, however, when the water stress was accumulated (in the last period of the growing season), MDS shown an important decrease in the water stressed plants respect to the irrigated ones. The sap flow values were lower in the deficit than in the control treatment throughout the growing season, although the greatest differences were observed in spring.

However, landscape morphology can modify the availability of resources from year to year by imposing physical gradients that redistribute soil water and other biophysical variables within ecosystems. This article demonstrates that the well-established biophysical relationship between soil respiration and soil moisture interacts with topographic structure to create bidirectional (i.e., opposite) responses of soil respiration to inter-annual soil water availability within the landscape. Based on soil respiration measurements taken at a subalpine forest in central Montana, we found that locations with high drainage areas (i.e., lowlands and wet areas of the forest) had higher cumulative soil respiration in dry years, whereas locations with low drainage areas (i.e., uplands and dry areas of the forest) had higher cumulative soil respiration in wet years. Our results indicate that for 80.9% of the forest soil respiration is likely to increase during wet years, whereas for 19.1% of the forest soil respiration is likely to decrease under the same hydrologic conditions. This emergent, bidirectional behavior is generated from the interaction of three relatively simple elements (parabolic soil biophysics, the relative distribution of landscape positions, and inter-annual climate variability), indicating that terrain complexity is an important mediator of the landscape-scale soil C response to climate. These results highlight that evaluating and predicting ecosystem-scale soil C response to climate fluctuation requires detailed characterization of biophysical-topographic interactions in addition to biophysical-climate interactions.",,,,,"Emanuel, Ryan E/C-3796-2012; McGlynn, Brian/A-2509-2008","Emanuel, Ryan E/0000-0002-2166-1698; McGlynn, Brian/0000-0001-5266-4894",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,FEB,2012,18,2,,,,,749,756,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02556.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02556.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000299042500029,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Burnaford, JL",,,,"Burnaford, JL",,,Habitat modification and refuge from sublethal stress drive a marine plant-herbivore association,ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Canopy-forming plants and algae, in addition to their role as food, can positively affect higher trophic levels by providing protection from predation or stressful abiotic conditions. In the low rocky intertidal zone of the Pacific Northwest, the chiton Katharina tunicata is closely associated with the canopy-forming alga Hedophyllum sessile. In a 27-month field experiment, I used experimental devices to mimic characteristics of the Hedophyllum canopy and monitored the abundance and physiology of Katharina to determine the mechanism behind this association. The data show that this association is due to selection of shaded microhabitats by Katharina, and that neither predation nor Hedophyllum per se influenced the distribution of the chiton. Exclusion of visual predators had no effect on chiton abundance, and tests of the effects of shade independent of Hedophyllum presence indicated that the shade produced by the alga was critical to the chiton. Seasonal fluctuations in levels of 70 kDa 0.16 X 10(-19) g) heat shock proteins (Hsp70), indicate that Katharina experience sublethal physiological stress during the spring and summer. The corresponding use of shaded areas during spring and summer low tides suggests that the chiton's distribution is limited during these seasons by the availability of refugia from sublethal abiotic stresses. Subtle variations in environmental conditions are also important to this association; the strength of the positive interaction varied annually, becoming more positive in warm summers (1998 and 2000) and neutral in a cooler summer (1999). On a finer scale, physiological measurements indicate that the response of chitons to summertime temperatures depends on both absolute temperature change and the animal's recent thermal history. In particular, the seasonal onset of daytime low tides in the spring is associated with increased Hsp70 levels, indicating that this is a significant physiological event for Katharina. The importance of facultative positive interactions that allow consumers to escape from sublethal abiotic stresses will likely be variable in time but can have large impacts on communities both by affecting the small-scale distribution of consumers over the short term and potentially by affecting the persistence of organisms over the long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,OCT,2004,85,10,,,,,2837,2849,,10.1890/03-0113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-0113,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000224844700023,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, their impacts and links to terrestrial water storage (TWS) in general, have not been studied. This study presents the pioneer results of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of TWS derived from both global reanalysis data (1980-2015) and GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) (2002-2014) with SST fields. The main issues discussed include, (i) oceanic hot spots that impact on TWS over tropical West Africa (TWA) based on CCA, (ii) long term changes in model and global reanalysis data (soil moisture, TWS, and groundwater) and the influence of climate variability on these hydrological indicators, and (iii) the hydrological characteristics of the Equatorial region of Africa (i.e., the Congo basin) based on GRACE-derived TWS, river discharge, and precipitation. Results of the CCA diagnostics show that El-Nino Southern Oscillation related equatorial Pacific SST fluctuations is a major index of climate variability identified in the main portion of the CCA procedure that indicates a significant association with long term TWS reanalysis data over TWA (r = 0.50, p < 0.05). Based on Mann-Kendall's statistics, the study found fairly large long term declines (p < 0.05) in TWS and soil moisture (1982 - 2015), mostly over the Congo basin, which coincided with warming of the land surface and the surrounding oceans. Meanwhile, some parts of the Sahel show significant wetting (rainfall, soil moisture, groundwater, and TWS) trends during the same period (1982-2015) and aligns with the ongoing narratives of rainfall recovery in the region. Results of singular spectral analysis and regression confirm that multi-annual changes in the Congo River discharge explained a considerable proportion of variability in GRACE-hydrological signal over the Congo basin (r = 0.86 and R-2 = 0.70, p < 0.05).

However, recent discoveries of diverse and high cover reefs that already live under extreme conditions suggest that some corals might thrive well under hot, high-pCO(2), and deoxygenated seawater. Volcanic CO2 vents, semi-enclosed lagoons, and mangrove estuaries are unique study sites where one or more ecologically relevant parameters for life in the oceans are close to or even worse than currently projected for the year 2100. Although they do not perfectly mimic future conditions, these natural laboratories offer unique opportunities to explore the mechanisms that reef species could use to keep pace with climate change. To achieve this, it is essential to characterize their environment as a whole and accurately consider all possible environmental factors that may differ from what is expected in the future, possibly altering the ecosystem response. This study focuses on the semi-enclosed lagoon of Bourake (New Caledonia, southwest Pacific Ocean) where a healthy reef ecosystem thrives in warm, acidified, and deoxygenated water. We used a multi-scale approach to characterize the main physical-chemical parameters and mapped the benthic community composition (i.e., corals, sponges, and macroalgae). The data revealed that most physical and chemical parameters are regulated by the tide, strongly fluctuate three to four times a day, and are entirely predictable. The seawater pH and dissolved oxygen decrease during falling tide and reach extreme low values at low tide (7.2 pH(T) and 1.9 mg O-2 L-1 at Bourake vs. 7.9 pH(T) and 5.5 mg O-2 L(-1 )at reference reefs). Dissolved oxygen, temperature, and pH fluctuate according to the tide by up to 4.91 mg O-2 L-1, 6.50 degrees C, and 0.69 pH(T) units on a single day. Furthermore, the concentration of most of the chemical parameters was 1 to 5 times higher at the Bourake lagoon, particularly for organic and inorganic carbon and nitrogen but also for some nutrients, notably silicates. Surprisingly, despite extreme environmental conditions and altered seawater chemical composition measured at Bourake, our results reveal a diverse and high cover community of macroalgae, sponges, and corals accounting for 28, 11, and 66 species, respectively. Both environmental variability and nutrient imbalance might contribute to their survival under such extreme environmental conditions.

A survey of 14 small Alpine lakes located between 1900 and 2400 in a.s.l. in Italy resulted in the discovery of 17 species of Hydrachnidia and a single species of freshwater Halacaridae. Arrenurus conicus and Lebertia tuberosa were the most widespread and abundant species; Lebertia sefvei, Lebertia rufipes, Oxus setosus, Panisus torrenticolus and Sperchon glandulosus were also widely distributed but relatively less abundant. Atractides fissus and Arrenurus conicus are recorded for the first time from Italy. In contrast to mid/low elevation lakes and ponds, water mite assemblages of alpine lakes are less diverse and are composed mainly of rheo- and crenobiontic taxa, most of which are cold-stenothermic. Typical standing water dwellers represented only a small fraction (23%) of the species sampled.

However, the degree to which freshwater plants can survive after long-term or short-term warming and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. The aim of our study was to analyze the responses of an invasive plant to moderate heat stress (HS). Biochemical and physiological stress responses to experimental warming (30 +/- 1.0 degrees C/25 +/- 1.0 degrees C, day/night) were assessed in the invasive waterweed Elodea canadensis. The effect of the moderate HS on the macrophyte was evaluated through changes in the total protein content, catalase activity, lipid peroxidation, cellular membrane permeability by electrolyte leakage and the concentrations of carotenoids and photosynthetic pigments. Catalase activity and carotenoid concentrations increased significantly (p<0.01) in comparison to the control. A significant increase (p<0.05) in malondialdehyde concentration was observed. However, at the same time there was a persistent low level of electrolyte leakage in heat-treated plants as compared to the control. The results demonstrated that moderate HS improved membrane stability and increased the concentration of photosynthetic pigments and antioxidant activity in E. canadensis shoots. Moderate alterations in temperature may favorably affect the physiology and growth of the invasive macrophyte E. canadensis. It is reasonable to expect that warming could lead to a gradual change in E. canadensis distribution and to changes in composition of freshwater ecosystems.",,,,,"Petjukevics, Aleksandrs/AAD-4548-2020","Petjukevics, Aleksandrs/0000-0001-6917-2677; Skute, Natalja/0000-0002-3584-0347",,,,,,,,,,,,,0354-4664,1821-4339,,,,,2018,70,3,,,,,551,557,,10.2298/ABS180119016S,http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ABS180119016S,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000442207900016,View Full Record in Web of Science

We conducted comparative analyses of the biophysical and ecophysiological properties of the two distinct diaspores (mucilaginous seed (M+) vs indehiscent (IND) fruit) in the dimorphic annual Aethionema arabicum (Brassicaceae), linking fruit biomechanics, dispersal aerodynamics, pericarp-imposed dormancy, diaspore abscisic acid (ABA) concentration, and phenotypic plasticity of dimorphic diaspore production to its natural habitat and climate. Two very contrasting dispersal mechanisms of the A. arabicum dimorphic diaspores were revealed. Dehiscence of large fruits leads to the release of M+ seed diaspores, which adhere to substrata via seed coat mucilage, thereby preventing dispersal (antitelechory). IND fruit diaspores (containing nonmucilaginous seeds) disperse by wind or water currents, promoting dispersal (telechory) over a longer range. The pericarp properties confer enhanced dispersal ability and degree of dormancy on the IND fruit morph to support telechory, while the M+ seed morph supports antitelechory. Combined with the phenotypic plasticity to produce more IND fruit diaspores in colder temperatures, this constitutes a bet-hedging survival strategy to magnify the prevalence in response to selection pressures acting over hilly terrain.",,,,,"Leubner, Gerhard/A-1999-2013","Leubner, Gerhard/0000-0002-6045-8713; Nichols, Bethany/0000-0003-1280-2070; Mummenhoff, Klaus/0000-0002-8449-1593; Jansen, Vincent A.A./0000-0002-6518-2090; Arshad, Waheed/0000-0002-9413-2279",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-646X,1469-8137,,,,FEB,2019,221,3,,,,,1434,1446,,10.1111/nph.15490,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.15490,,,,,,,,30230555,,,,,WOS:000459828900026,View Full Record in Web of Science

There were significant seasonal fluctuations in the distribution of the species in the region, resulting from variation in bottom temperature. The presence of the South Atlantic Central Water (S Lambda CW) favors the decrease in the abundance of N. schmitti and highest abundance of E. oplophoroides.

Based on the adaptive modulation hypothesis and the principle of optimal gut function design, we hypothesize that the gut size, tissue-specific activity, and total hydrolytic capacity of intestinal digestive enzyme are upregulated in winter and downregulated in summer in response to diet shifts and energy demand in free-living Mongolian gerbils. Various seasonal modulation patterns in digestive enzyme activity in different regions of the small intestines were observed. The results show that male gerbils have the longest and heaviest small intestines in winter. This mechanism may be adapted to increase their food intake during winter. Male gerbils also exhibit the highest tissue-specific and total sucrase, maltase, and aminopeptidase-N activity in winter and in spring.

Mey., a rare alpine subnival plant surviving in cold regions, the rebalance of redox state of cellular ubiquinone is very active in early chilling stress. We examined the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by using flow cytometry and the level of reductive ubiquinone through HPLC in suspension-cultured cells of C. bungeana, so as to investigate the cellular activity under different low temperature. It was found that compared with 25 degrees C, the level of reductive ubiquinone kept decreasing under different chilling temperature. Meanwhile, chilling induction cannot impair cell activity since MMP kept stabilizing under early chilling and the accumulation of ROS production did not fluctuate at the same time. These findings suggested that the special mechanism of chilling-resistance in the alpine subtrival plant is tightly linked with redox balance of its cellular redox molecule and, in early chilling, the redox transition of ubiquinone cannot only ensure the fluency of electron transfer in mitochondria but also facilitate the regulation of the whole-cell redox states leading to adaptation of cellular regulations.

Year-to-year variations in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate are mostly due to fluctuating carbon uptake by land ecosystems(1). The sensitivity of these fluctuations to changes in tropical temperature has been well documented(2-6), but identifying the role of global water availability has proved to be elusive. So far, the only usable proxies for water availability have been time-lagged precipitation anomalies and drought indices(3-5), owing to a lack of direct observations. Here, we use recent observations of terrestrial water storage changes derived from satellite gravimetry(7) to investigate terrestrial water effects on carbon cycle variability at global to regional scales. We show that the CO2 growth rate is strongly sensitive to observed changes in terrestrial water storage, drier years being associated with faster atmospheric CO2 growth. We demonstrate that this global relationship is independent of known temperature effects and is underestimated in current carbon cycle models.

Effects of the area and volume constraint coefficients on elastic and mechanical properties of RBC membrane were studied by conducting numerical experiments. The dependence of the membrane properties on various microstructure parameters and temperature was also studied. Finally, we investigated the mechanical response of the RBC membrane when subjected to tensile, shear and area dilation loading conditions using a representative microstructure. The results obtained shows that the elastic and mechanical properties of the membrane vary with increase in area and volume constraint coefficients; it also shows that these elastic and mechanical properties are affected by temperature and membrane microstructure parameters, which also influence the response of the membrane under various loading conditions.

Correlations have been established between these flavor attributes with variations in air and soil temperatures, photosynthetically active radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, and rainfall, during the growing season. While genotype was the major source of phenotypic variation for pH, titratable acidity and sugar/acid ratio, the total soluble solids content was more dependent on environmental conditions during production than on genotype. Fluctuations in soil and air temperatures, in particular, were found to significantly influence the total soluble solids content of strawberries. Furthermore, the effect of genotype was, for many volatile compounds, stronger than that of the environment. The genotype-by-environment interactions were highly significant for the four quality parameters, as well as for a majority of the volatile compounds.

While several climatic fluctuation patterns influence the dynamics and biological productivity of the CCS, including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (PDO) and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), the mechanisms of interaction between climatic oscillations and the CCS upwelling dynamics have remained obscure. Here, we use Singular Spectral Analysis (SSA) to reveal, for the first time, low-frequency concordance between the time series of climatic indices and upwelling intensity along the coast of western North America. Based on energy distributions in annual, semiannual and low-frequency signals, we can divide the coast into three distinct regions. While the annual upwelling signal dominates the energy spectrum elsewhere, low-frequency variability is maximal in the regions south of 33 degrees N. Non-structured variability associated with storms and turbulent mixing is enhanced at northerly locations. We found that the low-frequency signal is significantly correlated with different climatic indices such as PDO, NPGO and ENSO with the correlation patterns being latitude-dependent. We also analyzed the correlations between this upwelling variability and sea surface temperature (SST) and sea level pressure (SLP) throughout the North Pacific to visualize and interpret the large-scale teleconnection dynamics in the atmosphere that drive the low-frequency coastal winds. These results provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms connecting climatic patterns with upwelling dynamics, which could enhance our prediction and forecast capabilities of the effects of future oceanographic and climatic variability in the CCS.",,,,,"Macías, Diego/G-1972-2010","Macías, Diego/0000-0002-7772-255X; Miller, Arthur/0000-0003-3459-2676",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JAN 19,2012,7,1,,,,,,,e30436,10.1371/journal.pone.0030436,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030436,,,,,,,,22276199,,,,,WOS:000301457200061,View Full Record in Web of Science

Control relies mainly on synthetic pesticides, but biological control using entomopathogenic fungi may provide an alternative strategy. We evaluated sixteen fungal isolates in total; three of Beauveria bassiana, two of Metarhizium anisopliae, three of Isaria fumosorosea (Group 1); and eight isolates of Hirsutella citriformis (Group 2). The in vitro growth, germination (after different incubation times) and sporulation were assessed for all isolates at four temperatures: 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Overall, the Group 1 isolates achieved the greatest growth, germination rate and sporulation compared with the H. citriformis isolates In Group 2. Among the Group 1 isolates, B1, M2 and I1 had the greatest performance in the biological attributes evaluated. Group 2 isolates were not competitive under in vitro assessment; however, they cannot be dismissed entirely until in vivo experiments are done as this species was the most common pathogen infecting ACP in the field.

These scintillations are related to turbulent fluctuations of temperature and humidity that are in turn related to surface heat fluxes. We developed an approach that quantifies these scintillations by estimating C-n2 from surface fluxes that are derived from single-level routine weather data. In contrast to previous methods that are biased to dry and warm air, our method is directly applicable to several land surface types, environmental conditions, wavelengths, and measurement heights (lookup tables for a limited number of site-specific parameters are provided). The approach allows for an efficient evaluation of the performance of, e.g., infrared imaging systems, laser geodetic systems, and ground-to-satellite optical communication systems. We tested our approach for two grass fields in central and southern Europe, and for a wheat field in central Europe. Although there are uncertainties in the flux estimates, the impact on C-n2 is shown to be rather small. The C-n2 daytime estimates agree well with values determined from eddy covariance measurements for the application to the three fields. However, some adjustments were needed for the approach for the grass in southern Europe because of non-negligible boundary-layer processes that occur in addition to surface-layer processes.

Hitherto, research has mainly focused on how CO2 and insolation changes control an equilibrated AIS. However, transient AIS dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here, we study Miocene AIS variability, using an ice sheet-shelf model forced by climate model output with various CO2 levels and orbital conditions. Besides equilibrium simulations, we conduct transient experiments, gradually changing the forcing climate state over time. We show that transient AIS variability is substantially smaller than equilibrium differences. This reduces the contribution of the AIS to delta O-18 fluctuations by more than two thirds on a 40-kyr timescale, hence requiring a larger contribution by deep-sea-temperature variability. The growth rates are much slower than the decay rates, which ensures variability around a preferred small state.

Series of Vertical profiles were obtained using the microstructure profiler MSS86, which is capable of measuring high resolution profiles of temperature, conductivity, current shear, light attenuation and pressure down to the seafloor. The near bottom current structure was simultaneously measured with conventional current metres at fixed depths. A typical vertical density structure of the near bottom layer was found. At all investigation sites the Bottom Boundary Layer was separated from the overlying water mass by a well pronounced thermohaline pycnocline. A homogeneous water layer was situated above the bottom with a mean thickness of 2.2 m and typical variation between 0.5 and 3.5 m. The thickness of both the homogeneous layer and of the near bottom layer vary considerably It is suggested that horizontal advection is responsible for these fluctuations in thickness. The variation in thickness of the Homogeneous Layer is independent of the local mean current velocity, wind speed and energy dissipation rate. Over periods of about 2 days the thickness of the Homogeneous Layer is determined by the average wind speed. The Bottom Boundary Layer shows its own characteristic dynamic, which is largely decoupled from that of the remaining water body. A logarithmic layer was generally not resolved by the current measurements. From dissipation rate measurements, the wall layer was determined to be 0.9 m thick. There was no significant correlation between the dissipation rate and the local wind speed, or between the dissipation rate and local mean current u(100). This means that any simple parameterisation relating rr,,, or friction velocity to the locally produced turbulence and consequently to the resuspension of sediment is probably not applicable to shallow sea areas with properties like the Western Baltic. The investigation of sediment concentration in the BBL illustrates the importance of local effects combined with advection. The sediment stratified layer covers only the bottom most 50 cm.

In the snails used here (Dutch strain), a single 0.5 h training session (TS) results in intermediate-term (3 h) but not long-term memory (LTM). Applying the thermal stressor during training caused memory enhancement (i.e. LTM lasting 24 h). However, the breathing rate also increased in warm water, which might explain the enhanced memory. Therefore, we applied the thermal stressor (1 h at 30 degrees C) up to 4 h before or 1 h after training. This did not alter baseline breathing rate during the period when snails would experience training. However, the thermal stressor whether experienced prior to or following the single TS, resulted in an enhanced memory that persisted up to 48h (i.e. LTM).

However, forms of plasticity that severely limit exposure, such as behavioral thermoregulation and phenological shifts, can hinder thermal adaptation.

The present study aims to clarify seasonal tracking in B. antarctica during the austral summer by monitoring oxygen consumption rates in a field population and in experimental groups exposed to shortened daylength, dehydration and chilling. Remarkably, during March, coordinated decreases in oxygen consumption are observed, ranging from 18% to 42%, in all treatment groups, indicating an anticipatory response to seasonal change regardless of the environmental cues.

The Milburn-O'Malley theory proposes that pressure development is purely physical and does not require living cells or sucrose. The osmotic theory invokes the involvement of living cells and sucrose to generate an osmotic pressure difference between fibers and vessels, which are assumed to be separated by an osmotic barrier. We analyzed wood of Acer saccharum Marsh., Juglans cinerea L. and Betula papyrifera Marsh. (all generate positive pressures) examining three critical components of the osmotic model: pits in cell walls, selectivity of the osmotic barrier and stability of air bubbles under positive xylem pressure. We examined the distribution and type of pits directly by light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and indirectly by perfusion of branch segments with fluorescent dyes with molecular masses similar to sucrose. The latter approach allowed us to use osmotic surrogates for sucrose that could be tracked by epifluorescence. Infusion experiments were used to assess the compartmentalization of sucrose and to determine the behavior of gas bubbles as predicted by Fick's and Henry's laws. The SEM images of sugar maple revealed a lack of pitting between fibers and vessels but connections between fiber-tracheids and vessels were present. Fluorescein-perfusion experiments demonstrated that large molecules do not diffuse into libriform fibers but are confined within the domain of vessels, parenchyma and fiber-tracheids. Results of the infusion experiments were in agreement with those of the fluorescein perfusions and further indicated the necessity of a compartmentalized osmolyte to drive stem pressure, as well as the inability of air bubbles to maintain such pressure because of instability. These results support the osmotic model and demonstrate that the secondary cell wall is an effective osmotic barrier for molecules larger than 300 g mol(-1).",,,,,,"Cirelli, Damian/0000-0002-2503-3189",,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,AUG,2008,28,8,,,,,1145,1155,,10.1093/treephys/28.8.1145,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/28.8.1145,,,,,,,,18519246,,,,,WOS:000258841300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Production of NO in soils is mediated by microbial nitrification and denitrification and/or chemical decomposition of microbially produced nitrite (NO2-). In monsoonal forests, soil microbial processes are exposed to strong soil moisture and temperature fluctuations, known to cause pronounced variability in NO emission. We quantified in situ fluxes of NO throughout two summers in the N-saturated TieShanPing forest, Chongqing, SW China. Additional N2O measurements were carried out in the second summer to infer likely source processes. To address spatial variability, fluxes were measured along two transects, one covering well-drained Acrisols on a forested hill slope, and the other hydrologically connected terraces with poorly drained Cambisols situated in a groundwater discharge zone. Hill slope sites emitted on average 48.4 +/- 60.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) in the relatively wet summer of 2015 and 88.4 +/- 94.6 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1) in the dry summer of 2016, illustrating the strong effect of soil moisture regime. The NO emission in the groundwater discharge zone, measured in the dry summer of 2016 only, while it was flooded in the summer of 2015, was significantly smaller (26.4 +/- 52.7 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). The mean N2O-N emission on the hillslope (18.1 +/- 13.9 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) was smaller than NO-N flux, while it was larger (38.3 +/- 39.3 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) in the groundwater discharge zone. The temporal variability of the NO flux was largely explained by soil moisture fluctuations, whereas soil organic matter pool sizes contributed most to spatial variability. Hourly measurements showed that the NO flux doubled with 8 degrees C increase of soil temperature, indicating that soil temperature was another important driver for NO emissions. Our study indicates that acid N-saturated subtropical forest soils are a large source for NO, particularly during dry summers.",,,,,"Dörsch, Peter/U-2572-2018","Dörsch, Peter/0000-0002-4916-1839",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-2563,1573-515X,,,,AUG,2017,134,3,,,,,337,351,,10.1007/s10533-017-0368-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-017-0368-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000408095700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

We describe a new outdoor mesocosm system for benthic research (benthocosms) which permit the control and manipulation of several environmental variables while admitting all natural in situ fluctuations. This is achieved by continuously measuring the relevant variables (e.g., temperature, pH, O-2, CO2) in situ, defining these in real time as reference values in the control software and simulating target climates by delta treatments. The latter constitute the manipulative addition of predefined changes (e.g., warming, acidification) to the reference values.

The competitive and facilitative interactions among incoming shrub species might influence vegetation succession and might be affected by climate change. This study aimed to identify the nature of shrub species interactions between an early colonizer and a secondary succession shrub in the successional encroachment process and whether it differs between two contrasting climatic conditions. Methods The interactions between the two main encroaching shrub species in the Central Pyrenees (Spain), Buxus sempervirens and Echinospartum horridum, were studied at the current upper limit of the altitudinal range of B. sempervirens, where it coexists with E. horridum (high site), and in a milder location at lower elevation (low site). In the studied areas, E. horridum is the first shrub species that encroaches upon the abandoned grasslands and B. sempervirens enters the system after E. horridum has become established. A neighbor-removal experiment was used to assess the bidirectional interactions between both species, and whether those interactions differed among the life stages of B. sempervirens (seedlings, juveniles and adults), at the two study sites. Survival, annual crown growth and developmental instability (error in development caused by stress) were the performance indices used to quantify plant responses. Differences in air temperatures and soil nutrient amelioration were evaluated as possible mechanisms of facilitation of E. horridum on B. sempervirens. Important Findings E. horridum enhanced the survival of B. sempervirens seedlings under its crown, whereas, B. sempervirens adults outcompeted E. horridum. Therefore, the invasion of the grasslands by E. horridum facilitated the settlement and expansion of B. sempervirens, promoting vegetation succession at the Pyrenees. In addition, climatic differences associated with elevation affected shrub interactions. Under low temperatures at the upper limit of B. sempervirens altitudinal range, the presence of E. horridum enhanced the growth of B. sempervirens juveniles. At low elevation, under a milder climate, B. sempervirens exerted a high degree of competition toward E. horridum. An increase in temperatures associated with climate change would benefit B. sempervirens juveniles growth which might affect the successional process because it would increase their competitive ability when B. sempervirens juveniles become adults.",,,,,"Alados, Concepción L/K-8085-2014","Alados, Concepción L/0000-0002-6227-861X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1752-9921,1752-993X,,,,APR,2018,11,2,,,,,297,307,,10.1093/jpe/rtx002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtx002,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000427134100014,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about quantitative relationships between transpirational demand and multiple meteorological factors, and how plants respond to short-time (day-to-day) changes in transpirational demand at the gene and molecular levels. We used a physical-based model of heat balance and transfer at a saturated surface to quantify the sensitivity of potential evaporation (Ep; a hydrometeorological indicator of transpirational demand) to each meteorological factor under a wide range of climatic conditions. Sensitivity analysis showed that Ep varies dynamically in time and space with meteorological conditions. That is, Ep changes commensurately with solar radiation Sd, somewhat increases with wind speed WS, while somewhat decreases with increasing relative humidity Rh. The sensitivity of Ep to WS and Rh increases with decreasing Sd. The logarithm of Ep decreases approximately linearly with increasing inverse absolute temperature. The validity of use of Ep as the transpirational demand under natural field conditions was confirmed by high correlation between hourly based Ep and hourly evapotranspiration in the flooded rice paddy fields. We also examined the effects of short-term changes in Ep on transpiration (ET) and transcriptomes of rice at the heading stage by altering meteorological conditions on sunny days for four hours. ET changed commensurately with Ep, and the expression levels of numerous genes, including those encoding aquaporins in rice leaves and roots, showed a significant positive or negative correlation with ET, especially in leaves. The present study suggests that rice plants may adjust their physiological condition, such as hydraulic conductivity and mesophyll conductance, through dynamic transcriptome changes in response to transpirational demand under fluctuating meteorological conditions.",,,,,"Nagano, Atsushi J./A-2957-2019","Nagano, Atsushi J./0000-0001-7891-5049; ISHIDA, Sachinobu/0000-0001-9934-2980",,,,,,,,,,,,,0098-8472,1873-7307,,,,APR,2022,196,,,,,,,,104724,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.104724,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.104724,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000760356200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such analyses indicate that climate is inherently variable over a broad range of time scales, climatic chance is geographically non-uniform in both direction and magnitude, climatic fluctuations may involve changes in frequency of extreme episodes as well as trends in mean values, and climate is shaped by a host of interacting factors.

Long-term monitoring of wet-only precipitation (NADP/NTN, 1983-2001) and dry deposition (AIRMoN, 1990-2001) at sites adjacent to the watershed showed that concentrations of SO42- in precipitation, SO42- in particles,and SO2 vapor all declined substantially (P<0.005) in contrast to no marked temporal changes observed for most N constituents (NH4+ in precipitation, HNO3 vapor, and particulate NO3-), except for NO3- in precipitation, which showed a small decrease in the late 1990s. From 1983 to 2001, concentrations of SO42- in the lake outlet significantly decreased (-2.1 mueq L-1 yr(-1), P<0.0001), whereas NO3- and dissolved organic N (DON) concentrations showed no consistent temporal trends. With the inclusion of dry deposition and DON fluxes into the mass balance, the retained portion of atmospheric N inputs within the main subcatchment increased from 37% to 60%. Sulfur outputs greatly exceeded inputs even with the inclusion of dry S deposition, while organic S flux represented another source of S output, implying substantial internal S sources. A significant relationship between the annual mean concentrations of SO42- in lake discharge and wet deposition over the last two decades (r=0.64, P<0.01) suggested a considerable influence of declining S deposition on surface water SO42- concentrations, despite substantial internal S sources. By contrast, interannual variations in both NO3- concentrations and fluxes in lake discharge were significantly related to year-to-year changes in air temperature and runoff. Snowmelt responses to winter temperature fluctuations were crucial in explaining large portions of interannual variations in watershed NO3- export during the months preceding spring snowmelt (especially, January-March). Distinctive response patterns of monthly mean concentrations of NO3- and DON in the major lake inlet to seasonal changes in air temperature also suggested climatic regulation of seasonal patterns in watershed release of both N forms. The sensitive response of N drainage losses to climatic variability might explain the synchronous patterns of decadal variations in watershed NO3- export across the northeastern USA.",,,,,"Christopher, Sheila/AAY-1333-2021; Meyers, Tilden/C-6633-2016","Christopher, Sheila/0000-0002-7200-5084; Meyers, Tilden/0000-0002-0726-4258",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,NOV,2003,9,11,,,,,1602,1619,,10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00686.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00686.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000186387400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We present two previously unpublished helicopter-borne electromagnetic (HEM) ice thickness measurements from the northwestern Barents Sea acquired in March 2003 and 2014. The HEM data are compared to ice thickness calculated from ice draft measured by ULS deployed between 1994 and 1996. These data show that ice thickness varies greatly from year to year; influenced by the thermodynamic and dynamic processes that govern local formation vs long-range advection. In a year with a large inflow of sea-ice from the Arctic Basin, the Barents Sea ice cover is dominated by thick multiyear ice; as was the case in 2003 and 1995. In a year with an ice cover that was mainly grown in situ, the ice will be thin and mechanically unstable; as was the case in 2014. The HEM data allow us to explore the spatial and temporal variability in ice thickness. In 2003 the dominant ice class was more than 2 years old; and modal sea-ice thickness varied regionally from 0.6 to 1.4 m, with the thinner ice being either first-year ice, or multiyear ice which had come into contact with warm Atlantic water. In 2014 the ice cover was predominantly locally grown ice less than 1 month old (regional modes of 0.5-0.8 m).

Spatial variability in surface meteorology was observed infrequently, and much of that was associated with atmospheric fronts and periods of low winds. Air-sea fluxes computed using the bulk formulae included spatial variability linked to the ocean, but spatial gradients in ocean surface velocities introduced a larger signal in the bulk formulae fluxes than did the gradients in sea surface temperature. The greatest differences between the observations and climatological data were seen in relative humidity and sea surface temperature.

UNDER INHIBITION,LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"Predicting tree growth processes is important due to the exceptional ecosystem role of forests, which carry out global climate regulation by sequestrating carbon, conserving drinking water, and providing habitat for living organisms. Trees are known to respond to any fluctuations in the environment. The research purpose is to identify weather and climatic factors that significantly affect the inhibition of growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in conditions of constant moisture deficit. The studies were carried out in the eastern part of the Bryansk region within the territory the Bryansk administrative district, in the educational and experimental forestry of the Bryansk State Engineering and Technological University and the Styazhnovskoye forest district. Methods of dendrochronology were used to assess the response of 93 pine trees to fluctuations in the external environment by changing the width of annual rings (available anatomical feature of a tree) using indices of radial growth. An original approach was proposed to analyze the reasons for a sharp decline in the annual radial growth under the influence of temperature and precipitation. The years with abnormally low increments (1963, 1972, 1985, 2002 and 2010) were identified against the background of the weather-climatic situation for 5 years before and after the fall in growth. Similar dynamics of absolute values of radial increments and their indices was established, which is caused by fluctuations of natural factors, manifestation of hereditary traits, etc. Significant differences were revealed between the growth rates at average multi-year values of January, May and August air temperatures with growth rates in the years of abnormally low radial growth, which are observed in pine against the background of colder January and warmer May and August of the current year, as well as under the condition of warmer January of the previous year. At the same time, no significant role of precipitation was detected. The obtained data, expanding the idea of the features of growth processes and formation of annual increments in diameter of Scots pine in the conditions of changing climate at the turn of the 20th-21st centuries, allowed us to suggest a possible manifestation of physiological features of the species, the homeostasis optimum zone of which is located in the conditions of colder boreal climate. This information expands our understanding of the features of growth processes and formation of annual increments in diameter of Scots pine in changing climatic conditions.",,,,,"Marchenko, Sergey/G-7754-2019","Marchenko, Sergey/0000-0001-5107-6839",,,,,,,,,,,,,0536-1036,,,,,,2021,,1,,,,,69,81,,10.37482/0536-1036-2021-1-69-81,http://dx.doi.org/10.37482/0536-1036-2021-1-69-81,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000623081000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Finished TMR were baled and wrapped with three layers of 750-mm wide stretch film. Fifteen bales were prepared for each treatment and three replicates at each sampling time. Another three bales for each treatment were made for temperature monitoring. After 0, 3, 7, 15, and 30 d storage, the bales were weighed and the area of the surface covered with mould was ranked. Core samples of bales were taken using a modified boring device at the same time for quality analyses. There was little temperature response over the 30 d storage period in any of the bales monitored. Visible mould spots were only appeared on the surface of baled TMR at 30 d. Decrease of DM content took place during the storage phase of baled TMR and loss of DM decreased (P<0.05) in an inverse relationship with initial DM content. Concentrations of crude protein, ether extract, and ash showed continuous increase (P<0.05; P<0.01; P<0.001) after TMR stored using baling technology. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) content exhibited a fluctuation and lignin showed increase (P<0.01; P<0.001) along with the storage time increased. The pH of baled TMR decreased (P<0.001) as stage of storage time increased. The fermentation products. e.g., ammonia nitrogen (NH(3)-N), lactic acid, acetic and propionic acid, were all showed increase (P<0.001) along with the increase of storage time, and NH(3)-N and volatile fatty acid concentrations were not very high at the end of storage. The baled TMR studied in this research were of relatively high nutritive value, had low proteolysis and no putrefactive fermentation occurred during the whole storage period of baled TMR.

The C/N ratios of the original wastes ranged from 16.8 (SMS) to 70.5 (OPC). Nine composts were prepared either from the original waste materials or from 1:1 dw/dw mixtures (GM; GM+EPC; SMS; SMS+EPC; SMS+OMW; OL; OL+EPC; OL+OMW; OL+OPC) through a composting process performed in static perimetrically insulated piles, for a period of three months. Their moisture was kept between 40-60% of their water-holding capacity and turnings were performed at the end of each thermophilic phase. The phytotoxicity of the final products was determined. The degradation of fluorescein di-acetate and the CO2-C evolution were evaluated as estimates of the microbial activity during composting of the OL+OPC mixture and were shown to be related to temperature fluctuations in the compost piles, revealing greater values of fluorescein and CO2-C release at the higher temperatures of each turn (middle of thermophilic phases) compared to the end of each thermophilic phase. However, at the end of the last thermophilic phase the total microbial biomass was significantly greater than at the middle of this phase whereas, both fluorescein release and CO2-C evolution showed extremely low values. This indicates that the labile C substrate depletion in the final product results in reduced microbial activity, but this does not necessarily indicate a small size for the microbial population colonising the final compost products. Pot experiments, set up in order to investigate the nutritional effects of the composts on the growth of maize indicator plants showed that the spent mushroom compost mixtures resulted in the best plant growth, followed by the grape mark waste material, whereas the composts based solely on olive extraction by-products performed poorly.

Studies that examine effects on embryos rarely assess the potential for thermal tolerance to change with ontogeny or how effects differ among sympatric species, and often utilize unrealistic temperature treatments. We used thermal fluctuations from nests within the urbanheat island to determine how thermal tolerance of embryos changes across development and differs among two sympatric lizard species (Antis sagrei and Antis cristatefius). We applied fluctuations that varied in frequency and magnitude at different times during development and measured effects on embryo physiology and survival, and hatchling morphology, growth and survival. Thermal tolerance differed between the species by similar to 2 degrees C: embryos of A. sagrei, a lizard that prefers warmer, open-canopy microhabitats, were more robust to thermal stress than embryos of A. cristatellus, which prefers cooler, closed-canopy microhabitats. Moreover, thermal tolerance changed through development; however, the nature of this change differed between the species. For A. cristatellus, thermal tolerance was greatest mid-development. For A. sagrei, the relationship was not statistically clear. The greatest effects of thermal stress were on embryo and hatchling survival and embryo physiology. Hatchling morphology and growth were less affected. Inter-specific responses and the timing of stochastic thermal events with respect to development have important effects on embryo mortality. Thus, research that integrates ecologically meaningful thermal treatments, considers multiple life-history stages and examines interspecific responses will be critical to make robust predictions of the impacts of global change on wildlife.",,,,,"Hall, Joshua/AAP-7302-2020","Hall, Joshua/0000-0002-5587-3402; Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,OCT,2019,222,19,,,,,,,jeb210708,10.1242/jeb.210708,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.210708,,,,,,,,31527177,,,,,WOS:000490244400019,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is unclear whether a decline in groundwater level exerts a negative effect on the seed survival of wet-meadow plant species in the soil. This paper assessed the dependence of soil seed survival on different groundwater levels. We tested the influence of the groundwater level on the seed survival rate of 8 wet-meadow plant species in fen lysimeters with constant groundwater levels of 5, 30 and 70 cm. Seeds were buried in nylon mesh bags at 2 depths (5 and 25 cm), exhumed after 1, 3 and 5 years in the spring and tested in a climate chamber for germinable seeds under conditions of different day-night rhythms and fluctuating temperatures. At both burial depths, more viable seeds survived at lower groundwater levels compared with groundwater levels near the surface. Waterlogged conditions resulted in a significant reduction in the number of germinable seeds for most of the studied plant species. A cluster analysis divided the eight plant species into three groups which differed in soil seed bank persistence and tolerance towards soil wetness. The decline of the groundwater level due to fen-meadow drainage does not negatively affect the seeds of wet-meadow plant species. Our results also suggest that for some species, the classification of soil seed bank type may vary according to the groundwater level dynamic of the location.",,,,,,"Pirhofer Walzl, Karin/0000-0003-2185-4016",,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,1573-5036,,,,FEB,2015,387,1-2,,,,,219,231,,10.1007/s11104-014-2273-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2273-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000348318100016,View Full Record in Web of Science

We characterize the stochasticity of SGD and a recently-introduced variant, persistent SGD, in a prototypical neural network model. In the under-parametrized regime, where the final training error is positive, the SGD dynamics reaches a stationary state and we define an effective temperature from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, computed from dynamical mean-field theory. We use the effective temperature to quantify the magnitude of the SGD noise as a function of the problem parameters. In the over-parametrized regime, where the training error vanishes, we measure the noise magnitude of SGD by computing the average distance between two replicas of the system with the same initialization and two different realizations of SGD noise.

In the fluctuating across-shelf momentum budget, the dominant terms are surface wind stress, pressure gradient, and Coriolis acceleration. The balance is a combination of (1) the geostrophic balance expected at midshelf sites and (2) the coastal setup and setdown balance driven by the across-shelf wind stress expected where surface and bottom boundary layers overlap. At the 12 m site, the estimated wave radiation stress gradient due to surface gravity wave shoaling is also large but is uncorrelated with the observed pressure gradient. A simple model suggests the wave radiation stress gradient is balanced by an across-shelf pressure gradient with a spatial scale too small to resolve with this mooring array. In the fluctuating along-shelf momentum balance, the dominant terms are surface wind stress, pressure gradient, and bottom stress at the shallower site, but the other estimated terms are not negligible. Our results support the Grant and Madsen (1986) formulation for wave-induced bottom stress. The fluctuating along-shelf pressure gradient is mainly a local sea level response to wind forcing, not a remotely generated pressure gradient. A strong correlation between along-shelf velocity and along-shelf wind stress at the shallower site is captured by a simple steady model of imbalance between wind stress and pressure gradient balanced by linear bottom drag.",,,,,"Fewings, Melanie/F-6838-2013","Fewings, Melanie/0000-0003-2903-1620; Lentz, Steven/0000-0001-7498-0281",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,DEC 9,2010,115,,,,,,,,C12023,10.1029/2009JC005578,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JC005578,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000285259800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For FTC, lipids were the most accumulated energy source, whereas during freezing (-4 A degrees C), proteins were the most used. FTC caused the highest Ec, indicating the higher energy requirements for organisms when shifting between freezing and thawing events.

This variability is a component of personality and arises even when genetics and environment are held constant. Discovering the biological mechanisms underlying behavioral variability depends on efficiently measuring individual behavioral bias, a requirement that is facilitated by automated, high-throughput experiments. We compiled a large data set of individual locomotor behavior measures, acquired from over 183,000 fruit flies walking in Y-shaped mazes. With this data set we first conducted a computational ethology natural history study to quantify the distribution of individual behavioral biases with unprecedented precision and examine correlations between behavioral measures with high power. We discovered a slight, but highly significant, left-bias in spontaneous locomotor decision-making. We then used the data to evaluate standing hypotheses about biological mechanisms affecting behavioral variability, specifically: the neuromodulator serotonin and its precursor transporter, heterogametic sex, and temperature. We found a variety of significant effects associated with each of these mechanisms that were behavior-dependent. This indicates that the relationship between biological mechanisms and behavioral variability may be highly context dependent. Going forward, automation of behavioral experiments will likely be essential in teasing out the complex causality of individuality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1662-5153,,,,,MAY 26,2022,16,,,,,,,,836626,10.3389/fnbeh.2022.836626,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2022.836626,,,,,,,,35692381,,,,,WOS:000808249600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the comparison across studies, accidental mortality ranged from 10% to 93%. Mortality was lower in studies conducted in locations and at times of year with warmer average temperatures. We found no differences in mortality among bait and trap types across these 16 studies. In our intrastudy analysis from Algonquin Park, Sorex spp. experienced high mortality (81%) regardless of environmental conditions. In contrast, northern short-tailed shrews had low overall mortality (13%), but mortality increased on rainy nights and on colder nights when overnight temperatures dropped below 10 degrees C. Comparisons between 2 trapping protocols within Algonquin Park suggested that both Blarina brevicauda and Sorex sp. experienced higher mortality in Sherman compared with Longworth traps, but these effects were confounded by other differences in methodology between studies. Although we found evidence consistent with some shrew mortality being caused by caloric constraints, experimental studies on bait supplements are necessary to test whether providing high-calorie baits is an efficient method to reduce the widespread shrew mortality that occurs in small-mammal livetrapping studies.",,,,,"Shonfield, Julia/O-4216-2019; McAdam, Andrew G/G-1802-2010","Shonfield, Julia/0000-0002-7159-4016; McAdam, Andrew G/0000-0001-7323-2572",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2372,1545-1542,,,,AUG,2013,94,4,,,,,745,753,,10.1644/12-MAMM-A-271.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1644/12-MAMM-A-271.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000323532600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We explored the relationships between immunological and oxidative status and investigated how birds cope physiologically with the effects of immune-derived oxidative damage. We successively implemented two experimental manipulations to alter physiological status in a model bird species: the homing pigeon (Columba livia). The first manipulation, an immune supplementation, was achieved by oral administration of lysozyme, a naturally occurring and non-specific antimicrobial enzyme. The second manipulation, an immune challenge, took the form of an injection with lipopolysaccharide, a bacterial endotoxin. Between groups of lysozyme-treated and control birds, we compared lipopolysaccharide-induced changes in reactive oxygen metabolites, total antioxidant capacity, haptoglobin, oxygen consumption, body mass and cloacal temperature. Lysozyme supplementation intensified the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response and generated short-term oxidative and metabolic costs. We identified significant interactions between immune supplementation and immune challenge in terms of reactive oxygen metabolites, haptoglobin and oxygen consumption. Our study provides alternative interpretations of differences in oxidative and immunological indices and demonstrates that these indices can also fluctuate and interact across very short time scales, reflecting something akin to current 'health status' or 'physiological condition'.

The intertidal limpet Patella rustica Linnaeus, 1758, is a warm-water species whose changes in distribution have been related to the recent warming off northern Portugal. Here we analyse the effects of the severe winter of 2008/2009 on the demographic structure of P. rustica, with the objectives of reassessing its geographical distribution and testing the mechanisms underlying the establishment of range limits. In addition, three decades of sea surface temperature were analysed, providing information on the thermal context contemporaneous to the distributional changes. Despite the cold winter of 2008/2009, the abundance of P. rustica increased in the study area, showing that the previously reported changes on the distribution of this species were not ephemeral. The demographic analyses suggested that even though early life stages are probably affected by extreme low winter temperatures, adults are less sensitive, with important consequences for the resilience of marginal populations and the fluctuations of distributional ranges. These results emphasise the importance of considering the demographic consequences of thermal stress when trying to understand and forecast the effects of climate change on biogeography and biodiversity.

The wood was responsible for only 15% of the shrinkage associated with a freeze event, and experiments with isolated bark showed that connection with the wood was not necessary for most of the freeze-induced shrinkage to occur. Considering the amount of stem shrinkage associated with summer drought in walnut, the amount of contraction of the bark with freezing was actually much less than might be predicted by water relations theory. Reversible stem shrinkage occurred in living tissues, but not in autoclaved tissues. For the latter, swelling was observed with freezing and this swelling could be explained by the bark alone. Similar swelling was observed during September and October for non-acclimated plants. Water was lost with each freeze-thaw cycle starting with the first, and freezing injury of the bark, with discoloration of tissues, was also observed in non-acclimated plants.

They contribute to the fact that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem does not apply in living systems. In this work we probe the cytoskeletal out-of-equilibrium dynamics by performing simultaneous active and passive microrheology experiments, using the same micron-sized probe specifically bound to the actin cortex. The free motion of the probe exhibits a constrained, subdiffusive behavior at short time scales (t < 2s), and a directed, superdiffusive behavior at larger time scales, while, in response to a step force, its creep function presents the usual weak power law dependence with time. Combining the results of both experiments, we precisely measure for the first time the power spectrum of the force fluctuations exerted on this probe, which lies more than one order of magnitude above the spectrum expected at equilibrium, and greatly depends on frequency. We retrieve an effective temperature T-eff of the system, as an estimate of the departure from thermal equilibrium. This departure is especially pronounced for long time scales, where T-eff bears the footprint of the cooperative activity of motors pulling on the actin network.

Periphyton chl-a densities and plant decline were significantly related to nutrient loading in all countries. Fish effects were significant in a few sites only, mostly because of their contribution to the nutrient pool. A saturation-response type curve in periphyton chl-a with nutrients was found, and northern lakes achieved higher densities than southern lakes. Nutrient concentration and phytoplankton chl-a necessary for a 50% plant reduction followed a latitudinal gradient. Total phosphorus values for 50% plant disappearance were similar from Sweden (0.27 mg L-1) to northern Spain (0.35 mg L-1), but with a sharp increase in southern Spain (0.9 mg L-1). Planktonic chl-a values for 50% plant reduction increased monotonically from Sweden (30 mu g L-1s) to Valencia (150 mu g L-1). Longer plant growing-season, higher light intensities and temperature, and strong water-level fluctuations characteristic of southern latitudes can lead to greater persistence of macrophyte biomass at higher turbidities and nutrient concentration than in northern lakes.

In field experiments, we tested algal tolerance to aerial exposure in 3 assemblages: green filamentous and cyanobacterial assemblages in Thailand and a mixed (filamentous green + cyanobacteria) assemblage in New Zealand. Algae-bearing stones were exposed at night, during the day (in sun or shade, with or without simulated rain), or continuously, or were continuously submerged (with a handling control). Exposure reduced cyanobacterial chlorophyll a, and reduction was greater with day than with night exposure. Mixed algal assemblages showed a similar pattern in chlorophyll a, but ash-free dry mass (AFDM) did not change (bleached algae remained). In contrast, green filamentous algae survived better when exposed than when submerged, and when exposed during the day than at night. Snails consumed green filamentous algae, and submersion resulted in high grazing loss of filamentous algae but not cyanobacteria. Grazing pressure was presumably lower at night during water release. For cyanobacteria, shade and rain slightly increased chlorophyll a retention. For filamentous green algae, shade had no effect, and rain was beneficial in the shade but not the sun. Our experiments demonstrated an interaction among variable hydraulic conditions, activity of grazing snails, and availability of grazing-susceptible algae.

This study estimated annual fluxes of CH4 and N2O, and ecosystem respiration (R-eco), from eight organic soils managed by agriculture. The sites were located in three regions representing different landscape types and climatic conditions, and three land use categories were covered (arable crops, AR, grass in rotation, RG, and permanent grass, PG). The normal management at each site was followed, except that no N inputs occurred during the monitoring period from August 2008 to October 2009. The stratified sampling strategy further included six sampling points in three blocks at each site. Environmental variables (precipitation, PAR, air and soil temperature, soil moisture, groundwater level) were monitored continuously and during sampling campaigns, where also groundwater samples were taken for analysis. Gaseous fluxes were monitored on a three-weekly basis, giving 51, 49 and 38 field campaigns for land use categories AR, PG and RG, respectively. Climatic conditions in each region during monitoring were representative as compared to 20-yr averages. Peat layers were shallow, typically 0.5 to 1 m, and with a pH of 4 to 5. At six sites annual emissions of N2O were in the range 3 to 24 kg N2O-N ha(-1), but at two arable sites (spring barley, potato) net emissions of 38 and 61 kg N2O-N ha(-1) were recorded. The two high-emitting sites were characterized by fluctuating groundwater, low soil pH and elevated groundwater SO42- concentrations. Annual fluxes of CH4 were generally small, as expected, ranging from 2 to 4 kg CH4 ha(-1). However, two permanent grasslands had tussocks of Juncus effusus L. (soft rush) in sampling points that were consistent sources of CH4 throughout the year. Emission factors for organic soils in rotation and with permanent grass, respectively, were estimated to be 0.011 and 0.47 gm(-2) for CH4, and 2.5 and 0.5 gm(-2) for N2O. This first documentation of CH4 and N2O emissions from managed organic soils in Denmark confirms the levels and wide ranges of emissions previously reported for the Nordic countries. However, the stratified experimental design also identified links between gaseous emissions and site-specific conditions with respect to soil, groundwater and vegetation which point to areas of future research that may account for part of the variability and hence lead to improved emission factors or models.",,,,,"Larsen, Søren E./J-6754-2013; Elsgaard, Lars/A-7698-2013; Hoffmann, Carl Christian/B-6714-2011; Petersen, Soren O./E-9714-2016; Hoffmann, Carl Christian/AAD-5078-2020","Larsen, Søren E./0000-0003-4570-9489; Elsgaard, Lars/0000-0003-0058-7609; Hoffmann, Carl Christian/0000-0002-1268-9162; Hoffmann, Carl Christian/0000-0002-1268-9162; Larsen, Soren Erik/0000-0001-8428-2065",,,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2012,9,1,,,,,403,422,,10.5194/bg-9-403-2012,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-9-403-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000300229000028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over the northern California shelf the bottom mixed-layer height is shown to depend on the stratification, the current magnitude, and the current direction. The dependence on current direction tends to dominate the response, with thicker bottom mixed layers during poleward flows and thinner bottom mixed layers during equatorward flows.

The adaptation of T. nativa to a cold climate is reflected by the well-documented freeze tolerance of its muscle larvae. The ability of the larvae to survive repeated freezing and thawing events has not however been elucidated and was investigated in the present study, using an Alaskan isolate and two isolates from coastal and inland Norway, respectively. Each T. nativa isolate was inoculated in foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and the muscle tissue obtained after 20 weeks was minced and divided into freezer bags. In the initial part of the study, the bags were exposed to either continuous freezing (-5 degrees C) for up to 7 weeks or freezing (-5 degrees C) for up to 7 weeks with seven overnight (+21 degrees C) thawing events. Once a week a bag was removed from each group, the meat was digested and muscle larvae isolated. In vitro assessment of larval viability was carried out based on larval motility (active vs non-active) and morphology, coiled (alive) or C-shaped (dead). Larval infectivity was subsequently bioassayed in mice, administering 500 larvae per mouse. The mice were euthanised 4 weeks post inoculation, the muscle digested and larvae per gram (lpg) and reproductive capacity index (RCI) were calculated. During the second part of the study, some of the minced fox muscle, exposed to the initial freeze protocol, was stored for a further 23 weeks at -18 degrees C prior to in vitro and in vivo assessment of larval viability and infectivity. The study demonstrated that Trichinella isolates originating from carnivores from higher northern latitudes expressed highest tolerance to freezing and that temperature fluctuations around freezing point, for up to 7 weeks, had little effect on larval infectivity. A negative effect of the initial repeated freeze-thaw events could be demonstrated once the larvae were exposed to longer periods of subsequent deep freezing. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that larval morphology and motility are not suitable for the assessment of infectivity of Trichinella larvae. It was concluded that bioassay in mice was the only suitable method currently available for assessing larval viability.",,,,,"Kapel, Christian M. O./G-9168-2014","Kapel, Christian M.

Linear approximations were shown to be effective for the description of second turbulent moments in this sublayer. These approximations correspond to truncated Taylor expansions with respect to inverse dimensionless height, in which only two terms are retained. The first terms in the expansion do not take wind into account and correspond to the limiting relationships of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory in the regime of free convection. The second terms of the expansion take into account wind and its effect on convection. The existence of the sublayer of forced convection with a fixed boundary leads to the construction of a one-parameter family of analytical approximations of turbulent moments depending on the elevation of the bottom boundary of this sublayer. The proposed approximations of the variances of vertical velocity, fluctuations of temperature, fluctuations of humidity, and fluctuations of carbon dioxide are compared with the available experimental data over both water surface and land surface.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0097-8078,1608-344X,,,,APR,2022,49,2,,,,,223,230,,10.1134/S0097807822020142,http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807822020142,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000773989000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experimental implementation using diffractive optics has provided unprecedented sensitivity for the study of protein motions by enabling the passive phase locking of the four beams that constitute the experiment, and an unambiguous separation of the Real and Imaginary parts of the signal. Ligand photodissociation of carboxymyoglobin (MbCO) induces a sequence of events involving the relaxation of the protein structure to accommodate ligand escape. These motions show up in the Real part: of the signal. The ligand (CO) transport process involves an initial, small amplitude, change in volume, reflecting the transit time of the ligand through the protein, followed by a significantly larger volume change with ligand escape to the surrounding water. The latter process is well described by a single exponential process of 725 +/- 15 ns at room temperature. The overall dynamics provide a distinctive signature that can be understood in the context of segmental protein fluctuations that aid ligand escape via a few specific cavities, and they suggest the existence of discrete escape pathways.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,MAY 22,2001,98,11,,,,,6110,6115,,10.1073/pnas.101130298,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.101130298,,,,,,,,11344263,,,,,WOS:000168883700033,View Full Record in Web of Science

It appears, for the entire tropics, the observed outgoing radiation fluxes increase with the increase in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The observed behavior of radiation fluxes implies negative feedback processes associated with relatively low climate sensitivity. This is the opposite of the behavior of 11 atmospheric models forced by the same SSTs. Therefore, the models display much higher climate sensitivity than is inferred from ERBE, though it is difficult to pin down such high sensitivities with any precision. Results also show, the feedback in ERBE is mostly from shortwave radiation while the feedback in the models is mostly from longwave radiation. Although such a test does not distinguish the mechanisms, this is important since the inconsistency of climate feedbacks constitutes a very fundamental problem in climate prediction.

Flowering time is tightly controlled by complex genetic networks that integrate endogenous and exogenous cues, such as light, temperature, photoperiod, and hormones. Here, we show that AGAMOUS-LIKE16 (AGL16) and its negative regulator microRNA824 (miR824) control flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. Knockout of AGL16 effectively accelerates flowering in nonvernalized Col-FRI, in which the floral inhibitor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) is strongly expressed, but shows no effect if plants are vernalized or grown in short days. Alteration of AGL16 expression levels by manipulating miR824 abundance influences the timing of flowering quantitatively, depending on the expression level and number of functional FLC alleles. The effect of AGL16 is fully dependent on the presence of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). Further experiments show that AGL16 can interact directly with SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE and indirectly with FLC, two proteins that form a complex to repress expression of FT.

In order to disentangle the effects of predation by juvenile fish, algal resource availability and their interactive effects on zooplankton population dynamics, we conducted an enclosure experiment where zooplankton were exposed to a gradient of predation of roach (Rutilus rutilus) at different algal concentrations. We show that zooplankton populations collapse under high predation pressure irrespective of resource availability, confirming that juvenile fish are able to severely reduce zooplankton prey when occurring in high densities. At lower predation pressure, however, the effect of predation depended on algal resource availability since high algal resource supply buffered against predation. Hence, we suggest that interactions between mass-hatching of fish, and the strong fluctuations in algal resources in spring have the potential to regulate zooplankton population dynamics.

However, wide fluctuations in germination percentage, observed both in naturally overwintered oospores, and under controlled conditions, indicate an important role for endogenous factors in the germination frequency. Ad hoc experimental assays and microscopic observations highlight an important role for calcium in the germination process. However, for a profound understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying oospore germination, mathematical models of the germination dynamics are needed.

Globally, temperatures are expected to increase, but changes in precipitation will be variable with some locations expected to receive more and other locations to receive less. The amount and timing of precipitation has a strong influence on wetland hydroperiod, which is a critical factor in determining wetland use by species of pond-breeding amphibians. Past research has focused on the direct effects of reductions in precipitation and shorter hydroperiods, such as larvae desiccation, but little attention has been given to the indirect consequences of increased precipitation and longer hydroperiods, such as changes in predation pressure. We used wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), a species that typically breeds in ephemeral (temporary) wetlands, to test the hypothesis that increased precipitation and permanent wetlands would indirectly increase mortality in wood frog embryos through increases in the density of embryo predators, second-year green frog larvae (Lithobates clamitans), limnephilid and phryganeid caddisfly larvae and red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens). We conducted translocation experiments in 2014 and 2015. We monitored wood frog embryo hatch success and mortality from predation using open (predator access) and closed (predators excluded) cages in 16 wetlands in each year. We observed no difference in embryo hatch success between ephemeral and permanent wetlands, with water temperature, not pH, affecting hatch rates. Wood frog embryos in permanent wetlands with overwintered second-year green frog larvae had higher mortality from predation (0.80, 95% confidence intervals 0.65-0.91) than permanent wetlands (0.42, CI 0.26-0.60) and ephemeral wetlands (0.37, CI 0.31-0.45) that lacked predatory green frog larvae. Embryo mortality from predation increased with increasing green frog larvaedensity. Regression models showed that ponds with larvae densities >2.5 larvae m(-2) resulted in 90% embryo mortality. Caddisfly larvae and red-spotted newt density had no effect, and pond water temperature had a weak negative effect on embryo mortality from predation. Under a wetter and warmer climate, springtime occupancy of predatory green frog larvae is likely to increase, resulting in a reduction in the amount of suitable wood frog breeding habitat. Our research suggests that indirect effects of climate change mediated through biotic interactions may play a critical role in the distribution of ephemeral wetland species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,JUL,2017,62,7,,,,,1244,1254,,10.1111/fwb.12941,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12941,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000403021500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Examination of the optimized control variables (coupling parameters) and the resultant climate fields reveals that the model errors in the North Atlantic climate variations are very sensitive to the intensity of the extratropical air-sea thermal coupling. This results in the enhancement of the atmospheric responses to SST changes particularly around 40 degrees N, 50 degrees W, when the model errors are most effectively corrected.

When applied to living organisms, it measures the heat released due to the energy transformations associated with metabolism under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. This is in contrast to the often-used respirometric techniques for assessing energy turnover, which can only be used under fully aerobic conditions. Accordingly, calorimetry is considered the 'gold standard' for quantifying metabolic rate, yet despite this, it remains a seldom-used technique among comparative physiologists. The reasons for this are related to the expense and perceived difficulty of the technique. We have designed and constructed an inexpensive flow-through calorespirometer capable of detecting rates of metabolic heat loss and oxygen consumption ((M) over dot(O2)) in fish under a variety of environmental conditions over long-term experiments. The metabolic heat of the fish is detected as a voltage by a collection of Peltier units wired in series, while oxygen optodes placed on the inflowing and outflowing water lines are used for the calculation of (M) over dot(O2).

As flames move through spatially heterogeneous environments, sudden shifts in temperature, wind, or topography can generate combustion instabilities, or trigger self-stabilizing feedback loops, that dramatically amplify the intensities and rates with which fires propagate. Such transitions are rarely captured by predictive models of fire behavior and, thus, complicate efforts in fire suppression. This paper describes a simple, remarkably instructive physical model for examining the eruption of small flames into intense, rapidly moving flames stabilized by feedback between wind and fire (i.e., wind-fire coupling-a mechanism of feedback particularly relevant to forest fires), and it presents evidence that characteristic patterns in the dynamics of spreading flames indicate when such transitions are likely to occur. In this model system, flames propagate along strips of nitrocellulose with one of two possible modes of propagation: a slow, structured mode, and a fast, unstructured mode sustained by wind-fire coupling. Experimental examination of patterns in dynamics that emerge near bifurcation points suggests that symptoms of critical slowing down (i.e., the slowed recovery of the system from perturbations as it approaches tipping points) warn of impending transitions to the unstructured mode. Findings suggest that slowing responses of spreading flames to sudden changes in environment (e.g., wind, terrain, temperature) may anticipate the onset of intense, feedback-stabilized modes of propagation (e.g., blowup fires in forests).",,,,,,"FOX, JEROME/0000-0002-3739-1899",,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,FEB 24,2015,112,8,,,,,2378,2383,,10.1073/pnas.1417043112,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1417043112,,,,,,,,25675491,,,,,WOS:000349911700036,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent declines in settlement in lobster populations around the world have been associated with changing ocean climate impacts on the accumulation and use of energy reserves during this phase of the lifecycle. Here, we experimentally measured the energy requirements of swimming postlarvae of the Australasian red spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii (Hutton, 1875). Wild-caught postlarvae actively swimming in tanks were found to have high energy demands, on average catabolizing 1.6 (SE 0.2) mg of lipid d(-1), which is consistent with previous estimates for pueruli of this species using indirect estimations. In contrast, the protein reserves of experimentally swum pueruli only began to be used following the depletion of lipid reserves. A large observed difference in the nutritional condition of pueruli arriving at the sampling site between years is likely to translate into marked interannual differences in the survival and recruitment of pueruli into the population. To begin to understand the dramatic interannual fluctuations in the recruitment of spiny lobsters, it is necessary to determine the environmental factors leading to differences in nutritional condition of their pueruli. Differences in water temperature and zooplankton food availability that impact the ability of lobster larvae to accumulate nutrients appear to be likely candidates for closer examination in future studies.",,,,,"Jeffs, Andrew G/D-9474-2012","Jeffs, Andrew/0000-0002-8504-1949",,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-4977,1553-6955,,,,JUL,2018,94,3,,,,,821,833,,10.5343/bms.2017.1116,http://dx.doi.org/10.5343/bms.2017.1116,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000447254900019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Variations in upwelling are related to changes in the strength and depth of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) caused by wind-forcing at different timescales. Seasonally, the strongest upwelling at Jarvis occurs in boreal spring when a weakening of the trade winds in the eastern and central Pacific coincides with a locally shallow thermocline and shallow and strong EUC. Year to year differences in springtime upwelling are associated with the strength of the trade winds in the western Pacific; intensified trade winds associated with La Nina conditions favor the shoaling of the thermocline and the EUC at Jarvis. On intraseasonal timescales, upwelling events at Jarvis are linked to local trade wind bursts, which cause a regional upwelling that also enhances EUC-driven upwelling. Strong (>1.00 m s(-1)) near-surface eastward currents measured at Jarvis, associated with trade wind relaxations in the central Pacific, are downwelling favorable. During periods of EUC-driven upwelling, interactions of the semidiurnal tide with Jarvis result in abrupt cold spikes (1-4 degrees C) that tend to occur at similar to 12 hour period. Tidal currents and temperature fluctuate 180 degrees out of phase, such that minimum temperatures coincide with maximum eastward current. The high-frequency upwelling appears to be most consistent with the presence of internal tides.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,DEC 14,2006,111,C12,,,,,,,C12011,10.1029/2005JC003161,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005JC003161,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000242944200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An innovative alternative to pumping methods with the purpose to reduce water volumes, is the establishment of deep rooted, high water-use vegetation covers to act as artificial pumps. Hydraulic control is one of the leading applications of plant-based strategies for remediating and managing groundwater systems by introducing plantations in selected areas with high ingress potential. This study investigates the impact of plantation introduction on the reduction of effective groundwater recharge. A temperature-based field model was formulated to determine daily ET from measured and observed leaf and air temperature. Results were compared to the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organisation) Penman-Monteith reference crop ET (Evapotranspiration) model and the Shuttleworth-Wallace models in order to validate the predictions of the field model. The developed field model was then used to predict monthly ET values for the Cooke 4 study area (Gemsbokfontein West compartment) to determine the possible reduction of pumping volumes.

Although similar to natural hard bottom environments such as coral reefs or offshore banks, jetties in temperate or subtropical areas are subjected to substantially more environmental instability including swift channelized currents, terrestrial runoff, maintenance dredging, fluctuating temperatures, and swells from ship and recreational boat traffic. The gorgonian coral Leptogorgia virgulata, found on south Texas jetties, is constantly exposed to the variable salinity and sediment loads associated with these jetty systems. In this study, L virgulata was collected from the Aransas Pass jetties near Corpus Christi, Texas and experimentally tested to determine their ability to tolerate a range of salinities and sediment loads over 14 days. In response to salinity, L virgulata showed significant tissue loss (p<0.05) at 10, 15, 45, 50 and 60 with 100% loss at 60, but showed little or no tissue loss and peak polyp activity at 25-40. When exposed to sedimentation treatments up to 20,000 mg l(-1), L virgulata maintained healthy tissue and polyp feeding activity and did not show any symptoms or significant differences in tissue loss. These results indicate that L. virgulata is well-adapted to euryhaline conditions and is very tolerant of high sediment loads, a factor in its success on structures along the Texas coast.

Common Carp Cyprinus carpio is a widespread invasive species that can exert negative density-dependent effects on aquatic food webs. However, little is known concerning processes that regulate their recruitment. We used summer-through-fall electrofishing catch rates of age-0 Common Carp to investigate the importance of biotic (stock size, prey availability, egg and juvenile predation, intraspecific competition) and abiotic (water level fluctuation, temperature, wind events) factors on recruitment and growth in 13 lakes across eastern South Dakota from 2008 to 2010. Mean relative abundance of age-0 Common Carp was highly variable spatially and temporally, ranging from 0 to 152.2 fish per hour of electrofishing. Ricker stockrecruitment models indicated that peak production of age-0 Common Carp occurred when adult Common Carp relative abundance was low. Recruitment also increased with springsummer temperatures, decreased with wind events, and was affected by annual water level fluctuations. Age-0 Common Carp growth, estimated by mean size in August, was highly variable (mean TL = 42165mm) and influenced by the abundance of conspecifics and wind events, indicating that density-dependent interactions may have occurred during early life stages. Combined, our results suggest that the early life history of Common Carp is regulated by density-dependent processes and abiotic environmental conditions, which provide new insights into mechanisms regulating recruitment of this widespread invasive species.

The present study describes temporal patterns of D. vexillum percent cover on experimental substrates over 1.5-years in relation to seasonality of substratum availability, in conjunction with key physical (ie. temperature and sedimentation) and biological factors (i.e. interspecific competition) at two sites in New Zealand. Colonies showed large fluctuations in percent cover between the two study sites and with reference to timing of bare substratum availability. Colonies generally exhibited an initial lag phase, with peak levels of D. vexillum cover reached during the second summer or autumn post-deployment. The long-term competitive dominance of colonies founded from the reattachment of fragments, as opposed to ambient larval recruitment alone, was also investigated. Increases in colony size as a result of ambient recruitment alone were initially much slower. However, after 12-months colony cover exceeded that of plates inoculated with fragments, suggesting the benefit of the apparent competitive dominance conferred by fragment inoculation is restricted to the early establishment phase.

The impact of Hurricane Andrew, a severe Category 4 hurricane, on the tropical tree Lysiloma latisiliquum was examined in three south Florida subtropical forests along a gradient of hurricane disturbance (high, moderate, none). The population closest to the northern eye wall of the hurricane had the highest mortality and most severe structural damage while the population near the southern eye wall of the hurricane experienced less mortality and damage. Posthurricane reproduction was least in the disturbed sites while the undisturbed site had extensive reproduction in both 1993 and 1994. Average seed production was low due to seed predation by a bruchid beetle but some populations experienced spatial and temporal escape from this seed predator. Germination from a dormant seed bank occurred only at the most severely disturbed site in 1992. Seed germination was associated with both tip-up pits and high understory light levels. in experimental trials, fluctuating heat treatments for 5 days increased seed germination. Severe hurricane disturbance is believed to have triggered germination from a dormant seed bank through strong diurnal soil temperature fluctuations resulting from extensive canopy removal. In south Florida, the temporal and spatial dynamics of both hurricane and fire disturbance are predicted jointly to influence the population dynamics of this canopy tree species.

Here, we experimentally tested in a northern boreal forest how three various types of snow cover changes 1) ice encasement, 2) the absence of snow, and 3) snow compaction influence wintertime soil gas concentrations, growing season microbial respiration and biomass, extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (N). The consequences varied drastically among experimental treatments. An initially strong increase in wintertime soil CO2 accumulation in response to ice encasement weakened during the course of the 3-year experiment, when at the same time, growing season phenol oxidase decreased by 13% and beta-glucosidase activity increased by 25%. The absence of snow enhanced beta-glucosidase activity by 47% and, by the third year of experiment, increased inorganic soil N concentration. Snow compaction, in turn, enhanced phenol oxidase activity by 27% together with soil microbial respiration and biomass carbon.

However, limited resources of mineral fertilizers and their high cost necessitate research to identify the most effective options for their application. Our purpose was to optimize the nutrition system of winter triticale crops by determining the best options for the pre-sowing application of polynutrient fertilizers, establishing the effectiveness of different variants of additional fertilization that ensure the highest grain yield of winter triticale in years with various temperature and precipitation during the growing period. The study was conducted using the conventional technique in the Private Agricultural Enterprise Imeni Shevchenka (Kharkivska Oblast. Velykoburlutskyi Raion) in 2018-2020. The two-factor experiment was performed in segregated plots arranged in two bands in four replications. The plot area was 150 m(2); the recording area was 100 m(2). Various temperatures and significant fluctuations in the precipitation amount and its distribution during the spring-summer vegetation of winter triticale greatly influenced the growth processes in plants, which significantly affected the grain yield. Simultaneously, this made it possible to more fully determine the impact of the studied nutrition variants on the grain yield of this crop. In general, the highest grain yield of winter triticale in 2018, 2019, and 2020 (5.67 t/ha, 6.67 t/ha, and 5.72 t/ha, respectively) was achieved where the nutrition algorithm included the pre-sowing application of compound fertilizer, ammophos, at a dose of N12P52, root application of ammonium nitrate at a dose of N-50 at the beginning of the tillering phase (microphase 22) and two foliar treatments - at the beginning of stem elongation (microphase 31) and in the flag-leaf ligule phase (microphase 39) with the following mixture: urea (N-5.4), magnesium sulfate (1.0 kg/ha) and water-soluble compound fertilizer FerCristal SUMMUM (1.5 kg/ha). The third foliar application in the early milky ripeness phase (microphase 73) with the same fertilizer mixture did not significantly increase the grain yield. The proposed fertilization algorithm of winter triticale is of great ecological importance, as the rejection of fertilization on frozen-thawed soil lessens nitrogen outflow attributed to a possible runoff on the soil surface during thawings, and the replacement of compound fertilizer ammonium nitrate phosphate fertilizer with ammophos, due to reduction in the nitrogen dose, decreased the risk of nitrate migration into groundwater, while improving the phosphorus nutrition of plants with half the dose of fertilizer.",,,,,"Tetiana, Romanova/AAL-6486-2021; Stankevych, Serhii/U-8532-2019; Viktorivna, Gepenko Olexandra/AAC-2628-2022; Matsyura, A.

Ammonia is an atmospheric pollutant and responsible for eutrophication and soil acidification, while CO2, CH4, and N2O are greenhouse gases (GHG) that contribute to global warming. The quantification of gaseous emissions from livestock buildings with natural ventilation systems is a particularly difficult task and is associated with uncertainties that are largely unknown. One key issue is to measure the ventilation rate and then to quantify the gaseous emissions. Therefore, in this study, the ventilation rate was determined by three different methods simultaneously. Field experiments were carried out to study the ventilation rate in a naturally ventilated dairy barn located in northern Germany during the summer seasons from 2006 to 2010. The air exchange rates (AER) as well as the ventilation rates were determined by the decay of the radioactive tracer krypton-85, the carbon dioxide (CO2) balance, which was used as the reference method in this study, and the combined effects of wind pressure and temperature difference forces (WT method). Subsequently, the results were compared with each other by carrying out Pearson correlation analysis and developing a regression model. During each field experiment, continuous measurements of gas concentrations (NH3, CO2, CH4, and N2O) inside and outside the building and Kr-85 tracer gas experiments were carried out. Meanwhile, the temperature was measured and recorded inside and outside the barn. Furthermore, the wind velocity was measured. Although the WT method showed minor overestimation by about 1.11 (p < 0.05) times the reference method, it is not reliable because it showed no linear correlation (0.05; p = 0.88) with the reference method. This was due to large fluctuations in the wind velocity (direction and speed), which negatively affected the WT method, which is basically dependent on wind velocity. In contrast, the Kr-85 tracer gas technique showed a good linear correlation (0.82; p < 0.05) with the reference method, which accentuates that the Kr-85 tracer gas technique is a promising method. However, this technique overestimated the air exchange rate by about 2.05 (p < 0.05) times the reference method. Therefore, the Kr-85 tracer gas technique should be further developed to produce values consistent with those estimated by the reference method.

Dry mass (DM) specific oxygen consumption rates varied from 1.4 to 3.3 mu l O(2) (DM)(-1) h(-1), showing a pattern of developmental decline. In contrast, specific ammonia excretion rates fluctuated irregularly from 0.02 to 0.067 mu g NH(4)-N (DM)(-1) h(-1), yielding oxygen consumption to ammonia excretion ratios (O:N atomic ratio) as wide as 51-180. With progressive development, ash decreased from 34% to 17% of DM while C composition increased from 33% to 41% of DM. No consistent changing pattern with development was seen for water contents (74-83% of WM), N composition (6.9-9.5% of DM) and C:N ratios (4.0-5.1). Supplemental data of both specific oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion rates of laboratory-raised Stage III P. homarus and wild Parribacus antarcticus phyllosoma (stage unknown) of this study and literature data on phyllosomas of other lobster species by previous workers were shown to be comparable to those of P. ornatus phyllosomas when the differences in DM and temperature were taken into account. No appreciable differences due to the origin of the specimens, whether wild or laboratory-raised, were evident. Comparison of the present results with those of stomatopod larvae and holoplanktonic crustaceans in the same tropical marine habitats revealed that phyllosoma larvae are characterized by somewhat lower DM specific oxygen consumption rates and N composition. The study revealed markedly reduced ammonia excretion rates in phyllosomas, suggesting reduced swimming activity and preferential utilization of dietary protein to somatic growth rather than metabolism.

The animals were divided into 6 equal groups (A-F). Animals in groups A-E were infected with Trypanosoma brucei, and later treated on day 8 post infection (p.i.) with either melarsamine hydrochloride (Cymelarsan (R)) at 0.3 mg/kg (Group A) and 0.6 mg/kg (Group B) or diminazene aceturate (Berenil (R)) at 3.5 mg/kg (Group C) and 7.0 mg/kg (Group D). Animals in group E remained untreated while group F served as healthy controls. Parasitaemia was established by day 8 p.i. in all infected groups and eliminated by day 16 following treatment on day 8 p.i. with melarsamine hydrochloride (Cymelarsan (R)) (Groups A and B) or diminazene aceturate (Berenil (R)) (Group D). On the other hand, diminazene aceturate treatment (Berenil (R)) on day 8 p.i. at 3.5 mg/kg (Group C) caused a temporary disappearance of parasites from the circulation by day 16 p.i. but there was a relapse parasitaemia on day 44 with a peak count of 500 +/- 2.79 x 10(3) parasites/mu L of blood by day 52 p.i. In the infected/untreated group (E), parasitaemia fluctuated but attained the same peak as Group C by day 52 p.i. Increase in body temperatures (40.5 +/- 3.16 - 42.8 +/- 3.25 degrees C) occurred during the first wave of parasitaemia but declined to pre-infection values from day 28 p.i. in Groups A, B and D. In Groups C and E, there was a second wave of parasitaemia (P < 0.05) with peak counts of 42.4 +/- 0.81 X 10(3)/mu L and 41.8 +/- 0.80 x 10(3)/mu L respectively by day 52 p.i. A significant (P < 0.05) decline in packed cell volume was also noted by day 52 p.i. The major clinical signs observed in Groups C and E were pyrexia, inappetance, emaciation, anaemia, dullness, starry hair coat, pallor of buccal and ocular mucous membranes. Similarly, in Groups C and E, the testicles appeared oedematous and painful to touch with degenerative changes, morphological sperm abnormalities and oligospermia with 2.0% and 0% sperm reserves respectively. Sperm reserve was 100% in Groups A, B and D.

However, some recent work by H.C. Timm et al. (2002, Trees 16:47-62) has shown that quantum yield can be reduced for some time after leaves have been exposed to darkness. To investigate under what light conditions quantum yield can be reduced, we carried out a number of experiments on leaves of a partial-shade (unlit greenhouse)-grown Coleus blumei Benth. hybrid. We found that after leaves had been exposed to complete darkness, quantum yield was reduced by about 60%. Only very low light levels were needed for quantum yield to be fully restored, with 5 mumol quanta m(-2) s(-1) being sufficient for 85% of the quantum yield of fully induced leaves to be achieved. Leaves regained higher quantum yields upon exposure to higher light levels with an estimated time constant of 130 s. It was concluded that the loss of quantum yield would be quantitatively important only for leaves growing in very dense understoreys where maximum light levels might not exceed 5 mumol quanta m(-2) s(-1) even in the middle of the day. Most leaves, even in understorey conditions, do, however, experience light levels in excess of 5 mumol quanta m(-2) s(-1) over periods where they obtain most of their carbon so that the loss of quantum yield would affect total carbon gain of those leaves only marginally.",,,,,,"Kirschbaum, Miko/0000-0002-5451-116X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-0935,1432-2048,,,,APR,2004,218,6,,,,,1046,1053,,10.1007/s00425-003-1186-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-003-1186-1,,,,,,,,14722771,,,,,WOS:000220860900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seedling emergence was greatest (96%) for seeds placed on the soil Surface but declined with increased seed burial depth. No seedlings emerged from a depth of 4 cm. Seedling emergence and seedling dry matter declined with the addition of crop residue to the soil surface; however, higher quantities of residue than those normally found in low-yield systems were required to result in substantial reductions in emergence. Seed germination was tolerant of moderate salt concentrations (40 to 100 mM sodium chloride) and a broad range of pH (4 to 10) but was sensitive to low Osmotic Potentials (< -0.8 MPa).

But the magnitude and distribution of mixing across density surfaces are also important for the Earth's climate as well as the concentrations of organisms(1). Most of this mixing occurs where internal waves break, overturning the density stratification of the ocean and creating patches of turbulence. Predictions of the rate at which internal waves dissipate(2,3) were confirmed earlier at midlatitudes(4,5). Here we present observations of temperature and velocity fluctuations in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans between 42degreesN and 2degreesS to extend that result to equatorial regions. We find a strong latitude dependence of dissipation in accordance with the predictions(3). In our observations, dissipation rates and accompanying mixing across density surfaces near the Equator are less than 10% of those at mid-latitudes for a similar background of internal waves.

Environmental cues triggering this seasonal phenotypic transition have rarely been investigated, although they play a central role in the compensation of climatic fluctuations via plastic phenotypic adjustments. Initiation of winter daily torpor use-a widespread energy-saving phenotype-could be primarily timed according to anticipatory seasonal cues (anticipatory cues hypothesis), or flexibly fine-tuned according to actual energy availability (food shortage hypothesis). We conducted a food supplementation experiment on wild heterothermic primates (grey mouse lemurs, Microcebus murinus) at the transition to the food-limited dry season, i.e. the austral winter. As expected under the food shortage hypothesis, food-supplemented individuals postponed the seasonal transition to normal torpor use by 1-2 month(s), spent four times less torpid, and exhibited minimal skin temperature 6 A degrees C higher than control animals. This study provides the first in situ experimental evidence that food availability, rather than abiotic cues, times the launching of torpor use.

We explored endogenous dynamics of A. obliqua and A. ludens populations based on short sequences of time series data of adult captures from 2008 to 2010. Moreover, we analyzed the relationship between the rate of population change (Rt) and population density as an endogenous factor, and temperature, precipitation, fruit availability, and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAOi) as exogenous factors. Autocorrelation and partial-rate correlation functions were used to evaluate the endogenous dynamics of populations. Generalized least square models including autoregressive-moving-average structures were performed to assess the relationships between the Rt and endogenous and exogenous factors. Results revealed annual patterns in the population fluctuation for both Anastrepha obliqua and A. ludens. Anastrepha obliqua and A. ludens population peaks occurred from August to September-October, and from January to July, respectively. The dynamics of the Rt suggest persistent pest populations modulated by a first-order feedback structure, although higher orders in feedback structures were also exhibited.

Climate change, which is acknowledged as the most important factor in affecting plant performance, could be modulated by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. In this study, a total of 141 Chinese pine ( Pinus tabuliformis ) trees were studied to estimate tree-ring width. Based on tree-ring delta C-13 records, we measured the fluctuations in leaf intercellular CO2 (C-i) and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) since industrialization period on Hasi mountain, Gansu province. We found that the long-term variation of iWUE has been increasing since 1850. On average, 73% of the total variance in iWUE was explained by temperature, Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and CO2 concentration. Over 19 and 23% of the variance was attributed solely to drought stress and CO2 concentration, respectively. For BAI (basal area increment), nearly 50% of the variance was explained by temperature, SPEI and CO2, with 40% of the variance in tree growth attributed to drought stress. In addition, our results show that the positive relationship between tree growth and drought stress did not change over time. When there was a wetter condition, a larger proportion of higher tree growth occurred, otherwise more trees had lower tree growth. We therefore, conclude that despite the clear increase of iWUE, its beneficial effect of this higher iWUE on tree growth was overcome by drought stress at our study area.",,,,,"Yang, Bao/O-1541-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0931-1890,1432-2285,,,,JUN,2021,35,3,,,,,769,781,,10.1007/s00468-020-02075-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-020-02075-7,,JAN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000610023300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigated several time- and individual-specific factors as potential predictors of overall mortality and dispersal patterns, and of gender and age differences in these patterns. Time-specific covariates included minimum daily temperature, days below freezing, and abundance of a strong competitor, siskins (Carduelis spinus) during winter, and maximum temperature and rainfall during summer. Individual covariates included body mass (i.e. body condition), and wing length (i.e. flying ability), and interactions between body mass and environmental factors. We found little support of a predictive relationship between environmental factors and survival, but good evidence of relationships between body mass and survival, especially for juveniles. Juvenile survival appears to vary in a curvilinear manner with increasing mass, suggesting that there may exist an optimal mass beyond which increases are detrimental. The mass-survival relationship does seem to be influenced by at least one environmental factor, namely the abundance of wintering siskins. When siskins are abundant, increases in body mass appear to relate strongly to increasing survival. When siskin numbers are average or low the relationship is largely reversed, suggesting that the presence of strong competition mitigates the otherwise largely negative aspects of greater body mass. Wing length in juveniles also appears to be related positively to survival, perhaps largely due to the influence of a few unusually large juveniles with adult-like survival. Further work is needed to test these relationships, ideally under experimentation.",,,,,"Senar, Joan Carles/V-2371-2018","Senar, Joan Carles/0000-0001-9955-3892",,,,,,,,,,,,,0266-4763,,,,,JAN-MAR,2002,29,1-4,,,,,125,142,,10.1080/02664760120108674,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02664760120108674,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000173247600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Successful invasions depend on the interplay of multiple abiotic and biotic factors, however, the process of the invasion itself is often overlooked. The temporal variation of environmental factors suggests that a 'window of opportunity' for successful invasions exists. Especially aquatic habitats, like temperate lakes, undergo pronounced seasonal fluctuations and show temporally varying environmental conditions in e.g. nutrient availability, temperature and the composition of the resident community including competitors and consumers. We experimentally tested if an invasion window for the globally invasive cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii exists. From May to September, we determined the invasion success of C. raciborskii in laboratory mesocosms with natural lake water. Although the invasion success was generally low, the invasiveness varied among months and differed in total invasive biomass, net development and final share of C. raciborskii in the community. During the first days, C. raciborskii strongly declined and this initial, short-term decline was independent of the ambient consumptive pressure.

Finding evidence for the increased expression or silenced genes involved in metabolic pathways under the pressure of stress conditions and/or a given environment has been challenging for experimenters with this bacterial symbiotic model. Transcriptomic data have shown that Buchnera gene expression changes are confined to a narrow range when the aphids face brutal environmental variations. In this report, we demonstrate that instead of manipulating individual genes, the conditions may act on the relative mass of endosymbiont corresponding to the needs of the host.

Throughout the experiment, water quality (pH, O-2, N-NH3, N-NH4, NO2) was considered optimum. Two growth rate periods were observed on the population: first an acclimation period (weeks 1-5), followed by a period of general decrease in growth rate (weeks 5-25). This trend was modelled with a third-order polynomial function. The autocorrelation analysis of the fluctuations revealed a cyclicity of the growth rate with a 4-5-week period. This cyclicity was independent of the tanks and of the growth rate trend type (long- v. short-term acclimation period).

In particular, recent experiments have demonstrated that fuel-free propulsion can be achieved through the application of external magnetic fields on magnetic helically shaped structures. The magnetic interaction between helices and the rotating field induces a torque that rotates and propels them via the coupled rotational-translational motion. Recent works have shown that there exist certain optimal geometries of helical shapes for propulsion. However, experiments show that controlled motion remains a challenge at the nanoscale due to Brownian motion that interferes with the deterministic motion and makes it difficult to achieve controlled steering. In the present work we employ quantitatively accurate simulation methodology to design a setup for which magnetic nanohelices of 30 nm in radius and 180 nm in length (corresponding to previously determined optimal length to radius ratio of 6), with and without cargo, can be accurately propelled and steered in the presence of thermal fluctuations.

RCH has a well-established role in extending lower lethal limits, but its ability to prevent sublethal cold injury has received less attention. The Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica, is Antarctica's only endemic insect and has a well-studied RCH response that extends freeze tolerance in laboratory conditions. However, the discriminating temperatures used in previous studies of RCH are far below those ever experienced in the field. Here, we tested the hypothesis that RCH protects against non-lethal freezing injury. Larvae of B. antarctica were exposed to control (2 degrees C), direct freezing (-9 degrees C for 24 h) or RCH (-5 degrees C for 2 h followed by -9 degrees C for 24 h). All larvae survived both freezing treatments, but RCH larvae recovered more quickly from freezing stress and had a significantly higher metabolic rate during recovery. RCH larvae also sustained less damage to fat body and midgut tissue and had lower expression of two heat shock protein transcripts (hsp60 and hsp90), which is consistent with RCH protecting against protein denaturation. The protection afforded by RCH resulted in energy savings; directly frozen larvae experienced a significant depletion in glycogen energy stores that was not observed in RCH larvae. Together, these results provide strong evidence that RCH protects against a variety of sublethal freezing injuries and allows insects to rapidly fine-tune their performance in thermally variable environments.",,,,,"Kawarasaki, Yuta/AAD-4032-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,AUG,2019,222,15,,,,,,,jeb206011,10.1242/jeb.206011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.206011,,,,,,,,31345935,,,,,WOS:000481619200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

We report an in situ experiment in which a previously monitored colony of the coral Siderastrea stellata was found detached, overturned, buried, and bleached (95% of its surface). We reattached the coral to the reef and documented its recovery during 6 months by quantifying its surface area and health condition using 3D models derived from structure-from-motion photogametry of videos obtained in the field. The coral showed the first signs of recovery from a bright-white bleached state within 2 days and fully recovered to a healthy-like state in roughly 1 month, demonstrating that the endosymbiotic algal community recovered fast.

The physical mechanisms of the decadal variability are hypothesized to be associated with fluctuations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Perfect model predictability experiments using the GFDL CM2.1 climate model are analyzed to investigate the potential predictability of the AMOC. Results indicate that the AMOC is predictable up to 20 years. We further connect AMOC predictability to readily observable fields. We show that modeled surface and subsurface signatures of AMOC variations defined by characteristic patterns of sea surface height, subsurface temperature, and upper ocean heat content anomalies, have a potential predictability similar to the AMOC's. Since we have longer observational records for these quantities than for direct measurements of the AMOC, our study highlights a potentially new promising method for monitoring AMOC variations, and hence assessing the predictability of the real climate system.

Root growth reduction was more severe than leaf growth reduction and the timing of the transient growth reduction coincided with endogenous bursts of jasmonate (JA) and ethylene emissions reported in literature. The reaction of root growth was superimposed by a strong diel variation of root growth, which was caused by the fluctuating temperature to which the plants were exposed. Apart from the observed root growth reaction, other defense-related traits such as increased nicotine concentration, trichome length and density were activated within 72 h after wounding.

While foraging behavior of natural enemies has been extensively studied under controlled conditions, little is known on how odor-guided foraging behavior is influenced by fluctuating weather conditions in the field. Here we investigated how HIPV-guided foraging of Cotesia glomerata parasitoids is influenced by prevailing weather conditions in the field. C. glomerata females were released in 5 m radius circles of cabbage plants infested with Pieris brassicae caterpillars, and host finding success and direction of foraging activity was assessed by recapturing parasitoids on the host-infested plants. Wind speed and direction, humidity, barometric pressure and temperature was recorded and related to parasitoid foraging activity. Parasitoid foraging behavior was studied in more detail by observing individually released parasitoids in 0.5 m circles with host-infested cabbages. Recapture rates and movement direction of parasitoids was influenced by an interaction between humidity, wind speed, temperature and change in barometric pressure. High humidity and low wind speed was generally positively associated with host finding success. Direct observations of parasitoid flight behavior confirmed the influence of humidity and wind speed. Successful host finding in upwind direction was only observed at wind speeds below 3 m/s. Our study highlights the complex ways in which weather variables moderate parasitoid foraging behavior under field conditions. Since unfavorable weather conditions result in a strong reduction in parasitoid foraging efficiency, weather conditions are an important factor in the effectiveness of parasitoids as biocontrol agents.",,,,,"Bianchi, Felix JJA/B-6044-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-8809,1873-2305,,,,OCT 1,2020,301,,,,,,,,107066,10.1016/j.agee.2020.107066,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.107066,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000553393400035,View Full Record in Web of Science

After experiencing a period of arrested growth, individuals often show compensatory growth responses by modifying their life-history, behaviour and physiology. However, the strength of compensatory responses may vary across broad geographic scales as populations differ in their exposition to varying time constraints. We examined differences in compensatory growth strategies in common frog (Rana temporaria) populations from southern and northern Sweden. Tadpoles from four populations were reared in the laboratory and exposed to low temperature to evaluate the patterns and mechanisms of compensatory growth responses. We determined tadpoles' growth rate, food intake and growth efficiency during the compensation period. In the absence of arrested growth conditions, tadpoles from all the populations showed similar (size-corrected) growth rates, food intake and growth efficiency. After being exposed to low temperature for 1 week, only larvae from the northern populations increased growth rates by increasing both food intake and growth efficiency. These geographic differences in compensatory growth mechanisms suggest that the strategies for recovering after a period of growth deprivation may depend on the strength of time constraints faced by the populations. Due to the costs of fast growth, only populations exposed to the strong time constraints are prone to develop fast recovering strategies in order to metamorphose before conditions deteriorate. Understanding how organisms balance the cost and benefits of growth strategies may help in forecasting the impact of fluctuating environmental conditions on life-history strategies of populations likely to be exposed to increasing environmental variation in the future.",,,,,"Orizaola, Germán/A-5217-2008","Orizaola, Germán/0000-0002-6748-966X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,JAN,2014,174,1,,,,,131,137,,10.1007/s00442-013-2754-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2754-0,,,,,,,,23996230,,,,,WOS:000329624300013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fewer studies have examined seasonal metabolic acclimatization in subtropical or tropical species. We investigated seasonal metabolic variation in an Afrotropical ploceid passerine, the white-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali; approximate to 47 g), at three sites along a climatic gradient of approximately 7 degrees C in winter minimum air temperature (T-a). We measured M-sum (n 10 per site per season) in a helox atmosphere, BMR of the same birds at thermoneutrality (T-a approximate to 30 degrees C), and resting metabolic rates at 5 degrees C T-a 20 degrees C. Patterns of seasonal adjustments in BMR varied among populations in a manner not solely related to variation in seasonal T-a extremes, ranging from BMR approximate to 52% higher in winter than in summer to no seasonal difference. Greater cold tolerance was found in a population at a colder desert site, manifested as higher M-sum (approximate to 25% higher) and lower helox temperature at cold limit values compared with a milder, mesic site. Our results lend support to the idea that greater variance in the pattern of seasonal metabolic responses occurs in subtropical and tropical species compared with their temperate-zone counterparts and that factors other than T-a extremes (e.g., food availability) may be important in determining the magnitude and direction of seasonal metabolic adjustments in subtropical birds.",,,,,"Noakes, Matthew Jason/C-2312-2019","Noakes, Matthew Jason/0000-0002-1270-4422",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,1537-5293,,,,MAR-APR,2017,90,2,,,,,178,189,,10.1086/689030,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/689030,,,,,,,,28277960,,,,,WOS:000395771000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Significant site-to-site variability in nitrification rates and associated N2O emissions was observed under standardised conditions, indicating the need for site-specific model parameterisation. Generally, nitrification rates and N2O emissions increased with higher water content, ammonium concentration and temperature, although there were exceptions. It is recommended that site-specific model parameterisation be informed by such data. Importantly, the ratio of N2O emitted to net nitrified N under aerobic conditions was small (<0.2% for the majority of measurements) but did vary from 0.03% to 1%. Some models now include variation in the proportion of nitrified N emitted as N2O as a function of water content; however, strong support for this was not found across all of our experiments, and the results demonstrate a potential role of pH and ammonium availability.

Time series were analyzed to determine the influence of physical exchange processes on particulate matter at the shelf-edge, with a special emphasis on the Northern Current variability. The synoptic variability of the Northern Current was linked to meanders of 2-5 day period. Its meso-scale activity presented a seasonal signal with maximum values in early spring. Peaks of particulate fluxes in the upper traps were little affected by large river and atmospheric inputs, but rather by enhanced shelf-slope exchanges at the shelf edge due to intense cross-slope fluctuations of the Northern Current. These fluctuations caused cross-isobath flows near the bottom, which appeared to be a potential mechanism in transporting particles off the shelf. At 900 m depth, high-flux events measured by sediment traps were primarily linked to periods of higher cross-slope current oscillations. This correlation suggests that vertical motions caused by these oscillations contribute to the suspended particulate matter transport through the process of bringing higher suspended material concentrations from above to greater depths. Vertical velocity estimates were derived through temperature fluctuations combined with vertical temperature gradient and from the kinematic boundary condition. A simple diffusion model indicates that the vertical turbulent mixing of suspended particulate matter, induced by the cross-slope current oscillations, yields downward fluxes of particles comparable to those collected by sediment traps.

The enchytraeid populations showed a marked stratification in the same sequence. Freshly fallen pine needles were colonized by C. sphagnetorum, while other species followed much later. It was found that data from the litterbags were reasonably comparable with field data, when expressed per gram of dry substrate, but less so when expressed per square metre.

Analysis of trends in time series data from the catchments indicates increased rainfall and flow over the study period, particularly during the summer, with the difference between them, actual evaporation, declining markedly in both main and sub-catchments. A partial explanation for the reduction implicates a decline in atmospheric demand for moisture, caused by increased cloud interception of incoming radiation, colder air temperatures which lead to a lowering of the vapour capacity of the atmosphere and, most markedly, a decline of 30% in specific humidity deficits above the crop.

For the reason that greenhouse operations, such as heating and cooling, consume a large amount of energy. The thermal storage is important to minimize the cost of greenhouse production. Surplus air thermal energy (SATE) is available in greenhouses during all the year, even in the cold period, hence its use in greenhouse applications is possible. In this present work, a solar heating cooling system (SHCS) with quartzitic sandstone as thermal storage material to store and use the SATE in greenhouse production was operated for cooling and heating processes and its performance was evaluated during winter period. This system consists of a quartzitic sandstone and including thermal storage blocks and pipes with fans to manage those processes in greenhouse. This system was located in the Souss-Massa region, Morocco. The heating and cooling of inside air by SHCS can improve the greenhouse microclimate and tomato yield. The results show that the air temperature in greenhouse equipped with SHCS exceeds than that of the control one about 3 degrees C at night and 6 degrees C lower during day, with fewer fluctuations. Moreover, the relative humidity was 10% lower at night.

Carex is a group of species that has shown difficulties to germinate experimentally and also many of them failed in order to use in restoration projects. Our aim was to determine whether Carex elata and C. elongata that dominate in vegetation of Central European swamps differ in their germination strategy. We conducted germination experiments with stratified and unstratified seeds of both species to determine: 1) if they are able to germinate fresh, 2) if they exhibit a cyclic dormancy pattern, and 3) if they will germinate from a seed bank. We demonstrate fresh seed germination and no evidence of cyclic dormancy in either species. Stratification did not enhance final germination but it did accelerate germination. Seed bank seeds of both species germinate sparsely. We demonstrate that these coexisting Carex species differ with respect to final germination. The higher germination percentages of the fresh seeds compared to buried and seed bank seeds of both species probably reflect adaptation to fluctuating water-level conditions. In summary, these findings support a strategy of fresh germination in a highly-variable environment. Our study indicates that both C. elata and C. elongata are suitable for restoration projects. Successful establishment and revegetation with C. elongata may result simply from sowing fresh seeds. In contrast, seed sowing, combined with vegetatively produced seedling transplants is essential for the successful restoration of C. elata.",,,,,,"Douda, Jan/0000-0002-1205-364X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3088,1336-9563,,,,APR,2017,72,4,,,,,370,377,,10.1515/biolog-2017-0045,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2017-0045,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000402392500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigated the effects of two differing freeze-thaw regimes, each of which is realistic of in situ spatial and temporal variation in field conditions, on C and N dynamics in sub-arctic heath tundra mesocosms. In addition, N-15 isotopic label was used to follow the partitioning of a labile N pool between major ecosystem components, both during the freeze-thaw treatments phase, and in a subsequent equilibration phase. A single deep freeze treatment phase enhanced dissolved total and labelled N pools in the soil solution at initial thaw, and resulted in reduced pool sizes at the end of the equilibration phase. By contrast, a multiple freeze-thaw cycling treatment directly enhanced the dissolved labelled N pool, but did not significantly affect dissolved total N. Furthermore, both dissolved labelled N and dissolved total N pools were significantly enhanced in the equilibration period following multiple freeze-thaw, the latter due to a marked increase in soil solution NH4+. Microbial biomass C was not significantly affected by either of the freezing treatments upon final thaw, but was significantly reduced over the combined treatment and equilibration phases of the multiple freeze-thaw regimes. Furthermore, the treatments had no significant effects on total or labelled N within the microbial biomass over either phase. Total mesocosm CO2 efflux rates remained closely correlated with soil temperature throughout the experiment in both regimes, suggesting that respiratory flushes associated with treatment-induced microbial cell lysis were negligible. Together, these results indicate that moderate freeze-thaw fluctuations may have minimal influences on microbial biomass pools, but nevertheless can have strong contrasting effects on the amounts, forms, and timing of N and organic C supply into the soil solution. Ecosystem losses via N2O effluxes were of greatest magnitude immediately upon thawing in both treatments, and were of similar total magnitude to inorganic N leachates in throughflow. Herb leaves, total fine roots, and vascular stems accumulated some N-15 label in one or both of the freezing treatments by the end of the experiment. Together, these results indicating very small N losses relative to the magnitudes of internal transfers, suggest tight ecosystem N cycling both during and after freeze-thaw events. Furthermore, our small and subtle effects on microbial and soluble C and N pools relative to previous studies using more severe regimes, suggests that periods of moderate freeze-thaw fluctuations may have only a minor influence on the annual pattern of C and nutrient dynamics in seasonally cold ecosystems.

Both field and laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the possible roles of dew in growth of biomass and photosynthetic activity within cyanobacterial crust. The cyanobacteria, Microcoleus vaginatus Gom. and Scytonema javanicum (Kutz.) Born et Flah., were begun with stock cultures and sequential mass cultivations, and then the field experiment was performed by inoculating the inocula onto shifting sand for forming cyanobacterial crust during late summer and autumn of 2007 in Hopq Desert, northwest China. Measurements of dew amount and Chlorophyll a content were carried out in order to evaluate the changes in crust biomass following dew. Also, we determined the activity of photosystem II(PSII) within the crust in the laboratory by simulating the desiccation/rehydration process due to dew. Results showed that the average daily dew amount as measured by the cloth-plate method (CPM) was 0.154 mm during fifty-three days and that the crust biomass fluctuated from initial inoculation of 4.3 mu g Chlorophyll a cm(-2) sand to 5.8-7.3 mu g Chlorophyll a cm(-2) crust when dew acted as the sole water source, and reached a peak value of approximately 8.2 mu g Chlorophyll a cm(-2) crust owing to rainfalls. It indicated that there was a highly significant correlation between dew amounts and crust moistures (r = 0.897 or r = 0.882, all P < 0.0001), but not a significant correlation between dew and the biomass (r = 0.246 or r = 0.257, all P > 0.05), and thus concluded that dew might only play a relatively limited role in regulating the crust biomass. Correspondingly, we found that rains significantly facilitated biomass increase of the cyanobacterial crust. Results from the simulative experiment upon rehydration showed that approximately 80% of PSII activity could be achieved within about 50 min after rehydration in the dark and at 5 degrees C, and only about 20% of the activity was light-temperature dependent. This might mean that dew was crucial for cyanobacterial crust to rapidly activate photosynthetic activity during desiccation and rehydration despite low temperatures and weak light before dawn. It also showed in this study that the cyanobacterial crusts could receive and retain more dew than sand, which depended on microclimatic characteristics and soil properties of the crusts. It may be necessary for us to fully understanding the influence of dew on regulating the growth and activity of cyanobacterial crust, and to soundly evaluate the crust's potential application in fighting desertification because of the available water due to dew.

The mass transports estimated at the western, eastern and southern boundaries of the channel are characterized by fluctuations whose energy is concentrated around three different periods: 5, 14 and 2.8 days respectively. These three transports fluctuate along with the dominant EOF modes obtained at those 3 entrances respectively. The mean transport passing through the channel from east to west is about 0.28 Sv. There rue two frequency bands where winds and mass transports are coherent: 2.5-3.0 and 4.7-5.2 day bands. Winds on the northern shelf lead the transports in both bands by about 1.0 day. At the western half of the channel there is a recirculating (counterclockwise) mean transport of about 0.30 Sv. The time dependent part of the recirculating transport is coherent with the wind in the 4.7-5.2 day band where it also shows an absolute maximum of variance. nle recirculating transport lags the local downwelling-favorable winds by about 1.5 day and stems to be the channel response to wind relaxations with respect to its most persistent upwelling-favorable state. The main mean balance in the channel-integrated heat equation is between the heat transport passing through the western mouth, which cools off the channel, and the heat transport caused by the mass transport (the transport heat Bur), which warms: up the channel. This latter transport results from the advection of the temperature difference between the channel boundaries (mainly east and west) by the mass transport. There are no two terms that dominate the heat equation for the time dependent heat transports, but it can be simplified by balancing the along channel heat divergence (heat transport passing through the mouth plus transport heat flux), the vertical heat flux and the local change of heat. A clear thermal-wind balance at the eastern and western ends of the channel is found, in agreement with the work of Brink and Muench (1986) [Journal of Geophysical Research, 91, 877-895] and with the recent ADCP-CTD comparisons done by Richards (personal communication). All the terms in the heat equation show a variance peak in the 2-4 day band. It is found that when upwelling favorable winds blow on the northern shelf of the channel there is first a decrease or even a reversal, with respect to its mean, in the amplitude of thr transport heat flux. Next, a cooling of the Santa Barbara Channel is observed, followed by a loss of heat through the western mouth first and through the eastern mouth later, This whole process takes about 24 h to complete.

This calls for adaptation of farming systems to overcome this emerging challenge. Biochar, a product of biomass pyrolysis, with long-term evidence from Amazonia, might contribute to a climate-resilient farming system. This is due to its positive effects on soil chemical and physical properties resulting in increased crop yields, which has been experimentally demonstrated largely within the last two decades. In acidic low cation exchange capacity (CEC) soils, biochar derived from corncob at 5% application rate, for example, increased pH by >= 1 unit and CEC by >= 2 cmol(c) kg(-1) in addition to direct nutrient supply. Increased CEC may be linked to the observed increase in soil organic carbon content (biochar carbon/sequestered carbon) due to biochar addition. Sequestration of carbon due to biochar has been reported to be stronger in soils that have low pH and low carbon contents, with greater effects from biochars produced from woody materials or those produced at high temperature. Such soils with low pH and carbon contents are common in tropical areas. Another effect of biochar at field-relevant doses of <= 5% is the improvement of physical properties such as increased aggregate stability by up to 7%, increased aggregate mean weight diameter by 8-13%, increased soil water contents and reduced soil temperature fluctuations. Similar changes to soil properties have been found to increase yield by 10% based on global dataset, but up to fourfold increases have also been reported for acidic low CEC soils. One key challenge to implementation of biochar technology for increased yields is probably the unavailability of large quantity of biochar often in tens of Mg ha(-1) that is required for field application. Conservation agriculture (CA) with its three principles of minimum tillage, residue retention and crop diversification may partly address this key challenge of biochar implementation. This can be achieved by applying biochar only in the tilled part of land in a minimum tillage operation, which can be only 10% of the land surface. In this way, biochar may increase the positive attributes of CA such as increased rainwater harvesting and crop yields. Further solution to the quantity of biochar material for field application is the application of limited quantity of biochar in combination with traditional amendment such as manures either in mixtures or after co-composting. In this way, biochar is expected to deliver its benefits to manure resulting in improved soil properties and increased yields. Overall, incorporation of biochar in CA-based farming system alone or in combination with manures might contribute to building of climate-resilient agroecosystem.",,,,,"Martinsen, Vegard/H-9406-2014; Obia, Alfred/AAE-7257-2019","Martinsen, Vegard/0000-0002-7096-1806; Obia, Alfred/0000-0003-0960-7020; Munera Echeverri, Jose Luis/0000-0002-8162-9649",,,,,,,,,,,,,1610-2010,,978-3-030-12974-3; 978-3-030-12973-6,,,,2019,,,,,,,129,144,,10.1007/978-3-030-12974-3_6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-12974-3_6,10.1007/978-3-030-12974-3,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000489289500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The fish move over large areas and are exposed to different environments and ecological communities during the marine phase of the life cycle. Although the biomass of salmon in the ocean is very small compared with the biomass of other pelagic marine species, Atlantic salmon are still part of the marine ecosystem and subjected to fluctuations and changes in that system. The distribution of salmon in the sea is probably dependent on several environmental factors like surface temperature and surface currents. Furthermore, the oceanic distribution of salmon may probably also be determined by genetic components, for example that salmon have developed navigation systems that bring the fish to the right place at the right time, and thus maximize fitness. It is also reasonable to assume that the availability of suitable food organisms affects the distribution of salmon in the sea, as growth and survival are important fitness characters as well. Salmon spend most of their time in the ocean close to the water surface, and prey on different pelagic animals such as crustaceans, fish and squid. Several authors have suggested that Atlantic salmon are opportunistic feeders, but selective feeding has also been described. The abundance of Atlantic salmon in the north Atlantic has declined considerably in recent years. The decline is evident from most of the salmon distribution area, and is most pronounced for large salmon, but there appears to be no significant density-dependent mortality of salmon in the sea as there is in fresh water. The abundance of salmon is dependent on several factors such as smolt production, natural and man-made mortality. It has been shown that marine mortality accounts for a significant proportion of the decline, and is associated with a decline in the temperature to which post-smolts are exposed during the first months at sea. There are many factors thought to influence marine mortality of salmon. Although it has been suggested that the highest mortality takes place at the post-smolt stage, there are also indications that heavy mortality may occur later in the life cycle. Important sources of post-smolt mortality are predation, infestations of parasites and diseases, influences from freshwater life, as well as synergistic effects between these and a number of other factors. Furthermore, salmon may respond to changes in the ecosystem by altering their life histories, which may be seen by, for example, changes in growth rates, sea age at maturity and seasonal return pattern. Salmon are harvested in the ocean, but exploitation in commercial fisheries is now close to zero. On the other hand, recent information from surface trawling experiments in the Norwegian Sea has raised concern about the significance of by-catches of salmon post-smolts in pelagic fisheries for marine species.",,,,,"Jacobsen, Jan Arge/AAH-2455-2019","Jacobsen, Jan Arge/0000-0001-7497-8552",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0-632-06457-9,,,,2003,,,,,,,25,39,,10.1002/9780470995495.ch4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9780470995495.ch4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000189350500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In sea turtles, the recruitment success and remigration interval (the interval between two successive nesting seasons) are related to interannual variations in oceanographic conditions at the turtles' developmental habitats. However, the effect of low-frequency environmental variability has not been well documented. The relative changes in the numbers of nesting hawksbill turtles related to climate variability in the SGM and North Atlantic, during the 1980-2010 period, were analysed using the time series techniques to determine: 1) whether there are periodic signals in the series, and 2) whether any such signals parallel climate variations of similar frequency at local, regional and basin-wide spatial scales. A 7-year cycle in annual relative number of nesting hawksbill turtles in the SGM was found, which is superimposed upon a negative long-term trend. Both signals are inversely correlated with cycles of similar periodicity in the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST). These results suggest that the long-term population dynamics of hawksbill turtles in the SGM are related to a basin-wide, quasi-decadal environmental fluctuation in the North Atlantic. This relationship may be influenced by trophic interactions that are coupled to a decadal alternation between favourable and unfavourable ecological conditions occurring on basin-wide scales. Conservation planning for this species should focus on the potential effect of both linear increases in SST, as expected from current global warming trend, and long-term natural environmental variability.

Different combinations of hurdles can be quantified and compared to each other in terms of their inhibitory effect (iso-hurdle). We present here a methodology for establishing microbial iso-hurdle rules in three steps: (i) developing a predictive model based on existing but disparate data sets, (ii) building an experimental design focused on the iso-hurdles using the model output, and (iii) validating the model and the iso-hurdle rules with new data. The methodology is illustrated with Listeria monocytogenes. Existing data from industry, a public database, and the literature were collected and analyzed, after which a total of 650 growth rates were retained. A gamma-type model was developed for the factors temperature, pH, a(w), and acetic, lactic, and sorbic acids. Three iso-hurdle rules were assessed (40 logcount curves generated): salt replacement by addition of organic acids, sorbic acid replacement by addition of acetic and lactic acid, and sorbic acid replacement by addition of lactic/acetic acid and salt. For the three rules, the growth rates were equivalent in the whole experimental domain (gamma from 0.1 to 0.5). The lag times were also equivalent in the case of mild inhibitory conditions (gamma >= 0.2), while they were longer in the presence of salt than acids under stress conditions (gamma < 0.2). This methodology allows an assessment of the equivalence of inhibitory effects without intensive data generation; it could be applied to develop milder formulations which guarantee microbial safety and stability.",,,,,"guillou, sandrine/B-8352-2012","guillou, sandrine/0000-0002-0607-9229; Le Marc, Yvan/0000-0001-9188-7695; Membre, Jeanne-Marie/0000-0001-6751-4426",,,,,,,,,,,,,0099-2240,1098-5336,,,,FEB,2012,78,4,,,,,1069,1080,,10.1128/AEM.06691-11,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.06691-11,,,,,,,,22156426,,,,,WOS:000299918600021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies in a variety of ecosystems have shown that ecologically and economically important benthic and bentho-pelagic fishes avoid hypoxic (<2 mg O-2 L-1) habitats by moving vertically or horizontally to more oxygenated areas. While avoidance of hypoxic conditions generally leads to a complete shift away from preferred benthic prey, some individual fish continue to consume benthic prey items in spite of bottom hypoxia, suggesting complex habitat utilisation and foraging patterns. For example, Lake Erie yellow perch (Perca flavescens) continue to consume benthic prey, despite being displaced vertically and horizontally by hypolimnetic hypoxia. 2. We hypothesised that hypolimnetic hypoxia can negatively affect yellow perch by altering their distribution and inducing energetically expensive foraging behaviour. To test this hypothesis, we used drifting hydroacoustics and trawl sampling to quantify water column distribution, sub-daily vertical movement and foraging behaviour of yellow perch within hypoxic and normoxic habitats of Lake Erie's central basin during August-September 2007. We also investigated the effects of rapid changes in ambient oxygen conditions on yellow perch consumption potential by exposing yellow perch to various static and fluctuating oxygen conditions in a controlled laboratory experiment. 3. Our results indicate that, while yellow perch in general avoid hypoxic conditions, some individuals undertake foraging forays into hypoxic habitats where they experience greater fluctuations in abiotic conditions (pressure, temperature and oxygen concentration) than at normoxic sites. However, laboratory results suggest short-term exposure to low oxygen conditions did not negatively impact consumption potential of yellow perch. 4.

This and other evidence reported in the literature convincingly demonstrated that the probe accurately reads xylem pressure and xylem pressure responses to osmotic stress. Additional experiments were performed on plants grown in a greenhouse at a subtropical latitude. Under these conditions the plants were exposed to strong diurnal fluctuations in light intensity, relative humidity and temperature. The results showed that the absolute xylem pressure in the roots of untreated plants decreased with increasing transpiration rate from positive values in the early morning to negative values around noon (average value -0.15 MPa; maximum negative value -0.57 MPa). As the day progressed and the transpiration rate decreased, xylem pressure increased again to positive values. Correspondingly, the radial reflection coefficient for NaCl increased from about zero in the early morning to about unity at noon when transpiration reached its highest value and decreased again to very low values towards the evening.

Though seasonal variation in the expression of sexual traits is evident (e.g. conspicuous breeding plumage in birds), little attention has been given to short-lived organisms that inhabit relatively stable environments throughout their own lifetime but are exposed to strong environmental variation across generations. Some insects have evolved seasonal polyphenism to cope with intergenerational variation in environmental selection, yielding alternative phenotypes better suited for the environment in which they occur. Here we use mycalesine butterflies, which express distinct seasonal forms in response to wet-dry seasonal environments, to explore whether seasonal polyphenism extends to secondary sexual traits. Sex pheromones, which are produced by androconial patches on the wings of males, are a key determinant of mating success in these species. Through a series of field sampling, reaction norm experiments, pheromone titre quantification, and mate competition experiments, this study reveals that the size of the androconial patch on the forewing is mediated by the temperatures experienced during development, which correspond to the ecological conditions during the alternative wet and dry seasons in the wild. Furthermore, in one of the species, Bicyclus anynana, larger forewing patches are associated with both an increase in the production of pheromone components as well as the likelihood of mating. Taken together, these findings indicate that plasticity in androconial patches may be an adaptation to seasonal fluctuations in the environment as it favours reproductive success in the conditions in which each seasonal form flies.

Incomplete reversibility of mid-winter deacclimation in emerald ash borer,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis, Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is a wood-boring invasive pest devastating North American ash (Fraxinus spp.). A. planipennis overwinters primarily as a freeze-avoiding prepupa within the outer xylem or inner bark of the host tree. The range of this species is expanding outward from its presumed introduction point in southwestern Michigan. We hypothesized that loss of cold tolerance in response to mid-winter warm spells could limit survival and northern distribution of A. planipennis. We determined whether winter-acclimatised A. planipennis prepupae reduced their cold tolerance in response to mid-winter warm periods, and whether this plasticity was reversible with subsequent cold exposure. Prepupae subjected to mid-winter warm spells of 10 and 15A degrees C had increased supercooling points (SCPs) and thus reduced cold tolerance. This increase in SCP was accompanied by a rapid loss of haemolymph cryoprotectants and the loss of cold tolerance was not reversed when the prepupae were returned to -10A degrees C. Exposure to temperatures fluctuating from 0 to 4A degrees C did not reduce cold hardiness. Only extreme warming events for several days followed by extreme cold snaps may have lethal effects on overwintering A. planipennis populations. Thus, distribution in North America is likely to be limited by the presence of host trees rather than climatic factors, but we conclude that range extensions of invasive species could be halted if local climatic extremes induce unidirectional plastic responses.",,,,,,"Sinclair, Brent/0000-0002-8191-9910",,,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,JAN,2012,14,1,,,,,115,125,,10.1007/s10530-011-9988-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-011-9988-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000298646200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

A prolonged recruitment phase occurred in conditions that could be considered a proxy of a rainy season (16 degrees C, 10: 14 L: D and low conductivity) or of long hydroperiods (spring thermal fluctuating regime and intermediate conductivity). At 24 degrees C, age at reproduction of females from resting eggs almost doubled at low conductivity (in comparison with high conductivity). Low conductivity also reduced hatching time of resting eggs while it increased development time and age at maturity. In thermal fluctuating regime, degree-days to reproduction were about double than at constant 24 degrees C. Males, observed in all microcosms, reached maturity faster and had a shorter life span than females. Males initially outnumbered females, but later in the experiments females became dominant. We also evaluated the effect of conductivity and thermal regimes on other traits like recruitment from egg bank, voltinism and sex ratio.

We combined a field experiment limiting access to nests by mammalian predators with modeling of long-term field data of American redstarts (Parulidae: Setophaga ruticilla) to assess the effects of multiple environmental variables on breeding success and population limitation. Experimental treatment (baffles placed around tree boles beneath active nests; n = 71) increased nesting success of this single-brooded species significantly (77 vs 50% in controls; n = 343), demonstrating that scansorial mammals, primarily red squirrels Tamiasciurus hudsonicus and eastern chipmunks Tamias striatus, reduced reproductive success. Based on unbaffled nests (n = 466), daily nest survival varied annually, and was positively influenced by May temperature and negatively by sciurid nest predator abundance. Daily nest survival was also influenced positively by June rainfall, and declined with nest age but not with calendar date. Since nest failure was overwhelmingly caused by nest predation, these significant climate and nest-age effects in our models are indirect, likely influencing nest predator and/or nesting bird behaviors that in turn influenced nest predation. Redstart population density had no effect on nesting success, after accounting for other factors. Annual reproductive success accounted for 34% of the variability in annual population change in redstarts in our study area.

This adverse phenomenon is currently amplified by global climate change, which intensifies the aridization rates.

Populations on 2-3 grids of 1 ha were livetrapped at 3- to 8-week intervals in summer and winter except in 5 years of very low populations. Densities ranged from 10/ha to 250/ha. Peak densities occurred in 6 years and an extended low phase occurred from 1999 to 2003. Fluctuations of 3-4 years appeared in our populations but were not always present. Breeding occurred both in summer and winter, and the best predictor of the population growth rate was the fraction of adult females lactating in summer or winter, thereby supporting H-1. Juvenile production (number of juveniles/lactating female) varied greatly among years with the mean being over two times higher in low (2.41) than high (1.08) years, thereby supporting H-2. There was no clear correlation between population changes and either seasonal temperatures or rainfall, or any combination of these two variables, and no obvious cause of the prolonged low from 1999 to 2003.

Larval amphibians are concurrently exposed to biological stressors, such as competition and predation, as they often co-occur in diverse, multi-species assemblages. Thus, to accurately predict species' response to climate change, we empirically tested the interaction between a biotic and abiotic driver. We focused on three amphibian species that overlap in distribution and phenology across high elevations of the Cascade Mountain Range of the U.S. Pacific Northwest: the Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla), Cascades frog (Rana cascadae), and Western toad (Anaxyrus boreas). Amphibians in this region are threatened by drought-induced habitat loss resulting from the shortened hydroperiod and, in some areas, complete elimination of seasonal wetlands. We conducted a fully factorial experiment to determine the interactive effects of competition and drying on amphibian growth, development, and survival. We found that the impact of drying on each species was largely dependent upon interspecific competition dynamics. Competitive interactions, particularly in the three-species competition treatment, exacerbated the effects of drying, with both competition- and context-dependent responses to these stressors. Through an analysis of species-level effects, as well as an examination of secondary productivity (i.e., total biomass across treatments), we determined that Cascades frogs are the dominant competitor in this system owing to their larger body size and relative ability to withstand the stress of a rapidly drying hydroperiod. Our results suggest that ignoring biotic interactions in predictions of species response to climate change factors may be misleading.",,,,,"Thurman, Lindsey/AAF-7056-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,DEC,2019,10,12,,,,,,,e02950,10.1002/ecs2.2950,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2950,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000510015700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study characterizes the ASL flows over real urban morphology using wind tunnel experiments. The building models of downtown Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong are fabricated by 3D printing. The vertical profiles (3 x 45 numbers) on three vertical planes in the streamwise direction are selected for velocity measurements by constant-temperature (CT) hot-wire anemometry (HWA). There exist noticeable variations of mean wind speed (u) over bar, fluctuating velocities u and w together with vertical momentum flux uw in the ISL and RSL over urban areas. On the plane with maximum drag coefficient C-d (25% higher than that on the other two), the RSL is thicker by 10% in which the winds evolve in response to individual buildings. A new analytical solution is derived to improve the prediction of ASL mean wind speeds whose root-mean-square error (RMSE) is reduced by 10 times. Its key variable, the RSL constant, converges asymptotically mu = 1.7 for urban setting. Unlike the ISL, turbulence statistics show that the RSL velocities are positively skewed (S-u > 0) with high kurtosis (K-u > 3). The occurrence of ejection Q2 (detrainment; 32%-37%) is more frequent than sweep Q4 (entrainment; 30%-32%).

Here, we used spatiotemporal variation in tropical montane climate as a natural experiment to compare the importance of biotic versus abiotic drivers in regulating arthropod biomass. We combined intensive field data on arthropods, leaf phenology and in situ weather across a 1700-3100 m elevation and rainfall gradient, along with desiccation-resistance experiments and multi-decadal modelling. We found limited support for biotic drivers with weak increases in some herbivorous taxa on shrubs with new leaves, but no landscape-scale effects of leaf phenology, which tracked light and cloud cover. Instead, rainfall explained extensive interannual variability with maximum biomass at intermediate rainfall (130 mm month(-1)) as both 3 months of high and low rainfall reduced arthropods by half. Based on 50 years of regional rainfall, our dynamic arthropod model predicted shifts in the timing of biomass maxima within cloud forests before plant communities transition to seasonally deciduous dry forests (mean annual rainfall 1000-2500 mm vs. <800 mm). Rainfall magnitude was the primary driver, but during high solar insolation, the 'drying power of air' (VPDmax) reduced biomass within days contributing to drought related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Highlighting risks from drought, experiments demonstrated community-wide susceptibility to desiccation except for some caterpillars in which melanin-based coloration appeared to reduce the effects of evaporative drying. Overall, we provide multiple lines of evidence that several months of heavy rain or drought reduce arthropod biomass independently of deep-rooted plants with the potential to destabilize insectivore food webs.",,,,,,"Newell, Felicity L./0000-0002-7944-8603; Ausprey, Ian/0000-0002-7127-2746",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/gcb.16379,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16379,,SEP 2022,,,,,,36102197,,,,,WOS:000853323300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Simulations of the full trimer in the absence of water and the membrane led to significant contraction of the channel in the interior of each beta-barrel. With very weak harmonic constraints (0.005 kcal/mol Angstrom(2)/atom) applied to the main-chain C-alpha atoms of the beta-barrel, the structure was stabilized without alteration of the average fluctuations. The resulting distribution of the fluctuations (small for beta-strands, large for loops and turns) is in good agreement with the x-ray B factors. Dynamic cross-correlation functions showed the importance of coupling between the loop motions and barrel flexibility. This was confirmed by the application of constraints corresponding to the observed temperature factors to the barrel C-alpha atoms. With these constraints, the beta-barrel fluctuations were much smaller than the experimental values because of the intrinsic restrictions on the atomic motions, and the loop motions were reduced significantly. This result indicates that considerable care is required in introducing constraints to keep proteins close to the experimental structure during simulations, as has been done in several recent studies, Loop 3, which is thought to be important in gating the pore, undergoes a displacement that shifts it away from the x-ray structure.

In the Mediterranean, specialized companies are still unfamiliar with green roof installation because they consider dry conditions and appropriate plant selection as obstacles. Also in a temperate maritime climate, green roof design and vegetation composition need to be adapted to account for the projected climate changes, including an increase in temperature and more irregular precipitation events. This paper discusses the results of a two-year experiment on unirrigated extensive green roofs which were constructed in both a Mediterranean (Avignon, France) and a temperate maritime climate (Heverlee, Belgium) and on which 18 drought-adapted plants with Mediterranean habitat affinities were tested. Experimental plots differed in solar exposure and substrate type (substrate depth of 5 cm and 5 or 10 cm above a water retention layer). Climatic conditions affected vegetation development in both locations, with fluctuating cover values in the Mediterranean reflecting the impacts of summer droughts and rainy autumn periods. Overall, the deepest substrate depth of 10 cm with a water retention layer resulted in the highest cover and abundance values and the highest species diversity throughout the experiment. Both bryophytes and weeds established spontaneously over the two years, and their importance in terms of biodiversity value is discussed. To improve functional biodiversity of the extensive green roof, we advise to use succulent species together with annuals, perennial herbs and geophytes. The design and species recommendations shed some light on the possibilities for extensive green roof design in regions with summer drought and irregular precipitation and regions facing climate change.

Constraints on the ice cap evolution are combined with climatic records in a numerical ice flow surface mass balance (SMB) model to better understand the palaeoenvironmental and climatic evolution of this region. Our simulations suggest that after disconnecting from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) the ice cap had roughly its present-day size and geometry around 9-8.5 ka BR During the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) the southern part of the ice cap is modelled to collapse, while the northern part of the ice cap survived this warmer period. The late Holocene regrowth of the ice cap to its maximum Neoglacial extent at the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) can be reproduced from the temperature reconstruction. The simulations suggest that over the last millennia the local precipitation may have been up to 70-80% higher than at present. By coupling the pre-industrial temperature forcing to a post-LIA warming trend, it is suggested that the warming between the end of the LIA and the period 1961-1990 was between 1 and 2 degrees C. In all experiments the ice flow model complexity and horizontal resolution have only a minor effect on the long-term evolution of the ice cap. We further conclude that the glacial isostatic adjustment has a significant effect on the modelled Holocene ice cap evolution. This suggests that modelling studies of millennial-scale ice cap evolution should focus on SMB and boundary conditions, rather than on complex ice dynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Two alternating drainage configurations, related to repeated subglacial flooding events, are involved in this transformation: (i) significant meltwater discharge, high hydraulic connectivity and ice-bed decoupling during flooding events lead to hydraulic alteration of ribbed bedforms by erosion, sediment deposition and channel incision, while (ii) limited meltwater flow, low hydraulic connectivity and ice-bed recoupling that follow flooding events lead to their deformational reshaping into murtoos.

The system was used to investigate suspended clay influence on phosphorus acquisition (load buffering) by lotic periphyton. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity represent the greatest sources of variation in the distribution and activity of aquatic biota in natural systems. Imposing experimental treatments, simultaneously addresses temporal variation. Spatial variability is managed by controlling physical and chemical variables such as temperature, light, substrate, flow, and water quality Controlling environmental conditions leads to reduced variation in biotic state, which improves the measurement of biotic processes. This artificial stream design minimizes water volume fluctuation, which facilitates solution manipulation and measurement and reduces environmental variation.

The emission of all gases varied during the growth of the pigs. For example, the highest value of CH4 emission rate was four times as high as the lowest during the experimental period In addition, all gas emissions have a typical diurnal fluctuation. The gas emission value observed at the peak hours (1:00-2:00 P.M.) was twice as high as that observed around 6:00 A.M., even though the room temperature was kept at around 17 degrees C. Those variations may explain why the results presented by other authors differed so much.

Epiphytes have the potential to modify the canopy environments in which they grow. Accurately evaluating the impact of epiphytes can be challenging, since plants without epiphytes may also otherwise differ from host plants, and experimental removal is impractical and difficult to replicate in many forests. 2. We studied the impacts of epiphytes (primarily fruticose lichens and Tillandsia spp.) on host plants (Eulychnia saint-pieana and Caesalpinia spinosa) in two fog ecosystems in Chile (Pan de Azucar) and Peru (Atiquipa). These desert ecosystems sustain very high epiphyte loads and depend heavily on fog-water inputs. Using a combination of artificial substrates and epiphyte removals, we show significant impacts of epiphytes on their host plants. 3. The presence of epiphytes reduced throughfall volumes, reducing fog and rainfall inputs to the soil beneath host plant canopies. 4. Soil moisture loss rate was increased below cacti after removal of epiphytes from sun-facing but not shade-facing branches. This suggests epiphyte effects on hosts are microclimatic. 5. Epiphytes also buffered temperature fluctuations and reduced daytime vapour pressure deficit. 6.

Water status, productivity and survival rate of Salvia officinalis L. plants growing in experimental green roof modules were monitored between early spring and late summer. Experimental data showed that: (a) substrate and water retention layer retained respectively 34% and 90% in volume of water potentially available to plants; (b) water retention layer had a positive effect on plant water status and survival; (c) the design of the overall green roof system, and in particular the characteristics of the drainage layer, influenced the amount of water transferred between different green roof elements, thus significantly influencing the amount of water available to plants. In particular, significant amounts of water were shown to be transferred from the retention layer into the cavities of the plastic drainage layer in response to temperature fluctuations, leading to day/night cycles of water evaporation/condensation.

Methods: To better understand natural variation in desiccation resistance in this species, the effects of variation in larval food availability and access to water as an adult on subsequent phenotypic quality and desiccation resistance of adult females of the Mopti chromosomal form were tested experimentally. Results: It was found that, under normal conditions, larval food availability and adult access to water had only small direct effects on female wet mass, dry mass, and water, glycogen and body lipid contents corrected for body size. In contrast, when females subsequently faced a strong desiccation challenge, larval food availability and adult access to water had strong carry-over effects on most measured physiological and metabolic parameters, and affected female survival. Glycogen and water content were the most used physiological reserves in relative terms, but their usage significantly depended on female phenotypic quality.

Under well-watered conditions, a 'baseline' is derived that is crop specific and presumed fairly constant, despite differences in development and physiology. This study reports changes in the baseline of the CWSI for lucerne crops not subjected to water shortage over 3 years. Studies of lucerne in California from April 1986 to October 1988 used the CWSI to plan irrigations. It was necessary to re-establish the baseline periodically throughout the experiment. In the first year it was similar to that reported in the literature, but in the second year it had a statistically significant steeper slope and higher intercept. In the third year, the regression equation was similar to that in the first year. The changes in the baseline are thought to be a result of crop age rather than year-to-year weather fluctuations.

Sanitisation of sewage sludge can be achieved by treatment with quick lime, a process that destroys sludge pathogens in two ways: pH increase and temperature rise. Among the pathogens of epidemiological relevance, Ascaris eggs are the most resistant to liming, and, hence, may serve as indicators of hygienic quality of biosolids. This research aims at defining, between 50degreesC and 60degreesC, the time required in the case of limed sludge to obtain a product with a negligible level of viable Ascaris eggs. To achieve this objective, investigations on inactivation kinetics of Ascaris eggs were conducted in the following products: contaminated milk of lime; naturally contaminated sludge treated with slaked lime and heat; naturally contaminated sludge treated with quick lime; and sludge treated at full scale with quick lime. For the inactivation kinetics where a negligible level of Ascaris eggs was reached, the inactivation threshold was determined.

The spectra of bioluminescence intensity fluctuations qualitatively resemble the spectra of temperature or fluid velocity fluctuations in an appropriate turbulent thermal convection system.

Our field data indicated that the inter-annual variation of WBP was closely related to the seasonal climate of both winter air temperature and spring precipitation. The inter-plot variation of WBP was highly associated with basal area, biomass, and frequency of Quercus spp. in the plots, and correlations of the inter-plot variation with the stand characteristics of the specific species were stronger than those with slope and soil water content. Our results suggest that the annual fluctuation of forest productivity is primarily governed by severe climate in a season of the year, and the spatial distribution of a dominant species largely represent plot variation in the productivity. Our findings contribute to an enhanced understanding of climatic effects on the annual variability of forest productivity and the spatial heterogeneity of the productivity, which are extensively concerned with forested ecosystems of Korea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0912-3814,1440-1703,,,,JUL,2010,25,4,,,,,757,769,,10.1007/s11284-010-0705-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-010-0705-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000279683000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, complex interactions between water availability, light intensity, and temperature fluctuations make it difficult to develop standardised properties to monitor performance under field conditions. Sugar alcohols have been shown to function as stress metabolites, demonstrating considerable promise for use as bio-indicators of stress tolerance. This experiment monitored the accumulation of metabolites, including that of the sugar alcohol D-pinitol, in 3 chickpea genotypes grown under field conditions during reproductive stages of development. Further, compound specific carbon isotope abundance (C-13) of these compounds was quantified to investigate the influence on predictions of water use efficiency. It was found that the magnitude of water deficit did not instigate significant responses in metabolite abundance, however, concentrations of D-pinitol increased significantly over reproductive stages, indicating the accumulation of this sugar alcohol may be under significant developmental control. Significant differences in the C-13 of D-pinitol compared to other metabolites indicate this compound imparts a substantial effect over concentration-weighted predictions of water use efficiency obtained from the soluble fraction of leaves, especially as its proportion in the soluble fraction increases with plant development.",,,,,"Merchant, Andrew/C-8689-2011; Merchant, Andrew/AAQ-4592-2021","Merchant, Andrew/0000-0001-8979-6786; Merchant, Andrew/0000-0001-8979-6786; Dumschott, Kathryn/0000-0002-9905-4011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2073-4395,,,,JUL,2018,8,7,,,,,,,115,10.3390/agronomy8070115,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy8070115,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000440203900019,View Full Record in Web of Science

In mixed glycerol/water (G/W) mixtures the dissociating ligand rebinds with a yield close to 1 due to the cavities formed by the solvent whereas in pure water the ligand can diffuse into the solvent after photodissociation. In the G/W mixture, only geminate rebinding on the subpicosecond and 5 ps time scales was found and the rebinding fraction is unity which compares well with available experiments. Contrary to that, simulations in pure water find two time scales -similar to 10 ps and similar to 200 ps - indicating that both, geminate rebinding and rebinding after diffusion of NO in the surrounding water contribute. The rebinding fraction is around 0.63 within 1 ns which is in stark contrast with experiment. Including ions (Na and Cl) at 0.15 M concentration in water leads to rebinding kinetics tending to that in the glycerol/water mixture and yields agreement with experiments. The effect of temperature is also probed and found to be non-negligible.

A central element of the model is a negative correlation between the concentrations of soluble carbohydrates and nitrate in the cell sap, a correlation which reflects the equivalent roles of nitrate and organic solutes in the maintenance of cell turgor. A conventional carbon balance model was used to predict the fluctuations of soluble carbohydrates as a function of time. The carbohydrate-to-nitrate correlation was then used to compensate for these fluctuations by adjusting the nitrate concentration. The concentration of carbohydrates in the non-structural buffer (vacuoles) is determined by the balance between source activity (supply of carbohydrates by photosynthesis, controlled by light and CO,) and sink activity (demand for carbohydrates by growth and maintenance, controlled by temperature). As a result, winter conditions, characterized by source-limited growth, result in a depletion of carbon from the cell sap and, via the negative correlation, in a high nitrate concentration. Conversely, summer conditions result in low nitrate levels. A fair agreement was obtained when the model was tested with an available experimental data set for all-year-round production of greenhouse lettuce in Northern Germany.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,90-6605-750-5,,,,1998,,456,,,,,189,197,,10.17660/ActaHortic.1998.456.21,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.1998.456.21,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000074631600021,View Full Record in Web of Science

In vitro experiments are widely used to forecast reef-building coral health into the future, but often fail to account for the complex ecological and biogeochemical interactions that govern reefs. Consequently, observations from coral communities under naturally occurring extremes have become central for improved predictions of future reef form and function. Here, we present a semi-enclosed lagoon system in New Caledonia characterised by diel fluctuations of hot-deoxygenated water coupled with tidally driven persistently low pH, relative to neighbouring reefs. Coral communities within the lagoon system exhibited high richness (number of species = 20) and cover (24-35% across lagoon sites). Calcification rates for key species (Acropora formosa, Acropora pulchra, Coelastrea aspera and Porites lutea) for populations from the lagoon were equivalent to, or reduced by ca. 30-40% compared to those from the reef. Enhanced coral respiration, alongside high particulate organic content of the lagoon sediment, suggests acclimatisation to this trio of temperature, oxygen and pH changes through heterotrophic plasticity.

Merr.) cultivation on drained peats could affect the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere and also the leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Carbon dioxide emission needs to be partitioned before deciding on whether cultivated peat is net sink or net source of carbon. Partitioning of CO2 emission into root respiration, microbial respiration, and oxidative peat decomposition was achieved using a lysimeter experiment with three treatments: peat soil cultivated with pineapple, bare peat soil, and bare peat soil fumigated with chloroform. Drainage water leached from cultivated peat and bare peat soil was also analyzed for DOC. On a yearly basis, CO2 emissions were higher under bare peat (218.8 t CO2 ha/yr) than under bare peat treated with chloroform(205 t CO2 ha/yr), and they were the lowest (179.6 t CO2 ha/yr) under cultivated peat. Decreasing CO2 emissions under pineapple were attributed to the positive effects of photosynthesis and soil autotrophic activities. An average 235.7mg/L loss of DOC under bare peat suggests rapid decline of peat organic carbon through heterotrophic respiration and peat decomposition.

Changes in chamber [CO2] resulted, in turn, from substantial daily fluctuations in ambient [CO2], typical of the Los Angeles environment, with a constant offset caused by photosynthesis and respiration of the plants within the chamber, The dominant role of the stomatal response to CO2 in the control of aperture tvas confirmed by manipulation of chamber [CO2]. Fast (15 min) increases and decreases in [CO2] caused rapid decreases and increases in aperture, while constant [CO2] resulted in constant aperture. In contrast, aperture changes in comparable plants grown under greenhouse conditions were tightly correlated with changes in incident solar radiation (r(2)=0.80), and poorly correlated with changes in [CO2] (r(2)=0.09).

Measurements of physiological parameters or molecular analyses often represent single shot experiments. To study desiccation acclimation of filamentous cyanobacteria, the founders and main primary producers in desert biological soil crusts (BSC), we constructed an environmental chamber that can reproducibly and accurately simulate ambient conditions and measure microorganism performance. We show that recovery from desiccation of BSC cyanobacteria and Leptolyngbya ohadii isolated thereof are strongly affected by dehydration rate following morning dew. This effect is most pronounced in cells exposed to high light and temperature in the dry phase. Simultaneous measurements of water content, gas exchange and fluorescence were performed during dehydration.

In contrast, photosynthetic rates measured using O-2 evolution and CO2 uptake increased during rising irradiance to the point where the water content declined below approximate to 50%. Thus, fluorescence cannot serve as a reliable measure of photosynthesis in desert cyanobacteria.

Fecundity of Gammarus fossarum populations at six stream sites (S1-S6) and G. roeseli populations at two sites (S5 and S6) was studied monthly during 1985-1988, distinguishing seven morphological stages of embryonic development. Mean survival of G. fossarum eggs was 65% (60-70%) in nature and 60% (57-63%) in the laboratory; egg survival of G. roeseli was 52% (46-58%) in nature and 41% (35-47%) in the laboratory. Regressions of egg numbers per clutch against body wet weight (WWT) decreased significantly for egg developmental stages 2 to 7 (hatching). 2. In stream populations, ovigerous females of G. fossarum were absent in October (six sites) and November (five sites); ovigerous G. roeseli were usually absent from October until March. 3. Overall mean egg volume (EV) increased significantly from 0.08 +/- 0.001 mm3 and 0.075 +/- 0.001 mm3 for stage 2 eggs, to 0. 174 +/- 0.012 and 0. 160 +/- 0.013 mm3 for stage 6 eggs of G. fossarum and G. roeseli, respectively. The dry weights of stage 2 eggs, stage 6 eggs and neonates (stage 7) were not significantly different, within and between species; mean dry weight was 36 +/- 3 mug. 4. Egg volumes and fecundity indices (FI, weight-specific number of eggs per clutch) were not significantly different between the same months of four successive years, so the data were pooled to give a single representative 'year'. At most sites there were marked seasonal fluctuations in these variables. In both species, mean EV was largest for 'winter' eggs in December/January and smallest for 'summer' eggs in May. EV decreased during some months of the year when FI increased, and vice versa. Mean reproductive effort (RE = EV X FI) declined from high 'winter' values to low 'summer' values, and this difference was most marked at sites where the major foodstuff available was seasonally limited (autumn-shed tree leaves). Overall ('annual') mean RE was also lowest at these sites (S3 and S4) but was some 13% greater at sites where nutrients and food were present in the greatest quantities (S5 and S6). Specific maximum potential body sizes and hence maximum potential fecundities (fifty-nine eggs for G. fossarum and eighty-seven eggs for G. roeseli) were attained only at S5 and S6. Mean RE was nearly identical for G. fossarum and G. roeseli from the same sites. 5. At experimental temperatures (T) in the range 3.8-20.2-degrees-C, females of the same body weight carried significantly different egg numbers per clutch. The relationship between FI and T was described by a second-order polynomial. The calculated optimum T was 12.1-degrees-C for G. fossarum and 16.3-degrees-C for G. roeseli. Interspecific differences were highly significant. 6. Theoretical lifetime potential fecundity was approximately 194 eggs for G. fossarum and 333 eggs for G. roeseli. The theoretical annual reproductive potential of single 'average' females was calculated for characteristic types of (a) summer-cold, (b) summer-cool and (c) summer-warm streams and rivers. The respective numbers of offspring for G. fossarum and G. roeseli were: (a) fifty-two and thirty-two, (b) 138 and 116, (c) 384 and 1277. These data are in agreement with the distribution of these two Gammarus species in central European running-water systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,AUG,1993,30,1,,,,,73,91,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00790.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00790.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LU38100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This reaction is extremely important to the study of Ocean Acidification (OA) and is the critical technical driver in the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's (MBARI) Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment (FOCE) experiments. The deep water FOCE science experiments are conducted at depths beyond scuba diver reach and demand that a valid perturbation experiment operate at a stable yet naturally fluctuating lower pH condition and avoid large or rapid pH variation as well as incomplete reactions, when we expose an experimental region or sample. Therefore, the technical requirement is to create a CO2 source in situ that is stable and well controlled. After extensive research and experimentation MBARI has developed the ability to create an in situ source of CO2 enriched seawater (ESW) for distribution and subsequent use in an ocean acidification experiment. The system mates with FOCE, but can be used in conjunction with other CO2 experimental applications in deep water. The ESW system is completely standalone from FOCE. While the chemical changes induced by the addition of fossil fuel CO2 on the ocean are well known and easily predicted, the biological consequences are less clear and the subject of considerable debate. Experiments have been successfully carried out on land to investigate the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels in various areas around the globe but only limited work on CO2 impacts to ocean environmental systems have been carried out to date. With rising concern over the long-term reduction in ocean pH, there is a need for viable in situ techniques to carry out experiments on marine biological systems. Previous investigations have used aquaria that compromise these studies because of reduced ecological complexity and buffering capacity. Additionally, aquaria use tightly controlled experimental conditions such as temperature, artificial light, and water quality that do not represent the natural ocean variability. In order to study the future effects of ocean acidification, scientists and engineers at MBARI have developed a technique and apparatus for an in situ perturbation experiment, the FOCE experimental platform. At the time of this writing the FOCE system and associated ESW are attached to the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) cabled observatory. Engineering validation and tuning experiments using remote control and real time experimental feedback are underway. Additionally, an extensive instrumentation suite provides all of the necessary data for pH calculation and experimental control. The ESW is a separately deployed system that stores and distributes CO2 enriched seawater. It receives power and communications via an underwater mateable electrical tether. The CO2 enriched seawater is pumped into the FOCE sections from the ESW. This paper describes the design, development, and testing of the underwater ESW Distribution System as well as the software control algorithms as applied to FOCE.

The field was fertilized with manure every spring, in which according to the fertilizing value of manure, the following contents of total nitrogen passed into manure-fertilized fields in each year: 2008 - 169 kg ha(-1), 2009 - 168 kg ha(-1); 2010 169 kg ha(-1), 2011 - 169 kg ha(-1), 2012 - 170 kg ha(-1). Maize for cattle forage was grown in experimental fields. The soil of the research subject is sandy loam. In the layer 0-40 cm of the fertilized area, the humus content in the soil fluctuated from low (1.2 %) to high (4.9 %). The content of mineral nitrogen fluctuated from 14.2 to 289 kg ha(-1) what corresponded to the nitrogen content very low and very high respectively. The content of humus in non-fertilized soil fluctuated from the very low value (1 %) to moderate value (3 %). The content of mineral nitrogen fluctuated from 10.9 to 130 kg ha(-1), what corresponded to the nitrogen content very low and very high. For the purpose of chemical investigations, water samples from drainage were taken once per month. Water analyses were carried out by the accredited Chemical Analytical Laboratory of the Water Management Engineering Institute of Aleksandras Stulginskis University. N-total in drainage water was determined by applying the spectrometric method, by mineralizing with potassium persulphate. Soil samples for agrochemical investigations were taken monthly from the depth of 0-60 cm at every 20 cm. To identify the content of nitrogen in the soil, the following research methods were applied: ammonium nitrogen (N-NH4+) - colorimetric with Nessler's reagent in KCl extract; nitrate nitrogen (N-NO3-) - potentiometric with selective electrode. Analyses of N - NH4+ and N - NO3- were carried out by means of analyser FIA Star 5012. The composition of manure was identified from one extract prepared by burning with concentrated sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and selenium (Se) catalyst. Nitrogen was identified using Kjeldal method, by mineralizing with a mineralizator Digestor 2006 as well as distilling with a distiller Kjeltec System 1002 Distilling Unit. To determine the rainfall and air temperature, data from Dotnuva Meteorology Station were used. The aim of this research was to ascertain the impact of large livestock company fields fertilized annually with manure on the water quality in drainage. Investigation results have demonstrated that fields fertilized annually with manure raised the contents of N-min in the soil by 1.5 times respectively in comparison to the non-fertilized variant. The increase in these contents was conditioned by the higher air temperature and the lower rainfall. The seasonality of N-total concentrations in drainage water was discovered: higher concentrations were identified in autumn and winter, lower concentrations - in spring and summer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1822-3230,,,,,,2013,6,3,,,,,371,375,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000357670300066,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seedlings Exposed to Sulfuric and Nitric Acid Mist,SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"During the growing seasons of 1985-88, red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) seedlings were exposed repeatedly in field chambers to sulfuric and/or nitric acid mist in the range of pH 2.5 to 4.5. Hydrogen ion, sulfate, and nitrate concentrations in mist were within the range found in cloudwater of the northeastern USA where high-elevation spruce forests are declining. After the period of exposures, seedlings remained outdoors and buds were sampled in the autumn to determine effects of mist treatments on the number of developing needle primordia. Current-year foliage was sampled from autumn to spring for measurement of cold tolerance by freeze-induced electrolyte leakage (FIEL) and buds were scored for degree of bud break in the early spring. In the 1985-87 experiments when 16-hour overnight mist events were continuous, there were few statistically significant effects of acidic mist on needle primodia development, foliar FIEL, and bud-break. However, in the 1988 experiment when 16-hour overnight mist events were intermittent rather than continuous and acidities fluctuated among events, sulfuric acid mist decreased the number of needle primordia in September and October relative to the other treatments. Acidity of mist increased FIEL in October. Sulfate and nitrate content of mist appeared to influence these effects of acidity on FIEL differently depending on level of cold tolerance and duration of time since the period of exposures to mist. Bud-break in May was not significantly affected by prior mist treatments. Responses to acidic mist were similar among provenances that were obtained from different locations in the northeastern USA, although provenances differed in phenological development and FIEL. Mist deposition to the soil medium was minimized or avoided in these experiments; therefore, we conclude that foliar FIEL of red spruce seedlings is vulnerable to effects of direct contact of acidic mist with foliage. To relate results of these controlled experiments to cloudwater and decline of red spruce trees in the northern Appalachian mountains, the following information is needed: the frequency of wet-dry cycles in the forest; fluctuations in acidity and sulfate and nitrate concentrations among and within cloudwater events; the specific patterns of temperature changes that lead to winter injury; and the relationship between FIEL and freezing damage to foliage for both seedlings and mature trees.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0282-7581,,,,,,1992,7,1-4,,,,,331,344,,10.1080/02827589209382726,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02827589209382726,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000208272600033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two laboratory experiments and 2 field observations were conducted to clarify the factors affecting the occurrence of EMMs. The first experiment showed that EMMs needed to grow fast until the breeding season and began producing sperm at about 14 mm carapace length. Individuals with an AMP (length of the endopod/length of the appendix masculina) value above 40 were defined as EMMs. In the second experiment, the effects of food amount, hatching date and maternal size on growth at Age-0 were examined. Food amount strongly affected the early growth. A difference in hatching date of >2 wk caused a large difference in body size of juveniles; this difference was maintained until the breeding season 3 mo later. Large females spawned larger larvae than small females, but the size difference between larvae from large females and those from small females decreased with time. Field observations showed that at one site in Saroma Lagoon, Hokkaido, Japan, hatching occurred over a 1 mo period. In 1996/1997, we found no obvious differences of size distribution of Age-0 individuals and the occurrence of EMM as a function of location in the lagoon or year. These results may have been caused by slow growth, because water temperatures in the lagoon were much colder in 1996/1997 than during 1987 to 1995. We conclude that the occurrence of EMMs is closely related to various environmental factors in shallow waters. Therefore, the proportion of EMMs may fluctuate both locally and annually. This study shows that a small difference in juvenile growth over a short period can alter the subsequent life history of P. latirostris.",,,,,"Chiba, Susumu/D-1697-2017","Chiba, Susumu/0000-0003-1545-1552",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,2000,203,,,,,,215,224,,10.3354/meps203215,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps203215,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000089661100017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Scallops growth and reproduction were monitored weekly over a 7-month period under two conditions (culture depths): on the bottom and 2 m above (suspended culture). At the same time, a high-frequency environmental monitoring was realized at the aforementioned depths. The results indicate that environmental conditions in the Bay are highly variable, especially during the summer: temperature fluctuations up to 8 degrees C were recorded in less than one day while oxic conditions ranged from oversaturation to anoxia. Milky-turquoise waters discoloration events (sulphide presence suspected) were simultaneously observed together with anoxic conditions and sudden temperature drops. Increased stratification and upwelling favorable winds during the summer might be partly responsible for the observed environmental variability. Higher somatic and gonadal growth were observed in scallops growing in suspended culture compare with bottom culture. This pattern might be related to different environmental conditions at culture depth: turbidity was lower in suspended culture and hypoxic conditions occurred only 18% of the whole study period versus 48% on the bottom. The Gonadosomatic index varied according to an approx. 30-day cycle between winter and late spring and it was synchronous between the different scallop size groups. During summer, when milky waters and anoxic events occurred frequently, cessation of reproduction, somatic weight losses and increased scallop mortality were observed. Exposure to severe hypoxia and related environmental conditions clearly affected scallop bioenergetics and subsequently growth and reproduction. In addition, the occurrence of milky waters harmed the survival of the Peruvian scallop in culture.

The timing of oscillations in rivers, however, lags behind those of temperature and evapotranspiration in hill-slopes. Two hypotheses have been put forth to explain the magnitude and timing of diel streamflow oscillations during low-flow conditions. The first suggests that delays between the peaks and troughs of streamflow and daily evapotranspiration are due to processes occurring in the soil as water moves toward the channels in the river network. The second posits that they are due to the propagation of the signal through the channels as water makes its way to the outlet of the basin. In this paper, we design and implement a theoretical model to test these hypotheses. We impose a baseflow signal entering the river network and use a linear transport equation to represent flow along the network. We develop analytic streamflow solutions for the case of uniform velocities in space over all river links. We then use our analytic solution to simulate streamflows along a self-similar river network for different flow velocities. Our results show that the amplitude and time delay of the streamflow solution are heavily influenced by transport in the river network. Moreover, our equations show that the geomorphology and topology of the river network play important roles in determining how amplitude and signal delay are reflected in streamflow signals. Finally, we have tested our theoretical formulation in the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed, where oscillations are clearly observed in streamflow records. We find that our solution produces streamflow values and fluctuations that are similar to those observed in the summer of 2011.",,,,,"Mantilla, Ricardo/B-9658-2008","Mantilla, Ricardo/0000-0002-2957-6252; Fonley, Morgan/0000-0003-3387-0240",,,,,,,,,,,,,1027-5606,1607-7938,,,,,2016,20,7,,,,,2899,2912,,10.5194/hess-20-2899-2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2899-2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000381101700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

These changes significantly influence hydrologic and erosion processes. Experimental data are necessary to improve the understanding and modeling of the phenomenon. Laboratory experiments were conducted in Beijing to assess the impacts of thawed soil depth, slope gradient, and flow rate on soil erosion by concentrated meltwater flow over an underlying frozen soil layer. Soil samples from watershed were filled in flumes, saturated before being frozen. After the soil was completely frozen, flumes were taken out of storage to thaw the frozen soil from top to the designed depths. Meltwater flow was simulated using a tank filled with water and icecubes at approximately 0 degrees C. The erosion experiments involved four thawed soil depths of 1, 2, 5, and 10cm; three slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees; and three flow rates of 1, 2, and 4l/min; and seven rill lengths of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6m. Sediment-laden water samples were collected at the lower end of the flume for determination of sediment concentration. The results showed that sediment concentration increased exponentially with rill length to approach a maximum value. The sediment concentrations were closely correlated with thawed soil depth, flow rate, and slope gradient. Shallower thawed depths delivered more sediments than deeper thawed depths. Slope gradient was the primary factor responsible for severe erosion. The effect of flow rate on sediment concentration which decreased with increasing slope gradient, was not as significant as that of slope gradient. Results from these experiments are useful for understanding the effect of thawed soil depth on erosion process in thawed soils subject to freezing and for estimating erosion model parameters.

Extraordinarily early drying events in shallow ponds and wetlands at our study sites prompted us to conduct 2 mesocosm experiments to document how proximate cues of drying modify agonistic behaviors among larvae of the caddisfly, Asynarchus nigriculus. Larvae are mainly detritivores but can be extremely aggressive and engage in mob cannibalism, perhaps to obtain a dietary supplement that hastens escape from drying basins. In one experiment, we manipulated caddisfly density to simulate the effects of crowding during pond drying. In a 2nd experiment, we reduced water levels and manipulated a protein supplement that mimics the dietary benefits of cannibalism. We quantified the effects of those manipulations on aggressive behaviors that are precursors to cannibalism and on development time to pupation. Frequency and duration of agonistic encounters increased as a function of larval density and, independent of density, were higher in drying than nondrying treatments, especially in the absence of a protein supplement. Pupation occurred earlier in high- than low-density treatments and earlier with than without a protein supplement. In contrast, the timing of pupation was not accelerated in drying compared with nondrying treatments, which might reflect the extreme diel temperature fluctuations in drying ponds, hence suboptimal growth conditions. Our findings provide evidence that declining water levels and crowding serve as cues that enable caddisflies to adjust behavior and development in the face of habitat drying. Early drying events observed in recent years may exceed the limits of this flexibility and portend the demise of populations in temporary habitats that historically supported this species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2161-9549,2161-9565,,,,JUN,2016,35,2,,,,,619,630,,10.1086/685583,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/685583,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000376471600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The recent development of permanent, multi-sensor seafloor observatories in deep-water environments provides opportunities for the in situ investigation of the behaviour of benthic organisms in relation to habitat variability. This paper describes a multi-disciplinary investigation at the VENUS observatory platform in Saanich Inlet, an intermittently anoxic fjord (Vancouver Island, Canada). A remotely operated digital camera (103 m depth) was used to document changes in the abundance of shrimp (Spirontocaris spp.) and the squat lobster (Munida quadrispina), as well as bacterial mat coverage (Beggiatoa spp.). These data were used as proxies of diel rhythms related to day-night and internal tidal cycles. Seafloor photos were acquired hourly during consecutive days, before, during and after oxygen intrusion events in the fall of 2009. In order to relate biological fluctuations to habitat cycles, bottom water pressure, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate data were also acquired from the observatory database. Periodogram analysis showed a weak internal-tide-associated rhythmicity for Spirontocaris spp. that was absent in M. quadrispina and in bacterial mat coverage. Waveform analysis confirmed the absence of any day-night fluctuation in all tested species. However, a rapid intrusion of oxygenated water at the study site influenced visual counts of species, possibly blurring detectable activity rhythms. Temperature and nitrate fluctuations were more accentuated during spring tides but cross-correlation analysis indicated an absence of species responses to these habitat variables. Results are discussed within the context of the complex oceanographic dynamics of Saanich Inlet and with respect to understanding the ecological consequences of expanding hypoxia in the global ocean.

The distribution of species living in an estuary is largely determined by how well they can cope with such fluctuations. The spionid polychaete Pygospio elegans is common in boreal estuarine habitats that show strong salinity fluctuations, living in habitats ranging from fully marine salinities to brackish environments with salinities as low as 5. In this study we investigated the abilities of P. elegans to cope with an acute as well as a long-term change in salinity. Specimens originating from a salinity of about 15 were exposed to salinity 15 as control and 5 and 30 as low and high salinity treatments. In acute exposure experiments, we measured body volume and tissue water content as well as gene expression of seven genes related to volume- and osmoregulation within 4 h of exposure. In a long-term experiment, we monitored survival, growth and reproduction as well as potential changes in DNA methylation within 6 weeks after a gradual salinity change. In response to abrupt exposure to a hyposmotic medium (salinity 5) we observed increased body volume that could not be fully restored, increased mortality, and no clear change in gene expression. Hence, P. elegans might be a weak cell-volume regulator that cannot cope well with sudden drops in salinity. In contrast, a gradual, long-term change in salinity seemed to be less stressful, although worms at salinity 5 showed slightly increased mortality and reduced or delayed maturity. Overall, there were fewer detrimental effects of exposure to a higher salinity.

Selection from standing variation has been suggested to be more efficient than acquiring new mutations. Yet, studies on community trait composition and trait selection largely focus on phenotypic variation in ecological traits, whereas the underlying genomic traits remain understudied. Using a genome-explicit, niche- and individual-based model, we address the potential interactions between genomic and ecological traits shaping communities under an environmental selective forcing, namely temporal positively autocorrelated environmental fluctuation. In this model, all ecological traits are explicitly coded by the genome. For our experiments, we initialized 90 replicate communities, each with ca 350 initial species, characterized by random genomic and ecological trait combinations, on a 2D spatially explicit landscape with two orthogonal gradients (temperature and resource use). We exposed each community to two contrasting scenarios: without (i.e. static environments) and with temporal variation. We then analyzed emerging compositions of both genomic and ecological traits at the community, population and genomic levels. Communities in variable environments were species poorer than in static environments, and populations more abundant, whereas genomes had lower genetic linkage, mean genetic variation and a non-significant tendency towards higher numbers of genes. The surviving genomes (i.e. those selected by variable environments) coded for enhanced environmental tolerance and smaller biomass, which resulted in faster life cycles and thus also in increased potential for evolutionary rescue. Under temporal environmental variation, larger, less linked genomes retained more variation in mean dispersal ability at the population level than at genomic level, whereas the opposite trend emerged for biomass. Our results provide clues to how sexually-reproducing diploid plant communities might react to variable environments and highlights the importance of genomic traits and their interaction with ecological traits for eco-evolutionary responses to changing climates.",,,,,"Sarmento Cabral, Juliano/K-3973-2012","Sarmento Cabral, Juliano/0000-0002-0116-220X; Leidinger, Ludwig/0000-0002-5008-683X; Vedder, Daniel/0000-0002-0386-9102",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,JUL,2021,130,7,,,,,1100,1115,,10.1111/oik.08172,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.08172,,MAY 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000647857800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding the causes of recruitment variability remains elusive because factors that affect the growth and survivorship of young fishes are complex and dynamic. Here we focus on the influence of salinity on growth of early juvenile Atlantic croaker, Micropogonias undulatus under laboratory conditions as part of a larger study to relate short-term fluctuations in growth rates of young estuarine-dependent fishes with variability in abiotic environmental factors. Body growth of juvenile Atlantic croaker was significantly (P < 0.001) different among all of the three salinity treatments with growth in 5 parts per thousand > 20-5 parts per thousand = 20 parts per thousand. A Linear response to the changing treatment suggests an additive effect of changing salinity on body wet weight (WW) growth. Juvenile Atlantic croaker in the 5 parts per thousand treatment grew in WW by a factor of 3.88 relative to initial WW. Fish in the 20-5 parts per thousand treatment grew in WW by a factor of 2.90, while fish in the 20 parts per thousand treatment grew in WW by a factor of 2.17. Otolith diameter also varied significantly with salinity, and there was a significant positive relationship between changes in body WW and changes in otolith diameter growth (r = 0.68, P < 0.02, n = 12). The correlation between body and otolith growth justified our use of otolith data to infer that substantial fluctuation in the early growth of early juvenile Atlantic croaker from field collections was inversely cross-correlated with salinity and water temperature. Assuming that the probability of survival during the nursery period increases as postlarval fish grow, salinity-induced plasticity in growth rates implies that the site and habitat into which post-larval fish settle can potentially influence recruitment dynamics. This study demonstrates that there is the potential for fluctuations and spatial variability in salinity to cause significant variability in short-term growth rates for juvenile fishes within estuarine nursery areas.

Using hundreds of surveys in the JZB and the adjacent Yellow Sea (YS), we examined the population fluctuations over the recent 20 years, possible links between abundance and environmental factors, and the reproductive strategies. In the JZB, P. globosa mainly appeared from August to December each year, reaching the maximum abundance of 170 ind. m(-3) in August 2008. A general warming trend continues in the JZB during the recent two decades, with the alternating of warm and cool periods. Temperature is recognized as a primary driver of abundance variations, with significantly higher abundance levels in warmer years than in cooler years. The population uses either larval reproduction or adult reproduction almost exclusively in the JZB, with unknown mechanisms. High abundance can result from both reproductive strategies. Larval reproduction distinguishes itself from adult reproduction by significantly smaller parent size, egg size and clutch size, explaining the short-size dominated population in several surveys. Clutch size is positively related to body size and temperature. The geographical range of the YS population reached to similar to 39 degrees N in June 2014, indicating a northward expansion since the late 1990s, together with other evidences from the JZB and the Bohai Sea. While the successful establishment could be driven primarily by warming, lack of competitors and predators as well as the particular life history strategies also contributed.

This variability was monitored together with physico-chemical variables affecting carbon availability, photosynthesis, and growth. The environmental variables, such as light, temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen, alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and CO2, displayed not only an expected seasonal cycle but also a daily (tidal) variability, with abrupt and rapid changes influenced by biological activities, physical variables, tidal state and tidal timing. In contrast to environmental variables, photosynthesis, pigments and C:N composition were affected by seasonal changes but not by tidal regimes, as organisms integrated these short-term fluctuations in physico-chemical variables. Photosynthesis, pigments and internal N composition were maximal in autumn and minimal in summer for both species. Growth showed a seasonal trend, displaying a summer drop with negative values. This response can be the result of extreme values of environmental variables (temperature, light, pH, nutrients, and the shortage of DIC) in summer, in comparison with higher growth rates in September onwards. The use of inhibitors of carbon acquisition in situ at normal DIC concentrations (2.2. mM) revealed species-dependent differences. While the external carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity showed a constitutive character in G. longissima, it showed little effect in E. intestinalis, which relies on internal CA activity. The 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS)-sensitive bicarbonate transport in G. longissima was effective in winter. In contrast, DIDS stimulated photosynthesis in summer, and relieved AZ inhibition. This response could suggest a stimulation of a H+ extrusion mediated-CO2 transport in periods of low CO2 availability. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The first two loci are associated with the vernalization response and the latter two with photoperiod sensitivity. The 'Dicktoo'x'Kompolti korai' (winter) population (DK) has a known functional polymorphism only at VRN-H2, a locus associated with vernalization sensitivity. Flowering time in both populations was accelerated when there was no fluctuating factor in the environment and was delayed to the greatest extent with the application of synchronous photo and thermo cycles. Alleles at VRN-H1, VRN-H2, PPD-H1, and PPD-H2-and their interactions-were found to be significant determinants of the increase/decrease in days to flower.

'Houseui' Japanese pear trees exposed to thermal fluctuations were left to accumulate 600 chilling hours (CH) in order to simulate mild winter conditions and subsequently moved into a greenhouse to observe bud burst and number of flowers/cluster. During endodormancy progression, the concentration of sugars, starch and alpha-amylase activity were analyzed in lateral flower buds and stems collected at 0, 300 and 600 CH. In addition, necrosis of floral primordia was examined in buds collected over the, same period. Thermal fluctuations during endodormancy caused floral primordia necrosis at 300 CH and 600 CH and tended to decrease bud burst percentages. Low concentrations of soluble sugars were observed in buds and stems subjected to thermal fluctuations during endodormancy. Lower percentage of bud burst and incidence of floral primordia necrosis may be a result of low sucrose observed in buds. Hexoses and sorbitol that are important for energy and carbon supply as well freeze tolerance during endodormancy were lower in buds and stem exposed to thermal fluctuations. Thermal fluctuations inhibited the activity of alpha-amylase in buds and retarded the degradation of starch, leading to low accumulation of soluble sugars during endodormancy.

So far, few studies have been focused on the comparison of photosynthetic induction between tetraploid and diploid rice. Here, we for the first time compared the leaf photosynthetic induction and the underlying mechanism between tetraploid and diploid rice. After polyploidization, the plants displayed a larger size and lower density of stomata, which resulted in slower stomatal opening in response to a stepwise increase in light intensity. Further analysis indicated that stomatal opening, instead of biochemical processes, is the most important factor that contributes to the difference in photosynthetic induction between tetraploid and diploid rice. With lower stomatal conductance (g(s)), tetraploid rice displayed a lower intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i), and therefore lower photosynthetic efficiency during light induction. However, we observed a higher intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) in tetraploid rice than in diploid rice, which may contribute to the survival and growth of plants under water limiting conditions. This study highlights the function of stomata in regulating photosynthetic induction and water use efficiency under fluctuating light, which will help the improvement of crop photosynthetic efficiency in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0098-8472,1873-7307,,,,FEB,2022,194,,,,,,,,104757,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.104757,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.104757,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000760269600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Long meteorological records represent an essential tool to properly characterize climate fluctuations from decadal to multi-decadal scales. Unfortunately, the scarcity of continuous and homogeneous instrumental records is a major constraint to determine long-term variations in South America. Our knowledge of the forcings modulating the hydrological variability in mountains is still limited, despite their importance as freshwater sources for people living in the adjacent piedmonts and lowlands. The objective of this work is to determine the spatial-temporal variability of precipitation in the humid subtropical Andes and the Chaco region in North Western Argentina (NWA). Thirty-four rainfall records covering the common period 1934-1990, partially updated to 2016, were used to extend and identify the dominant patterns of seasonal to annual hydroclimatic variability based on principal components analysis. Intensity and frequency of droughts and pluvials (<5th and >95th percentiles, respectively) were determined for the dominant patterns of variability. Our results show a positive trend in precipitation since 1970s in all temporal patterns and sub-regions. In addition, precipitation variability (both positive and negative extremes) increases during these last decades. Correlation analysis with sea-surface temperatures and wind anomalies during summer, reveal Amazon moisture sources and large-scale oceanic controls on NWA precipitation. The extended precipitation series shows that the frequency of pluvials has increased since the 1970s interrupted by few extreme droughts.

Irregular and reduced precipitation, especially in the form of snow, is assumed to dictate poor flowering and enhanced injury to catkins, especially in the sourced cultivars of interest to growers. We investigated the effect of water (precipitation received as rain and or snow) percolation during snowmelt period using phenological endpoints such as female flower ratio, bud position of female flower occurrence, and catkin dehiscence in sourced and locally adapted cultivars. These reproductive events were also analyzed for biochemical endpoints such as the concentrations of tryptophan, serotonin and melatonin in temporally collected bud or catkin samples. In addition, the yield responses of the tagged twigs were tracked and analyzed. When snow was consistently removed from the root zone (NS) or when a prior placed plastic sheet (P) disallowed water percolation, the percentage of female flowers and apical dominance declined in the sourced cultivars suggesting an erratic gradient between aerial and belowground temperature. The presence of snow cover resulted in increased probability of female flowers from dormant buds in sourced cultivars. Tryptophan was found to accumulate in the dormant buds of sourced cultivars where snow was not disturbed, while serotonin concentrations were significantly higher in NS and P treatments. Melatonin concentrations were notably high in dormant flower and vegetative buds of locally adapted cultivars especially subjected to P treatment. The biochemical markers may not only assist in identifying cold tolerance but also reveal abiotic stress negating responses modulated by relative concentrations of these molecules. Our results demonstrate that ideal conditions of good precipitation, especially as snow, would not only blanket to provide thermoregulation but also maintain the sensitive gradient on which temperate trees rely to break dormancy and initiate flower development.

We applied the models at regional scale where we quantified the impact of various groundwater salinity levels on grass growth and production using historical weather data (1971-2000). The salt concentrations in the subsoil were derived from the National Hydrological Instrument. The results show that salinity effects on grass production are limited. In wet years the excess rainfall will infiltrate the soil and reduce salt water seepage. In a next step we used future weather data for the year 2050, derived from 3 Global Circulation Models. From each model we used data from two CO2 emission scenarios. As expected higher temperatures increased drought stress, however, the production reduction as a result of salt water in the root zone is limited. Salt stress mainly occurred when irrigation was applied with saline water. The increased CO2 concentration in combination with the limited drought stress resulted in increasing simulated actual and potential yields. Overall conclusion for grassland in The Netherlands: drought stress is stronger than stress caused by water excess which on its turn is stronger than salinity stress. Future water demand for irrigation may increase by 11-19% and result in water scarcity if water supply is insufficient. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Similarly, polymers in living fluids such as bacterial suspensions and swarms suffer bending deformations as they interact with single bacteria or with cell clusters.

Here, we examine the mechanical properties-under tension-of such constrained active filaments under canonical boundary conditions motivated by experiments. Fluctuations in the filament shape are a consequence of two types of random forces-thermal Brownian forces and activity derived forces with specified time and space correlation functions. We derive force-extension relationships and expressions for the mean square deflections for tethered filaments under various boundary conditions including hinged and clamped constraints. The expressions for hinged-hinged boundary conditions are reminiscent of the worm-like-chain model and feature effective bending moduli and mode-dependent non-thermodynamic effective temperatures controlled by the imposed force and by the activity.

(Hemerocallidaceae),INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"The ornamental daylily, Hemerocallis fulva (Hemerocallidaceae), possesses a short, vertically oriented basal shoot packed with a circle of root tubers that are exhausted during sprouting after dormancy. During the growth period a new circle of root tubers is formed, enabling the plant to survive the next resting phase. In shallow-planted individuals the new root circle appears just above the old one. The new root tubers show strong contractile activity and pull the cryptocorm downward. Deep-planted cryptocorms of H. fulva move upward by the growing shoot tip. During the sprouting process, a few internodes of the deeply located shoot tip elongate, and thus the new root circle appears at a distance of several centimeters from the old root circle. However, this shoot elongation only appears when the individual is positioned very deeply in the soil (facultative shoot elongation). Induction experiments make clear that the parameters (light, temperature fluctuations) that normally influence the activity of contractile roots cannot regulate root contraction in H. fulva. Contraction is a basic characteristic of H. fulva roots and always functions to pull down the vertical shoot. However, individuals of H. fulva are well adapted to secure the best soil position for survival by having two mechanisms to regulate soil depth: the pulling effect of contractile roots, and, as an emergency response, the opposite effect of upward growth of the facultative shoot elongation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1058-5893,,,,,JAN,1998,159,1,,,,,23,30,,10.1086/297517,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/297517,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000072688100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, it is difficult to mechanistically associate 30-yr climate norms to dynamic processes involved in species range shifts (e.g. seedling survival). What are the consequences of temporal aggregation for estimating areas of potential establishment? We modeled seedling survival for three widespread tree species in California, USA (Quercus douglasii, Q. kelloggii, Pinus sabiniana) by coupling a large-scale, multi-year common garden experiment to high-resolution downscaled grids of climatic water deficit and air temperature (Flint and Flint 2012, Supplementary material Appendix 1). We projected seedling survival for nine climate change projections in two mountain landscapes spanning wide elevation and moisture gradients. We compared areas with windows of opportunity for seedling survival -defined as three consecutive years of seedling survival in our species, a period selected based on studies of tree niche ontogeny (Supplementary material Appendix 1) - to areas of 30-yr averaged estimates of seedling survival.

All inoculation tests were made under conditions that approximate the greenhouse conditions for butterhead lettuce cultivation in Flanders (Belgium). The survival and proliferation of the pathogens on the leaves was determined at days 0, 4, and 8 after inoculation using standard plating techniques on selective medium. In the growth chamber, the extent to which both pathogens were able to multiply on the lettuce leaves was influenced by crop stage and leaf age. On young plants, the older leaves supported pathogen survival better. On nearly mature plants, pathogen population sizes were significantly higher on the old and young leaves compared with middle-aged leaves (p < 0.001). In the greenhouse, the environmental regimen with high fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity was less conducive to the survival of E. coli O157, though its survival on nearly mature lettuce was enhanced by overhead irrigation. The moist conditions between the folded inner leaves are likely contributing to the survival of enteric pathogens in the lettuce head.

Methods Our experimental treatments, operated through an automated system, included: (i) reduced and (ii) increased rainfall amount by 50%, (iii) reduced rainfall frequency but no change in amount (i.e., more extreme downpours), (iv) and an extreme summer drought. Results Temporal dynamics of ecosystem-level CO2 fluxes fluctuated seasonally and were driven by variations in soil water availability, soil temperature and photosynthetically active radiation. Reducing the frequency of rainfall events, but without change in the amount of rainfall, resulted in lower ecosystem-level net CO2 uptake due to relatively greater R-eco stimulation after the heavy downpours, particularly during the late summer season. The extreme summer drought downregulated both respiration and photosynthesis. Microbial abundance and activity did not change in response to rainfall manipulation and were not strongly related to precipitation-driven changes in C cycling. In contrast, a greater proportion of live to dead plant biomass, in turn driven by greater water availability, was a main driver of greater respiration and photosynthesis.

The species, sharing the same availability of light and nutrient resource, are characterized by different photo-physiological parameters. The spatial and temporal evolution of turbulent mixing is simulated introducing vertical profiles of measured eddy diffusivity. Three case studies have been examined to analyze the role of environment-individual interactions in determining bloom conditions for both the selected species. The organisms experience recurrent fluctuations of light, temperature, and nutrient concentration gradients, due to the turbulent mixing in the water column, which have significant effects on the growth of the phytoplankton species. In all the numerical experiments, the temporal and spatial variability of different forcings do not support the prevalence of one species over the other over the time scale typical of a phytoplankton bloom.

This adaptation is presumably a behavioural adaptation to strong seasonal fluctuation in prey availability, day length and temperature. Yet so far, insight into the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms involved has remained elusive. In the present study, the overwintering behaviour is considered to be a strategy requiring 2 annual decisions: When to end overwintering and when to start overwintering, which combined comprise the timing and duration of the foraging window. We present a model framework for sandeel that demonstrates how the optimal timing of the foraging window involves a trade-off between energy gain and survival probability. Physiological components of the model are based on laboratory experiments with sandeel, some of which are presented as part of this study. The major findings were that optimisation of individual fitness is strictly dependent on the temporal match between the foraging window and the peak period of the spring burst of zooplankton. In contrast, fitness is only marginally reduced in individuals that fail to optimise the foraging window in relation to the level of mortality and prey availability experienced during the zooplankton spring burst. Lastly, overwintering remained the optimal strategy, even in scenarios where winter prey abundances approached abundances near that of the peak abundance in spring.",,,,,,"van Deurs, Mikael/0000-0003-2368-2502; Christensen, Asbjorn/0000-0002-4286-7409; Mosegaard, Henrik/0000-0001-7045-9456",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,2010,416,,,,,,201,U215,,10.3354/meps08763,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps08763,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000283446400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among these are brain function and behavior, including social behavior. Although usually neglected, few studies have already demonstrated that even trivial factors, such as features of the holding water may alter zebrafish behavior. In this study, we employed a 2x2 between-subject experimental design, exposing zebrafish to water of either high or low salinity and with chemosensory/olfactory cues of conspecifics either present or absent (while maintaining pH, temperature, nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia levels constant). We presented moving images of conspecifics to experimental zebrafish and analyzed their behavioral responses using video tracking. We found significant interaction between salinity and olfactory cues. For example, zebrafish exposed to their home tank water (high salinity with chemosensory/olfactory cues present) stayed significantly closer to the bottom of their tank compared with fish exposed to the other water conditions, and fish exposed to water with chemosensory/olfactory cues significantly reduced their turns compared with fish exposed to water without chemosensory/olfactory cues. These differences signify the impact environmental factors, for example, fluctuations in salinity level and presence or absence of chemosensory/olfactory cues, may have on zebrafish behavior. We conclude that maintaining stable environmental conditions and specifying and reporting them precisely are important for reducing error variation and for making results across independent studies more comparable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1545-8547,1557-8542,,,,OCT,2017,14,5,,,,,444,458,,10.1089/zeb.2017.1472,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/zeb.2017.1472,,,,,,,,28873052,,,,,WOS:000412338600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

PM2.5 showed a weaker correlation than the bigger particles with both the circulation patterns and the parameters' fluctuations. Temporal pollutants variations were clearly governed by the emissions patterns while the low wind speed was not necessarily a good indicator of high concentration levels.

Emergence was monitored from an artificial seed bank in 2004 and a natural seed bank in 2005. Overall, common cocklebur emerged from early May through late October and presented multiple emergence. In no-till plots with or without soybean, initial emergence was delayed 7 d in both years. In TNS plots, major emergence (daily emergence > mean emergence plus standard deviation) of common cocklebur occurred from early May to late July. In NTNS plots, major emergence occurred from late May through late August. No-till reduced total common cocklebur emergence by 59 to 69% compared with tillage. At the V5 to V6 soybean growth stage, the daily soil thermal fluctuation at 2.5 cm soil depth diminished from approximately 15 to 5 C and reduced common cocklebur emergence by 84 to 91% for the rest of the growing season. Common cocklebur emergence was higher when the mean soil temperature was > 15 C, and the daily thermal fluctuation was > 7.5 C.

Remote sensing technologies are an ideal choice for achieving this goal. This study addresses the feasibility of estimating MLDs from optical properties. These properties are strongly influenced by suspended particle concentrations, which generally reach a maximum at pycnoclines. The premise therefore is to use a gradient in beam attenuation at 660 nm (c660) as a proxy for the depth of a particle-scattering layer. Using a global data set collected during World Ocean Circulation Experiment cruises from 1988-1997, six algorithms were employed to compute MLDs from either density or temperature profiles. Given the absence of published optically based MLD algorithms, two new methods were developed that use c660 profiles to estimate the MLD. Intercomparison of the six hydrographically based algorithms revealed some significant disparities among the resulting MLD values. Comparisons between the hydrographical and optical approaches indicated a first-order agreement between the MLDs based on the depths of gradient maxima for density and c660. When comparing various hydrographically based algorithms, other investigators reported that inherent fluctuations of the mixed layer depth limit the accuracy of its determination to 20 m.

Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in eastern North America re-colonize the breeding range over several generations that result in population densities that vary across space and time during the breeding season. We used laboratory experiments to measure the strength of density-dependent intraspecific competition on egg laying rate and larval survival and then applied our results to density estimates of wild monarch populations to model the strength of density dependence during the breeding season. Egg laying rates did not change with density but larvae at high densities were smaller, had lower survival, and weighed less as adults compared to lower densities. Using mean larval densities from field surveys resulted in conservative estimates of density-dependent population reduction that varied between breeding regions and different phases of the breeding season. Our results suggest the highest levels of population reduction due to density-dependent intraspecific competition occur early in the breeding season in the southern portion of the breeding range. However, we also found that the strength of density dependence could be almost five times higher depending on how many life-stages were used as part of field estimates. Our study is the first to link experimental results of a density-dependent reduction in vital rates to observed monarch densities in the wild and show that the effects of density dependent competition in monarchs varies across space and time, providing valuable information for developing robust, year-round population models in this migratory organism.",,,,,"Flockhart, D.

While it is commonly agreed that both events are associated with equatorial and subsequent coastal-trapped wave propagations driven remotely by a relaxation of the trade-winds, it is surprising that SST anomalies off Angola tend to precede the ones in the eastern-equatorial sector by similar to 1 month. To explain this counterintuitive behavior, our methodology is based on the experimentation with a Tropical Atlantic Ocean model. Using idealized wind-stress perturbations from a composite analysis, we trigger warm equatorial and coastal events over a stationary and then, seasonally varying ocean mean-state. In agreement with the linear dynamics, our results show that when the interannual wind-stress forcing is restricted to the western-central equatorial Atlantic, the model yields equatorial events leading the coastal ones. This implies that neither the differences in the ocean stratification between the two regions (thermocline depths or modal wave contributions) nor the seasonal phasing of the events explains the observed temporal sequence. Only if wind-stress anomalies are also prescribed in the coastal fringe, the coastal warming precedes the eastern-equatorial SST anomaly peak, emphasizing the role of the local forcing in the phenology of Benguela Ninos. A weaker South-Atlantic Anticyclone initiates the coastal warming before the development of eastern-equatorial SST anomalies. Then, equatorward coastal wind anomalies, driven by a convergent anomalous circulation located on the warm Atlantic Nino, stop the remotely forced coastal warming prematurely. Plain Language Summary We investigate the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) interannual fluctuations in the Tropical Atlantic. We focus on the extreme warm events that occur every few years in the Gulf of Guinea, the Atlantic Ninos, and along the coast of Angola-Namibia, the Benguela Ninos. It is commonly agreed that both events are forced by equatorial and subsequent coastal waves triggered in the western-central basin by a relaxation of the trade-winds. Yet, we observe that the coastal warming tends to precede the one in the Gulf of Guinea by similar to 1 month. We explain this counterintuitive fact, using experimentation with a Tropical Atlantic Ocean model. Using idealized wind-stress perturbations, we simulate warm equatorial and coastal events on top of a stationary and then, seasonally varying ocean mean-state. Results show that when wind-stress perturbations are confined to the western-central equatorial Atlantic, the model yields equatorial events leading the coastal variability, consistent with the propagation path of the waves. This implies that neither the ocean mean-state nor its seasonal variability controls the timing between events. We further show that only when wind-stress anomalies are prescribed within the coastal fringe, warm events off Angola precede the eastern-equatorial SST anomaly. Both warmings originate from a reduction of the strength of the South-Atlantic Anticyclone. Nevertheless, local processes initiate the coastal warming before the remotely forced equatorial waves impact the eastern-equatorial SST. Benguela Ninos then also stop earlier due to the development of coastal wind anomalies associated with a convergent anomalous circulation located on the warm Atlantic Nino event.",,,,,"Luebbecke, Joke/AFR-7882-2022; Lübbecke, Joke F/G-6315-2016; Illig, Serena/F-5058-2018","Luebbecke, Joke/0000-0002-7839-3284; Lübbecke, Joke F/0000-0002-7839-3284; Illig, Serena/0000-0001-5490-3326; Bachelery, Marielou/0000-0002-5335-2267",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,SEP,2020,125,9,,,,,,,e2019JC016003,10.1029/2019JC016003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JC016003,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000576619900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

From August-September 1992 to February-March 1993, two Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Tropical Atmosphere Ocean moorings at 2 degrees S-156 degrees E (1739 m depth) and 2 degrees S-164.4 degrees E (4400 m depth) were outfitted with additional temperature, salinity, and pressure sensors to measure precisely the dynamic height from the surface to the bottom at 5-min intervals directly beneath two TOPEX/POSEIDON crossovers. Bottom pressure gauges and inverted echo sounders were deployed as well. A predeployment design study using full depth conductivity-temperature-depth casts, subsequently confirmed by postdeployment analyses, indicated this suite of instruments was capable of measuring sea surface height fluctuations to within 1-2 cm. The validation experiment also benefited from the comprehensive set of ocean-atmosphere measurements that were made in the region during the TOGA Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment intensive observation period of November 1992 to February 1993. The surface relative to bottom dynamic height fluctuations observed in situ during the 6-7 month experiment had a standard deviation of 5 cm with excursions of order +/- 15 cm. Energetic steric sea level variability was found to exist on short timescales of order hours to a few days, most notably, the quasi-permanence of strong semidiurnal internal tides. Such internal tides were noted to induce changes in surface dynamic height with a standard deviation of 2 dynamic centimeters. At the shallower of the two sites, 2 degrees S-156 degrees E, a possible nonlinear rectification of the internal tide was observed occasionally to change the dynamic height by as much as 30 cm over less than an hour. On timescales longer than the 10-day repeat of the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite, the low-frequency fluctuations of dynamic height were related to interannual variations corresponding to the 1991-1993 El Nino-Southern Oscillation, to the seasonal cycle, and to intraseasonal variations associated with the 40- to 60-day oscillations of the equatorial zonal wind field. Instantaneous comparisons between the 1-s TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter retrievals and the 5-min dynamic height were performed with regard to several tide models, the barotropic tide measured in situ, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts surface air pressure, and the surface air pressure measured in situ. Depending on the choice of altimeter and of the environmental corrections applied to the altimeter data, the rms differences between the satellite and the in situ measurements of sea level were as low as 3.3 cm at 2 degrees S-156 degrees E and 3.7 cm at 2 degrees S-164.4 degrees E. When additional satellite data in the general vicinity of the mooring are included and after the use of a 30-day low-pass filter, the satellite and in situ data were found to be highly correlated, with correlation coefficients of about 0.95 and rms differences around 1.8 cm.",,,,,"Gonzalez, Frank/ABG-8903-2021; Hackert, Eric/A-9915-2011; Gourdeau, lionel/J-7515-2017; McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016","Gourdeau, lionel/0000-0002-2078-3351; McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,DEC 15,1995,100,C12,,,,,25109,25127,,10.1029/95JC02128,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95JC02128,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995TL34100035,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this experiment was to examine the impact of natural vegetation restoration and long-term fertilization on the seasonal pattern of soil respiration and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from a black soil of northeast China. Soil respiration rate fluctuated greatly during the growing season in grassland (GL), ranging from 278 to 1030mg CO2 m-2h-1 with an average of 606mg CO2 m-2h-1. By contrast, soil CO2 emission did not change in bareland (BL) as much as in GL. For cropland (CL), including three treatments [CK (no fertilizer application), nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium application (NPK), and NPK together with organic manure (OM)], soil CO2 emission gradually increased with the growth of maize after seedling with an increasing order of CK NPM OM, reaching a maximum on 17 August and declining thereafter. A highly significant exponential correlation was observed between soil temperature and soil CO2 emission for GL during the late growing season (from 3 August to 28 September) with Q10 = 2.46, which accounted for approximately 75% of emission variability. However, no correlation was found between the two parameters for BL and CL. Seasonal CO2 emission from rhizosphere soil changed in line with the overall soil respiration, which averaged 184, 407, and 584mg CO2 m-2h-1, with peaks at 614, 1260, and 1770mg CO2 m-2h-1 for CK, NPK, and OM, respectively. SOM-derived CO2 emission of root free-soil, including basal soil respiration and plant residue-derived microbial decomposition, averaged 132, 132, and 136mg CO2 m-2h-1, respectively, showing no difference for the three CL treatments. Cumulative soil CO2 emissions decreased in the order OM GL NPK CK BL. The cumulative rhizosphere-derived CO2 emissions during the growing season of maize in cropland accounted for about 67, 74, and 80% of the overall CO2 emissions for CK, NPK, and OM, respectively. Cumulative CO2 emissions were found to significantly correlate with SOC stocks (r = 0.92, n = 5, P 0.05) as well as with SOC concentration (r = 0.97, n = 5, P 0.01). We concluded that natural vegetation restoration and long-term application of organic manure substantially increased C sequestration into soil rather than C losses for the black soil.

Fluctuations in hydrology affect soil redox potential, causing a shift in microbial metabolic pathways due to changes in nutrient and oxygen availability. We hypothesize that hydrologic variability influences microbial community composition. To evaluate the relationship between hydrology and bacterial community composition, we characterized soil redox potential and local soil factors along a hydrologic gradient at two floodplain wetland restoration sites. We collected soil samples along a gradient from upland to wetland, and monitored redox potential (in situ redox probes) and bacterial community composition (DNA fingerprinting) bi-weekly (June-October 2011). In addition, we measured soil organic matter, ammonium, nitrate, temperature, and pH along the moisture gradient. During these observations, both sites shifted from reducing to more oxidizing environments, based on changes in soil redox potential. At both sites, distinct bacterial communities were observed at each location along the moisture gradient, corresponding to spatial shifts in redox conditions. Additionally, we experimentally tested if hydrologic history constrained bacterial response to contemporary soil moisture conditions by exposing field soil collected from upland (dry) to wetland (saturated) plots at one wetland site to a range of moisture levels. Where soils originated from hydrologically variable field conditions, the experimental moisture additions resulted in distinct bacterial assemblages among moisture treatments. Our results revealed that bacterial communities originating from fluctuating hydrologic conditions in the field were more diverse and capable of greater changes in community composition in response to changes in soil moisture than bacterial communities shaped by stable, less dynamic, hydrologic conditions (i.e., more permanently wet or dry conditions). As a consequence, land use changes that alter hydrologic conditions may impact soil microbial communities more when environmental conditions were historically more stable compared to fluctuating. Wetland management aimed at restoring microbial functions should consider ways in which management can be adapted to overcome biological, physical, and chemical legacies from prior land use that may constrain restoration of microbial ecosystem services.

Based on a fencing experiment in the Sonian Forest near Brussels, we investigated whether, over a 6-year period, the vegetation was able to recover after having been destroyed by recreation use. Short-term trends in overall species composition were already observable during this 6-year study. Species recovery on eroded hills was related to slope, aspect, and soil type. During the considered time scale, the proportion of hemicryptophytes and the number of ancient forest species increased significantly, A downward trend was detected for Ellenberg's nitrogen and temperature indexes and for the proportion of therophytes and pioneer plants of disturbed places. Changes in species' frequencies suggest six recovery strategies: early, late, expanding, disappearing, transient, and fluctuating species. Aside from seedling reproduction from overstory influences, Luzula sylvatica appeared to be the most resilient of the species identified in the study since this species has the highest global frequency in our sampling plots and has increased its cover during the study period.

Such fluctuating selection can favor different phenotypes in different life stages, but stage-specific evolutionary responses will depend on genetic variance, covariance, and their interaction across development and across environments. Thus, quantifying how genetic architecture varies with plastic responses to the environment and across development is vital to predict whether stage-specific adaptation will occur in nature. Additionally, the interaction of genetic variation and environmental plasticity (GxE) may be stage-specific, leading to a three-way interaction between genotype, environment, and development or GxDxE. To test for these patterns, we exposed larvae and adults of Drosophila melanogaster isogenic lines derived from a natural population to extreme heat and cold stress after developmental acclimation to cool (18 degrees C) and warm (25 degrees C) conditions and measured genetic variance for thermal hardiness. We detected significant GxE that was specific to larvae and adults for cold and heat hardiness (GxDxE), but no significant genetic correlation across development for either trait at either acclimation temperature. However, cross-development phenotypic correlations for acclimation responses suggest that plasticity itself may be developmentally constrained, though rigorously testing this hypothesis requires more experimentation.

However, the efficacy of these practices is to a large extent regulated by weather variability, particularly rainfall and temperature. This is primarily the case for rainfed crops under semiarid Mediterranean climate, where large fluctuations occur in the amount and frequency of rainfall from year to year. In this 3-year field experiment, we explored the potential of fertilizer application timing and a nitrification inhibitor (3,4-dimethyl pyrazole phosphate; DMPP) to achieve low N2O, for a rainfed barely (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Pedrezuela) crop under a semiarid Mediterranean climate. Five fertilizer management practices were tested: split fertilizer application at planting and at tillering with (1) or without DMPP (2); the same split fertilizations but applying DMPP only at tillering (3); and single fertilizer application al tillering with (4) or without DMPP (5). During the dry conditions of year 1, the application of DMPP reduced N2O emissions (up to 72%) whereas timing of fertilizer application had no effect. Conversely, under the wet conditions of year 2 the effect of DMPP was suppressed but fertilizer timing was successful diminishing N2O, with lower emissions measured with single fertilizer application at tillering. In year 3, where rainfall distribution was remarkably erratic, N2O emissions were mitigated by both DMPP and single fertilizer applications. Overall, our results show that DMPP offers an opportunity for N2O abatement in semiarid soils under Mediterranean environments. The low moisture content of these soils during long periods favors nitrification; by inhibiting this process, products such as DMPP are able to achieve large N2O reductions. Although single fertilizer application at tillering as opposed to the traditional split application at planting and tillering may provide a management opportunity for N2O mitigation, we also found that this practice may lead to yield reductions in years with sufficient rainfall in spring. Therefore, general implementation of this practice should not be encouraged. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, PGPR mixtures do not always play synergistic roles in growth promotion or biological control as reflected in our previous findings and other publications. In this work, we accidentally discovered that a mixture containing two well compatible PGPR strains, Bacillus pumilus WP8 and Erwinia persicinus RA2, did not synergize in growth promotion or biological control of tomato bacterial wilt under field conditions. Considering the importance of PGPR biofilm formation in growth promotion and biocontrol activities, we hypothesized that this phenomenon may be related to inhibition of biofilm formation. In vitro experiments showed that biofilm-formation ability of WP8 was inhibited by both RA2 cells and filtered supernatants collected from RA2 cultures at 12 h (RA2-12) rather than 48 h (RA2-48), even at high-temperatures (within 100A degrees C). An in vivo experiment derived from crystal violet staining yielded similar results.

However, little is known about the effect of Zn-N co-fertilization on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or soil microbial processes involved in N2O fluxes under non-flooded irrigated conditions (during the dry season). Under these conditions, water-filled pore space continuously fluctuates following a periodic pattern and soil temperatures are in the optimum range for soil microorganisms. In this context, a field experiment was conducted using a maize (Zea mays L.) crop treated with two N levels (no N application and 120 kg N ha(-1) as urea), and three Zn sources (no Zn application, Zn sulphate, and Zn applied with a mixture of chelating compounds, DTPA-HEDTA-EDTA). Nitrous oxide, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were measured using opaque chambers, as well as the total abundances of soil bacteria, archaea and nitrifier and denitrifier communities. Zn-N co-fertilization increased cumulative N2O emissions from 0.36 kg N-N2O ha(-1) (for urea combined with Zn chelates) to 0.76 kg N-N2O ha(-1) (for urea combined with Zn sulphate), with respect to urea without Zn application. The N2O emission factors were lower (0.34%-0.72%) than the IPCC default value of 1%. Total abundances of the nosZ denitrification gene, which is involved in the reduction in N2O to dinitrogen (N-2), were reduced by 75% on average in the plots that received Zn fertilizers. This reduction may explain the higher N2O emissions in these treatments. In contrast with the case with non-irrigated crops, Zn-N co-fertilization cannot be recommended as a strategy to mitigate N2O emissions in irrigated maize under semiarid conditions, despite of the enhancement of Zn availability in soil.",,,,,"Alvarez, Jose M/R-6899-2018; Vallejo, Antonio/K-6823-2014; Montoya, Mónica/ABA-7105-2020; Castellano-Hinojosa, Antonio/P-1988-2014; Guardia, Guillermo/I-8226-2018; Recio, Jaime/S-1019-2019","Alvarez, Jose M/0000-0002-8530-7241; Vallejo, Antonio/0000-0003-0311-7450; Montoya, Mónica/0000-0003-2051-911X; Castellano-Hinojosa, Antonio/0000-0002-5785-7625; Guardia, Guillermo/0000-0002-2228-1398; Recio, Jaime/0000-0002-6317-5495",,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-7061,1872-6259,,,,FEB 1,2021,383,,,,,,,,114735,10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114735,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2020.114735,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000590747800021,View Full Record in Web of Science

At present, the relative quantitative and qualitative composition of DOM components leached from soils to water, in relation to air and water temperatures and water level fluctuations, has not been estimated in Estonia. The aim was to characterise and fractionate DOM using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography with multiple wavelength detection (DAD) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. Changes in several chromatographic/molecular and spectroscopic/optical parameters were investigated. Results: The experimental data indicated that the optical and molecular properties of DOM depend on the climate conditions, but the effect can be diverse. In cold climates, the concentration of DOM in river water can be lower (2013) or higher (2014) than in warmer climate conditions. Optical properties indicate that the quantity of humic substances (HS) is minimal under an ice cover and DOM contains more microbial-derived peptide-like constituents. Conclusions: The results point out the usefulness of HPLC-SEC and UV-vis spectroscopy for climate change-related DOM studies in real environmental conditions. Used methods enable detailed monitoring of humic molecules dissolved from the catchment soil, as well as microbial constituents (peptide-like components of DOM).

Using this coupled physical-biological model, we examined the influences of regional physical processes on the dispersion and survival of chub mackerel larvae in the ECS under climatological spring-summer temperature and circulation conditions with and without the inclusion of short-time fluctuations of a typhoon. The model results show that the seasonal variability of regional circulation, vertical stratification, and mixing play critical roles in larval dispersal and abundance distributions during the early life stages. Sensitivity experiments suggest that under the same physical environment, the larval dispersal distributions and survival rates can be significantly influenced by the location of spawning ground. The impact of a typhoon on the larval transport depends on its path, intensity, speed and timing since most typhoons swept the ECS over a time scale of a few days. The comparison of the cases with and without inclusion of Typhoon Alice indicates that cancelation of tidally-induced anti-cyclonic and typhoon-driven cyclonic currents in the ECS could limit the influence of the typhoon on the low-frequency flow and thus on larval dispersion in this region, but typhoon-enhanced vertical mixing could significantly increase larval mortality and thus decrease the abundance of surviving larvae in the nursery ground in the ECS.

The composition of oxygen in the storage chambers was regulated through the diffusion of oxygen in narrow channels. Fresh cauliflower was stored at 2.5 degrees C in laboratory chambers equipped with channels of internal diameter 2mm and of different lengths. This technique was shown to be capable of maintaining different steady-state MA compositions (O-2 from 1.5 to 18.0%, depending on the length of the diffusion channels and the mass of the product; CO2 approximate to 0%, with the help of a chemical adsorbent) for long periods of time. The steady-state compositions were stable under fluctuations in the cold room temperature. A model based on the molecular diffusion theory was developed to represent the observed phenomena. This model includes the effect of the mass of the produce and of the length and cross-sectional area of the diffusion channel, on the final gas composition in the chamber. Predictions of the diffusion model greatly underestimated the results obtained by experiment (i,e. 90% difference on the estimated channel length for an oxygen molar fraction of 0.03). Another model which takes into account convection in addition to pure diffusion, was found to be more appropriate to represent the experimental data (i.e. 10% difference on estimated length for the same conditions as above).

It is found that the measured shearing stress and sensible heat flux were strongly suppressed compared to what would be expected from current theory. Analysis of spectral behavior shows that a strong wind gradient imposed by the presence of a low-level jet at or below 100 m height during about 80% of the time is exerting strong influence on the turbulence regime by suppressing low-frequency fluctuations. The dissipation length scale was found to equal a new length scale L-vT which has the vertical velocity standard deviation in the numerator and the sum of the wind gradient and the Brunt-Vaisala frequency in the denominator. It was also found that the 10 m drag coefficient C-D10 was a strong function of this scale, with small values of L-vT giving almost zero C-D10 values. Integrating the locally found wind gradient down to the surface resulted in roughness length values several orders of magnitude less than that valid for a dynamically smooth flow. With turbulence measurements at only one height, 10 m, no conclusive explanation of this anomaly could be given.

Different variables such as indoor air temperature, relative humidity, CO2 concentration, overall electrical energy consumption of the educational center, electrical energy consumption of the building in which the monitored classroom is located, and heating energy consumption were recorded. We analyzed which of these variables were possible indicators of classroom occupancy, using the school timetable as a theoretical reference value for the validation of the results. Based on previous studies, one-hour moving averages are used to better identify the occupancy patterns by smoothing the fluctuations that are not a consequence of a change in the classroom occupancy. Histograms of each variable are used to identify the variable ranges associated within the occupancy: occupied or empty. The concentration of CO2 and electric measurements, identified in previous works as suitable to assess the occupancy patterns of rooms like offices with lower levels of occupancy, are recognized as potential occupancy indicators.

Fruit quality (titratable acidity, skin C* and ascorbic and glutamic acids) were more affected by cold storage than by differences between the RDI treatments.

Results showed that biochar application increased soil MBC significantly compared to the CK treatment, and that the effect size increased with biochar application rate. The B9.0 treatment showed the same effect on MBC as the SR treatment. Treatments effects on soil MBN were less strong than for MBC. The microbial biomass C:N ratio was significantly increased by biochar. Biochar might decrease the fraction of biomass N mineralized (K-N), which would make the soil MBN for biochar treatments underestimated, and microbial biomass C: N ratios overestimated. Seasonal fluctuation in MBC was less for biochar amended soils than for CK and SR treatments, suggesting that biochar induced a less extreme environment for microorganisms throughout the season.

To study this biodiversity, experimental carbonate substrates were exposed to colonisation by epilithic and endolithic organisms along a bathymetrical gradient from 0 to 500 m depth, during 1 and 2 years of exposure. The overall bioerosion ichnodiversity is very high and comprises 56 ichnotaxa and ichnoforms attributed to cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, fungi, other micro-chemotrophs, macroborers, grazers and epilithic attachment scars. In the intertidal, hydrodynamic force, partial emersion and strong temperature fluctuations lead to the lowest ichnospecies richness. This contrasts with the highest ichnodiversity found at 15 m under the most favourable environmental conditions. Towards aphotic depths, a gradual depletion in ichnodiversity is observed, most probably because of the restricted light availability and a slowdown in ichnocoenosis development. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), in combination with non-metrical multidimensional scaling (NMDS), was used to highlight variability in the relative abundance of traces among depths, substrate orientations and exposure times. Ichnodiversity and abundance of traces decrease significantly with depth and are higher on up-facing versus down-facing substrates, whereas differences between years were not as pronounced. This study demonstrates that statistical methods of biodiversity analysis are not per se restricted to biotaxa but may well be applied also to ichnotaxa.

Here, we compared soil N dynamics between a fertilized and irrigated urban lawn and nearby riparian meadow in Salt Lake City, Utah during a snow manipulation experiment. Snow removal increased freeze/thaw events but did not affect N pools, microbial biomass, denitrification potential, or soil oxygen (O-2). Mineral N was similar between sites despite lawn fertilization, but dissolved organic N (DON) was four-fold greater (2.1 +/- A 0.1 mg N l(-1)) in lawn soil water. Infiltration was lower in the lawn subsoil, and leaching losses (modeled with Hydrus) were small at both sites (< 2 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) despite substantial lawn fertilization. Lawn soil O-2 fluctuated between 20.9 and 1.6 % following snowmelt and irrigation, but remained near 20 % in the meadow; the lawn had more reducing microsites as indicated by iron speciation.

However, current knowledge limits our ability to predict microbial community dynamics in the face of multiple global change drivers and their implications for respiratory loss of soil carbon. Whether microorganisms will acclimate to climate warming and ameliorate predicted respiratory C losses is still debated. It also remains unclear how precipitation, another important climate change driver, will interact with warming to affect microorganisms and their regulation of respiratory C loss. We explore the dynamics of microorganisms and their contributions to respiratory C loss using a 4-year (2006-2009) field experiment in a semi-arid grassland with increased temperature and precipitation in a full factorial design. We found no response of mass-specific (per unit microbial biomass C) heterotrophic respiration to warming, suggesting that respiratory C loss is directly from microbial growth rather than total physiological respiratory responses to warming. Increased precipitation did stimulate both microbial biomass and mass-specific respiration, both of which make large contributions to respiratory loss of soil carbon. Taken together, these results suggest that, in semi-arid grasslands, soil moisture and related substrate availability may inhibit physiological respiratory responses to warming (where soil moisture was significantly lower), while they are not inhibited under elevated precipitation. Although we found no total physiological response to warming, warming increased bacterial C utilization (measured by BIOLOG EcoPlates) and increased bacterial oxidation of carbohydrates and phenols. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis as well as ANOVA testing showed that warming or increased precipitation did not change microbial community structure, which could suggest that microbial communities in semi-arid grasslands are already adapted to fluctuating climatic conditions. In summary, our results support the idea that microbial responses to climate change are multifaceted and, even with no large shifts in community structure, microbial mediation of soil carbon loss could still occur under future climate scenarios.",,,,,"zhang, Naili/D-9986-2017; Yang, Haijun/E-7186-2012; Wan, Shiqiang/L-9166-2019; Gutknecht, Jessica/AAI-3682-2021; Wan, Shiqiang/B-5799-2009","Yang, Haijun/0000-0002-9596-4907; Wan, Shiqiang/0000-0003-0631-1232; Wan, Shiqiang/0000-0003-0631-1232",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,NOV,2013,173,3,,,,,1125,1142,,10.1007/s00442-013-2685-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2685-9,,,,,,,,23736549,,,,,WOS:000325819700045,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is federally listed in both Canada and the United States and both countries have developed a recovery plan for the species. Two key management objectives are to monitor population trends and identify beneficial management practices. We used 21 y of data from the Manitoba metapopulation to assess effects of weather and land management on this species. Our results suggest the metapopulation in Manitoba is relatively stable. Western prairie fringed-orchids appear to benefit most from a combination of warm temperatures in the previous growing season followed by cool snowy but short winters and wet springs. Periodic burning (e.g., every 2-3 y) may benefit fringed-orchids, whereas grazing may be detrimental. This was not a controlled experiment, however, and gaps in the data may have influenced our results. Prescribed burning is a viable management tool for curtailing woody invasion and both burning and grazing reduce litter and grass cover, but careful consideration of timing, frequency, and intensity of application is required so management does not hinder fringed-orchid reproduction or reduce survival, while also recognizing management requirements may vary among years depending on weather.

The netting was made of high-density polyethylene (pores of 12 mm(2)) and was placed just above the ground canopy about 2.2 m above soil surface. Black plastic mulching was used to minimize soil evaporation. The surface renewal method was used to obtain values of sensible heat flux (H) from high-frequency temperature readings. Later, latent heat flux (LE) values were obtained by solving the energy balance equation. For the May-October period, seasonal ET (c) was about 843 mm in 2007 and 787 mm in 2008. The experimental weekly crop coefficients (K (cexp)) fluctuated between 0.64 and 1.2. These values represent crop coefficients adjusted to take into account the reduction in ET (c) caused by the netting and the black plastic mulching. Average K (cexp) values during mid- and end-season stages were 0.79 and 0.98, respectively. End-season K (cexp) was higher due to combination of factors related to the precipitation and low ET (o) conditions that are typical in this region during fall.

Giant foxtail and shattercane seed was collected in 1985, 1991, and 1992. Plants from this seed were grown to maturity in the field and the greenhouse in 1993 and 1994. Experiments were conducted using mature progeny seed collected from these planes to determine the influence of environment of maternal growth on seed germination. Greenhouse-raised giant foxtail seed was more dormant than field-raised seed. progeny of the 1991 giant foxtail collection had the most dormant seed, whereas progeny of the 1992 collection had the least dormant seed. Field-raised shattercane seed was more dormant than greenhouse-raised seed, but this dormancy was easily overcome by placing them in fluctuating temperatures. Moist stratification of giant foxtail seed increased its overall germination and reduced the differences in germination between individual collections and between field- and greenhouse-raised seed lots. Moist stratification of shattercane seed resulted in increased variability in germination within and among seed lots. Subjecting shattercane seed to freezing and thawing was most detrimental and caused an 89% reduction in germination due to seed death. These data indicate that before overwintering, giant foxtail seed differed in germination percentage, but overwintering reduced these differences. Shattercane seed produced in different environments had similar germination percentage.

We used an amphibious killifish (Kryptolebias marmoratus) to test the hypotheses that organisms reared in fluctuating environments (i) will make no developmental changes to suit any one environment because fixing traits to suit one environment could be maladaptive for another, and (ii) will be highly phenotypically flexible as adults because their early life experiences predict high environmental variability in the future. We reared fish under constant (water) or fluctuating (water-air) environments until adulthood and assessed a suite of traits along the oxygen cascade (e.g. neuroepithelial cell density and size, cutaneous capillarity, gill morphology, ventricle size, red muscle morphometrics, terrestrial locomotor performance). To evaluate the capacity for phenotypic flexibility, a subset of adult fish from each rearing condition was then air-exposed for 14 days before the same traits were measured. In support of the developmental plasticity hypothesis, traits involved with O-2 sensing and uptake were largely unaffected by water-air fluctuations during early life, but we found marked developmental changes in traits related to O-2 transport, utilization and locomotor performance. In contrast, we found no evidence supporting the phenotypic flexibility hypothesis. Adult fish from both rearing conditions exhibited the same degree of phenotypic flexibility in various O-2 sensing- and uptake-related traits. In other cases, water-air fluctuations attenuated adult phenotypic flexibility despite the fact that phenotypic flexibility is hypothesized to be favoured when environments fluctuate. Overall, we condude that exposure to environmental fluctuations during development in K. marmoratus can dramatically alter the constitutive adult phenotype, as well as diminish the scope for phenotypic flexibility in later life.",,,,,,"Rossi, Giulia/0000-0002-4812-8869",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,AUG,2020,223,16,,,,,,,jeb228304,10.1242/jeb.228304,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.228304,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000576694400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish a small-scale parasitoid rearing process adjusted to the Sahel conditions that can be scaled-up as necessary. We conducted experiments to fine-tune and standardize the rearing technique of H. hebetor for cottage industrial use.

As a sessile organism that has adapted to life in estuaries and intertidal zones, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica can tolerate wide fluctuations in temperature and salinity and survive for weeks out of water. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the remarkable stress tolerance of the eastern oyster, we studied the transcriptomic changes induced by exposure to air and cold stress. Eastern oysters were maintained for 7 days under four conditions, namely, in seawater (normal) at 22 degrees C, in air at 22 degrees C, in seawater at 5 degrees C and in air at 5 degrees C, and then sampled for RNA sequencing. ResultsTranscriptomic analysis revealed that many genes involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication were downregulated in oysters exposed to air and cold, which indicates that stress inhibits cell division. Exposure to air at 22 degrees C induced a concerted inhibition of apoptosis through the upregulation of expanded inhibitors of apoptosis and the downregulation of caspases. Interactions between TNF and NF-kappa B signalling implied a reduction in the inflammatory response and immune functions. Key genes for proline production, fatty acid synthesis and chromosomal proteins were upregulated during exposure to low temperatures, which suggested that proline accumulation, energy conservation, and epigenetic modification of chromosomes are important for coping with cold stress. The upregulation of melatonin, FMRFamide, and neural acetylcholine receptors indicate the significance of the neurohormonal regulation of homeostasis. ConclusionThese results show that air exposure and cold stress alter the expression of key genes for cell division, apoptosis, proline accumulation, fatty acid metabolism, neurohormonal signalling, and epigenetic modifications, suggesting regulation of these processes plays an important role in the stress response of the eastern oyster and possibly other marine molluscs.

Willing to specify the estimation of biomass by chlorophyll we had, for the first time, established dependence of chlorophyll A (Chl A) content in the cells of different species, cultivated under similar conditions, on their volume and weight expressed in carbon (C), and, afterwards, we suggested a test method to determine C/Chl A ratio in experiment. Information accumulated as for cultivation of different microalgae under various conditions of lightning, temperature and inorganic nutrition was colligated in the scientific literature in the form of equations, which allow calculating expected C/Chl A ratio for particular phytoplankton communities under the given conditions. However, there should be noted a substantial difference between populations functioning within natural communities and populations of particular species cultivated in the artificial environments. As a rule, algae cultures are maintained in the log growth phase and thus, all researches of cultures can be referred to the primary phase of development of the populations. Whereas populations within natural communities go through all stages of development: from the log growth phase at the beginning to the period of stagnation and dying. Presence of significant amount of dying and even dead cells in the natural communities was found whilst using luminescence microscopy. Therefore, while studying C/Chl A ratio of natural phytoplankton communities, age of population of dominant species at the moment of measurement can be determinative. In this respect, we set a task to analyze fluctuation of C/Chl A ratio in phytoplankton communities in the coastal region of the Black Sea near Sevastopol and possible influence on it of all aggregate factors, taking into account supposed age of population, where amount of its biomass may be considered as a relative index. As a result, it was established that with the increase of natural phytoplankton communities biomass, relative content of Chl A in them decreases. It proves hypothesis about ageing of population within their composition and allows us to consider amount of biomass as an indirect index of their age. Seasonal variation of phytoplankton development in the coastal area in general is determined by seasonal changes of environmental parameters. Regularly, minimum value of C/Chl A is typical for the periods of minimum temperature and light value. It defines peculiar domed form of distribution of C/Chl A ratio on the diagrams of seasonal variation, where it can be clearly traced not only through our data from 2009 and 2010, but also through the data from other authors gathered in 2000-2003. Using domed distribution, we carried out rough estimate of content of inactive substance in the total biomass. Such estimate is based on the assumption that on the bottom edge of dome and underneath dome there are set the dates which correspond to the communities, which biomass is composed of young population with minimal index of C/Chl A ratio. According to this estimate dead matter content within total biomass of phytoplankton near the mouth of Sevastopol Bay falls inside the limits of 0 to 90% and grows along with the increase of biomass.

In softwater lakes in Western Europe, hydrological state (submersed/emersed), carbon dioxide and ammonium levels and species interactions are considered as driving forces in structuring amphibious plant communities. In this study we aimed at evaluating the relative importance of these factors for four species in a competitive neighbourhood. Softwater lake habitat was simulated during one growing season in laboratory conditions, mimicking water level fluctuation, photoperiod and temperature. Artificial communities consisted of small populations of four softwater macrophyte species: Luronium natans, Baldellia ranunculoides ssp. repens, Eleocharis multicaulis and Hydrocotyle vulgaris. These communities were subjected to two levels of carbon dioxide and ammonium. Additionally, monocultures of Baldellia and Eleocharis were grown at a higher nutrient level combination in order to measure their competitive response in a community. Time (hydrological state) and species identity turned out to be the only consistently significant factors determining community composition. Plant performance was clearly species-dependent, while carbon dioxide and ammonium did not have major effects. The competitive response was significant in both Eleocharis and Baldellia. Competition intensity was highest in the emersed state. Carbon dioxide had a supplementary effect on the within-species performance in Luronium, Baldellia and Eleocharis, with high carbon dioxide level mainly resulting in more flowers and more stolons. Community outcomes and competitive responses in aquatic macrophytes appear difficult to predict, because of mixed life strategies and morphological and functional plasticity. We conclude that hydrological state was the only important environmental factor. The identity of the species that were present-implying species interactions-largely determined community outcome.

However, pH/pCO(2)levels vary spatially and temporally in marine environments, and this variation can affect organism responses to pH/pCO(2). On coral reefs, diel pH/pCO(2)variability at the individual reef scale has been reported in a few studies, but variation among microhabitats within a reef remains poorly understood. This study determined the pH/pCO(2)variability of three different reefs, and three contrasting coral reef microhabitats (dominated by hard coral, soft coral, or open substrate) within each reef. Three SeaFET pH loggers were deployed simultaneously at the three microhabitats within a reef over a 9-day period. This was repeated at three different reefs around the Lizard Island lagoon. The loggers recorded pH(T)and temperature every 5 min. Water samples were collected from each microhabitat during four points of the tidal cycle (high, low, rising, and falling) and analysed for total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon. The data show a clear dielpCO(2)cycle, increasing overnight and decreasing during the day, in association with photosynthesis and respiration cycles. DielpCO(2)differed more between reefs than between microhabitats within reefs. Variation between reefs was most likely influenced by water flow, with the more protected (low flow) reefs experiencing a greater range inpCO(2)(Delta 250 mu atm) than the exposed (high flow) reefs (Delta 116 mu atm). These results add to a growing body of the literature on the diel variation ofpCO(2)of shallow, nearshore environments and suggest that when projecting futurepCO(2)levels, it is important to consider reef metabolism as well as physical and hydrodynamic factors.",,,,,"Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011; Fabricius, Katharina/F-1759-2010; Watson, Sue-Ann/C-3172-2013","Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498; Fabricius, Katharina/0000-0001-7671-4358; Watson, Sue-Ann/0000-0002-9818-7429; Hannan, Kelly/0000-0002-8280-9422",,,,,,,,,,,,,0722-4028,1432-0975,,,,OCT,2020,39,5,,,,,1391,1406,,10.1007/s00338-020-01973-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-020-01973-z,,JUL 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000549374700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used a multiple experimental approach to investigate how diet quality and larval predation risk affected the rates of growth and development in painted frogs (Discoglossus galganoi), and how these changes influence post-metamorphic performance. A high-energy diet entailed growth advantages only if predation risk did not constrain energy acquisition, whereas diet quality affected primarily the extension of the larval period. Predation risk influenced juvenile shape, most likely via the effects on growth and differentiation rates. Juvenile frogs emerging from predator environments had shorter legs and longer bodies than those from the nonpredator tanks. However, these morphological changes did not translate into differences in relative jumping performance. Neither size-adjusted lipid storage nor fluctuating asymmetry was significantly influenced by food quality or predation risk.

Large thermal fluctuations of air and water temperatures affect the viability of pollen, causing high levels of spikelet sterility (blanking), resulting in reduced yields per hectare. Counting viable pollen grains, at the time of anthesis, may allow determining, ahead, whether there will be yield losses by spikelet sterility; besides, knowing the potential pollen viability serves as a powerful tool for material selection in breeding programs, and for determining which management factors may influence blanking. If performed manually, counting total and viable pollen grains can be extremely tedious, producing highly variable results. The present work had for objectives to develop and evaluate a system, based on imagery analysis, for counting total and viable pollen in rice anthers. At the time of anthesis, three panicles were collected from plot treatments of two field experiments in which the effects of different management factors (variety, water height, N rate, and spatial arrangement) on spikelet sterility were evaluated. Two spikelets and four anthers were sampled from each panicle; pollen grains were extracted from anthers and photographed. Manual and digital counts were made on the images to determine total and viable pollen. Digital count was performed with the software SigmaScan Pro, setting some parameters on the imagery before counting. Precision and accuracy of the digital method were estimated. The results indicated that the digital pollen count showed a very good precision and accuracy and could be used to estimate pollen viability, and as a response variable to compare management treatments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0718-5839,,,,,JAN-MAR,2011,71,1,,,,,16,22,,10.4067/S0718-58392011000100002,http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0718-58392011000100002,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000289003500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Samples of flower buds on spurs collected on June 5, 2000, were analyzed for their sugar contents. The analyzed data were not consistent. Regarding the flower bud abortion, the reduction of numbers of floral spurs may reduce competition among spurs of the tree, which could explain the lower percentages of flower buds aborted as compared to control trees. On the other hand, lower percentages of flower buds aborted on the defoliated trees than on the control trees and this may be related to the earlier and deeper dormancy caused by the defoliation. When the leaves were cut off, leaf fall was beginning. Therefore, the earlier defoliation may induce deeper dormancy of the flower buds that could be less sensitive to temperature fluctuations during the winter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,90-6605-766-1,,,,2002,,587,,,,,369,373,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.49,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.587.49,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000180301400049,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objectives of this study were to quantify soil macro-invertebrate abundance and composition with and without N fertiliser application during the wheat-cropping phase of a cotton-based rotational system. Comparison with invertebrate abundance was also made with an adjacent area of native vegetation. The experiment was first established in 1993, but invertebrate sampling was only conducted between June and December 1997, during the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) phase at 6,15 and 23 weeks after planting (WAP) the crop and in nearby native vegetation at the same time. Ants were identified to genera and all other invertebrates to order. Changes in crop cover and soil temperature were also evaluated at 6, 15 and 23 WAR Ant abundance was higher in the treatments where N fertiliser was not applied, but only later in the season (summer), compared to the treatments where N fertiliser was applied. Other invertebrates showed a similar pattern of recovery to ants, with higher levels of abundance in summer compared with earlier in the wheat growing cycle. The use of ants as bioindicators for monitoring changes in soil health within cotton-based rotational systems, especially in the wheat-cropping phase, is complicated by the confounding factor of seasonality, although their fluctuations in abundance mimic other invertebrates.

In this review, we highlighted the role of fungi in decomposition and reconsider the role of bacteria, neglected in the past, identifying key research needs and knowledge. Particular attention is given to the succession of different taxa with different ecological role that are able to use a substrate that undergoes to chemical and structural modifications. The quality of substrates is a critical factor that influences the microbial community together with environmental variables, such as temperature and moisture.

However, there has been little research regarding geophytes on green roofs. This experiment was conducted to study the performance of 26 species of geophytes on a green roof during 2005-2006 in Sheffield, UK. The geophytes were grown at two substrate depths (5 cm and 10 cm) of substrate on a green roof without irrigation. To investigate the susceptibility of geophytes to competition from a covering of permanent plants, the geophytes were grown with or without a surface vegetation layer of Sedum album. Overall, the growth, survival rate, regeneration and flowering of geophytes were more successful at a substrate depth of 10 cm than of 5 cm, probably because of improved moisture retention, fewer temperature fluctuations and the protection from digging by animals. The flowering period was limited to spring, therefore, it is recommended to combine with other plant species such as covering plants. Geophyte species did not compete much with S. album and Sedum cover had no significant effects on the growth, survival rate, regeneration and flowering of geophytes in most species. Iris bucharica, Muscari azureum, Tulipa clusiana var. chrysantha, Tulipa humilis, Tulipa tarda and Tulipa turkestanica had good performance at the substrate depth of 5 cm.

The mean biomass (kg/km(2)) indices were calculated. The time series analyses were carried out by means of Min/Max Auto-correlation Factor Analysis (MAFA) and Dynamic Factor Analysis (DFA). The two techniques provided coherent results, indicating that the two most important trends in the response variables are an increase in terms of both LPUE and survey biomass index, and a fluctuating pattern, even though characterized by a general increasing tendency. What drove these trends is less clear, even though the available evidence suggests that the reduction of fishing effort has been more important than environmental factors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The leaf beetle Diorhabda carinulata (Desbrochers) was introduced into North America from Fukang, China (latitude 44 degrees N) to control saltcedars (Tamarix spp.), but failed to establish south of 38 degrees N latitude because of a mismatched critical daylength response for diapause induction. The daylength response caused beetles to enter diapause too early in the season to survive the duration of winter at southern latitudes. Using climate chambers, we characterized the critical daylength response for diapause induction (CDL) in three ecotypes of Diorhabda beetles originating from 36,38, and 43 degrees N latitudes in Eurasia. In a field experiment, the timing of reproductive diapause and voltinism were compared among ecotypes by rearing the insects on plants in the field. CDL declined with latitude of origin among Diorhabda ecotypes. Moreover, CDL in southern (<39 degrees N latitude) ecotypes was shortened by more than an hour when the insects were reared under a fluctuating 35-15 degrees C thermoperiod than at a constant 25 degrees C.

However, natural communities are shaped by ecological interactions and environmental conditions often leading to nonrandom species extinctions. Here, we manipulated a natural phytoplankton community by generating a taxonomic diversity gradient based on rare species exclusions and conducted a mesocosm experiment to investigate the diversity effects on ecosystem functioning (resource use efficiency and biomass) under two nutrient levels. We quantified two functional traits (size and photosynthetic pigments) to evaluate the relation of functional diversity and ecosystem functioning. In a second experimental phase we simulated temperature fluctuations to assess the role of diversity on temporal stability of ecosystem functioning. We did not find a significant effect of diversity on ecosystem functioning and the temporal stability of ecosystem functioning, regardless of nutrient level. These results indicated that loss of biomass caused by rare species extinctions was compensated by the species retained in the diversity gradient. Phytoplankton size diversity was positively related to diversity, but this was not transferred into a positive diversity effect on ecosystem functioning. Additionally, the loss of species did not result in a loss of pigment diversity. The lack of a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship in our study may be due to the weak coupling of functional and species diversity and a low manifestation of functional diversity under the evaluated conditions. We emphasize that more realistic biodiversity loss scenarios in experiments can yield different results from those in classical BEF research paradigms.",,,,,"Gerhard, Miriam/AAX-4017-2020","Striebel, Maren/0000-0003-2061-2154; Gerhard, Miriam/0000-0002-0472-9435",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,MAR,2021,66,3,,,,,779,792,,10.1002/lno.11642,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11642,,NOV 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000583485300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specimens were darker and had increased chlorophyll densities (chlorophyll per coral surface area) under low-light conditions caused both by increased depth and, in shallow-growing specimens, by the winter season. However, while increased depth involved increased zooxanthella chlorophyll content, acclimation to low irradiances by shallow-growing corals during the winter mostly involved an increase in algal density. In shallow-growing corals, both zooxanthella chlorophyll content and coral chlorophyll density fluctuated seasonally in correlation with light more than with nitrogen or temperature. This could be related to the fact that reefs in Eilat, Israel, are exposed to more solar radiation than many other reefs in the world. Histological analyses of high-light corals showed that zooxanthellae were located deeper inside the host tissue and were smaller in diameter compared to zooxanthellae from low-light corals. Additionally, while deep-water colonies hosted clade C zooxanthellae, colonies growing in shallow waters, both in high- and very low-light environments, hosted clade A. These clade differences were found to affect coral physiology, as examined in a short-term thermal stress experiment, with clade-A colonies having higher thermal resilience than clade-C colonies, Taken together, our results show evidence of different mechanisms that help adjust the light-capturing abilities of S. pistillata zooxanthellae to spatial and. temporal changes in irradiance.",,,,,"Loya, Yossi/J-3039-2012; Loya, Joseph/AAJ-9014-2020","Loya, Yossi/0000-0001-6870-9444; Winters, Gidon/0000-0001-9997-2034",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,,,,,MAY 29,2009,384,,,,,,107,119,,10.3354/meps08036,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps08036,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000267404000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

A series of inter-rotation experiments has been established at two sites with contrasting soils to investigate options for plantation management that will maintain soil fertility and stand productivity in subsequent rotations. These experiments include alternatives for managing harvest residues, use of inter-row legumes and nutrient application rate trials. After harvest, about one-quarter of the N and half of the P and Ca in the trees was exported from the sites in logs. Most of the exported N and P was in the wood, whereas most Ca was in the bark. Where burning was used to remove harvest residues and prepare the site for planting, more than 500 kg ha(-1) of N was lost from the more fertile site. Retention of harvest residues tended to increase soil moisture, moderate diurnal temperature fluctuations and enhance the pool of potentially available N. Soil organic matter content declined in the first two years following harvest, largely due to a reduction in the labile pool of soil carbon. There are indications of a reversal in this trend in the third year after harvesting, probably due to inputs of plant residue from turnover of roots. Early growth rates of trees were enhanced by retention of harvest residues, but longer-term measurements are needed to confirm this trend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,979-8764-33-1,,,,1999,,,,,,,53,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000181552600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the inhibitory effects of different NIs for vegetable production under soil and environmental conditions in China are not fully understood. To evaluate the effects of chemical and biological NIs on N2O emissions and the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), a 2-yr field experiment with four treatments (regular urea (Urea), urea + dicyandiamide (DCD), urea + nitrapyrin (CP) and urea + biological nitrification inhibitor (BNI)) performed in triplicate was carried out in an intensive vegetable field using the static chamber and gas chromatography method. The results showed that the CP and BNI treatments shifted the main form of soil inorganic nitrogen (N) from nitrate (NO3-), which was the case for the Urea and DCD treatments, to ammonium (NH4+). The variations in soil temperature, moisture and NO3- content regulated the seasonal fluctuations of N2O emissions. Moreover, the DCD treatment did not significantly affect N2O or agronomic NUE relative to the Urea treatment, while CP and BNI significantly decreased annual N2O emissions by 16.5% and 18.1% and improved NUE by 12.6% and 6.7%, respectively. Thus, a markedly lower global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) was observed in the CP and BNI treatments relative to the Urea and DCD treatments.

The FASINEX moored array measured upper ocean currents, temperature, and conductivity between January and June 1986 in a region of the Sargasso Sea heavily populated by strong upper ocean fronts. The background jets associated with these features have typical cross-front scales of 20 km, maximum currents of 0.5 m s(-1), and relative vorticities of +0.3f. In the vicinity of fronts, observed near-inertial currents have short horizontal scales, show no clear horizontal phase structure, and trace out elongated current ellipses with elevated across-front over along-front variance. During these periods, inertial band-pass buoyancy fluctuations often correlate with major-axis currents. WKB ray-tracing models of propagating, monochromatic plane waves exhibit horizontal phase propagation and correlations between minor-axis currents and buoyancy and thus cannot explain these results. Models of near-inertial internal waves reflected or trapped by a barotropic frontal jet produce mode-like structures with short horizontal scales, little horizontal phase propagation, and anisotropic current ellipses aligned primarily cross front. Model buoyancy may correlate with one or both current ellipse components, depending on the incidence angle of the wave and the degree to which it reflects. Completely reflected waves with horizontal scales similar to those of the front and near-normal incidence angle produce current ellipses and correlation patterns consistent with the observations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 15,1997,102,C2,,,,,3237,3253,,10.1029/96JC03209,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/96JC03209,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997WH73700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Trees exposed to CO2 enrichment for 9 yr showed smaller diurnal stem radius contractions (by 46 +/- 16%) and expansions (42 +/- 16%) compared with trees exposed to ambient CO2. Additionally, there was a delay in the timing of daily maximum (40 +/- 12min) and minimum (63 +/- 14min) radius values for trees growing under elevated CO2. Parameters optimized with the hydraulic model suggested that CO2-enriched trees had an increased flow resistance between the xylem and bark, representing a more buffered water supply system. Soil warming did not alter diurnal fluctuation dynamics or the CO2 response. Elevated CO2 altered the hydraulic water flow and storage system within L. decidua trees, which might have contributed to enhanced growth during 9 yr of CO2 enrichment and could ultimately influence the future competitive ability of this key tree-line species.",,,,,"Zweifel, Roman/C-2852-2009","Zweifel, Roman/0000-0001-9438-0582; Hagedorn, Frank/0000-0001-5218-7776; Dawes, Melissa A./0000-0003-4919-0151; Rixen, Christian/0000-0002-2486-9988",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-646X,1469-8137,,,,JUN,2014,202,4,,,,,1237,1248,,10.1111/nph.12742,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.12742,,,,,,,,24571288,,,,,WOS:000335470200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we report the results of a long-term experimental study of European plaice Pleuronectes platessa L. and explore relationships between blood plasma and ambient water chemistry over a 12 mo reproductive cycle. Overall, blood plasma was found to be highly regulated, with few elements exhibiting strong, if any, correlation with ambient concentrations. This sets a first order limit on the sensitivity of otolith chemistry to fluctuations in ambient seawater chemistry. The observed temporal, ontogenetic and sex-specific variations in blood plasma elemental concentrations indicated significant physiological influences on elemental uptake and processing mechanisms. Physiological variables exerted relatively strong influences on the uptake and regulation of the softer, more thiophilic elements (Mn, Cu, Zn, Se and Pb), as well as Sr and Ca. By contrast, seasonal and sex-related variations were relatively minor among the hard acid metal ions (Li+, Mg2+, K+, Rb+, Ba2+). Overall, plasma elemental concentrations covaried most strongly and consistently with plasma protein concentrations. For this exclusively marine species, seasonal changes in physiology governed intra-annual variations in blood chemistry and, by implication, also regulate ion availability to the otolith.

Simulations of biomass production, yield, and water use of irrigated maize, soybean, and sorghum were compared with experimental data collected at Auzeville, southwestern France. Experimental data for growing seasons 1986, 1989, and 1990 (dry years) were used, including three irrigation levels (full, deficit, and no irrigation) each year. Calibration of a small number of crop parameters was conducted using the most complex submodels. Using these most complex submodels, simulations compared well with measurements. with the Wilmott index of agreement fluctuating from 0.956 to 0.997 (an index of 1.0 indicating perfect agreement). The model appeared suitable for applications over a wide range of water availability and stress conditions.

A simple cascading method for soil water transport (non-constrained drainage) appeared to be a valid alternative to more complex numerical methods. All ET submodels predicted similar seasonal ET, but differences in vapor pressure deficit estimation led to growth overprediction in some cases. Simpler submodels would have performed similarly to the most complex submodels if used during calibration.

When nutrients are limited, there are potential tradeoffs between investing into offspring number versus individual offspring size. In social insects, colony investment in offspring size and number may shift in response to colony needs and the availability of food resources. We experimentally manipulated the diet of a polymorphic ant species (Solenopsis invicta) to test how access to the carbohydrate and amino acid components of nectar resources affect colony investment in worker number, body size, size distributions, and individual percent fat mass. We reared field-collected colonies on one of four macronutrient treatment supplements: water, amino acids, carbohydrates, and amino acid and carbohydrates. Having access to carbohydrates nearly doubled colony biomass after 60 days. This increase in biomass resulted from an increase in worker number and mean worker size. Access to carbohydrates also altered worker body size distributions. Finally, we found a negative relationship between worker number and size, suggesting a tradeoff in colony investment strategies. This tradeoff was more pronounced for colonies without access to carbohydrate resources. The monopolization of plant-based resources has been implicated in the ecological success of ants. Our results shed light on a possible mechanism for this success, and also have implications for the success of introduced species. In addition to increases in colony size, our results suggest that having access to plant-based carbohydrates can also result in larger workers that may have better individual fighting ability, and that can withstand greater temperature fluctuations and periods of food deprivation.",,,,,,"Wilder, Shawn/0000-0003-0359-7220",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUL 21,2015,10,7,,,,,,,e0132440,10.1371/journal.pone.0132440,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0132440,,,,,,,,26196147,,,,,WOS:000358547600035,View Full Record in Web of Science

A total of 18 plots (5 m in diameter) were established in three forest stands without aspen a few kilometers apart. Each stand had 3 litter plots (litter added) and 3 control plots. Pre-treatment samples were compared with those collected after litter addition. The litter addition affected the carabid-assemblage structure by increasing the catches of some species and decreasing the catch of one species. The number of carabid species was similar in control and litter plots. The litter effect was smaller than variation among forest stands and year-to-year fluctuations. There was a strong temporal constancy among the plots: rich plots remained rich from year to year and similarly poor plots remained poor. The significant influence of leaf litter on carabid abundance can be attributable to both abiotic factors (microenvironmental conditions, especially humidity and temperature), and biotic ones (changes in niche structure, improved food supply). Leaf litter seems to have an effect on carabid distribution patterns, and deciduous trees scattered among conifers are likely to be of importance on carabid fauna in boreal forests.",,,,,"Punttila, Pekka/ABH-1138-2020; Koivula, Matti/AAH-4156-2020","Punttila, Pekka/0000-0002-0076-9499; Koivula, Matti/0000-0001-6415-4904",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,,,,,AUG,1999,22,4,,,,,424,435,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1999.tb00579.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1999.tb00579.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081932300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Free amino acid content of fermented fish paste was fluctuated during the fermentation period but most of free amino acids were increased. Almost all fatty acids decreased during fermentation except stearic acid, EPA and DHA. The essential fatty acid found was linolenic acid which was higher in initial period.

This study investigates the heat flux dynamics of the tropical green roof ecosystem to provide a scientific basis for design and management. Green roof experimental plots were established to monitor the total solar radiation, net radiation, and micrometeorological parameters. The data permit calculation of sensible and latent heat fluxes using the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) method. The results demonstrated the life cycle characteristics of heat flux components. The dynamic changes of sensible (H), latent (lambda E) and soil (G) heat fluxes were denoted by single-peak quadratic curves. Net radiation (R(n)) was largely determined by quantity and variation trends of lambda E, reaching at 1300h a maximum lambda E of 655 W m(-2) and maximum H of 369 W m(-2). Temporal heat-flux fluctuations were strongly correlated with meteorological variables. Extreme values of H and lambda E correlated well with precipitation and temperature (R(2) =0.78). Dynamics of heat-flux magnitude and partitioning demonstrated notable differences by daily and season periods. They displayed considerable variations in flux partitioning, with Bowen ratios strongly correlated with weather conditions and vegetation types. The energy budget of the green roof ecosystem is unbalanced with a heat loss of about 15.5% caused by soil and canopy heat reserve. The passive indoor cooling effect under the green roof is attributed to the unbalanced energy closure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated whether compensatory growth has long-term consequences for patterns of senescence. Using three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), we show that a brief period of dietary manipulation in early life affected skeletal growth rate not only during the manipulation itself, but also during a subsequent compensatory phase when fish caught up in size with controls. However, this growth acceleration influenced swimming endurance and its decline over the course of the breeding season, with a faster decline in fish that had undergone faster growth compensation. Similarly, accelerated growth led to a more pronounced reduction in the breeding period (as indicated by the duration of sexual ornamentation) over the following two breeding seasons, suggesting faster reproductive senescence. Parallel experiments showed a heightened effect of accelerated growth on these age-related declines in performance if the fish were under greater time stress to complete their compensation prior to the breeding season. Compensatory growth led to a reduction in median life span of 12% compared to steadily growing controls. While life span was independent of the eventual adult size attained, it was negatively correlated with the age-related decline in swimming endurance and sexual ornamentation. These results, complementary to those found when growth trajectories were altered by temperature rather than dietary manipulations, show that the costs of accelerated growth can last well beyond the time over which growth rates differ and are affected by the time available until an approaching life-history event such as reproduction.",,,,,"Monaghan, Pat/E-6810-2015; Metcalfe, Neil B./C-5997-2009","Metcalfe, Neil B./0000-0002-1970-9349",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,APR,2016,30,4,,,,,625,635,,10.1111/1365-2435.12538,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12538,,,,,,,,27610000,,,,,WOS:000373920800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The simulated currents, temperatures, and chlorophyll a concentrations generally agreed well with both the remotely sensed satellite images and observational data collected during a field experiment from September to November 2010. Scenario tests for an individual wind-driven upwelling event under a variety of hypothetical physical forcing conditions showed that shelf currents and biogeochemical variables were largely a function of wind stress and stratification. However, the functional relationships derived from this single wind event could not be extrapolated to other periods of the upwelling season, due to the additional influence of 3-D mesoscale processes on the shelf. The presence, intensification, and propagation of a coastal anticyclonic eddy during the study period strongly influenced the spatial and temporal variations in nutrient profiles, which in turn caused fluctuations in vertical nutrient fluxes that were largely independent of wind stress.

Toward explaining such high prevalence, larval behavior and passive-transport processes were evaluated experimentally for their roles in waterborne parasite transmission. Using a new application of laser and digital video imaging technologies, we quantified cercarial movements in still water and in simulated field flows. In still water, downward swimming in response to light,irrespective of intensity or source, and gravity brought larvae to the bottom three-times faster than gravitational sinking alone. A 33% elevation in temperature (18-24degreesC) caused a 71% increase in swim speed. In flume flows characteristic of southern California salt marshes (u(*) =. 0.2 cm/s, occurring >80% of the time), vertical larval distributions were highly bottom skewed. The mean downward swim speed (0.59 cm/s at 24degreesC) was three times faster than turbulent fluctuations (w' = 0.23 cm/s), indicating that cercariae overpowered eddies to reach the bed. When flume flows simulated rare storm events (u(*) = 0.8 cm/s, w' = 0.95 cm/s, occurring less than or equal to1% of the time), turbulence overwhelmed behavioral effects and homogeneously mixed larvae throughout the water column. Environmentally triggered, downward swimming can thus quickly bring larvae to the bed, promoting contact with benthic intermediate hosts (snails and crabs) under most flow conditions.

For the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, temperature and humidity refuge areas for amphibian hosts exist but are difficult to manipulate. Other environmental features that may affect the outcome of infection include water quality, drying regimes, abundance of alternate hosts and isolation from other hosts. We identified relationships between water bodies with these features and infection levels in the free-living hosts inhabiting them. Where significant relationships were identified, we used a series of controlled experiments to test for causation. Infection loads were negatively correlated with the salt concentration of the aquatic habitat and the degree of water level fluctuation and positively correlated with fish abundance. However, only the relationship with salt was confirmed experimentally. Free-living hosts inhabiting water bodies with mean salinities of up to 3.5 ppt had lower infection loads than those exposed to less salt. The experiment confirmed that exposure to sodium chloride concentrations > 2 ppt significantly reduced host infection loads compared to no exposure (0 ppt). These results suggest that the exposure of amphibians to salt concentrations found naturally in lentic habitats may be responsible for the persistence of some susceptible species in the presence of B. dendrobatidis. By manipulating the salinity of water bodies, it may be possible to create refuges for declining amphibians, thus allowing them to be reintroduced to their former ranges.",,,,,,"Clulow, John/0000-0001-8991-1449",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,MAR,2015,177,3,,,,,901,910,,10.1007/s00442-014-3157-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-014-3157-6,,,,,,,,25416999,,,,,WOS:000350033500024,View Full Record in Web of Science

Copulation duration varied between 6 min and more than 1 h (xBAR = 23.19 min +/- 12.74). In the clutch deposited immediately after the copulation, most copulation durations resulted in high sperm precedence for the last male. Several experimentally interrupted short matings still resulted in 100% precedence. However, most interrupted copulations of 10 min or less resulted in a low P2. After long, uninterrupted copulations, P2 remained high in clutches that were collected up to 9 days after the mating. After interrupted short copulations, P2 fluctuated or remained at a low level from the first clutch onwards. This indicates that sperm mixing probably starts within 24 h and that after a long copulation virtually no rival sperm is left in the female's sperm storage organs. As most natural copulations are long, complete removal of rival sperm seems to be common in S. danae. Only 3 of 17 variables investigated explained a significant amount of the variation in copulation duration. Copulations shortened with increasing temperature and for each additional mating of the male. The strongest effect however, was due to time of day: early morning copulations lasted longer than midday copulations.

The results demonstrated that there was a strong correlation between forest biomass and CWD mass. The single exponential decay model well fit the CWD density loss at this site, and as the CWD decomposed, the CWD density decreased significantly. Annual temperature and precipitation were all significantly correlated with the annual mass decay rate. The K contents and the C/ N ratio of the CWD decreased as the CWD decayed, but the C, N, P, Ca and Mg contents increased. We observed a significant CWD decay effect on the soil C, N and Mg contents, especially the soil C content. The soil N, P, K, Ca and Mg contents exhibited large fluctuations, but the variation had no obvious regularity and changed with different decay times. The results showed that CWD was a critical component of nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. Further research is needed to determine the effect of diameter, plant tissue components, secondary wood compounds, and decomposer organisms on the CWD decay rates in the Qinling Mountains, which will be beneficial to clarifying the role of CWD in carbon cycles of forest ecosystems.",,,,,,"Yuan, Jie/0000-0002-5094-7441",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,APR 6,2017,12,4,,,,,,,e0175203,10.1371/journal.pone.0175203,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175203,,,,,,,,28384317,,,,,WOS:000399371900118,View Full Record in Web of Science

A summer ice-free Arctic Ocean is likely by the mid-2040s if arctic surface air temperature (SAT) increases 4 degrees C by 2050 and climate variability is similar to the past relatively warm two decades. If such a SAT increase is reduced by one-half or if a future Arctic experiences a range of SAT fluctuation similar to the past five decades, a summer ice-free Arctic Ocean would be unlikely before 2050. If SAT increases 4 degrees C by 2050, summer ice volume decreases to very low levels (10-37% of the 1978-2009 summer mean) as early as 2025 and remains low in the following years, while summer ice extent continues to fluctuate annually. Summer ice volume may be more sensitive to warming while summer ice extent more sensitive to climate variability. The rate of annual mean ice volume decrease relaxes approaching 2050. This is because, while increasing SAT increases summer ice melt, a thinner ice cover increases winter ice growth. A thinner ice cover also results in a reduced ice export, which helps to further slow ice volume loss. Because of enhanced winter ice growth, arctic winter ice extent remains nearly stable and therefore appears to be a less sensitive climate indicator. Citation: Zhang, J., M. Steele, and A.

This refers to the number density, the microphysical properties (size distribution, refractive index, effective radius), and to the height distribution. In most cases the actual properties are not known. Using lidar data together with models can help improve the knowledge regarding the particulate atmospheric constituents which affect local radiative forcing, the radiation balance of the earth, and thus climate. This paper presents an attempt to integrate elastic backscatter lidar data in OPAC software package in order to find the most realistic aerosol vertical distribution and their optical and microphysical characteristics. The necessity to reduce the variability of naturally occurring aerosols to typical cases, but without neglecting possible fluctuations, is achieved in OPAC by the use of a dataset of typical internally mixed aerosol components. In addition, any mixtures of the basic components can be used to calculate the overall optical parameters. Experimental or modeled meteorological profiles (temperature, pressure, relative humidity) in complementary to experimental lidar data are used to calculate the solutions of lidar equation that fits, in an iterative manner, to the output of the model. Two type of uncertainties are diminished in this way: first, the modeled profiles of lidar ratio are used in lidar data processing instead of a constant value; second, aerosol height profiles are no longer being assumed in the model, but directly measured. This procedure was applied to synthetic lidar signals in order to test its advantages and limitation.",,,,,"Talianu, Camelia/E-6735-2011; Radu, Cristian M/R-5268-2018; Nicolae, Doina/I-4999-2016","Stefan, Sabina/0000-0002-1948-8566",,,,,,,,,,,,,0277-786X,1996-756X,978-0-8194-6908-3,,,,2007,6750,,,,,,,,67500H,10.1117/12.737900,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.737900,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000252771400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using laboratory bioassays, we studied how planktonic bacteria may modify kairomone activity. We measured the amplitude of diel vertical migration (DVM) of Daphnia pulex DE GEER among treatments with different amounts of bacteria. We used temperature incubation to increase bacterial densities and filtration to reduce abundance. Daphnids exposed to fish cue (F) and filtrate of fish cue (FF) (i. e. 3.0 fold decrease in the planktonic bacteria) exhibited a strong DVM response. In addition, the strength of the response remained the same for both treatments. However, daphnids exposed to an incubated fish cue (IF), which had higher bacterial densities, showed similar migration to daphnids in the control treatment. This IF treatment showed a 3-fold enrichment of bacteria. Besides observing a gradient in DVM response with bacterial density, we also found that DVM response varied seasonally in our experiments. DVM response to fish cue developed quickly in the experiments carried out in March and May compared to a delayed response that we observed in a similar experiment in January. A seasonal shift also occurred in the population sizes of cultivable planktonic bacteria. Responsiveness of D. pulex to predator cues may vary seasonally, possibly due to higher vulnerability during seasons with high fish production. Kairomone concentrations may also fluctuate due to varied release or degradation rates. Our results suggest that the in-situ, tight coupling between production and degradation of kairomone appears to be the cause of DVM response for daphnids during summer.",,,,,"Gozen, Ayse Gul/AAC-3952-2019; beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020","Gozen, Ayse Gul/0000-0001-5479-051X; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-9136,,,,,JAN,2006,165,1,,,,,89,104,,10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0165-0089,http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0165-0089,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000235113100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the lightweight steel framing (LSF) construction system has been progressively assuming a relevant position in the residential sector. Since LSF is not the traditional construction system, the indoor thermal environment of these buildings has not been widely studied and discussed considering the southern European climate context. The low thermal inertia of this construction system is commonly pointed to as a possible weakness in warmer climates. The present work aims to address this research gap by evaluating and comparing the LSF and masonry construction systems in terms of the indoor thermal environment focusing on the level of thermal inertia. The considered methodology lies in a long-term experimental campaign based on the construction and monitoring of two identical experimental test cells, differing only in the construction system. The test cells are in the central region of Portugal. The monitoring period elapsed over an entire year. Dynamic simulations are also carried out with a model experimentally validated to consider a wider range of climatic conditions. It is shown that internally insulating the ground floor has an impact on the indoor thermal environment of the LSF test cell by accentuating the indoor air temperature fluctuations and magnitude of the extreme peak values. However, the results also reveal that the faster and closer response to the outdoor conditions may be beneficial for LSF buildings during the heating season.",,,,,"Ferreira, Victor/H-3759-2013; Vicente, Romeu/G-6244-2011","Ferreira, Victor/0000-0002-6295-1333; Vicente, Romeu/0000-0002-5456-1642",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,MAY,2022,15,9,,,,,,,3061,10.3390/en15093061,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15093061,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000795401300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We hypothesized that adaptation to soil environmental conditions may contribute to the variation observed, and this was examined by characterization of different microbial community attributes under a range of soil conditions. Soil was sampled from no-till and chisel-tilled fields within a long-term experiment in eastern Washington during growth of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum). The range of soil environmental conditions covered was extended by amendment of crop residues. Soil samples were characterized with respect to biomass N and biomass P, substrate utilization dynamics, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and whole-soil fatty acid (MIDI-FA) profiles, and with respect to soil environmental variables (bulk density, soil organic C [SOC], temperature, moisture, and inorganic N and P). Bacterial and fungal lipid biomarkers were negatively correlated (P < 0.001), confirming that these subsets of fatty acids are associated with contrasting components of the microbial biomass. Biomass N was closely associated with soil conditions, notably N availability. The proportion of substrates used with no apparent lag phase decreased during summer and was negatively correlated with lipid stress indicators. Cyclopropyl fatty acids accounted for more than 60% of the variation in bacteria] PLFA. These observations suggest that adaptation to environmental stresses was partly responsible for the microbial dynamics observed. Tillage practice had little effect on the relationships between soil conditions and microbiological properties.

Revegetation of boreal forest lands disturbed by surface mining for bitumen can be challenging due to fluctuating levels of soil NaCl and harsh winter temperatures. These stressors may hinder the growth and survival of planted tree seedlings. Two experiments were carried out to examine the processes of recovery from NaCl stress and overwintering in trembling aspen, tamarack, and white spruce seedlings. In the recovery experiment, seedlings were treated with 0, 50, or 100 mM NaCl for 60 days and then allowed to recover for 60 days. Most of the examined physiological variables (total dry weight, chlorophyll concentration, photosynthesis, and transpiration) in all examined species returned to control levels after 30 days of recovery from the NaCl treatment. In the overwintering experiment, seedlings were subjected to 0 or 50 mM NaCl treatment throughout the first growing season, overwintered, and treated with 0, 50, or 100 mM NaCl for 8 weeks during the second growing season. All tested species exhibited foliar chlorosis and necrosis from NaCl treatment in the first year. Several similarities were observed between species in both experiments, including increased foliar K and necrosis in trembling aspen and tamarack. Trembling aspen exhibited remarkably low foliar Na, whereas tamarack and white spruce had high concentrations of foliar Na despite the recovery of physiological variables to control levels.

Methods: In in vitro experiments, bone marrow mononuclear cells and THP-1-derived cells were used to evaluate the viability of AVI treatment. Besides, the quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were adopted to explore the protective effect of AVI on LPS-induced inflammation. For in vivo work, the effect of AVI on mice was evaluated by using both CLP-induced and the LPS-induced sepsis mice model. The fluctuation of anal temperature and the behavior of mice were recorded after surgery. Further, the content of bacteria in peritoneal lavage fluid was detected, as well as the levels of ALT, AST, LD and LDH in serum with ELISA. H&E staining and realtime PCR were used to evaluate the histopathology of liver, spleen and lung. Finally, relevant signaling pathways were detected by Western blot, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.Results: AVI inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors in both CLP-induced and LPS-induced sepsis mice models, and reduced the number of bacteria in abdominal lavage fluid. The preventive treatment with AVI alleviated sepsis-induced organ injuries, reduced inflammatory responses, which was through inhibiting Hippo and Rho signaling pathway.Conclusions: This study indicated that AVI effectively protected mice from sepsis by down-regulating the activation of Hippo signaling and Rho family, and reducing inflammation and organ damage.

This toy model is based on a generalised `chaotic tent map', which may be considered as the compound result of a positive and a negative feedback mechanism, and involves two degrees of freedom. The model is not a realistic representation of a climatic system, but rather a radical simplification of real climatic dynamics. However, its simplicity helps understand the physical mechanisms that cause the scaling behaviour and simultaneously enables easy implementation and convenient experimentation. Application of the toy model gives traces that can resemble historical time series of hydroclimatic variables, such as temperature and river flow. In particular, such traces exhibit scaling behaviour with a Hurst coefficient greater than 0.5 and their statistical properties are similar to that of observed time series. Moreover, application demonstrates that large-scale synthetic `climatic' fluctuations (like upward or downward trends) can emerge without any specific reason and their evolution is unpredictable, even when they are generated by this simple fully deterministic model with only two degrees of freedom. Thus, the model emphasises the large uncertainty associated with the scaling behaviour, rather than enhances the prediction capability, despite the simple deterministic dynamics it uses, which obviously, are only a caricature of the much more complex dynamics of the real climatic system.

The spatial distribution of net water input to the soil-topography system is mediated by vegetation patterns through the processes of interception, evapotranspiration and snowmelt. We have previously described RHESSys, a distributed model of water and carbon flux with a prescribed canopy cover. Although the canopy structure varied spatially it did not change through time. We present an expanded model in which carbon and nitrogen are dynamically coupled with distributed hydrology. The model fixes and allocates canopy carbon annually to reflect changes in climate forcing. We test the interactions of the forest ecosystem to distributed hydrology through controlled experiments. In the first experiment, we prescribe canopy cover and examine the sensitivity of the hydrological outputs to the distribution of vegetation. The canopy distribution is found to have significant effects on simulated hydrological outputs where evaporative demand exceeds available water. In a second experiment we simulate the canopy leaf area index (LAI) across the topography and through time. The model is executed over 100 years using repeated 10-year meteorological records to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of LAI. Annual precipitation and temperature differences result in temporally fluctuating LAI about a reasonably stable long-term mean. The topographical position has a strong effect on local forest canopy characteristics. As expected, simulated ecosystem processes are found to be sensitive to rooting depth in more water limited environments.

Synchronous dynamics can amplify the destabilizing effect of environmental variability on ecosystem functions such as productivity, whereas the inverse, compensatory dynamics, can stabilize function. Here we combine simulation and empirical analyses to elucidate mechanisms that underlie patterns of synchronous versus compensatory dynamics. In both simulated and empirical communities, we show that synchronous and compensatory dynamics are not mutually exclusive but instead can vary by timescale. Our simulations identify multiple mechanisms that can generate timescale-specific patterns, including different environmental drivers, diverse life histories, dispersal, and non-stationary dynamics. We find that traditional metrics for quantifying synchronous dynamics are often biased toward long-term drivers and may miss the importance of short-term drivers.

Using modern information technology to solve the deficiencies of live animal centralized transport is of great significance for the stable development of animal husbandry. In this paper, the wearable multi-sensor system was specially designed, and the system test experiment and transport monitoring experiment were carried out. According to the continuous and real-time data of environmental and physiological parameters obtained from the transport monitoring experiment, the optimization extraction, data collection analysis, correlation analysis and simulation analysis of the internal environment in the carriage were carried out, and the prediction model between environmental and physiological parameters based on generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and the prediction model of comfort and health evaluation based on back propagation neural network (BPNN) were established. The results show that: (1) The wearable multi-sensor system had high accuracy and stability of data collection, and the power consumption and communication performance can meet the monitoring requirements. (2) The observation values of internal environmental parameters increased gradually with the accumulation of transport time, and finally reached the state of dynamic balance. The heart rate fluctuated greatly and was higher than the normal range. The blood oxygen saturation showed a gradual decrease trend, but the overall was in the normal range. The body temperature gradually increased, and was affected by discomfort. (3) The correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between environmental and physiological parameters. (4) The area with larger value of environmental parameters was close to the middle and front of the carriage, which was mainly caused by the high density and poor air circulation. (5) The prediction model between environmental and physiological parameters based on GRNN and the prediction model of comfort and health evaluation based on BPNN had high prediction accuracy, and the combination of the two models can map the impact of environmental factors on the change of vital signs to the relationship between comfort and health. Therefore, in the case of unknown vital signs information, only obtaining environmental information can also predict the health levels, which can provide decision-making basis for relevant practitioners.",,,,,"Zhang, Mengjie/AAT-8675-2021","ZHANG, Xiaoshuan/0000-0002-0395-928X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1699,1872-7107,,,,SEP,2020,176,,,,,,,,105632,10.1016/j.compag.2020.105632,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.105632,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000568762500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We report here the transport of suspended sediment and solutes during the snowmelt period in a small experimental catchment in the subalpine belt of the Central Spanish Pyrenees. The seasonality of hydrological and sediment responses throughout the year was investigated using daily data of discharge, suspended sediment transport and solute outputs of the hydrological years 2003/2004 and 2005/2006. The study demonstrated the importance of the snowmelt period in terms of runoff production, and solute and suspended sediment yield: whereas precipitation during the snowmelt period (2-2.5 months) represented 10-13% of annual precipitation, discharge and suspended sediment transport accounted for up to 50% and 60%, respectively, and solute output approximately 40-50%. Solute transport dominated throughout the snowmelt period, whereas suspended sediment transport mostly occurred during the second phase of the snowmelt period (June), when an expanding area of the catchment was free from snow. The moderate daily increases in discharge, which were related to day night temperature fluctuations, were insufficient to transport bedload material. Hourly data were used for preliminary assessment of the relationships among discharge, suspended sediment, and solute concentration, which provided insights into sediment sources and delivery mechanisms. Thus, during snowmelt-related events, the sediment mobilized was most probably derived from areas near or within the channel. In contrast, during events involving both snowmelt and rainfall, the gully system near the divide contributed to sediment load. The solute concentration was inversely related to water discharge, with higher concentrations during the first half of the snowmelt period (May) than during the second half (June). The results of this study demonstrate the key role of snow accumulation and melting processes in controlling the hydrological dynamics and patterns of particulate and solute mobilization in high-mountain environments. Future changes in snow volume and duration will affect the timing of snowmelt-related spring high flows, as well as soil erosion and transport.",,,,,"Lana-Renault, Noemí/L-1913-2014; García-Ruiz, José M./D-4535-2012","Lana-Renault, Noemí/0000-0002-0272-2504; Garcia-Ruiz, Jose Maria/0000-0002-8535-817X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1523-0430,1938-4246,,,,MAY,2011,43,2,,,,,213,222,,10.1657/1938-4246-43.2.213,http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-43.2.213,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000291118700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study addresses the dynamics of the wind-driven sea level variation around Antarctica. A realistic barotropic numerical model reproduced well the observed sea level around Antarctica. From numerical model experiments, the authors demonstrate that the forcing responsible for the coastal sea level is the wind stress at the coastal boundary. Both the dominant coherent signal and westward propagating signals are identified in the model, and these signals are trapped over the shelf and slope around Antarctica. As a mechanism of these trapped signals, the authors consider analytical solutions of the oceanic response to alongshore wind stress over the shelf and slope in the circumpolar domain. In these solutions, besides the shelf wave mode, a wavenumber-zero mode appears and characterizes the coastal dynamics around Antarctica. At periods from 10 to 200 days, the coherent sea level can be explained quantitatively by the solution of this wavenumber-zero mode with a 5-10-day damping time scale. The spectral peaks of the westward propagating signals can be explained by the resonance of the shelf wave mode. The wavenumber-zero mode can respond to the wavenumber-zero forcing at any frequency and the degree of response increases with decreasing frequency. In addition, the wavenumber-zero component of wind stress, corresponding to the AAO variation, is a dominant forcing. Therefore, the coherent sea level variation around Antarctica is preferably generated and becomes a dominant feature in the circumpolar domain, particularly at lower frequencies.",,,,,"Ohshima, Kay I/D-6909-2012","Kusahara, Kazuya/0000-0003-4067-7959",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,,,,,MAR,2009,39,3,,,,,658,674,,10.1175/2008JPO3982.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2008JPO3982.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000265104200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The genus is almost worldwide in distribution, on tropical and temperate shores, with currently over twenty recognised species. The majority of members of this genus commonly occur in the middle and upper intertidal. At the global scale (1000s km), the four currently recognised informal groups of Chthamalus exhibit a regional endemicity that has probably resulted from tectonic events during the last 70-90 Ma. The 'challengeri' and 'fissus' groups are thought to be the most ancestral within Chthamalus. Their extant distributions derive from the late Cretaceous. The 'malayensis' and 'stellatus' groups are assumed to be more derived and are probably sister taxa. The latter two groups exhibit overlap with the apparently more ancient 'challengeri' and 'fissus' groups. Abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, desiccation, aspect, winds and fetch) together with biotic factors (e.g. supply-side) all affect the distribution of Chthamalus species at regional (100s km) and local (1-10s km) scales. The relationship between these factors and Chthamalus distributions has best been studied in the north-east Atlantic species C. stellatus and C. montagui and to a lesser extent in the western Atlantic species C. fragilis. Microhabitat (within shore) patterns of distribution in Chthamalus barnacles are controlled by biotic (e.g. supply-side, competition, predation and grazer/algal interactions) and abiotic (e.g. shading and run-off) factors. The highly fluctuating temperatures and desiccation stress that Chthamalus species experience when aerially exposed at low tide appear to have a major deterministic effect on species distributions, often limiting the vertical distribution of Chthamalus species on the shore. On sheltered shores, the abiotic stress due to minimal wave splash may be more important than biotic factors, while on moderately exposed and exposed shores, that can be supplied with many propagules and where density-dependent factors come into play, biotic factors may be more important. Abiotic factors may also scale up to explain large scale patterns of distribution, such as trends in Chthamalus abundance between NE and SE Atlantic coasts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

An experiment using stratified litterbags, containing organic material of four degradation stages (fresh litter, litter, fragmented litter and humus) was performed over a period of 2.5 years. Dynamics and stratification of fluorescent stained bacteria and fungi, ratios between bacterial and fungal biomass, and relationships with moisture and temperature are described. Average bacterial counts in litter and fragmented litter were similar, i.e., approximately 5 x 10(9) bacteria g(-1) (dry weight) organic matter, and significantly exceeded those in humus. The mean bacterial biomass ranged from 0.338 to 0.252 mg carbon (C) g(-1) (dry weight) organic matter. Lengths of mycelia were significantly below the usually recorded amounts for comparable temperate coniferous forests. The highest average hyphal length, 53 m g(-1) (dry weight) organic matter, was recorded in litter and decreased significantly with depth. The corresponding mean fungal biomass ranged from 0.050 to 0.009 mg C g(-1) (dry weight). The abundance of bacteria and fungi was influenced by water content, that of fungi also by temperature. A litterbag series with freshly fallen Litter of standard quality, renewed bimonthly, revealed a clear seasonal pattern with microbial biomass peaks in winter. The mean hyphal length was 104 m g(-1) (dry weight) and mean number of bacteria, 2.40 x 10(9) bacteria g(-1) (dry weight). Comparable bacterial and fungal biomass C were found in the freshly fallen litter [0.154 and 0.132 mg C g(-1) (dry weight) organic material, respectively]. The ratio of bacterial-to-fungal biomass C increased from 1.2 in fresh litter to 28.0 in humus. The results indicate the existence of an environmental stress factor affecting the abundance of fungi in the second phase of decomposition. High atmospheric nitrogen deposition is discussed as a prime factor to explain low fungal biomass and the relatively short lengths of fungal hyphae in some of the forest soil layers under study.",,,,,,"Berg, Matty P./0000-0001-8442-8503",,,,,,,,,,,,,0178-2762,,,,,MAR,1998,26,4,,,,,313,322,,10.1007/s003740050382,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003740050382,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000073278400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Almost yearly recurring fires progressively devastate clear-cut PSFs. The need for both conservation and active restoration together with the appropriate information on the techniques and species is urgent. The aim of this study was to find native PSF species that are suitable for reforestation in the open degraded peatlands. We established two planting experiments in degraded peat areas with 21 tree species to study the survival and growth in relation to environmental factors for 2 years. The study sites were located in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia in the degraded peatland of the Ex-Mega Rice area and along the degraded margins of the river Sabangau. Seed material collected from local forests was grown in a field nursery and planted 6-11 months later in the field. Growth and mortality of the seedlings and environmental variables (water table, temperature) were monitored frequently for two years. The effects of the environmental variables on growth were tested with mixed-effects models and on mortality with Cox regression. As a result, we could derive species-specific information of the seedlings' early stage ecology and suitability for restoration. The most promising species based on the analysis were Shorea balangeran, Adenanthera pavonina, Dacryodes rostrata and Lithocarpus dasystachys. The comparison of the two differing areas revealed contrasting challenges: the main obstacle for reforestation in the Ex-Mega Rice area was fire, whereas in the river margin extreme water table fluctuation limited the success of the seedlings.

However, changes in biodiversity occur in real-world ecosystems with varying environments and a dynamic community composition. In this theme issue, we present novel research on BEF in such dynamic communities. The contributions are organized in three sections on BEF relationships in (i) multi-trophic diversity, (ii) non-equilibrium biodiversity under disturbance and varying environmental conditions, and (iii) large spatial and long temporal scales. The first section shows that multi-trophic BEF relationships often appear idiosyncratic, while accounting for species traits enables a predictive understanding. Future BEF research on complex communities needs to include ecological theory that is based on first principles of species-averaged body masses, stoichiometry and effects of environmental conditions such as temperature. The second section illustrates that disturbance and varying environments have direct as well as indirect (via changes in species richness, community composition and species' traits) effects on BEF relationships. Fluctuations in biodiversity (species richness, community composition and also trait dominance within species) can severely modify BEF relationships. The third section demonstrates that BEF at larger spatial scales is driven by different variables. While species richness per se and community biomass are most important, species identity effects and community composition are less important than at small scales. Across long temporal scales, mass extinctions represent severe changes in biodiversity with mixed effects on ecosystem functions. Together, the contributions of this theme issue identify new research frontiers and answer some open questions on BEF relationships in dynamic communities of real-world landscapes.",,,,,"Brose, Ulrich/AAT-7547-2020; Hillebrand, Helmut/I-1717-2014","Brose, Ulrich/0000-0001-9156-583X; Hillebrand, Helmut/0000-0001-7449-1613",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8436,1471-2970,,,,MAY 19,2016,371,1694,,,,,,,20150267,10.1098/rstb.2015.0267,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2015.0267,,,,,,,,27114570,,,,,WOS:000375896500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main questions of interest can be summarized as follows: How is the selection of larvae achieved in their respective communities ? What are the origins of year to year fluctuations? How can the structure and functioning of a life-cycle be understood? In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach to the above questions based on several global strategies: (1) the analysis of the physical features of water masses: currents and hydroclimatic parameters:, (2) the use of an autoecological view point; (3) the development of laboratory experiments and (4) the use of comparative biology based on latitudinal transects. The control of dissemination and return to the area inhabited by adults was achieved by Mediterranean E. nebulosa by means of egg-masses. These structures per mit the coexistence of selective requirements in terms of size and shape of sediment grains - which define a large potential zone for larval settlement - with a spatially limited area of adult distribution. Some important consequences, like the homogeneization of size range of E. nebulosa juveniles during the first benthic stages, emerged from the adjustment of biological and hydroclimatic events. To conclude, we propose a hypothesis to explain the year to year variability of benthic recruitment, together with a diagram of the processes involved using the following parameters: temperature patterns during the spawning period, distribution of egg-masses (number and date of appearance), number of larvae per egg-mass, and patterns of larval release from the egg-masses.",,,,,"Martin, Daniel/G-5232-2010","Martin, Daniel/0000-0001-6350-7384",,,,,,,,,,,,,0214-8358,,,,,DEC,1995,59,,,1,,,103,117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995TY23000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experiment was conducted in replicate continuous flow coral reef mesocosms flushed with unfiltered sea water from Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. Mesocosms were located in full sunlight and experienced diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in temperature and sea water chemistry characteristic of the adjacent reef flat. Treatment mesocosms were manipulated to simulate an increase in pCO(2) to levels expected in this century [midday pCO(2) levels exceeding control mesocosms by 365 +/- 130 mu atm (mean +/- sd)]. Acidification had a profound impact on the development and growth of crustose coralline algae (CCA) populations. During the experiment, CCA developed 25% cover in the control mesocosms and only 4% in the acidified mesocosms, representing an 86% relative reduction. Free-living associations of CCA known as rhodoliths living in the control mesocosms grew at a rate of 0.6 g buoyant weight year(-1) while those in the acidified experimental treatment decreased in weight at a rate of 0.9 g buoyant weight year(-1), representing a 250% difference. CCA play an important role in the growth and stabilization of carbonate reefs, so future changes of this magnitude could greatly impact coral reefs throughout the world. Coral calcification decreased between 15% and 20% under acidified conditions. Linear extension decreased by 14% under acidified conditions in one experiment.

Here, we document effects of a sudden, complete loss of the entire snow cover on first-year sea ice at Kangerlussuaq Fjord, West Greenland, due to a natural Fohn wind event that caused a ca. 17 degrees C air temperature increase over 36 h. We applied Imaging-PAM fluorometry to examine effects of snow cover on algal distribution and photobiology and observed a rapid decrease in algal biomass associated with loss of the skeletal ice crystal layer on the underside of the ice that had supported most of the visible algae. Furthermore, the remaining algae were photobiologically stressed, as seen in a significant decrease in the dark-acclimated fluorescence yield (Phi(PSII_max)) from 0.55 before snow loss to 0.41 after. However, recovery in the dark suggested that non-photosynthetic quenching was successfully dissipating excess energy in the community and that there was little photodamage. An observed decrease in the photosynthetic efficiency alpha from 0.22 to 0.16 mu mol e m(-2) s(-1) is therefore likely to be due to photoacclimation and the change in community composition. Centric diatoms and flagellates were the main taxa lost in the snow loss event, whereas the sea ice specialist Nitzschia frigida increased in numbers.

Experiments were conducted with artificial rainfall and a wind tunnel to determine the temporal and spatial dispersal pattern of the species and the relationship with rain and wind. The population fluctuations of A. chrysantha observed during 2006-2009 could be explained by the rainfall amount and seasonal distribution, which in turn influenced the production of achenes. This study demonstrated the formation of a seasonal aerial seed bank that remains on the dead plant from the fruiting period (early summer) to late spring. We experimentally demonstrated that rain was necessary to release the achenes from the capitula (ombrohydrochory), with wind having no effect on dispersal. The pattern of achene release was related to rainfall events. The main timing of dispersal was during autumn, decreasing the aerial bank by around 80% by December. However, in March, when the next cohort was flowering, some achenes still remained on old capitula (up to 1700 achenes per m(2) in some years). White non-dormant achenes were first released, and dark dormant achenes were released later. The non-dormant achenes on the soil surface could germinate quickly (2 d) after receiving a minimum of 10 mm of rainfall at autumn temperatures. Most achenes dispersed across very short distances (atelechory): 75% of them landed beneath the plant canopy and only 7% landed >30 cm from the canopy edge.

We conducted laboratory experiments to quantify burrow oxygen dynamics and increased oxygen demand resulting from burrow irrigation using two different year classes of Hexagenia spp. nymphs from western Lake Erie during summer, 2006. Using oxygen microelectrodes and hot film anemometry, we simultaneously determined oxygen concentrations and burrow water flow velocities. Burrow oxygen depletion rates ranged from 21.7 mg/nymph/mo for 15 mm nymphs at 23 degrees C to 240.7 mg/nymph/mo for 23 mm nymphs at 13 degrees C. Sealed microcosm experiments demonstrated that mayflies increase the rate of oxygen depletion by 2-5 times that of controls, depending on size of nymph and water temperature, with colder waters having greater impact. At natural population densities, nymph pumping activity increased total sediment oxygen demand 0.3-2.5 times compared to sediments with no mayflies and accounted for 22-71% of the total sediment oxygen demand. Extrapolating laboratory results to the natural system suggest that Hexagenia spp. populations may exert a significant control on oxygen depletion during intermittent stratification. This finding may help explain some of the fluctuations in Hexagenia spp. population densities in western Lake Erie and suggests that mayflies, by causing their own population collapse irrespective of other environmental conditions, may need longer term averages when used as a bio-indicator of the success of pollution-abatement programs in western Lake Erie and possibly throughout the Great Lakes.

Crimson Seedless grafted onto Paulsen 1103 (V. berlandieri R. x V. rupestres du Lot). Vines were irrigated (from April to October) above their full crop water requirements (110% of crop evapotranspiration, ETc) in order to obtain non-limiting soil water conditions. The reference equations obtained for MDS and psi(s) with meteorological factors differed between the pre and post-veraison periods. Before veraison, MDS was the most reliable indicator for assessing the water status of vines, whereas psi(s) correlated better with meteorological variables after veraison. The sensitivity of MDS to ascertain the plant water status decreased during post-veraison due to its dependence on growth and to daily fluctuation of stem diameter. Moreover, it can also be induced by changes in the transpiration and also on the accumulation of xylem abscisic acid ([ABA](xylem)). Mean temperature (T-m) was the environmental variable that best correlated with MDS and psi(s) at pre-veraison. However, post-veraison reference lines can be obtained for MDS and psi(s) using reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and mean daily vapour pressure deficit (VPDm). The use of MDS signal intensity (SIMDS) around the unity and psi(s) around -0.65 MPa were the best criteria for irrigation scheduling in well-irrigated 'Crimson Seedless' table grapes growing in a semiarid climate of south-eastern Spain, during pre and post-veraison periods, respectively.

Instrumental records provide a reliable representation of IOD behavior since 1958, while coral reconstructions currently extend the IOD history back to 1846. Large fluctuations in the number and intensity of positive IOD events over time are evident in these records, but it is unclear to what extent this represents multidecadal modulation of the IOD or an anthropogenically forced change in IOD behavior. In this study we explore the suitability of coral records from single-site locations in the equatorial Indian Ocean for capturing information about the occurrence and magnitude of positive IOD (pIOD) events. We find that the optimum location for coral reconstructions of the IOD occurs in the southeastern equatorial Indian Ocean, along the coast of Java and Sumatra between similar to 3 and 7 degrees S. Here the strong ocean cooling and atmospheric drying during pIOD events are unambiguously recorded in coral oxygen isotope records, which capture up to 50% of IOD variance. Unforced experiments with coupled climate models suggest that potential biases in coral estimates of pIOD frequency are skewed toward overestimating pIOD recurrence intervals and become larger with shorter reconstruction windows and longer pIOD recurrence times. Model output also supports the assumption of stationarity in sea surface temperature relationships in the optimum IOD location that is necessary for paleoclimate reconstructions. This study provides a targeted framework for the future generation of paleoclimate records, including optimized coral reconstructions of past IOD variability.",,,,,"Abram, Nerilie/AAT-5171-2021; Gagan, Michael/L-5014-2018; Phipps, Steven J/B-3135-2008","Gagan, Michael/0000-0002-8279-323X; Phipps, Steven J/0000-0001-5657-8782; Abram, Nerilie/0000-0003-1246-2344",,,,,,,,,,,,,0883-8305,1944-9186,,,,OCT,2015,30,10,,,,,1391,1405,,10.1002/2015PA002810,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015PA002810,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000366061400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, long-term climate experiments in natural vegetation are rare and largely confined to systems with the capacity for rapid compositional change. In unproductive, grazed grassland at Buxton in northern England (U.K.), one of the longest running experimental manipulations of temperature and rainfall reveals vegetation highly resistant to climate shifts maintained over 13 yr. Here we document this resistance in the form of: (i) constancy in the relative abundance of growth forms and maintained dominance by long-lived, slow-growing grasses, sedges, and small forbs; (it) immediate but minor shifts in the abundance of several species that have remained stable over the course of the experiment; (fit) no change in productivity in response to climate treatments with the exception of reduction from chronic summer drought; and (iv) only minor species losses in response to drought and winter heating. Overall, compositional changes induced by 13-yr exposure to climate regime change were less than short-term fluctuations in species abundances driven by interannual climate fluctuations. The lack of progressive compositional change, coupled with the long-term historical persistence of unproductive grasslands in northern England, suggests the community at Buxton possesses a stabilizing capacity that leads to long-term persistence of dominant species. Unproductive ecosystems provide a refuge for many threatened plants and animals and perform a diversity of ecosystem services.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the characteristics and maintenance process of baroclinicity near the KE. In this paper, numerical experiments are designed and high-resolution ERA-Interim data are used to study the response characteristics and maintenance of atmospheric baroclinicity to KE meso-scale SSTA Front (KMSTF) associated with KE decadal variability (KEDV-induced SSTA). The results suggest that the response of atmospheric surface baroclinicity to KMSTF is distributed southward due to advection process compared with distribution of KMSTF. The response of surface sensible heat flux is distributed to northward compared with distribution of KMSTF. The difference in the phase between atmospheric surface temperature and KMSTF is the main reason for its distribution to the northward. Cumulus convection, vertical heat transfer and submonthly fluctuations transferring the heat flux to polar weaken the surface baroclinicity, and sensible heat flux heating strengthen the surface baroclinicity. Studying the troposphere baroclinicity, it is found that the baroclinicity is distributed northward with height, and the large value is near the top of the boundary layer. Meridional convergence of fluctuations flux formed by cumulus momentum redistribution is the main contribution. The low SLP can trigger cumulus convection process, which causes the clockwise secondary circulation in altitude-latitude sections transfering heat, water vapor and momentum to polar. That is the main reason why the baroclinicity distribute to northward with height. In addition, it is also found that the diabatic heating induced by cumulus convection causes the upper jet to shift northward through fluctuations thermal effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-5733,,,,,JAN,2021,64,1,,,,,67,86,,10.6038/cjg2021O0168,http://dx.doi.org/10.6038/cjg2021O0168,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000604835800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methane emissions were measured by a closed chamber method, in rice plots at three locations (Suwon, Iksan, and Milyang) with the single rice cropping system. All experimental data from 5 years of study were summarized and used for calculating nation-wide CH4 emissions. Temperature, soil type, cultural practices, water management, organic matter management, and cultivar selection significantly affected the fluctuations of CH4 emissions. The two most promising mitigation options for reducing emissions were altered water management, in particular mid-season aeration by short-term drainage, and improved organic matter management, by promotion of aerobic degradation through composing or soil incorporation. Annual total CH4 emission in Korea changed from 410 Gg in 1990 to 339 Gg in 2000, due mainly to a decrease in the cultivated area of paddy rice. If we convert annual CH4 emission to Global Warming Potential as CO2 equivalent, it amounts to 7.1M CO2 t yr(-1) of greenhouse gas emitted to the atmosphere in 2000 from-the rice fields in Korea, which is just 5.3% of the annual CO2 emission from the industry and energy sector.

By combining active and passive rheology experiments, performed on the same micro-bead bound to the actin network through membrane adhesive receptors, we measure the auto-correlation function C-ff(tau) of the average force pulling on the bead. As for any out-of-equilibrium system, the force distribution differs from the thermodynamical equilibrium one, especially at long time scale tau greater than or similar to 1 s where the bead motion becomes partially directed. Thus the fluctuation-dissipation theorem does not apply and one can measure the distance from equilibrium through its violation. We investigate the influence of different parameters on the force distribution, focusing particularly on the role of ligand density: a detailed study shows how the amplitude of active forces increases when the bead is more tightly attached to the cortex. We introduce and study a model, which takes into account the number of bonds between the bead and the cytoskeleton, as well as the viscoelastic properties of the medium. This model faithfully accounts for the experimental observations. Also, it is shown that the amplitude of active forces increases with temperature. Finally, our data confirm that ATP depletion in the cell, or partial inhibition of the actomyosin activity, leads to a decrease of the amplitude of the force distribution.

However, the physiological traits mediating such variation in relative fitness have rarely been identified. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is tightly associated with life history strategies, thermoregulation, diet use, and inhabited latitude and could therefore moderate differences in fitness responses to fluctuations in local environments, particularly when species have adapted to different climates in allopatry. We work in a long-term study of collared (Ficedula albicollis) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) in a recent hybrid zone located on the Swedish island of Oland in the Baltic Sea. Here, we explore whether differences in RMR match changes in relative performance of growing flycatcher nestlings across environmental conditions using an experimental approach. The fitness of pied flycatchers has previously been shown to be less sensitive to the mismatch between the peak in food abundance and nestling growth among late breeders. Here, we find that pied flycatcher nestlings have lower RMR in response to higher ambient temperatures (associated with low food availability). We also find that experimentally relaxed nestling competition is associated with an increased RMR in this species. In contrast, collared flycatcher nestlings did not vary their RMR in response to these environmental factors. Our results suggest that a more flexible nestling RMR in pied flycatchers is responsible for the better adaptation of pied flycatchers to the typical seasonal changes in food availability experienced in this hybrid zone. Generally, subtle physiological differences that have evolved when species were in allopatry may play an important role to patterns of competition, coexistence, or displacements between closely related species in secondary contact.",,,,,"Ålund, Murielle/Q-2996-2019","Ålund, Murielle/0000-0003-2861-9721; Sirkia, Paivi Maria/0000-0003-0346-6298; Qvarnstrom, Anna/0000-0002-1178-4053",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,MAY,2018,8,9,,,,,4575,4586,,10.1002/ece3.3987,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3987,,,,,,,,29760898,,,,,WOS:000431987300020,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, limitations of existing theory have hindered empirical applications: the need for detailed mathematical analysis whenever the study system requires a new model, and restricted theory for structured populations. We present a new approach that overcomes both these limitations. We show how temporal storage effect can be quantified by Monte Carlo simulations in a wide range of models for competing species. We use the lottery model and a generic integral projection model (IPM) to introduce ideas, and present two empirical applications: (1) algal species in a chemostat with variable temperature, showing that the storage effect can operate without a long-lived life stage and (2) a sagebrush steppe community IPM.

It is shown that under certain assumptions of an 'ideal' climate model the first problem to be solved is the problem of the stability of the attractor of this model to perturbations of forcing. Using the barotropic model of the atmosphere as an example, we discuss the theory of the atmosphere response to perturbations of forcing, which relates the response operator of the system and the statistical characteristics of its solution (applicability of fluctuation-dissipation relations is proved). It is shown that under certain conditions the maximum response of the system (for given a perturbation norm) is close in structure to the first natural orthogonal function (NOF) of the low-frequency variability of atmospheric circulation. We give the results of analysis of observational data. They show that an increase in winter average temperature in Northern hemisphere in the past decades is due to a change in circulation in the middle latitudes, and the basic contribution to this change is made by the first NOF. We analyse the physical excitation mechanisms of the main NOFs of the low-frequency variability of atmospheric circulation. In the concluding section of the paper we analyse the results of numerical experiments on the atmosphere general circulation model developed at the Institute of Numerical Mathematics, Russian Academy of Sciences (INM RAS).

Mussel sampling was performed on a monthly basis from October 2002 to August 2003, in conjunction with monitoring of hydrobiological parameters. Environmental parameters varied over a broad range and their fluctuations showed a similar pattern at the three depths studied (0, 1 and 3 m). Seston quantity (total particulate matter, TPM) ranged between 2.7 and 14.95 mg l(-1), whereas the percentage organic matter in the TPM varied between 11.56% (November 2002) and 60.98% (August 2003). Growth results showed that mussels developed from bay seed maintained a greater length than those from open waters from October 2002 to February 2003, but there were no differences in length between both groups from March 2003 until the end of the experiment. Although there was no significant difference in final length for the two seed sources, better performance was observed for bay seed with respect to weight (both shells and soft tissues) and mortality. There was no correlation between the seasonal pattern of mussel growth in Fangar Bay and primary production, temperature or seston, probably due to the wide-ranging variation of these parameters. Seasonal growth patterns were coincident between shell and soft tissues, with the exception of August, when shell weight was maintained and flesh weight diminished. The results of yield in weight and mortality obtained in this study showed the benefits of using mussel seed from the same area where the cultures are carried out. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, mosses experience significant shifts in their moisture status due to daily and yearly fluctuations in sunlight, temperature and precipitation. While the effects of drying and rewetting on nutrient leaching and photosynthesis in mosses have been studied, no attempt has been made to assess the consequences for N-2 fixation in feather mosses. We conducted an experiment in which we dried (3 day at 28 A degrees C; < 9 % of field moisture) and rewetted samples of the feather moss Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt. that is colonized by N-2-fixing-cyanobacteria to assess the influence on N-2 fixation. Further, we tested how long it takes for N-2 fixation to recover from a drying-rewetting cycle. In addition, we assessed how N-2 fixation changes with incubation time with acetylene (2-65 h). A drying period of 3 days almost completely eliminated N-2 fixation (< 0.2 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) in the moss. However, rates slowly recovered after rewetting, reaching N-2 fixation levels of moist (non-water stressed) moss 5 days after rewetting. Nitrogen fixation increased significantly with incubation time with acetylene (0 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) at 2 h vs. 26 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) at 65 h incubation). Although N-2 fixation recommenced upon rewetting, the recovery was slow.

Given such difficulties, there are a few interdisciplinary methodologies, capable of carrying out multi -objective analyses for this kind of buildings, and they are often based on in situ monitoring that, however, may not be able to predict the effects deriving from different conceivable technologies and control strategies. In this work, an interdisciplinary methodology is employed for evaluating cultural heritage conservation conditions, occupants 'thermal comfort and energy performance of a specific historic building category, such as churches, on the basis of experimental and numerical approach. The methodology was applied to the case study of an ancient Italian church, recently restored following the earthquake that hit L'Aquila in 2009. After the refurbishment of the church, the statistical analysis of temperature and relative humidity experimental data allowed to observe that the conservation conditions of artistic heritage just restored may be non-correct, due to remarkable thermohygrometric fluctuations of the indoor microclimate. Therefore, starting from the current condition of absence of HVAC system, calibrated dynamic simulation models of the church allowed to hypothesize different technological solutions able to control the indoor microclimate and to evaluate the effects on artworks preservation, thermal comfort, and energy performance. The results of the multi -scenario analysis showed that suitable conservation conditions (PIs > 90%) and thermal comfort can be obtained by employing a complex heating/cooling and humidification/dehumidification system which determines a significant increase in energy consumption.

The study of mast production was conducted at six experimental woodland sites situated across an elevational gradient of 1500-2000 m in proximity to permanent meteorological stations. The dominant woody species were Juniper monosperma, Pinus edulis, and Quercus turbinella. Functioning of arid ecosystems of the Southwest undergoes seasonal, annual and multidecadal fluctuations which link to corresponding dynamics of available moisture. Results of the 1997-2004 study show a gradual decrease in mast production of all three species at all six sites, due to a continuing drought in this period. Mast production in a given year is determined to a considerable extent by available moisture during the entire growth year, from the previous spring to the current summer. The areas of oak-pinyon-juniper woodlands with higher elevation and highest precipitation generally have the highest yield of juniper berries, pinyon nuts and acorns. The severe drought of 2001-2003 has been accompanied by a mass dying of mature pinyon pines and loss of foliage in junipers. According to our observations, there is no correlation between mast production and amount of precipitation in the current year's monsoon period (June-September). A high correlation between acorn production and non-monsoonal precipitation (October-May) was established, but no such correlation was found for juniper berries and pinyon nuts. Weather conditions (wind, temperature, and moisture) of late May are a critical factor determining the success of fertilization and subsequent mast production in all three species.

In the present paper, radiometric calibration accuracy of FungYun-3A (FY-3A) Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) thermal infrared (TIR) channel was evaluated based on simultaneous nadir observation (SNO) intercalibration method. Hyperspectral and high-quality measurements of METOP-A/IASI were used as reference. Assessment uncertainty from intercalibration method was also investigated by examining the relation between BT bias against four main collocation factors, i. e. observation time difference, view geometric difference related to zenith angles and azimuth angles, and scene spatial homogeneity. It was indicated that the BT bias is evenly distributed across the collocation variables with no significant linear relationship in MERSI IR channel. Among the four collocation factors, the scene spatial homogeneity may be the most important factor with the uncertainty less than 2% of BT bias. Statistical analysis of monitoring biases during one and a half years indicates that the brightness temperature measured by MERSI is much warmer than that of IASI. The annual mean bias (MERSI-IASI) in 2012 is (3. 18 +/- 0. 34) K. Monthly averaged BT biases show a little seasonal variation character, and fluctuation range is less than 0. 8K. To further verify the reliability, our evaluation result was also compared with the synchronous experiment results at Dunhuang and Qinghai Lake sites, which showed excellent agreement. Preliminary analysis indicates that there are two reasons leading to the warm bias. One is the overestimation of blackbody emissivity, and the other is probably the incorrect spectral respond function which has shifted to window spectral.

Major taxa studied Effects of N on plant productivity. Methods We synthesized 63 N addition studies with duration >= 8 years in natural terrestrial ecosystems. Results Our results showed temporally dynamic impacts of N on plant productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. The interannual coefficient of variation (CV) of N impacts ranged from 19 to 768% across 63 studies, with higher variability in acidic soils. Moreover, a substantial proportion (44%) of studies showed evidence of a consistent directional change in the strength of the impacts of N over time. The direction of change varied with biome type (forests, decrease; grasslands and shrublands, increase). The temporal pattern of the impacts of N was mostly responsive to mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT) and initial soil pH, which accounted for 24%, 19% and 19% of the variation, respectively. Main conclusions Our findings indicate that temporally dynamic impacts of long-term N addition on plant productivity and large fluctuations of the impacts of N between years are generally observed among studies in terrestrial ecosystems.

This may be due to an insufficient representation of the cryosphere in such models because the deep ocean thermohaline properties are strongly determined by high-latitude surface conditions. In this study, it is our aim to arrive at an improved simulation of polar water mass characteristics and distribution in the framework of an ocean climate model. As a step toward identifying the critical factors influencing the high-latitude water masses, in particular those of the Southern Ocean, we have proceeded a series of sensitivity experiments with a global sea ice-ocean model. Forcing Southern Ocean sea ice with daily instead of monthly fluctuating wind enhances brine release due to new-ice formation, which leads to a more pronounced core of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW) in the Antarctic oceanic regime. Wider Antarctic shelf topography improves the distribution and thickness of sea ice, simultaneously providing a brine reservoir on the shelf, which is a crucial ingredient in the formation process of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW). As a consequence, the salinity on the Antarctic shelf is increased with depth as observed. Intense southeasterly katabatic winds play a significant role in increasing the salinity, mainly off east Antarctica. It is suggested that modeled Southern Ocean water mass properties are highly sensitive to the large scale and regional forcing of Antarctic sea ice as well as the model representation of the shelf topography, the width of which is crucial to reproducing the first-order features of near-boundary convection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 15,1998,103,C11,,,,,24891,24906,,10.1029/98JC02413,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/98JC02413,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000076374900020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current diversity-stability studies, which have largely focused on species diversity, often report an increase in the stability of aggregate community properties with increasing species diversity. Few studies have examined the linkage between phylogenetic diversity, another important dimension of biodiversity, and stability. By taking species evolutionary history into account, phylogenetic diversity may better capture the diversity of traits and niches of species in a community than species diversity and better relate to temporal stability. In this study, we investigated whether phylogenetic diversity could affect temporal stability of community biomass independent of species diversity. Methods We performed an experiment in laboratory microcosms with a pool of 12 bacterivorous ciliated protist species. To eliminate the possibility of species diversity effects confounding with phylogenetic diversity effects, we assembled communities that had the same number of species but varied in the level of phylogenetic diversity. Weekly disturbance, in the form of short-term temperature shock, was imposed on each microcosm and species abundances were monitored over time. We examined the relationship between temporal stability of community biomass and phylogenetic diversity and evaluated the role of several stabilizing mechanisms for explaining the influence of phylogenetic diversity on temporal stability. Important Findings Our results showed that increasing phylogenetic diversity promoted temporal stability of community biomass. Both total community biomass and summed variances showed a U-shaped relationship with phylogenetic diversity, driven by the presence of large, competitively superior species that attained large biomass and high temporal variation in their biomass in both low and high phylogenetic diversity communities.

Our laboratory incubation of 209 eggs (17 clutches) from wild-caught Swedish grass snakes (Natrix natrix) showed that scale abnormalities (half-scales on one side of the body, often reflecting lateral asymmetry in the number of ribs) occurred more frequently if eggs were incubated under cooler conditions. Especially at low incubation temperatures, individuals with scale asymmetries took longer to hatch than did symmetric conspecifics, were smaller in body length at hatching and were slower in trials of locomotor speed. Anti-predator tactics also covaried with scale asymmetry. These patterns suggest that individuals with asymmetric scales should have lower fitness and hence should rarely survive to adulthood in the wild. We tested this prediction by examining 201 field-collected snakes from museum collections. As predicted, scale asymmetries were seen primarily in small snakes, and rarely in larger animals. We interpret these data to suggest that scale asymmetries in this species offer an index of developmental instability and that fitness disadvantages to disrupted embryogenesis impose selection against suboptimal nest-site choice by females.",,,,,,"Hagman, Mattias/0000-0002-1973-5221",,,,,,,,,,,,,1010-061X,,,,,JAN,2011,24,1,,,,,177,183,,10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02153.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02153.x,,,,,,,,20964787,,,,,WOS:000285418500017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Small bumps at the outer edges of the disks provide a variable amount of interparticle coupling in the form of geometric friction. The disks each spin counter-clockwise, but undergo a transition in their collective circulation around the center of the arena, from a clockwise orbit to a counter-clockwise orbit, as a function of packing fraction phi. We identify that, unlike for vibrated granular gases, the particles' velocity distributions are Gaussian over a large range of phi. By fitting the speed distribution to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, we identify a temperature-like parameter which is a universal function of phi; this parameter is also equal to the mean translational energy of the particles. We quantify the collective circulation via its solid-body-like rotation rate, and find that this is a universal function centered around a critical packing fraction. In addition, the ratio of orbital kinetic energy to spin kinetic energy is also a universal function for non-zero geometric friction.

Spatial and temporal patterns of variability in rates of larval settlement may provide clues as to the processes that drive their transport and onshore delivery, as well as variation in the supply side of population dynamics. Over 3 consecutive seasons (2006-2008), the settlement of three intertidal barnacles (the chthamaloids Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus, and the balanoid Notobalanus flosculus) was monitored daily at 5 to 6 sites spread over ca. 10 km around the bay of Cartagena in central Chile, and over periods of 48,71 and 53 consecutive days that encompassed the settlement season of these species. This sampling effort yielded settlement data with an unprecedented combination of temporal resolution and spatial coverage, which allowed us to assess and compare: (1) spatial patterns of settlement and their persistence over scales of days within each season, (2) inter-annual variation in pattern persistence, and (3) the relationship between such variation and inter-annual changes in spatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) variability over synoptic and high-frequency scales. While on average the spatial pattern of settlement in chthamaloids became less persistent from 2006 to 2008, the settlement pattern of N. flosculus across sites remained persistent regardless of inter-annual changes in mean settlement rates. Within seasons, the spatial patterns of settlement of N. flosculus were persistent over scales of at least 15 days, whereas for chthamaloids a spatially ordered pattern of settlement in 2006 disappeared in subsequent years. Together, these results suggest that spatially structured processes that drive larval transport, and which can vary from year to year, may have played a greater role in shaping settlement patterns of chthamaloids versus balanoids. Synoptic-scale SST variability (i.e. days) exhibited spatial structure that was highly persistent within all three seasons. Although high-frequency SST variability (i.e. hours) has been associated to onshore larval transport within the study region, its among-site patterns were not as persistent as the daily ones. Since neither synoptic-scale nor high-frequency processes shaping patterns of physical variability are sufficient to explain inter-annual variability in patterns of larval settlement, more complex physical-biological interactions must be examined. We suggest that inter-annual changes in the pattern of wind forcing relative to local topography, and the thermal structure that results from such interaction, might be related to whether the spatial structure of barnacle settlement is persistent or fluctuating within a given season. We discuss the limitations of inferences that can be made regarding transport processes from time series of larval settlement, and the insights that can be gained by focusing on the variability of spatial patterns rather than temporal changes at individual sites.

However, the impact of solar panel's shading on apple performance needs to be investigated before being commercially adopted. A dynamic agrivoltaic system was installed in the south of France over a 10-year-old 'Golden Delicious' apple orchard and studied during three experimental seasons (2019-2021). This study aimed to evaluate the impact of fluctuating shading (photovoltaic panel orientation to maximise panel light interception) on water relations, leaf morphophysiological characteristics and yield determinants. With the selected photovoltaic design and strategy, trees were grown under a fluctuating shading (variable shading between 4% and 88% during the day) with a mean shading rate of 50-55%. On average, the air temperature was reduced by 3.8 degrees C, while relative humidity was increased by 14% under shading conditions. Depending on the season, the lower radiation and stressful microclimate decreased the irrigation between 6% and 31%. Fluctuating shading reduced the photosynthetic capacity of leaves and increased their specific leaf area (thinner leaves). The reduction in carbohydrate assimilation under shading was associated with lower starch reserve accumulation in the shoots (-7%), lower flower intensity at the shoot scale (-31%) and a lower proportion of trees with a high floribundity in 2020 (-45%). However, less alternate bearing was observed under shading, and better frost protection resulted in a higher proportion of trees bearing fruit under photovoltaic panels (+31%) and number of fruits per fruit-bearing tree (+44%) in 2021. Fruit size was less sensitive than fruit number to shading. Fruit size was reduced by 17% in 2019 but maintained in 2020 and 2021, probably due to a better water status of shaded trees that accumulated more water. Fruit dry matter content under shading was reduced by an average of 24%. In conclusion, agrivoltaic systems may reduce alternate bearing behaviour in apple trees, showing the importance of carrying out a multi-year study. However, the fluctuating shading strategy tested in this study did not maintain sufficient yields, with yields below 40 t/ha in all three years of study. Identifying the positive and negative effects of shading in this study may be useful for the development of sustainable apple orchard shading strategies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-4238,1879-1018,,,,DEC 15,2022,306,,,,,,,,111434,10.1016/j.scienta.2022.111434,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2022.111434,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000857304700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

These environments are subject to large fluctuations in quantity and quality of suspended particulate matter (seston), due mainly to the resuspension of benthic sediments by the action of winds and tides. In spite of variations in the availability of suspended food, these species demonstrate rapid growth rates during most of the year. Laboratory tests feeding were carried out with different artificially prepared diets in order to understand the physiological compensations effected by these bivalves in response to fluctuations of suspended particulate matter. A total of 48 different combinations of microalgae (Isochrysis galbana) and natural sediment collected from the intertidal zone were tested, having concentrations ranging from 1.9 to 203 mg l(-1), and containing 18-91% organic matter. Absorption, oxygen consumption and excretion were measured in both species for each experimental diet in order to calculate the physiological index scope for growth. Temperature was maintained constant at 14 degreesC and salinity at 30parts per thousand. Both species demonstrated a high degree of physiological plasticity, which allowed them to maintain a positive scope for growth under most dietary conditions. The epifaunal species M. chilensis was better adapted to an environment having intermediate quantities of seston (50-150 mg l(-1) and 40-60% organic matter); its scope for growth was high due to its high rate of energy absorption. The infaunal M. edulis was not well adapted with very low concentrations and quality of food (<3 mg l(-1) and <25% organic material), and had a negative scope for growth under these conditions due to a low absorption rate and high energy losses through oxygen consumption and excretion. However, this species was well adapted to high concentrations and/or high quality of seston (>100 mg l(-1) and 60% organic matter) where it showed a higher scope for growth due to an increase in absorption rate. M chilensis showed better scope for growth in comparison with M edulis, explainable by its greater feeding capacity, suggesting that the epifaunal species has an adaptive advantage through being able to better compete for available food, especially when there are low concentrations of seston in the water.

In the laboratory, feeding fish (approximately 50 g) with feed containing viable B. pumilus at concentrations of 1 x 10(7)-10(9) colony forming units (CFU)/kg elevated fish immune responses, as indicated by their phagooytic activity and superoxide anion levels, and led to more effective disease resistance against Streptococcus agalactiae. However, when these concentrations were applied to Nile tilapia cultures growing in cage culture systems, only B. pumilus AQAHBS01 at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/kg diet could effectively enhance disease resistance against S. agalactiae during the critical period of early to middle April when the temperature reached 33 degrees C, whereas control fish and fish that consumed B. pumilus AQAHBS01 at concentrations of 1 x 10(7) CFU/kg showed very rapid streptococcosis-induced mortality. However, in late April, massive levels of organic matter-containing water flowed into the culture areas, causing all fish groups to become infected with Flavobacterium columnare. Moreover, the dissolved oxygen levels in the river declined to critical levels of approximately 1.0-1.5 mg/L, causing anorectic effects in fish for long periods of time. This effect may have also gradually killed the cultured fish until the end of the experiment. This information strongly demonstrates the effective application of B. pumilus as a probiotic for streptococcosis resistance in both laboratory and field culture conditions. For on-farm cage culture practices, however, fluctuations in water quality remain a significant constraint for probiotic application, as they usually induce negative effects on fish health. This decline in health makes fish more fragile and more susceptible to problems from both infectious and non-infectious diseases, which farmers must consider carefully. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

At each depth, an experimental platform was exposed for a summer period, a winter period, and about an entire year. On the up- and down-facing side of each platform, substrates were fixed to document the succession of bioerosion traces, and to measure variations in bioerosion and accretion rates. In total, 29 different bioerosion traces were recorded revealing a dominance of microborings produced by phototrophic and organotrophic microendoliths, complemented by few macroborings, attachment scars, and grazing traces. The highest bioerosion activity was recorded in 15 m up-facing substrates in the shallow euphotic zone, largely driven by phototrophic cyanobacteria. Towards the chlorophyte-dominated deep euphotic to dysphotic zones and the organotroph-dominated aphotic zone the intensity of bioerosion and the diversity of bioerosion traces strongly decreased. During summer the activity of phototrophs was higher than during winter, which was likely stimulated by enhanced light availability due to more hours of daylight and increased irradiance angles. Stable water column stratification and a resulting nutrient depletion in shallow water led to lower turbidity levels and caused a shift in the photic zonation that was reflected by more phototrophs being active at greater depth. With respect to the subordinate bioerosion activity of organotrophs, fluctuations in temperature and the trophic regime were assumed to be the main seasonal controls. The observed patterns in overall bioeroder distribution and abundance were mirrored by the calculated carbonate budget with bioerosion rates exceeding carbonate accretion rates in shallow water and distinctly higher bioerosion rates at all depths during summer.

However, it is largely unknown how much underlying microscopic variability is compatible with normal development. Here, we quantify embryo-to-embryo variability in vertebrate development by studying cell number variation in the zebrafish endoderm. We notice that the size of a sub-population of the endoderm, the dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs, which later form the left-right organizer), exhibits significantly more embryo-to-embryo variation than the rest of the endoderm. We find that, with incubation of the embryos at elevated temperature, the frequency of left-right laterality defects is increased drastically in embryos with a low number of DFCs. Furthermore, we observe that these fluctuations have a large stochastic component among fish of the same genetic background. Hence, a stochastic variation in early development leads to a remarkably strong macroscopic phenotype.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, thrip species have caused economic damage to the olive yield in the region of Biskra throughout the history of this crop, although the thrips pest species was unknown. To solve this question, we studied the thrips composition of one olive orchard over three years and the seasonal abundance of the species responsible of the damage of the olives in relation to the phenologic development of the olive tree This study was conducted to determine Thysanoptera species composition associated with olive trees, fruit injury, fluctuations in the abundance of the most phytophagous species relative to the phenological stages of the olive tree, and the temporal variations in the species Neohydatothrips amygdali in relation to environmental variations in Biskra province between 2018 and 2020. The olive orchard chosen for this study is located at the Experimental Station of the Technical Institute for the Development of Saharan Agriculture (ITDAS) in El Outaya (Biskra, a Saharan region of Algeria). Five trees were sampled each week, and thrips were collected by shaking 20 twigs (4 twigs per tree). Identification of thrips species was based on morphological characters of adults. Microscopic observation of the collected thrips specimens made it possible to report nine thrips species. Among them, four are reported for the first time in Algeria. Three taxa, namely Haplothrips tritici, Neohydatothrips amygdali, and Frankliniella occidentalis constituted the eudominant groups, representing 28.65%, 27.98%, and 23.39% of total specimens collected during the study, respectively. Thrips injury appeared as scaring and silvering of the fruit. The most abundant species was H. tritici, but N. amygdali was most common in the last two years of the survey. The influence of phenological stages of olive trees on the total number of H. tritici and F. occidentalis was significant. The highest numbers were recorded in flowering stage. The highest number of N. amygdali had two peaks: April (2020) and May (2018, 2019), as well as September (2020) and October (2018, 2019), when temperatures fluctuated between 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. N. amygdali was totally absent during the other months (in winter and summer).

The basal diet contained 43% crude protein from fish meal, soybean meal, yeast, wheat meal and crystalline amino acids with 0.65% methionine and 0.29% cystine on a dry diet basis. Six diets were formulated with six graded levels of methionine (0.66% to 1.89% in about 0.25% increment). Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 180 juvenile fish in seawater floating net cages (1.0 x 1.0 x 1.5 m). Fish were fed twice daily (05:00 and 17:30) to apparent satiation for 10 weeks. The water temperature fluctuated from 27 to 30 degrees C, salinity from 25 parts per thousand to 28 parts per thousand and dissolved oxygen was approximately 7 mg l(-1) during the experimental period. Specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) increased with increasing levels of methionine up to 1.41% diet (P < 0.05), and thereafter, declined. No significant differences in body composition were found among dietary treatments. On the basis of either SGR or FCE, the optimum dietary methionine requirements of juvenile large yellow croaker were estimated to be 1.44% of diet (3.34% of dietary protein) and 1.39% of diet (3.22% of dietary protein), respectively, using second-order polynomial regression analysis. Hence, the corresponding requirements of this fish for total sulfur amino acids (Met+Cys) were calculated to be 1.73% of diet (4.02% of dietary protein) and 1.68% of diet (3.91% of dietary protein), respectively.

When the quality of food available was increased, by adding a mixture of litter from herbaceous dicotyledonous plants to a background low-quality food of dead grasses, survivorship was found to be the most phenotypically plastic trait, increasing by 168%. Growth rates increased by 99% but reproductive allocation by only 21%. In the field, members of a population from a site with more high-quality food grew more than twice as fast as those from a site where less high-quality food was available. The population from the site with higher food availability, contrary to predictions from the laboratory study, did not survive as well as that from the site with less available high-quality food. This may be because the site that is more favourable for growth has a more stressful physical environment due to much bigger temperature fluctuations, which are known to be an important cause of mortality in this species. When individuals from both populations were reared under controlled laboratory conditions, both the parental and F1 generations from the poor growth environment survived better than those from the good growth habitat. However, even when given an excess of high-quality food those from the poor growth environment continued to grow more slowly and had a lower reproductive allocation than those from the site with higher food availability. We conclude that microevolutionary changes may have occurred in the balance of resource allocation between survivorship, growth and reproductive allocation, to favour higher survivorship during the longer prereproductive period at the site where growth to the threshold size for reproduction takes longer.",,,,,"Benton, Tim G/C-6493-2009","Benton, Tim G/0000-0002-7448-1973",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,SEP,2003,137,1,,,,,85,89,,10.1007/s00442-003-1325-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-003-1325-1,,,,,,,,12827489,,,,,WOS:000185674200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Innovative methods need to be developed in semiarid areas to analyze the special hydrological factors in the water resource systems of these areas. Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) were applied with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data in this paper to analyze spatiotemporal changes of hydrological factors in the Xiliaohe River Basin (XRB). The results showed that precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET) and temperature (T) had similar seasonal change patterns at rates of 0.05 cm/yr., 0.01 cm/yr. and -0.05 degrees C/yr., respectively. Total water storage change (TWSC) was consistent with the change trend of soil moisture change (SMC) and showed a fluctuating trend.

Furthermore, a lag period of 0 to 1 months was observed for the effects of P and ET on TWSC and GLDAS. NDVI showed an upward trend at a rate of 0.001 yr(-1) between 2002 and 2014. A spatial distribution of NDVI was heterogeneous in the study area. ET, GLDAS and GWC in growing season limited vegetation growth and were more important than other factors in XRB.

Fires in peatlands are dominated by smouldering combustion which is the self-sustained, slow, low temperature, flameless form of burning. Most studies on peat fires to date have focused on ignition conditions, C losses or atmospheric emissions, but there is a significant gap in the understanding of the evolution of organic matter (OM) following smouldering. A key feature of smouldering fires is that they consume most of the pyrogenic char produced. Consequently, it may be that most smouldering fires are simply not visible using standard palaeontological techniques. Here we present the possibility of identifying palaeofires by following their physical and chemical signature along a peat profile. We have undertaken laboratory experiments on Sphagnum peat columns and measured physical, chemical and spectroscopic changes of OM features induced by smouldering on samples of varying moisture content. We reveal that there is a higher production of aromatic and condensed molecules, an increase of the total N and a decrease of the C/N ratio, besides significant variations of pH, electrical conductivity and ash content. Several of these changes have, in previous studies, been taken to be indicative of alterations in atmospheric dust deposition and climate-driven changes (e.g., vegetation, water table fluctuation, decomposition and mineralization processes), but are also produced by smouldering fires. Our results imply that smouldering fires should therefore also be considered in climatic and floral reconstructions drawn from peat cores and that these additional physical and chemical changes may serve to enhance our understanding of palaeofire histories.

Few studies have examined the effects of a range of explanatory factors operating simultaneously on the same population over a long period. Based on 41 years of monitoring (1979-2019), we tested prevailing hypotheses about drivers of annual variation in breeding success in two sympatric species of boreal forest grouse-the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) and the black grouse (T. tetrix)-in a 45 km(2) boreal forest landscape. From counts in early August, we measured breeding success (chicks/hen) along with potential determining factors. We formulated five main hypotheses on causes of variation (hen condition, chick weather, chick food, predation, demographic characteristics) and derived 13 associated explanatory variables for analysis. We first tested the five hypotheses separately and then used model selection (AICc) to rank the best predictive models irrespective of hypotheses. Lastly, we used path analysis to illuminate potential causal relationships. Barring demographic characteristics, all hypotheses were supported, most strongly for chick food and predation. Among predictor variables, chick food (insect larvae and bilberry fruit crops), vole and fox abundances, the winter-NAO index, and temperature after hatching, had the strongest effect sizes in both species. Precipitation after hatching had no detectable effect. Model selection indicated bottom-up factors to be more important than predation, but confounding complicated interpretation. Path analysis suggested that the high explanatory power of bilberry fruiting was due not only to its direct positive effect on chick food quality but also to an indirect positive effect on vole abundance, which buffers predation. The two components of breeding success-proportion of hens with broods and number of chicks per brood-were uncorrelated, the former having the strongest effect. The two components had different ecological correlates that often varied asynchronously, resulting in overall breeding success fluctuating around low to moderate levels. Our study highlights the complexity of key explanatory drivers and the importance of considering multiple hypotheses of breeding success. Although chick food appeared to equal or surpass predation in explaining the annual variation in breeding success, predation may still be the overall limiting factor. Comparative and experimental studies of confounded variables (bilberry fruiting, voles, and larvae) are needed to disentangle causes of variation in breeding success of boreal forest grouse.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,OCT,2022,12,10,,,,,,,e9327,10.1002/ece3.9327,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9327,,,,,,,,36248675,,,,,WOS:000865321900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These pipefish were periodically collected from the shallow seagrass beds in Otsuchi Bay on the Pacific coast of northern Honshu, Japan, from spring to autumn to investigate the basic reproductive ecology. Appearance of the pipefish in the coastal seagrass beds coincided with the initiation of reproduction. The reproductive season was from May to at least October, with its peak in July. A rearing experiment revealed that the brooding period of the male had a negative correlation with water temperature, and it was estimated to last about 1 month in the bay. Almost all males were brooding during the peak of the reproductive season. Although. the brood pouch of most males was either full or devoid of eggs, 6.2% of the males had a partially filled (20%-90%) brood pouch, and multiple clutches were identified in the brood pouch of some males, indicating that the mating system of the pipefish is polygamous, perhaps polygynous. Sex ratio fluctuated among months. and the overall sex ratio tended to be biased to male. Body size of males with an immature brood pouch had a wide range, from 133 to 215 mm standard length (SL). The smallest brooding male was 134 mm SL. Mean SL of brooding males was significantly larger than that of nonbrooding mature males. The number of males with an immature brood pouch was greater at the beginning than later in the reproductive season. The results seem to collectively indicate that the occurrence of a larger proportion of immature males at the onset of the reproductive season may be ascribed to both new recruitment and larger body size at maturation, resulting from the males trading the reproductive effort to somatic growth, perhaps to increase future reproductive success.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1341-8998,,,,,MAY 25,2001,48,2,,,,,155,160,,10.1007/s10228-001-8130-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-001-8130-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000169222800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Changes of pH, EC, and uptake concentrations of macro elements were measured at twelve intervals varying from 11 to 51 days, depending on the season and plant sizes. Plant growth and cut flower yield were also recorded. The higher concentration of nutrient solution increased flower production and the cut flower length. The pH at both concentrations sharply increased up to 8.5 in the winter, but that of the higher concentration remained constant during periods of high temperature. The uptake of elements fluctuated seasonally and cyclically, descending in the summer and rising in the winter. The average uptake of the macro elements was NO3- 7.2, H2PO4- 3.3,K+ 2.7, Ca2+ 4.2, Mg2+ 1.2, and SO(4)(2-)1.0(me.liter(-1)). The lower uptake concentrations made in the summer months were from 44% (NO3-) to 56% (K+) of those absorbed in the winter months. The range of seasonal fluctuations in uptake concentrations depended on the elements, of which NO3- produced the most notable change; thus the pH of solution at the end of the sampling date-varied. The result illustrates that not only ion balance but also seasonal changes in uptake concentration, which may appertain to transpiration velocity, are important factors to know in order to keep the nutrient solution in the root environment constant. NH4+ and H2PO4- which tend to be absorbed preferentially beyond the level of nutrient concentrations, require further experiments to determine how to maintain the optimum concentration levels in the nutrient solution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1882-3351,1880-358X,,,,JAN,1998,67,1,,,,,116,122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000071497100019,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in shallow aquatic ecosystems, it is unclear whether the oxygen regime is driven by oxygen production and consumption in the water column or by sediment oxygen demand (SOD). In managed eutrophic ecosystems, this question is especially important in the context of extreme daily oscillations of dissolved oxygen (DO) that could breach physiological limits of heterotrophic aerobic organisms. High-frequency measurement of DO, temperature, global radiation (Gl.Rad.), and pH in a 0.6 m deep, 22 ha eutrophic fishpond Rod (Czech Republic) shows that the oxygen regime depended on the ecosystem state. Over the clearwater period in the early season, the DO level reflected ecosystem heterotrophy with relatively low daily DO oscillations. However, during the summer phytoplankton bloom, the fishpond was primarily autotrophic with extreme DO fluctuation. During late summer, a collapse of the phytoplankton bloom and an associated shift towards heterotrophy and DO deficit frequently occur. In-situ mesocosm experiments in Rod fishpond were conducted throughout 2018 and 2019 growing seasons, to address the importance of SOD to the oxygen regime. We enclosed the water column in transparent and opaque/dark plastic cylinders open or closed to the sediment. The results show that the proportional contribution of SOD to total respiration decreased from 70 to 90% at low phytoplankton biomass (expressed as Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration) to approximately 10% at phytoplankton bloom. At night, the difference between the oxygen consumption in the cylinders with or without sediment was statistically significant, when the concentration of Chl-a was <100 mu g.L-1 On the contrary, the difference was not significant when the concentration of Chl-a was >100 mu g.L-1 This revealed that the impact of SOD is negligible at high phytoplankton biomass.

Because snow cover effectively buffers soil against changes in air temperature, fluctuations in snowpack could alter freeze-thaw cycling, resulting in shifts in macroaggregate stability and subsequent detachment. Moreover, vegetation type could modify these effects; however, these interactions remain unexplored. In this study, we experimentally manipulated snow cover in an agricultural field and in an adjacent 13-year-old restored prairie to assess changes to soil aggregation and detachment over a three-winter period (November-April 2014-17). Treatments consisted of complete snow removal, natural snow cover, and a sustained snowpack simulated via straw insulation. Averaged over the course of the study, snow removal resulted in a 5% and 15% over-winter reduction in wet-aggregate stability (WAS) and mean weight diameter (MWD), respectively. Conversely, natural snow cover and straw insulation resulted in a 3% and 15% over-winter increase in WAS and MWD, respectively. However, over-winter changes to WAS and MWD did not persist but instead appeared to return to a set point by the end of each growing season regardless of vegetation type. In addition, we found an offset in WAS; it was approximately 11% higher in the prairie than in the agricultural field, likely due to increased root and microbial activity in the prairie. No similar offset was observed in MWD between vegetation types. These responses in soil aggregation did not result in significant springtime changes to soil critical shear stress, measured as a proxy for soil detachment potential. The results of this study suggest that future investigations into over-winter soil processes should consider vegetation type, temporal soil aggregation dynamics, and more detailed quantification of freeze-thaw cycling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-7061,1872-6259,,,,JAN 1,2020,357,,,,,,,,113954,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.113954,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.113954,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000496837300020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, a realistic, interannual, high-resolution model of the Persian Gulf is presented, validated against observations and then used to describe the intraseasonal to interannual variability in the circulation, water mass formation and exchange through the Strait of Hormuz. Sensitivity experiments to model settings, in particular vertical mixing parameterizations, have been performed in order to have the best comparison with all available observations. Main circulation and water mass characteristics correspond well to observations and previous modeling studies on the seasonal timescale. A barotropic cyclonic gyre dominates the general circulation in the Gulf from April to July then breaks down into smaller features as wind intensifies and stratification decreases due to winter cooling. Dense salty water is formed in the northwest part of the Gulf and in the southern banks, but the latter reaches the Strait of Hormuz from November to April only. While temperature fluctuations are mostly seasonal, salinity has substantial fluctuations on the interannual timescale that cannot be directly related to atmospheric fluxes because of the importance of the exchanges at Hormuz for the salt budget within the Gulf. This advocates the use of atmospheric conditions including interannual variations when running models of the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, the interannual variations in the net transport at Hormuz directly follow variations in the evaporation minus precipitation over the Gulf.

J.",,,INFLUENCES OF ENVIRONMENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND LIFETIME REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE IN DOMESTIC RABBIT FEMALES,WORLD RABBIT SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Environmental insults of different nature and intensity, such as fluctuation in the air temperature, which can affect access to food, its quality and diseases, are a reality in any livestock system. This is much more important when the insults occur in early life, conditioning the development and adult life of animals. In ecology, for instance, it is widely accepted that high quality offspring are more reactive against predators, occupy better territories and find more mates, resulting in longer lives and greater fitness. It is also a given that adults exposed to famine or disease as juveniles have shorter lives and produce fewer offspring. To determine whether the environment influences the development and lifetime reproductive performance of rabbit females, we designed an experiment combining two factors: nest and pubescent development. Nest development was measured by recording the average daily gain of 864 females during suckling and during their pubescent life (63 to 184 d old), and body development was conditioned by providing animals a high-energy control (C) or a fibre-rich (F) diet. However, in the course of the study, 191 of the 864 pubescent females were exposed to rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). This unexpected environmental insult was considered as a third experimental factor influencing the reproductive performance of rabbit females. Contrary to expectation, fast suckling gain impairs reproductive lifespan, resulting in fewer newborn kits produced in a female lifetime. Although females on diet F lived 37 d longer than females on diet C, this difference was only perceived in their pubescent life. In addition, the exposure to RHD interacted with suckling gain (SG). Exposed females with a fast SG produced more kits as adults, but in the absence of the virus, high SG females produced fewer newborn kits. These results open new insights into the management of future breeders during nesting and pubescent life.",,,,,"Martínez-Paredes, Eugenio/C-8906-2015; Pascual, Juan Jose/ABD-9115-2020; Savietto, Davi/J-6870-2013","Martínez-Paredes, Eugenio/0000-0002-0631-1032; Pascual, Juan Jose/0000-0002-7224-9978; Savietto, Davi/0000-0002-1833-5832",,,,,,,,,,,,,1257-5011,1989-8886,,,,JUL-SEP,2019,27,3,,,,,123,133,,10.4995/wrs.2019.11968,http://dx.doi.org/10.4995/wrs.2019.11968,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000488282100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Monthly samples of different types of irrigation water (treated wastewater, groundwater, and fresh canal water) were collected. Both physicochemical characteristics and heavy metal concentration were evaluated. Different citrus plant samples and fruits from three different species of citrus trees were collected from the sewage farm as well as the farms irrigated with groundwater and canal water. All citrus tree samples were partitioned into: leaves, stem and citrus fruit. The fruits were divided to the outer crust, and squeezed juice. The results showed that the level of metals in treated wastewater was within the permissible limits; while the citrus trees irrigated by this water contains higher levels due to metals accumulation. One important notice is that the toxic metals including Cd, Pb, Ni, Cr in all cases were at the lowest and/or below detection limit, particularly, in the citrus juice. The outer crust of the citrus fruits contained the second lowest level of all metal. Thus, the citrus fruits showed no accumulation of heavy metals. This could be explained by the fact that heavy metals were up taken by the roots and only smaller fractions were trans-located to the other parts of the tree. The essential nutrient metals including Fe, Mn, and Zn were accumulated mostly by leaves and stems. It was concluded that heavy metal accumulated differently according to the plant species, the part of the tree and fruit. Such fluctuations are governed by the irrigating water, pH of the soil, plant uptake and/or water-soil-to-plant transfer factors. Other factors include temperature, moisture, organic matter, phosphorous content and the availability of the other nutrient elements.

Here we investigated the following: (a) do changes in plant diversity affect leaf-out and flowering dates for woody species; (b) which group of variables are more important in influencing leaf-out and flowering dates, abiotic variables (soil variables) or biotic variables (plant diversity)? Study site A subtropical forest in the Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning Experiment of China, located in Jiangxi Province, China. Methods Species were planted in various combinations to create plots with varying tree richness: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 24 species. We monitored leaf-out and flowering dates of eight randomly selected species in 17 plots in 2018. A linear model was used to test whether species diversity was a predictor of leaf-out/flowering times for each species. We then fit linear mixed-effects models to assess the combined influence of species diversity, soil Total Carbon and Total Nitrogen on the overall community. Results In the low-diversity plots, we found two species leafing out earlier, one leafing out later and four showing no significant difference. Leaf-out date advanced an average of 0.3 days per species lost. Of all the biotic and abiotic predictor variables, Total Nitrogen was the only one significantly correlated with leaf-out date. No significant correlation was found between species diversity and flowering date for any of the species. Conclusions Our study provides the first empirical evidence concerning the effects of biodiversity loss on plant spring phenology for woody species. Our findings illustrate that fluctuation in plant diversity could alter the timing of leaf-out and that abiotic variables may be more important than biotic variables in determining leaf-out dates in subtropical forest.

This process leads to changes in main sperm parameters such as motility and speed. Various factors such as the type of storage media, the addition of some biological substances in the diet and the freezing regimes are influenced by the cryopreservation of the sperm. The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of cryopreservation on the speed parameters of sperm from breeds of Lacaune and Ile de France sheep. The experiment was carried out with 10 sexually mature, pure bred rams during their breeding campaign. The animals were divided in two groups according to the breed - 5 rams of each breed (Ile de France and Lacaune). The assessment of sperm motility, concentration and various kinematic parameters of motile spermatozoa were carried out by Sperm Class Analyzer (SCA, Microptic, Spain). Cryopreservation of semen straws was done by the method of CASSOU [(13)]. The results show that in the Lacaune breed, the amount of static spermatozoa after thawing increases significantly while the Ile de France breeds even slightly decreases. With respect to progressive and non-progressive mobile sperm, both breeds showed a decrease after thawing, but in the case of Ile de France it was much less. All speed indicators (VCL, VSL and VAP) and parameters - percentage of linearity (LIN, %), percentage of straightness (STR, %) and percentage of fluctuations (WOB, %) for Ile de France breed increase, albeit a little after thawing, while the other breed - Lacaune, significantly decreases.

With the continuous development of science and technology, China's facility agriculture is advancing rapidly. Facility agriculture can overcome the impact of the natural environment and improve production efficiency. The development of facility agriculture is the only way for China to realize agricultural modernization. Greenhouses in China have been widely promoted, but the degree of automation is not high. The intelligent algorithms that appear in recent years do not rely on gradient information and other aux-iliary knowledge, but are suitable for solving large-scale complex problems. Therefore, the intelligent algorithm represented by genetic algorithm has become the main method for resource optimization. The purpose of this paper is to study the design of the multi-energy supply system based on the adaptive improved genetic algorithm for the intelligent control system of agricultural greenhouses. The related concepts of the improved genetic algorithm were introduced, and a framework was designed for the agricultural greenhouse control system. In order to verify the feasibility of the developed software and hardware, a greenhouse experiment platform was designed and improved in the laboratory, and the system designed in this paper was debugged and tested. The experimental results show that through intelligent control of agricultural greenhouses, the deviation of air temperature is less than 0.5 degrees C and the deviation of air humidity is less than 1% RH when stable. The value of carbon dioxide concentration after being basically stable has small fluctuations around the stable value, and the maximum relative fluctuation is less than 2.5%.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

The dwarf inanga Galaxias gracilis is restricted to 13 dune lakes along an 80 km length of coastline on the west coast of the North Island, New Zealand, and its abundance has declined in at least eight of these lakes. It is therefore a rare and endangered endemic species. 2. A range of environmental variables were compared between lakes where it is still common and lakes where it is now rare to identify variables associated with its low abundance. 3. Lakes where dwarf inanga were rare all had a lower pH, lower concentrations of calcium, magnesium and silica, and higher concentrations of chloride than lakes where dwarf inanga were common. In addition, they contained different charophyte plant species, as well as stocked populations of eels and/or introduced exotic fish species capable of preying on one or more of the life stages of dwarf inanga. 4. Factors not associated with the low abundance of dwarf inanga included lake size and depth, land use in the catchment, lake level fluctuations, the extent of emergent vegetation, littoral zone substrate composition, and water quality parameters including maximum water temperature, water transparency, and minimum oxygen levels in the hypolimnion. 5. The identification of factors associated with the low abundance of dwarf inanga has allowed testable hypotheses to be developed to account for its decline in certain lakes. However, biological data, particularly on the location of spawning grounds and on the feeding requirements of larvae, are required before all these hypotheses can be tested. 6. The results have formed the basis for a management plan for the conservation of this species, in which whole-lake experiments are being carried out to identify the effects of introduced plants and fish on its population size.

Green roofs with shallow growing media represent stressful conditions for plant survival, thus plants that survive and grow are important for maximizing economic and ecological benefits. While field trials are essential for selecting appropriate green roof plants, we wanted to determine whether plant leaf traits could predict changes in abundance ( growth) to provide a more general framework for plant selection. We quantified leaf traits and derived life-history traits ( Grime's C-S-R strategies) for 13 species used in a four-year green roof experiment involving five plant life forms. Changes in canopy density in monocultures and mixtures containing one to five life forms were determined and related to plant traits using multiple regression. We expected traits related to stress-tolerance would characterize the species that best grew in this relatively harsh setting. While all species survived to the end of the experiment, canopy species diversity in mixture treatments was usually much lower than originally planted. Most species grew slower in mixture compared to monoculture, suggesting that interspecific competition reduced canopy diversity. Species dominant in mixture treatments tended to be fast-growing ruderals and included both native and non-native species. Specific leaf area was a consistently strong predictor of final biomass and the change in abundance in both monoculture and mixture treatments. Some species in contrasting life-form groups showed compensatory dynamics, suggesting that life-form mixtures can maximize resilience of cover and biomass in the face of environmental fluctuations. This study confirms that plant traits can be used to predict growth performance in green roof ecosystems. While rapid canopy growth is desirable for green roofs, maintenance of species diversity may require engineering of conditions that favor less aggressive species.",,,,,,"Smith, Tyler William/0000-0001-7683-2653",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUN 30,2014,9,6,,,,,,,e101395,10.1371/journal.pone.0101395,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101395,,,,,,,,24978031,,,,,WOS:000338506400127,View Full Record in Web of Science

For example, the products of galactinol synthase (Gols) genes play a key role in regulating the levels of raffinose family oligosaccharides and conferring resistance to stress. We cloned and characterized three Gols genes in Salvia miltiorrhiza. Their expression followed three distinct patterns. Compared with the control, SmGols1 was up-regulated by temperature changes but was suppressed by exposure to methyl jasmonate or short-term drought. This gene had the greatest abundance of transcripts and was assigned a general function of carbon storage. SmGols2 responded to all stress and hormone treatments, and transcripts were maintained at a high level. Finally, expression of SmGols3 was weaker than the other two genes, but was increased significantly under different treatments. Over the experimental period, its expression declined to normal levels in response to all treatments except exposure to 100 mu M ABA, long-term drought, heat (42 degrees C), or chilling (8 degrees C). Based on our finding of cis-elements in the 5' flanking regions, we concluded that these genes seem to be regulated by several HSF transcription factors. We also targeted their 90-bp conserved sequences and used them for RNA interference analysis. Some were knocked down to various extents in our transgenic lines. Fluctuations in their malondialdehyde contents under different stress treatments, as well as the rate of water loss in transformed plants, suggested that lipid peroxidation was more likely to occur in the transgenics.than in the control. These results indicate that SmGols genes could have a main function in responding to cold or heat. Therefore, we believe that it is important to investigate this mechanism for tolerance in S. miltiorrhiza and to examine how expression of these SmGols and other homologs are influenced by abiotic stresses.

Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models have been extensively applied to study its energetics but such applications require a deep understanding of its nutrition, from filtration to assimilation. Being filter feeders, mussels show multiple responses to temporal fluctuations in their food and environment, raising questions that can be investigated by modeling. To provide a better insight into mussel-environment interactions, an experiment was conducted in one of the main French growing zones (Utah Beach, Normandy). Mussel growth was monitored monthly for 18 months, with a large number of environmental descriptors measured in parallel. Food proxies such as chlorophyll a, particulate organic carbon and phytoplankton were also sampled, in addition to non-nutritious particles. High-frequency physical data recording (e. g., water temperature, immersion duration) completed the habitat description. Measures revealed an increase in dry flesh mass during the first year, followed by a high mass loss, which could not be completely explained by the DEB model using raw external signals. We propose two methods that reconstruct food from shell length and dry flesh mass variations. The former depends on the inversion of the growth equation while the latter is based on iterative simulations. Assemblages of food proxies are then related to reconstructed food input, with a special focus on plankton species. A characteristic contribution is attributed to these sources to estimate nutritional values for mussels. M. edulis shows no preference between most plankton life history traits. Selection is based on the size of the ingested particles, which is modified by the volume and social behavior of plankton species. This finding reveals the importance of diet diversity and both passive and active selections, and confirms the need to adjust DEB models to different populations and sites.",,,,,,"Flye-Sainte-Marie, Jonathan/0000-0002-6462-0677; Le Gendre, Romain/0000-0001-7015-8290",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,OCT 23,2014,9,10,,,,,,,e109796,10.1371/journal.pone.0109796,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0109796,,,,,,,,25340793,,,,,WOS:000343662800018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many experiments performed with the help of various techniques since the mid 70s have demonstrated that native proteins, apart from the usual fast vibrational dynamics, reveal also a much slower activated dynamics of conformational transitions in the whole range of relaxation times from 10(-11) to 10(5) s or longer. At least in the range from 10(-11) to 10(-7) s the relaxation time spectrum is quasi-continuous and often has an approximate self-similarity symmetry (time scaling). Diffusion on fractal lattices is a particular model of stochastic dynamics displaying this property. Application of this model in construction of some elements of a novel theory of protein involving reactions is preceded by detailed analysis of the general concepts of the stochastic theory of reaction rates. Two kinds of experiments give especially strong grounds for the model of dynamics considered: small ligand rebinding to protein after laser flash photolysis and observations, with the help of the patch clamp technique, of fluctuations of the ionic current through single protein channels. Under special conditions realized in these experiments the initial conformational substates of the protein already belong to the transition state of the reaction. A theoretical model of such reactions is proposed, assuming that the reaction transition state is reduced to a single conformational substate (the gate). Computer simulations indicate predominance of the initial stage of the reaction proceeding according to the algebraic power law, over the final exponential stage. Simple formulae are proposed for description of the whole time course of the reaction and its variation with temperature.

Here we examine how the presence, absence and specific anatomical and histological characters of vertebral centra-associated elements can be used to define vertebral column regions in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). To investigate if the presence of regions within the vertebral column is independent of temperature, animals raised at 8 and 12 degrees C were studied at 1400 and 1530degreedays, in the freshwater phase of the life cycle. Anatomy and composition of the skeletal tissues of the vertebral column were analysed using Alizarin red S whole-mount staining and histological sections. Six regions, termed I-VI, are recognised in the vertebral column of specimens of both temperature groups. Postcranial vertebrae (region I) carry neural arches and parapophyses but lack ribs. Abdominal vertebrae (region II) carry neural arches and ribs that articulate with parapophyses. Elastic- and fibrohyaline cartilage and Sharpey's fibres connect the bone of the parapophyses to the bone of the ribs. In the transitional region (III) vertebrae carry neural arches and parapophyses change stepwise into haemal arches. Ribs decrease in size, anterior to posterior. Vestigial ribs remain attached to the haemal arches with Sharpey's fibres. Caudal vertebrae (region IV) carry neural and haemal arches and spines. Basidorsals and basiventrals are small and surrounded by cancellous bone. Preural vertebrae (region V) carry neural and haemal arches with modified neural and haemal spines to support the caudal fin. Ural vertebrae (region VI) carry hypurals and epurals that represent modified haemal and neural arches and spines, respectively. The postcranial and transitional vertebrae and their respective characters are usually recognised, but should be considered as regions within the vertebral column of teleosts because of their distinctive morphological characters. While the number of vertebrae within each region can vary, each of the six regions is recognised in specimens of both temperature groups. This refined identification of regionalisation in the vertebral column of Chinook salmon can help to address evolutionary developmental and functional questions, and to support applied research into this farmed species.",,,,,"Witten, Paul Eckhard/AAY-3113-2020; De Clercq, Adelbert/V-3894-2019","De Clercq, Adelbert/0000-0003-2670-1684; Witten, Paul Eckhard/0000-0002-2928-5762",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8782,1469-7580,,,,OCT,2017,231,4,,,,,500,514,,10.1111/joa.12655,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joa.12655,,,,,,,,28762509,,,,,WOS:000411100100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We monitored and conducted experiments on the major species in this ecosystem, except the large mammals (for logistic reasons). The central problem has been to determine the causes of the 9-10 year cycle of snowshoe hares, and to achieve this we carried out several large-scale experiments manipulating food supplies, predator pressure, and soil nutrient availability to test hypotheses that food, predation, or habitat quality regulate populations. The hare cycle is driven top-down by predators, and most hares die because they are killed by predators. Predators also cause stress in female hares, and the stress response seems to be responsible for the loss of reproductive potential in the decline and low phases of the hare cycle. Many of the specialist predators and some herbivores in this ecosystem fluctuate with the hare cycle. Arctic ground squirrels do, but red squirrels do not, being linked closely to white spruce seed masting years. Small rodents fluctuate in numbers in two patterns. Red-backed voles and four species of Microtus voles have a 3-4 year cycle that seems to be driven by food supplies and social behaviour. Deer mice, in contrast, have fluctuated dramatically in the 38 years we have monitored them, but not cyclically. White spruce seed production varies with temperature and rainfall, but was not affected by adding nutrients in fertilizer. Global warming and reduced hare browsing in the last 20 years have helped to increase the abundance of shrubs in these forests. It will be challenging to predict how this system will change as climatic warming proceeds, because even closely related species in the same trophic level respond differently to perturbations.

Advection of passive tracers in a periodically-driven flow consisting of a background stream and an eddy (the model inspired by the phenomenon of topographic eddies over mountains in the ocean and atmosphere) is analyzed as an example of chaotic particle's scattering and transport. A numerical analysis reveals a non-attracting chaotic invariant set K that determines scattering and trapping of particles from the incoming flow. It is shown that both the trapping time for particles in the mixing region and the number of times their trajectories wind around the vortex have hierarchical fractal structure as functions of the initial particle's coordinates. Scattering functions are singular on a Cantor set of initial conditions, and this property should manifest itself by strong fluctuations of quantities measured in experiments. The Lagrangian structures in our numerical experiments are shown to be similar to those found in a recent laboratory dye experiment at Woods Hole. Transport and mixing of passive particles is studied in the kinematic model inspired by the interaction of a current (like the Gulf Stream or the Kuroshio) with an eddy in a noisy environment. We demonstrate a non-trivial phenomenon of noise-induced clustering of passive particles and propose a method to find such clusters in numerical experiments. These clusters are patches of advected particles which can move together in a random velocity field for comparatively long time. The clusters appear due to existence of regions of stability in the phase space which is the physical space in the advection problem. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

The catalytic activity, thermal stability and tolerance to methanol and DMSO of the modified enzyme were all improved simultaneously. The optimum temperature changed from 55 to 60 celcius. The hydrophobicity and anion type of the modifier have important influence on the catalytic performance of CALB. CALB modified by [ProC(12)][H2PO4] has a better effect. Under the optimal conditions, its hydrolysis activity was 3.0 times than that of the native enzyme, the catalytic efficiency Kcat/Km improved 2.8 times in aqueous phase, and the tolerance to organic solvent with strong polarity (50% methanol 2 h) was increased by 6.8 times. Fluorescence spectra and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed that the introduction of ionic liquids changed the microenvironment near the fluorophores of the enzyme protein, the alpha-helix decreased and beta-sheet increased in the secondary structure of the modified enzymes. The root mean square deviation (RMSD), residue root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and solution accessible surface area (SASA) of [ProC(2)][Br]-CALB, [ProC(12)][Br]-CALB and native CALB were obtained for comparison by molecular dynamics simulation. The results of dynamics simulation were in good agreement with enzymology experiment. The introduction of ionic liquids can keep CALB in a better active conformation, and proline ionic liquids with long hydrophobic chains can significantly improve the surface hydrophobicity and overall rigidity of CALB.

We provide a direct comparison between both concepts, embedding the simulations into identical force fields and thermal fluctuations. The quantum simulations permit the estimation of coherence times and wave packet dispersions of a K(+)ion over a range of 0.5 nm (a range that covers almost 50% of the filter domains longitudinal extension). We find that this observed extension of particle delocalization changes the mean orientation of the coordinating carbonyl oxygen atoms significantly, transiently suppressing their 'caging action' responsible for selective ion coordination. Compared to classical MD simulations, this particular quantum effect allows the K(+)ions to 'escape' more easily from temporary binding sites provided by the surrounding filter atoms. To further elucidate the role of this observation for ion conduction rates, we compare the temporal pattern of single conduction events between classical MD and quantum QMD simulations at a femto-sec time scale. A finding from both approaches is that ion permeation follows a very irregular time pattern, involving flushes of permeation interrupted by non-conductive time intervals. However, as compared with classical behavior, the QMD simulation shortens non-conductive time by more than a half. As a consequence, and given the same force-fields, the QMD-simulated ion current appears to be considerably stronger as compared with the classical current. To bring this result in line with experimentally observed ion currents and the predictions based on Nernst-Planck theories, the conclusion is that a transient short time quantum behavior of permeating ions can successfully compromise high conduction rates with ion selectivity in the filter of channel proteins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-3417,,,,JUN,2020,10,12,,,,,,,4250,10.3390/app10124250,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10124250,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000554638500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Bamboos and other plants may substantially rely on stem water storage for transpiration. Fluctuations in wood water content (theta (wood)) may lead to errors when estimating transpiration based on sap flux (J (s)) measurements with the widely used thermal dissipation probe (TDP) method. To test the effects of theta (wood) on J (s), we conducted a culm dehydration experiment, monitored bamboos with TDPs, and implemented a steady-state thermal model. Based on the model simulation, a mathematical correction method was built. Central to the calculation of J (s), and thus a major potential source of error, is the maximum temperature difference between probes (Delta T (max)) which is often referred to as 'zero flow' conditions. In the culm dehydration experiment, we observed that Delta T (max) decreased when theta (wood) increased. In long-term field monitoring, Delta T (max) decreased when soil moisture content increased, potentially indicating changes in theta (wood) and a seasonal decrease in stem water storage. The steady-state model reproduced the theta (wood) to Delta T (max) relationship of the dehydration experiment and underlined a considerable sensitivity of J (s) estimates to theta (wood). Fluctuations in theta (wood) may lead to a substantial underestimation of J (s), and subsequently of transpiration, in commonly applied estimation schemes. However, our model results suggest that such underestimation can be quantified and subsequently corrected for with our correction equations when key wood properties are known.

The abundances and, for the first time, biomasses and secondary production rates of these communities were examined. The experimental set-up consisted of 300 brown plastic cups placed in temperate mixed forests and sampled five times over a period of 16 months to determine the impact of (i) seasonal events, (ii) physicochemical parameters, and (iii) food resources on the tree hole metazoans. Outcomes Metazoan organisms, especially the meiofauna (rotifers and nematodes) occupied nearly all of the cups (> 99%) throughout the year. Between 55% and 99% of themetazoan community was represented by rotifers (max. 557,000 individuals 100 cm(-2)) and nematodes (max. 58,000 individuals 100 cm(-2)). Diptera taxa, particularly Dasyhelea sp. (max. 256 individuals 100 cm(-2)) dominated the macrofaunal community. Macrofauna accounted for the majority of the metazoan biomass, with a mean dry weight of 5,800 mu g 100 cm(-2) and an annual production rate of 20,400 mu g C 100 cm(-2), whereas for meiofauna mean biomass and annual production were 100 mu g 100 cm(-2) and 5,300 mu g C 100 cm(-2), respectively. The macrofaunal taxa tended to show more fluctuating population dynamic while the meiofaunal dynamic was rather low with partly asynchronous development. Seasonality (average temperature and rain intervals) had a significant impact on both meiofauna and macrofauna. Furthermore, bottom-up control (chlorophyll-a and organic carbon), mainly attributable to algae, was a significant factor that shaped the metazoan communities.

Within temperate ecosystems, these conditions not only develop seasonally as temperatures rise and metabolic rates accelerate, but can also display strong diurnal variability, especially in shallow systems where photosynthetic rates ameliorate hypoxia and acidification by day. Despite the widespread, global co-occurrence of low pH and low DO and the likelihood that these conditions may negatively impact marine life, very few studies have actually assessed the extent to which the combination of both stressors elicits additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects in marine organisms. We review the evidence from published factorial experiments that used static and/or fluctuating pH and DO levels to examine different traits (e.g. survival, growth, metabolism), life stages and species across a broad taxonomic spectrum. Additive negative effects of combined low pH and low DO appear to be most common; however, synergistic negative effects have also been observed. Neither the occurrence nor the strength of these synergistic impacts is currently predictable, and therefore, the true threat of concurrent acidification and hypoxia to marine food webs and fisheries is still not fully understood. Addressing this knowledge gap will require an expansion of multi-stressor approaches in experimental and field studies, and the development of a predictive framework. In consideration of marine policy, we note that DO criteria in coastal waters have been developed without consideration of concurrent pH levels. Given the persistence of concurrent low pH-low DO conditions in estuaries and the increased mortality experienced by fish and bivalves under concurrent acidification and hypoxia compared with hypoxia alone, we conclude that such DO criteria may leave coastal fisheries more vulnerable to population reductions than previously anticipated.",,,,,"Baumann, Hannes/D-1435-2010","Baumann, Hannes/0000-0002-4039-4230",,,,,,,,,,,,,1744-9561,1744-957X,,,,MAY 1,2016,12,5,,,,,,,20150976,10.1098/rsbl.2015.0976,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2015.0976,,,,,,,,27146441,,,,,WOS:000378308800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Bradley, DC; Ormerod, SJ",,,,"Bradley, DC; Ormerod, SJ",,,Community persistence among stream invertebrates tracks the North Atlantic Oscillation,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) affects marine ecosystems, lakes and some terrestrial ecosystems around the Atlantic rim, but evidence for effects on rivers is scarce. For 14 years, we sampled riverine macroinvertebrates in eight independent streams from the Llyn Brianne experimental catchments in central Wales. We assessed whether year-to-year persistence in rank abundance and species composition tracked the NAO. 2. Persistence was quasi-cyclical and varied synchronously across all streams, irrespective of chemistry and catchment land use. Invertebrate communities in all stream types or habitats switched significantly from being highly persistent during negative phases of the NAO (winter index <1 = cold, dry winters) to unstable during positive phases (>1 = mild, wet winters). These effects occurred in both rare and common taxa. 3. Acid episodes could not explain low persistence in positive NAO years because variations in acid-base status were not linked to the NAO. Moreover, fluctuations in persistence were apparent even in well-buffered streams. 4. Discharge in adjacent gauged catchments increased in positive NAO years by 15-18% but neither flow variability nor flow maxima were higher. Nor were variations in invertebrate persistence at Llyn Brianne directly correlated with discharge pattern. Discharge variations alone were therefore insufficient to explain links between persistence and the NAO, but we cannot exclude subtle effects due either to flow or temperature. 5.

One of the most important zeitgeber to time reproduction is the photoperiod, but further environmental cues are assessed to fine-tune reproduction due to year-to-year variation in environmental conditions. However, in urbanized environments, the pervasive artificial light at night has altered the natural signal of light and darkness. Accordingly, artificial light at night was repeatedly shown to affect avian reproductive physiology and to advance seasonal reproduction in birds. However, these experiments were mainly conducted in the absence of further environmental cues to facilitate the investigation of the mechanisms which are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate whether the endocrine system of free-ranging European blackbirds (Turdus merula) correlates with the amount of artificial light at night along a rural to urban gradient while the birds still encounter complementary environmental cues including seasonal variation in day length and temperature. Testosterone and estrone were assessed as metabolites in fecal samples and corticosterone in blood from mist-netted blackbirds. We demonstrate that seasonal fluctuations in abiotic factors, individual conditions, but also light at night affect the reproductive and stress physiology of wild European blackbirds. Elevated artificial night light intensities were significantly positively correlated with corticosterone and negatively with female estrone levels. No effects of artificial light were found for testosterone levels. Our results suggest that female blackbirds in particular perceive even low levels of artificial light at night as a weak but chronic stressor that interacts with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and leads to a reduced secretion of reproductive hormones. These findings point out that the impacts of light pollution are diverse and we only slowly disentangle its multiple effects on physiology, ecology, and biodiversity.",,,,,"Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014; Klenke, Reinhard/J-4686-2013; Russ, Anja/D-4797-2015","Klenke, Reinhard/0000-0002-6860-8085; Russ, Anja/0000-0002-6236-5828",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,DEC,2015,5,23,,,,,5698,5710,,10.1002/ece3.1820,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1820,,,,,,,,27069618,,,,,WOS:000367433000023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hence, experiments were performed to analyze variations in haemoglobin structure and patterns of three strains of Artemia from South India and also to reflect the effect of varying oxygen levels in their habitat. Haemoglobins were purified on a DEAE-Sephadex column and haemoglobin types were analyzed by comparing their relative mobility on a non-denaturing medium. Furthermore, their molecular masses were determined by gel filtration in Sepharose column and by dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Results clearly reveal the presence of three distinct extracellular haemoglobins Hb I, Hb II and Hb III in Tuticorin strain while the other strains displayed only trails or the complete absence of Hb III and Hb II. Estimated molecular masses of these haemoglobins are 235,000-250,000 Da. Denaturation of the reduced and alkylated haemoglobins revealed apparently one polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of 124,000 Da. Upon denaturing gel electrophoresis of native haemoglobin Hb H, it was found that the 124,000 Da, polypeptide was cleaved specifically into two unequally-sized fragments of 50,400 and 79,800 Da. With regard to oxygen affinity, Hb III has a very high affinity for oxygen, an almost negligible Bohr effect and a good physiological adaptation to temperature changes. By combining the three haemoglobins in different proportions Artemia strains must be able to withstand diverging environmental conditions. In particular, the absence of Hb III in Puthalam and its occurrence as a faint band in Thamaraikulam could be correlated to the oxygen levels of their habitats. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A selection of microalgal species were used, all, being identified as bloom-forming dinoflagellates: Prorocentrum donghaiense Lu sp., Alexandrium tamarense (Lebour) Balech, Amphidinium carterae Hulburt and Scrippsiella trochoide (Stein) Loeblich III. Results showed that the fresh thalli of either U. pertusa or G. lemaneiformis significantly inhibited the microalgal growth, or caused mortality at the end of the experiment. However, the overall effects of the macroalgal culture filtrates on the growth of the dinoflagellates were species-specific (inhibitory, stimulatory or none) for different microalgal species. Results indicated an allelopathic effect of macroalga on the co-cultured dinoflagellate. We then took P. donghaiense as an example to further assess this hypothesis. The present study was carried out under controlled conditions, thereby excluded the fluctuation in light and temperature. Nutrient assays showed that nitrate and phosphate were almost exhausted in G. lemaneiformis co-culture. but remained at enough high levels in U pertusa co-culture, which were well above the nutrient limitation for the microalgal growth, when all cells of P. donghaiense were killed in the co-culture. Daily f/2 medium enrichment greatly alleviated the growth inhibition on P. donghaiense in G. lemaneiformis co-culture, but could not eliminate it. Other environmental factors, such as carbonate limitation, bacterial presence and the change of pH were also not necessary for the results. We thus concluded that allelopathy was the most possible reason leading to the negative effect of U. pertusa on P. donghaiense, and the combined roles of allelopathy and nutrient competition were essential for the effect of G. lemaneiformis on P. donghaiense.

After that, parameter values are calibrated using sampling ratios, spatial scales and neighborhood structures. Finally, the model is applied to the simulation of oil slick in DeepSpill project. Experiments showed that (1) higher sampling ratio will help to obtain better parameter values. However, when sampling ratio exceeds 10%, improvement is small in overall accuracy. In addition, suitable proportion of oil areas in training sample can help to get better results. It can be seen from parameter values that distance is the most important factor, followed by currents, wind, salinity and temperature. (2) Overall accuracy of simulation results has fluctuation characteristics in different spatial scales. In experiments of extended neighborhood, accuracy first increases and then decreases with increase of neighborhood size. This model yields the best simulation result in 7 x 7 Moore neighborhood, which can reach 97.40%.

Previous studies were little focused on the responses of dryland wheat productivity to the structural changes in ridge-furrow plastic mulching (RFM) system and its mechanism in semiarid eastern African Plateau (EAP). A two-year field experiment was conducted in Juja, a semiarid area in Kenya from 2015 to 2016. There were seven treatments of ridge furrow width and ratios in randomized block design as follows: (1) 40 cm ridge width and 20 cm furrow width (R4F2, the same below), (2) R3F2, (3) R2F2, (4) R3F4, (5) R2F4, (6) R3F6 and (7) R2F6, and conventional flat planting without mulching as control (CK). The results showed that R4F2, R3F2, R2F2, R3F4 and R2F4 treatments significantly improved soil water storage and temperature across two growing seasons compared with CK (P < 0.05). Among all the treatments, R3F2 and R2F2 obviously achieved the highest plant height, leaf area, aboveground biomass (AgB), grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE) (P < 0.05). Also, R2F2 had the highest economic benefits in all treatments. The optimal ridge-furrow ratio appeared to be 1.32-1.38, 1.28-1.31, 1.39-1.49, 1.37-1.45 and 1.46-1.56 for wheat yield, AgB, WUEY, WUEB and harvest index (HI), respectively. In addition, wheat yield, AgB, WUE and HI tended to decrease linearly with the increased ridge-furrow unit size. In conclusion, ridge-furrow ratio of 1-1.5 (R2F2 to R3F2) in combination with the minimum ridge-furrow unit size proved to be the optimum RFM system for the best dryland wheat productivity in accordance to regional soil and climate characteristics in semiarid EAP and other similar areas of the world.",,,,,"Duan, Hai-Xia/ACF-8164-2022; Mo, Fei/R-5645-2017","Zhou, Rui/0000-0001-6072-8464; Mo, Fei/0000-0002-7538-0453",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-3774,1873-2283,,,,APR 30,2021,249,,,,,,,,106813,10.1016/j.agwat.2021.106813,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2021.106813,,FEB 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000629261400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Chemical control is the main control method against B. tabaci; biological control practices, however, have also been applied against this pest, especially in greenhouse production systems. Due to its parasitism potential and adaptation to environmental conditions of the Mediterranean region, Eretmocerus mundus Mercet (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) is considered one of the most successful biological control agents of B. tabaci. In mass production, having adequate numbers of natural enemies is critical for the augmentative biological control programs. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of stored indigenous Er. mundus on B. tabaci under greenhouse conditions. In storage experiments, red-eyed Er. mundus pupae were stored separately for 4, 8 and 12 days at 5 and 10 degrees C with 45 +/- 5% RH conditions. The most suitable storage duration and temperature were determined as 8 days and 10 degrees C for the greenhouse release experiments. In the greenhouse experiments, the treatments consisted of B. tabaci release (control), stored and unstored Er. mundus releases in the Spring of 2015 and 2016 growth seasons. For the evaluation of population development of whitefly and the parasitoid, leaf samples were taken at five-day intervals. In both years, similar parasitism fluctuations were detected in stored and unstored parasitoid-released treatments, wherein initially-lower parasitism rates showed a dramatic increase at later sampling dates. In general, statistical parasitism rates of stored and unstored Er. mundus populations were found in the same group for 2015 and 2016. The results showed that storage of the parasitoid did not have a negative effect on its parasitism ability, and eight-day-stored native strain of Er. mundus could be used successfully in the biological control of B. tabaci in greenhouse-grown tomato plants.",,,,,"Döker, İsmail/E-5403-2018","Döker, İsmail/0000-0002-1412-1554",,,,,,,,,,,,,0261-2194,1873-6904,,,,NOV,2020,137,,,,,,,,105293,10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105293,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105293,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000566399800027,View Full Record in Web of Science

To evaluate the potential hazards in a spill accident both experiments and simulations are performed. In the present work, the CFD code, ADREA-HF, is used to simulate the liquefied hydrogen (LH2) spill experiments (test 5, 6, 7) conducted by the Health Safety Laboratory (HSL). Two horizontal releases, the one along the ground and the other one at a distance above the ground, and one vertical release are examined with spill rate 60 lt/min. The main focus of this study is on the presence of humidity in the atmosphere and its effect on the vapor dispersion. When humidity is present is cooled, condenses and freezes due to the low prevailing temperature (similar to 20 K near the release), and releases heat. In addition, during the release hydrogen droplets are formed due to mechanical and flashing breakup, and water droplets and ice crystals due to humidity phase change. Therefore, two models are tested: the hydrodynamic equilibrium model, which assumes that the phases are in thermodynamic and kinematic equilibrium and the non hydrodynamic equilibrium model (slip model), which assumed that the phases are in thermodynamic equilibrium but they can obtain different velocities. The fluctuating wind direction was also taken into account, since it greatly affects the hydrogen dispersion. The computational results are compared with the experimental measurements, and it is concluded that humidity along with the slip effect influences the buoyancy of the cloud to a great extent. The best simulation case (humidity and slip effect) is consistent with the experiment for all three tests for the majority of the sensors. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Mixtures of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover cultivars with different leaf sizes, cvs. Alice, Gwenda and Retor, were evaluated for white clover persistence at two cutting frequencies. Stolen dynamics, stolen survival, leaf and node appearance rate, branching, flowering and stolen elongation rate were analysed and related to white clover content and yield. There were clear seasonal fluctuations in stolen and leaf characteristics. Stolen elongation rate and appearance rates of nodes, leaves and branches declined in autumn. Temperature and irradiation explained a major part of the variation of stolen elongation rate and leaf appearance rate and 25% of the variation in stolen branching rate. Significant and consistent differences in yield and botanical composition were found between mixtures. Mixtures with cv. Alice had the highest total and white clover yield and the highest white clover content, whereas mixtures with cv. Retor had the lowest yield and the lowest white clover content. Stolen elongation rate and stolen internee length were significantly higher in cv. Alice than in the other white clover cultivars, whereas cv.

On a short temporal scale, mean CR response of both species to 0.06 mu g L(-1) chlorophyll a (Chl a) and 0.23 mg L(-1) suspended particulate matter (SPM) remained constant despite large intra-individual fluctuations in CR.

We investigate in an intermediate-complexity climate model the applicability of linear response theory (LRT) to the assessment of a geoengineering method. This application of LRT is twofold. First, our objective (01) is to assess only the best possible geoengineering scenario by looking for a suitable modulation of solar forcing that can cancel out or otherwise modulate a climate change signal that would result from a rise in carbon dioxide concentration [CO2] alone. Here, we consider only the cancellation of the expected global mean surface air temperature A([Ts]). It is in fact a straightforward inverse problem for this solar forcing, and, considering an infinite time period, we use LRT to provide the solution in the frequency domain in closed form as JS(o)= (6.([Ts])(0)) xg(c))f,(0)))1x,(0)), where the X's are linear susceptibilities. We provide procedures suitable for numerical implementation that apply to finite time periods too. Second, to be able to utilize LRT to quantify side -effects, the response with respect to uncontrolled observables, such as regional averages (T,), must be approximately linear. Therefore, our objective (02) here is to assess the linearity of the response. We find that under geoengineering in the sense of (01), i.e., under combined greenhouse and required solar forcing, the asymptotic response A ( [ Ts]) is actually not zero. This turns out not to be due to nonlinearity of the response under geoengineering, but rather a consequence of inaccurate determination of the linear susceptibilities X. The error is in fact due to a significant quadratic nonlinearity of the response under system identification achieved by a forced experiment. This nonlinear contribution can be easily removed, which results in much better estimates of the linear susceptibility, and, in turn, in a fivefold reduction in A ([ Ts]) under geoengineering practice. This correction dramatically improves also the agreement of the spatial patterns of the predicted linear and the true model responses.

For this, we develop a dynamical firn-compaction model that includes meltwater retention. Based on the ASIRAS data, which show internal layers as annual horizons in the uppermost firn, the method relies on inferring the age/depth (internal layers) information from the radar data using a Monte Carlo inversion technique to tune in parallel both the firn model and the atmospheric forcing parameters (temperature and accumulation). The model is validated against two firn cores, and it is shown that applying both firn densities and age/depth information for the inversion gives the most accurate understanding of model biases. The method is then applied to a 67 km section of the EGIG line forced by atmospheric output from a regional climate model using only age/depth information in the inversion step. The layers traced by the ASIRAS data are modeled with a root-mean-square error of 9 cm, which is within the estimated error of the layer tracing.

To accentuate the vertical light gradient, enclosures had black walls, resulting in a euphotic depth of only 3.7 m. All enclosures were placed in a well-mixed water bath to equalize temperature across treatments. Phytoplankton responded to an initial phosphorus pulse with a transient increase in biomass, which was highest in the shallowest, least light-limited water columns where dissolved mineral phosphorus subsequently became strongly limiting. As a consequence, the depth-averaged mineral phosphorus concentration increased and the seston carbon (C) : phosphorous (P) ratio decreased with increasing water-column depth. Low turbulence enclosures became quickly dominated by motile taxa (flagellates) in the upper water column, whereas mixed enclosures became gradually dominated by pennate diatoms, which resulted in higher average sedimentation rates in the mixed enclosures over the 35-d experimental period. Low turbulence enclosures showed pronounced vertical structure in water columns >4 m, where diversity was higher than in mixed enclosures, suggesting vertical niche partitioning.

In the present study, we contrasted the degree of condition dependence in three morphological traits of male Drosophila bipectinata: two secondary sexual traits (distinct components of the sex comb), one of which significantly predicts mating success in nature (segment 2), whereas the other does not (segment 1), and a nonsecondary sexual trait (sternopleural bristle number). As predicted, comb segment 2 decreased significantly in size, in response to increasing temperature during development, whereas comb segment 1 and sternopleural bristle number either did not change significantly, or increased with increasing temperature. These results support the hypothesis that condition-dependence, inferred from stress-induced reductions in trait expression, engenders a trait to sexual selection. Small-combed genotypes did not exhibit disproportionate reductions in larva-to-adult survivorship and adult body size compared to large-combed genotypes, suggesting that comb size does not reveal genotypic quality, at least as revealed by sensitivity in body size and juvenile survivorship to thermal stress.

Flow reduction did not result in significant lowering of temperature or formation of surface or subsurface ice. The main findings were (1) daily movement by S. fontinalis increased (c. 2.5-fold) during flow reduction, but was limited to small-scale relocations (< 10 m). (2) Undercut banks were the preferred habitat and availability of these habitats was reduced during flow reduction. (3) Although both experimental and reference fish did lose mass and condition during the experiment, no effects of flow reduction on stress indicators (blood cortisol or glucose) or bioenergetics (total body fat, water content or mass loss) were detected, probably because access to the preferred type of cover remained available. Like other salmonids, S. fontinalis moves little and seeks physical cover during winter. Unlike many of the more studied salmonids, however, this species overwinters successfully in small groundwater-rich streams that often remain ice-free, and this study identifies undercut banks as the critical winter habitat rather than substratum cover.

Rainfed crops are being challenged by an upward trend in evaporative demand as average temperatures rise and, in many regions, there is an increased irregularity and a downward trend in rainfall. In addition, irrigated cropping faces declining water availability and increased competition from other users. Crop WUE would be improved by, first, ensuring that as much water as possible is actually transpired by the crop rather than being wasted. Deeper roots and greater early crop vigour are two traits that should help achieve this. Crop WUE would also be improved by achieving greater biomass per unit water transpired. A host of traits has been proposed to address this outcome. Restricting crop transpiration through lower stomatal conductance is assessed as having limited utility compared with traits that improve carbon gain, such as enhancements to photosynthetic biochemistry and responsiveness, or greater mesophyll conductance. Ultimately, the most useful outcomes for improved crop WUE will probably be achieved by combining traits to achieve synergistic benefit.

Here, we review phylogenetic and molecular data from extant members of the green plant clade (Chlorobionta) and show that the capacity to synthesize the monomeric precursors of all four biopolymers is ancestral and extends in some cases to unicellular plants (e.g. Chlamydomonas).

While the observed oscillations at these locations have similar wave periods ranging from 30 to 85 days, their forcing mechanisms can involve different dynamic processes. In order to clarify the dynamic processes essential for the observed intraseasonal signals, the authors adopted in this study a fine-resolution 1 1/2-layer reduced-gravity model and carried out a series of model experiments by varying coastline geometry and surface wind forcing. From these carefully designed experiments, they show that the intense 50-day oscillations observed at the entrance of Celebes Sea are a result of Rossby wave resonance in which the frequency of cyclonic eddy shedding by the retroflecting Mindanao Current matches that of the gravest Rossby mode of the semi-enclosed Celebes Sea basin. These 50-day oscillations of the Celebes Sea have a large impact on the throughflow in the Makassar Strait and Banda Sea, but do not contribute significantly to the throughflow changes in the Lombok, Ombai, and Timer Straits. The observed intraseasonal signals along the Sumatra/Java coasts in the eastern Indian Ocean are dominated by oscillations with wave periods of 50 and 85 days. The origin of these wave signals can be traced back to the central equatorial Indian Ocean where the surface zonal wind fluctuates intraseasonally with the same wave periods. The remotely induced coastal Kelvin waves along the Sumatra/Java coasts strongly influence the Lombok Strait, but exert no direct influence upon the Ombai and Timer Straits farther to the east; the gap of the Lombok Strait is found to conduit the Kelvin wave signals effectively into the Makassar Strait and the Banda Sea. The intraseasonal signals observed in the Timer Passage have a dominant wave period of 30-35 days. The model simulation further suggests the presence of a second spectral peak around 85 days. Both of these intraseasonal signals are attributable to the local, along-archipelago wind near the Timer Passage.",,,,,"Qiu, Bo/D-9569-2017","Kashino, Yuji/0000-0001-8841-6526",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,,,,,JUL,1999,29,7,,,,,1599,1618,,10.1175/1520-0485(1999)029<1599:IVITIP>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(1999)029<1599:IVITIP>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081739100014,View Full Record in Web of Science

We experimentally generated different seasonal phenotypes in the lab by altering photoperiodic conditions during rearing, and released the resulting butterflies in the field. Mark-recapture studies were then used to estimate the effects of the polyphenism on activity patterns and adult survival in both late-spring (one study) and summer (two studies) conditions. There were no significant effects of rearing treatment on temporal patterns of behavioral activity during either the late-spring or the summer field studies. Recapture probabilities were consistently higher for males than females in all three field studies; in the summer 1992 study, recapture probabilities were higher for long-day (LD) than for short-day (SD) treatment groups.

The consistent differences in survival probabilities between treatment groups in the summer 1992 study can be accounted for by the differences in wing traits between the treatment groups.

The solubility of the hemoglobin is increased at all temperatures, and is about 29 g/dl at 25 degrees C. Polymerization kinetics, induced by laser photolysis and observed by light-scattering intensity, showed exponential growth with rates about 300 times slower than experiments done on similar concentrations of HbS. When polymerization is carried out in small volumes, the time of measurable light-scattering signal to reach one-tenth of its final value (denoted as the tenth time) showed stochastic fluctuations, as is seen in pure HbS. Homogeneous nucleation rates were measured by observing distributions of tenth times and these rates were slowed by the mutation by almost 1000-fold relative to pure HbS. The kinetics, including the exponential progress curves and shape of the tenth time distributions, are well described by the double nucleation mechanism for polymerization. Analysis of the homogeneous nucleation rates leads to the surprising conclusion that the mutation has scarcely changed the energy of the intermolecular contacts despite the increase in solubility of the double mutant. This conclusion is supported by the stereochemistry of the modified contact site, in which the amount of exposed hydrophobic surface appears to be unchanged by the mutation. The increased solubility must therefore result from decreased motional freedom of molecules within the polymer, which could arise from tighter packing into the enlarged receptor pocket. This points up the ability of kinetic analysis to reveal important thermodynamic properties of assembly, and underlines the importance of the vibrational degrees of freedom in setting the final equilibrium constant. Chemical modifications to restrict vibrations and enhance the cost of polymerization may prove useful in constructing compounds to act as inhibitors of sickle cell gelation.

Screen-Aided CO2 Control (SACC) technology uses much less CO2 per experiment and per replicate than FACE and is superior to OTCs in terms of its effects on microclimate. A SACC unit consists of a thin metal frame, a clear plastic ''screen'', and a pipe at the base of the screen through which CO2 enriched jets of air are directed into the unit. There is a gap between the ground and the bottom of the pipe and the screen is relatively short in comparison to the maximum height of the vegetation. Our SACC units are hexagonal and enclose a ground area of 1.27 m(2). SACC works in the following way: 1) the screen breaks the wind and creates turbulent mixing within the unit, 2) the mixing of the outside air with the CO2 enriched jets of air,generates relatively uniform CO2 concentrations within the screened-in vegetation, and 3) a fully automated system monitors CO2 concentrations and adjusts CO2 injection rates for each unit every ca. IO minutes to maintain preset CO2 concentrations. Twenty-four hour means of CO2 concentrations in the middle of a unit are typically maintained within 1 mu l l(-1) of their set points. Spatial variation and short-term fluctuations in CO2 concentration are similar to those in OTCs and FACE. CO2 consumption at our site is 5 kg CO2 day(-1) replicate(-1) for a total of ca. 30 tons per year for 20 elevated CO2 SACC units. Compared to OTCs, SACC units have reduced temperature peaks at full sunlight, minimal effects on solar radiation, reduced rainfall interception by chamber walls, and freer access of small animals to experimental plots.

Adult flies aged 4, 16, 30 and 44 days were subjected to acute and chronic cold stress, and data confirmed a strong decline in cold tolerance and resilience of old flies compared to young counterparts. Using quantitative target GC-MS analysis, we found distinct metabolic phenotypes between young (4 day-old) and old (44 day-old) flies, with glycolytic pathways being differentially affected between the two age groups. We also compared the robustness of metabolic homeostasis in young vs. old flies when exposed to cold stress using time-series metabolic analysis. In both age groups, we found evidence of strong alteration of metabolic profiles when flies were exposed to low temperature stress. Interestingly, the temporal metabolic trajectories during the recovery period were similar in young and old flies, despite strong differences in thermotolerance. In conclusion, metabolic signatures markedly changed with age and homeostenosis was observed in the phenotypic response to cold stress. However, these changes did not reflect in different temporal homeostatic response at metabolic level.",,,,,"colinet, hervé/K-8768-2019","RENAULT, David/0000-0003-3644-1759",,,,,,,,,,,,,0531-5565,1873-6815,,,,FEB,2018,102,,,,,,43,50,,10.1016/j.exger.2017.08.021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2017.08.021,,,,,,,,28822810,,,,,WOS:000424922800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Both species continuously occupy a large heath area, Dwingelder Veld (1600 ha), in The Netherlands, and are studied there in the same localities with the same methods. Of the adults of C. melanocephalus, 90% do not cover more than 2 ha during the entire reproductive season, while 90% of adults of P. versicolor cover no more than 12 ha. In C. melanocephalus egg production in the field is usually similar to that under optimal feeding conditions in the laboratory, but in P. versicolor egg production seems to be much lower in the field. In the field 70-80% of the eggs most probably are killed by eelworms, followed by more than 90% mortality among the remaining larvae. Comparing mortality of developmental stages in laboratory experiments with that in field experiments in enclosures, it appears that mortality of larvae is not density-dependent, even when density in the experiments is much higher than it ever is in the field. Larval mortality mainly results from the poor ability of the larvae to find prey, even when in field experiments prey density is increased far above natural densities. We discuss why these poor prey-finding abilities are not improved by natural selection. In the spring breeder P. versicolor differences between localities both in abiotic factors, soil moisture and surface temperature, and biotic factors, reactions of prey species to abiotic factors, in spring and summer when the larvae are maturing contribute to the asynchronous fluctuations of numbers between subpopulations. In the autumn breeder C. melanocephalus possible differences in biotic factors between sites are outnumbered by the effects of winters with a higher or lower than normal amount of precipitation respectively. During a wet winter mortality among the larvae is much higher than during a dry winter. As these winter conditions are similar over large areas (many km2) the fluctuations of numbers between subpopulations are synchronous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,JUN,1992,90,3,,,,,340,352,,10.1007/BF00317690,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317690,,,,,,,,28313520,,,,,WOS:A1992HW29400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The relative compaction, optimum moisture content, and type of soil everything have an influ-ence on bearing capacity. A good subgrade can withstand a large amount of loading without an excessive deformation. When subjected to heavy moisture or freezing temperatures, most soils experience some volume change. In case of pavement, highway pavements eventually rest on native soil, the subgrade serves as the foundation material for the pavement construction (subgrade). As a result, the features of subgrade have an impact on the performance of pavement. It is therefore critical for an engineer to com-prehend the precise nature of the relationship between subgrade strength and settlement characteristics due to moisture fluctuation. This paper represents that the soil sample taken in and around southern part of Kangeyam block (Kangeyam, Ganapathipalayam, Alangadu, Sampanthanpalayam, Sivanmalai, Periyailliyam, Padiyur, Veeranaampalayam, Vattamalai, Aratholuvu) was tested and experimented for its index and engineering properties. The index properties test includes specific gravity, sieve analysis, OMC (optimum moisture content) and MDD (maximum dry density) was conducted for classification of soil. Since the soil samples collected was predominantly identified sand of various gradation, the engi-neering properties test such as direct shear test was conducted to evaluate their shear strength proper-ties. The subgrade strength of the soil samples was estimated by conducting CBR (California Bearing Ratio) test. In addition, the settlement of soil samples was evaluated as flexible pavement. The results of the tests data were entered in GIS (Geographical Information System) to describe the data as spatial representation mapping for the zone.

The effects of litter on seedling emergence (e.g. during succession from grassland to woodland) may not only depend on litter amount and environmental conditions but may also be related to litter types. We tested the effect of litter types, litter cover and soil moisture on the emergence of four congeneric pairs of grassland and woodland species. 2. We carried out a controlled pot experiment (Experiment I) using litter and species from two habitats (grassland vs. woodland), three levels of litter cover (low, medium, high) and two levels of water-addition (leading to constantly humid or intermittently dry substrate). Amounts of litter were adjusted to result in the same relative light reduction for both litter types. Consequently, we applied 2 g, 4 g and 8 g of grassland litter and 0.5 g, 1 g and 2 g of woodland (oak) litter per pot. 3. To separate the shade effect of litter from its mechanical plus chemical effects we exposed additional pots with seeds of the same species to deep shade conditions (Experiment II) corresponding to 4 g and 1 g of grass and oak litter, respectively. 4. Under intermittently dry conditions both litter types increased seedling emergence. In addition, we found a significant interaction between litter type and species origin: seedling emergence of woodland species was significantly lower from beneath grass litter than from beneath oak litter, whereas grassland species emerged equally well from beneath both litter types. Compared with seed germination under a shade cloth, seedling emergence of woodland species from beneath grass litter was reduced by 44%. Litter significantly affected soil humidity and the amplitude of diurnal temperature fluctuations. Differential effects of litter types on woodland and grassland species are probably related to litter structure. 5. Synthesis.

This is the first study to simulate an anorexic, mixed-sex, group-wise freshwater migration (2 weeks; 689 km) and subsequent seawater migration (9 weeks; 3,103 km) under mimicked photothermal conditions, using farmed silver eels. Silver eels swam under an 8 hour light: 16 hour dark regime in freshwater at 11.5 degrees C, and subsequently in complete darkness in seawater at daily fluctuating temperatures between 11.7 degrees C and 10.1 degrees C mimicking the vertical migrations in the Atlantic Ocean. The aim of these two consecutive experiments was to determine the effects of a simulated reproductive migration on the progression of sexual maturation. The freshwater migration significantly increased plasma testosterone levels in both migrating males and females, but did not enhance sexual maturation further as no significant increases in gonad weight, gonadosomatic index (GSI) nor eye index (EI) were observed. The subsequent seawater migration significantly increased gonad weight and GSI of the migrant males and, particularly, of the females (1.40 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.00 +/- 0.10%) vs. control groups, suggesting advancement of maturation. Also EI was significantly higher in migrant males (14.0 +/- 0.6) as compared to their controls (12.3 +/- 0.4). Plasma levels of the gonadotropins FSH and LH remained near the detection limits of the assays and levels were not elevated in migrating eels. These results show that simulation of migration under mimicked photothermal conditions has significant stimulating effects on early maturation which are presumably under steroid control. This brings farmed silver eels to a similar state of maturity as their wild conspecifics that are ready to embark on their oceanic migration. Simulated migration may therefore be used to condition farmed eels for the use as broodstock eels for further hormonal stimulation with gonadotropins in maturation protocols. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Cut herbage was analysed for dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC), neutral and acid detergent fibre (aNDF, ADF), in vitro true digestibility (IVTD), toughness and particle size. The experiment was repeated on two consecutive days. Diurnal variation of temperature, relative humidity and photosynthetic radiation were recorded every 5 min with an automated weather station. To characterize the relationship between dependent variables, Pearson correlations were performed. From 06:50 to 19:25 h, DM, TNC and the proportion of small particles (<1 mm) increased (P<0.05), CP, aNDF, ADF, toughness and proportion of large particles (>4.75 mm) decreased (P<0.05) while IVTD remained constant (P>0.05).

Results suggest an effect of time of day on herbage toughness and particle size as a function of increases in DM concentration, and reductions of aNDF and ADF concentrations, due to an increase in TNC.

The major objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of season, soil compaction by mechanical harvesting and soil cultivation on soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) during the early stages of a second-rotation (2R) hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii) plantation. Soil (0-10 cm depth) was sampled for 14 consecutive months in an established factorial field trial at Yarraman, southeast Queensland. There were three compaction treatments (0 forwarder pass, I forwarder pass and 16 forwarder passes) and two cultivation treatments (zero cultivation and disc plough), which were randomly arranged in three blocks. There was seasonal and spatial variation in soil microbial biomass in mineral soils among the different compaction and cultivation treatments, with soil microbial biomass C (MBC) ranging from 167 to 1149 mug g(-1), microbial biomass N (MBN) from 16 to 257 mug g(-1), and microbial C:N ratios from 4.0 to 14.6. Fluctuations in soil microbial biomass were mainly driven by the seasonal changes in environmental conditions (including rainfall, temperature and soil moisture). The MBC was less variable with season than the MBN. In general, seasonal fluctuations in MBN were similar amongst the treatments with an apparent peak in August (late winter), followed by a sharp decrease to a lowest point in October (mid-spring), and then a second peak in December (early summer). Soil compaction did not significantly affect MBC and MBN, while soil cultivation significantly reduced MBC and MBN only in the 0 forwarder pass for the experimental period except February and March 2001 (summer-early spring) for MBC and January-March 2001 (summer-early spring) for MBN. The potential mechanisms for the diverse impacts of soil compaction and cultivation on soil microbial processes are discussed in relation to the seasonal environmental changes. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Two of the streams had a history of fluctuating discharge and temperature while the others did not. Recovery from disturbance was tested experimentally using baskets of cobbles, a third of which were disturbed every week for 9 weeks, a further third every 3 weeks and the final third left undisturbed. Algal biomass, number of invertebrate taxa and total number of invertebrates all declined in baskets disturbed more frequently. Although the relative abundance of some taxa declined with time since the last disturbance, no taxa showed a significant decline in absolute abundance. However, several taxa showed marked increases in relative abundance in the less disturbed treatments particularly at the more stable sites. In contrast to the predictions of ecological theory, numbers of taxa and total invertebrates appeared to recover more quickly in the more complex communities at the stable sites. However, if these communities are considered to represent only stable communities, they do support the view that more complex communities will be more resilient. Community structure at the stable sites was also more similar between baskets in the undisturbed treatment than at the unstable sites, suggesting communities had reached a constant state more quickly. The more rapid recovery of communities measured at the stable sites may have been a consequence of experimental scale; disturbed patches were only 0.045 m(2) in area and the higher densities of invertebrates at the stable sites meant a larger pool of colonists was available following each experimental disturbance. Nevertheless, ideas of stability in ecological theory and the scale of most spate events suggest this is the appropriate scale for examining community recovery. Furthermore, the larger pool of available colonists could not explain all the differences in community response, as patterns of change in community structure at the stable sites differed consider ably more from those expected by purely random colonisation processes than at the unstable sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,NOV,1996,108,3,,,,,567,576,,10.1007/BF00333735,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00333735,,,,,,,,28307875,,,,,WOS:A1996VW51200022,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, such effects are often not well understood, partly because they can be difficult to distinguish from impacts of environmental fluctuations. We evaluated the effects of an industrial sand lance (Ammodytes marinus) fishery off the North Sea coast of the United Kingdom, which has been opened and closed in a quasi-experimental fashion, on sand-lance-dependent breeding seabirds. Controlling for environmental variation ( sea surface temperature, abundance of larval sand lance, and size of adult sand lance), we found that, when the fishery was operating, breeding productivity in the intensively studied seabird colony on the Isle of May was significantly depressed for one surface-feeding seabird species, the Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), but not for four diving species. Analyzing Kittiwake data from 12 colonies inside and outside the closure zone in a replicated before-after control impact design, we again found that breeding productivity was significantly depressed in the closure zone when the fishery was active, whereas no effect was found in the control zone. Furthermore, Kittiwake breeding productivity was negatively correlated with fishery effort during the fishery period in the closure zone, but not in the control zone. The contrasting findings in the two zones could be related to environmental differences or to the fact that only one study colony in the control zone was exposed to high fishery effort within the typical foraging range of Kittiwakes during the breeding season. The strong impact on Kittiwakes, but not on diving species, could result from ( 1) inherently high sensitivity to reduced prey availability, ( 2) changes in the vertical distribution of sand lance at lower densities, ( 3) sand lance showing avoidance behavior to fishery vessels, or a combination of some or all of these factors.

An ESS may be either mixed (genetically fixed differences) or conditional (flexible differences related to varying environmental conditions) (PARKER 1984). Mature males of the marine amphipod Jassa marmorata are dimorphic. Large 'major' males have a greatly enlarged thumb (Propodus) on their 2nd gnathopods, while small 'minor' males exhibit thumbs that are reduced, and CONLAN (1989) suggested that miners may exhibit a different mating strategy from majors. Ratios of males and females fluctuate seasonally (FRANZ 1989) and female body size is inversely correlated with temperature (FRANZ 1989) so male dimorphism could be a flexible response to varying environmental conditions. I sampled a natural population of J. marmorata over a 1-yr period, quantified major and minor morphology, and measured male behaviour and mating success in experimental arenas that contained varying proportions of male morphs and females. Morphology of the two morphs is discrete; female body size varies with season with significantly smaller individuals in summer and fall; body size predicts morph type; and ratios of majors, miners and females fluctuate seasonally. Finally I showed that majors and miners use different mating tactics to gain access to receptive females, and that these behaviours depend on the male's own morphology and on the environmental setting that it finds itself in. Major males fight, display and attempt to evict other males to mate with receptive females. Miners never tight with, display to or attempt to evict majors, but they infrequently display to and attempt to evict other minor males. Furthermore, mating success of the two morphs was not significantly different and may depend on whether males are with a majority or minority of their own type. These data support the conclusion that major and minor male J. marmorata display evolutionarily stable alternative reproductive strategies, but more work should address the nature of this ESS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0179-1613,1439-0310,,,,JUL,1997,103,7,,,,,531,553,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XJ73000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Grid-generated turbulence (Re-lambda less than or equal to 25) in a stable linear mean background density gradient was passed through a two-dimensional contraction, contracting the stream only in the vertical direction. This induces an increase in stratification strength, which reduces the largest vertical overturning scales allowed by buoyancy forces. The mean strain through the contraction causes, on the other hand, stretching of streamwise vortices tending to increase the fluctuation levels of the transverse velocity components. This competition between buoyancy and vortex stretching dominates the turbulence dynamics inside and downstream of the contraction. Comparison between non-stratified and stratified experiments shows that the stratification significantly reduces the vertical velocity fluctuations. The vertical heat flux is initially enhanced through the contraction. Then, farther downstream the flux quickly reverses, leading to very strong restratification coinciding with an increase in the vertical velocity fluctuations. The vertical heat flux collapses much more rapidly than in the stratified case without an upstream contraction and the restratification intensity is also much stronger, showing values of normalized flux as strong as -0.55. Velocity spectra show that the revival of vertical velocity fluctuations, due to the strong restratification, starts at the very largest scales but is then subsequently transferred to smaller scales. The distance from the turbulence-generating grid to the entrance of the contraction is an important parameter which was varied in the experiments. The larger this distance, the larger the integral length scale can grow, approaching the limit set by buoyancy, before entering the contraction. The evolution of the various turbulence length scales is described. Two-point measurements of velocity and temperature transverse integral scales were also performed inside the contraction. The emergence of 'zombie' turbulence, for large buoyancy times, is in good quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations of Gerz & Yamazaki (1993) for stratification number larger than 1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1120,,,,,FEB 25,1995,285,,,,,,371,406,,10.1017/S0022112095000589,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112095000589,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QK09100016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Blue crabs exhibit a distinct population size-structure reflecting seasonal cycles of recruitment and growth in the Rhode River, a subestuary lacking submerged vegetation in central Chesapeake Bay. Seasonally shifting modes in the size-structure, corresponding to juvenile, prepubertal and mature crabs, allowed trawl catches to be partitioned into 0+ and 1+ year classes of the crabs' 2-3 year life span. Fluctuations in the annual abundance of the year classes during 1988-1993 indicated that abundance of 0+ juveniles was not a good predictor of 1+ year-class abundance. We used tethering techniques to assess sources of, and temporal variation in, juvenile blue crab mortality as a function of water depth in the nearshore shallows of the subestuary. Laboratory experiments and analysis of remains of crabs tethered in the field indicated that cannibalism by large blue crabs was the source of 75-97% of mortality of juveniles. Crabs 30-50 mm CW suffered significantly higher mortality than 50-70 mm crabs. Mortality of tethered juveniles was significantly lower in shallow (15 cm) than deep (>70 cm) water. Mortality rates did not differ between day and night periods. Mortality of tethered juvenile blue crabs was high (40-90% per day) and exhibited significant seasonal and annual variation from 1989-1993; and water depth showed significant interaction effects with these components of temporal variability. Multiple regression analysis indicated that water temperature, abundance of 1+ year-class crabs in deep-water trawls, and abundance of 0+ year-class crabs in nearshore seines accounted for 82% of the annual variation in mortality of juveniles tethered at medium (40 cm) depth. Together, these results emphasize the importance of the nearshore shallows and body size as a crucial refuges for juvenile blue crabs encountering intense, but temporally variable cannibalism by large crabs.

Then the tests of shear strength (cohesion and internal friction angle) and the orthogonal experiment are used to analyze the influence of each factor, and then obtained the optimal combination of solidified parameters. The results indicate that the combination of lime, fly ash and MPA can improve the strength of saline soil. After combined treatment, the UCS is 1 130.25 kPa, which is 5.18 times than that of saline soil (218 kPa). The strength of combined solidified saline soil meets the requirements of engineering specification (JTG 3430-2020). The stable value of UCS of combined solidified saline soil under freeze-thaw cycles is 700 kPa. The fluctuation is about 5% after three freeze-thaw cycles. The cohesion and the internal friction angle of combined solidified saline under the most appropriate ratio can be 208.2 kPa and 38.56 degrees, respectively after three freezing-thawing cycles. The sensitivity ranking of the factors is as follows: curing time, lime content, MPA content, dry density, salt content, and times of freeze-thaw cycles. With an increase in lime, fly ash and MPA content, the strength of combined solidified saline soil increases and then tends to become stable. The optimization of solidification parameters can effectively weaken the influence of freeze-thaw on coastal saline soil. Based on tests results of compressive strength and shear strength, it can be concluded that the optimal combination of solidified parameters is 14% of lime, 30% of fly ash, 1% of MPA, 28 days of curing time, and a dry density of 1.65 g/cm(3).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-7598,,,,,FEB 11,2022,43,2,,,,,489,498,,10.16285/j.rsm.2021.0132,http://dx.doi.org/10.16285/j.rsm.2021.0132,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000760193000020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The primitive equations are solved on 12 levels with a horizontal grid-point distance of approximately 20 km. This resolution is sufficient to take into account mesoscale topographic structures which, according to observations and the model results presented here, have a large influence on the distribution of hydrographic variables. However, the model is not eddy-resolving; the baroclinic deformation radius in this region is about 5 km only. At first, a 2-year experiment is run with the forcing functions and the initial stratification derived from climatological annual-mean data. Compared with quasi-synoptic data, the calculated temperature and salinity distributions show a much better adjustment to the topography than does the climatology. The velocities and transports lie within the range of observed long-term mean values. The model fields obtained by this experiment are used to initialize another experiment which is forced with historical 6-hourly wind-stress data of a 2.5-year period. A direct comparison of simulated and observed transport time series shows reasonable agreement. The calculated fluctuations are analyzed using standard statistical methods. The simulated fluctuations and their correlations with the wind data are interpreted with regard to existing simple analytical models. Despite the complex physics retained in the numerical model and the complicated bottom relief and coastlines, many of the analytical results are reproduced. In particular, shelf-wave-like motions on the shelves and trapping of the fluctuations by closed closed-integral/H-contours seem to be important. As a consequence, the predominantly barotropic circulation on the shelves is highly correlated with the wind-stress component parallel to the coast for the frequencies considered. In an intermediate frequency range (approximately 0.2 to 0.01 cpd) the deep along-isobath circulation is coherent with the contour integral of the wind stress along the closed-integral/H-contours enclosing the deep basins. There is some evidence from observations to support these model results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,,,,,JAN,1991,21,1,,,,,118,148,,10.1175/1520-0485(1991)021<0118:ANIOTC>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(1991)021<0118:ANIOTC>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991EY07600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

We measured growth, reproduction and mortality of permanently marked bunchgrasses and measured bunchgrass seedling recruitment and density in permanent quadrats. We burned half of the treatment plots in late spring 1998. Grazing treatments were implemented in 1998, 1999 and 2000 at four different intensities: ungrazed, light rotational grazing (31% average biomass removal), heavy rotational grazing (42% average biomass removal), and continuously grazed. Both burning and grazing affected the bunchgrass population. Bunchgrass mortality was 10% higher in burned vs. unburned plots but was not significantly different among grazing treatments. Seedling density was 100% higher in burned vs. unburned plots 2 years after the burn, however seedling densities never attained pre-burn levels. Seedling densities did not differ significantly among grazing treatments, but grazing reduced the height and reproduction of the mature bunchgrasses. Adult bunchgrass density did not differ significantly in any of the treatments but experienced a five-fold decrease over the 4 years of the experiment. Although the continuous grazing treatment reduced the number of culms produced per plant by 75% from the baseline year, the effect on culm production in the continuous grazing treatment was not consistently greater than the rotational grazing treatments. The interaction of grazing and burning had no significant impacts on the N. pulchra populations except on the diameter of adult bunchgrasses which was highest in the lightly grazed, unburned treatments 2 years following the burn. All response variables except bunchgrass height followed a similar pattern in time over the 4 years of the experiment regardless of treatment, peaking in 1998 and then declining in 1999 and 2000. We believe the above average rainfall and below average temperatures experienced late in the growing season in 1998 provided conditions that favored the native bunchgrasses. Overall, we found few interactive effects of grazing and burning but the separate treatments did affect bunchgrass growth, reproduction and mortality, and these effects were modulated by the ubiquitous effects of climatic fluctuations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1385-0237,,,,,NOV,2005,181,1,,,,,101,112,,10.1007/s11258-005-3797-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-005-3797-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000233382000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Future climate resilient cultivars will need to respond to thermal profiles reflecting more variable conditions, and harness plasticity that involves regulation of epigenetic processes and complex genomic regulatory networks. Compartmentalization within plant cells insulates the genomic central processing unit within the interphase nucleus. This review addresses the properties of the chromatin hardware in which the genome is embedded, focusing on the biophysical and thermodynamic properties of DNA, histones and nucleosomes. It explores the consequences of thermal and ionic variation on the biophysical behavior of epigenetic marks such as DNA cytosine methylation (5mC), and histone variants such as H2A.Z, and how these contribute to maintenance of chromatin integrity in the nucleus, while enabling specific subsets of genes to be regulated. Information is drawn from theoretical molecular in vitro studies as well as model and crop plants and incorporates recent insights into the role epigenetic processes play in mediating between environmental signals and genomic regulation. A preliminary speculative framework is outlined, based on the evidence of what appears to be a cohesive set of interactions at molecular, biophysical and electrostatic level between the various components contributing to chromatin conformation and dynamics. It proposes that within plant nuclei, general and localized ionic homeostasis plays an important role in maintaining chromatin conformation, whilst maintaining complex genomic regulation that involves specific patterns of epigenetic marks. More generally, reversible changes in DNA methylation appear to be consistent with the ability of nuclear chromatin to manage variation in external ionic and temperature environment. Whilst tentative, this framework provides scope to develop experimental approaches to understand in greater detail the internal environment of plant nuclei. It is hoped that this will generate a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying genotype x environment interactions that may be beneficial for long-term improvement of crop performance in less predictable climates.",,,,,"King, Graham J/AAW-3368-2020","King, Graham J/0000-0002-5975-6051",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-462X,,,,,NOV 6,2015,6,,,,,,,,968,10.3389/fpls.2015.00968,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2015.00968,,,,,,,,26594221,,,,,WOS:000364957100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective: The study evaluated the effects of the ratio of pellets of wheat and barley grains to ground corn grain on sorting activity and chewing behaviour of lactating dairy cows managed under ambient conditions including natural heat stress events. Materials and Methods: Nine multiparous cows (650 +/- 56 kg Body Weight; mean +/- SD) averaging 102 +/- 13 days in milk and producing 54 +/- 6 kg/d were randomly assigned to a triplicate 3 x 3 Latin square. During each 21-d period, cows received one of three total mixed rations as dietary treatments. The dietary treatments were three ratio of pellets (containing 50% ground wheat and 50% ground barley): ground corn on a dry matter (DM) basis: 1) 33.3:66.6 (low); 2) 66.6:33.3 (medium); and 3) 100:0 (high). During the experiment, the ambient temperature-humidity index was equal or more than 72, indicating that the cows were predisposed to heat stress condition. Results: Increasing the proportion of wheat-barley pellets in the diet had a minimal effect on sorting index of different particles during the first 6 h of the day. However, later in the day (6-18h), sorting against long particles (particles >19 mm) and in favour of fine particles (particles <1.18 mm) linearly increased with increasing the proportion of pellet; as a result overall daily sorting against long particles was increased with increasing the proportion of pellets. Although the average of daily eating and rumination was not affected by the treatments in the day times with high ambient THI, time spent for eating and rumination was low and eating time had more fluctuation for diet contained a high level of pellets. Conclusion: Increasing the proportion of pellets of barley and wheat grains in the diet under conditions of heat stress caused more fluctuation in daily eating behaviour and cows were predisposed to sort against long particles.",,,,,"Nasrollahi, Sayyed Mahmoud/W-5598-2019","Nasrollahi, Sayyed Mahmoud/0000-0002-5348-1106; kahyani, ali/0000-0001-5453-1083",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2053-1095,,,,JUL,2021,7,4,,,,,1409,1416,,10.1002/vms3.487,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vms3.487,,APR 2021,,,,,,33826250,,,,,WOS:000637446400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experimental studies, and a few epidemiological studies, suggest that air pollution may cause acute exacerbation of psychiatric disorders, and even increase the rate of suicide attempts, but epidemiological studies on air pollution in association with psychiatric disorders are still few. Our aim was to investigate associations between daily fluctuations in air pollution concentrations and the daily number of visits to a psychiatric emergency unit. Methods: Data from Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden, on the daily number of visits to the Psychiatric emergency unit were combined with daily data on monitored concentrations of respirable particulate matter(PM10), ozone(O-3), nitrogen dioxides(NO2) and temperature between 1st July 2012 and 31st December 2016. We used a case-crossover design to analyze data with conditional Poisson regression models allowing for over-dispersion. We stratified data on season. Results: Visits increased with increasing PM10 levels during the warmer season (April to September) in both single-pollutant and two-pollutant models. For example, an increase of 3.6% (95% Confidence Interval, CI, 0.4-7.0%) was observed with a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM10 adjusted for NO2. In the three-pollutant models (adjusting for NO2 and O-3 simultaneously) the increase was 3.3% (95% CI, -0.2-6.9). There were no clear associations between the outcome and NO2, O-3, or PM10 during the colder season (October to March). Conclusions: Ambient air particle concentrations were associated with the number of visits to the Psychiatric emergency unit in the warm season. The results were only borderline statistically significant in the fully adjusted (three-pollutant) models in this small study. The observation could be interpreted as indicative of air pollution as either exacerbating an underlying psychiatric disorder, or increasing mental distress, even in areas with comparatively low levels of air pollution. In combination with the severe impact of psychiatric disorders and mental distress on society and individuals, our results are a strong warrant for future research in this area.",,,,,"Steingrimsson, Steinn/AAL-2079-2020; Carlsen, Hanne Krage/AAI-4463-2020; Steingrimsson, Steinn/AAF-5475-2021","Carlsen, Hanne Krage/0000-0003-1656-9624; Steingrimsson, Steinn/0000-0001-8320-5607",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-069X,,,,JAN 10,2018,17,,,,,,,,4,10.1186/s12940-017-0348-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12940-017-0348-8,,,,,,,,29321054,,,,,WOS:000419965500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, fine-tuning of flowering phenology, i.e., responses to yearly fluctuations in the local environment, should best be accomplished via phenotypic plasticity. To test theoretical expectations as to the interaction of genetic differentiation and plasticity, and conditions under which each should be most important, populations of the inbreeding Sporobolus cryptandrus and the outbreeding Panicum virgatum were compared in genetic variation among clones and in amounts and patterns of plasticity in phenology. For each species, three years of data from replicated blocks of cloned genotypes in a common garden near Fort Collins, Colorado, were treated as characters measured in three environments as a way of quantifying ''environmental sensitivity and partitioning the variance in flowering time. The three years provided major differences in length of growing season, temperatures. precipitation, and evaporation rates. The outbreeding species possessed the greatest genetic variation among clones in a population, while the inbreeding species showed less genetic variation within and more between populations. Populations of both species varied significantly in amount and highly significantly in pattern of plasticity. The long-lived, clonal Panicum showed a significantly greater plasticity than the short-lived, non-clonal Sporobolus. The plasticity variance component was the largest component overall for Sporobolus. which is found over the widest range of environments heterogeneous in space and time, and there was a highly significant relation between a population's ecological history and the relative importance of plasticity in flowering phenology.

With the aim to examine the accumulated effect of variation in flood-levels on colonization and survival of sessile intertidal invertebrates on artificial substrates in a fringe mangrove forest, a field experiment was conducted from November-2000 to September-2001. A total of 72 PVC-stakes 2 m long were encased with cement to resemble rhizophores (prop roots) of Rhizophora mangle. They were then embedded in mud at four sampling stations (18 per station: 9 in a shaded site and 9 in a sunny site), and groups of 6 were collected from each sampling station (3 from each shaded site and 3 from each sunny site) without replacement at the end of each climatic period (Eastern winds, dry and rainy).

Temporal, spatial and vertical distribution of Species richness (S) and abundance of living and dead individuals were registered, and the data was analyzed by ANOVA. Only seven species colonized the substrates, the majority of them were recorded throughout the year and in all sampling stations. There was no seasonal succession of species. At the end of the experiment, only 20 % of the epibionts had survived. The polychaete Ficopomatus miamiensis was the most abundant, but had significantly lower survival than the other species (0-14 %). Epibionts preferred to settle in shaded sites rather than sunny ones regardless of the sampling station and the climatic season. In conclusion, artificial substrate colonization was successful but the majority of epibionts died because of long exposure and desiccation after the inlet was opened by local fishermen.

Increasing dietary DLys levels increased linearly DLys intake (mg/bird/day) and expenditure (mg/g of produced egg) without affecting laying performance and egg mass and quality. Quails fed with dietary 2875 or 3150 kcal/kg adjusted voluntary feed intake to maintain similar ME intake and, as a consequence, had similar percentage of posture, egg mass, viable eggs for sale, egg weight, and economic return.

Model experiments run with the Pothole Complex Hydrologic Model using downscaled climate data (variables relating to precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration at 1/8 degrees spatial resolution under four general circulation climate models and two gas emissions scenarios) were used to forecast the abundances of six focal wetland-dependent bird species in the Missouri Coteau portion of the PPR, providing ensemble scenarios at a spatial scale relevant to resource management. Although the projected number of May ponds (waterbodies present during bird breeding season) fluctuated through time with some decadal periodicity (and with the number present in a given year reflecting abundance over the previous three years), the ensemble model average indicated an increase in the average number of waterbodies present by the turn of the next century. Overall, the model experiments conservatively projected an 11.75% increase in the number of waterbodies present by 2090-2099 compared to a baseline period from 1967 to 2005 in the PPR. Wetland-dependent bird occurrence and abundance were significantly associated with temporal patterns and decadal periodicity in waterbody dynamics. Because of the strong associations between wetland-dependent bird occurrence and abundance and the number of prairie potholes, projected waterbody increases are forecasted to result in an 11.97% overall increase in occurrence and 8.63% increase in abundance of the six focal species by the end of the 21st century; these results contrast with forecasted drought-associated declines in waterbodies and birds in the PPR.

The Georgian Bay, Ontario population of the eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus) is designated as Threatened, in part because of high road mortality. In Killbear Provincial Park, four ecopassages and barrier fencing were constructed along three busy park roads to reduce road mortality of massasaugas. Aim Although mitigation of road mortality has been widely recommended and in some instances implemented for reptiles, effectiveness of mitigation efforts is often inadequately evaluated. The goals of our study were to use long-term data to quantify the effectiveness of ecopassages and barrier fencing in reducing massasauga fatalities on roads, and to evaluate the potential of these structures to serve as movement corridors for individual snakes. Methods We used five approaches to assess the overall efficacy of mitigation efforts: (1) comparison of pre- and post-mitigation road mortality; (2) camera traps in ecopassages to document massasauga and predator presence; (3) automated tag readers in ecopassage entrances to detect PIT-tagged individuals; (4) an experiment to assess massasauga willingness to enter and travel through ecopassages; and (5) measurement of temperature fluctuations in ecopassages to assess thermal suitability for massasaugas. Key results We found a significant decrease in road mortality of massasaugas on stretches of park roads associated with ecopassages and barrier fencing post construction. Automated tag readers and cameras detected the presence of massasaugas and other animals within the ecopassages, and experimental data showed that massasaugas willingly entered, and in some cases crossed through, ecopassages. Conclusion Our evaluation of mitigation structures determined that they successfully reduce road mortality and provide potential movement corridors between bisected habitats, provided that intense maintenance of the fencing is conducted yearly. We also demonstrated the need to utilise a combination of multiple post-monitoring methods to effectively evaluate mitigation structures.

During the simulation the system tended to perform small fluctuations around a structure similar to, but somewhat looser than the starting crystal structure. The calmodulin-peptide complex was quite rigid and did not exhibit any large amplitude domain motions such as previously seen in apo- and calcium-bound calmodulin. We analyzed the calmodulin-peptide interactions by calculating buried surface areas, CHARMM interaction energies and continuum model interaction free energies. In the trajectory, the protein surface area buried by contact with the peptide is 1373 Angstrom(2), approximately evenly divided between the calmodulin N-terminal, C-terminal and central linker regions. A majority of this buried surface, 803 Angstrom(2), comes from nonpolar residues, in contrast to the protein as a whole, for which the surface is made up of mostly polar and charged groups. Our continuum calculations indicate that the largest favorable contribution to peptide binding comes from burial of molecular surface upon complex formation. Electrostatic contributions are favorable but smaller in the trajectory structures, and actually unfavorable for binding in the crystal structure. Since nonpolar groups make up most of buried surface of the protein, our calculations suggest that the hydrophobic effect is the main driving force for binding the helical peptide to calmodulin, consistent with thermodynamic analysis of experimental data. Besides the burial of nonpolar surface area, secondary contributions to peptide binding come from burial of polar surface and electrostatic interactions. In the nonpolar interactions a crucial role is played by the nine methionines of calmodulin.

We conducted experiments to determine whether checkered pufferfish (Sphoeroides testudineus), which were collected from a dynamic (in terms of depth and water temperature) tidal mangrove creek environment in The Bahamas, have consistent individual-level differences in locomotor activity and the response to a simulated predator threat, as well as swimming performance and puffing in response to stressors. The relationships between personality and performance traits were evaluated to determine whether they represented stress-coping styles or syndromes. Subsequently, a displacement study was conducted to determine how personality and performance in the laboratory compared to movements in the field. In addition, we tested whether a physiological dose of the stress hormone cortisol would alter individual consistency in behavioural and performance traits. We found that pufferfish exhibited consistent individual differences in personality traits over time (e.g., activity and the duration of a response to a threat) and that performance was consistent between the lab and the natural enclosure. Locomotor activity and the duration of startled behaviour were not associated with swimming and puffing performance. Locomotor activity, puffing performance, and swimming performance were not related to whether fish returned to the tidal creek of capture after displacement. Similarly, a cortisol treatment did not modify behaviour or performance in the laboratory. The results reveal that consistent individual-level differences in behaviour and performance were present in a population from a fluctuating and physiologically challenging environment but that such traits are not necessarily correlated. We also determined that certain individual performance traits were repeatable between the lab and a natural enclosure. However, we found no evidence of a relationship between exogenous cortisol levels and behavioural traits or performance in these fish, which suggests that other internal and external mechanisms may underlie the behaviours and performance tested.

Two models for liquid-like slender bodies, the general prolate-spheroid model (PSM) and the deformed-cylinder model (DCM), were used to compute the TS of the fish relative to its orientation. The relative mass density g and the sound speed h in sea-water were measured and used in both models. To confirm the appropriateness of the models, tethered experimental measurements were carried out at 38 kHz for five specimens. The value of g measured by the density-bottle method was very low (1.002-1.009) compared with that of marine fish in general. The value of h measured by the time-average approach was 1.032-1.039 at the water temperature at which S. leucopsarus is found. TS-fluctuation patterns against fish orientation (the TS pattern) estimated from the DCM and PSM were in good agreement in the area of their main lobes. Both models reproduced the main lobes of the measured TS patterns in near-horizontal orientation (<+/- 20 degrees), and they were considered to be effective in measuring the TS of S. leucopsarus in a horizontal (swimming) position. After these comparative experiments, we computed the TS of 57 fish (27.8-106.9 mm) at 38, 70,120, and 200 kHz, using the DCM. A plot of body length (in log scale) against TS showed a non-linear relationship at all frequencies. S. leucopsarus had a very low TS (<-85 dB, TScm), suggesting that acoustic assessment would be highly sensitive, especially when the proportion of small fish is high (e.g. L/lambda < 2), and an appropriate frequency should be considered that takes into account both the length composition and the depth of occurrence.

The fresh-market cultivar and that of the cherry type were grown in greenhouses using a drip irrigation system. The processing cultivar was grown under a floating cover with furrow irrigation. The irrigation treatments for both years were based on crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and their values were 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 ETc for the first year, and 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 ETc for the second year for the cultivars tested in greenhouses with the drip irrigation system. The cultivar grown outdoors received furrow irrigation with the values 0.5 and 1.0 ETc for the first year and 0.4 and 0.8 ETc for the second year. Soil water was measured with tensiometers during the entire treatment period. Higher rates of irrigation increased yields in two of the three cultivars. Longitudinal cracking was the type most frequently observed in these experiments. In both years of the furrow irrigation experiments, the incidence of cracking was high when large fluctuations of the soil matric potential were induced after having maintained high negative values of this parameter during several previous days. In the experiments using drip irrigation, cracking was limited, but increased when high fluctuations in the soil matric potential were induced after having maintained high negative values of matric potential for several previous days, as was the case with furrow irrigation.

Both fresh thalli and culture filtrate of U. pertusa and G. lemaneiformis, particularly in the form of fresh thalli, significantly inhibited microalgal growth; indeed, the microalga was completely killed during the course of the experiment. A clear concentration-dependent relationship was observed between the initial concentration of fresh thalli (either U. pertusa or G. lemaneiformis) and its inhibitory effect on H. akashiwo. Simultaneous nutrient assays showed that nitrate and phosphate were almost exhausted in G. lemaneiformis fresh thalli co-culture but remained well above nutrient limitation for microalgal growth in U. pertusa co-culture, in which the microalgal cells were completely killed. However, daily f/2 medium repletion would obviously alleviate the growth inhibition in G. lemaneiformis co-culture. Since the present study was carried out under controlled conditions, fluctuations in environmental factors (i.e., light, temperature, carbon limitation, bacterial presence and pH) were limited during the experiment. We thus concluded that allelopathy was the most likely explanation for microalgal growth inhibition in U. pertusa co-culture, while the combined roles of allelopathy and nutrient limitation were responsible for growth inhibition in G. lemaneiformis co-culture. Similarly, macroalgal water-soluble extracts and dry powders affected the co-cultured H. akashiwo greatly, with more obvious effects observed in water-soluble extract co-cultures. A dose-dependent relationship was also observed over the course of the experiment. It can be concluded that macroalgal thalli contain some bioactive compounds. The results of the present study suggest that U. pertusa and G. lemaneiformis, especially in the form of fresh thalli, effectively inhibit the growth of H. akashiwo and could thus be potential candidates for use in the control and mitigation of H. akashiwo blooms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0921-8971,1573-5176,,,,AUG,2009,21,4,,,,,375,385,,10.1007/s10811-008-9380-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-008-9380-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000267682100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gas from sediments of Vallisneria beds had the highest methane concentrations (about 60-90% v/v); methane concentrations in gas from sediments of Myriophyllum beds were the lowest (falling to 17 +/- 3% v/v in May 1994), and concentrations in sediments of Eleocharis beds varied from about 25% v/v in winter to about 60-82% v/v in summer-autumn. Total water-atmosphere methane fluxes, measured with 0.8 m(3) static chambers, varied from <0.01 to 2.75 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in Eleocharis beds, <0.01 to 0.95 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in Myriophyllum beds, and <0.01 to 1.64 mmol m(-2) h(-1) in areas of open water colonised by Vallisneria. Total fluxes were highly seasonal, being greatest in summer-autumn, when sediment temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C. Strong diurnal and diel variations were also observed, especially in Eleocharis beds during the warmer months. Ebullition rates varied from <0.05 to 1.61 mmol m(-2) h(-1) and, like total water-atmosphere fluxes, fluctuated according to season, being lowest in winter and highest in summer-autumn. Ebullition seemingly accounted for 6-15% of total methane fluxes from Eleocharis beds in the cooler months, and 30-90% in the warmer months. Eleocharis shoots could generate pressures of up to 550 Pa during summer days, and the seasonal pattern to plant pressurization matched closely the seasonality of total methane emissions from Eleocharis beds.

We analyze the statistics of density fluctuations generated in this process, using direct numerical simulations. We then check the relevance of these results for in situ density profiles measured during the ARCANE experiment on the continental slope west of the Iberian peninsula, a region with strong internal tides. We focus the analysis in the depth range [400-1000 m] for which the temperature is uniform, and the density stratification is due mainly to salinity. We verify in the numerical simulations that the histograms of vertical density gradients become strongly skewed at small vertical scales. This intermittency of density fluctuations can be attributed to the formation of sheets with strong stable density gradients. These sheets result from convergent motion produced by surrounding breaking events. We check that the vertical density gradients at finescale can be represented by a model of layers and sheets distributed with a Poisson statistics, with a mean number of sheets per unit length, mu. We next show that the mean sheet spacing mu(-1) is proportional to the Ozmidov scale (proportional to the square root of the energy dissipation). Using the classical link between energy dissipation and vertical eddy diffusivity K-d, we deduce a link between the statistics of vertical density gradients and the vertical mixing, namely K-d is proportional to Nmu(-2). For in situ measurements, we find a similar statistics of vertical density gradients, confirming earlier results obtained by Hayes et al. [J. Geophys. Res. 80 (3) 314] and Pinkel and Anderson [J. Phys. Oceanogr. 22 (1992) 773] in the open ocean thermocline. This allows us to estimate a rate of total energy dissipation 2.4 x 10(-8) W/kg and a vertical eddy diffusivity 5 x 10(-4) M-2 S-1. Comparisons with other estimates of energy dissipation or vertical mixing would be required to validate this method. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In selected areas of all fields, the R. solanacearum population densities were initially on the order 10(4) to 10(6) per g of topsoil. These population densities then declined progressively over time. In two fields, however, the pathogen persisted for periods of 10 to 12 months. The survival of a selected R. solanancearum biovar 2 isolate, strain 1609, in three soils, a loamy sand and two different silt loam soils, was further studied in soil microcosm experiments. The effects of temperature and soil moisture content were assessed. At 12 or 15 and 20 degreesC, a gradual decline of the population densities was observed in all three soils, from the established 10(5) to 10(6) CFU g(-1) of dry soil to significantly reduced levels, occasionally bordering the limit of detection (10(2) CFU g(-1) of dry soil), in periods of approximately 90 to 210 days. Soil type affected the rate of population decline at 20 degreesC, with the greatest decline occurring in loamy sand soil. In all three soils, the survival of IFC-detectable R. solanacearum 1609 cells at 4 degreesC was severely impaired, reflected in an accelerated decline of CFU counts, to undetectable numbers. Moreover, indications were found for the occurrence of viable but nonculturable strain 1609 cells in the loamy sand as well as in one silt loam soil under these conditions. In addition, a single freezing-thawing cycle caused a significant additional reduction of the culturable R. solanacearum 1609 populations in the three soils, though detectable populations remained. Moderate soil moisture fluctuations of approximately pF 2 did not affect the survival of R. solanacearumm 1609 in soil.

This approach neglects the spatio-temporal dimension of the light reduction experienced by the crop in agroforestry systems. In this study, we evaluate the ability of the crop model STICS to predict winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth and yield under three distinct light conditions using field observations from a two year artificial shade experiment. The shade structure induced a continuous shade (CS) treatment characterized by a reduction of the proportion of light during the entire day and a periodic shade (PS) treatment defined by an intermittent shade varying on the plot throughout the day. These two shade conditions were compared to a no shade treatment (NS) receiving 100% of the available light. The model accurately predicted the timing of the grain maturity stage under the PS treatment by reducing the daily global radiation only. A correct prediction of this growth stage in the CS treatment required a decrease of the daily maximum air temperature in addition to the reduction of global radiation. Overall, the model accurately reproduces the total aboveground dry matter dynamics under the CS and NS treatments, but did not simulate the reduction observed under the PS treatment correctly. Three parameters (nbjgrain, cgraln and cgrainvo) involved in the determination of the number of grains have been calibrated with the NS treatment data and were then used to predict the crop behavior under the shaded treatments. Using this adjusted parameter set, the STICS model gave a good prediction of the grain number under all treatments. Nevertheless, the simulation of final grain yield under the shade treatments was not satisfactory yet, presumably due to an overestimation of the reallocation of the biomass between shoots and grains. Improving the prediction of these reallocation processes is challenging and critical to improve the simulation of crop behavior under fluctuating light environments such as encountered in agroforestry systems.",,,,,"Garré, Sarah/H-3655-2019","Garré, Sarah/0000-0001-9025-5282; Launay, Marie/0000-0003-4067-3907; Dumont, Benjamin/0000-0001-8411-3990",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-4290,1872-6852,,,,JAN,2018,215,,,,,,83,93,,10.1016/j.fcr.2017.10.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.10.005,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000417657300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in semiarid regions the impact of crops on the soil bacterial community appears to be modulated or affected by edaphic properties such as soil moisture availability. Therefore the objective of this study was to determine the relative influence of crops (wheat, lentil, field pea, canola, and a fallow treatment), soil chemistry, and edaphic properties on the diversity and composition of soil bacterial communities in a semiarid agroecosystem. We used a temporal sampling strategy and high throughput sequencing approach to monitor changes in the soil bacterial community in relation to crop host identity and phenology and soil properties. Structuring of the bacterial community across the 20 experimental plots was driven primarily by soil pH which varied strongly (min: 5.25, max: 6.97) across the site. Weak temporal shifts in the bacterial community were observed across the growing season and were related to seasonal variation in soil moisture (min: 8.3%, max: 20.3%), soil temperature (min. daily mean: 3.3 degrees C, max. daily mean: 21.1 degrees C), and fluctuation in available phosphate in the soil (min: 0.003 mg cm(-2) day(-1), max: 0.290 mg cm(-2) day(-1)). These temporal and spatial shifts were not influenced by crop host identity as similar bacterial communities were observed among the crops and fallow treatment. Variance partitioning revealed that soil pH and soil moisture accounted for a high proportion of the variation of the soil bacterial community, while crops had no significant impact in the study. Edaphic factors appeared to override or level the effect of crops on the soil bacterial community. These results highlight the importance of accounting for edaphic properties for managing soil bacterial communities in agroecosystems. Crown Copyright (c) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the noise level of various GRACE-derived TWS anomalies (TWSA) data were evaluated by using a generalized three-cornered hat (GTCH) method A time-dependent weights approach was adopted to obtain a combined TWSA series over the Songhua River Basin (SRB) from 2003 to 2013. Monthly TWSA data during the past decades (1982-2002) were reconstructed by using an artificial neural network (ANN) approach with the good performance evaluated by the correlation coefficient of 0.89 and the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency of 0.79 over the study region. In-situ groundwater level measurements were used for validation of the groundwater storage (GWS) changes (estimated by using GRACE-derived TWS changes in association with the other simulated components of water storage changes from land surface models (LSMs)). The primary driving factors of spatiotemporal variations of GWS, as well as their inter-/infra-annually varying characteristics, were explored:Me present study revealed that the variations of GWS featured a downward fluctuations (1982-1994), stable upward (1998-2008) and decreasing dramatically (2009-2013) period, respectively, over the SRB. In general, GWS had varied in a steady decline trend at a decreasing rate of 1.04 +/- 0.59 men year(-1) from 1982 to 1994. With the enhanced climatic and anthropogenic influences over the region since 2000, several severe fluctuations characterized the GWS variations with occurrences of spring droughts and flooding over the region, which suggested significant effects of global changes posed on GWS variations of the region.

Local adaptation of populations maintains intraspecific genetic variation in various shoot traits, but the contribution of genetic factors to adaptation to soil heterogeneity remains poorly known. I established a common-garden experiment with three Norway spruce Picea abies populations sampled between 60 degrees and 67 degrees N in Finland, each represented by 13 or 15 maternal families, to determine whether belowground traits are as genetically differentiated among populations as those in the shoot along a collective latitudinal gradient of temperature and soil heterogeneity. Two growing season simulations enabled testing for among-population differences in phenotypic plasticity. I phenotyped 777 first-year seedlings from shoot to root to capture functional traits that may influence survival in the wild: autumn phenology, shoot growth, root system size, root architecture, root morphology and growth allocation. All traits exhibited within-population genetic diversity, but among-population differentiation ranged from strong in shoot traits to nonexistent in root system architecture and morphology that are scaled to root system size. However, latitudinal trends characterised root-to-shoot ratio and root tip-to-shoot ratio that account for among-population differences in aboveground growth. Overall trait variability was multidimensional with variable among- versus within-population trends: for example, phenology and shoot growth covaried across populations, but their association within individual populations was variable. Shoot growth correlated positively with root system size, but not with root architecture or morphology. Finally, the two higher-latitude populations exhibited greater phenotypic plasticity in shoot traits and growth allocation.

In both experiments, soil Cu contents significantly affected Cu-W. Soil moisture only significantly affected Cu accumulation for the wettest soil, Under laboratory conditions, a steady state did not seem to be achieved after 56 days; the Cu accumulation can be described by the toxicokinetic one-compartment model, The field experiment was considerably affected by variation in soil temperature resulting in significant fluctuations in tissue Cu concentrations, The tissue Cu accumulation was significantly correlated to the Cu-T, which is in agreement with the results from the laboratory experiments, Variance of Cu-W at Day 14 in earthworms from the field experiments was significantly larger than in the worms from the laboratory experiment, At Day 28, the differences were not significant.

In a landmark study examining the role of endocarps in regulating germination, our aim was to investigate the effects of the natural sequence of environmental conditions on dormancy break of a species with a woody endocarp (Persoonia longifolia). Methods The role of the endocarp in germination was investigated through imbibition and endocarp removal germination tests. The use of burial to break dormancy was examined and results from these experiments were used to guide laboratory investigations into the use of wet/dry cycling and stratification to break dormancy. Key Results Endocarps were water-permeable. Germination increased from 0 to 92 center dot 5 % when endocarps were removed. During burial in the field and nursery, 41 center dot 6 and 63 center dot 7 % of the endocarps germinated, respectively, after 36 months. Ex situ post-burial germination was cyclical and highest after 30 months of burial (45 center dot 4 % nursery and 31 center dot 8 % field). Highest germination occurred in wet/dry trials when the dry summer was long (20 weeks), had fluctuating temperatures (30/50 A degrees C) and two long (7 d) wet cycles and was followed by moist winters at 10/20 A degrees C. A stratification trial found that highest germination occurred following incubation for 12 weeks at 30 A degrees C (including 2 weeks moist) + 6 weeks moist at 8 A degrees C then placement at 20/10 A degrees C for germination. Conclusions Summer conditions break physiological dormancy of the embryo and promote opening of the endocarp, allowing seeds to germinate during winter conditions. By closely monitoring the environment that endocarps are exposed to in nature, dormancy breaking mechanisms can be identified and used to improve germination. These results outline for the first time how dormancy and germination are regulated in a species with a hard woody endocarp, insights which will significantly improve our understanding of other species with similar reproductive features.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,AUG,2016,118,2,,,,,331,346,,10.1093/aob/mcw100,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcw100,,,,,,,,27296132,,,,,WOS:000383179200018,View Full Record in Web of Science

There were no significant differences in the mean pre-oviposition period, duration of oviposition and the number of eggs laid by R. sanguineus and H. leachi leachi in all the photoperiodic conditions. The pre-oviposition periods of R. sanguineus and H. leachi leachi sampled every six hours (disturbed group) were significantly lower (p<0.05) than those sampled every 24 hours (undisturbed group).

Effects of biotic environment on hatching,JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The beginning and end of diapause are two important transition points in cladoceran life history. The influence of environmental variables on the dynamics of these processes still deserves attention, especially as concerns the role of biotic factors. In this paper we focus on emergence from diapause, testing (1) whether ephippia of Daphnia obtusa Kurz can assess the presence in the water of typical planktivorous fish or ostracods, and (2) whether such an assessment results in changes in hatching strategy. Total number of hatchlings from D. obtusa ephippial eggs did not differ between the control and the treatments in which the presence of fish or ostracods could be detected (ANOVA, P = 0.884). However, hatching dynamics were different: most of the eggs hatched synchronously at day 4 (83.3% of the total hatchlings number) in the control, while only a low proportion of eggs hatched on day 4 in the fish (38.3%), and ostracod treatments (24.0% of the total). Mean hatching time was longer, and variability larger, in the treatments than in the control; differences resulted statistically significant (ANOVA, P = 0.005). With respect to the control, representing a simple microcosm controlled by abiotic variables only, the treatments may be regarded as relatively complex environments, in which Daphnia is also exposed to biotic cues. Under these more complex conditions, the same number of hatchlings is obtained through different hatching dynamics. In the treatments, the first hatchlings appeared later and the hatching rate was more variable than in the control. These observations confirm previously observed patterns from laboratory experiments which tested the effect of competition and fluctuating environmental conditions (light.-dark, temperature regimes) on D, obtusa reproductive and demographic parameters. They are also in agreement with recently obtained evidence concerning the importance of biotic cues for hatching of ephippial eggs. Overall, the evidence suggests that Daphnia can defect infochemicals during dormancy. Specifically, we propose that the presence in the water medium of potential predators and competitors results in a short-term hatching asynchrony of ephippial eggs.",,,,,"Bozelli, Reinaldo L/G-1805-2012; Bozelli, Reinaldo/S-6414-2019","Bozelli, Reinaldo L/0000-0001-9916-1629; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1129-5767,1723-8633,,,,,2008,67,2,,,,,100,106,,10.4081/jlimnol.2008.100,http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2008.100,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000261475800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the C and N cycles in soil are usually considered to be closely linked, few data exist where both C and N pools and gross N fluxes have been measured seasonally. Here we present measurements of inorganic N, extracted soluble organic N, microbial biomass C and N, gross N fluxes and CO2 production from soil collected under wheat in a ley-arable and continuous arable rotation within a long-term experiment. The amounts of inorganic N and extracted soluble organic N were similar (range 5-35 kg N ha(-1); 0-23 cm) but had different seasonal patterns: whilst inorganic N declined during wheat growth, extracted soluble organic N peaked after cultivation and also during maximal stem elongation. The microbial biomass was significantly larger in the ley-arable (964 kg C ha(-1); 0-23 cm) than the continuous arable rotation (518 kg C ha(-1); 0-23 cm) but with no clear seasonal pattern. In contrast, CO2 produced from soil and gross N mineralization showed strong seasonality linked to soil temperature and moisture content. Normalization of soil CO2 production and gross N mineralization with respect to these environmental regulators enabled us to study the underlying influence of the incorporation of fresh plant material into soil on these processes. The average normalized gross rates of N mineralized during the growing season were 1.74 and 2.55 kg N ha(-1) nday(-1) in continuous arable and ley-arable rotations respectively. Production rates (gross N mineralization, gross nitrification) were similar in both land uses and matched rates of NH4+ and NO3- consumption, resulting in periods of net N mineralization and immobilization. There was no simple relationship between soil CO2 production and gross N mineralization, which we attributed to changes in the C : N ratio of the mineralizing pool(s).",,,,,"Stockdale, Elizabeth/A-8141-2013; Goulding, Keith WT/B-2635-2012","Goulding, Keith WT/0000-0002-6465-1465; Murphy, Daniel/0000-0002-4686-9276; Stockdale, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4834-8594",,,,,,,,,,,,,1351-0754,,,,,DEC,2007,58,6,,,,,1410,1424,,10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00946.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00946.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000251026300019,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is well known that during the solar seasons, SIMCOs play an important role in the polar carbon-cycle, by increasing the total photosynthetic primary production of the South Ocean and participating in the remineralization of phosphates and nitrogen. What remains poorly understood is the dynamic of SIMCO populations and their ecological contribution to carbon and nutrient cycling throughout the entire annual life of Antarctic sea-ice, especially in winter. Sea ice at this time of the year is an extreme environment, characterized by complete darkness (which stops photosynthesis), extremely low temperatures in its upper horizons (down to -45 degrees C) and high salinity (up to 150-250 psu) in its brine inclusions, where SIMCOs thrive. Without a permanent station, wintering expeditions in Antarctica are technically difficult; therefore, in this study, the process of autumn freezing was modelled under laboratory conditions, and the resulting 'young ice' was further incubated in cold and darkness for one month. The ice formation experiment was primarily designed to reproduce two critical conditions: (i) total darkness, causing the photosynthesis to cease, and (ii) the presence of a large amount of algae-derived organic matter. As expected, in the absence of photosynthesis, the activity of aerobic heterotrophs quickly created micro-oxic conditions, which caused the emergence of new players, namely facultative anaerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Following this finding, we can state that Antarctic pack-ice and its surrounding ambient (under-ice seawater and platelet ice) are likely to be very dynamic and can quickly respond to environmental changes caused by the seasonal fluctuations. Given the size of Antarctic pack-ice, even in complete darkness and cessation of photosynthesis, its ecosystem appears to remain active, continuing to participate in global carbon-and-sulfur cycling under harsh conditions.",,,,,"; Crisafi, Francesca/P-3660-2018; La Cono, Violetta/S-9890-2017; Yakimov, Michail/H-1829-2016","Toshchakov, Stepan/0000-0001-7549-3450; Crisafi, Francesca/0000-0002-4917-893X; La Cono, Violetta/0000-0002-3306-4938; Yakimov, Michail/0000-0003-1418-363X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-2607,,,,MAR,2022,10,3,,,,,,,623,10.3390/microorganisms10030623,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10030623,,,,,,,,35336197,,,,,WOS:000774091500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to characterise this cold-water (C) factory a 2-year experiment was carried out in the southern Faial Channel to study the biodiversity of hardground communities and for budgeting carbonate production and degradation along a bathymetrical transect from the intertidal to bathyal 500 m depth. Seasonal temperatures peak in September (above a thermocline) and bottom in March (stratification diminishes) with a decrease in amplitude and absolute values with depth, and tidal-driven short-term fluctuations. Measured seawater stable isotope ratios and levels of dissolved nutrients decrease with depth, as do the calcium carbonate saturation states. The photosynthetic active radiation shows a base of the euphotic zone in similar to 70 m and a dysphotic limit in similar to 150 m depth. Bioerosion, being primarily a function of light availability for phototrophic endoliths and grazers feeding upon them, is similar to 10 times stronger on the illuminated upside versus the shaded underside of substrates in the photic zone, with maximum rates in the intertidal (-631 g/m(2)/yr). Rates rapidly decline towards deeper waters where bioerosion and carbonate accretion are slow and epibenthic/endolithic communities take years to mature. Accretion rates are highest in the lower euphotic zone (955 g/m(2)/yr), where the substrate is less prone to hydrodynamic force. Highest rates are found - inversely to bioerosion - on down-facing substrates, suggesting that bioerosion may be a key factor governing the preferential settlement and growth of calcareous epilithobionts on down-facing substrates. In context of a latitudinal gradient, the Azores carbonate cycling rates plot between known values from the cold-temperate Swedish Kosterfjord and the tropical Bahamas, with a total range of two orders in magnitude.

Climate change will cause changes in average temperature and precipitation as well as increased fluctuations around the mean, yet few studies have considered the impacts of altered climate variability on plant populations. We tested whether life-history traits (expected life span, generation time and seed size) can predict plant responses to increased environmental variability across similar plant species sharing the same habitat. 2. We combined long-term demographic data on 10 prairie forb species with stochastic demography techniques to estimate the effects of potential changes in matrix element means and variances on the long-term stochastic population growth rate. 3. For all 10 species, recruitment had higher contribution and elasticity values than survival, meaning that climate change is more likely to influence population growth through effects on recruitment than on survival for these relatively short-lived forbs. Species with longer generation times had lower elasticities to increases in matrix element variability. 4. Synthesis. Our analysis of a unique, long-term data set suggests that longer-lived plant species will be less vulnerable to the effects of future increases in climate variability. While this relationship was previously reported for diverse taxa from many locations, our results show that it also applies within a guild of short-lived species from a single community.

We studied the movements of bull trout by using radio telemetry in a hydropeaking reach of the upper Columbia River, near Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada. Fifty-seven bull trout were located every 12 h to evaluate the effects of discharge magnitude and rate of change on the: (1) odds of movement; (2) movement distances; and (3) movement direction. Twelve-hour mean discharge magnitude had a negative effect on the odds of bull movement: for every 100 m(3) s(-1) increase in discharge, movement odds decreased by a factor of 0.91. Movement odds were unrelated to 12-h discharge rate of change. Every 1 degrees C increase in water temperature increased movement odds by a factor of 1.27. Also, bull trout were more likely to move during the AM versus PM by a factor of 1.36. Movement distances were related to diel period, sex and fork length; however, these effects were not very strong. We found no evidence of downstream displacement during periods of high or changing river discharge. In fact, movement direction was unpredictable, which is consistent with the salmonid non-migratory movement literature. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the biology of bull trout during an understudied seasonal life-history period (i.e. autumn). It also informs river managers that bull trout movement can be modulated by operational water release from a dam.

J,,,,,,,EFSA,CONCLUSION ON PESTICIDE PEER REVIEW Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance metam Issued on 26 November 2008,EFSA JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"Metam is one of the 84 substances of the third stage Part B of the review programme covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/20021. This Regulation requires the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to organise upon request of the EU-Commission a peer review of the initial evaluation, i.e. the draft assessment report (DAR), provided by the designated rapporteur Member State and to provide within six months a conclusion on the risk assessment to the EU-Commission. Belgium being the designated rapporteur Member State submitted the DAR on metam in accordance with the provisions of Article 10(1) of the Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, which was received by the EFSA on 10 September 2007. The peer review was initiated on 4 October 2007 by dispatching the DAR for consultation of the Member States and the main notifier Taminco. Subsequently, the comments received on the DAR were examined and responded by the rapporteur Member State in the reporting table. This table was evaluated by the EFSA to identify the remaining issues. The identified issues as well as further information made available by the notifier upon request were evaluated in a series of scientific meetings with Member State experts in June - July 2008. A final discussion of the outcome of the consultation of experts took place during a written procedure with the Member States in October 2008 leading to the conclusions as laid down in this report. This conclusion was reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative uses as a nematicide, fungicide, herbicide and insecticide by soil fumigation prior to the planting of carrot, lamb's lettuce, cucumber, aubergine, pepper, potato, strawberry, tomato and grapes. Full details of the GAP can be found in the attached list of end points. The representative formulated product for the evaluation was Metam sodium 510 g/L, soluble concentrate (SL), registered under different trade names in Europe. Adequate methods are available to monitor all compounds given in the respective residue definition. However, it should be noted that the residue definition for plants and ground water are provisional. Only single methods for the determination of residues are available since a multi-residue-method like the German S19 or the Dutch MM1 is not applicable due to the nature of the residues. Sufficient analytical methods as well as methods and data relating to physical, chemical and technical properties are available to ensure that quality control measurements of the plant protection product are possible. There is a data gap for the flash point of the TK. Storage stability data where the relevant impurities are analysed for was also identified as a data gap. Spectra are available for the relevant impurity MITC2 but not for the other relevant impurity DMTU3 so this has also to be a data gap. As MITC is currently not specified in the technical specification a new specification is needed. As for mammalian toxicology, metam sodium is harmful by oral ingestion and inhalation (R22 and R20 proposed). In irritation tests, metam sodium was not irritant to eyes but was corrosive to skin, therefore R34 (Causes burns) was proposed. Metam sodium is a skin sensitiser (R43 May cause sensitisation by skin contact proposed). The relevant short term No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) are 0.1, 0.5 and 0.8 mg/kg bw/day in dogs, rats and mice, respectively. In particular, the occurrence of severe hepatotoxicity in dogs was considered to support the proposal of R48/22 (Danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure if swallowed) to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). Metam did not show any genotoxic potential, but caused angiosarcomas in mice, therefore R40 (Limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect) was proposed. The relevant long term NOAEL was 1.5 mg/kg bw/day based reduced bodyweight gain, specific lesion within the nasal passages, and changes in some haematology and spleen (haemosiderin depots) parameters in rats. In multigeneration tests, the relevant parental, reproductive and offspring NOAELs were 4, 12 and 4 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. Tested in developmental toxicity studies, metam sodium caused an increased incidence of variations and retardations at maternally toxic dose in rats and decreased number of live foetuses, increased number of dead implants in rabbits, with relevant maternal and developmental NOAEL in rats of 5 mg/kg bw/day and of 5 and 10 mg/kg bw/day, respectively, in rabbits. The malformations occurred at low incidences (sometimes in singularity), but in a consistent manner, at the top-doses, in the presence of quite severe maternal toxicity. Effects were clearly treatment related and associated with maternal toxicity: the classification as R63 (Possible risk of harm to the unborn child) was proposed for consideration to the ECHA. The Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) are 0.001 mg/kg bw/day, based on the 1-year dog study NOAEL with a Safety Factor (SF) 100; the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) is 0.1 mg/kg bw based on an overall rat developmental toxicity NOAEL and supported by rabbit developmental study. MITC is toxic via ingestion (R25 proposed) and via inhalation (R23 proposed). It is harmful in contact with skin (R21 proposed). In skin irritation tests it was corrosive to skin (R34 proposed). It was also irritative to the respiratory system (R37 proposed). It is a skin sensitiser (R43 proposed). The relevant NOAEL for short term exposure to MITC is 0.04 mg/kg bw/day, based on the thymus involution and liver vacuolation at 0.4 mg/kg bw/day. MITC did not show any genotoxic, carcinogenic, reproductive and developmental toxicity potential. The relevant NOAEL for long term toxicity is 0.44 mg/kg bw/day based on haematological changes in rats; the relevant parental NOAEL is 0.7 mg/kg bw/day, the reproductive and offspring NOAEL is >3.6 mg/kg bw/day. The relevant maternal and developmental toxicity NOAELs in rats are 3 and 10 mg/kg bw/day. The ADI and AOEL are 0.004 mg/kg bw/day based on the 1 year and 90-day studies in dog, respectively; the ARfD is 0.03 mg/kg bw based on NOAEL for rat maternal toxicity with SF 100. The operator exposure in open field is below the AOEL with the use of Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE); the bystander and worker exposure in the open field is below the AOEL without the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The PRAPeR meeting of experts considered the impurity DMTU as relevant, due to the lack of toxicological information. Metabolism studies were supplied but no metabolites were identified. It was noted that the majority of the metabolism studies were under dosed. The meeting of experts considered the under dosing and lack of identification. It was concluded that as long as fate and behaviour had not identified any significant metabolites in soil then the metabolism data could be accepted. At this time fate and behaviour are unable to conclude on this issue and therefore a data gap has been set to address this. As some of the impurities in the technical material are applied at significant levels the consumer risk for the impurities still has to be addressed. A data gap for new residue trials was identified. Currently the need for processing studies, rotational crops and livestock studies are not triggered. However, this is subject to the data gaps. The risk assessment can not be finalised and MRLs can not be proposed at this time as the residue trials data are identified as a data gap. Degradation of metam and its known active metabolite MITC in soil was investigated in four soils under dark aerobic conditions at 20 degrees C. The experts in the meeting were not confident that these experiments provided a realistic representation of the fate and behaviour of metam and MITC in soil mainly due to the mode of application used in the study with respect to the application in field where volatilization is minimized by compacting soil or with plastic films. However, the meeting noted that a number of scientific studies investigating the persistence of metam and MITC are available in the public domain and to regulatory authorities. Consequently, a data gap was identified by the meeting of experts to address the range of half-lives available for metam and MITC and whether they are applicable to metam EU risk assessment. The notifier should address the different variables that might impact on the degradation in soil, such as method of application dose rate and soil adaptation. Taking into consideration the application rates of metam (306 612 kg / ha), during the peer review it was considered that impurities need to be addressed for the potential environmental and ground water contamination. The notifier submitted an overview of the main impurities present in the technical material that was summarized by the RMS in the addendum (June 2008). The meeting of experts in toxicology agreed that the impurity DMTU should be regarded as toxicological relevant and therefore a will need a ground water exposure assessment. PEC soil for metam and MITC were calculated for the worst case use in field tomato (612 kg a.s. / ha) assuming 15 cm incorporation. Time dependent PEC soil need to be updated once the data gaps identified for persistence in soil are solved. Initial PECs in soil may be used for the EU risk assessment. Mobility of metam was investigated by the HPLC method. According this experiment metam may be considered to be very high mobile in soil. A batch adsorption / desorption study is available for MITC in four soils. This compound was very high mobile in these soils (K-foc = 27 mL / g). The meeting of experts concluded that adsorption in this study may have been overestimated due to the fact that experimental K-oc values are simultaneously affected by degradation and volatilization during the experiment. Therefore, the meeting of experts proposed a data gap for a new soil adsorption desorption study conducted with consideration of the volatility and the low adsorption properties of MITC (e.g. with shorter equilibration times, soil solution ratios of 1:1, high organic carbon soils). After the meeting of experts, a new data gap has been identified by EFSA to address the mobility of impurity DMTU in soil in order to obtain adequate input parameters for ground water modelling. Hydrolysis of metam is relatively fast at any pH. Hydrolysis of MITC at 25 degrees C occurs with half-lives of approximate to 40 d (pH 4), 50 d (pH 7) and 11 d (pH 9). Major hydrolysis products of MITC were DMU, DMTU and MDTA (metam). The fact that one of the major metabolites of MITC is metam indicates that in water metam and MITC are in equilibrium. Aqueous photolysis of metam under simulated sunlight is very fast (DT50 = 12 min; equivalent to 27.8 min at 38 degrees N). No readily biodegradation study is available and therefore the substance is considered to be non readily biodegradable. In the aerobic water /sediment experiment (25 degrees C) metam degrades rapidly in the whole system (DT50whole system = 0.32 h). The meeting agreed that the information provided by the notifier did not allow any quantitative estimation of the effect of temperature on the volatilization. Consequently, the meeting of experts identified a data gap to address the effect of temperature on the dissipation of MITC from water by volatilization. Depending on the results of the volatilization assessment, a new water sediment study at lower temperature may be necessary. The data from the anaerobic water sediment study were considered not relevant for the representative uses and it was not found scientifically justified to average dissipation rates from aerobic and anaerobic experiments Due to the data gaps identified on the derivation of various key modelling input parameters and to the fact that FOCUS SW modelling does not consider volatilization-deposition route of entry in surface water, the available PECSW were not considered appropriate for the EU risk assessment. The meeting of experts identified a data gap for worst case PECSW estimations of MITC taking into consideration short range transport and deposition to surface water bodies and potential exposure via drainage with adequate input parameters. The meeting of experts identified the need to recalculate MITC PECGW values with adequate input parameters (when available) using FOCUS GW or higher tier approach if appropriate. After the meeting of experts, a new data gap has been identified by EFSA to address the potential ground water contamination of impurity DMTU. The meeting of experts identified a data gap to address the atmospheric fate and behaviour of MITC including global warming (ozone depletion), long range transport and deposition, and to address the potential contamination of surface water and soil by deposition in the vicinity of the applied areas. The notifier and the RMS proposed in the DAR that due to the method of application of metam-sodium, the risk to birds and mammals was considered acceptable for the intended field uses. Member States experts suggested that the most probable contaminated food items for birds and mammals would be the soil invertebrates (including earthworms). The experts in the PRAPeR 53 agreed that the notifier should provide an acute risk assessment to assess the effects of metam-sodium and its metabolite MITC to terrestrial vertebrates feeding on soil invertebrates. The acute risk assessment should also be provided for the metabolite MITC using the lowest endpoint available of 100 mg a.s./kg bw, which was agreed during the meeting. Metam-sodium and its relevant metabolite MITC were very toxic to aquatic organisms based on the available data. Due to the rapid degradation of metam-sodium in soil, surface water contamination with the parent molecule could be excluded. Aquatic organisms may be exposed to the metabolite MITC as result of the drainage and run-off. The experts in the Fate and Behaviour meeting agreed that the PECsw for the MITC should be re-estimated by the notifier. As a consequence the aquatic risk assessment should be revisited, once the new PECsw could be available. An extended laboratory study was conducted with Aloechara bilineata and this aged residue study demonstrated that A. bilineata was able to recolonise the field after 55 days. From an extended laboratory study it was only possible to assess the potential for re-colonisation, but not the actual recovery. Therefore, the experts agreed that further refinement was required to address the recovery potential of the non-target arthropods and soil non-target macro-organisms. An earthworm field study was conducted with the metam-sodium. The experts agreed that after the application of the 608.4 kg a.s./ha, there was no clear indication of full recovery after one year. A further refinement was required from the notifier to address concerns on recovery/recolonisation of earthworms this should be include considerations on effects on recovery of different ecological groups as well as known data on migration distances. The risk of metam and its metabolite MITC to other soil macro-organisms should be addressed. The risk of metam and its metabolite MITC to bees, soil micro-organisms, non-target plants and biological method of sewage treatment was assessed as low from out-doors uses. The risk of metam and its metabolite MITC to terrestrial vertebrates, aquatic organisms, bees and non-target arthropods was assessed to be low in greenhouse uses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1831-4732,,,,,JAN,2009,7,1,,,,,,,,10.2903/j.efsa.2009.203r,http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2009.203r,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000422260900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Inside-out patches were excised directly from the SR of split skeletal muscle fibers of lobster, with lobster relaxing ringer (LRR) in bath and pipette. The power spectrum of open-channel noise is very low and approximately flat in the 100 Hz-10 kHz frequency range. At 20 degrees C, with an applied voltage of 50 mV, the mean single-channel current [i] is 9 pA (mean single-channel conductance = 180 pS) and the mean power spectral density 1.1 x 10(-29) A(2)/Hz. The latter increases nonlinearly with [i], showing a progressively steeper dependence as [i] increases. At 20 mV, the mean power spectral density is almost independent of [i] and similar to 1.4 times that of the Johnson noise calculated for the equivalent ideal resistor with zero net current; at 70 mV it increases approximately in proportion to [i](2). The mean power spectral density has a weak temperature dependence, very similar to that of [i], and both are well described by a Q(10) of 1.3 throughout the range 3-40 degrees C. Discrete ion transport events are thought to account for a significant fraction of the measured open-channel noise, probably similar to 30-50% at 50 mV. Brief interruptions of the single-channel current, due either to blockage of the open channel by an extrinsic aqueous species, or to intrinsic conformational changes in the channel molecule itself, were a possible additional source of open-channel noise. Experiments in modified bathing solutions indicate, however, that open-channel noise is not affected by any of the identified aqueous species present in LRR. In particular, magnesium ions, the species thought most likely to cause brief blockages, and calcium and hydrogen ions, have no detectable effect. This channel's openings exhibit many brief closings and substates, due to intrinsic gating of the channel. Unresolved brief full closings are calculated to make a negligible contribution (<1%) to the measured power spectral density. The only significant source of noise due to band width-limited missed events is brief, frequent 80% substates (mean duration 20 mu s, mean frequency 1,000 s(-1)) which account for a small part of the measured power spectral density (similar to 14%, at 50 mV, 20 degrees C). We conclude that a large fraction of the measured open-channel noise results from intrinsic conductance fluctuations, with a corner frequency higher than the resolution of our recordings, in the range 10(4)-10(7) Hz. We infer the presence of motions within the channel molecule in this frequency range.",,,,,"Eisenberg, Robert/P-6070-2019; Eisenberg, Robert S/G-8716-2018; Hainsworth, Atticus/J-8657-2019","Eisenberg, Robert S/0000-0002-4860-5434; Hainsworth, Atticus/0000-0001-7877-8013",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1295,1540-7748,,,,NOV,1994,104,5,,,,,857,883,,10.1085/jgp.104.5.857,http://dx.doi.org/10.1085/jgp.104.5.857,,,,,,,,7876826,,,,,WOS:A1994PT78200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their reproductive performance, in the context of climate stressors, had not been investigated so far. Our objective was to experimentally evaluate acute stress effects over gonad development after 6 days of low salinity stress in autumn, winter and spring as well as 4 days of heatwave stress during emersion in summer. These are the most probable extreme events that bivalves should face in our latitudes. Four different salinity ramps (5-20, 10-25, 1530, 30-30) were created during simulated tidal cycles in mesocosms for the low salinity experiments. Also four sediment heatwaves at emersion (20-20, 20-27, 2032, 20-37 degrees C) were done during simulated tidal cycle. Both low salinity and heatwave stresses over such short periods compromised reproduction; the acute response was species-specific and varied with the time of the year, and therefore, with the stage of the gametogenic cycle. In December, during sexual resting and the beginning of gametogenesis, a delay in gametogenesis at lower salinities was recorded in the four species. However, at the peak of the reproductive period (March and May), different responses were observed: abnormal oocytes in R. decussatus and resorption of gametes with haemocytic infiltration in R. philippinarum and V. corrugata. Likewise sediment temperatures higher than 32ffiC provoked gonadal resorption and severe haemocytic invasion in V. corrugata, R. decussatus, and C. edule but had no effect in R. philippinarum. These responses to both environmental stressors might be related to the allocation of energy from reproduction toward defense and repair mechanisms to ensure survival. Contrastingly, low salinities triggered massive spawning in C. edule that could lead to a mismatch between the presence of larvae and phytoplankton, causing potentially starvation and thus reducing recruitment success. Reproduction of theses bivalves would be compromised if low salinity episodes in winter and spring, even for short periods of time such as those in these experiments, are followed by a heatwave in summer. Furthermore the impact would be magnified if this situation happens during consecutive years preventing replenishment of the shellfish beds.",,,,,"Olabarria, Celia/R-8555-2018; Wethey, David S/K-8063-2014; Garcia Peteiro, Laura/B-6179-2014; Woodin, Sarah/K-8481-2014","Olabarria, Celia/0000-0001-8332-5924; Wethey, David S/0000-0002-2549-1606; Garcia Peteiro, Laura/0000-0001-9382-2502; Woodin, Sarah/0000-0001-5615-2212",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,AUG 2,2021,8,,,,,,,,685282,10.3389/fmars.2021.685282,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.685282,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000685250500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This has long been exploited in a seed technology termed priming, which increases germination speed and seedling vigour, but these benefits have often been associated with effects on seed lifespan, or longevity, with conflicting evidence for positive and negative effects. Seed longevity is a key seed trait influencing not only the storage of commercial stocks but also in situ and ex situ seed conservation. In the context of increasingly variable environmental conditions faced by both crops and wild species, this has led to renewed interest in understanding the molecular factors that underlie priming. Here, we provide an overview of the literature relating to the effect of priming on seed lifespan, and catalogue the different parameters used for priming treatments and their consequences on longevity for a range of species. Our current limited understanding of the molecular basis for priming effects is also outlined, with an emphasis on recent advances and promising approaches that should lead towards the application and monitoring of the priming process in a less empirical manner.",,,,,"Seo, Mitsunori/N-9603-2015; North, Helen/AAD-4964-2020","North, Helen/0000-0002-5749-2603; Sano, Naoto/0000-0003-2626-4699",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,MAR 29,2021,72,7,,,,,2312,2333,,10.1093/jxb/erab004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erab004,,JAN 2021,,,,,,33512455,,,,,WOS:000639080100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Genotypes with a non-linear TR response to VPD are expected to achieve yield gains under terminal drought, thanks to a water conservation strategy, while those with a linear response exhibit a consumptive strategy that is more adequate for well-watered or transient-drought environments. In wheat, previous efforts indicated that TR has a genetic basis under naturally fluctuating conditions, but because TR is responsive to variation in temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and evaporative demand, the genetic basis of its response VPD per se has never been isolated. To address this, we developed a controlled-environment gravimetric phenotyping approach where we imposed VPD regimes independent from other confounding environmental variables. We screened three nested association mapping populations totaling 150 lines, three times over a 3-year period. The resulting dataset, based on phenotyping nearly 1400 plants, enabled constructing 63-point response curves for each genotype, which were subjected to a genome-wide association study. The analysis revealed a hotspot for TR response to VPD on chromosome 5A, with SNPs explaining up to 17% of the phenotypic variance. The key SNPs were found in haploblocks that are enriched in membrane-associated genes, consistent with the hypothesized physiological determinants of the trait. These results indicate a promising potential for identifying new alleles and designing next-gen wheat cultivars that are better adapted to current and future drought regimes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-9317,1399-3054,,,,SEP,2022,174,5,,,,,,,e13752,10.1111/ppl.13752,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.13752,,,,,,,,36281842,,,,,WOS:000849805300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we investigate the effect of short-term (days) soil environmental conditions on microbial community structure and composition during a natural wetting and drying cycle. Soil samples were collected from a meadow in Northern California at four time points after the first two rainfall events of the rainy season. We used 16S rRNA microarrays (PhyloChip) to track changes in bacterial and archaeal community composition. Microbial communities at time points 1 and 3 were significantly different than communities at time points 2 and 4. Based on ordination analysis, the available carbon, soil moisture, and temperature explained most of the variation in community structure. For the first time, a complementary and more comprehensive approach using linear regression and generalized logical networks were used to identify linear and nonlinear associations among environmental variables and with the relative abundance of subfamilies. Changes in soil moisture and available carbon were correlated with the relative abundance of many phyla. Only the phylum Actinobacteria showed a lineage-specific relationship to soil moisture but not to carbon or nitrogen. The results indicate that the use of a high taxonomic rank in correlations with nutritional indicators might obscure divergent subfamily-level responses to environmental parameters.

The microtubule is modeled as a nonlocal shear deformable cylindrical shell which contains small scale effects. The governing equations are based on higher order shear deformation shell theory with a von Karman-Donnell-type of kinematic nonlinearity and include the extension-twist and flexural-twist couplings. The thermal effects are also included and the material properties are assumed to be temperature-dependent. A singular perturbation technique is employed to determine the buckling pressure and postbuckling equilibrium paths. The small scale parameter e(o)a is estimated by matching the buckling pressure of MTs measured from the experiments with the numerical results obtained from the nonlocal shear deformable shell model. The numerical results show that buckling pressure and postbuckling behavior of MTs are very sensitive to the small scale parameter eoa. The results reveal that the 13_3 microtubule has a stable postbuckling path, whereas the 13_2 microtubule has an unstable postbuckling behavior due to the presence of skew angles.

Although the duration of snow cover is generally expected to decrease in the future as a result of global warming, the amounts of snow might increase in arctic areas where much of the elevated precipitation will fall as snow. We examined the effects of an increased snow cover, as a result of a snow fence treatment, on soil nitrogen mineralization, plant phenology, plant chemistry (nitrogen and potential defense compounds), the level of invertebrate herbivory, and performance of invertebrate herbivores in an arctic ecosystem, using dwarf birch (Betula nana) and the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) as study organisms. An enhanced and prolonged snow cover increased the level of herbivory on dwarf birch leaves. Larvae feeding on plants that had experienced enhanced snow cover grew faster and pupated earlier than larvae fed with plant material from control plots, indicating that plants from enhanced snow-lie plots produce higher-quality food to herbivores. The increased larval growth rate was strongly correlated with higher leaf nitrogen concentration in plants subjected to snow manipulation, and also to certain phenolic acids. Snow manipulation did not change net nitrogen mineralization rates in the soil or total carbon concentration in leaves, but it altered the within-season fluctuating pattern of leaf phenolic compounds.

They protect the plant from invading pathogens and herbivores by representing constitutive or induced defense mechanisms. Moreover, antioxidant properties of some terpenes have also been shown, suggesting their role in overcoming oxidative stress provoked by internal and external stimuli. The abiotic and biotic stress factors such as drought, temperature fluctuations, air and soil pollution or pathogen attack rearrange the biosynthesis and emission of terpenes, however the response may depend on the stressor type and stress intensity. Although the general composition of terpenes is characteristic for each species, it has been shown that it can even differ between two individual trees. Reaching for the available literature data, the review is focused on systematizing the observed changes in terpene quantity and quality in the three most important forest-forming conifer genera of European temperate climate zone - pine (Pinus sp.), spruce (Picea sp.) and fir (Abies sp.).

The FMBR was filled with an engineered mixture of adsorption media made of natural and recyclable materials and operates on a 24 h continuous cycle, powered by a small photovoltaic pumping system. Significant reductions in TP and TN were documented across the FMBR achieving varying degree of removal efficiencies for storm and non-storm events with fluctuating temperatures.

Different slurry application techniques can influence the emission of GHG. In the years 2014 and 2015, two, parallel trials (sites: Luckstedt and Kossebau) and one lysimeter trial (site: Falkenberg) were set up in Central Germany (federal state: Saxony-Anhalt) in order to investigate the influence of the slurry strip-till method on ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions when compared to surface slurry incorporation. The effect of the nitrification inhibitor (NI) (PIADIN((R))) on GHG emissions was also examined. NH3 was measured using a combination of passive samplers and the Drager Tube method (DTM). N2O was measured using the closed chamber method (CCM) both in the maize row and in the interrow space. In the two years of the experiment, NH3 volatilization fluctuated between 0.6 and 3.5 kg NH3-N ha(-1). In 2014, the slurry strip-till treatments in Lacicstedt emitted significantly less NH3 than surface slurry incorporation. In 2015, at the Kossebau site NH3 volatilization was significantly lower in the treatments with NI than those with no NI. In both years, N2O emissions were between 0.5 kg and 2 kg N2O-N ha(-1). In the lysimeter trial, in 2014 significantly higher N2O emissions were detected in the unfertilized control than in the fertilized treatments. In the plot trial in Kossebau, in 2015 significantly lower N2O emissions were recorded in the row than interrow. These differences are probably due to the uptake of mineral nitrogen by the plants in the row as a starting material for nitrification and denitrification. In Kossebau there were significant correlations between N2O emissions and soil temperature. As regards the slurry strip-till method, no significant reduction in N2O emissions was observed in comparison to surface slurry incorporation. The influence of the slurry strip-till method on NH3 and N2O emissions depends on annual weather conditions and it cannot generally be regarded as preferable to conventional, surface slurry incorporation.

Moss communities constitute much of the understory in Arctic vegetation, and as poikilohydric plants moss are highly sensitive to timing and duration of moisture levels. Here we investigate the role of moisture content on NDVI, red and near-infrared reflectance, and gross primary productivity (GPP) of two sphagnum and two pleurocarpus moss community types during two separate drying experiments. For both experiments, blocks of moss were collected near Imnavait Creek, Alaska, saturated to full water capacity, and then allowed to air dry before being re-saturated. Drying of blocks was conducted in a translucent outdoor tent during the first experiment and under indoor climate-controlled conditions during the second. Community NDVI (experiment 1 and 2), and GPP (experiment 2) were measured at regular intervals during the dry-down and after rewetting. In both experiments, moss NDVI sharply declined between 80% and 70% moisture content for sphagnum moss communities (NDVI change = -0.17 to -0.2), but less so for pleurocarpus moss communities (NDVI change = -0.06 to -0.12). Changes in NDVI were largely the result of increases in reflectance in red wavelengths. Peak GPP for all community types in the second experiment (1.31 to 2.08 mu mo] m(-2)s(-1)) occurred at 80% moisture content and declined significantly as moisture content decreased. Rates of GPP continued to decline below 80% moisture content until near zero as moss reached a steady weight (air dry) over a period of 84 h, while NDVI values declined slowly between 70% hydration and fully air dry. Re-saturation caused NDVI to increase in both sphagnum (NDVI change = + 0.18 to + 0.23) and pleurocarpus (NDVI change = + 0.10 to + 0.17) communities. Only sphagnum communities showed GPP resuming (0.824 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) after 24 h. The strong changes in NDVI and mismatch of moss NDVI values and GPP with moisture content fluctuations indicate that using NDVI as a proxy for productivity in Arctic vegetation communities may be problematic and underscores the need for quantification of moss community coverage, composition, and moisture content.",,,,,"Parker, Thomas/GNP-1839-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0034-4257,1879-0704,,,,JUN,2018,212,,,,,,114,120,,10.1016/j.rse.2018.04.041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.04.041,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000435053200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

By combining targeted experiments with routine monitoring, we evaluated immediate impacts of two successive storm events on water quality and phytoplankton community response in the tidal James River and compared these findings to a non-storm year. The James River is a subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay and sampling was conducted before, during, and after Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm (TS) Lee in 2011 and during the same time period (late summer/early fall) in 2012 when there were no storms. We collected and compiled data on nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, phytoplankton abundance, nitrogen uptake, primary productivity rates, and surface salinity, temperature, and turbidity in the meso- and polyhaline segments of the James River. Hurricane Irene introduced significant amounts of freshwater over the entire James River and Chesapeake Bay watersheds, while rainfall from TS Lee fell primarily on the tidal fresh region of the James River and headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay. Dinoflagellates dominated the algal community in the meso- and polyhaline segments prior to the storms in 2011, and a mixed diatom community emerged after the storms. In the mesohaline river segment, cyanobacteria abundance increased after TS Lee when salinities were depressed, likely due to washout from the oligohaline and tidal fresh regions of the river. In 2012, dinoflagellates dominated the community in both segments of the river during late summer but diatoms were also abundant and their biomass fluctuated throughout the summer and fall. Cyanobacteria were not present in either segment. Overall, we observed that the high-intensity rainfall from Hurricane Irene combined with high flushing in the headwaters as a result of TS Lee likely reduced primary productivity and altered community composition in the mesohaline segment but not the more estuarine-influenced polyhaline segment.

For example, pond drying can lead to increased predation and competition as resources become limited and temperature and water quality undergo drastic fluctuations. Amphibians provide an excellent model for studying factors associated with survival in temporary habitats. Aquatic amphibians developing in ephemeral habitats must find food, avoid predators, and cope with potentially great fluctuations in abiotic parameters under increasingly harsh conditions. In Oregon (U.S.A.), larval long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) often inhabit temporary ponds that gradually dry during the summer. We have been studying several factors that may influence long-toed salamander behavior, growth, and survival in ephemeral montane ponds in the Cascade Range. These include biotic interactions focusing on cannibalism and predation, and abiotic factors, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation, an agent that can harm developing amphibians. Long-toed salamanders living in ephemeral ponds, like some other salamander species, exhibit trophic polymorphism, with some individuals having disproportionately broader and longer heads and enlarged vomerine teeth. The ingestion of different types of prey contributes to plasticity in head shape but other cues are essential to induce extreme trophic polymorphism. During periods of food limitation, individuals capable of using alternative food sources, including conspecifics, may experience a competitive advantage over their conspecifics. Morphological plasticity may therefore play an important role in resource partitioning and in alleviating intraspecific competition. The results of field experiments suggest that long-toed salamander embryos are highly susceptible to ambient levels of U-V-B radiation. UV radiation reduces hatching success and increases deformities. Laboratory tests suggest that larvae from populations from high elevations may be more resistant to U-V-B radiation than larvae from low-elevation populations. Like other amphibian species that may inhabit temporary ponds, tong-toed salamanders are potentially vulnerable to a wide array of pollutants, including those associated with nitrate and nitrite fertilizers. Synergistic interactions with a number of agents, including UV radiation and various toxic substances, may be especially harmful to long-toed salamanders.",,,,,,"Belden, Lisa/0000-0002-3514-3920",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-2210,,,,,,2001,47,4,,,,,333,345,,10.1560/96FA-AAL4-NECX-KEEY,http://dx.doi.org/10.1560/96FA-AAL4-NECX-KEEY,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000174653100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A pulse amplitude fluorometer, an instrument which does not require physical contact with the sample, was used, thus allowing successive measurements to be taken on the same sample without causing any type of disturbance to the sediment structure. The basis of the method is the possibility to detect changes in the Chi a concentration near the sediment surface caused by the vertical movement of the microalgae. This requires the verification of two conditions: the possibility to follow changes in the sediment Chi a content from fluorescence intensity, and a sediment photic depth smaller than the vertical distances covered by the moving microalgae. Both conditions were experimentally verified in intertidal muddy sediments of the Tagus estuary, Portugal. In vivo fluorescence was shown to vary linearly with the sediment Chi a content, and the sediment photic depth was estimated to reach 0.27 mm, a value clearly smaller than the reported depths for microalgal migrations. Sediment samples kept under in situ conditions exhibited large hourly variations (over 400%) in the Chi a fluorescence intensity, which were closely synchronized with the daytime periods of emersion. The rhythmic fluctuations in Chi a fluorescence were confirmed further to represent microalgal migration by (1) its endogenous nature (fluorescence continued to follow diurnal and tidal cycles after removal of environmental stimuli), (2) its dependence on the vertical distribution of the microalgal population within the sediment (vertically homogenized samples failed to display fluorescence variations), and (3) the lack of significant temperature and light effects on the fluorescence emission under in situ conditions (tested in three species representative of the main groups found in the studied microphytobenthic communities-the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (Bohlin), the cyanobacterium Spirulina maxima (Setch. et Gard.), and the euglenophyte Euglena granulata (Klebs) Lemm.).

In an attempt to identify the causes of this behaviour the retention of seed mussels was experimentally determined after exposure to three sub-lethal stressors, desiccation, starvation, and temperature fluctuation. In addition, two types of mussel seed behaviour were tested for their potential for developing a commercially useful method for identifying seed mussels with high retention properties prior to seeding. The two behaviours were the ability of seed mussels to attach by byssus threads to the substrate in slow flowing water, and the ability of seed mussels to pedal walk vertically up through a substrate filled column. Of the three stressors tested only desiccation and starvation significantly reduced mussel seed retention compared to unstressed controls by 38% (P < 0.05) and 42% (P < 0.05) respectively. Of the two types of mussel seed behaviour used for attempting to sort seed mussels, only the ability of seed mussels to attach by byssus threads to the substrate in slow flowing water showed any sensitivity for identifying individuals with higher retention properties (P < 0.05). Seed mussels that failed to byssal attach had a 23% lower mean retention, after 10 d experimental grow-out compared to seed that successfully attached. Although significant, this difference was relatively small and is unlikely to provide the basis for the development of a useful commercial seed mussel sorting method. Desiccation and starvation are both stressors that seed mussels are likely to experience during their commercial harvesting, transportation and seeding process. Consequently, seed mussels need to be relayed quickly and under moist conditions to reduce the potential for starvation and desiccation stress. Identifying seed mussels in poor nutritional condition and feeding them prior to seeding out on farms could also help to prevent the intermittent large scale seed mussel losses currently experienced. The application of these findings will assist in making more efficient use of the wild seed mussel resource and significantly lower financial losses to growers in New Zealand.

Field experiments were carried out at three sites in southern Ethiopia using suckers of several clones to generate crop physiological parameters and to describe the time course of leaf number, leaf area and plant height. Yield potentials at different sites were estimated using these parameters and weather data, and compared with the actual yield. Plant height and LAI increased faster at Awassa and Areka than at Hagereselam because of a higher leaf appearance rate associated with temperatures being closer to the optimum. The trend in plant height was best described by a logistic function, whereas the trend in LAI was best described by a logistic function only at Awassa and Areka. A high leaf appearance rate (0.18 leaves day(-1)) during early growth at Awassa and Areka made it possible that leaves that were senesced during unfavourable climatic conditions could be rapidly replaced without strong fluctuation in leaf area index. At Hagereselam, however, the rate of leaf appearance (0.09 leaves day(-1)) was too small to compensate for the decline in the number of green leaves per plant during adverse conditions and thus LAI fluctuated over the whole growing period. The trend in fraction of PAR intercepted was best described by a generalised logistic function. At 300 days after transplanting the suckers, LAI reached a value of 4.5 and enset clones intercepted 92-97% of incoming PAR. The mean extinction coefficient was between 0.56-0.91 and radiation use efficiency (RUE) ranged from 1.43-2.67 g MJ(-1). Dry matter kocho yield potentials of 17.1 to 33.9 t ha(-1) yr(-1) were estimated for enset clones. Important yield potential differences existed between clones mainly because of differences in radiation use efficiency that was probably partly associated with viral infection. The average ratio of actual yield:yield potential (0.24) was low mainly because of large losses associated with traditional fermentation techniques, yield reducing cultivation methods such as repetitive transplanting and leaf pruning, presence of diseases, lack of adequate fertilisation and shortage and uneven distribution of rainfall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-4746,,,,,,2003,142,1,,,,,71,81,,10.1111/j.1744-7348.2003.tb00231.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2003.tb00231.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000181317500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Analysis of the rate constants confirmed the low/no quantum mechanical tunneling effect in the studied temperature range and that inclusion of the fluctuation of the local dielectric environment in the mechanistic model was essential. Because the computed rate constants are not compatible with the time resolution of the stopped-flow spectrophotometric experiment, the direct route for generating beta-MeSt after CO2 elimination (acid catalyst (2)) is unlikely to be utilized, thereby confirming that indirect cycloelimination in a low local dielectric environment is the rate determining step. The thermodynamic results showed that the elementary reactions that involve charge (proton) transfer are affected by solvent polarity, thereby leading to the conclusion that overall, the enzymatic decarboxylation of alpha,beta-unsaturated acid is thermodynamically controlled at high e. The entropy changes due to the generation of molecules in the active site appeared more pronounced than that due to only covalent bond breaking/formation or structural reorientation. This work examined in detail for the first time the scenarios in each elementary reaction and provided insight into the effect of the fluctuations in the local dielectric environment on the enzymatic decarboxylation of alpha,beta-unsaturated acids. These results could be used as guidelines for further theoretical and experimental studies on the same and similar systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2046-2069,,,,MAY 5,2022,12,22,,,,,14223,14234,,10.1039/d2ra02626k,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra02626k,,,,,,,,35558849,,,,,WOS:000793319400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Currently, the AALS has a significant impact on the regional ecosystem and socio-economic conditions of the region. Studying and evaluating the AALS hydrology, the water volume, surface area, and variability of water levels altogether play an important role in the development of fisheries and ecotourism in the region. However, in the past studies, the dynamic changes in the volume, area, and water levels of the AALS have not been investigated through up-to-the-date geo-information systems (GIS), requiring additional research to formulate a proper methodology considering the potential aspects of GIS. Therefore, this paper aims at analyzing the dynamics of changes in the water level, surface area, and water volume of the AALS by using GIS technologies within 1993-2017 years. During the period from 1993 to 2006, the water level and the surface area of the AALS steeply increased and remained stable with negligible positive and negative fluctuations in the rest of the experimental years. These findings were successfully tested and validated by ANOVA, indicating an exceptionally low F-significance of 0.0008. According to the AALS's water volume dynamics, we investigated here the role of two factors: anthropogenic-the outflow water discharge from the reservoir located in the neighboring country; and natural-the amount of perennial precipitation. Consequently, we ascertained that the role of precipitation as a natural driving factor in expansion is majorly less than the outflow water from the reservoir, despite having a gradual increase in the perennial precipitation trend. As we assume that the hydrological characteristics of the AALS are strongly dependent on air temperature and the amount of precipitation due to the extreme restriction of outflow water discharge from the reservoir, thus the establishment of proper GIS-tracking and monitoring methodology is recommended to early warn the potential minor changes which could become severe in the near future.",,,,,"Khasanov, Sayidjakhon/GWB-9958-2022","Khasanov, Sayidjakhon/0000-0003-1928-6486",,,,,,,,,,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,MAR,2021,28,10,,,SI,,12245,12255,,10.1007/s11356-020-11959-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11959-7,,JAN 2021,,,,,,33405135,,,,,WOS:000605574200037,View Full Record in Web of Science

Under this scenario, organisms should maintain or develop strategies to cope with environmental fluctuations, such as the capacity to modify growth trajectories. However, altering growth can have negative consequences for organisms' fitness. Here, we investigated the metabolic alterations induced by compensatory growth during the larval development of the common frog (Rana temporaria), quantifying changes in oxidative stress, corticosterone levels and telomere length. We induced compensatory growth responses by exposing frog embryos to cold conditions (i.e. a 'false spring' scenario), which cause a delay in hatching. Once hatched, we reared larvae at two different photoperiods (24:0, representing the natural photoperiod of larvae, and 18:6) to test also for the interactive effects of light on growth responses. Larvae experiencing delayed hatching showed fast compensatory responses and reached larger size at metamorphosis. Larvae shortened their developmental period in response to delayed hatching. Non-permanent light conditions resulted in relaxed growth compared with larvae reared under permanent light conditions, which grew at their natural photoperiod and closer to their maximal rates. Growth responses altered the redox status and corticosterone levels of larvae. These physiological changes were developmental stage-dependent and mainly affected by photoperiod conditions. At catch-up, larvae reared at 18:6 light:dark cycles showed higher antioxidant activities and glucocorticoid secretion. On the contrary, larvae reared at 24:0 developed at higher rates without altering their oxidative status, likely an adaptation to grow under very restricting seasonal conditions at early life. At metamorphosis, compensatory responses induced higher cellular antioxidant activities probably caused by enhanced metabolism. Telomere length remained unaltered by experimental treatments but apparently tended to elongate across larval ontogeny, which would be a first evidence of telomere lengthening across metamorphosis. Under the forecasted increase in extreme climatic events, adjusting growth and developmental rates to the dynamics of environmental fluctuations may be essential for survival, but it can carry metabolic costs and affect later performance. Understanding the implications of such costs will be essential to properly estimate the impact of climate change on wild animals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAR,2020,89,3,,,,,855,866,,10.1111/1365-2656.13138,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13138,,,,,,,,31693168,,,,,WOS:000518225400016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study of these two physiological parameters of energy acquisition (CR and IR) demonstrates that the two types of seed showed significant differences in these parameters at the start of the experiment and after the first 8 days on the raft. After 15 days, large increases in these physiological rates were observed for both types of seed, with the increase for the rocky shore mussels doubling that of the collector rope specimens. These increases led to the disappearance of the significant differences in CR and IR between both seed origins, with this situation being maintained for the remainder of the experimental period. The variation in CR follows a seasonal pattern, with low values being recorded in winter and increasing in spring and summer, Minor seasonal variations of total seston concentration are counterbalanced. by an inverse variation in organic content, and so organic IR followed a pattern similar to that of CR. This seasonal variation can be attributed to fluctuations in the factors food quality (Q(1)) and temperature, in this order, as the use of multiple regression analysis has proved. Seed origin had a significant effect as a factor of interaction with food quality Q(1), probably because of differences between the original habitats of the seed (rocky shore and collector ropes) in the latter factor. Although in this study food quality has been expressed in terms of organic content (Q(1) = organic/total particulate matter), the content of phytoplankton as chlorophyll a may have had an important effect on the variation of both of these physiological rates. A significant exponential relationship has been established between the IR and the content in total particulate matter, which suggests regulation processes according to the amount of natural food available based on a decrease of CR.",,,,,"Fernandez-Reiriz, MJ/B-9014-2013; Babarro, Jose MF/F-1175-2016; Labarta, Uxio/D-5644-2012","Babarro, Jose/0000-0001-6352-1944",,,,,,,,,,,,,0730-8000,,,,,JUN,2000,19,1,,,,,195,201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088636000033,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effect of wintering method on population decreases of colonies was highly significant (P<0.01) in first year: but it was not significant in second year. However, it was found that the effect of interaction between hive type and wintering method on population decrease was not significant. The average food consumptions of colonies in wooden hives were higher than those of colonies in styrofoam hives, which might be due to less population decrease of colonies in wooden hives. As a result, wooden hives should be used for wintering to reduced the colony losses and bee mortality in the surviving colonies in Ezurum conditions. It was found that overwintering colonies outdoor without taking any precaution was not economic. Wintering colonies indoor or under a shed should be prefered to the wintering outdoor to reduce food consumption and bee losses.

M.",,,Climate and tillage system drive weed communities' functional diversity in a Mediterranean cereal-legume rotation,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"The first step to develop an environmentally sound weed management is to know how weed communities respond to environmental drivers. Among these, climate and management practices are probably the more determinant factors for annual plants community assembly. In this framework, a trait based approach may be useful to assess weed community responses and the processes behind them. Here, we focused on three non-inversion tillage practices which differently affect soil conditions and the vertical distribution of weed seeds. We also took into account the climate variability across years. We specifically asked whether the type of non-inversion tillage system and the annual variability in climatic conditions explain the differences in the functional structure of weed communities. To assess this question we conducted a nine yearlong field experiment in which three non-inversion tillage systems were compared: subsoil tillage, minimum tillage and no-tillage. We characterized the functional structure of weed communities by first obtaining data on three resource acquisition traits (specific leaf area, plant height and growth habit) and five regenerative traits (seed weight, longevity index, dispersal structures, seed cover and emergence time). Then, we computed the community weighted mean (CWM) and the mean pairwise distance (MPD) of each trait as well as a multi trait MPD index. Climate annual conditions were characterized based on autumn-winter precipitation, average temperature and number of frost days. We found that tillage systems and climatic factors mainly sorted weed species according to their emergence time and seed weight. Weed communities from no-tillage plots were characterized by having an earlier emergence and seeds without pericarp. Regarding climatic conditions, we found that warmer and rainier autumn-winter conditions were related to lower functional diversity of regenerative traits and higher diversity in terms of resource acquisition traits. Our results highlight that factors affecting seedling emergence as well as traits related to these processes are critical during weed community assemblage. Our results also showed that none of the compared tillage systems was clearly outstanding in terms of functional diversity, but that each system benefited certain functional design. Furthermore, the relative importance of these management practices to drive weed functional structure was clearly lower than the effects of climatic inter-annual fluctuations.",,,,,"Plaza, Eva Hernández/AAM-7431-2020; Víllora, María Remedios Alarcón/AAB-3339-2022","Plaza, Eva Hernández/0000-0002-2378-2602; Sanchez, Ana M./0000-0002-6220-3001; Alarcon Villora, Maria Remedios/0000-0003-0078-8363",,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-8809,1873-2305,,,,NOV 1,2019,283,,,,,,,,106574,10.1016/j.agee.2019.106574,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2019.106574,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000500210500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The samples were stored at temperatures +2 +/- 2 degrees C for 18 days. Changes in gas volumes (CO2 and O-2) in MA(s) were also monitored. CO2 levels increased in MA1 but decreased in MA2. At the end of 18 days of storage, a significantly (P < 0.01) lower water activity (a(w)) levels were found in samples packaged under MA1, in contrast to samples packaged under MA2 where activity values showed considerable fluctuation. Variations in pH values in two types of MA showed similar trends. Sample pH gradually decreased until day 9 of storage. Only day 11, muscle tissue pH increased markedly and then began to decrease again. The overall decrease in pH values was more profound in samples packaged under MA1. TVBN and TMA levels in samples packaged under the two types of MA(s) remained almost identical until day 9 of the experiment. Later, however, significantly (P < 0.01) higher levels of both parameters were found in muscle tissue packaged under MA1. FFa concentrations in silver carp samples in MA1 were significantly lower (P < 0.01) throughout the experiment. The PV increased significantly in both muscle samples tested. Greater fluctuations in this parameter's values throughout the experiment were observed in samples packaged under MA2. faster rates of oxidation (P < 0.01) were found in samples packaged under MA1 starting on day 9. Maximum TBA values in MA1 and MA2 were observed on days 14 and 18 of the experiment, respectively.

The presence of many juvenile fish (mainly O-group) and crustaceans indicated the important role played by the intertidal zone as a nursery ground. The brown shrimp, Crangon crangon and O-group plaice, Pleuronectes platessa are the two most abundant species of the intertidal ecosystem. Plaice settlement period extended from mid-March to early June. Over the survey period, densities increased to maximum numbers of about 27 ind. 10m(-2) in mid-April. In the following week, density rapidly decreased due to mortality and migration into deeper waters. The mortality was attributed mainly to predation by brown shrimp (C. crangon) and to a lesser extent by the shore crab (Carcinus maenas). The mean size of 0-group plaice increased from 19 mm in mid-April to 58 mm in July. Growth of juvenile 0-group plaice is described by an exponential equation: total length (TL, mm) = 12.602 e(0.022 (post-settlement age)). Post-settlement growth rates, estimated by otolith microstructure analysis, were 0.38 mm d(-1) for plaice less than or equal to30 turn and 0.61 mm d(-1) for plaice >30 mm. Settlement of juvenile brown shrimp started in mid-April, peaked in early June (93 ind. 10m(-2)) and continued with fluctuating intensity throughout the summer. Growth rate of juvenile C crangon, estimated after the settlement peak, was 0.163mm d(-1). Growth conditions of juvenile plaice and C crangon were analysed by comparing estimated growth in the field with predicted maximum growth according to temperature-growth rate models from experimental studies of growth with unlimited food supply. For plaice, the estimated growth rate was lower (plaice less than or equal to30 mm) but similar (plaice >30 mm) to the predicted maximum growth suggesting a food limitation only for newly settled individual. The observed increase in mean length of juvenile C crangon was lower than the maximum possible growth. The function of the intertidal zone in the early juvenile stages of marine species is discussed.

J.; Pastres, R.",,,Using a clustering algorithm to identify patterns of valve-gaping behaviour in mussels reared under different environmental conditions,ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Physiological adaptations for inhabiting transitional environments with strongly variable abiotic conditions can sometimes be displayed as behavioural shifts. A striking example might be found in bivalve species that inhabit estuaries characterised by fluctuations in environment. The opening and closing of their valves, so called gaping activity, represents behaviour that is required for two key physiological functions: food intake and respiration. Linking valve-gaping behaviour to environmental drivers can greatly improve our understanding and modelling of bivalve bioenergetics. Nowadays large data sets on gaping activity can be collected with automated sensors, but interpretation is difficult due to the large amount of environmental drivers and the intra-individual variability. This study aims to understand whether an unsupervised machine learning method (k-means clustering) can be used to identify patterns in gaping activity.Two commercially important congener mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis and Mytilus edulis inhabiting two transitional coastal areas, the Venice Lagoon and the Wadden Sea, were fitted with sensors to monitor valvegaping, while a comprehensive set of environmental parameters was also monitored. Data were analysed by applying three times a k-mean algorithm to the gaping time series. In the 1st analyses, the algorithm was applied to the overall gaping time series, including daily variations. We identified at both sites three clusters that were characterised by different average daily gaping aperture. The algorithm was subsequently reapplied to relate daily means of gaping to environmental conditions, being temperatures, oxygen saturation and chlorophyll levels. This 2nd analyses revealed that mean gaping aperture was mainly linked to food availability. A 3rd follow-up analysis aimed at exploring daily patterns. This third analysis again revealed consistent patterns amongst the two sites, where two clusters emerged that showed different degrees of oscillatory behaviour. There was however no obvious relationship between this fine scale oscillatory behaviours and environmental variables, but in the Venice Lagoon there was a site effect. Overall, we show that clustering algorithms can disentangle behavioural patterns within complex series of big data. The latter offers new opportunities to improve sitespecific bioenergetic bivalve models by rephrasing the clearance and respiration terms based on the mean gaping aperture, provided that further laboratory experimentations are conducted to extrapolate parameters linking aperture with energy inputs and outputs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1574-9541,1878-0512,,,,JUL,2022,69,,,,,,,,101659,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101659,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101659,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000804051300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study was aimed to broaden an understanding of the ability of trees to acclimate with the increasing atmospheric humidity predicted for northern Europe. Rapidly-induced water deficit was imposed by dehydrating cut branches in open-air conditions; long-term water deficit was generated by seasonal drought. Results: The rapid water deficit quantified by leaf (psi(L)) and branch water potentials (psi(B)) had a significant (P < 0.001) effect on gas exchange parameters, while inclusion of psi(B) in models resulted in a considerably better fit than those including psi(L), which supports the idea that stomatal openness is regulated to prevent stem rather than leaf xylem dysfunction. Under moderate water deficit (psi(L)>=-1.55 MPa), leaf conductance to water vapour (g(L)), transpiration rate and leaf hydraulic conductance (K-L) were higher (P < 0.05) and leaf temperature lower in trees grown in elevated air humidity (H treatment) than in control trees (C treatment). Under severe water deficit (psi(L)<-1.55 MPa), the treatments showed no difference. The humidification manipulation influenced most of the studied characteristics, while the effect was to a great extent realized through changes in soil water availability, i.e. due to higher soil water potential in H treatment. Two functional characteristics (g(L), K-L) exhibited higher (P < 0.05) sensitivity to water deficit in trees grown under increased air humidity. Conclusions: The experiment supported the hypothesis that physiological traits in trees acclimated to higher air humidity exhibit higher sensitivity to rapid water deficit with respect to two characteristics - leaf conductance to water vapour and leaf hydraulic conductance. Disproportionate changes in sensitivity of stomatal versus leaf hydraulic conductance to water deficit will impose greater risk of desiccation-induced hydraulic dysfunction on the plants, grown under high atmospheric humidity, in case of sudden weather fluctuations, and might represent a potential threat in hemiboreal forest ecosystems.

Correlations between final season biomass and cumulative O-3 exposures, combined with twofold growth reductions in an open-top chamber experiment provided strong evidence that higher cumulative O-3 exposures in rural sites reduced growth in the country. Here, we assess the field gas exchange, growth and development, and allocation responses underlying the observed growth differences and compare them with isolated O-3 responses documented in the open-top chamber experiment. Cottonwoods showed no visible foliar injury, reduced photosynthesis of recently expanded foliage, early leaf senescence, protective reduction in stomatal conductance, or compensatory allocation to shoot relative to root biomass for either the chamber or field experiment. Instead, O-3-impacted chamber plants had significantly higher conductance and reduced photosynthesis of older foliage that led to reduced leaf area production and a twofold biomass reduction in the absence of visible injury. Rural-grown field plants showed the same pattern of significantly higher conductance in the absence of concomitant increases in photosynthesis that was indicative of a loss of stomatal control. Incremental changes in foliar production were also significantly inversely related to fluctuations in ambient O-3 exposures. The similarity in biomass, gas exchange, phenological, and allocation responses between chamber and field experiments indicate that mechanisms accounting for reduced growth at rural sites were consistent with those in the open-top chamber O-3 experiment. This study shows the limitation of visible symptoms as a sole diagnostic factor for documenting detrimental O-3 impacts and points toward a new approach to show O-3 impacts when visible injury is not present. Namely, O-3-impacted vegetation showed an unusual inverse relationship of increased conductance with lower photosynthesis of older foliage that was indicative of a loss of stomatal control. This increased stomatal conductance Of O-3-impacted vegetation accentuates pollutant flux into affected foliage and has important implications for system water balance during warm, dry portions of the growing season when O-3 concentrations are highest.",,,,,"Jones, Clive G/I-4603-2014","Jones, Clive G/0000-0001-7630-7285",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,,,,,DEC,2006,16,6,,,,,2368,2381,,10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[2368:PADEOO]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[2368:PADEOO]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,17205911,,,,,WOS:000242849300025,View Full Record in Web of Science

We measured evapotranspiration (ET) and surface energy fluxes over the riparian shrub Myricaria squamosa Desv., which is widely distributed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau but has not been studied until now. The results indicated that annual ET was 390 mm and 503 mm for the period of 2010 to 2011 and 2011 to 2012, respectively, which was higher than the amount of precipitation during the same period. Cumulative ET was lower than the cumulative reference evapotranspiration during the entire experimental period, whereas ET in August was higher than reference evapotranspiration. ET in the growing season occupied over 80% of annual ET with a maximum daily ET of 7.2 mm d(-1), and the ET in the non-growing season was quite low because of the frozen soil. In general, temperature and net radiation were the key variables controlling daily ET rates for M. squamosa. Annual sensible heat flux (H) consumed 60% of net radiation (R-n) and latent heat flux (LE) 40% during the three years of the study. LE occupied the main part of R-n from July to September. H was the highest in May and June, then sunk in the mid-growing season, and rebounded the other peak at late September and early October. Daily ground heat flux was positive from April to mid-September, and it was an important heat source of land surface in the winter and spring. This study highlighted that as an alpine riparian ecosystem in a semiarid region, ET and surface energy partitioning of the M. squamosa community are strongly affected by the freeze-thaw cycle, groundwater fluctuation, precipitation pulses and soil water content. We speculate that climate warming has a significant impact on ET process and surface energy partitioning of the M. squamosa community by influencing the freeze-thaw cycle and soil water content.

J,"Missaghi, S; Hondzo, M",,,,"Missaghi, Shahram; Hondzo, Miki",,,Evaluation and application of a three-dimensional water quality model in a shallow lake with complex morphometry,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fundamental hydrodynamic and ecological processes of a lake or reservoir could be adequately depicted by one-dimensional (1D) numerical simulation models. Whereas, lakes with significant horizontal water quality and hydrodynamic gradients due to their complex morphometry, inflow or water level fluctuations require a three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics and ecological analyses to accurately simulate their temporal and spatial dynamics. In this study, we applied a 3D hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) coupled with an ecological model (CAEDYM) to simulate water quality parameters in three bays of the morphologically complex Lake Minnetonka. A considerable effort was made in setting up the model and a systematic parameterization approach was adopted to estimate the value of parameters based on their published values. Model calibration covered the entire length of the simulation periods from March 29 to October 20, 2000. Sensitivity analysis identified the top parameters with the largest contributions to the sensitivity of model results. The model was next verified with the same setup and parameter values for the period of April 25 to October 10, 2005 against field data. Spatial and temporal dynamics were well simulated and model output results of water temperature (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP) and one group of algae (Cyanobacteria) represented as chlorophyll a (Chla) compared well with an extensive field data in the bays. The results show that the use of the model along with an accurate bathymetry, a systematic calibration and corroboration (verification) process will help to analyze the hydrodynamics and geochemical processes of the morphologically complex lake Minnetonka. An example of an ecological application of the model for Lake Minnetonka is presented by examining the effect of spatial heterogeneity on coolwater fish habitat analysis in 3D and under a scenario where horizontal spatial heterogeneity was eliminated (1D). Both analyses captured seasonal fish habitat changes and the total seasonal averages differed moderately. However, the 1D analysis did not capture local and short duration variabilities and missed suitable fish habitat variations of as much as 20%. The experiment highlighted the need for a 3D analysis in depicting ecological hot spots such as unsuitable fish habitats in Lake Minnetonka.

A.",,,Basic Regularities of Vertical Turbulent Exchange in the Mixed and Stratified Layers of the Black Sea,PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose. The purpose of the study is to assess the coefficient of vertical turbulent exchange for different layers of the Black Sea basin based on the experimental data on microstructure of the physical fields obtained for the period 2004-2019 in the Black Sea and using the semi-empirical models. Methods and Results. For the upper mixed layer, the turbulent energy dissipation rate c and the exchange coefficient were calculated using the velocity fluctuation spectra based on the Kolmogorov hypotheses on the turbulence spectrum inertial range. In the stratified layers, the turbulence coefficient and the dissipation rate were experimentally determined both from the spectra of the velocity horizontal fluctuations' gradients and the vertical spectra of temperature fluctuations using the concept of the effective scale of turbulent patches. Depending on the features of the hydrological regime and the prevailing energy contributors to turbulence generation, five layers were identified and described (including their characteristic power dependences of the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficients K on the buoyancy frequency N) using the 1.5D-model of vertical turbulent exchange for the basin under study. For the stratified layers, the 1.5D-model results were comparatively analyzed with those of the other semi-empirical and theoretical models describing the most probable hydrophysical processes in each specific layer; the relations for the vertical turbulent exchange coefficient were obtained depending on the buoyancy frequency. Conclusions. Comparison of the experimental data collected under different hydrometeorological conditions with the simulations resulted from the known turbulence models for the sea upper layer showed that the best agreement between the simulation and measurement data was provided by a multiscale model taking into account three basic mechanisms of turbulence generation: current velocity shear, instability of wave motions, and wave breaking. The turbulent exchange coefficient dependencies on depth are conditioned by the effect of the turbulence dominant source at a given level. In the stratified layers, the exchange coefficient dependence on buoyancy frequency is determined by the hydrophysical processes in each layer; the relations obtained for individual layers indicate intensity of the contributions of vertical advection, internal wave breakings, turbulence diffusion and geothermal flux.",,,,,"Kazakov, Dmitrii Anatolevich/ABB-9621-2021","Kazakov, Dmitrii Anatolevich/0000-0001-5083-4968",,,,,,,,,,,,,0928-5105,1573-160X,,,,,2021,28,4,,,,,376,391,,10.22449/1573-160X-2021-4-376-391,http://dx.doi.org/10.22449/1573-160X-2021-4-376-391,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000691863900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

S.; dos Santos, Alexandre R.; da Cruz, Jovane P.; Leite, Helio G.",,,GIS-based approach applied to optimizing recommendations of Eucalyptus genotypes,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"The study of the genotype x environment interaction is a prominent issue, requiring care for recommending improved superior genotypes to certain areas. Experimentally, it is possible to infer that the puzzle of genotype recommendations relies on edaphic and climatic changes over different terrain latitudes and longitudes, and further fluctuates in microenvironments as a result of site variations. Different gene expression is activated or suppressed in accordance with environmental requirements, resulting in phenotypic plasticity of cultivars. The goal of this study was to generate an optimal recommendation of eucalyptus genotypes in a 6846.0 km(2) using climatic and geographical information. For this purpose, we used 24 clones unevenly distributed in 988 plots over the area, with planting ages between 2.5 and 6.5 years. The evaluated trait was production, measured in cubic meters of wood per hectare. Our study area typically has a mid-to-low altitude range (0-390 m), rainfall between 599 and 1749 mm, temperature from 22 to 25 degrees C, and a series of other bioclimatic variables. For statistical analysis, we used the random regression via mixed-effects models (REML/BLUP) combined with logistic growth models. Among the total number of clones, six proved to be the most suitable to maximize volumetric production in the work area. In addition, a change in the recommendation was verified for clones between 2.5 and 6.5 years of age. This study presents an alternate concept of environmental stratification, which to date has been made categorically by evaluating a number of locations. Our study proposes a way to perform quantitative stratum over an entire area, according to the environmental gradient. The optimal selection of genotypes promotes increased wood production without necessarily increasing the planting area, which is extremely desirable because land is a resource that is becoming increasingly scarce. Furthermore, eucalyptus productivity represents an important part of the costs and revenues of the forest enterprise, such that minimal improvements can significantly affect profit margins. The proposed method is easily adapted for use for other crops and domestic animal production. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Fish may experience periods of food deprivation or starvation in nature and under culture conditions. Because of the wild stock reduction of some sturgeon species, Siberian sturgeon, Acipenser baerii Brandt, 1869, has been used as a biological model of physiological and nutritional studies since the 1980s. There are no published records on the physiological responses of Siberian sturgeon to starvation. Hence, in this study the effect of short-term starvation (0, 2, 4, and 8 days) on plasma thyroid hormones (T-3 and T-4), total protein levels, and hepato-somatic-(HSI), viscero-somatic-(VSI), and digestive-somatic (DSI) indices in juvenile Siberian sturgeon was investigated. Materials and methods. The experiment was conducted at the International Sturgeon Research Institute of Rasht (Iran) in October 2009, using a semi-natural environment (natural photoperiod and natural water temperature fluctuations). After a period of adaptation (10 days on a formulated diet), 180 juvenile Siberian sturgeon individuals (mean weight +/- standard error at start of experiment: 19.32 +/- 0.43, n = 15) were randomly distributed among twelve circular, 500-L, fibreglass tanks with a flow-through system. In this trial, control (C) was fed a formulated diet to apparent satiation four times daily throughout the experiment. The other three groups were deprived of feed for 2- (2S), 4- (4S), and 8 (8S) days, respectively. At the end of the starvation periods, blood samples were collected to analyze biochemical and physiological parameters. Results. Plasma T-3, T-4, and total protein levels did not significantly vary between the fed and the starved fish. In comparison to the starved groups, after 8 days of starvation, plasma total protein in group 8S (3.43 +/- 0.20) was markedly higher than in 2S (2.67 +/- 0.07) and 4S (2.37 +/- 0.12) groups. In the presently reported study, a decrease in the measured morphometric indices was observed with an increase in the length of the starvation period. Conclusion. The results suggest that Siberian sturgeon has metabolic adjustment ability to short periods of starvation due to reduced basal metabolism rate and energy reserves utilization during starvation.",,,,,"Morshedi, Vahid/H-1642-2018; Yavari, Vahid/AAC-7829-2019","Morshedi, Vahid/0000-0001-7673-2652; Yavari, Vahid/0000-0002-0882-9759; (KMSU), khorramshahr university of marine Science and technology/0000-0001-8329-9690",,,,,,,,,,,,,0137-1592,,,,,,2013,43,2,,,,,145,150,,10.3750/AIP2013.43.2.07,http://dx.doi.org/10.3750/AIP2013.43.2.07,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000322313900007,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Fincke, OM",,,,"Fincke, OM",,,Organization of predator assemblages in Neotropical tree holes: effects of abiotic factors and priority,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Water-filled tree holes in a lowland forest in Panama harbour an assemblage of large predators consisting of the larvae of five common species of Odonata, the mosquito Toxorhynchites theobaldi, and tadpoles of Dendrobates auratus. Odonate females oviposit in both large and small tree holes. However, the three largest species emerge from larger tree holes, on average, than do the two smallest species. Can assembly rules explain this and other patterns of predator distribution? 2. Past experiments suggested that fast growth of the largest, but later-colonizing odonates enabled them to out-compete the smaller, slower-growing Mecistogaster in large holes. In small holes, however, the first predator, regardless of species, should presumably kill any later arrivals. Priority effects in small holes were tested for their consistency across predator species. Two alternative explanations for differential odonate survivorship were also tested: abiotic conditions and the effect of non-odonate predators. 3. Diurnal fluctuations in oxygen content, pH, and temperature within holes were as great as the variation found between large and small tree holes; abiotic conditions were poor predictors of species occupancy. 4. Exchanging the largest and smallest odonate species from their original holes did not affect survivorship, suggesting that the observed patterns of emergence are unlikely to result from differential tolerance to abiotic factors that were not measured. 5. When larger and smaller predators were paired in 400-ml pots and provided with alternative prey, typically only the larger predator survived, regardless of species. The exception was T. theobaldi, which was often killed by odonates and tadpoles smaller than itself. 6. Between May and July, the occurrence of Mecistogaster in large tree holes declined, before larvae could have emerged. Neither abiotic effects nor differential predation by non-odonates could explain this habitat-specific decrease in survivorship. This temporal pattern is most consistent with the previous conclusion that in large holes, Mecistogaster suffer intraguild predation from later-colonizing, but faster-growing Megaloprepus and aeshnids. Whereas Mecistogaster can pre-empt guild members from small tree holes, they cannot do so in large holes where predators with fast initial growth realize a competitive advantage.",,,,,"Fincke, Ola/W-2810-2019","Fincke, Ola/0000-0002-4456-0136",,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,,,,,FEB,1999,24,1,,,,,13,23,,10.1046/j.1365-2311.1999.00166.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2311.1999.00166.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000078884500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used laboratory and polytunnel experiments to investigate a novel control system based on autodissemination of spores of an entomopathogenic fungus to populations of adult vine weevils. The fungus was applied as a conidial powder, used on its own or formulated with talc, to a simple plastic refuge for vine weevils. The potential for adult weevils to disseminate the fungus was investigated first in polytunnel experiments using fluorescent powders applied to the refuge in lieu of fungal conidia. In this system, 88% of adult weevils came in contact with the powder within 48 h. When the powder was applied to five adult weevils that were then placed within a population of 35 potential recipients, it was transmitted on average to 75% of the recipient population within 7 days. Three isolates of entomopathogenic fungi (Beauveria bassiana isolate codes 433.99 and 1749.11 and Metarhizium brunneum isolate code 275.86), selected from a laboratory virulence screen. These three isolates were then investigated for efficacy when applied as conidial powders in artificial refuges placed among populations of adult weevils held in experimental boxes in the laboratory at 20 degrees C. Under this regime, the fungal isolates caused 70-90% mortality of adult weevils over 28 days. A final polytunnel experiment tested the efficacy of conidial powders of M. brunneum 275.86 placed in artificial refuges to increase vine weevil mortality. Overall weevil mortality was relatively low (26-41%) but was significantly higher in cages in which the conidial powders were placed in refuge traps than in cages with control traps. The lower weevil mortality recorded in the polytunnel experiment compared to the laboratory test was most likely a consequence of the greater amounts of inoculum required to kill adult weevils when conditions fluctuate between favourable and unfavourable temperatures e.g. below 15 degrees C. The potential of an autodissemination system for entomopathogenic fungi as a means of controlling vine weevil as part of an integrated pest management programme is discussed.",,,,,"Pope, Tom/AAJ-5573-2021","Pope, Tom/0000-0002-3678-2943; Hough, Gemma/0000-0001-8304-2043",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2011,1096-0805,,,,MAY,2018,154,,,,,,79,84,,10.1016/j.jip.2018.04.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2018.04.002,,,,,,,,29655593,,,,,WOS:000434907500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is therefore critical to understand the factors that shape microbiome taxonomic composition and function. Little is known about the stability of coral microbiomes over hourly fluctuations in environmental conditions. For parameters such as temperature and pH, the magnitude of day-night fluctuations can exceed those observed in mean values over seasons, especially on shallow reefs. Such short-term heterogeneity can affect longer term trends, possibly by influencing the extent to which corals acclimate to stress and increase resilience. This study examined diel dynamics of microbiomes (Bacteria and Archaea) in three species of stony coral (Porites lutea, Porites cylindrica, and Pocillopora damicornis) from a shallow reef in Mo'orea (French Polynesia). We assessed microbiome composition and relative transcriptional activity by analyzing 16S rRNA gene and transcript sequences from six timepoints over 48 h for each species. Both the composition and transcription of microbiome members changed significantly over the diel cycle. Most changes did not exhibit clear diel periodicity but were instead stochastic, a pattern potentially influenced also by microspatial variation within a coral colony. However, a subset of taxa, notably the dinoflagellate-associated bacterium Porticoccus and bacteria of the ubiquitous coral-associated Endozoicomonas genus, exhibited cyclic changes in relative frequency over the 2 d sampling period in the DNA dataset of Porites lutea. These patterns raise the possibility that ecological functions of the microbiome may vary substantially over hourly timescales, notably between day and night. Further studies are needed to compare temporal change in the coral microbiome with that due to other factors, such as spatial distance within and among colonies.",,,,,"Caughman, Alicia/GYU-4733-2022","Caughman, Alicia/0000-0001-6714-9967",,,,,,,,,,,,,0722-4028,1432-0975,,,,JUN,2021,40,3,,,,,921,935,,10.1007/s00338-021-02097-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-021-02097-8,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000641202500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Forest decline phenomena relate extreme droughts or heat waves with other organisms, e.g., insects or microorganisms acting as pests, but their role needs to be elucidated. A biotic factor responsible for forest diseases is Candidatus Phytoplasma pini which is a phloem-parasitism that negatively affects Spanish pine forests in drought-prone areas. In several healthy and declining Aleppo pine stands, we monitored pine infection by PCR (Polimerase Chain Reation), determined the tree phloem tissue terpene composition, carbohydrate content, measured several relevant morpho-physiological variables and examined trees affected by bark beetles. PCR confirmed C. P. pini infection was widespread in all stands, regardless of to the presence of symptomatically affected trees. However, visible symptomatic decline only occurred in trees living under more stressful conditions. The terpene composition of pines in declining stands differed from those in healthy ones, and could be related with bark beetle attacks when pines were previously weakened by the phytoplasma disease. Our results indicate that biotic factors, such as C.

Among numerous designated characteristics, tolerance towards environmental stress is one of the most favored. However, there is little empirical support for the assumption that non-native species generally cope better with temporarily unfavorable conditions than native species. To test this concept, we ran five pairwise comparisons between native and non-native marine invertebrates at temperate, subtropical, and tropical sites. We included (natives named first) six bivalves: Brachidontes exustus and Perna viridis, P. perm and Isognomon bicolor. Saccostrea glomerata and Crassostrea gigas, two ascidians: Diplosoma listerianum and Didemnum vexillum as well as two crustaceans: Gammarus zaddachi and G. tigrinus. We simulated acute fluctuations in salinity, oxygen concentration, and temperature, while we measured respiration and survival rates. Under stressful conditions, non-native species consistently showed less pronounced deviations from their normal respiratory performance than their native counterparts. We suggest that this indicates that they have a wider tolerance range. Furthermore, they also revealed higher survival rates under stress. Thus, stress tolerance seems to be a property of successful invaders and could therefore be a useful criterion for screening profiles and risk assessment protocols. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Mite numbers increased rapidly over the summer of 1992-1993 when fed on vetch, Vicia sativa cv Blanchefleur; in contrast mite numbers were low and fell over the second half of the summer of 1990-91 when fed on subterranean clover, Trifolium subterraneum cv Junee.

The mean transfer time was 35 days and using the interval between transfers as a measure of generation time, the mites completed six to seven generations with no evidence for development of diapause eggs from August until April. There was considerable variability in the numbers of mites produced per pot, associated in part with the presence of Verticillium sp. fungus in 35% of the pots during transfers. Improvement in H. destructor rearing resulted from the use of V. sativa cv Blanchefleur as a food source, maintenance of high humidity and adequate ventilation within cages, and the transfer of mites to fresh food sources at early nymphal stages, which reduced the spread of fungal infections.",,,,,"Ridsdill-Smith, James/C-2115-2008","Ridsdill-Smith, James/0000-0003-0660-1934",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-8162,,,,,JUN,1995,19,6,,,,,337,345,,10.1007/BF00052391,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00052391,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995TG08500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This will be aided by better understanding of natural variance in photosynthesis. Profiling of Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC) metabolites provides a top-down strategy to uncover interspecies diversity in CBC operation. In a study of four C-4 and five C-3 species, principal components analysis separated C-4 species from C-3 species and also separated different C-4 species. These separations were driven by metabolites that reflect known species differences in their biochemistry and pathways. Unexpectedly, there was also considerable diversity between the C-3 species. Falling atmospheric CO2 and changing temperature, nitrogen, and water availability have driven evolution of C-4 photosynthesis in multiple lineages. We propose that analogous selective pressures drove lineage-dependent evolution of the CBC in C-3 species. Examples of species-dependent variation include differences in the balance between the CBC and the light reactions, and in the balance between regulated steps in the CBC. Metabolite profiles also reveal conserved features including inactivation of enzymes in low irradiance, and maintenance of CBC metabolites at relatively high levels in the absence of net CO2 fixation. These features may be important for photosynthetic efficiency in low light, fluctuating irradiance, and when stomata close due to low water availability.",,,,,"Stitt, Mark/GVT-1242-2022","Borghi, Gian Luca/0000-0002-6933-2615; Stitt, Mark/0000-0002-4900-1763",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,SEP 2,2021,72,17,,,SI,,5961,5986,,10.1093/jxb/erab291,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erab291,,JUN 2021,,,,,,34473300,,,,,WOS:000695817500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

There was no difference between species in reproductive effort per brood, but they differed in investment strategy. Gambusia affinis females produced large broods with small embryos, whereas G. nobilis females produced broods of fewer, larger embryos.

Calcium-assisted cell wall-bound mannan-binding proteins were found to be involved in this flocculation, which was unaffected by wide fluctuation of pH or temperatures revealing its constitutive robust nature. Expression of few flocculation related Flo genes was up-regulated in these cells. Interestingly, there was significant increase in ethanol production by the yeast expressing AtMed15.

Results from a pilot study are presented for eight days during July, September, October and November 1994. Total energy gains were dominated by net short-wave radiation (97.60%) with significant contributions from sensible heat exchange and friction (1.17 and 1.06%, respectively) and minor additions from condensation and bed conduction (0.16 and 0.01%, respectively). Net long-wave radiation, evaporation, conduction into the river bed, sensible heat transfer and the energy advected during evaporation accounted for 53.98, 23.56, 16.27, 5.25 and 0.94% of the total heat losses. On average, over 82% of the total energy transfers occurred at the air-water interface. Approximately 15% of the total energy exchanges occurred at the channel bed, but maximum daily heat exchanges accounted for up to 24% of the daily total energy transfer. The amount of short-wave radiation attenuated in the water column, and values measured at the channel bed varied considerably from those calculated using a standard coefficient. Values of bed conduction varied in response to different vertical thermal profiles in the channel bed, reflecting the variable influence of sedimentology and groundwater flux. Fluctuations in levels of periphyton and macrophyte cover were also shown to have a significant effect on energy fluxes at the channel bed.

Each treatment had triplicate groups of 35 animals. During the experimental period, the scallops were fed with Spirulina maxima, and water temperature ranged from 15.2 degrees C to 17.5 degrees C, salinity from 29.5 parts per thousand to 32.5 parts per thousand and pH from 7.5 to 8.2. Survival, specific growth rate (SGR) and total haemocyte count (THC) were examined at the end of the study, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), were examined at 12 h, 24 h, Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21 after being exposed to the graded DO levels. The lower DO levels (2.5 and 4.5 mg l(-1)) resulted in lower survivals of scallops, and the survival (81.7%) at 2.5 mg l(-1) DO was significantly lower than those (100.0%) at 8.5 and 6.5 mg l(-1) DO. Similarly, the SGR and THC of scallop gradually reduced with decreasing DO levels, and reached significant levels at 2.5 mg l(-1) DO (P < 0.05). At higher DO levels (8.5 and 6.5 mg l(-1)), the SOD activity maintained rather stable during the entire sampling period. At lower DO levels (4.5 and 2.5 mg l(-1)), however, the SOD activity significantly increased at 12 h, and then significantly decreased to the levels below the normal. At the two lower DO levels, ACP activities had no significant changes before Day 7, and then declined to the levels that were significantly lower than the normal. Significantly higher ALP activity was only observed at 12 h in the treatment of 2.5 mg l(-1) DO, but in all other treatments and sampling times it fluctuated in a narrow range.

Two plum cultivars: European plum 'Viktorija' (P. domestica L.) and hybrid plum 'Kubanskaja Kometa' (P. x rossica Erem.) grafted on 8 vegetatively propagated rootstocks ('St. Julien A', 'Brompton., 'Ackermann', 'Pixy', 'GF8/1', 'G5/2', 'GF655/2', 'Hamyra') and 8 generatively propagated rootstocks ('St. Julien INRA2', 'St. Julien d' Orleans', 'St. Julien Noir', 'Brompton', 'Wangenheims Zwetsche', 'St. Julien Wadenswill', 'Myrobalan', P. cerasifera var. divaricate) were used in the investigation. Plums were planted at the distance of 5 x 3 m with three plants per plot. The evaluation was done from 2008 to 2013. The following characteristics were evaluated: winter hardiness of flower buds; flowering intensity in the laboratory (during the winter time) and on the field (in spring) in points from 1 to 5, where 1 - no flowering observed, 5 - very high flowering intensity; yield; the overall status of a tree after wintering period (in points from 1 to 5, where 1 - a tree in a very bad condition, 5 - a tree in an excellent condition).

It is caused by a complex of Pythium species, but the species diversity and interactions within the complex have never been studied for modelling CCS epidemics. The diversity of a pathogenic Pythium community was assessed during 3 consecutive years in a field experiment after an initial artificial soil infestation with P. violae. 1241 lesions were examined, yielding 728 Pythium isolates. Conventional microbiological methods and restriction polymorphism of the internal transcribed spacer regions of the rDNA of 209 representative Pythium isolates allowed us to identify 655 isolates as belonging to six Pythium species, including P. violae and five indigenous species (P. sulcatum, P. intermedium, P. sylvaticuinlirregulare, P. coloratum, and P. ulthnum). Biological traits, such as pathogenicity, optimum temperature for mycelial growth and saprophytic survival of the inoculum, explained the fluctuations in the composition of the complex over 17 successive samplings during the 3-year period, most notably the prevalence of first P. violae and then P. sulcatum. P. violae and P. sulcatum were occasionally isolated in mixture from single lesions (10.4% and 9.6%, respectively). Other species were more frequently isolated in mixture: 30.8% for P. interniedium, 33.8% for P. sylvaticum/irregulare, 42.9% for P. ultinium, and 66.7% for P. coloratum. A contingency analysis allowed us to define 'major' and 'minor' species on both pathological and ecological criteria (frequency of occurrence in the complex, pathogenicity and ability to induce lesions by themselves), and demonstrated that infection by one 'major' pathogen species (P. violae or P. sulcatum) is not positively correlated with the presence of a second Pythium species. The ratio between 'observed' and 'expected' mixed infection frequency under the assumption of independent infection (mir) was less than l for P. violae, P. sulcatum, P. intermeditan, and P. ylvaticunll irregulare (P < 0.05). For all Pythium species, there was a negative linear relationship between mir and pathogenicity (R-2 = 0.638): the less a Pythium species was pathogenic on carrot, the more often it was isolated from a CCS lesion in mixture with at least one other species. The non- significance of interactions between species during the infection phase suggests that CCS epidemics can be analysed as if they were caused by a single Pythium species. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In actual practice, recommendations of nutrient dosage are based on long-range predictions (whole cultivation period) of water and N demand, as well as from optimum constant N concentrations in nutrient solution or substrate. Short-term fluctuation of temperature and radiation conditions that affect plant growth rates, as well as nutrient and water uptake rates within individual growing periods, are not considered. In the future, models fluctuating greenhouse conditions will be necessary for improved N-use efficiency. In this study, N uptake of cut chrysanthemums (Dendranthema Grandiflorum Hybrids) cv. 'Puma white' were obtained in a soilless commercial-style cultivation system with planting at four dates (5. 11. 91; 25. 3. 92; 4. 1. 93; 1. 7. 93). In all experiments, shoots were harvested every 14 days from planting until flowering, with dry matter, internal N concentration, and shoot height being measured. In the soilless cultivation system, dry matter concentrations of N (4 to 3 %) remained constant over the whole growing period with r < - 0.20, indicating non-limiting nitrogen supply. For each planting date, N uptake (y) was closely (r(2) = 0.94; 0.93; 0.84; 0.93, respectively) related to shoot height (x) at the time of cutting and could be characterized by the equation y = a*x(b), where a and b are empirical regression coefficients. In agreement with constant internal N concentrations, N uptake (0 to 800 mg N* plant(-1)) was linearly related to dry matter accumulation (0 to 20 g* plant(-1)) with coefficients of determination ranging from .94 to 0.99. Therefore, typical S-shaped curves of nitrogen uptake could not be reproduced in these experiments. Canopy dry matter was correlated to canopy shoot height (r values ranging from 0.92 to 0.97), reflecting constant shoot densities (64 m(-2)) during the entire growing period in this type of cut flower canopy. The results allow a distinct simplification of regression models of N uptake in that shoot height instead of dry matter or plant age could be used as the independent variable.

However, long-term averages can conceal climate changes that have occurred in recent decades and may not capture actual species occurrence well because the distributions of species, especially at the edges of their range, are typically dynamic and may respond strongly to short-term climate variability. Our goal here was to test whether bird occurrence models can be predicted by either covariates based on short-term climate variability or on long-term climate averages. We parameterized species distribution models (SDMs) based on either short-term variability or long-term average climate covariates for 320 bird species in the conterminous USA and tested whether any life-history trait-based guilds were particularly sensitive to short-term conditions. Models including short-term climate variability performed well based on their cross-validated area-under-the-curve AUC score (0.85), as did models based on long-term climate averages (0.84). Similarly, both models performed well compared to independent presence/absence data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (independent AUC of 0.89 and 0.90, respectively). However, models based on short-term variability covariates more accurately classified true absences for most species (73% of true absences classified within the lowest quarter of environmental suitability vs. 68%). In addition, they have the advantage that they can reveal the dynamic relationship between species and their environment because they capture the spatial fluctuations of species potential breeding distributions. With this information, we can identify which species and guilds are sensitive to climate variability, identify sites of high conservation value where climate variability is low, and assess how species' potential distributions may have already shifted due recent climate change. However, long-term climate averages require less data and processing time and may be more readily available for some areas of interest. Where data on short-term climate variability are not available, long-term climate information is a sufficient predictor of species distributions in many cases. However, short-term climate variability data may provide information not captured with long-term climate data for use in SDMs.",,,,,"Akcakaya, H.

C.; Gabina, G.; Mendiola, D.",,,Integration of energy audits in the Life Cycle Assessment methodology to improve the environmental performance assessment of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"In Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), water is continuously treated and recirculated as opposed to being discharged untreated into the environment as in other type of fish production systems; the design and production parameters will determine the overall energy consumption. This energy-intensive nature hampers their sustainability and cost-effectiveness. This paper proposes a combination of two methods (i.e. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with energy audits) to: improve environmental performance of RAS, identify energy consumption and thus, its environmental and monetary effects in order to seek cost reduction. The proposed methodology was proved with a case study focused in a pilot-scale RAS unit used in codfish (Gadus morhua) production, located in the Basque coastal area (northern Spain). Feed and juvenile production transportation, oxygen transportation and energy consumed during the whole experiment were considered as inputs for the assessment. Energy consumption was measured both continuously by an energy meter embedded in the RAE unit as well as with a portable energy analyzer to measure each of the energy-consuming devices independently. Although the system required an average of 29.40 kWh/kg fish for successful system operation, the energy consumption varied by season presenting maximum and minimum periods of 40.57 and 18.43 kWh/kg fish, respectively. Main consumers included the heat pump, followed by the main and secondary pumps, respectively. Energy audit's results show the success in identifying the devices that consumed the largest amount of energy, and recorded data served to feed the Life Cycle Inventory and perform a more complete and precise LCA. Fossil fuel based on-farm electricity for the on-growing of fish was shown to be the most environmentally unfriendly input; it was the major impact producer in the assessed impact categories. It showed a temporal variability depending on the water temperature, which resulted to be the main factor linked to the energy use. This aided performing a precise assessment including system-specific scenarios. The combination of LCA and on-farm energy audit represents a useful tool to secure a more complete assessment with a periodic assessment to design a less energy intensive, profitable and sustainable system; likewise, it increases the speed and transparency of governance and decision-making, taking into account the time-based fluctuation of the energy consumption throughout the production cycle.

J,"Schlosser, IJ",,,,"Schlosser, IJ",,,"Fish recruitment, dispersal, and trophic interactions in a heterogeneous lotic environment",OECOLOGIA,,,,,,,,,,,,"I examine how dispersal of juvenile creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus) from beaver ponds into adjacent stream environments interacts with temporal abiotic variability to influence fish foraging, growth, and long-term persistence in the lotic ecosystem. Minnow trapping in upstream and downstream beaver ponds, along with weir traps used to monitor directional movement, indicated that most chubs colonized the stream from the downstream beaver pond. Large annual fluctuations in density of age 0 creek chubs occurred in the stream over a 10-year sampling period. Multiple regression analysis indicated that stream temperature, precipitation, and the density of reproductive creek chubs were not correlated with summer density of age 0 chubs in the stream. The factor most strongly associated with increased density of age 0 creek chubs was creation of the downstream beaver pond during the 6th-7th years of the study, suggesting dispersal from the pond was the primary factor determining age 0 fish density in the stream. Most individuals in the strong year classes neither persisted in the stream through their first winter nor resulted in an increased abundance of older age classes in later years. Comparison of age 0 fish density in summer to the proportion of fish surviving to age 1 in spring suggested that overwinter mortality was density dependent. Furthermore, a comparison of the size structure for age 0 individuals in summer to age 1 individuals the following spring indicated that winter mortality was size dependent. Experiments in an artificial stream adjacent to the natural channel revealed that fish growth was strongly density dependent, decreasing as fish density increased across both spring and summer, and elevated and low discharge. The decline in invertebrate prey captured by the fish and the subsequent decline in fish growth appeared to be particularly pronounced under low discharge in summer. Changes in juvenile creek chub density had no significant effect on benthic insect or crustacean abundance, suggesting that exploitative competition for limited invertebrate drift resources was a more important cause of density-dependent growth than depressed local benthic invertebrate abundance. These results suggest that lotic regions adjacent to beaver ponds act as potential reproductive sinks for dispersing juveniles confronting seasonal and flow-mediated restrictions on resource acquisition and growth, and the occurrence of seasonal bottlenecks to their survival, especially harsh winter conditions.",,,,,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,JAN,1998,113,2,,,,,260,268,,10.1007/s004420050377,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050377,,,,,,,,28308206,,,,,WOS:000071658500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Root-mean-square (rms) differences between subsurface pressures (SSP) measured by altimetry and bottom pressures (BP) measured by in situ devices are approximately 2 mbar in the northern DP and 4 mbar in the south, after application of a 20-day low-pass filter. Two mbar accuracy would suggest that altimetry could be capable of providing useful additional information on Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport fluctuations through the DP on seasonal and interannual timescales. The larger rms differences on what is considered to be the more important southern side are explainable in terms of baroclinic variability at the southern end of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) SR1 section. The first WOCE conductivity-temperature-depth data sets from SR1 have confirmed the existence of a major baroclinic ''eddy feature'' in the south, which could account to a great extent for the larger rms values. Better southern DP locations could possibly have been chosen for WOCE. However, further recent in situ measurements from other locations near to the DP have shown that the southern DP ACC-related signals in SSP or BP are only slightly larger than T/P accuracy, which suggests that, as yet, they cannot be adequately monitored by means of altimetry alone, whichever location is chosen. Even if the altimetric and in situ observations were perfect, would they provide information directly relatable to transport variability through the passage? Tl-iis question has been studied by means of Fine-Resolution Antarctic Model (FRAM) numerical modeling investigations which have demonstrated the complexity of the correlation between the variability in DP transport and SSP (or sea level). Within FRAM, northern SSP (or BP) variations are virtually uncorrelated with transport fluctuations, and the modelling has confirmed the importance of southern measurements, as inferred from in situ measurements over a decade ago. It is evident that, for the foreseeable future, an extensive set of in situ instrumentation will be required, in addition to the altimetry, if further insight into circulation in this part of the Southern Ocean is to be obtained.",,,,,"Hughes, Chris/GQP-7479-2022; Hughes, Chris W/A-3791-2010","Hughes, Chris W/0000-0002-9355-0233; Meredith, Michael/0000-0002-7342-7756; Woodworth, Philip/0000-0002-6681-239X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,MAY 15,1996,101,C5,,,,,11935,11947,,10.1029/96JC00350,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/96JC00350,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UL25800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

An experiment of 30 days was carried out on broodstock (average body length 28.4 +/- 0.95 cm, average body weight 96.7 +/- 6.48 g) with (treatment) or without eyestalk ablation (control), cultivated under a water temperature of 27.0 +/- 1.5 degrees C, salinity of 30-32, pH of 8.0-8.3, and light intensity of 1000 lx. Results showed that food consumption and feeding intensity of the eyestalk-ablated broodstock were higher than those without eyestalk ablation. The nighttime feeding intensity was 1.46-fold and 1.31-fold higher than the daytime feeding intensity in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P<0.01). Food consumption in the treatment group increased continuously during sexual maturation acceleration, whereas that of the control group fluctuated. At the end of the experiment, the gonadosomatic index (GSI) increased by 607.14% and 100.00% in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P<0.01). The gonadal wet and dry mass ratio (G(d)/m) was higher in the treatment group than those in the control group, but the difference was not significant (P>0.05). Furthermore, the body energy values (E-b) slightly decreased in both groups. The increase in the gonad energy value (E-g) was significantly higher in the treatment than control group (P<0.01). Thus, the broodstock showed negative growth in their breeding season from the perspective of body energy value. During the experimental period, food conversion efficiency (FCE) and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) values of the treatment group were significantly higher than those of the control, with FCE values of 11.06% and 1.89%, respectively, and ECE values of 15.45% and 2.64%, respectively. These results indicated that eyestalk ablation promoted food consumption, feeding intensity, gonad development, and energy conversion efficiency of P. monodon broodstock. During gonad development, food was the chief, though not the only, source of energy, with tissues and organs also important energy suppliers.

Seven practical diets were formulated to contain 0.1, 12.2, 23.8, 47.6, 89.7, 188.5 and 489.0 mg ascorbic acid equivalent kg(-1) diet, supplied as L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (LAPP). Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of fish in seawater floating cages (1.5 x 1.5 x 2.0 m), and each cage was stocked with 120 fish. Fish were fed twice daily (05:00 and 17:00) to apparent satiation for 8 weeks. The water temperature fluctuated from 19.5 to 25.5 degrees C, the salinity from 25 to 28 parts per thousand and dissolved oxygen content was approximately 7 mg l(-1) during the experimental period. Results showed that the specific growth rate (SGR) (from 1.80 to 1.96% d(-1)) had an increasing trend with the increase of dietary vitamin C, but no significant difference was observed among dietary treatments. No gross deficiency signs were observed in any of the experimental fish. Survival rate, however, significantly increased with increasing dietary vitamin C (P < 0.05). The vitamin C contents in liver and muscle correlated positively with the vitamin C in diets. The vitamin C requirement was estimated to be 28.2 mg kg(-1) based on survival, and 87.0 mg kg(-1) on liver content of vitamin C. The activities of serum lysozyme and alternative complement pathway (ACP), phagocytosis percentage (PP) and respiratory burst activity of head kidney significantly increased with increasing dietary vitamin C. The challenge experiment with Vibrio harveyi showed that fish fed the diets with supplementation of vitamin C had significantly lower cumulative mortality compared to the control group (66.7%), and the cumulative mortality (16.7%) in fish with 489.0 mg kg(-1) ascorbic acid was significantly lower than that (41.7%) in fish with 23.8 mg kg(-1) ascorbic acid. These results suggested that vitamin C significantly influenced the immune response and disease resistance of large yellow croaker. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, given the ever increasing interest in reducing the energy consumption of buildings, there is likewise a concerted effort to improve the performance of glazing units. The most common insulated glass glazing systems are double-glazed insulated glass units (IGUs) that consist of two glass panes and a rim seal. The quality of the rim seal generally defines the service life of the double-glazed IGU because the seals prevent moisture from penetrating the gaseous cavity of the IGU. It is sometimes reported in Japan that after construction some double-glazed IGUs installed in a building form haze in the IGU cavity due to condensation. Window frames generally protect rim seals from factors causing aging of IGUs, e.g., elevated temperatures, high levels of humidity, and ultraviolet radiation. Wind pressure acting on the IGU can cause the panes to move, however, and these movements can be a major aging factor for rim seals. In this paper a study is described in which a fundamental test method is employed to evaluate the fatigue of IGU rim seals arising from wind pressure acting on the IGU. A two-way fatigue test is proposed that takes wind profiles into account. A 2-m-high double-glazed IGU incorporating a conventional rim seal was subjected to a fatigue test of approximately 350 cycles; the test replicated the frequency of occurrence of wind pressures as those that occur annually in Japan and arise from wind speeds in excess of 5 m/s. The deflections induced by the wind pressures were those that occurred at the center of the IGU over a year when taking into account a range of wind pressures having recurrence intervals of 0.002-50 years; this was regarded as an annual fatigue load. The fatigue loads were then applied to the pane of the IGU test specimen, and the corresponding repeated movements occurred in the IGU rim seal. Experimental results show that the moisture permeance of the rim seal that had undergone the accumulated fatigue damage from testing increased by a factor of approximately six. Based on these results it becomes apparent that it is important to evaluate the change in moisture permeance due to fatigue driven by wind pressure fluctuations; this permits considering changing the design of the IGU rim seals to minimize the effects of wind-induced fatigue damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0066-0558,,978-0-8031-7653-9,,,,2018,1604,,,,,,149,167,,10.1520/STP160420170112,http://dx.doi.org/10.1520/STP160420170112,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000444220500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is of practical significance to study the effect of mulching and ridge types on soil water and heat in order to optimize mulching measures and improve the effectiveness of the ridge and furrow system. To clarify the combined effect of soil water and heat beneath the system and the influence of ridge morphology on it, field experiments were conducted with three treatments, including conventional planting in bare land (CK), a ridge-furrow (wide ridge with 70 cm width and 10 cm height, narrow ridge with 40 cm width and 15 cm height) mulching system with complete plastic film (RFWN) and a ridge-furrow (equal ridge with 55 cm width and 15 cm height) mulching system with complete plastic film (RFE). An insufficient irrigation system was adopted and the two-dimensional numerical software HYDRUS-2D was used to simulate the soil water and heat flow under the experimental conditions. The model was calibrated and verified according to test data for the period of 2018 to 2019, which showed good agreement between the simulated and measured values. The simulation results revealed that the ground temperatures of RFWN and RFE were much higher than that of CK, and the average value of 0-25 cm during the growth period could increase by 2.29-4.61%. Compared with CK, RFWN and RFE reduced soil evaporation (84.71-93.73%) and field evapotranspiration (12.02-21.75%), while they increased root water uptake (25.87-40.98%) and T/ET (48.85-80.15%). Plastic film mulching and ridge morphologies affected the infiltration range and the direction of soil water movement, increased soil moisture when there was no rainfall or irrigation and reduced soil water and heat fluctuations, which was more conducive to crop growth, especially under the RFWN system. The simulation method proposed in this paper is an effective technique for calculating the soil water and heat dynamics under different ridge and furrow sections under the condition of film mulching, and it can be used for the optimal management of soil water and heat in this area.",,,,,"郑, 利剑/ABH-3048-2021","GUO, Xianghong/0000-0002-9519-9555",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2077-0472,,,,NOV,2021,11,11,,,,,,,1099,10.3390/agriculture11111099,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11111099,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000725501700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lagrangian and other observations were made on the shelf where the filament arose and offshore in the filament itself under upwelling favourable but fluctuating winds. The shelf drift experiment monitored a change from southward to weak northward net flow as the winds decreased to zero. Shipborne ADCP measurements showed that the shelf was supplying decreasing volumes of water to the filament as the wind speeds decreased. At the shelf edge the internal tide was larger than can be explained by local forcing and there were many unusually large high frequency internal waves with a quasi-sinusoidal form. Turbulence observations revealed enhanced dissipation rates and vertical eddy diffusion coefficients within the shelf thermocline (of order 1 cm(2) s(-1)), which appeared to be caused by the breaking of internal wave. A second Lagrangian experiment was executed in the filament some 120 km offshore, which again coincided with a period of wind relaxation. Cross-sections revealed a double cold core and that the offshore flow was limited to a thin surface layer. Substantial onshore flow occurred below 50 m in the centre of the filament, while the strongest and deepest -offshore flow coincided with its northern boundary. Turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate measurements showed very weak mixing below 15 in in the filament core, but enhanced mixing at its boundaries. Four mixed layer drifters released in the filament initially indicated convergence at its southern boundary, marked by strong temperature and salinity contrasts. After the wind became more favourable for upwelling, the drifters accelerated. One drifter traced the full extent of the filament, while the other three escaped from it and began to circulate cyclonically over 28 days in a 100 km diameter loop back towards their release point. Although strong mesoscale activity linked the shelf and ocean regimes, offshore transport in the filament was weak at the time of the experiment and vertical and horizontal re-circulations on a variety of time scales were important. There was sufficient vertical mixing in the thermocline to cause it to thicken and draw some heat into the lower layers during the summer months on the shelf. The amount of heat involved was too little to have a significant impact on the development of a filament over a typical lifetime of a week. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Three of the 1000 L tanks were used as negative control tanks, with one tank for each family. Six 1000 L tanks were used for challenging the three families with WSSV, with two replicate tanks for each family.

WSSV infected minced frozen shrimp tissue was fed at a rate of 5% of average body weight one time on day 0. All tanks were equipped with air diffusers to provide sufficient aeration and an acclimated crushed oyster shell internal recirculating biological filter. Each tank was covered with a plastic sheet to contain aerosols and minimize water temperature fluctuations. The experimental tanks were checked daily and moribund animals were collected when observed and preserved in Davidson's AFA fixative.

J,"Backhaus, JO; Kampf, J",,,,"Backhaus, JO; Kampf, J",,,Simulations of sub-mesoscale oceanic convection and ice-ocean interactions in the Greenland Sea,DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,,,,,,,,,,,,"A high-resolution, rotational non-hydrostatic coupled ice-ocean convection model, defined in a vertical ocean slice, was applied to simulations of oceanic convection and its interaction with an ice cover. The model experiments exemplify typical mixed layer situations observed in the stratified upper Greenland Sea. Results are discussed in relation to observed hydrography, and ice conditions. The focus is placed on the initial penetrative phase of convection that covers small (sub-meso) spatial and temporal scales. Short episodes of strong atmospheric forcing (outbreaks of cold polar air) are considered. Simulations of convective erosion of both a shallow and a deep cold, low-saline surface 'freshwater' layer of the Greenland Sea highlight the thermal feedback on ice growth and surface buoyancy flux caused by an entrainment of warmer underlying waters. The entrainment, and an erosion of the stratification well below the actual penetration depth of convection, is caused by penetrative convective plumes. Plumes transmit fluctuations of non-hydrostatic pressure across isopycnals. The model predicted a transition from haline to predominantly thermal convection whenever ice formation was involved. After a cold-air outbreak the freshwater layer is largely re-established, but has increased salinity, and temperatures well above the freezing point. A thin ice cover( < 10 cm) with a coverage between 60 and 90% remains at the sea surface, thus impeding a deep penetration of convection for subsequent cold air outbreaks. With a moderate cooling ice formation and melting are in balance. The net buoyancy flux of the ice-ocean system attains zero values, and convection is shut off. Ice cover and ocean approach a state of stagnation which has often been observed. An attempt was made to hindcast an observed event of localised deep convection in the absence of sea ice. Forced by an oceanic heat loss of about 1000W/m(2) which lasted for 140h, the simulation reproduced the observed mixed-layer deepening from an initial 500 to 1200 m. These results and observations obtained with moored instruments suggest that deep reaching, penetrative convection in the Greenland Sea is the result of thermal convection,favoured by an ice-free ocean surface, rather than of haline convection. The increased frequency of sightings of a locally confined deep penetration of convection, in conjunction with the model hindcast, provide support for a hypothesised pre-conditioning of deep convection due to the mesoscale eigendynamics of the freshwater layer.

A population of this bivalve was monthly sampled in Playa Chucheros at the Bay of Malaga, Colombian Pacific, between August 1997 and July 1998, during the El Nino 1997/1998 phenomenon. Quantitative samples were taken in perpendicular and parallel to the coastal line transects to determine the population density and a length-frequency distribution. Qualitative samples were taken to study the reproduction and monthly length weight relationship. Sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity and pH in the water was monthly registered in the sampling station. Additionally, a tagging-recapture experiment was performed to growth estimations. Results indicate a continuous reproduction cycle with two annual spawning seasons in December and March. The growth parameters of the non-oscillating von Bertalanffy growth function were K = 0.62 yr(-1) and L-infinity = 29.3 mm. Mortality (Z) was higher (2.65 yr(-1)) for small individuals (between 2 mm and 5 mm) while a lower Z value (1.71 yr(-1)) were obtained for larger ones (between 19 mm and 25 mm). An annual mean biomass value of (B) over bar = 1.229 g ash-free dry weight m(-2) and an annual somatic production of P-som = 1.215 g ash-free dry weight m(-2) were estimated, which correspond to a P-som/(B) over bar value of 0.988. Population density increased in November and April, but any population density pattern related with El Nino was evident. Low body weight during November-December seems to show a relation between reproductive cycle in D. dentifer and El Nino 97/98 event. The fluctuation in dissolved oxygen show a high correlation with parameters of the reproductive cycle, which could be related to assimilation process and body weight cycle. Growth in D. dentifer in the Colombian Pacific coast was faster than other Donax species, as can be expected for tropical bivalves mollusks in comparison whit high latitude bivalves. The mortality pattern suggest that the population was selectively affected by El Nino 97/98, due to smaller individuals are living in the lowest areas of the beach, where they are exposed to abnormal seawater conditions for a longer time. Individual and population production was higher for medium-size animals than each for small-size ones, which were the most abundant in the population.",,,,,"Riascos, José M./J-5816-2013","Riascos, Jose/0000-0001-8631-8877",,,,,,,,,,,,,0034-7744,,,,,SEP-DEC,2002,50,3-4,,,,,1113,1123,,,,,,,,,,,12947594,,,,,WOS:000182175100029,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increased water flow has the potential to improve the capacity of some scleractinian corals to cope with high concentrations of oxygen in the boundary layer that are photosynthetically derived, and coral reef damage is often at its highest in areas where flow is restricted. Conversely, water motion has been shown to increase metabolic rate (both photosynthesis and respiration) and such flow-modulated metabolism may affect bleaching patterns asymmetrically within a coral colony. To broaden these earlier studies and to further examine the effects of flow on photosynthetic efficiency, we tested to determine whether or not corals would exhibit a spatially asymmetric distribution of photosynthetic efficiency related to velocity gradients (degree of mixing) across the coral colony. We conducted experiments from the NOAA underwater habitat Aquarius on colonies of Montastrea annularis (Ellis and Solander, 1786) with controlled exposures to increased flow (ca. 40 cm s(-1), 1 cm above coral surface) and temperature (ca. 2 degrees C above ambient) using in situ flow chambers. We measured photosynthetic efficiency as a light-adapted quantum yield (F-v'/F-m') using Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorometry to examine the short-term (daily) and medium term (>= 9 days) response of patches of polyps within coral colonies. M annularis colonies developed and sustained a significant spatially asymmetric pattern of photosynthetic yield across the entire coral surface, with the upstream side of the colonies exhibiting reduced quantum yield. The mechanism producing this pattern is unclear; we speculate that increased flow may lead to increased photosynthesis by upstream polyps through bicarbonate delivery accentuated by the Q(10) effect. Local down-regulation of the photosynthetic response (decreased quantum yield) might then occur to keep tissue oxygen concentrations within tolerable limits. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies of weathering processes within the catchment reported strong regolith dynamics associated with seasonal variations in the temperature and moisture regimes. A preliminary analysis of hydrological response and suspended sediment transport data recorded at a gauging station also demonstrated seasonal trends. The main objective of the present study is to understand the effect of regolith dynamics on sediment detachment and infiltration processes, based on field studies using simulated rainfall. The experiment design was based on seasonal differences in the physical conditions of surface regolith and the general trends of hydro-sedimentological responses. Rainfall simulations were conducted on small plots using a pressure nozzle. Similar experimental rainfall conditions were set for all plots (rainfall intensity around 45 mm h(-1)). The results showed strong variations in the infiltration and detachment responses closely associated with the regolith conditions and crusting development. Infiltration showed seasonal differences in time lag and intensity: average infiltration rates ranged from very low (2,05 mm h(-1)) to moderated high values (44.04 mm h(-1)) associated to regolith development conditions. Maximum sediment concentration, as an indicator of particles produced by detachment, also ranged from moderate (3 g l(-1)) to extreme values (145 g l(-1)). Mean and minimum infiltration rates showed negative correlations with initial moisture content. Sediment concentration showed a positive correlation with time lag, ponding, and sealing time, and a negative correlation with initial moisture. In terms of seasonal trends, infiltration and erosion responses were relatively stable during spring and autumn, whereas wide variations were recorded in infiltration rates and sediment detachment during summer and winter. As a general conclusion, the obtained results indicate that seasonal differences in detachment and infiltration depend on the nature of regolith development.

The availability of dietary proteins is a key factor limiting the population growth of herbivore species. The objective of this study is to investigate the degree to which protein availability influences the growth of increasing vole populations. We hypothesise that the summer growth of folivorous vole populations is positively associated with dietary protein availability. A field experiment was conducted over a summer reproductive period in 18 vegetated enclosures. Populations of field voles (Microtus agrestis) were randomised amongst three treatment groups: 1) food supplementation with ad libitum high protein (30% dry weight) pellets, 2) food supplementation with ad libitum low protein (1% dry weight; both supplemented foods had equivalent energy content) pellets, and 3) control (no food supplementation), n = 6 per treatment. Vole density, survival, demographic attributes and condition indicators were monitored with live-trapping and blood sampling. Highest final vole densities were attained in populations that received high protein supplementation and lowest in low protein populations. Control populations displayed intermediate densities. The survival rate of voles was similar in all treatment groups. The proportion of females, and of those that were pregnant or lactating, was highest in the high protein supplemented populations. This suggests that variation in reproductive, rather than survival rates of voles, accounted for density differences between the treatment groups. We found no clear association between population demography and individual physiological condition. Our results demonstrate that dietary protein availability limits vole population growth during the summer growing season. This suggests that the nutritional quality of forage may be an underestimated source of interannual variation in the density and growth rates of widely fluctuating populations of herbivorous small mammals.",,,,,"Mappes, Tapio/B-9780-2013; Hoset, Katrine S./A-5090-2010; Stuart, Peter/N-1830-2016","Hoset, Katrine S./0000-0002-1371-012X; Mappes, Tapio/0000-0002-5936-7355",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,MAR 12,2014,9,3,,,,,,,e91113,10.1371/journal.pone.0091113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0091113,,,,,,,,24621513,,,,,WOS:000332845300051,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the vegetation dynamics during 20002015 were investigated in the downstream area of the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in Northwest China where an ecological water diversion project (EWDP) commenced in 2000. The spatio-temporal relationships between vegetation cover and climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) and available water resources (river flow and groundwater) were determined. The results indicated that the mean growing season NDVI increased significantly during the period of 2000-2015, and the area of East Juyan Lake (EJL) enlarged to 36.4 km(2) in 2010. The scale effect of the relationships between NDVI and hydro-climatic factors was obvious. At the catchment scale, changes of NDVI were not significantly correlated with climatic factors, but significantly related with the antecedent 1year river flow. River flow played an important role in vegetation growth within approximately 2000m distance from the river bank. At the pixel scale, the changes of NDVI were significantly positive with temperature and river flow in 17.40% and 7.14% of the study area, respectively, whereas significant relationship between NDVI and precipitation occurred in only 0.65% of study area. The suitable water table depth for vegetation growth was between 1.8 and 3.5 m. The increased river flow and recovered groundwater due to the EWDP were critical for the improvement of vegetation cover, whereas the riparian vegetation degraded along some parts of the river bank. It is important to improve integrated watershed management with consideration of spatio-temporal lagged hydro-ecological connections in the study area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We tested whether a similar effect could be observed in a different plant-herbivore system: the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata and its co-evolved specialist herbivore, Manduca sexta. We measured larval growth on plants under both constant and diurnal conditions following identical or opposite entrainment, profiled the metabolome of attacked leaf tissue, quantified specific metabolites known to reduce M. sexta growth, and monitored M. sexta feeding activity under all experimental conditions. Entrainment did not consistently affect M. sexta growth or plant defense induction. However, both were reduced under constant dark conditions, as was M. sexta feeding activity.

Three hypotheses were tested to determine if specific environmental effects on staple strength could be detected under field conditions. First, environmental stresses associated with rainfall and low temperature, resulting in a sudden disruption of warm summer-autumn conditions and lack of feed, may cause follicle shutdown. Second, the sudden decline in feed available following the rain event and the response of sheep to chase the green pick rather than eat the available dry feed may reduce the flow of nutrients to wool. Third, the slow adaptation by rumen microorganisms to changes in the diet from dry to green pasture may result in a further reduction of nutrients available to the wool follicle. We compared a group of sheep managed to minimise nutrient intake fluctuations at the break of season with a group grazing under normal farm practice and tested the hypothesis that a specific lowering of staple strength is associated with the break of season. On 2 April (3 days after the first rains of the season), 120, 18-month-old Merino wethers were allocated to 2 groups, paddock and yard. The paddock group comprised sheep following normal farm practice. The yard group was confined to yards and fed to maintain liveweight, to determine whether the break in the staple was associated with the rainfall event or with the subsequent changes in feed intake. These animals were left off feed for 4 days beginning 24 April. Within each group, 2 separate treatments were imposed. The paddock group was split, and half were moved into covered pens inside a shearing shed on 15 May, a few days before a second major rainfall event, to examine directly stresses associated with rainfall. The sheep from the yard group were kept as a single mob until 3 June, when they were split into 2 groups, sudden and gradual, in relation to their release onto green pasture, to examine the effect of adaptation time to green feed on the flow of nutrients to wool and staple strength. The sudden group was released onto green pasture, while the gradual group was given access to the pasture for increasing periods over the next week. The point of break was delayed by moving sheep into yards after the initial rainfall, suggesting that the rain event per se was not the direct cause of the break in the staple in this experiment. Furthermore, protecting the paddock sheep against the second major rainfall event by shedding half of them did not affect staple strength. The point of break in the staple in the yard group occurred after an accidental 4-day feed deprivation period. This indicates that even short periods of liveweight loss from feed deprivation due to poor or inattentive management when sheep are in low nutritional condition at this time of the year may precipitate the point of break. The rate of release onto green feed after yarding did not significantly affect staple strength and we conclude this was not an important factor. We conclude that neither stress associated with rainfall nor adaptation of ruminal microorganisms to the change in feed weakened the wool.",,,,,"Mata, Gonzalo/H-1160-2013","Mata, Gonzalo/0000-0003-3470-843X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0816-1089,1836-5787,,,,,1999,39,4,,,,,401,409,,10.1071/EA98056,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA98056,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081678400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

H.",,,Pathway dynamics can delineate the sources of transcriptional noise in gene expression,ELIFE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Single-cell expression profiling opens up new vistas on cellular processes. Extensive cell-to-cell variability at the transcriptomic and proteomic level has been one of the stand-out observations. Because most experimental analyses are destructive we only have access to snapshot data of cellular states. This loss of temporal information presents significant challenges for inferring dynamics, as well as causes of cell-to-cell variability. In particular, we typically cannot separate dynamic variability from within cells ('intrinsic noise') from variability across the population ('extrinsic noise'). Here, we make this non-identifiability mathematically precise, allowing us to identify new experimental set-ups that can assist in resolving this non-identifiability. We show that multiple generic reporters from the same biochemical pathways (e.g. mRNA and protein) can infer magnitudes of intrinsic and extrinsic transcriptional noise, identifying sources of heterogeneity. Stochastic simulations support our theory, and demonstrate that 'pathway-reporters' compare favourably to the well-known, but often difficult to implement, dual-reporter method. eLife digest In biology, seemingly random variation within or between cells can have significant effects on a number of cellular processes, like how cells divide and develop. For example, how often a gene is switched on, or 'expressed', can randomly fluctuate over time. This 'noise' may lead to a cell having slightly more of a particular molecule, causing it to behave differently to other cells in the population. However, it is currently unclear how this random variation is created and controlled in cells, and what effect this has on biological systems as a whole. When a gene is expressed, its sequence typically gets copied in to a molecule called mRNA, which is then processed and used to build the protein encoded by the gene. By measuring the levels of mRNA molecules in individual cells, researchers have been able to investigate how gene expression varies within populations. These experiments are carried out on dead cells at a single point in time, and mathematical models are then applied to detect noise in the molecular data. This approach, however, precludes how noise changes over time, making it difficult to determine the source of cell-to-cell variability. In particular, whether the variation detected is the result of genuine random molecular changes (intrinsic noise), or external factors - such as temperature and pH - fluctuating in the cells environment (extrinsic noise). Here, Ham et al. have built on previous mathematical models to identify a new approach for investigating the source of molecular noise. They found that for any given gene it is impossible to understand what causes its activity levels to vary just from data on its mRNA levels. Instead, information on other molecules that are affected by expression of the gene (termed 'pathway reporters') can provide a clearer picture of whether molecular variability is the result of intrinsic or extrinsic noise. The mathematical models developed by Ham et al. reveal what can and cannot be learned about noise from gene expression data. Furthermore, pathway-reporters are easier to measure experimentally than other reporters that are typically used to study the origins and effects of cell-to-cell variability. These findings could help researchers design single cell experiments that are better for studying noise, leading to a deeper understanding of how different types of variation impact cell biology.",,,,,"Jackson, Marcel/GXW-0403-2022","Jackson, Marcel/0000-0002-8149-1141; Ham, Lucy/0000-0002-5168-1083",,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-084X,,,,,OCT 12,2021,10,,,,,,,,e69324,10.7554/eLife.69324; 10.7554/eLife.69324.sa1; 10.7554/eLife.69324.sa2,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.69324; 10.7554/eLife.69324.sa1; 10.7554/eLife.69324.sa2,,,,,,,,34636320,,,,,WOS:000723148800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A multiple-load-cell apparatus, time-series analysis of the measured data, and residual low-pass filtering methods were used to monitor continuously and analyse transpiration of potted tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Ailsa Craig) grown in a temperature-controlled greenhouse during well-irrigated and drought periods. A time derivative of the filtered residual time series yielded oscillatory behaviour of the whole plant's transpiration (WPT) rate. A subsequent cross-correlation analysis between the WPT oscillatory pattern and wet-wick evaporation rates (vertical cotton fabric, 0.14 m(2) partly submerged in water in a container placed on an adjacent load cell) revealed that autonomous oscillations in WPT rate develop under a continuous increase in water stress, whereas these oscillations correspond with the fluctuations in evaporation rate when water is fully available. The relative amplitude of these autonomous oscillations increased with water stress as transpiration rate decreased. These results support the recent finding that an increase in xylem tension triggers hydraulic signals that spread instantaneously via the plant vascular system and control leaf conductance. The regulatory role of synchronized oscillations in WPT rate in eliminating critical xylem tension points and preventing embolism is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,JUL,2010,61,12,,,,,3439,3449,,10.1093/jxb/erq168,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq168,,,,,,,,20558570,,,,,WOS:000280016200021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, building energy simulation results provide insight into the energy impact of five levels of museum indoor climate conditioning applied to four building quality levels (ranging from a historical building to a purpose-built museum building) using weather data from twenty locations throughout Europe. The five levels of indoor climate conditioning were calculated using the presented setpoint algorithm, a validated simulation model of museum Hermitage Amsterdam was adjusted to represent the four building quality levels, and technical-reference-year (TRY) weather data of twenty locations were used. The conclusions: The setpoint algorithm enables smooth control of seasonal adjustments, integrated with permissible short fluctuations of T and RH (according to ASHRAE classes); improving the building quality quickly follows the law of diminishing returns; supposing to result in the same collection risk, subclass A(d) (no seasonal adjustments, but larger hourly fluctuations) is more energy efficient than subclass A, (with seasonal adjustments, but smaller hourly fluctuations) for most locations; although class AA is more stringent than subclass A(s), class AA appears to require less energy than subclass A(s) for some locations, due to efficiency differences of the humidification and dehumidification processes.

However, studies addressing physiological analyzes are usually focused on the isolation of a stress factor, making it difficult to understand plants behavior in their extremely complex natural environments. Herein, we analyzed how environmental variability (noise) may influence physiological processes of Glycine max under water deficit conditions. The plants were kept in a greenhouse (semi-controlled environment - E-SC) and in a growth chamber (controlled environment - E-C) under two water regime conditions (100 and 30% of replacement of the water lost by evapotranspiration) for 30 days. The environmental variability was daily monitored with automatic sensors to record temperature, humidity, and irradiance. The physiological responses were analyzed by leaf gas exchanges, chlorophyll fluorescence, biomembrane integrity, and growth parameters. The results showed that water deficiency caused significant reductions in the physiological parameters evaluated. However, the environment with high variability (E-SC) caused more extensive damages to biomembranes, regardless the water regime likely compromising physiological efficiency. The lower variability of E-C promoted higher efficiency of total biomass production in both water regimes compared to the E-SC. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that more variable environmental conditions can limit the growth of Glycine max in response to the fluctuation of resources, therefore amplifying the effect of water deficit.",,,,,"Souza, Gustavo Maia/M-2661-2013; Bertolli, Suzana/S-1818-2019; Souza, Gustavo/AAE-8759-2020","Souza, Gustavo Maia/0000-0001-6754-4860; Bertolli, Suzana/0000-0002-4302-0074; Souza, Gustavo/0000-0001-6754-4860",,,,,,,,,,,,,2197-0025,,,,,,2013,25,1,,,,,36,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000339615800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The first approach used an oscillating circuit whose frequency (40 to 70 kHz) was determined by a parallel-plate capacitor that sandwiched a portion of the stem. The second technique was based on measurement of the velocity of an electromagnetic pulse (frequency range of 500 kHz and 1 GHz) propagating within a wave-guide embedded in the stem (Time-Domain Reflectometry, TDR). There was basic agreement in the apparent dielectric constant as determined by the two techniques; both resulted in values of approximately 90 when the plant was fully hydrated, falling to values near 50 when water was withheld for one week. The capacitance technique was non-invasive, but was influenced by temperature fluctuations, and we were unable to calibrate it accurately against stem volumetric water content. Insertion of TDR probes did not lead to tissue damage and determination of an empirical relationship to volumetric water content allowed quantitative estimates of stem water content. Sensitivity of TDR to small changes in stem water content was restricted by the fact that attenuation of the pulse within the stem necessitated the use of short (0.125 m) wave guides.

Here, we report a meta-analysis of 35 food supplementation studies demonstrating that species at high latitudes are less responsive to food supplementation than those at lower latitudes. Because the length of the breeding season varies with latitude, species at high latitudes may rely mostly upon photic cues and be less responsive to other environmental information. Lower latitude species, where times suitable for breeding vary from year-to-year, are predicted to be more responsive to supplementary'' information to adjust reproduction to coincide with conditions that favor the successful rearing of young. Studies by Wingfield et al. (Gen Comp Endocrinol 101: 242-255, 1996; Gen Comp Endocrinol 107: 44 62, 1997; Gen Comp Endocrinol 131: 143-158, 2003) suggest a physiological underpinning to this reduced responsiveness to supplementary information in high-latitude species. Given that temperature increases resulting from global climate change are most pronounced at high latitude, reduced plasticity to respond to these changes in individuals of high-latitude species could cause high-latitude breeders to be poorly synchronized with a resource base that emerges earlier than usual. If high-latitude breeders indeed lack sufficient individual-level plasticity to cope effectively with climate fluctuations, effective optimization of reproductive timing in a rapidly changing environment would require similarly rapid evolutionary change. It remains to be seen whether this will be possible.",,,,,"Schoech, Stephan J./A-3882-2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2193-7192,2193-7206,,,,DEC,2007,148,,,2,,,S625,S632,,10.1007/s10336-007-0177-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-007-0177-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000255199000056,View Full Record in Web of Science

The external cues that trigger timely flowering vary greatly across tropical and temperate plant taxa, the latter relying on predictable seasonal fluctuations in temperature and photoperiod. In the grass family (Poaceae) for example, species of the subfamily Pooideae have become specialists of the northern temperate hemisphere, generating the hypothesis that their progenitor evolved a flowering response to long days from a short-day or day-neutral ancestor. Sampling across the Pooideae, we found support for this hypothesis, and identified several secondary shifts to day-neutral flowering and one to short-day flowering in a tropical highland clade. To explain the proximate mechanisms for the secondary transition back to short-day-regulated flowering, we investigated the expression of CCT domain genes, some of which are known to repress flowering in cereal grasses under specific photoperiods. We found a shift in CONSTANS 1 and CONSTANS 9 expression that coincides with the derived short-day photoperiodism of our exemplar species Nassella pubiflora.

However, the underlying mechanisms and the extent to which this occurs are not well known. MutS Homolog 1 (MSH1) mutants cause heritable developmental phenotypes accompanied by modulation of defense, phytohormone, stress-response, and circadian rhythm genes, as well as heritable changes in DNA methylation patterns. Consistent with gene expression changes, msh1 mutants display enhanced tolerance for abiotic stress including drought and salt stress, while showing increased susceptibility to freezing temperatures. Despite changes in defense and biotic stress-response genes, msh1 mutants showed increasing susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Our results suggest that chronic cold and low light stress (10 degrees C, 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) influences non-CG methylation to a greater degree in msh1 mutants compared to wild-type Col-0. Furthermore, CHG changes are more closely pericentromeric, whereas CHH changes are generally more dispersed. This increased variation in non-CG methylation pattern does not significantly affect the msh1-derived enhanced growth behavior after mutants are crossed with isogenic wild type, reiterating the importance of CG methylation changes in msh1-derived enhanced vigor. These results indicate that msh1methylome is hyper-responsive to environmental stress in a manner distinct from the wild-type response, but CG methylation changes are potentially responsible for growth vigor changes in the crossed progeny.",,,,,"Kenchanmane Raju, Sunil/I-6721-2019","Kenchanmane Raju, Sunil/0000-0001-8960-094X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2475-4455,,,,AUG,2018,2,8,,,,,,,79,10.1002/pld3.79,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.79,,,,,,,,31245744,,,,,WOS:000509894200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Salmon held in research-scale sea cages were exposed to light movements between depths of 0-12 m and at 5 different speeds (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 m min(-1)) on 3 nights. Fish were acclimated to lights fixed at 8 m depth in a temperature-and salinity-stratified cage environment, partitioning salmon into surface-positioned (47%) and light-positioned subgroups (53% of the population). A high proportion (50-65%) of the light-positioned group followed lights be tween upper and lower cage sections when moved up to a critical speed of 4 m min(-1). However, the surface-positioned group always persisted. Following decreased when lights were moved at higher speeds, equivalent to or faster than fish swimming speeds measured under fixed lighting.

Across the small horizontal scale of the shelf, large changes in the vertical distribution and flux of nitrate maintain elevated productivity, driving variability in the vertical distribution of biomass and the integrated biomass and productivity of the entire shelf. Temporal variability from hours to days in chlorophyll fluorescence as measured by an autonomous profiling vehicle demonstrates that phytoplankton respond vigorously and rapidly to physical variability. The interaction of physical processes at different temporal and spatial scales is responsible for the observed biological gradients. These dynamics include: (1) vertical shear in the alongshore currents, (2) local wind forcing, (3) the internal tide, and (4) remote, large-scale variability. Individually, these mechanisms rarely or never explain the phytoplankton community composition and metabolic rate gradients.

The objective of study was to evaluate the applicability of the kriging method for the analysis of the groundwater level. Field observation data collected in Sosnowica in 2011 were used (Western Polesie). The study area is located in Eastern Poland in the province of Lublin and has an temperate climate with temperature extremes -30 degrees C and 35 degrees C (average 8 degrees C).

The study comprises experimental trials, which were carried out over two consecutive years (2020-2021) on two experimental areas (site 1: Koel, site 2: Moel) in District Bhimber of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. Wheat cv. Punjab-2018 was used in the experiment. The experiment was performed in a split-plot factorial arrangement with the main experimental plot bisected into two subplots. Within the two halves of the experimental plot, one side experienced the original tillage practice (PT--by ploughing at a depth of 4-6 cm; HT--by harrowing at 12-15 cm; NT--no tillage, of subsoil or soil ploughing). The subsoiling technique applied included subsoiling ploughing tillage (SPT), subsoiling harrow tillage (SHT), and subsoiling of no-tillage (SNT). Subsoiling was performed by means of ploughing land utilizing a vibrating subsoil trowel to a depth of 14 to 14.5 inches. As a result, each subplot was divided into three replicates. So, a total of six replicates, each 35 m in length and 4 m in width were chosen for the experiment. The results depicted that the influx of COx uptake increased in all subsoiling treatments: that is, SPT, SHT, and SNT. The uptake of COx was comparatively lower in HT, RT, and NT. In the same manner, GWP for NOx was recorded to increase when the soil was subjected to subsoiling, that is, HTS, RTS, and NTS. Along with this, the trend of soil temperature and soil content also fluctuated with R-2 = 0.78 at p < 0.01 from February to April and R-2 = 0.66 from December to January, which shows that SAP causes higher emission of NOx and more uptake of COx. Subsoiling maintains soil moisture content (SMC) and soil organic carbon (SOC), which allows limited release of NOx from soil, maintaining the soil nitrogen content. In the case of SOC and pH, it was found that higher pH causes reduced absorption of COx into soil and NOx emission from soil while higher SOC causes more absorption of COx into soil and more emission of NOx. The application of smart agriculture in the form of subsoiling leads to an increase in the yield of wheat crops and is recommended in agriculture in the context of climate change.",,,,,"Ishtiaq, Muhammad/GSN-4278-2022; Elansary, Hosam O./E-3684-2019; Dewidar, Ahmed/GYQ-6203-2022","Elansary, Hosam O./0000-0002-4476-2408; Yessoufou, Kowiyou/0000-0002-4789-1723; Ishtiaq, Dr M/0000-0003-2468-1413; Mazhar, Muhammad Waqas/0000-0003-2870-6681",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2071-1050,,,,AUG,2022,14,16,,,,,,,10453,10.3390/su141610453,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141610453,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000845187300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A landscape approach is adopted, emphasising associations of land forms and sediments and the importance of spatial and temporal transitions in earth surface processes. The broadest classes of cold region are the zonal or higher latitude examples, and the azonal ones based on elevation, continentality and air mass regimes. Vast and singular subregions are also characterised by cold tolerant ecosystems such as heathlands and bogs, boreal or montane forests. These play a major role in landform development and appearance in their respective zones. Work relating to earth surface processes tends to separate glacierised (i.e., icecovered) and non-glacierised areas, in the latter, periglacial and nival regimes, and cold coastal conditions. Cold regions geomorphology, in recent decades, has focused on processes peculiar to low temperatures and freeze-thaw. Much of our understanding has developed out of specialised investigations and experimental work on distinctive processes of these regimes, and the search for more abstract, general models of them. But a regional and comparative perspective must also recognise the large role played by weathering, fluvial, lacustrine, marine or aeolian processes shared with other regions if modified in cold contexts. A landscape and comparative interest directs attention to the variety of landform associations and related sediment assemblages, and how they represent the complexities of on-going and historical development. Most cold regions landscapes record past and on-going environmental change. They contain more or less extensive legacies of clima-hydrological, ecological and geotectonic changes in the Quaternary. They involve glaciation and deglaciation, isostatic crustal adjustments, fluctuations in sea levels and in the extent of marine and freshwater ice, changes in snow covers, seasonal ground ice, and the patterns and thickness of permafrost. These legacies, and how they are removed or transformed, are integral to the interpretation of existing cold region landscapes. What we observe are geomorphic palimsests in which relict, overlapping and replacement forms are interwoven. The notion of transition addresses the sense in which landscape development is not merely chronological and linear, or simply a lagged response to climatic and tectonic changes. There are diachronous episodes of (incomplete) readjustment to the cessation of past conditions, and towards later conditions, of which those at present are only one set. There are distinctive spatial and temporal patterns of adjustment, including 14 self-adjustment specific to the earth surface processes at work. The paraglacial is a classic example. It is suggested that such temporal and spatial responses in earth surface processes apply much more generally as part of landscape transformation in the Quaternary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1-4020-0663-2,,,,2002,68,,,,,,1,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000178260200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we selected four kinds of pressure-compensating emitters and four kinds of non-pressure-compensating emitters, and executed the experiment of drip irrigation with on-site reclaimed water treated with cyclic activated sludge system (CASS). The emitter discharge ratio variation (Dra), coefficient of uniformity (CU) and clogging rate distribution were analyzed to evaluate the emitter clogging characteristics after eliminating the effect of temperature and pressure on the emitter outflow by data correction. The results showed that Dra and CU varied in three periods as system operation. The beginning of experiment was the fluctuated balance period, Dra and CU recurrent fluctuated in 5 %, and the emitters clogged at some spots after the system run 36-48 h. Then the two parameters varied linearly in 60-108 h, tuning into the initiate linear period, as the non-pressure-compensating emitters got an obvious linear change than the pressure-compensating ones with the gradient changed from -0.094 to 0.042 and -0.073 to 0.047, respectively. Some of the emitters have a significant difference on these two parameters at this stage. After the restarting in the second year, Dra and CU decreased sharply. The maximum decrement was, respectively, 9.6 and 10.7 %. Then they varied in line with a greater slope degree as all emitters reached the significant level, the gradient ranges were -0.176 to 0.115 and -0.216 to 0.117, respectively. This stage was called the accelerated linear period. Seriously clogged and completely clogged emitters appeared, and both Dra and CU dropped down to 38.7 and 41.5 %. Various degrees of clogged emitters often emerged in the end part of lateral at first then propelled to the head gradually, the completely clogged emitters in the end accounted for more than 73.0 % when the system run 540 h. Comprehensively considered, the pressure-compensating emitters and cusp-shaped saw-tooth non-pressure-compensating emitters with short flow path are recommended in reclaimed water drip irrigation. These researches are aimed to provide references explaining the emitter clogging mechanism of reclaimed water drip irrigation as well as its technological application and popularization.",,,,,,"Li, Yunkai/0000-0003-4226-3805",,,,,,,,,,,,,0342-7188,1432-1319,,,,MAR,2014,32,2,,,,,141,157,,10.1007/s00271-013-0420-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00271-013-0420-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000332017800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We simultaneously exposed larvae of the sea urchin Arbacia lixula to ocean acidification in laboratory and natural CO2 vents and assessed the arm growth response as a proxy of net calcification. Populations of embryos were simultaneously placed at both control and volcanic CO2 vent sites in Ischia (Italy), with a parallel group maintained in the laboratory in control and low pH treatments corresponding to the mean pH levels of the field sites. As expected, larvae grown at constant low pH (pH(T) 7.8) in the laboratory exhibited reduced arm growth, but counter to expectations, the larvae that developed at the low pH vent site (pH(T) 7.33-7.99) had the longest arms. The larvae at the control field site (pH(T) 7.87-7.99) grew at a similar rate to laboratory controls. Salinity, temperature, oxygen and flow regimes were comparable between control and vent sites; however, chlorophyll a levels and particulate organic carbon were higher at the vent site than at the control field site. This increased food availability may have modulated the effects of low pH, creating an opposite calcification response in the laboratory from that in the field. Divergent responses of the same larval populations developing in laboratory and field environments show the importance of considering larval phenotypic plasticity and the complex interactions among decreased pH, food availability and larval responses.

The experiment was set up in a bifactorial split-plot design with 4 replications. The mean values of the growth indices were calculated using the classic method of growth analysis, while the Hunt-Parsons (1974) growth analysis programme was used for the functional method of growth analysis. The following indices of growth analysis were calculated to characterise the effect of sowing date: crop growth rate (CGR), relative growth rate (RGR), leaf area index (LAI), net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area growth rate (ALGR) and biomass duration (BMD). The Hunt-Parsons programme characterised the dynamics of total dry matter production with a third-degree exponential polynomial. Sowing date had differing effects on dry matter accumulation in the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. In the case of the late solving date dry matter accumulation was greater during the initial phase of vegetative growth, but terminated sooner due to early flowering, leading to a significantly lower maximum dry matter production per plant after late sowing than for the early sowing date. Average and early sowing dates were favourable for both vegetative and reproductive growth. Sowing date had different effects on the dynamics and mean values of the growth indices in the vegetative and reproductive stages of growth. In the initial phase of vegetative growth the values of the growth indices were greater after late sowing than after early or average sowing dates. In the reproductive growth stage, however, the values of the indices were greatest in the early and average sowing date treatments and smallest after late sowing. The dynamics and mean values of the growth indices calculated with the classic method and using the HP model expressed similar tendencies for the effect of sowing date. The greatest fluctuation from the regular was observed in the growth dynamics of CGR and NAR calculated with the classic method. Studies on the correlation between maize grain yields and growth indices revealed the importance of the growth indices examined. On the basis of R-2, the multiple determination coefficient, 90-91 % of the variance of the maize grain yield was determined by growth indices and climatic factors. Path analysis showed that during the vegetative growth stage LAI had a greater effect on CGR than NAR. In the reproductive growth stage, however, CGR depended more on NAR than on LAI. Despite the obvious advantages of the Hunt-Parsons growth analysis programme, the combined use of the classic and functional methods is to be recommended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0546-8191,,,,,DEC,1998,47,6,,,,,655,676,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000079219700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

To elucidate the hydrological characteristics of this near-surface glacial weathering crust, we describe the design and operation of a capacitance-based piezometer that enables rapid, economical deployment across multiple sites and provides an accurate, high-resolution record of near-surface water-level fluctuations. Piezometers were employed at 10 northern hemisphere glaciers, and through the application of standard bail-recharge techniques, we derive hydraulic conductivity (K) values from 0.003 to 3.519m day(-1), with a mean of 0.185 +/- 0.019m day(-1). These results are comparable to those obtained in other discrete studies of glacier near-surface ice, and for firn, and indicate that the weathering crust represents a hydrologically inefficient aquifer. Hydraulic conductivity correlated positively with water table height but negatively with altitude and cumulative short-wave radiation since the last synoptic period of either negative air temperatures or turbulent energy flux dominance. The large range of K observed suggests complex interactions between meteorological influences and differences arising from variability in ice structure and crystallography. Our data demonstrate a greater complexity of near-surface ice hydrology than hitherto appreciated and support the notion that the weathering crust can regulate the supraglacial discharge response to melt production. The conductivities reported here, coupled with typical supraglacial channel spacing, suggest that meltwater can be retained within the weathering crust for at least several days. Not only does this have implications for the accuracy of predictive meltwater run-off models, but we also argue for biogeochemical processes and transfers that are strongly conditioned by water residence time and the efficacy of the cascade of sediments, impurities, microbes, and nutrients to downstream ecosystems. Because continued atmospheric warming will incur rising snowline elevations and glacier thinning, the supraglacial hydrological system may assume greater importance in many mountainous regions, and consequently, detailing weathering crust hydraulics represents a research priority because the flow path it represents remains poorly constrained.",,,,,,"Hodson, Andrew/0000-0002-1255-7987; Moorman, Brian/0000-0001-7565-5309; Cook, Joseph/0000-0002-9270-363X; Irvine-Fynn, Tristram/0000-0003-3157-6646; Stevens, Ian/0000-0001-6374-9500",,,,,,,,,,,,,0885-6087,1099-1085,,,,MAR 30,2018,32,7,,,,,850,865,,10.1002/hyp.11439,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11439,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000428523900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To elucidate this relationship, we measured BMR and TEWL rates in both field-acclimatized and laboratory-acclimated adult rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis). Measurements in field-acclimatized birds were taken during the winter and summer seasons; in the laboratory-acclimated birds, we took our measurements following 4 weeks at either 15 or 30A degrees C. Although BMR and TEWL rates did not differ between winter and summer in the field-acclimatized birds, laboratory-acclimated birds exposed to 15A degrees C exhibited both a higher BMR and TEWL rate when compared to the birds acclimated to 30A degrees C and the field-acclimatized birds. Because organ masses seem to be similar between field and cold-acclimated birds whereas BMR is higher in cold-acclimated birds, the variability in BMR cannot be explained completely by adjustments in organ masses. Our findings suggest that, although rufous-collared sparrows can exhibit thermal acclimation of physiological traits, sparrows do not use this capacity to cope with minor to moderate fluctuations in environmental conditions.

Soil moisture regime has been suggested as a potentially important factor in determining soil organic C (SOC) content. However, few studies have specifically investigated soil moisture regime effects on SOM, SOC, or N storage or sequestration. The objective of this study was to evaluate potential regional differences in the effects of land use and soil moisture regime on changes in near-surface SOM, SOC, and total N (TN) contents and C:N ratio during a 6-year period in a silt-loam soil. Soil bulk density, SOM, and SOC, and TN changes during a 6-year period were measured on replicate samples collected from the top 10 cm in udic and aquic soil moisture regimes representing both managed agriculture and native grassland in the Ozark Highlands region of northwest Arkansas and in the Grand Prairie region of east central Arkansas. All treatment factors examined affected soil bulk density over time. Soil OM and SOC storage were affected by region, land use, and soil moisture regime, but SOM and SOC sequestration were unaffected by soil moisture regime. However, TN content increased by 0.03 kg m(-2) over time in the aquic moisture regime in the Ozark Highlands and decreased by 0.03 kg m(-2) in the Grand Prairie. Total N content also increased over time in the udic moisture regime by 0.03 kg m(-2) under native prairie and decreased by 0.03 kg m(-2) under agricultural land use. It is clear that the average degree of wetness a soil experiences, as indicated by soil taxonomy's soil moisture regime, directly affects N storage, cycling, and sequestration, and indirectly affects SOM and SOC cycling through effects on the soil C:N ratio. Soil moisture regime differences that may exist among sites and/or treatments should be at least examined and accounted for when necessary in future studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-075X,,,,,JUL,2010,175,7,,,,,339,348,,10.1097/SS.0b013e3181e83db2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SS.0b013e3181e83db2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000279637000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The general circulation models used in this way cannot resolve a full range of vigorous mesoscale activity ton length scales between 10-100 km). In the real ocean, however, this activity causes important variability in tracer fields. Thus, in order to rationally compare tracer observations with model predictions these unresolved fluctuations (the model variability error) must be estimated. We have analyzed this variability using an eddy-resolving reduced-gravity model in a simple midlatitude double-gyre configuration. We find that the wave number spectrum of tracer variance is only weakly sensitive to the distribution of (large scale slowly varying) tracer sources and sinks. This suggests that a universal passive tracer spectrum may exist in the ocean. We estimate the spectral shape using high-resolution measurements of potential temperature on an isopycnal in the upper northeast Atlantic Ocean, finding a slope near k(-1.7) between 10 and 500 km. The typical magnitude of the variance is estimated by comparing tracer simulations using different resolutions. For CFC- and tritium-type transient tracers the peak magnitude of the model variability saturation error may reach 0.20 for scales shorter than 100 km. This is of the same order as the time mean saturation itself and well over an order of magnitude greater than the instrumental uncertainty.",,,,,"Gray, Suzanne L/J-6485-2016","Gray, Suzanne L/0000-0001-8658-362X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,JUL 15,2001,106,C7,,,,,13861,13878,,10.1029/1999JC000036,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1999JC000036,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000169871100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, the underlying physiological significances as well as the ontogenetic establishment of this crosstalk remain largely unknown. Here, we used a teleost fish, the European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, to investigate: (1) whether the regulation of thymus plasticity relies on resource trade-off with somatic growth and reproductive investment and (2) if the gonad-thymus interaction takes place during gonadal differentiation and development. Because gonadal development and, supposedly, thymus function in sea bass depend on environmental changes associated with the winter season, we evaluated thymus changes (foxnl expression, and thymocyte and T cell content) in juvenile D. labrax raised for 1 year under either constant or fluctuating photoperiod and temperature. Importantly, in both conditions, intensive gonadal development following sex differentiation coincided with a halt of thymus growth, while somatic growth continued. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that gonadal development during prepuberty regulates thymus plasticity. This finding may provide an explanation for the initiation of the thymus involution related to ageing in mammals. Comparing fixed and variable environmental conditions, our work also demonstrates that the extent of the effects on the thymus, which are related to reproduction, depend on ecophysiological conditions, rather than being directly related to sexual maturity and sex hormone levels.",,,,,"; Pinto, Patricia IS/M-3817-2013","monsinjon, Tiphaine/0000-0001-6959-5522; Knigge, Thomas/0000-0002-6835-1080; Paiola, Matthieu/0000-0002-3536-861X; Pinto, Patricia IS/0000-0001-7854-3898; Hetru, Julie/0000-0002-9967-6582",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,APR,2021,224,7,,,,,,,jeb238576,10.1242/jeb.238576,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.238576,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000651503300021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Turtles are excellent models for the study of developmental instability because anomalies are easily detected in the form of malformations, additions, or reductions in the number of scutes or scales. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we integrated field observations, manipulative experiments, and climatic and genetic approaches to investigate the origin of carapace scute anomalies across Iberian populations of the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis. The proportion of anomalous individuals varied from 3% to 69% in local populations, with increasing frequency of anomalies in northern regions. We found no significant effect of climatic and soil moisture, or climatic temperature on the occurrence of anomalies. However, lower genetic diversity and inbreeding were good predictors of the prevalence of scute anomalies among populations. Both decreasing genetic diversity and increasing proportion of anomalous individuals in northern parts of the Iberian distribution may be linked to recolonization events from the Southern Pleistocene refugium. Conclusions/Significance: Overall, our results suggest that developmental instability in turtle carapace formation might be caused, at least in part, by genetic factors, although the influence of environmental factors affecting the developmental stability of turtle carapace cannot be ruled out. Further studies of the effects of environmental factors, pollutants and heritability of anomalies would be useful to better understand the complex origin of anomalies in natural populations.",,,,,"Becker, C.

We investigated the swimming behavior of eight adult Weddell seals, which are proficient divers, in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. A newly developed data logger was attached to free-ranging females at their own breeding sites to record swimming speed, depth, two-dimensional accelerations (stroke frequency and body angle) and temperature. All seals conducted multiple deep dives (the mean dive depth range for each animal was 223.3 +/- 66.5-297.9 +/- 164.7 m). Prolonged gliding while descending was observed with thinner females (N=5 seals). But the fatter females (N=3 seals) exhibited only swim and-glide swimming, characterized by intermittent stroking and fluctuating swim speed, throughout their descent and ascent. The body angles of four of the seals were restricted to less than 30degrees by the location of breathing holes in the ice and the slope of local bathymetric features. Of these four, the three fatter seals adopted the stroke-and-glide method while the other thinner seal descended with prolonged periods of gliding. Prolonged gliding seems to be a more efficient method for locomotion because the surface time between dives of gliding seals was significantly less than that of stroking animals, despite their same stroke frequencies.",,,,,"Mitani, Yoko/D-5779-2012","Mitani, Yoko/0000-0002-7420-0596",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,MAY,2003,206,9,,,,,1461,1470,,10.1242/jeb.00265,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.00265,,,,,,,,12654885,,,,,WOS:000182804100013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increments in the abundance of larvae were closely related with the spawning periods of Mytilus galloprovincialis and with the rise in water temperature (spring to summer). Post-larvae were found in plankton from the intertidal mussel beds, from late summer to early autumn, specially in the intertidal zone of exposed rocky shores (1.2 x 10(3) m(-3)).

The objective of this work was to evaluate the physiological responses of photosynthesis in black pepper plants under different shade levels promoted by intercropping with rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex A. Juss.) MOIL Arg. The photosynthetic performance in black pepper along the day was evaluated under full sun and five shade levels. The resulted showed that variations positives in leaf gas exchanges were not exclusively dependent on the shade promoted by the distance in relation with the line of rubber trees in the field, but also fluctuate depending on the period of the day, the orientation (Northern or Southern), relating the line of trees and the season of the year. This study showed that shaded intercropped plants displayed some advantage in a few cases (black pepper plants located at 2 m, and 5 m between rubber trees, southern side) as regards the photosynthetic rate at midday and afternoon, and especially in summer, when compared to pepper plants cultivated in full sunlight condition, That would be likely related to the to the maintenance of somewhat lower temperature and higher relative humidity in the atmosphere close to the black pepper plant implying some advantage for such consortium system to mitigate the possible effects of future climate changes, like warming.",,,,,"Ramalho, José C/G-2427-2014; Partelli, Fábio Luiz/G-4266-2012","Ramalho, José C/0000-0002-7639-7214; Partelli, Fábio Luiz/0000-0002-8830-0846",,,,,,,,,,,,,1413-7054,1981-1829,,,,SEP-OCT,2018,42,5,,,,,513,526,,10.1590/1413-70542018425020418,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1413-70542018425020418,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000455043000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify the reproductive output and productivity of multiple cultivation cycles of the asexually reproducing Ulva sp. 3 seeded onto ropes using the harvested biomass of each cycle as the seedstock for each successive generation. The seedstock of three independent collections was assessed across multiple asexual generations in outdoor culture to investigate generational and environmental effects. This study, for the first time, has demonstrated that Ulva sp. 3 can be cultivated successfully over multiple (up to seven) successive generations and highlighted the importance of generational and environmental effects. Notably, there was an order of a magnitude decrease in reproductive output and greater than 4-fold decrease in biomass productivity across generations, while the decrease across cultivation cycles was more pronounced with a greater than 20-fold decrease in reproductive output and an order of a magnitude decrease in biomass productivity.

Under global change, the responses of root traits in climate sensitive ecosystems, e.g. high-elevation and cold Alpine ecosystems, remain unclear. To identify how climatic fluctuations drive the variations in the root traits in a Tibetan alpine grassland, we intensively investigated the temporal dynamic of root traits by biweekly measuring root length, root biomass and specific root length for three continuous years. The SRL showed strong seasonal patterns across three years, which did not support SRL considered as a constant in previous root system modeling, while as hypothesized, mean SRL in non-growing seasons was significantly higher than that in growing seasons by 17 %. The accumulative air temperature of growing or non-growing season exerted synchronic effects on the changes in root traits. Nevertheless, precipitation was observed to have the lag effects on root traits, showing that January-April accumulative precipitation was a major driver for the variations in the root length and root biomass respectively peaking in July and June each year. Distinguishingly, root length relied on the lag effect of precipitation; however, for root biomass, the continuous accumulative precipitation together with peak month, i.e. the January-June accumulative precipitation, was also significantly vital.

During each season, the composition of substrates was slightly modified by the accumulation of sand and silt. The trays also had high retention, especially during spring when CPOM dominated the accumulated POM. FPOM was dominant during the other seasons. The MacArthur-Wilson equilibrium model described the colonization during each season by revealing the differences in both the colonization rate and the number of colonizing taxa, suggesting there were seasonal equilibrium values in examined macrozoobenthos parameters. Colonization was fastest during autumn and summer and slowest during spring, probably resulting from important physical parameters, such as temperature, but also influenced by macrofauna life histories. Colonization in spring is suggested to be complex due to insect emergence patterns and high fluctuations in POM. Different seasonal colonization potentials of some abundant taxa were evident from their colonization curves. Overall, shredders dominated functional organization during spring and summer, while scrapers dominated assemblages in autumn and winter, suggesting a seasonal shift in the relative importance among trophic groups. Shredders and collector-gatherers were initial colonizers, followed by collector-filterers, and then predators and scrapers.

A differential global positioning system receiver and a global positioning system compass were used as navigation sensors. The airboat was designed for automatic operation. Using the boat, parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, turbidity and chlorophyll-a of the water were measured in a 26-ha mire pool in Hokkaido, Japan. To determine the appropriate sampling-grid size, 10-m spacing linear sampling was conducted, and the spatial variability of the mire pool characteristics was determined using a semivariogram. Results from the spherical model fit to the empirical semivariogram revealed spatial fluctuations in the water-quality parameters on the scale of 100-140 m. Because the size of the grid must be smaller than this scale, a second survey of water samples in the pool was carried out using a grid size of 40 m x 40 m. At each target point, a water-quality sensor unit was lowered from the boat. The survey of the entire grid area took approximately 231 min, during which time 130 points were sampled. The precision of the sampling points was within 2.6 m. The maximum speed and yaw rate of the airboat were 1.2 m s(-1) and 48 degrees s(-1), respectively.

Nutrient enrichment in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) is a major surface water issue and is suggested as a possible cause of symptoms of ecological degradation. In 2005-06, water samples were collected weekly from seven sites along Ten Mile Creek (TMC), which drains into the Indian River Lagoon, to investigate and analyze spatial and temporal fluctuations of nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The objective of this study was to understand the relationships among chlorophyll a concentration, nutrient enrichment and hydrological parameters in the surface water body. High median concentrations of total P (TP, 0.272 mg L-1), PO4-P (0.122 mg L-1), and dissolved total P (DTP, 0.179 mg L-1); and total N(TN, 0.988 mg L-1), NO3-- N (0.104 mg L-1), NH4+-N (0.103 mg L-1), and total Kjeldahl N (TKN, 0.829 mg L-1), were measured in TMC. The concentrations of TP, PO4-P, DTP, TN, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and TKN were higher in summer and fall than in winter and spring. However, chlorophyll a and pheophytin concentrations during this period in TMC varied in the range of 0.000-60.7 and 0.000-17.4 mg L-1, with their median values of 3.54 and 3.02 mg L-1, respectively. The greatest mean chlorophyll a (10.3 mg L-1) and pheophytin (5.71 mg L-1) concentrations occurred in spring, while the lowest chlorophyll a (1.49 mg L-1) and pheophytin (1.97 mu g L-1) in fall. High concentrations of PO4-P (>0.16 mg L-1), DTP (> 0.24 mg L-1), NO3--N (> 0.15 mg L-1), NH4+-N (> 0.12 mg L-1), and TKN (> 0.96 mg L-1), occurred in the upstream of TMC, while high concentrations of chlorophyll a (> 6.8 mg L-1) and pheophytin (> 3.9 mg L-1) were detected in the downstream of TMC. The highest chlorophyll a (11.8 mg L-1) and pheophytin (6.06 mg L-1) concentrations, however, were associated with static and open water conditions. Hydrological parameters (total dissolved solid, electrical conductivity, salinity, pH, and water temperature) were positively correlated with chlorophyll a and pheophytin concentrations (P < 0.01) and these factors overshadowed the relationships between N and P concentrations and chlorophyll a under field conditions.

J,"Green, ME",,,,"Green, ME",,,A resonance model gives the response to membrane potential for an ion channel,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The current-voltage curve for ion channels is perhaps the best known characteristic of these channels. One of the first properties measured, it is accurately known for a variety of channels. The curve is usually described by a single thermal activation energy, which is assumed to show the number of channels opening in response to a voltage step. Activation allows movement of charges as the membrane depolarizes; the putative number of charges moving to open the channel is a parameter estimated from the curve. As the activation energy, E, creates a probability dependent on exp(radical anion E/(B)T) (k(B)T = Boltzmann's constant x temperature) for a given channel to reach the open state, the opening probability distribution is referred to as a Boltzmann curve. The Boltzmann calculation of the complete curve is consistent with the experimental results on the i-V curve. However, other experimental data are not so easily explained by a Boltzmann curve, and there exists an alternative. A calculation based on the assumption of a threshold potential, which, if passed, allows a channel to open, leads to an open probability vs. potential curve which is also consistent with the measured current vs. voltage curve over its entire voltage range. The calculation assumes fluctuations in the local environment, leading to a distribution of the potential at which channels cross the threshold. There is a physical mechanism which would account for such a threshold, tunneling of a proton as the mechanism of charge movement. Actually, two or more almost independent tunneling transitions are required to obtain agreement with experiment, but this changes no essential feature of the model. Because tunneling requires matching of energy levels in two wells, it is appropriately referred to as a resonance. This model also makes it possible to explain an additional experiment: Folhmeister & Adelman (1985a, b, 1986) have shown that a sinusoidal potential added to the membrane potential produces second harmonics of the sinusoidal frequency in the output current. Similar response to a sinusoidal input is found from the model, and compared qualitatively to the published experimental results of Fohlmeister & Adelman. A time delay can also be introduced between reaching the threshold and channel opening, which is both physically necessary and necessary for agreement with experiment. Unlike the Boltzmann model, our model agrees (qualitatively) with their experiment. We have tested two distributions of states as a function of potential: Gaussian, and skewed Gaussian (similar to V(2) exp(- aV(2)), V = potential). The latter comes closer to representing both the open probability-potential curve and the Fohlmeister & Adelman results, although the pure Gaussian is still better than the Boltzmann model.

Surprisingly, many sessile species that seemingly have limited potential to disperse often rapidly colonize areas that have been recently disturbed. The synchronous release of propagules during periods that promote advection may extend the dispersal of such species and promote their rapid colonization. Alternatively, rapid recovery may result from colonization by dormant stages that survive disturbance. Here we test for reproductive synchrony as a way of extending the dispersal potential of two common seaweeds, the kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica. Synchrony in spore release in their case is likely to be particularly useful in extending colonization distance because fertilization in these species occurs after spore dispersal; synchrony increases the chance of fertilization by increasing the concentration of spores. We also evaluate experimentally the relative importance of dormant stages vs. recently settled spores in accounting for the rapid recovery of local kelp populations following severe disturbances. Reproductive synchrony was evaluated by following weekly changes in the reproductive condition of adult kelp. The degree of reproductive synchrony in both Macrocystis and Pterygophora was significantly greater than that expected under conditions of asynchronous reproduction. In Macrocystis, periods of synchronous spore production and release occurred sporadically over a 2-yr period. At least 75% of the sampled population exhibited the same directional change in reproductive condition in 38 of 82 sample periods. Episodes of significant spore release varied in duration from as little as 1 wk to as much as 2 mo. The sharpest decline in reproductive condition occurred during a severe storm. In contrast to Macrocystis, relatively well defined cycles of spore production, maturation, and release were observed in Pterygophora. More than one cycle was observed within a single reproductive season, and each cycle lasted similar to 3-4 wk. The different patterns and degrees of synchrony observed between the two species likely reflect the degree to which their production of spores is influenced by environmental conditions; spore production in Macrocystis is greatly influenced by fluctuations in seawater temperature and nutrients while spore production in Pterygophora is not. Results from field experiments comparing the recruitment of small plants among rocks placed in the kelp bed for varying lengths of time indicated that microscopic life stages of Macrocystis and Pterygophora have little capacity for dormancy, and that the vast majority of recruitment resulted from recently settled spores. These results contrasted with those observed for the annual brown alga Desmarestia ligulata which showed a dormancy period of several months. Our findings suggest that mechanisms such as reproductive synchrony that extend the distances over which kelp spores can effectively colonize are likely to play a critical role in the dynamics of kelp populations, which often fluctuate greatly in time due to disturbance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,DEC,1997,78,8,,,,,2443,2457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997YK72600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

We conducted experiments in three fallow paddy fields situated on the alluvial Echigo Plain in central Japan with an aim to restore the habitat of native wetland plant species. The three experimental fields were managed under different irrigation regimes, (1) perennially flooded with water, (2) intermittent irrigation, and (3) temporary irrigation. Half the area of each experimental field was tilled before irrigation. Detrended correspondence analysis revealed obvious floristic differences between experimental and control fields with no irrigation. The proportion of wetland plant species in the experimental fields increased corresponding to the irrigation period, ranging 60-86%, and was relatively greater than that in control fields. In the experimental fields, differences in both tillage and irrigation affected the occurrence of plant species. Tillage restricted the occurrence of many non-wetland plant species, and had a positive effect on the establishment of several annual wetland plant species. In addition, a longer duration of irrigation is not necessarily suitable for the occurrence of all wetland plant species.

Different from DO in flowing water area, the dynamics of DO in a crab pond is deeply affected by complex interactions between organism communities and meteorological factors. Significant fluctuations of DO content occurs within 24 h. It is thus important to explore DO dynamics related to various environmental factors for real time DO content prediction, water quality analysis, and artificial aeration control. In this work, a dynamic model based on the diffusion theory was developed to reflect daily variations of DO content at different depths in a crab pond. The model focuses on evaluating the effects of macrophyte and aerator on the production of DO, and the effects of extinction coefficient and diffusion coefficient on the vertical distribution of DO. Photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic macrophyte, mechanical aeration, mineralization, and meteorological conditions were considered. The model can fit experiment data with mean absolute percentage error about 6%. Simulation results show that the main process that produces DO in the pond is photosynthesis of macrophyte, which accounts for 88.2% of the DO source. Mechanical aeration adds 9.2% of DO while reaeration adds 2.6% of DO. The main process that consumes DO is mineralization which accounts for 86.9% DO sink, followed by respiration of macrophyte which utilizes 13.1% DO, the effect of crabs on DO content is small. DO at different depths was also simulated, and it can be found that hypoxia is more likely to occur in the bottom water where diffusion coefficient decreases.

Four mortality scenarios were compared for each population: (1) constant mortality (estimated from catch-at-age data); (2) length-dependent mortality; (3) growth-dependent mortality; and (4) combined length- and growth-dependent mortality. Scenarios 2,3, and 4 were parameterized to achieve the final survival produced by the constant mortality rates estimated from observations (scenario 1). Scenario 2 accounted well for declining mortality with size but not for the large variations in growth-dependent mortality. Scenario 3 failed to capture the decreasing vulnerability of surviving larvae to predation. Only scenario 4 accounted for both the large fluctuations in growth-dependent mortality and the progressive shift in dominance from length-dependent to growth-dependent mortality as the survivors increased in size. Sub-sampling the model output to reproduce the limited temporal resolution of sampling at sea improved the fit between observed and modeled frequencies-at-age, and pointed to the under-sampling of the smallest larvae as a major sampling bias.

Such nychthemeral variations have been documented for insect inducible immunity (responsiveness to microbial challenge), while the existence of similar daily patterns in basal immunity remains unexplored. Basal immunity is defined as the background, readily available protection aimed at preventing infection at any time. Daily rhythmic elevation of basal immunity should bear substantial costs and be performed only when facing highly predictable changes in threat of infection. This could be the case for risk of food-borne infection, presumably fluctuating with daily patterns of host feeding activity. This study investigated the existence of day/night variations in feeding activity and basal immunity, using larvae of the moth Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) raised under a realistic daily cycle of light and temperature conditions. At night, larvae (i) spent a greater amount of time feeding, (ii) displayed a higher total phenoloxidase activity and (iii) underwent subtle changes in the balance of some haemocyte types newly described for this species (increase in the relative abundances of prohaemocytes and plasmatocytes, decrease in the one of oenocytoids). These data provide the first evidence of nychthemeral variations of basal immunity in an insect model, with peaks in some immune effectors co-occurring with maximal feeding activity (during nighttime).

Many studies have also considered accumulation of Si as a process controlled by geo-hydrological factors. To test these ideas, we investigated the relationship between concentration of Si in fibrous tussock sedge (Carex appropinquata) and the population density of a major sedge consumer, the root vole (Microtus oeconomus), in field enclosures in natural habitat under a variety of natural water regimes and weather conditions. We found that a high density of voles at the end of summer resulted in the immediate accumulation of Si by rhizomes, followed by accumulation of Si in leaves with a 1-year lag time. The level of river flooding in the same year had an additional impact on Si concentration in rhizomes but did not affect silicification of leaves. Overwinter changes in concentration of Si in sedges were influenced by fluctuations in ambient temperature and the depth of snow cover (multiple freeze-thaw cycles), thus affecting the quality of winter food available for voles. Smaller voles had lower mortality during early winter than large voles, which seemed to be connected with changes in the quality of the autumn rather than the winter food base. Winter survival of voles was not associated with Si concentration in their faeces, however. Our results suggest that changes in Si concentration in fibrous tussock sedge can be induced by changes in vole population density and are also additionally affected by the amount of flooding and weather conditions.",,,,,"Konarzewski, Marek/AAR-9952-2020; Zub, Karol/ABG-4802-2020","Konarzewski, Marek/0000-0001-7428-6521; Zub, Karol/0000-0001-7235-2206; Szafranska, Paulina/0000-0001-7914-5664; Ksiazek, Aneta/0000-0003-1796-9005",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,FEB,2015,29,2,,,,,187,194,,10.1111/1365-2435.12327,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12327,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000350051900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Patterns of softening of seeds from the same seed populations were also determined in a laboratory oven with a diurnal temperature fluctuation of 60/15-degrees-C. In the field, the softening rates of the 5 medics grown at Merredin were similar, averaging 21% of the original seeds each year for the first 4 ears. Seeds of the burr medic grown in a more favourable environment at Eneabba were much slower to soften (averaging 14%); hence, hardseededness in these medics was influenced more by the growing environment than by genotype. More than half of the seeds of subterranean clover softened in the field over the first summer, with declining annual proportions thereafter. There were clear differences between the clover and medics in both pattern and rate of seed softening. The lower seed-softening rate of medics than of subterranean clover was more favourable for ley systems involving frequent cropping, especially in low rainfall areas.

In some areas this has therefore led to wide agricultural abandonment. However, studies on the effect of agricultural abandonment as a potential restoration tool are lacking. In this study, the effectiveness and the restoration potential of agricultural abandonment in reducing peat degradation and in improving soil microbial biodiversity were evaluated. The main chemical parameters, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity and soil respiration partitioning were used to assess the long-term effect of 15 years of agricultural abandonment (Aband) in a Mediterranean reclaimed peatland. An intensive maize cultivation (Cult) in the same area was used as a comparison. Multivariate analyses showed that 15 years of agricultural abandonment: did not affect the main soil chemical parameters, except for NH4+ which was lower in the Aband than in the Cult; increased AM fungal root colonization and the diversity in terms of number of families of AM fungi retrieved in roots, but decreased soil AM fungal richness; reduced total soil respiration and its autotrophic component but increased respiration by heterotrophs; determined a lower fluctuation of soil CO2 flux response to air temperature than the Cult. Thus, although some soil quality parameters were significantly improved, 15 years of agricultural abandonment may not lead to an effective restoration. Consequently, alternative and sustainable solutions for the protection and preservation of Mediterranean peatlands need to be developed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Results of this study have shown that the poultry + yard trimmings compost went through physico-chemical and biochemical changes during composting. These changes included self-heating of the compost mass, relative increases in enzyme activities, decreases in water-soluble components (i.e. water-extractable C, inorganic N, and heavy metal contents), and elimination of phytotoxicity. An overall increase in enzyme activity was observed over the course of the present experiment. Alkaline and acid phosphatase, and leucine amino-peptidase activities were high, while lipase, esterase, and esterase activities were moderate at the beginning of composting. Cystine amino peptidase, chymotrypsin, and trypsin showed no evidence of activity during the entire period of composting. Of the eight glycosyl-hydrolases, only alpha -galactosidase, beta -glucosidase, and N-acetyl-beta glucosaminidase showed any significant activity, fluctuating between low and moderate activity. The activity of sc-mannosidase was low while beta -galactosidase. beta -glucuronidase, and alpha -fucosidase remained undetected during the entire testing period). Although this enzyme test is rather preliminary, the results of this study seem to show potential usefulness of enzyme activity measurements as indices of the course of the actual composting.

In particular, current velocities and light intensity may strongly regulate the supply and demand of inorganic carbon (Ci) as substrates for photosynthesis. Macrocystis pyrifera can acquire and utilize both CO2 and bicarbonate (HCO3-) as Ci substrates for photosynthesis and growth. Given the variability in carbon delivery (due to current velocities and varying [DIC]) and demand (in the form of saturating irradiance), we hypothesized that the proportion of CO2 and bicarbonate utilized is not constant for M. pyrifera, but a variable function of their fluctuating environment. We further hypothesized that populations acclimated to different wave exposure and irradiance habitats would display different patterns of bicarbonate uptake. To test these hypotheses, we carried out oxygen evolution trials in the laboratory to measure the proportion of bicarbonate utilized by M. pyrifera via external CA under an orthogonal cross of velocity, irradiance, and acclimation treatments. Our Monterey Bay populations of M. pyrifera exhibited proportionally higher external bicarbonate utilization in high irradiance and high flow velocity conditions than in sub-saturating irradiance or low flow velocity conditions. However, there was no significant difference in proportional bicarbonate use between deep blades and canopy blades, nor between individuals from wave-exposed versus waveprotected sites.

J,"Locke, AM; Ort, DR",,,,"Locke, Anna M.; Ort, Donald R.",,,Diurnal depression in leaf hydraulic conductance at ambient and elevated [CO2] reveals anisohydric water management in field-grown soybean and possible involvement of aquaporins,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Diurnal cycles of photosynthesis and water use in field-grown soybean (Glycine max) are tied to light intensity and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). At high mid-day VPD, transpiration rates can lead to a decline in leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)) if leaf hydraulic conductance (K-leaf) is insufficient to supply water to intercellular airspaces in pace with demand. K-leaf is determined by leaf xylem conductivity to water, as well as extra-xylem pathways that are likely mediated by aquaporin water transport proteins. When transpiration demand exceeds the maximum capacity of K-leaf to supply water, high tension in the water column can cause cavitation in xylem, and these emboli-blocked xylem vessels reduce water transport and thus lower K-leaf. Stomatal conductance typically remains high at mid-day for soybean, suggesting either a mid-day increase in K-leaf or that photosynthesis may be maintained at the cost of leaf water status, indicative of an anisohydric water management strategy in soybean. This study examined diurnal fluctuations in K-leaf and Psi(leaf), showing a mid-day depression in K-leaf in a pattern closely reflecting that of Psi(leaf), indicating that K-leaf depression is the result of cavitation in leaf xylem. The diurnal depression of K-leaf was not prevented by growth at elevated [CO2], which lowered stomatal conductance. Diurnal transcription patterns of aquaporin genes showed that a total of 34 genes belonging to 4 aquaporin families were expressed in soybean leaves, of which 22 were differentially expressed between at least two time points. These data suggest that mid-day K-leaf depression was driven primarily by cavitation at increasing xylem water tensions, but that aquaporins are also likely involved in diurnal regulation of soybean leaf water status. It is further concluded that because soybean photosynthesis is typically sustained at mid-day, K-leaf even at the depressed level was in excess of that needed to sustain a stomatal conductance sufficient to prevent depression of photosynthesis in soybean.

These flux measurements are very labor-and time-intensive, requiring three to four gas samples collected over a 30 to 60 min period, followed by laboratory N2O measurement with a gas chromatograph (GC) and subsequent flux rate calculation. The objective of this research was to develop and evaluate improved, real-time flux chamber designs that rapidly quantify N2O emissions from manure and soil. The first chamber system consisted of six square 0.95 m(2) chamber pans. The chamber pans were mounted on a rail system to facilitate controlled indoor/outdoor laboratory research at a pilot scale. An aluminum lid was moved among the chamber pans. A second portable chamber system with a circular footprint (0.49 m internal dia.) was designed for use in field measurements. With both systems, N2O concentrations were measured each second with 0.1 ppb resolution by recirculating sample air through a real-time continuous N2O analyzer with return flow into the recirculating-flow-through (RFT-NSS) chamber. Performance and observational data are presented for different chamber vent designs, sealing mechanisms between the chamber pan and lid, recirculation pumps, and presence/absence of an internal fan that mixes headspace air within the sealed chamber. As examples of the repeatability and precision of the methodology, ten consecutive flux measurements were obtained using moist manure (32.6% wet basis water content, WCWB) within a 15 min period in which chamber pans were fitted with lids for 60 s and removed for 30 s. The mean calculated N2O flux was 43.08 +/- 0.89 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1). Using dry manure (WCWB = 10.8%), five consecutive flux measurements showed a very low, but consistent, flux that averaged 0.025 +/- 0.0016 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1). Five case study experiments demonstrate the usefulness of these chamber systems and highlight discoveries and lessons learned to enhance future research efforts. Major discoveries and observations include: (1) installation of a small internal fan within the chamber lids decreased N2O fluctuation over small time periods, allowing precise measurement of manure N2O fluxes as low as 0.0073 mg N2O m(-2) h(-1) during a 60 s measurement period; (2) two distinct N2O peaks were observed at 1 and 21 d following the addition of water to manure (initial WCWB = 32.6%), with the second peak accounting for 83% of the total N2O emitted over 45 d; and (3) there was notable diurnal variation in N2O fluxes due to temperature variation, even when the manure was dry (WCWB = 10.8%). These flux chamber systems proved to be more rapid, precise, and repeatable than traditional flux chamber methods and offer promise for future greenhouse gas emissions research on manure and soil.",,,,,"Meyer, Beverly/GMX-3358-2022; Todd, Robert/GWM-4486-2022; Casey, Kenneth/F-4409-2010","Meyer, Beverly/0000-0003-3934-6386; Casey, Kenneth/0000-0003-0819-8376; Parker, David/0000-0003-3852-0880; Waldrip, Heidi/0000-0001-7714-5417",,,,,,,,,,,,,2151-0032,2151-0040,,,,,2017,60,4,,,,,1235,1258,,10.13031/trans.12151,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/trans.12151,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000408589300018,View Full Record in Web of Science

This results in changes of soil microbial biomass and disruption of important biological processes. Although in general not recommended (Anderson, 1987), soil samples are often stored after sampling and before analyses, as for various reasons they cannot be processed immediately. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of soil storage on microbial biomass and its activities. Soils were sampled in several sites in the Czech Republic, mostly from plots of long-term field experiments (soils Jaro, Lipa, Luka, Iva) or from ordinary fields (soils from Netrebice and Chelcice). Microbial biomass, bazal and glucose-induced respirations and nitrifying activity were determined using standard methods; the results are expressed per gram of dry soil. As shown in Fig. 1, storage of most soils at 4 +/- 2 degrees C influenced microbial biomass. After one week storage, both increase and decrease of microbial biomass were recorded. During further storage (after 18 as well as 60 weeks) decrease of microbial biomass was found. However, only small fluctuations of microbial biomass but large increases of bazal respiration were found in soil stored at constant moisture at laboratory conditions (18 to 25 degrees C) for 56 weeks (Tab. I). Microbial biomass in air-dried soil first increased, but then decreased, while bazal respiration was slightly increased (Tab. II). Glucose-induced respiration fluctuated at the beginning of soil storage at 4 +/- 2 degrees C and decreased later on (Fig. 2). Nitrifying enzyme activity was determined in refrigerated (4 +/- 2 degrees C) as well, as in frozen (-20 degrees C) soils, the latter defrosted quickly (2 hours) and/or slowly (2 days) before the measurements. As shown in Fig. 3, it was enhanced in soils after 2 and 11 weeks of storage at 4 +/- 2 degrees C. When the frozen soils were defrosted quickly, the activity was significantly lower, while in soils defrosted slowly it was significantly higher in comparison with soils stored at 4 +/- 2 degrees C. The results showed that microbial biomass and its activities can be substantially changed during the storage of soils after sampling. It was also found that various soils (that is soils from different sites or differently fertilized soils) can respond differently. It is likely that after sampling there is a few days' fluctuation period of control and regulatory factors, which is then reflected in fluctuation of microbial biomass and activities. Although Stenberg et al. (1998) recommend freezing when soils are to be stored, our results show that microbial activities in defrosted soils can be substantially changed. When processing freezed soils, the critical step is defreezing. We suggest that refrigeration of soils at about 4 degrees C is the most careful mode of storage but not even in this case uncontrolled changes in soils can be excluded.",,,,,"Šimek, Miloslav/G-1532-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0370-663X,,,,,SEP,1999,45,9,,,,,415,419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000084570100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Strain information is derived from a set of 9000 CTD profiles from the surface to 560-m depth, obtained from the Research Platform FLIP in the 1986 PATCHEX Experiment. Four hundred isopycnals, with mean vertical separation DELTA-zBAR = 1 m, were tracked for the 19-day duration of the experiment. The instantaneous separation, DELTA-z(t), between isopycnal pairs is found to bc statistically independent of the mean position of the pair. The separation statistics demonstrate a number of the characteristic features of a Poisson process. If the number of isopycnals found in a given fixed-depth interval is simply tallied from profile to profile, the variability in the count, when properly rescaled, is given by a Poisson distribution. Probability density functions (pdfs) of separation are well described by the classical Gamma family. A simple mechanistic model of the strain field is proposed as a guide for interpreting the Poisson-like observations. The model approximates the vertical profile of a passive scalar quantity as a series of constant gradient segments. The depth bounds of each segment are governed by Poisson statistics. Curiously, the strain variance is not an adjustable parameter in this model. The strain variance is 0.5 when statistics are collected in an Eulerian frame. Variance has value unity if the statistics are accumulated in an isopycnal-following frame. The model vertical wavenumber spectrum of strain is a function of a single parameter, the Poisson scale constant kappa-0. For kappa-0 = 1.1 m-1, consistent with the observations, the spectrum has k0 form at low wavenumber. Spectral form transitions to a almost-equal-to k-1.5 slope at vertical scales smaller than about 10 m. In contrast to spectral models based on linear dynamics, here the form of the spectrum is constrained to change with changing energy density. Also, skewness, kurtosis, and higher moments of the strain process can be inferred from observations of the second moment. The moments of inverse separation, DELTA-z-1, are useful in predicting fluctuations in the vertical gradients of passive scalar quantities theta(z): partial derivative-theta/partial derivative z = (theta(rho-1) - theta(rho-2)) . DELTA-z-1. A family of probability density functions (pdfs) of vertical gradients is presented as a function of the vertical differencing interval DELTA-zBAR. Using the single variable kappa-0 = 1.1 m-1 from PATCHEX, the model pdfs of gradients compare excellently with temperature gradient data obtained by Gregg in the central Pacific in 1977. Small but significant discrepancies appear between the observations and the idealized Poisson model. These are ascribed to the tendency of isopycnals to gather into a sheets and layer configuration. When a number of isopycnals gather into a thin sheet, the chances of finding successive isopycnals in the adjoining water (layer) is reduced. A weak predictive ability is implied that is inconsistent with a Poisson process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,1520-0485,,,,JUL,1992,22,7,,,,,773,795,,10.1175/1520-0485(1992)022<0773:TASDOF>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(1992)022<0773:TASDOF>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JC52100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Grain yields (t.ha(-1)), thousand-kernel weight - TKW (g), bulk weight - OH (g/l) and proportion of grain above sieves 2.5 and 2.2 (%) including minus mesh material were evaluated the trial. Results showed that the total average yields of grain bf the above-mentioned cultivars (Tab. II in) soil cultivation by rotary (variant II) and disc tools (variant III) were fluctuating at the same level. Statistically significantly lowest grain yields were recorded in traditional soil cultivation - medium-deep tillage (minimal significant difference DT0.01 = 0.151). The highest grain yield for the studied three-year experimental period was reached by the Viginta cultivar (7.06 t.ha(-1)). A different response of cultivars to different intensity of soil cultivation was recorded in this connection. The Danubia cultivar reached the highest grain yield in the variant III (soil cultivation by disc tools), in the Viginta cultivar the differences between variants II and III (soil cultivation by rotary and disc tools) were minimum in the grain yields (on average only 0.07 t.ha(-1)), in the Zdar cultivar the highest grain yields were recorded in rotary soil cultivation. It is evident in view of this that the grain yields obtained in variant I (medium-deep tillage) were the lowest in all three variants (Tab. III). In thousand-kernel weight (TKW), in similar way as in other studied indicators of the grain quality (bulk density and proportion of grains above sieves 2.5 and 2.2 mm), solely statistically effect of the year was recorded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0370-663X,,,,,,1993,39,10,,,,,895,902,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993MH47900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The evolution of turbulence and mixing were examined by simultaneously mapping the velocity (u, w) and density fields (p) and the vertical mass flux F(=($) over bar p ($) over bar w/p'w') together with flow visualization in a low-noise water tunnel. Buoyancy was induced by salinity differences so the value of the Schmidt number S-c = 700. Density stratification altered the inertial-buoyancy force balance (most simply expressed by Nt, the product of the buoyancy frequency N and turbulent timescale t) so as to attenuate turbulent velocity fluctuations, vertical motions and interfacial convolutions, normalized density fluctuations, vertical flux mass, and mean interfacial thickness. Vertical velocity fluctuations w' were found to increase with distance from the interface, whereas the u'-distribution can be non-monotonic. The maximum value of the mass flux, IF, was found to be about 0.5 which was less than the typical value of 0.7 for thermally stratified wind tunnel experiments for which S-c = 0.7. The vertical mass flux can be a combination of down-gradient and counter-gradient transport with the ratio varying with Nt (e.g. at Nt approximate to 5, the flux is counter-gradient).

Across the boreal forest biome, climate change threatens to either alter rates of annual precipitation or skew the timing and ratio of rainfall and snowfall events. To simulate moisture variability during the ice-free season, cylindrical mesocosms (diameter 1.5 m) were installed in a southern boreal patterned fen in central Saskatchewan, Canada, to enable manipulations of antecedent snow conditions. The objectives of the study were to assess the utility of in situ mesocosms for peatland ecohydrology research and to test for effects of snow manipulations on fen plant communities. After spring thaw, initial water depths were greatest and dates of surface water disappearance were latest in the snow addition mesocosms, followed by the control and snow removal mesocosms. In contrast, maximum frost levels and frost disappearance dates in the snow addition mesocosms were intermediate to those of the control and snow removal mesocosms. Densification of snow during snow manipulation events is suggested to account for this confounding outcome. Of the nine plant taxa identified in the harvests of aboveground biomass from all mesocosms, buckbean (Menyanthes trifoliata) biomass was most strongly related to variation in surface water conditions.

An average grower's N rate currently exceeds the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF-IFAS) recommendation (224 kg N ha(-1) maximum). Excess nutrients are subject to runoff and leaching, which raises environmental concerns in Florida watersheds. A field study was conducted to elucidate N spatial distribution in tomato beds during the 2006 spring and winter growing seasons with 224 and 358 kg N ha(-1) rates. Ammonium N was highest for both seasons during 0 to 1 wk after planting (WAP) at the 0- to 10-cm depth in the fertilizer band, but rarely moved vertically. Lateral movement of NH4+-N was observed through 7 WAP, however, probably due to diffusion. Nitrate N at 0 to 10 cm in the band peaked during 3 to 4 WAP, indicating about 3 wk of nitrification in the spring; however, this process was shortened to 1 to 2 wk in the winter, probably due to greater bacterial activity with warmer temperatures in the beginning of the winter than the spring (average 8 C in the first 3 wk). Both lateral and vertical movements of NO3--N were observed in the spring, even at the 20- to 30-cm depth. A rise and subsequent fall of the water table level during 5 to 8 WAP particularly enhanced NO3--N downward movement, which was attributed to greater diffusivity of NO3--N than NH4+-N. Minimizing water table fluctuations and applying a reduced N rate are critical to reduce NO3--N leaching loss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0361-5995,1435-0661,,,,MAY-JUN,2009,73,3,,,,,1044,1052,,10.2136/sssaj2008.0206,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2008.0206,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000265621900038,View Full Record in Web of Science

High tunnel and field production methods were trialed in North Logan, UT (41.77 degrees N, 111.81 degrees W, 1382 m elevation) with cultivars 'Chantilly', 'Potomac', and 'Rocket' in 2018 and 2019. Each year, five to six transplant timings at 3-week intervals were tested, beginning in early February in high tunnels and ending in late May in an unprotected field. Stems were harvested and graded according to quality and stem length. High tunnels advanced production by 5 to 8 weeks, whereas field harvests continued beyond the high tunnel harvests by 2 to 8 weeks. High tunnels yielded 103 to 110 total stems per m(2) (65% to 89% marketability), whereas field yields were 111 to 162 total stems per m(2) (34% to 58% marketability). Overall, production was the greatest with March transplant timings in the high tunnels and mid-April transplant timings in the field. 'Chantilly' consistently bloomed the earliest on 4 and 6 May each year, 'Potomac' had the highest percentage of long stem lengths, and 'Rocket' extended marketable stem production through July in high tunnels.

Because time is constraining, I attempted to determine whether Attwater's prairie chicken are likely to harbor helminthic endoparasites known to cause disease in other grouse so that a more informed decision regarding whether to commit time and other resources to field studies and experimental trials can be made. Using polar ordination, I found a gradient among 10 surveys of helminthic endoparasites of prairie grouse collected from several midcontinental ecoregions of the USA (1931-1977). A regression model including variables representing 1) normal annual precipitation and 2) normal winter (Dec. -Feb.) temperature and the proportion of normal annual precipitation received during the winter could account for this gradient. When meteorological data from areas inhabited by the remaining 3 Attwater's prairie chicken populations were incorporated, the models predicted that Attwater's prairie chicken might be expected to harbor helminthic endoparasite communities similar to those of greater prairie chicken T. c. pinnatus populations surveyed in Illinois, Kansas, and Missouri. Two parasite species associated with disease in North American grouse Dispharynx nasuta, Heterakis gallinarum were found during these studies. Additionally, Attwater's prairie chicken might be expected to maintain parasites not found during any of the surveys I evaluated. This study suggests that it would be worthwhile to survey free-living Attwater's prairie chicken to determine whether individuals harbor helminthic endoparasites shown pathogenic to other grouse species, even if the methodologies employed must be somewhat constrained.",,,,,"Peterson, Markus J/C-3303-2008","Peterson, Markus J/0000-0001-6145-0134",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,,,,,DEC,1996,19,4,,,,,424,431,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1996.tb00253.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1996.tb00253.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VM47200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current and temperature measurements were made with an upward looking acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) located on the 147 m isobath near the shelfbreak and three vertical thermistor moorings located upshelf. Data from the ADCP and two nearby thermistor chains show energetic internal tides propagating at roughly 0.9 m s(-1) to the north-northwest, nearly perpendicular to the local topography with 10-15 cm s(-1) horizontal currents and 15-30 m vertical displacements.

Cross-isobath barotropic tidal currents, responsible for generating the internal tides are in the 5-12 cm s(-1) range. The bore formation is highly variable. There is evidence of a correlation between internal tide steepening and a shelfbreak front jet orientation that is oppositely directed to the internal tide propagation. There is no correlation between steepening and the jet's vertical shear. Statistics of the undular bores show rms travel time fluctuations from 0.8 to 1.7 hours and average tidal bore durations from 12 to 9 hours.

The maximum hearing distance differed between individuals and weather conditions from 1 to 15 m (mean 9.2 m). Although the AN1 activity generally decreased with increasing distance, large fluctuations in the magnitude of responses occurred with distance, indicating that the intensity gradient over distance is often irregular.

In the present paper, data have been collected through an extensive experimental campaign in seven canyons. Then, data driven techniques, to predict the more probable wind speed in deep urban canyons as a function of the prevailing thermal and inertia phenomena, have been developed.

Most often the invalid analysis consists of use of an (n+1)-way anova in a situation where two or more n-way anovas would be the appropriate approach'. I and my students examined a total of 1362 papers published from the 1960s to 2009 reporting manipulative experiments, primarily in the field of ecology. The error was present in 7% of these, including 9% of 80 experimental papers examined in 2009 issues of Ecology and the Journal of Animal Ecology. Key features of 60 cases of pseudofactorialism are tabulated as a basis for discussion of the varied ways and circumstances in which the error can occur. As co-authors, colleagues, editors and anonymous referees and editors who approved them for publication, a total of 459 persons other than the senior authors shared responsibility for these 60 papers. Pseudofactorialism may sometimes be motivated by a desire to test whether different response variables respond in the same way to treatment factors. Proper procedures for doing that are briefly reviewed. A major cause of pseudofactorialism is the widespread failure in statistics texts, primary literature and documentation for statistics software packages to distinguish the three major components of experimental design - treatment structure, design structure, response structure - and clearly define key terms such as experimental unit, evaluation unit, split unit, factorial and repeated measures.

This Account examines recent progress in atomistic simulations of such reactions and the insights provided into mechanisms and interpretation of experiments. Illustrative examples are discussed. The main computational approaches employed are classical trajectory simulations using interaction potentials derived from quantum chemical methods. This comprises both ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and semiempirical molecular dynamics (SEMD), the latter referring to semiempirical quantum chemical methods. Presented examples are as follows: (i) Reaction of the (NO+)(NO3-) ion pair with a water cluster to produce the atmospherically important HONO and HNO3. The simulations show that a cluster with four water molecules describes the reaction. This provides a hydrogen-bonding network supporting the transition state. The reaction is triggered by thermal structural fluctuations, and ultrafast changes in atomic partial charges play a key role. This is an example where a reaction in a small cluster can provide a model for a corresponding bulk process. The results support the proposed mechanism for production of HONO by hydrolysis of NO2 (N2O4). (ii) The reactions of gaseous HCl with N2O4 and N2O5 on liquid water surfaces. Ionization of HCl at the water/air interface is followed by nucleophilic attack of Cl on N2O4 or N2O5. Both reactions proceed by an SN2 mechanism. The products are ClNO and ClNO2, precursors of atmospheric atomic chlorine. Because this mechanism cannot result from a cluster too small for HCl ionization, an extended water film model was simulated. The results explain ClNO formation experiments. Predicted ClNO2 formation is less efficient. (iii) Ionization of acids at ice surfaces. No ionization is found on ideal crystalline surfaces, but the process is efficient on isolated defects where it involves formation of H3O+-acid anion contact ion pairs. This behavior is found in simulations of a model of the ice quasi-liquid layer corresponding to large defect concentrations in crystalline ice. The results are in accord with experiments. (iv) Ionization of acids on wet quartz. A monolayer of water on hydroxylated silica is ordered even at room temperature, but the surface lattice constant differs significantly from that of crystalline ice. The ionization processes of HCl and H2SO4 are of high yield and occur in a few picoseconds. The results are in accord with experimental spectroscopy. (v) Photochemical reactions on water and ice. These simulations require excited state quantum chemical methods. The electronic absorption spectrum of methyl hydroperoxide adsorbed on a large ice cluster is strongly blue-shifted relative to the isolated molecule. The measured and calculated adsorption band low-frequency tails are in agreement. A simple model of photodynamics assumes prompt electronic relaxation of the excited peroxide due to the ice surface. SEMD simulations support this, with the important finding that the photochemistry takes place mainly on the ground state. In conclusion, dynamics simulations using quantum chemical potentials are a useful tool in atmospheric chemistry of water media, capable of comparison with experiment.",,,,,"Shemesh, Dorit/AAC-8007-2020","Shemesh, Dorit/0000-0001-6515-4463; Murdachaew, Garold/0000-0001-6958-6765; Finlayson-Pitts, Barbara/0000-0003-4650-168X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-4842,1520-4898,,,,FEB,2015,48,2,,,,,399,406,,10.1021/ar500431g,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ar500431g,,,,,,,,25647299,,,,,WOS:000349806300026,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Hanazaki, H; Hunt, JCR",,,,"Hanazaki, H; Hunt, JCR",,,Linear processes in unsteady stably stratified turbulence,JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unsteady turbulence in uniformly stratified unsheared flow is analysed using rapid distortion theory (RDT). For inviscid flow with no molecular diffusion the theory shows how the initial conditions, such as the initial turbulent kinetic energy KE(0) and potential energy PE(0), determine the partition of energy between the potential energy associated with density fluctuation and the kinetic energy associated with each of the velocity components during the subsequent development of the turbulence. One parameter is an exception to this sensitivity to initial conditions, namely the limit at large time of the ratio of potential energy to vertical kinetic energy. In the linear theory, this ratio depends neither on the Reynolds number Re, nor the Prandtl number Pr nor the Froude number Pr. This is consistent with turbulence measurements in the atmosphere, wind tunnel and water tank experiments, and with large-eddy simulations, where similar values of the ratio are found. The RDT results are extended to show the effects of viscosity and diffusion where Re is not very large, explaining the sensitivity of the spectra and the fluxes to the value of the Prandtl number Pr. When Pr is larger than 1, the high-wavenumber components of the three-dimensional spectra induce a vertical flux of temperature (density) that is positive (negative), and therefore 'countergradient.' On the other hand, when the thermal diffusivity is stronger and Pr is less than 1, lower-wavenumber components become countergradient sooner since the high-wavenumber components are prevented from becoming countergradient. When all the wavenumber components are integrated to derive the total vertical density flux, it becomes countergradient more quickly and more strongly in high-Pr than in low-Pr turbulence. All these theoretically derived differences between high-Pr and low-Pr turbulence are consistent with the experimental measurements in water tank and wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations. It is shown that the initial kinetic and potential energy spectrum forms E(k) and S(k) near k = 0 determine the long-time limit values of the variances and the covariances, including their decay rate with time. In the special case of Pr = 1, the oscillation time period of the three-dimensional spectrum function is independent of the wavenumber and is the same as that of an inviscid fluid with the effect of viscosity/diffusion being limited to the damping of all the wavenumber components in-phase with each other. Furthermore, the non-dimensional ratios of the covariances, including the normalized vertical density flux and the anisotropy tensor, agree with the inviscid results if S(k) is proportional to E(k), or if either S(k) or E(k) is identically zero. However, even when Pr = 1, in the 'one-dimensional spectrum' in the x-direction, there is a transitory countergradient flux for high wavenumbers; only in this case is there a qualitative difference with the three-dimensioanl spectrum. This paper shows that the characteristic differences in the behaviour of stably stratified turbulence reported in previous DNS experiments at moderate Reynolds numbers can largely be explained by linear oscillations and simple molecular or eddy diffusion rather than by any new kinds of nonlinear mixing processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1120,,,,,JUL 10,1996,318,,,,,,303,337,,10.1017/S0022112096007136,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112096007136,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UZ07500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the system exhibits low to moderate (2-20 mug l(-1)) microalgal biomass with sporadic phytoplankton blooms. Both nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P) limitation of phytoplankton growth have been proposed for the estuary. However, shifts between N and P limitation of algae growth may occur due to annual fluctuations in nutrient concentrations. The primary goal of this work was to determine the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton in Galveston Bay. Nutrient addition bioassays were used to assess short-term (1-2 days) phytoplankton responses (both biomass and community composition) to potentially limiting nutrients. The experimental bioassays were conducted over an annual cycle using natural water collected from the center to lower part of the estuary. Total phytoplankton biomass increased in the nitrate (10 PM) additions in 11 of the 13 bioassays, but no significant increases were detected in the phosphate (3 muM)-only additions. Bioassay results suggest that the phytoplankton community was usually not phosphate limited. All major groups increased in biomass following nitrate additions but diatoms increased in biomass at a faster rate than other groups, shifting the community composition toward higher relative abundance of diatoms. The results of this study suggest that pulsed N input events preferentially favor increases in diatom biomass in this estuary. The broader implications of this study are that N pulsing events, primarily due to river discharge, play an important role in structuring the phytoplankton community in the Galveston Bay estuary.

Superimposed onto existing salinity variations in a semi-enclosed brackish water body such as the Baltic Sea, a decrease in salinity is predicted due to increased precipitation and freshwater inflow. Moreover, we predict that heavy precipitation events will accentuate salinity fluctuations near shore. Here, we investigated how the immune function of the broad-nosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle), an ecologically important teleost with sex-role reversal, is influenced by experimentally altered salinities (control: 18 PSU, lowered: 6 PSU, increased: 30 PSU) upon infection with bacteria of the genus Vibrio. Salinity changes resulted in increased activity and proliferation of immune cells. However, upon Vibrio infection, individuals at low salinity were unable to mount specific immune response components, both in terms of monocyte and lymphocyte cell proliferation and immune gene expression compared to pipefish kept at ambient salinities. We interpret this as resource allocation trade-off, implying that resources needed for osmoregulation under salinity stress are lacking for subsequent activation of the immune defence upon infection. Our data suggest that composition of small coastal fish communities may change due to elevated environmental stress levels and the incorporated consequences thereof. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In most islands of Okinawa, green manure (GM) application is commonly used to improve the soil organic matter content because of its cost effectiveness. In this study, we evaluated the effect of application of different GMs, i.e., Crotalaria juncea (CRO) and Sesbania cannabina (SES), on soil nutrient dynamics in relation to soil enzymes, which are a sensitive indicator of land management in a sugarcane field of Kitadaito, Okinawa. We evaluated the fluctuation of soil enzymes (dehydrogenase [DH], [beta-glucosidase [BG], and phosphomonoesterase [PHO]), soil nutrients (extractable carbon [Ext-C] and nitrogen [Ext-N], and available phosphorus [Avail-P]) with environmental conditions after GM application for seven months. We also measured the sugarcane growth parameters seven months after planting. Application of CRO and SES clearly increased the BG and PHO activities throughout the experimental period and increased the sugarcane number (ca. 11%-20%), but they did not increase the DH activity and soil nutrients (e.g., Ext-C and Avail-P). Application of CRO also increased Ext-N, but SES application had no clear effect, possibly because of the different GM quality and decomposition patterns.

Extreme weather fluctuations impose energetical constraints such as unpredictable food shortage. We tested how grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) could adjust their daily heterothermy and locomotor activity to these 'energetic accidents' with a food restriction experiment. The experimental design consisted of acute calorie restriction (2 weeks, 80% restriction) in the middle of winter, after a fattening season with low (11 weeks, 40% restriction) versus high (ad libitum) food availability. This design aimed at simulating the combined effects of the quality of the fattening season (acclimation effect) and a sudden, severe food shortage during the lean season. Hour of start and duration of torpor were the most flexible components of energy savings, increasing in response to the acute food shortage with facilitation by chronic restriction (acclimation effect). Modulations of locomotor activity did not support the hypothesis of energy savings, as total locomotor activity was not reduced. Nonetheless, acutely restricted individuals modified their temporal pattern of locomotor activity according to former food availability. We provide the first experimental evidence of different temporal levels of flexibility of energy-saving mechanisms in a heterotherm exposed to food shortage. The acclimation effect of past food scarcity suggests that heterothermic organisms are better able to respond to unpredicted food scarcity during the lean season. The flexible control of energy expenditure conferred by heterothermy may facilitate the plastic response of heterothermic species to more frequent climatic hazards.",,,,,"Canale, Cindy/I-4323-2012; Henry, Pierre-Yves/G-3139-2013","Henry, Pierre-Yves/0000-0003-2255-7347",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,FEB,2011,214,4,,,,,551,560,,10.1242/jeb.046987,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.046987,,,,,,,,21270303,,,,,WOS:000286597000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Water column samples and experimentation with N-15 labeled nutrients in the offshore waters of the Black Sea reveal strong seasonal cycles in the utilization of different forms of N, the regeneration of NH4+ and the production of NO2- in and below the surface mixed layer. There was no opportunity to sample during winter, but historical data and contemporary satellite ocean color data for the study period allow us to make extrapolations to a full annual cycle for the Black Sea N budget. The processes supplying N to, and the microbial processes within, the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL), which lies below the surface mixed layer, figure prominently in determining the sources of N available for primary production. The uptake of NO3- by phytoplankton in this system was less sensitive to NH4+ concentration than has been observed in many oceanic waters. The seasonal shift in nutrient uptake kinetics was consistent with seasonality of nutrient availability. Rates of in situ NO2- production (and inferred nitrification) for the offshore waters was 1.6 x 10(11) mol y(-1), three times the published estimates for NO3- supplied from the NW Shelf (NWS) region, which originates from riverine discharges. Measured rates of nitrification in the CIL are about 60% of phytoplankton NO3- + NO2- uptake (2.8 x 10(11) mol y(-1)). Remineralization is about 25% of the NH4+ phytoplankton utilization rate (3.8 x 10(11) mol y(-1)). Within the CIL NH4+ is utilized in NO2- production (and implied nitrification) at a rate that is similar to the rate of NH4+ remineralization from organic matter. By preserving the rates that are determined with the most confidence, and making adjustments to the rates least confidently determined, nitrification (+60%, which is within the range of published values) and ammonium remineralization (+13%), the Black Sea N budget can be brought into balance. A balanced annual budget for N cycling in the offshore waters of the Black Sea estimates a particle export rate from the oxygenated surface layer to the deep anoxic waters equivalent to 8% of the total N production. We extrapolate an annual mean f-ratio of 0.38 by the conventional formulation (NO3- uptake: total N uptake). However, the balanced N budget permits a direct comparison of allochthonous sources of N to total N production in this unusual aquatic ecosystem, resulting in an f-ratio of 0.17, which is reconciled with particulate export when the budgeted losses due to anammox and denitrification are included. The NO3- content of the CIL is sensitive to year-to-year fluctuations in the source of N from the NWS. These processes plus the intensity of winter mixing, which supplies new N for the fall-winter bloom, are influenced by climate. Oscillations in winter temperature over the past few decades allow inference as to how the Black Sea N budget may be affected by future warmer conditions for this region.

All species were cyclic in the sense that they showed fairly regular (3-4 yr) fluctuations, but amplitudes ((max)/n(min)) varied, averaging almost-equal-to 200-fold in each species. This conclusion was supported by autocorrelation and spectral analysis, and by fitting time series data to a model for phase-forgetting cycles. By contrast, data did not conform to a model for phase-remembering cycles (with fixed period and amplitude). The transition between cycles, i.e., from the low to increase phase, was characterized by a distinct shift in rate of change in numbers from low to high or markedly higher values both in summer and winter. Generally, rate of change in summer declined continuously from the increase phase through each cycle. Moreover, there was a similar decrease of rate of change in winter, although rate of change (mainly in C. rufocanus and M. agrestis) first frequently increased early in the cycle. Rate of change was delayed density dependent in all species both in summer and winter, as revealed by high negative correlations with density in previous autumn and spring for summer and winter changes, respectively. These new findings of delayed density dependence (DDD) support the suggestion that vole cycles are generated by a time-lag mechanism. Possible mechanisms of the DDD are discussed. Regression analyses of rate of change in the different voles suggest that, besides the strong dependence on previous density, rate of change in numbers was also affected by current seed supply (in C glareolus) and/or weather variables (temperature and precipitation sums) that may have affected the quantity or quality of food.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,APR,1994,75,3,,,,,791,806,,10.2307/1941735,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941735,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NE02900019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The process of harvesting merchantable material and preparing a site for planting can lead to a considerable loss of organic matter. Intensively managed stands may experience more frequent disturbance as rotations decrease in length, exposing the stands to conditions that favor decomposition. To better understand the effects of organic matter removal on forest floor CO2 efflux (S-ff), we measured S-ff quarterly in 2001 in a 10-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation in eastern North Carolina that received different harvest and site preparation treatments. The treatments examined were removal of merchantable bole (OV0) and whole-tree and forest floor removal (OM2). The organic matter removal treatments did not affect soil moisture or soil temperature, the major variables that control seasonal fluctuations in S-ff. Mean S-ff ranged from 2.23 to 6.63 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and there were no significant differences between the treatments, despite higher lateral root mass in OM0 (1552 +/- 427 g m(-2)) versus OM2 (701 +/- 86 g m(-2)). In both treatments, S-ff did not correlate to root mass directly beneath each measurement chamber. In OM0, S-ff had a negative relationship with distance from the nearest tree, while OM2 showed no effect of tree proximity. Whole-tree and forest floor removal during harvest and site preparation did not result in differences in S-ff or soil C, 10 years after establishment. Both treatments resulted in a greater quantity of soil C, indicating that the disturbance associated with harvesting enhanced soil C, at least over the short term. We attribute this increase in soil C to rapid decomposition of previous stands root system.

It is commonly assumed that DOM of terrestrial origin is resistant to microbial activity because it is composed of more complex aromatic compounds. However, the effect of DOM sources on the microbial reworking and degradation of the DOM pool remains debated. We performed laboratory incubation experiments to examine how temporal changes in DOM composition influence its microbial biodegradability in two contrasting streams (agricultural and forested) in southern Ontario, Canada. Despite a more allochthonous-like DOM signature in the forest stream and a more autochthonous-like DOM signature in the agriculture stream, we found that biodegradation and production of DOC were the same in both streams and synchronous throughout the sampling period. However, the initial DOM composition impacted how the DOM pool changed upon degradation. During the incubations, both autochthonous-like and allochthonous-like fractions of the DOM pool increased. We also found that a greater change in DOM composition during the incubations induced higher degradation of carbon. Finally, temporal variation in DOC biodegradation and production over time or across streams was not related to DOM composition, although there was a significant relationship between BDOC and nutrient concentrations in the agriculture stream.

In Hungary. all of its populations disappeared during the 1950s and 1960s and then dramatically recovered in recent years during which many populations that had disappeared recovered and new populations established. In this study, we investigated the role of environmental variables in the recovery of this species and in determining its phenology-environment dependency, as well as the role of dispersal in the establishment of new populations. Our study is the first to assess the dispersal ability of P. coloratus by means of endozoochory, evaluated by force-feeding mallards with its seeds. We found that variation in annual precipitation does not affect the presence of P. coloratus; however, the variation in the karst water level coincides with the number of populations in the region studied. This indicates that the disappearance-reappearance of P. coloratus has been driven by fluctuations in regional karst water levels, which was greatly affected by the development of socialist heavy industry and especially the operation of bauxite and coal mines. Moreover, we show that water temperature determines the phenology of this species. Importantly, we also demonstrate that a relatively high proportion of the seeds of P. coloratus force fed to mallards passed through their digestive tract and many of them contained viable embryos. Thus, birds could serve as possible dispersal vectors of P. coloratus seeds, hence they might be responsible for the establishment of new populations. Overall, P. coloratus appears to be recovering, but regular monitoring is needed to ensure its persistence.",,,,,"Vincze, Orsolya/AEQ-1159-2022; Lukács, Balázs A./N-1702-2019","Vincze, Orsolya/0000-0001-5789-2124; Lukács, Balázs A./0000-0002-3163-1281",,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-7786,,,,,,2020,92,1,,,,,73,86,,10.23855/preslia.2020.073,http://dx.doi.org/10.23855/preslia.2020.073,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000519983500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In spite of this, studies of fish school migration patterns between lagoons and the sea are lacking. In 1999, fish samplings combining fishing and acoustic sonar field data collection were performed in two shallow water channel lagoons to monitor fish school diel migration (lagoon-sea). Lagoon fish assemblages included 15 species and 10 families. The estimated abundances and the fishes' swimming characteristics permit those detected by sonar to be selected according to 3 criteria. Direct sampling by cast net confirmed that Dicentrarchus labrax schools were present during the autumn migration period. In situ horizontal sonar observation in shallow water bodies constitutes a powerful tool for the Study of fish behaviour. Fish school migration within the range of values recorded was not affected by current velocity (maximum 0.83 m/s). No relationships among school shape, surface area or migratory direction were found. The amphidromous schools were small (0.3 to 15 in 2) and observed mainly at night. Migratory behaviour appeared to be determined to some extent by fluctuations in lagoon salinity and temperature. Consistent with the 'multi-transit' hypothesis, which states that schools pass several times in front of the sonar transducer before moving toward or away from the lagoon, the net flow of fish was less than that predicted by the sonar methodology. Thus the multi-transit behaviour hypothesis should be considered when interpreting fish Population transfer data gathered with acoustic methods using a single transducer in rivers, estuaries, or channels. In addition, the exclusive use of echosounder Could generate major biomass underestimation when the fish are grouped in schools. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Surface components within and attached to the cell membrane are essential for ensuring that the overall homeostasis of the cell is maintained. However, many surface components of the bacterial cell also have an indispensable role mediating interactions of the bacteria with their immediate environment and as such are essential to the pathogenesis of infectious disease. During the course of an infection, bacterial pathogens will encounter many different ecological niches where environmental conditions such as salinity, temperature, pH, and the availability of nutrients fluctuate. It is the bacterial cell surface that is at the front-line of these host-pathogen interactions often protecting the bacterium from hostile surroundings but at the same time playing a critical role in the adherence to host tissues promoting colonization and subsequent infection. To deal effectively with the changing environments that pathogens may encounter in different ecological niches within the host many of the surface components of the bacterial cell are subject to phenotypic variation resulting in heterogeneous subpopulations of bacteria within the clonal population. This dynamic phenotypic heterogeneity ensures that at least a small fraction of the population will be adapted for a particular circumstance should it arise. Diversity within the clonal population has often been masked by studies on entire bacterial populations where it was often assumed genes were expressed in a uniform manner. This chapter, therefore, aims to highlight the non-uniformity in certain cell surface structures and will discuss the implication of this heterogeneity in bacterial-host interaction.

This study assessed upland and in-stream controls on baseflow nutrient concentrations in a low-gradient, tile-drained agroecosystem watershed. We conducted time-series analysis using Empirical mode decomposition of seven decade-long nutrient concentration time-series in the agricultural Upper Big Walnut Creek watershed (Ohio, USA). Four tributaries of varying drainage areas and three main-stem sites were monitored, and nutrient grab samples were collected weekly from 2006 to 2016 and analyzed for dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). Statistically significant seasonal fluctuations were compared with seasonality of baseflow, watershed characteristics (e.g., tile-drain density), and in-stream water quality parameters (pH, DO, temperature). Findings point to statistically significant seasonality of all parameters with peak P concentrations in summer and peak N in late winter-early spring. Results suggest that upland processes exert strong control on DRP concentrations in the winter and spring months, while coupled upland and in-stream conditions control watershed baseflow DRP concentrations during summer and early fall. Conversely, upland flow sources driving streamflow exert strong control on baseflow NO3-N, and in stream attenuation through transient and permanent pathways impacts the magnitude of removal. Regarding TN and TP, we found that TN was governed by NO3-N, while TP was governed by DRP in summer and fluvial erosion of P-rich benthic sediments during higher baseflow conditions.

We determined the biochemical profile and metabolic rate of aging planulae and examined the possible absorption of dissolved organic material (DOM) from the water by the planulae. Our study is the first to present a long-term biochemical profile of planulae. They contained an average of 2.2% ash, 51.5% lipid, 33.6% protein, and 1.3% carbohydrate. Calculation of the average energetic content of a planula revealed a value of 1.63 J planula(-1). Significant seasonal differences in planulae weight were noted between the summer and the other seasons. A significant decrease (41%) from the initial weight, 0.029 mg, took place in the planulae dry weight within 15 days. Significant decreases over time were also found in lipid (50%) and carbohydrate (83%) concentration but not in protein (20%). Metabolic rates of a planula was 0.06 mul O-2 planula(-1) hr(-1). The study shows for the first time that a soft coral planulae can take up dissolved free amino acids from seawater. Even though each of the amino acids was initially present at equimolar concentrations, there was a much faster uptake for the neutral, nonpolar amino acids, than for polar and basic ones. The potential contribution to the metabolic demand of planulae, from the uptake of amino acids, is estimated to be 11%. It is suggested that this uptake does not appear to be due to energetic considerations, but may have a more significant impact on their nitrogen budget.

Over the last six decades, an extensive area of marshland has been converted to cropland on the Sanjiang Plain in northeast China, and a significant increase in air temperature has also been observed there, while the impacts on regional CH4 budgets remain uncertain. Through model simulation, we estimated the changes in CH4 emissions associated with the conversion of marshland to cropland and climate change in this area. Model simulations indicated a significant reduction of 1.1 Tg yr(-1) (0.7-1.8 Tg yr(-1)) from the 1950s to the 2000s in regional CH4 emissions. The cumulative reduction of CH4 from 1960 to 2009 was estimated to be similar to 36 Tg (24-57 Tg) relative to the 1950s, and marshland conversion and the climate contributed 86% and 14% of this change, respectively. Interannual variation in precipitation (linear trend with P > 0.2) contributed to yearly fluctuations in CH4 emissions, but the relatively lower amount of precipitation over the period 1960-2009 (47mmyr(-1) lower on average than in the 1950s) contributed similar to 91% of the reduction in the areaweighted CH4 flux. Global warming at a rate of 0.3 degrees per decade (P < 0.001) has increased CH4 emissions significantly since the 1990s. Relative to the mean of the 1950s, the warming-induced increase in the CH4 flux has averaged 19 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) over the last two decades. In the RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 scenarios of the fifth IPCC assessment report (AR5), the CH4 fluxes are predicted to increase by 36 %, 52 %, 78% and 95 %, respectively, by the 2080s compared to 1961-1990 in response to climate warming and wetting.",,,,,"LAPC, IAP/AAI-6991-2020; Huang, Yao/GQH-3308-2022; Huang, Yao/O-6832-2014; Zhang, Wen/AAH-6060-2020; huang, yao/GWR-5388-2022","LAPC, IAP/0000-0002-0025-3484; Zhang, Wen/0000-0001-6670-3057; Li, Tingting/0000-0002-6338-2769",,,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2012,9,12,,,,,5199,5215,,10.5194/bg-9-5199-2012,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-9-5199-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000312668100020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The spermatozoa that were collected from 13 Iberian deer stags were diluted at room temperature in a Triladyl(R)-20% egg yolk medium and frozen in nitrogen vapors. In the first experimental series, sperm samples were collected from 10 mature stags. For thawing, the frozen straws were subjected to 3 different procedures: I (37degreesC for 20 seconds), II (60degreesC for 8 seconds) and III (70degreesC for 5 seconds). Sperm cryosurvival was judged in vitro by microscopic assessments of individual sperm motility (SM) and of plasma membrane and acrosome (NAR) integrities. Statistically significant variations were found (P <.05) between stags for most of the seminal parameters evaluated. The thawing procedure did not have an effect on the seminal characteristics evaluated after this process, except for SM (P <.05), with the best overall recovery rates after freezing and thawing found with the use of protocol I. Our results also show a differential resistance to return to isosmotic conditions of spermatozoa thawed using the different thawing protocols. In the second experimental series (insemination artificial trial), with spermatozoa from 3 stags, results of fertility were statistically higher (69.7% vs 42.4%, P =.014) when spermatozoa were thawed at 37degreesC for 20 seconds than were warmed at 60degreesC for 8 seconds. Therefore, thawing protocol 1, which provides slow thawing rates, was the most beneficial for epididymal spermatozoa thawing of the cervid subspecies analyzed in this study.

While tropical fluctuations in geopotential height have lower amplitude than in the extratropics, they exhibit stronger zonal coherence, or dynamical annularity. A simple index is developed to characterize zonal-mean anomalies of the tropical circulation. It reveals that anomalies in geopotential height and zonal wind migrate downward from the upper troposphere to the surface on a time scale of about 10 days. These features are distinguishable from known modes of tropical variability, the Madden-Julian Oscillation in particular.

The experimental culture was carried out in three phases designated as Phase I (Zoea VI to VIII - Z(VI - VIII)), Phase II (Zoea VIII to X - Z(VIII- X)), and Phase III (Zoea X to PL - Z(X - PL)), with densities of 30, 27.5 and 25 larvae / L, respectively. The M. carcinus larvae (Z(VI)) were reared in four culture systems, two being open (Greenwater - GW and Clearwater - CW) and two being closed (Biofloc - BFT and Bio-filter - RAS), distributed in twelve 10 L plastic containers, filled with 20 ppt brackish water, equipped with constant aeration, and water circulated by air lift and heated with thermostat (similar to 30 degrees C). The GW treatment was maintained with Chlorophyceae algae in the density of 3-5 x 10(5) cells/mL. In the CW, the water was previously filtered through a 5 mu m mesh screen, sterilized with 10 ppm active chlorine and, dechlorinated with vitamin C and subjected to aeration for 24 h. The BFT received water rich in bioflocs that was matured prior to the experiment and used molasses as a source of organic carbon. In the RAS, the culture water circulated through an external Dry-Wet biological filter. The feeding was carried out ad libitum four times daily, alternating a wet diet formula with a commercial diet, which was supplemented with newly hatched Artemia nauplii at a rate of 40-50 per larvae/day. Temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH were monitored daily and the salinity two times per week. Total ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, orthophosphate, alkalinity, total suspended solids, chlorophyll-a, COD and BOD were also analyzed.

W.; Meinelt, Thomas; Timofeyev, Maxim A.; Bittner, Michal; Menzel, Ralph",,,Humic substances,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coal, Scope and Background. Freshwater bodies which chemistry is dominated by dissolved humic substances (HS) seem to be the major type on Earth, due to huge non-calcareous geological formations in the Northern Hemisphere and in the tropics. Based on the paradigm of the inertness of being organic, direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms are mostly neglected. However, dissolved organic carbon, the majority of which being HS, are natural environmental chemicals and should therefore directly interact with organisms. Major results that widened our perspective on humic substance ecology come from experiments with the compost nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, which behaved contradictorily to textbook knowledge and provoked an in-depth re-consideration of some paradigms. Approach. To overcome old paradigms on HS and their potential interactions with organisms, we reviewed recent international literature, as well as 'grey' literature. We also include results from own ongoing studies. Results. This review focuses on direct interactions of dissolved HS with freshwater organisms and disregards indirect effects, such as under-water light quenching. Instead we show with some macrophyte and algal species that HS adversely interfere with photosynthesis and growth, whereby closely related algal species show different response patterns. In addition to this, HS suppress cyanobacteria more than eukaryotic algae. Quinones in the HS appear to be the effective structure. Furthermore, HS can modulate the offspring numbers in the nematode C. elegans and cause feminization of fish and amphibians - they possess hormone-like properties. The ecological consequences of this potential remain obscure at present. HS also have the potential to act as chemical attractants as shown with C. elegans and exert a mild chemical stress upon aquatic organisms in many ways: induction of molecular chaperons (stress proteins), induction and modulation of biotransformation and anti-oxidant enzymes. Furthermore, they produce an oxidative stress with lipidperoxidation as one clear symptom or even stress defense strategy. Stronger chemical stresses by HS may even lead to teratogenic effects as shown with fish embryos; all physiological responses to HS-mediated stress require energy, which were compensated on the expense of yolk as shown with zebra fish embryos. One Finnish field survey supports the view of a strong chemical stress, as the weight yield in fish species decreases with increasing HS content in the lakes. Discussion. HS exert a variety of stress symptoms in aquatic and compost organisms. According to current paradigms of ecotoxicology, these symptoms have to be considered adverse, because their compensation consumes energy which is deducted from the main metabolism. However, the nematode C. elegans looks actively for such stressful environments, and this behavior is only understandable in the light of new paradigms of aging mechanisms, particularly the Green Theory of Aging. In this respect, we discuss the mild HS-mediated stress to aquatic and compost organisms. New empirical findings with HS themselves and HS building blocks appear to be consistent with this emerging paradigm and show that the individual lifespan may be expanded.

O.; Stankevych, S., V",,,Influence on fertilization regime on spring barley yields in the southern steppe of Ukraine,UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Because of the high costs of fertilizers and the exacerbation of environmental problems, it is crucial not only to determine doses and timing of fertilization correctly but also to improve the absorption and assimilation of nutrients by plants. This will increase plant growth and development management efficiency and contribute to the fuller realization of the genetic potential of their performance that can be achieved only through a balanced selection of fertilizers. Simultaneously, it should be noted that for spring, barley long-acting fertilizers should be applied as essential fertilization in autumn and fast-acting ones - as supplementary foliar fertilization with soluble complexes. Combinations of these two types of fertilization ensure a highly efficient nutrition and cultivation technology in general. Our purpose was to study the complex influence of essential mineral fertilizers and foliar supplementary fertilizers (various mixtures of urea, water-soluble complex fertilizers, and humic compounds) on the grain yields and economic indicators of spring barley production in the southern steppe of Ukraine. The study was conducted in the Educational and Experimental Farm of the separate structural subdivision Novokakhovskyi Professional College of the Tavriia State Agrotechnological University named after Dmytro Motorny (the central part of the Kakhovkyi Raion, Khersonska Oblast) in 2018-2020. According to the conventional method, the two-factor experiment was performed in segregated plots arranged in two bands in four replications. We studied five variants of essential mineral fertilization and five variants for supplementary foliar fertilization. The plot area was 120 m(2); the recording area was 80 m(2). Various temperatures and significant fluctuations in the precipitation amount and its distribution during the spring-summer vegetation of spring barley greatly influenced the growth processes in plants, which significantly affected the grain yield. Simultaneously, this made it possible to more fully determine the impact of the studied nutrition variants on the grain yield of this crop. The highest gain in the spring barley grain yield was achieved due to the primary application of complex fertilizer polyphosphate at a dose of N20P60K60S22.5. However, through the lens of economic efficiency, a mixture of ammophos (N15P60) with potassium chloride (K-30) was the best basic fertilization. The difference in the spring barley grain yield between these two variants was only 0.05 t/ha, while the additional costs of applying polyphosphate at a dose of 250 kg/ha were 1820 UAH/ha higher than the costs of ammophos + potassium chloride mixture. The use of ammophos (N15P60) + potassium chloride (K-30) significantly reduces the chemical load on the soil compared to traditional fertilizer doses, as it decreases the nitrogen inflow, which, when applied in autumn, can pollute groundwater or evaporate. The number of applied potassium decreases because 30 and 60 kg/ha of potassium on the grain yields are very similar. Of the studied foliar supplementary fertilization, the most significant rise in the yield and the highest economic efficiency were recorded after a single application of urea at a dose of N-10 in a mixture with growth stimulant EFISOIL Renovation at a dose of 0.4 L/ha and concentrated fertilizer Foliq Micro at a dose of 1. 5 L/ha during microphase 31 and the second fertilization with a mixture of EFISOIL Renovation at a dose of 0.4 L/ha and highly concentrated fertilizer Foliq Micro at a dose of 3.0 L/ha during microphase 39.",,,,,"Stankevych, Serhii/U-8532-2019; Viktorivna, Gepenko Olexandra/AAC-2628-2022","Stankevych, Serhii/0000-0002-8300-2591; Viktorivna, Gepenko Olexandra/0000-0002-7821-1743; Didukh, Natasha/0000-0003-1634-0766",,,,,,,,,,,,,2520-2138,,,,,,2021,11,2,,,,,400,406,,10.15421/2021_129,http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/2021_129,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000653458100062,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is particularly important when trying to predict biological responses to rapid and extreme changes in environmental conditions. Our perception of community dynamics depends on the temporal and the spatial scales at which we make our observations and the taxonomic resolution we use. Thus, observations and empirical approaches that allow for variability in time and space of multiple, interacting drivers are essential to counteract the assumption that simple patterns of species' arrangement are driven by similarly simple processes. By altering the structure of resident communities, invasive species allow us to observe the development of new distributional equilibria and identify how variation in time and space of biotic and abiotic factors determines patterns of coexistence with native species. Here, we use the example of an invasive and an indigenous intertidal mussel to achieve this. We identify rather simple patterns of distribution of an exceptionally successful marine invasive species, the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, in its distribution along the coast of South Africa, examining relevant processes at multiple scales. In particular, we draw together research on its coexistence with an indigenous mussel, Perna perna. Over the last 40 years, Mytilus galloprovincialis has spread along thousands of kilometres of the southern African coast. Mytilus galloprovincialis has now reached at least a temporary equilibrium in its eastern limit and in its pattern of coexistence with the native mussel Perna perna. We synthesize a comprehensive body of literature on these two species that addresses processes occurring from centimetres to thousands of kilometres and from minutes to evolutionary timescales to develop a more robust understanding of the relative contributions of the deterministic and stochastic processes that structure the dynamics of coexistence. The review shows that the development and maintenance of simple distributional patterns emerge from and are maintained by variations in multiple biotic and abiotic interactions that occur at different and sometimes-nested scales. These include species-specific effects of environmental factors, such as not only high temperatures, wave action, desiccation, and sand scour or sand burial but also biological effects such as predation, parasitism, larval supply, and recruitment. Importantly, abiotic conditions can modulate species interactions, including interference and exploitation competition, so that species-specific responses to environmental conditions are important. Viewed across the environmental gradient offered by the intertidal landscape, direct interactions include examples of initial facilitation followed by later competitive exclusion. Although in a state of flux at small scales, the present patterns of distribution and coexistence have been relatively stable at larger scales for decades and reflect place-specific balances among the interacting factors, with different factors assuming prominence in different places. Detailed observation and experimentation are necessary to avoid assuming that species' arrangements emerge from a single driver or a few simple drivers, and this has clear implications for attempts to predict species distributions under conditions of climate change. In addition, the same pattern can emerge for different reasons. For example, recruitment of both mussel species is weak in the high mussel zone, but for different reasons. For Perna perna, this is because of poor survival of few settlers, while for Mytilus galloprovincialis, it reflects good survival of few settlers. With so many interacting factors achieving fluctuating local balances, the surprise is not that the pattern is so clear, but that there is any pattern at all.",,,,,"McQuaid, Christopher/AAT-3725-2020; Nicastro, Katy R/ABI-1531-2020; Nicastro, Katy/AAY-3692-2021; Porri, Francesca/M-4258-2017; Zardi, Gerardo/M-4026-2013","McQuaid, Christopher/0000-0002-3473-8308; Nicastro, Katy R/0000-0002-7071-141X; Porri, Francesca/0000-0001-8247-4506; Zardi, Gerardo/0000-0001-8798-5794",,,,,,,,,,,,,0078-3218,,978-1-4987-0545-5,,,,2015,53,,,,,,127,156,,,,10.1201/b18733,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000364174100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The measurement of routine respiration is of valuable physiological interest, as experimental results on P. annandalei identified the lower thermal limit for optimal respiration and confirmed this species as a thermal specialist given its narrow thermal window that closely overlapped the natural thermal regime in the area.

We compared reproductive performance between fleas fed on alternating (preferred and non-preferred) hosts and fleas fed solely on either a preferred or a non-preferred host to determine whether (1) host alternation incurs an immediate negative effect, and, if yes, then (2) whether this effect is greater in a host specialist (Parapulex chephrenis) than in host generalists (Xenopsylla conformis and Synosternus cleopatrae). We also compared flea performance under alternating host regimes with different host order (initial feeding on either a preferred or a non-preferred host). An immediate negative effect of alternating hosts on reproductive performance was found in P. chephrenis only. These fleas produced 443% less eggs that were 36% smaller when they fed on alternating hosts as compared with a preferred host. In contrast, X. conformis and S. cleopatrae appeared to be able to adapt their reproductive strategy to host alternation by producing higher quality offspring (on average, 31% faster development and 21% larger size) without compromising offspring number. However, the former produced eggs that were slightly, albeit significantly, smaller when it fed on alternating hosts as compared with a preferred host. Moreover, host order affected reproductive performance in host generalists (e.g. 28% larger eggs when the first feeding was performed on a non-preferred host), but not in a host specialist.

Intact paired soil cores were collected at 2-month intervals from an S x P factorial experiment at 4 field sites on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales on 11 occasions. Soil samples were collected from each core and the cores placed in the glasshouse. Sulfur was applied to one core of each pair and basal nutrients applied to all cores which were then oversewn with white clover (Trifolium repens L. cv. Haifa). The extractable S in the soil was analysed using the following techniques: 0.1 mol Ca(H2PO4)(2)/L (MCPt); 0.1 mol Ca(H2PO4)(2)/L, treated with activated charcoal (MCPi); water (H2O); 0.25 mol KCl/L, heated at 40 degrees C for 3 h (KCl-40); 0.25 mol KCl/L, heated at 100 degrees C for 4 h (KCl-100); 0.5 mol NaHCO3/L (NaHCO3); and an acid digestion of the soil (total). Dry matter yield and S content of the pasture shoots were measured for each 2-month growth period. The relationship between the various soil S extraction techniques and the response of pasture to applied S varied over time and was influenced by the level of inorganic S present in the soil and the amount of organic S extracted. When the level of MCPi-extractable S ranged between 2 and 22 mu g S/g soil due to the application of fertiliser (summer 1987-88 and autumn 1988), or after a period of high mineralisation rates (spring 1988), the MCPi, MCP,, H2O and KCl-40 techniques had the highest correlation with the increase in S content of the pasture when S was applied. The higher correlation for the MCPi, H2O and KCl-40 techniques than the MCPi technique indicates that plants obtained some S from the organic S pool. In contrast, when the levels of MCPi-extractable S ranged between 2 and 10 mu g S/g soil and the rate of mineralisation increased in response to an increase in soil temperature (June 1988 and June 1989) or moisture (September 1989) upon transfer of samples from the field to the glasshouse, the MCPi, H2O and KCl-40 techniques underestimated the available S pool and had lower r(2) values than either the KCl-100 or NaHCO3 techniques.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0816-1089,1836-5787,,,,,1998,38,6,,,,,567,574,,10.1071/EA97135,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA97135,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000077117200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model solutions indicate that the circulation at the Rio de la Plata is sensitive to bathymetry and the Earth's rotation. Even though a bimodal circulation pattern has been reported in previous papers, our simulations suggest that in the absence of winds the normal path of the estuary flow should be a buoyant plume to the north. When the mean wind blows from directions between SSE and NNW this pattern is intensified. The southward path observed seems to be the result of the wind forcing when it acts from some directions, which explains why this path has only been sporadically registered. The wind driven circulation at the estuary can be explained in terms of two modes of circulation. The first, prevailing for winds with a cross-river component, is related to an inflow-outflow of water at the exterior part of the estuary and accounts for the seasonal signal observed in the salinity field. The second mode dominates when the wind blows along the estuary axis and has a very distinctive pattern of significant sea level increase or reduction at the upper part of the estuary. This mode accounts for two extreme situations often observed with important social implications: the Sudestada, which produces disastrous flooding, and the persistent northwest wind, which on occasions results in the collapse of the drinking water supply to the city of Buenos Aires. From the numerical experiments a dynamic classification of the estuary into three different regions with regard to bathymetry, the Earth's rotation and winds is proposed. They are the upper-central estuary, the exterior estuary and Samborombon Bay. Our solutions indicate that during the summer this bay has a weak and retentive circulation pattern that favors the biota, allowing the region to become an area of spawning and nursery for several coastal species. Nevertheless, our results also indicate that the situation that favors the fisheries could change sensitively if the mean wind direction suffers even a small shift to the south as a result, for example, of climate change. Results from historical water level data analyzed by other authors suggest that such a shift could already be taking place. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Some organisms can increase their resistance to stress by a genetic reduction in metabolic rate. This relationship underlies negative associations of desiccation resistance with many life-history traits but a positive association with longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. The efficacy of stress as an environmental probe exposing such trade-offs follows from the high heritability of stress resistance in these experiments. Generalizations concerning evolutionary change come from the interaction between stress and its metabolic cost. At stressed species borders little available energy may remain beyond maintenance and survival needs so that extinctions become likely. In moderately stressed and narrowly fluctuating environments there should be sufficient genetic variability and metabolic energy to permit genetic adaptation. Phyletic gradualism is an expectation in these environments. In more stressed and widely fluctuating environments a punctuated evolutionary pattern is likely even though stasis may occur most of the time.

Similar to the open-path design, the enclosed design has good frequency response due to small flux attenuation loss in the short intake tube, does not need frequent calibration, has minimal maintenance requirements, and can be used in a very low power configuration. Another important feature of such a design is the ability to output instantaneous mixing ratio, or dry mole fraction, so that instantaneous thermal and pressure-related expansion and contraction, and water dilution of the sampled air have been accounted for. Thus, no density corrections should be required to compute fluxes during postprocessing. Calculations of CO2 and H2O fluxes via instantaneous mixing ratio from the new enclosed CO2/H2O gas analyzer were tested in nine field experiments during 20092010 in a wide range of ecosystems and setups. Fluxes computed via a mixing ratio output from the instrument without applying density corrections were compared to those computed the traditional way using density corrections. The results suggest that with proper temperature, water vapor, and pressure measurements in the cell, gas fluxes can be computed confidently from raw covariance of mixing ratio and vertical wind speed, multiplied by a frequency response correction. This has important implications for future flux measurements, because avoiding hourly density corrections could have the advantages of increasing flux measurement quality and temporal resolution, reducing the magnitude of minimum detectable flux, unifying data processing steps, and assuring better intercomparison between different sites and networks.",,,,,"Schmidt, Andres/E-6765-2019; Law, Beverly/G-3882-2010; Burba, George/G-9991-2014; Nakai, Taro/B-7417-2008","Schmidt, Andres/0000-0001-7110-6652; Law, Beverly/0000-0002-1605-1203; Burba, George/0000-0003-2095-0057; Nakai, Taro/0000-0002-6107-0614; Hanson, Chad/0000-0003-2144-6258; Scott, Russell/0000-0003-2987-5380",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JAN,2012,18,1,,,,,385,399,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02536.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02536.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000298598900032,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three microcosm treatments were set up at Cliff Head: (i) dark microcosms, in which primary production was reduced by wrapping the tubes in black plastic, (ii) faunal reduction microcosms, in which the food resources available to each animal were enhanced by removing 80% of the fauna, and (iii) control microcosms. Faunal abundances in control microcosms remained relatively constant, while the population numbers of nearly half of the common epifaunal species placed in dark microcosms declined relative to numbers in the control treatments. The abundances of almost all species in the faunal reduction microcosms rapidly increased, with proportionately more crustaceans carrying eggs in faunal reduction microcosms than in the other treatments. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that epifaunal populations are food limited. Other studies have shown that the diets of different epifaunal species are broadly overlapping, hence diffuse exploitative competition is probably a major structuring agent amongst the seagrass epifauna. The populations of almost all epifaunal species fluctuated greatly with season in the field. These annual population cycles did not, however, generally correspond closely between the Cliff Head and Seven Mile Beach sites. Therefore, no single factor, including those implicated to be important in other studies (such as temperature, photoperiod, seagrass biomass and epiphytic biomass), had a controlling influence on the population dynamics of the majority of epifaunal species. The annual population cycles of almost all species at Cliff Head nevertheless coincided with highest faunal densities occurring in late summer or early autumn, followed by a rapid decline to very low densities in winter. Animal populations inside microcosms did not change greatly at the time of rapid declines in field populations. A large-scale autumn emigration of mobile crustaceans from the Cliff Head site in response to low levels of microalgal food and/or dissolved oxygen is postulated to have occurred.",,,,,"Edgar, Graham/AAY-3797-2020; Edgar, Graham/C-8341-2013","Edgar, Graham/0000-0003-0833-9001; Edgar, Graham/0000-0003-0833-9001",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,,,,,,1990,144,2-3,,,,,205,234,,10.1016/0022-0981(90)90029-C,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(90)90029-C,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1990EP49800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

By designing a laboratory experiment simulating historical water levels of low, normal and high wetland plant submersion, this study aimed to elucidate the effects of different levels of flooding on growth and antioxidant enzyme activity for V. spiralis. The results showed that the plant crown light intensity of the treated group and control group (CG) first decreased and then increased along with the seasonal variation of the water level. The maximum and minimum values of the plant crown light intensity were observed in April and July, respectively. Similar to the CG, V. spiralis from the normal and low water level (LWL) groups was measured and had higher plant height growth in the flooding period from May to June, and the entire plant biomass also showed a steady growth trend in the same period. However, the plant growth of the high water level (LWL) group was lower during the whole simulation period, with negative growth in July. Antioxidant enzyme activities changed with the seasonal temperature, and the activity of the CC showed a rising trend. Compared with those of the CC, the antioxidant enzyme activities of the HWL group showed a 'bell shaped' trend, which was first significantly induced and then significantly inhibited. In addition, the peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities from the LWL group in April were also significantly induced. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) index showed that a comprehensive biological index could well reflect the effects of seasonal water levels in Poyang Lake on the growth of the wetland plant V. spiralis.

Previous studies showed the feasibility of cryopreservation of spermatozoa from various endangered gazelles but have also revealed difficulties with available protocols for semen freezing in Cuvier's gazelle (Gazella cuvieri). Experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of (a) 5% or 20% egg yolk or 4% or 6% glycerol, and (b) addition of sugars (glucose, fructose, lactose and raffinose) on cryopreservation using a Tes-Tris-based diluent (TEST). A diluent containing 13.5% raffinose, 5% or 20% egg yolk, and 6% glycerol (REYG) was also evaluated. Semen was obtained by electroejaculation from 22 G. cuvieri males. Diluted samples were loaded into 0.25 ml straws, cooled to 5 degrees C over 1.5 h (-0.16 degrees C/min), equilibrated at that temperature for 2h, frozen in nitrogen vapours for 10 min and plunged into liquid nitrogen. Subsamples were assessed for motility and acrosome integrity upon collection, after refrigeration-equilibration, after freezing and thawing, and 2 h after thawing. Use of TEST with 20% egg yolk or with 4% glycerol led to worse motility preservation, whereas TEST with 5% egg yolk and 6% glycerol led to better results. Addition of fructose, lactose or raffinose to TEST resulted in similar or worse preservation of motility than inclusion of glucose. On the other hand, use of a raffinose-based medium with 20% egg yolk and 6% glycerol (REYG) afforded better preservation of motility than use of TEST. With REYG, 20% egg yolk was better than 5% egg yolk for motility preservation. Differences were noted between males in their responses to cryopreservation when using different egg yolk or glycerol concentrations. Moreover, spermatozoa from most males exhibited better cryopreservation with REYG although some were better cryopreserved in TEST. The raffinose-based diluent thus represents an improvement over previous results but more work is needed to better characterize cryopreservation conditions for future routine banking of Cuvier's gazelle spermatozoa.

We have explored the mechanisms underpinning this response by following, over a period of 27 months, changes in P-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) binding characteristics, beta-adrenergically stimulated RBC Na+/H+ exchanger (betaNHE) activity, together with beta-AR and betaNHE mRNA levels and plasma steroid hormone and lactate levels. These parameters were measured at approximately monthly intervals in a single population of fish held under semi-natural conditions. Membrane-bound, high-affinity beta-ARs were present in RBCs at all sampling times, varying from 668 +/- 112 receptors cell(-1) to 2654 +/- 882 receptors cell(-1) (mean +/- S.E.M.; N=8). betaNHE activity, however, was reduced by 57% and 34% in December 1999 and February 2001, respectively, compared with an otherwise sustained influx that averaged 110.4 +/- 2.3 mmol l(-1) RBCs h(-1) (N=119). Only one reduction coincided with a spawning period but both were preceded by transient increases in circulating testosterone. betaNHE activity measured under standard conditions was not correlated with the number or affinity of beta-ARs nor with water temperature, but both beta-AR numbers and betaNHE activity were positively related to their respective mRNA levels (P=0.005 and 0.038, respectively). Pharmaceutical intervention in the transduction cascade linking the beta-AR and betaNHE failed to indicate any failure of the transduction elements in RBCs displaying low betaNHE activity. Similarly, we failed to demonstrate any link between seasonal cortisol fluctuations and seasonally reduced betaNHE activity. However, the betaNHE activity of age-separated RBC fractions showed that younger RBCs had a significantly higher betaNHE response than older RBCs, consistent with the seasonal reductions in betaNHE being linked to turnover of RBCs and erythropoiesis. Testosterone is known to induce erythropoiesis and we conclude that seasonal reductions in betaNHE are not caused by changes in beta-AR numbers but may be linked to testosterone-induced erythropoiesis.",,,,,"Pottinger, Tom G/I-6308-2012","Pottinger, Tom G/0000-0001-7661-9369; Cossins, Andrew/0000-0002-0813-5212",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JAN,2004,207,2,,,,,357,367,,10.1242/jeb.00747,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.00747,,,,,,,,14668319,,,,,WOS:000188327700021,View Full Record in Web of Science

The stocks of cod, Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758, have been declining within recent decades and the Baltic Sea is one of the most affected areas. The latter body of water with its low salinity, pollution, and vast areas of demersal hypoxia is particularly vulnerable. Areas of natural spawning are scarce and the reproductive output of cod has been irregular and more and more limited. One of the proposed solutions for this problem might be an artificial reproduction. One of such areas has been the Gdansk Deep, but the number of potential brood fish is relatively low, which makes the eggs and sperm poorly accessible. The aim of the presently reported study was to conduct spawning and egg incubation under controlled conditions to obtain viable hatchlings and to monitor the embryonic development of cod originating from the area of the Gdansk Deep. Materials and methods. The parental fish specimens were obtained during commercial trawl catches. The eggs were fertilized artificially at the field laboratory using filtered brackish sea water with salinity of 15 parts per thousand, and then were incubated at a constant temperature of 8 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Eggs and larvae development, and larvae beginning exogenous feeding were observed under a stereo microscope, and photographed regularly to determine the sizes of the eggs and larvae and to document the results of the experiment. Results. The mean percentage of fertilization of eggs was 70%. Hatching began 236 h after fertilization, and the newly hatched larvae comprised 30% of the initial stocking density. The mean length of the larvae was 3.95 mm. The cod larvae began exogenous feeding before the yolk sac was fully absorbed. Conclusion. Artificial reproduction with gametes obtained from cod spawning in the Gdansk Deep is possible, and the fertilization rates obtained were similar to those achieved with cod from the Bornholm and Gotland basins. Therefore, our results also show that cod spawning in the Gdansk Deep can be suggested as a model species for further research.",,,,,"Formicki, Krzysztof/J-4315-2016; Stepanowska, Katarzyna Ewa/AAI-4470-2021; Biernaczyk, Marcin/G-5037-2016; Wawrzyniak, Wawrzyniec/AAH-3151-2021","Formicki, Krzysztof/0000-0003-0068-4011; Stepanowska, Katarzyna Ewa/0000-0003-2359-4844; Biernaczyk, Marcin/0000-0002-7542-4233; Wawrzyniak, Wawrzyniec/0000-0002-9040-9090",,,,,,,,,,,,,0137-1592,1734-1515,,,,,2016,46,3,,,,,239,246,,10.3750/AIP2016.46.3.07,http://dx.doi.org/10.3750/AIP2016.46.3.07,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000386687000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, changes in marine productivity have been correlated with fluctuations in large-scale atmospheric conditions driven by global indices, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. During the winter of 2009/2010, the second lowest NAO index in history was recorded leading to detrimental conditions that influenced productivity levels in the northeast Atlantic. The response of the Cory's Shearwater Calonectris borealis, during the period of ameliorating climatic conditions from this drastic event, was monitored in two islands with contrasting productivity patterns: Berlenga, located on the rich upwelling area of the Portuguese shelf; and Cima Islet (Porto Santo Island), located in a poor oceanic environment in the Madeira Archipelago. We collected a multi-year GPS-tracking data set (2011-2015) from adult breeders during the chick-rearing season to examine their at-sea foraging distribution. During a year of low productivity, kernel estimations demonstrated that Cima Islet birds expanded their home ranges and core foraging areas all over the northeast Atlantic, whereas Berlenga birds maintained their distribution close to the breeding colony. Once oceanographic conditions ameliorated from 2012 to 2015, birds decreased significantly their foraging effort, and oceanic breeders concentrated their activity closer to the breeding colony. Analysis of habitat use by means of Maximum Entropy Modelling confirmed distance-to-colony as the most important predictor in the distribution of Cory's Shearwater. Environmental variables describing sea surface temperature, bathymetry, and chlorophyll a were more influential in Porto Santo, indicating higher sensitivity of the oceanic population to marine productivity proxies. Our study confirms that the Cory's Shearwater possesses enormous flexibility in its foraging tactics and that neither oceanic nor neritic populations disperse randomly from their breeding colonies to the open ocean even under conditions of environmental stochasticity. Instead, populations breeding in contrasting environments vary in their responses according to their strategies and to the changing levels of marine productivity in the surroundings of their colonies.",,,,,"Ramos, Jaime/B-6616-2018; Paiva, Vitor Hugo/GRX-9179-2022; Ceia, Filipe R./A-2196-2012; Paiva, Vitor H./J-1092-2019","Ramos, Jaime/0000-0002-9533-987X; Ceia, Filipe R./0000-0002-5470-5183; Paiva, Vitor H./0000-0001-6368-9579",,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,MAR,2017,164,3,,,,,,,48,10.1007/s00227-017-3082-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-017-3082-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000395180300011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The sea ice motion over most of the domain is driven mainly by the wind stress. Wintertime sea ice velocities are only bf the order of 1-5 (X 10(-4) m s(-1)) due to the nearly solid ice cover and the closed boundary constraint of Hudson Bay. However, the velocities rise to 0.10-0.20 m s(-1) during the melting and freezing seasons when there is partial ice cover. The simulated thickness distribution in mid-April, the time of heaviest ice cover, ranges from 1.3 m in James Bay to 1.7 m in the northern part of Hudson Bay, which compares favorably with observations. The area-averaged growth rate, computed from the model is 1.5-0.5 cm day(-1) from December to March, is negative in May (indicative of melting) and reaches its minimum value of -4.2 cm day(-1) (maximum melting rate) in July During autumn, the main freezing season, the growth rate ranges from 1 to 2 cm day(-1). In the model, sea ice remains along the south shore of Hudson Bay in summer, as observed, even though the surface air temperatures are higher there than in central and northern Hudson Bay. A sensitivity experiment shows that this is mainly due to the pileup of ice driven southward by the northwesterly winds. The simulated results for ice cover in other seasons also compare favorably with the observed climatology and with measurements from satellites.

We analysed long-term data from Finnish Lapland in order to evaluate the critical assumption of the mast depression hypothesis: that better individual performance of herbivores, followed by high annual growth rate of populations, occurs in the year following mast seeding of the host, the mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii). Since mast seeding has been suggested to occur at the expense of chemical defence against herbivores, we bioassayed the quality of birch leaves from the same trees by means of yearly growth trials with autumnal moth larvae. We also measured the size of wild adults as a determinant of potential fecundity of the species in different years. The relative growth rate of larvae was poorer in post-mast years compared to other years, rather than better as assumed by the hypothesis. Conversely, a slight indication of the increase in potential fecundity was observed due to the somewhat larger adult size in post-mast years. Population growth rate estimates, however, showed that the increase in fecundity would have to be much higher to facilitate population increase towards a cyclic peak with outbreak density. Accordingly, our two data sets do not support the assumption of a higher annual growth rate in autumnal moth populations subsequent to mast seeding of the host, thereby contradicting the predictions of the mast depression hypothesis. Temperatures, when indexed by the North Atlantic Oscillation and accumulated thermal sums, were observed to correlate with the abundance or rate of population change of the autumnal moth. The factors underlying the regular population cycles of the autumnal moth, however, remain unidentified. Overall, we suggest that the causal agents in cyclic insect population dynamics should be clarified by field experimentation, since trophic interactions are complex and are further modified by abiotic factors such as climate.",,,,,"Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014; Kaitaniemi, Pekka/A-2022-2008","Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X; Kaitaniemi, Pekka/0000-0002-5162-242X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,MAY,2003,135,3,,,,,354,361,,10.1007/s00442-003-1194-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-003-1194-7,,,,,,,,12721824,,,,,WOS:000183198000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some populations of homarid lobsters are known to inhabit coastal and estuarine areas where salinity fluctuates. Salinity tolerance varies during development, with 50% lethal salinities (LS50) ranging from approximately 15-17 parts per thousand in larvae to approximately 12 parts per thousand in postlarvae and 10 parts per thousand in adults. Larval and adult lobsters can avoid low-salinity areas using behavioural strategies. When exposed to low salinity, the capacity to osmoregulate varies with development. Embryos are osmoconformers and are osmotically protected by the egg membranes. Larvae are also osmoconformers, and the pattern of osmoregulation changes at metamorphosis to hyper-regulation, which is retained throughout the later stages up to the adult stage. Exposure to low salinity increases the activity of Na+/K+-ATPase in postlarvae and later stages. The level of osmoregulation evaluated through the osmoregulatory capacity (the difference between haemolymph and medium osmolalities) is negatively affected by low temperature (2 degreesC). The variations in haemolymph osmolality resulting from osmoconforming or partial osmoregulation are compensated by intracellular iso-osmotic regulation. Neuroendocrine control of osmoregulation appears in postlarvae and seems to involve the crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone. In adult lobsters, the gills appear to have a respiratory function only, and extracellular osmoregulation is effected by the epipodites, with the addition of the branchiostegites at low salinity. These organs are present at hatching. Transmission electron microscopy and immunolocalization of Na+/K+-ATPase reveal that the epipodites become functional in larvae and that the branchiostegites become functional in postlarvae. An integrated series of events links the appearance of osmoregulatory tissues, the increase in Na+/K+-ATPase activity, the occurrence in postlarvae of hyper-regulation at low salinity and the increase in salinity tolerance. Further ecological and physiological studies are proposed for a better understanding of the adaptive significance of the ontogeny of osmoregulation in lobsters.",,,,,"Charmantier, Guy/ABF-2425-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAR,2001,204,5,,,,,967,977,,,,,,,,,,,11171420,,,,,WOS:000167568800016,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, competition may be important in favourable climatic conditions when abiotic stress is low, whereas facilitation may be more important under stressful conditions. Seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in abiotic conditions may alter the outcome of tree-grass interactions in savanna systems and contribute to coexistence. We investigated interactions between coolibah (Eucalyptus coolabah) tree seedlings and perennial C-4 grasses in semi-arid savannas in eastern Australia in contrasting seasonal conditions. In glasshouse and field experiments, we measured survival and growth of tree seedlings with different densities of C-4 grasses across seasons. In warm glasshouse conditions, where water was not limiting, competition from grasses reduced tree seedling growth but did not affect tree survival. In the field, all tree seedlings died in hot dry summer conditions irrespective of grass or shade cover, whereas in winter, facilitation from grasses significantly increased tree seedling survival by ameliorating heat stress and protecting seedlings from herbivory. We demonstrated that interactions between tree seedlings and perennial grasses vary seasonally, and timing of tree germination may determine the importance of facilitation or competition in structuring savanna vegetation because of fluctuations in abiotic stress. Our finding that trees can grow and survive in a dense C-4 grass sward contrasts with the common perception that grass competition limits woody plant recruitment in savannas.",,,,,,"Reid, Nick/0000-0002-4377-9734; Good, Megan/0000-0002-6908-1633",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,MAY,2014,175,1,,,,,261,271,,10.1007/s00442-014-2886-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-014-2886-x,,,,,,,,24469341,,,,,WOS:000334691600024,View Full Record in Web of Science

Observations indicated that the synoptic fluctuations of the YSWC appear to be associated with low-frequency sea level variations. By analyzing direct current measurements, sea level elevations and results from a regional ocean model, this study characterizes the variation of the YSWC at synoptic time scale and examines its connection with propagation of coastal-trapped waves during winter. The model captures the observed short-term fluctuations of the YSWC at several days' periods and suggests a close relation between coastal-trapped waves and the YSWC variability. The YSWC is intensified (weakened) when the westward sea level-related barotropic pressure gradient is enhanced (diminished) due to the propagation of coastal-trapped waves. Model experiments with idealized periodic surface forcing further identify the important role of the coastal-trapped waves on adjusting the strength of the YSWC. The model results also suggest that the propagation of coastal-trapped waves contribute to the intermittent northwestward intrusion of Cheju Warm Current (CWC) in the frontal region northwest of Cheju. Generation and propagation of the coastal-trapped waves give rise to the westward barotropic pressure gradient in the YS entrance, which periodically pumps the CWC water into the YS interior west of Cheju.",,,,,"Song, Dehai/N-3011-2014","Song, Dehai/0000-0002-7519-4423",,,,,,,,,,,,,0278-4343,1873-6955,,,,SEP 1,2018,167,,,,,,14,31,,10.1016/j.csr.2018.08.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2018.08.003,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000446284700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Predicting the effects of extreme climatic events, such as heat waves, is a major challenge because they may affect both organisms and trophic interactions, leading to complex responses at the community level. In this study, we set up a simple three-level food chain composed of a sweet pepper plant, Capsicum annuum; an aphid, Myzus persicae; and a ladybeetle, Coleomegilla maculata, to explore the consequences of simulated heat waves on organism performance, trophic interactions, and population dynamics. We found that (1) heat waves do not affect plant biomass, significantly reduce the abundance and fecundity of aphids, and slightly affect ladybeetle developmental time and biomass, (2) heat waves decrease the impact of ladybeetles on aphid populations but do not modify the effect of aphids on plant biomass, and (3) food chains including predatory ladybeetles are more resistant to heat waves than a simple plantaphid association, with aphid abundance being less influenced by heat waves in the presence of C.similar to maculata. Our results suggest that more biodiverse ecosystems with predators exerting a strong biotic control are likely to be less influenced by abiotic factors and then more resistant to extreme climatic events than impoverished ecosystems lacking predators.

In surface mixed layers, phytoplankton may rapidly move between strong light and almost darkness. The nonlinear light-dependency of growth may differ between constant and fluctuating light because of the different frequency distribution of light and/or acclimation processes. The present study compares for the first time light-dependency of photosynthesis and growth of phytoplankton communities in situ under defined mixing conditions and at fixed depths. Maximum growth rates per day were not significantly different, but the growth efficiency was much higher under constant light than under fluctuating light of sub-saturating daily irradiance. Phytoplankton incubated under fluctuating light needed about three times higher mean daily irradiances to balance photosynthesis and losses than under constant light. The difference in growth efficiency was mostly caused by the different frequency distribution of underwater light, as was estimated by a photosynthesis model of sufficient temporal resolution. The present study indicates a considerable overestimation of phytoplankton growth at sub-saturating light in well-mixed water layers by the common growth measurements under constant light.

To quantify soil N availability to corn during growing seasons, a series of in situ incubation experiments using the method of polyvinyl chloride tube attached with resin bag at the bottom were conducted on two typical agricultural soils in a cool and humid region of eastern Canada. Soil filled tubes were retrieved at 10-d intervals within 2 months after planting, and at 3- to 4-week intervals thereafter until corn harvest. Ammonium and nitrate in the soil and resin part of the incubation tubes were analyzed. In general, there was minimal NH4+-N with ranges from 1.5 to 7.3 kg N ha(-1), which was declined in the first 30 d and fluctuated thereafter. Nitrate, the main form of mineral N, ranged from 20 to 157 kg N ha(-1). In the first 20-50 d, main portion of the NO3--N was in the soil and thereafter in the resin, reflecting the movement of NO3- in the soil, which was affected by rainfall events and amount. Total mineralized N was affected by soil total N and weather conditions: There was more total mineralized N in the soil with higher total N, and rainy weather stimulated N mineralization. The relationship between the accumulated mineral N and accumulated growing degree-days (GDD) fitted well into first order kinetic models. The accumulated mineralized soil N during corn growing season ranged from 96 to 120 kg N ha(-1), which accounted for 2-3% of soil total N. Corn plants took up 110-137 kg N ha(-1).

While this variation is known to be ecologically important, multiple scales of variability are rarely explicitly considered in ecological studies. Here, we combine field observations and laboratory experiments to determine the individual and population level effects of short-term (tidal) and longer-term (seasonal and interannual) salinity variation on the dogwhelk Nucella lamellosa in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada. The Fraser River heavily influences surface salinity in the Strait of Georgia, which varies with season, depth, and distance to the river mouth. At low salinity sites, N. lamellosa population size decreased following high outflow years, with fewer juveniles present, as opposed to high salinity sites, which had higher population densities in all years. Sustained salinity exposure in the laboratory caused developmental delay of encapsulated embryos and complete mortality at 9 and 12 psu. Juvenile dogwhelks (<30 mm shell length) and those from a high salinity site experienced higher mortality in low salinity conditions than larger individuals and those from a low salinity site. The inclusion of a 3 h daily exposure to 20 psu, simulating high tides in a stratified water column, enabled N. lamellosa to survive otherwise low salinity conditions for considerably longer. Overall, our results suggest that seasonal and interannual variation in salinity have a profound influence on N. lamellosa populations and that shorter-scale fluctuations can moderate these seasonal and interannual effects. It is likely that similar multi-scale environmental effects will determine survival and population dynamics in many species.",,,,,"Covernton, Garth/AAJ-8381-2020","Covernton, Garth/0000-0003-3814-4918",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,JUN 11,2020,643,,,,,,1,19,,10.3354/meps13355,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps13355,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000545931200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, vivianite equilibria and kinetics under in situ conditions are not fully understood and the occurrence of vivianite in wetland soils is rarely documented. In the present investigation we have monitored the temporal (November to June) variation in the pore water chemistry of a wet meadow soil (Sapric Medihemist) including a vivianite-containing gyttja layer. Pore water concentrations of Ca, Fe-II, HCO3, and NH4 in the gyttja layer were higher than in adjacent horizons. In contrast, dissolved Pi concentrations were the lowest observed in the profile and showed only minor fluctuations (between 0.1 and 6 mu M). Pore water composition in the gyttja layer was close to equilibrium with vivianite (saturation index, SIviv, 2.01 +/- 0.53) at constant pH (similar to 6.8). Dissolution and precipitation experiments in the laboratory with soil suspensions from the gyttja layer demonstrated that vivianite solubility equilibria were only slowly restored. Even after 120 days following perturbation the supersaturation was still high (SIviv-6). It seems that vivianite does contribute to P-i immobilization in anoxic soil horizons, but due to slow precipitation kinetics such soils cannot maintain P-i concentrations at levels below critical thresholds for eutrophication (similar to 1 mu M), except if pore water geochemistry is kept stable.

Additionally, at a more local scale the spreading of hypoxic conditions is promoted by eutrophication and warming. In the semi-enclosed brackish Baltic Sea, occasional upwelling in late summer and autumn may expose even shallow-water communities including the macroalga Fucus vesiculosus to particularly acidified, nutrient-rich and oxygen-poor water bodies. During summer 2014 (July-September) sibling groups of early life-stage F. vesiculosus were exposed to OAW in the presence and absence of enhanced nutrient levels and, subsequently to a single upwelling event in a near-natural scenario which included all environmental fluctuations in the Kiel Fjord, southwestern Baltic Sea, Germany (54 degrees 27 'N, 10 degrees 11 'W). We strove to elucidate the single and combined impacts of these potential stressors, and how stress sensitivity varies among genetically different sibling groups. Enhanced by a circumstantial natural heat wave, warming and acidification increased mortalities and reduced growth in F. vesiculosus germlings. This impact, however, was mitigated by enhanced nutrient conditions. Survival under OAW conditions strongly varied among sibling groups hinting at a substantial adaptive potential of the natural Fucus populations in the Western Baltic. A three-day experimental upwelling caused severe mortality of Fucus germlings, which was substantially more severe in those sibling groups which previously had been exposed to OAW. Our results show that global (OAW), regional (nutrient enrichment) and local pressures (upwelling), both alone and co-occurring may have synergistic and antagonistic effects on survival and/or growth of Fucus germlings.

They are mechanically very soft, enabling circulation through small capillaries. The small thermally induced displacements of the membrane provide an important tool in the investigation of the mechanics of the cell membrane. However, despite numerous studies, uncertainties in the interpretation of the data, and in the values derived for the main parameters of cell mechanics, have rendered past conclusions from the fluctuation approach somewhat controversial. Here we revisit the experimental method and theoretical analysis of fluctuations, to adapt them to the case of cell contour fluctuations, which are readily observable experimentally. This enables direct measurements of membrane tension, of bending modulus, and of the viscosity of the cell cytoplasm. Of the various factors that influence the mechanical properties of the cell, we focus here on: 1), the level of oxygenation, as monitored by Raman spectrometry; 2), cell shape; and 3), the concentration of hemoglobin. The results show that, contrary to previous reports, there is no significant difference in cell tension and bending modulus between oxygenated and deoxygenated states, in line with the softness requirement for optimal circulatory flow in both states. On the other hand, tension and bending moduli of discocyte- and spherocyte-shaped cells differ markedly, in both the oxygenated and deoxygenated states. The tension in spherocytes is much higher, consistent with recent theoretical models that describe the transitions between red blood cell shapes as a function of membrane tension. Cell cytoplasmic viscosity is strongly influenced by the hydration state.

In the first experiment animals were placed in a 3 ft diameter tank that was divided in half by plastic mesh. Spontaneously active lobsters were able to move between the two halves of the tank by passing through either of two conduits. The conduits were equipped with optical sensors to monitor the passage of animals, and a perfusion system to control the salinity of the area in, and around, the conduit. When the salinity in the vicinity of both conduits was the same (28-32 ppt), lobsters exhibited no preference for either conduit. However, when the salinity in one of the conduits was lowered, lobsters preferred to pass through the high salinity (20-25 ppt) conduit rather than the one with low salinity (10-15 ppt). In addition, females appeared to be more selective in their preference and exhibited higher overall activity than males when exposed to reduced salinity. In the second experiment, individual lobsters were placed in a shelter at one end of a long seawater table and exposed to seawater of gradually decreasing salinity. The salinity required to cause a movement out of a shelter, i.e. an avoidance response, was recorded. On average, lobsters first ventured small distances (<one body length) out of their shelter when the salinity reached a level of 18.4 ppt +/- 1.42 (SEM), and definitively moved away from their shelter (> one body length) when levels approached 12.62 ppt +/- 1.59. Although it was not statistically significant, females again seemed to be either more sensitive to salinity or found it more aversive, because they tended to initiate movements at salinities greater than those required to influence males. These behavioral data indicate that: (1) adult lobsters are capable of detecting changes in salinity which are comparable to the levels found during natural fluctuations in coastal bays and estuaries; (2) when exposed to low salinity of sufficient magnitude, they attempt to avoid it, and; (3) females appear to be more sensitive to drops in salinity and/or they find it more aversive. Previous studies have demonstrated that estuarine lobster populations are dominated by males and that there are seasonal migrations of lobsters into, and out of, estuaries. We conclude that the behavioral responses of male and female lobsters to low salinity may determine, in part, the distribution and movements of lobsters in estuarine habitats.",,,,,,"Kinnison, Michael/0000-0003-4211-2118",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,,,,,JUL 8,1994,180,1,,,,,23,37,,10.1016/0022-0981(94)90076-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(94)90076-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NY83200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We measured daily energy expenditure (DEE), using doubly labelled water in shaved and unshaved voles at the beginning of winter.

Probability of recapture over the 3 day DEE assay was strongly dependent on body mass, but did not differ between shaved and unshaved animals; however, a prevalence of larger (heavier) shaved individuals was observed.

Shaving therefore appears to be an effective method of increasing the cost of total DEE in wild endotherms in their natural environment.",,,,,"Speakman, John R./A-9494-2008; Zub, Karol/ABG-4802-2020; Konarzewski, Marek/AAR-9952-2020","Speakman, John R./0000-0002-2457-1823; Zub, Karol/0000-0001-7235-2206; Konarzewski, Marek/0000-0001-7428-6521; Ksiazek, Aneta/0000-0003-1796-9005; Szafranska, Paulina/0000-0001-7914-5664",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,NOV,2014,217,22,,,,,3964,3967,,10.1242/jeb.103754,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.103754,,,,,,,,25278468,,,,,WOS:000344867000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fruit set also varies between plants. This research aimed to improve simulation of fruit set in a process-based crop growth model by inserting a probability function for abortion. This probability is based on source and sink strength and introduces variation between plants. In a greenhouse experiment, flowering date and abortion (or harvest) of all fruits were recorded Fruit set was analysed with a Generalised Linear Model, with source and sink strength as explanatory variables. The resulting function was inserted into a crop growth model. The model quite well simulated the timing in fruit set, although the amplitude was not always accurate. Simulating fruit set stochastically looks promising. However, more experiments are needed to make the function biologically sound.",,,,,"Leo, Marcelis/ABG-8762-2021","heuvelink, e/0000-0002-8731-7195; Marcelis, Leo/0000-0002-8088-7232",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-0-7695-2851-9,,,,2007,,,,,,,40,+,,10.1109/PMA.2006.14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/PMA.2006.14,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000257236800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Euryemora affinis is a species complex inhabiting brackish to hypersaline environments but has invaded freshwater lakes and reservoirs within the past century. Reaction norm experiments were performed on a relatively euryhaline population collected from a brackish lake with fluctuating salinity. Life history traits ( hatching rate, survival, and development time) were measured for 20 full-sib clutches that were split and reared at four salinities ( fresh, 5, 10, and 27 practical salinity units [PSU]). On average, higher salinities (10 and 27 PSU) were more favorable for larval growth, yielding greater survival and faster development rate. Clutches differed significantly in their response to salinity, with a significant genotype-by-environment interaction for development time. In addition, genetic ( clutch) effects were evident in response to low salinity, given that survival in fresh (lake) water was significantly positively correlated with survival at 5 PSU for individual clutches. Clutches raised in fresh water could not survive beyond metamorphosis, suggesting that acclimation to fresh water could not occur in a single generation. Results suggest the importance of natural selection during freshwater invasion events, given the inability of plasticity to generate a freshwater phenotype, and the presence of genetic variation for plasticity upon which natural selection could act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,1537-5293,,,,JUL-AUG,2002,75,4,,,,,335,344,,10.1086/343138,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/343138,,,,,,,,12324889,,,,,WOS:000179223000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Compared with a landfill cover soil (LCS) collected from Hangzhou Tianziling landfill cell, the development of CH4 oxidation activity of waste biocover soil (WBS) was investigated using simulated landfill systems in this study. Although a fluctuation of influent CH4 flux occurred during landfill stabilization, the WBS covers showed a high CH4 removal efficiency of 94-96% during the entire experiment. In the LCS covers, the CH4 removal efficiencies varied with the fluctuation of CH4 influent flux, even negative ones occurred due to the storage of CH4 in the soil porosities after the high CH4 influent flux of 137 g m(-2) d(-1). The lower concentrations of O-2 and CH4 as well as the higher concentration of CO2 were observed in the WBS covers than those in the LCS covers. The highest CH4 oxidation rates of the two types of soil covers both occurred in the bottom layer (20-30 cm). Compared to the LCS, the WBS showed higher CH4 oxidation activity and methane monooxygenase activity over the course of the experiment. Overall, this study indicated the WBS worked well for the fluctuation of CH4 influent flux during landfill stabilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Jud, ZR; Nichols, PK; Layman, CA",,,,"Jud, Zachary R.; Nichols, Patrick K.; Layman, Craig A.",,,Broad salinity tolerance in the invasive lionfish Pterois spp. may facilitate estuarine colonization,ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,,,,,,,,,,,,"The ongoing invasion of non-native Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois spp.) represents a significant ecological threat throughout the Western Atlantic and Caribbean. As a generalist species, lionfish have been able to rapidly colonize a wide variety of ecosystems, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves, the sea floor at depths as great as 300 m, and even brackish estuaries. While lionfish have been encountered in a number of estuarine systems, the spatial distribution of lionfish in estuaries is likely limited by the species' ability to tolerate low salinities. Here, we experimentally identify minimum salinity tolerance in lionfish by measuring survival salinity minimum-the lowest salinity at which all individuals survive for 48 h. Additionally, we examine whether long-term exposure to low (but sub-lethal) salinities has negative effects on lionfish. Field observations in the Loxahatchee River estuary (Jupiter, FL) showed that lionfish can survive brief exposure to salinities as low as 1 aEuro degrees. At one estuarine location, fish survived exposure to salinity fluctuations of similar to 28 aEuro degrees every 6 h for several days. In laboratory trials, survival salinity minimum for lionfish was 5 aEuro degrees; however, some individuals survived at 4 aEuro degrees for up to 94 h before dying. Lionfish that were held at 7 aEuro degrees for 28 days showed no differences in mortality, behavior or growth, when compared to control fish held at 35 aEuro degrees (typical ocean salinity). This broad salinity tolerance may allow lionfish to colonize estuaries throughout their invaded range, and may facilitate dispersal across the Amazon-Orinoco plume. Because of the ecological and economic importance of estuaries, this facet of the lionfish invasion warrants further study.",,,,,"Nichols, Patrick/AAB-6592-2019","Nichols, Patrick/0000-0002-2772-4709",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1909,1573-5133,,,,JAN,2015,98,1,,,,,135,143,,10.1007/s10641-014-0242-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-014-0242-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000345625400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

A number of independent sources (variations in upper treeline altitude, dendrochronological data, analysis of lacustrine sediments and botanical and geographical studies linked with the dynamics of glacial-dammed lakes in the Chuya and Kurai intermountain depressions) suggest Holocene temperatures reached about 4 degrees C higher than today. Unlike the European Alps, glaciers in the continental Altai Mountains disappeared before forming again. Also, the upper altitudinal limit of mountain forests during the Holocene was greater than in the European Alps. The high variability of mountain ecosystems in southern Siberia suggests their potential instability in a currently changing climate. However, periglacial successions associated with the strong continental climate and glacier retreat represent an area of increasing biodiversity and plant cover. The historical and current sensitivity of the continental mountains to climate variations which exceeds that of the European Alps requires greater understanding, environmental protection, and increased social responsibility for the consequences of anthropogenic contributions to climate change: the isolated Altai areas contribute little to climate changes, but are greatly affected by them.",,,,,"Babenko, Andrey S./N-7704-2014; Erofeev, Alexandr A./N-8208-2014; Zemtsov, Valeriy A/D-3106-2013","Zemtsov, Valeriy A/0000-0002-9376-1073; Babenko, Andrey/0000-0003-1481-629X; Volkova, Anastasia/0000-0001-6286-0792",,,,,,,,,,,,,0044-7447,1654-7209,,,,NOV,2021,50,11,,,SI,,1991,2008,,10.1007/s13280-021-01605-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01605-y,,SEP 2021,,,,,,34519957,,,,,WOS:000695786300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The root-mean-square of the turbulence velocity fluctuations (u') ranged from 1.62 +/- 0.44 to 2.86 +/- 0.8 cm s(-1) (high turbulence), 1.36 +/- 0.2 to 1.86 +/- 0.78 cm s(-1) (medium turbulence) and 0.67 +/- 0.12 to 0.81 +/- 0.16 cm s(-1) (low turbulence). The control was subjected to gentle manual mixing once a day. Shoot elongation was significantly reduced with increasing turbulence intensity, and the endogenous indole acetic acid (IAA) concentration was significantly decreased with increasing turbulence intensity and exposure time. The plants exposed to high turbulence showed a 64.6% decrease in endogenous IAA concentration compared to the control, while it was decreased only 26.9% in plants exposed to low turbulence. IAA and cytokinin catabolism was increased, and there was an increase in the hydrogen peroxide concentration of the tissues, which triggered peroxidase activity. The total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a content decreased with the time of exposure. Although the flow turbulence negatively affected plant growth and metabolism, all of the plants survived for the experimental period. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.
