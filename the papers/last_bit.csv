One method to visualize and understand plant physiological responses is to synthesize field data sets into mechanistically-based computer simulation models. The L-PEACH model is a functional-structural interactive plant model that simulates 3D peach tree architecture and carbohydrate flow and distribution. The construction of this virtual tree is based on metamers, repetitive subunits defined as node+leaf+axillary meristem+internodal segments. The rate at which metamers are added over the course of a field season is very important for modeling shoot growth rates but not well established experimentally. Additionally, the canopy is composed of several shoot types that behave differently. In this 2010 California field study, we investigated seasonal patterns of leaf appearance rates (LAR), the time interval between successive leaves, in normal and deficit irrigated treatments on both proleptic and epicormic shoots of mature de-fruited trees. Leaf appearance and leaf growth rate measurements were recorded three times per week from the beginning of the season in April to the end of the growing season in late September. LAR fluctuated over the course of the season and generally slowed as the season progressed. Epicormic shoots added leaves at a significantly faster rate than proleptic shoots in both water deficit and normally irrigated treatments. Although there was a difference in stem water potential between irrigation treatments, there were no significant differences in the LAR between water treatments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,978-94-62610-79-8,,,,2015,1084,,,,,,313,319,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1084.44,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1084.44,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000378619300044,View Full Record in Web of Science

Near the island of Sylt (German Eight, North Sea), these extend from mid intertidal to shallow subtidal zones and are often heavily overgrown by barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides and Balanus crenatus). The effects of tidal emergence and barnacle epibionts on growth in M. edulis were investigated by field experiments and surveys. The results showed that mussel cohort lengths increased from the mid intertidal (25-35 mm shell length) over low intertidal (30-45 mm) to the subtidal zone ( 15-60 mm). In the low intertidal zone M. edulis were heavily overgrown by barnacles (2.2 +/- 0.4 g dry weight mussel(-1)). while balanid epigrowth was significantly lower subtidally (0.9 +/- 0.4 g mussel(-1)) as well as in the mid intertidal zone (0.7 +/- 0.3 g mussel(-1)). Cross-transplantation experiments of clean mussels (25-35 mm length) showed that from July to September growth was about 3 mm in the intertidal zone and significantly increased to about 10 mm subtidally. Mussel origin had no influence upon growth. Further field experiments showed significantly lower growth in mussels with barnacles than without. Living and experimentally sealed barnacles did not differ in their effect, indicating that food competition was not responsible. This investigation suggests that fluctuations in the extent of barnacle epigrowth may modify growth patterns in M. edulis which are otherwise governed by tidal exposure.

We explored how salinity requirements for successful fertilisation may govern the distribution of estuarine spawning habitat for the diadromous fish, Galaxias maculatus, which spawns in inundated vegetation on estuary banks during spring tides. Artificial fertilisation experiments confirmed that successful fertilisation only occurs at low salinities (<20). Thus, we predicted that egg distributions would depend upon the extent of low-salinity surface waters in an estuary. Using estuary geomorphology classification schemes, which classify estuaries by physical and chemical characteristics such as their salinity dynamics, we hypothesised that stratified estuaries would provide a greater extent of low salinity surface water than well-mixed estuaries. This prediction was supported by surveys of egg distributions in five estuaries in Victoria, Australia. Eggs were distributed over a greater proportion of 'stratified' v. 'mixed' estuary types. We suggest that combining knowledge of the spawning requirements of a species and physical properties of the habitat, such as those encapsulated in estuary geomorphic classification schemes, can greatly facilitate efforts to identify critical habitats and thus aid in species management and conservation.",,,,,"Swearer, Stephen/X-4882-2018; SWEARER, STEPHEN/AAC-1527-2020","Swearer, Stephen/0000-0001-6381-9943; SWEARER, STEPHEN/0000-0001-6381-9943",,,,,,,,,,,,,1323-1650,1448-6059,,,,,2010,61,11,,,,,1252,1258,,10.1071/MF10011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF10011,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000284230400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The studies were conducted during 2007-2010 with litterbag method. The observed intensity of leaves decomposition was higher compared to data obtained by other authors, despite the fact that initial material had properties, which did not favour rapid decomposition (high content of lignin, low content of nitrogen and phosphorus and large C:N ratio). Rapid decomposition is probably an effect of relatively high content of nitrogen in the soil and mitigating influence of the sea on local climate. During three years of experiment 80% loss of leaves weight was observed. The rate of decomposition was 0.54. Dynamics of concentration and stocks of elements in most cases was typical. Accumulation of nitrogen, iron and aluminium, and rapid leaching of potassium was observed in the first stage of decomposition. The observed permanent downward trend of the content and stocks of phosphorus is typical for habitats poor in the element and is an effect of its intensive uptake by plant roots and microorganisms. The loss of calcium and magnesium stocks referred to leaves weight loss, and concentration of these elements did not show large fluctuations in time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0039-7660,,,,,AUG,2014,158,8,,,,,621,629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000341552600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three experiments evaluated effects of heat and vibration on the movement of northern fowl mite, Ornithonyssus sylviarum (Canestrini & Fanzago). Individual arrested mites in an isolation chamber always initiated movement (walking) after substrate vibration (7.8-min walking duration), but only initiated movement 50% of the time (2.8-min walking duration) upon exposure to a 3degreesC beat fluctuation. Heat fluctuation in combination with vibration extended the period of activity by approximate to50% (11.6-min walking duration) compared with activity initiated by vibration alone. Mites with longer time off-host moved for shorter durations. In a choice test, individual mites consistently moved closer to a 35degreesC heat source 1 or 6 tran away, but not to a heat source 11 mm away. In a circular arena, mites were able to orient accurately to a 35degreesC heat source and reached the arena edge almost 4 times faster (11.2 s) than mites without a heat source (41.2 s). These results suggest that northern fowl mite is capable of directed thermo-orientation, as well as modulation of activity depending on the type of sensory information perceived.

Experiments were conducted to develop such techniques of three Trichogramma chilonis Ishii strains (viz. Nilgiris, Kodaikanl and lab) on stored and un-stored Corcyra cephalonica eggs. Differential response was noticed when pupal storage was attempted on un-stored host eggs at 5 and 10 degrees C. At 10 degrees C (L: D- 8:16, RH-70 +/- 10%), T. chilonis Nilgiris strain could retain its developmental arrest for the longest duration (60 days), followed by T. chilonis Kodaikanal (50 days). All the three tested strains showed a reduced storage capacity at 5 degrees C (L: D- 0:24, RH-70 +/- 10%). However, T. chilonis Nilgiris and Kodaikanal strains could be stored for upto 35 days with 60% emergence rate and lab strain for upto 30 days where emerged adults could survive for 3 days. The study revealed that when stored host eggs are used, the parasitized cards (parasitoids in their pupal stage) are amenable for further storage of minimum 30 days at both 5 and 10 degrees C. To overcome seasonal fluctuation in host availability, stored C. cephalonica eggs can be used to store pupal stages of the three different strains of T. chilonis at 5 degrees C for a total duration of 50 days (host egg storage: 20 days + pupal T. chilonis storage: 30 days).",,,,,,"Ghosh, Enakshi/0000-0003-4003-5876",,,,,,,,,,,,,0334-2123,1876-7184,,,,SEP,2019,47,4,,,,,523,529,,10.1007/s12600-019-00749-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-019-00749-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000492662100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the case of seeds with a high economic value, as is the case of nuts from the Mediterranean stone pine (Pinus pinea L), predispersal predation can also result in severe economic losses. The insect-seed relationship shows complex spatiotemporal dynamics, including patterns of dependency between fruit availability and fluctuations in insect population, occurrence of insect outbreaks, spatial contagion and masting habit. In the present study, we focus on the damage caused by a native pest, the Dioryctria mendacella Stgr. moth, to cones and seeds of P. pinea, a forest species showing a marked masting habit. We firstly identified those environmental and stand-level factors controlling the spatiotemporal pattern of damage by D. mendacella, as well as the self-regulatory effect that interannual variability in seed production could have on the population dynamics of the moth. In a second phase, we constructed a predictive phenomenological model to forecast the probability of cone damage in a given location, as well as the expected patterns of spatiotemporal spread and dispersion. Our results revealed a strong correlation between the probability of damage and crop size in a given year, pointing to a dependency between feeding resources and predator population. Additionally, the probability of damage is affected by the number of damaged cones observed in the previous year, indicating temporal contagion. Cone and seed damage is also affected by the temperature during different phases of the complex life-cycle of D. mendacella, which suggests that breakout processes are synchronized within the territory and linked to the occurrence of bumper crops and favorable climatic conditions. We detected that the level of infestation at a given location is related to site and environmental conditions, with no significant pattern of contagion/spreading from stands with high resource availability to those with low availability. Damage prediction under warmer climate scenarios reveals a counterbalance among favorable/unfavorable conditions for insect expansion and expected decline in cone production, resulting in only slight changes.

Empirical observations have indicated that stems must be in rest for sufficient time, generally 4 to 5 months, to be induced to flower in the absence of cool temperatures. Twelve trees per cultivar were tip-pruned to stimulate a synchronous flush of vegetative growth at the beginning of the experiments. The first of four sets, each consisting of three replicate trees among the 12, were sprayed with 4% potassium nitrate on a 2-week schedule beginning 2 months after the pruning date. Biweekly sprays continued in this first set until a growth response was observed, whereupon the set was retired from further observations, and the second set of three synchronized trees began receiving biweekly spray treatments until they initiated a growth flush. The schedule continued through the four successive sets of trees until the age of stems necessary to induce a flowering response was determined. Treatment applications were quantified using a one-m-square quadrate to determine the numbers of resting stems and vegetative and /or reproductive shoots contained within. KNO3 sprays applied 3 months after the pruning date stimulated initiation of vegetatively induced shoots in both 'Keitt' and 'Tommy Atkins' trees. Synchronous generative shoot initiation in 'Keitt' trees occurred in approximate to 75% and 100% of the stems after KNO3 sprays applied 5 and 6 months after the pruning date, respectively. Tommy Atkins, a cultivar that is more difficult to induce to flower than 'Keitt', had 18% of shoots flowering after the 5-month application and 100% flowering after the KNO3 application 6 months after the pruning date. None of the non-treated orchard trees flowered during this time. Stem age was the key factor correlated with flowering.

Calves are particularly susceptible to these stressors because their physiological and immune systems are still developing. There has been no formal synthesis of the scientific literature evaluating the effect of transportation on young dairy calf health and performance; the aim of this scoping review is to describe and characterize this body of work. We targeted both descriptive and analytic studies examining transport of calves, including listing how the effect of transport has been evaluated. Eight databases were searched for relevant articles with eligible studies being primary research articles investigating transportation of calves of either sex who were younger than 60 d of age or weighed less than 100 kg. Two reviewers independently screened the title and abstracts of 6,859 articles with 361 potentially relevant articles screened at full text. Of these, 46 were relevant and had data extracted. Articles reporting study location were conducted in the United States (n = 5), Australia (n = 3), Japan (n = 3), and New Zealand (n = 3). Common transport-related variables evaluated included time in transit (n = 13), distance of transportation (n = 8), vehicle-related factors (n = 8), and age at time of transportation (n = 4). Outcome measures varied greatly, including blood parameters (n = 28), health assessments (n = 20), weight (n = 17), behavioral metrics (n = 14), mortality (n = 7), feed intake following transportation (n = 4), salivary cortisol concentrations (n = 3), morbidity (n = 3), and isolation of Salmonella Dublin in fecal samples (n = 2). Outcome parameters were measured during transport or ranged from immediately after to one year following transportation. As the transport-related risk factors and outcomes measured assessed varied widely between studies, future quantitative synthesis (e.g., meta-analysis) in this area may be limited. Several knowledge gaps were identified, including methods to prepare calves for transportation, such as improving nutrition, administering medication, or transporting calves at an older age or weight. Further research could also focus on consistent and clear reporting of key items related to study conduct and analysis, as well as the development of a core outcome set for calf transport studies.",,,,,"Renaud, David/AAD-6870-2019; Costa, Joao H.

In humid tropic forest soils, fluctuations in redox state accelerate weathering of Fe-bearing mineral phases, producing a spectrum of mineral sizes and bonding environments available for C stabilization, and confounding our understanding of C stability. Characterizing these Fe-bearing phases can improve predictions of the response of redox-active soil systems to climatic changes that may alter Fe mineral crystallinity and solubility, such as precipitation intensity, storm event frequency and temperature. Leveraging inorganic selective dissolution techniques, Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy (MBS), specific surface area (SSA) analyses and X-ray diffraction (XRD), we investigated mineral speciation in surface soils of contrasting lithologies from the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO), Puerto Rico. The LCZO provides a model investigatory framework in which high C inputs to surface horizons by similar vegetation, topography and climatic forcings are intercepted by highly-weathered, volcaniclastic Oxisols or quartz diorite-derived Inceptisols, producing a gradient of Fe content and speciation. Strong correlations observed between Fe concentrations and extraction-induced changes in SSA indicated target Fe phases contribute substantially to SSA of the bulk mineral matrix. MBS analysis of untreated soils reveal both Oxisol and Inceptisol soils are largely composed of Fe-III-oxyhydroxides, accompanied by substantial Fe-II and silicate Fe-III contributions in Inceptisol soils. Fe-III-oxyhydroxides in the Oxisol soils were largely short-range-ordered (SRO), and notably, a fraction of particularly low-crystallinity Fe-III-oxyhydroxide mineral phases in these soils appear protected against harsh reductive dissolution, whereas the overall higher crystallinity Fe phases in the Inceptisol soils do not. These findings suggest that some high-SSA, SRO Fe-III phases, which likely also have high C sorption capacities, may be immobilized against reduction in these Oxisol soils. Consequently, C associated with these Fe-III phases may be preferentially stabilized in Oxisol soils, potentially driving disparate C mineralization and CO2 production rates across contrasting lithologies.

In the aphotic deep sea, organisms rely on external signals to synchronize their biological clocks. Apart from responding to cyclic hydrodynamic patterns and periodic fluctuations of variables such as temperature, salinity, phytopigments, and oxygen concentration, the arrival of migrators at depth on a 24-h basis (described as Diel Vertical Migrations; DVMs), and from well-lit surface and shallower waters, could represent a major response to a solar-based synchronization between the photic and aphotic realms. In addition to triggering the rhythmic behavioral responses of benthic species, DVMs supply food to deep seafloor communities through the active downward transport of carbon and nutrients. Bioluminescent species of the migrating deep scattering layers play a not yet quantified (but likely important) role in the benthopelagic coupling, raising the need to integrate the efficient detection and quantification of bioluminescence into large-scale monitoring programs. Here, we provide evidence in support of the benefits for quantifying and continuously monitoring bioluminescence in the deep sea. In particular, we recommend the integration of bioluminescence studies into long-term monitoring programs facilitated by deep-sea neutrino telescopes, which offer photon counting capability. Their Photo-Multiplier Tubes and other advanced optical sensors installed in neutrino telescope infrastructures can boost the study of bioluminescent DVMs in concert with acoustic backscatter and video imagery from ultra-low-light cameras. Such integration will enhance our ability to monitor proxies for the mass and energy transfer from the upper ocean into the deep-sea Benthic Boundary Layer (BBL), a key feature of the ocean biological pump and crucial for monitoring the effects of climate-change. In addition, it will allow for investigating the role of deep scattering DVMs in the behavioral responses, abundance and structure of deepsea benthic communities. The proposed approach may represent a new frontier for the study and discovery of new, taxon-specific bioluminescence capabilities. It will thus help to expand our knowledge of poorly described deep-sea biodiversity inventories and further elucidate the connectivity between pelagic and benthic compartments in the deep-sea.",,,,,"Chatzievangelou, Damianos/AAE-4039-2020; Bahamon, Nixon/K-8922-2014; Aguzzi, Jacopo/D-6574-2012","Chatzievangelou, Damianos/0000-0001-7512-5105; Bahamon, Nixon/0000-0002-5802-7367; Aguzzi, Jacopo/0000-0002-1484-8219",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,MAY 28,2021,8,,,,,,,,661809,10.3389/fmars.2021.661809,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.661809,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659177300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are geomorphological differences between the south and west coasts that result in different patterns of swell exposure influencing the processes that structure seagrass habitats. In this paper, 'sheltered', 'exposed' and 'estuarine' seagrass habitat types are defined for south-west Australia to synthesize processes influencing seagrass communities. Sheltered habitats in south-west Australia are characterized by high light, low to moderate water motion and sporadic disturbance from storms, making them ideal habitats for a diversity of seagrass assemblages. Exposed seagrass habitats are characterized by the presence of strong and consistent ocean swells (3-8 m), predominantly from the south or south-west and seagrasses exhibit a suite of adaptive traits to survive the effects of exposure to ocean swell and associated sand movement. These include morphological features such as heavy fiber reinforcement to strengthen the aboveground stems or leaves, deep vertical rhizomes and life history traits such as rapid growth and high seed set. Within estuarine habitats highly dynamic seagrass communities are the result of fluctuating annual cycles in temperature, light and salinity. Compared to global seagrass meadows, coastal south-west Australian seagrass habitats experience high light, low nutrients and high water movement. Despite these differences, similarities with other regions do exist and here we place the habitats of south-west Australia into a global context using comparative data. The wide array of morphology and life history traits displayed among seagrass species of southwest Australia are presented in a conceptual model including habitat type, physical stressors and seagrass responses. The combination of adaptations to the habitats and processes that define them make- south-west Australia a region where there is an unusually high number of co-occurring seagrass species, the highest in the world for a temperate environment (19 species), and approaching the species diversity of many tropical environments. Linking aspects of seagrass habitat, physical aspects of the environment and seagrass life history provides a context for applying knowledge gained from seagrasses in south-west Australia to other coastal ecosystems throughout the world.

Each Spring, as many as four billion moths are estimated to arrive in the Australian Alps to aestivate in cool mountain caves and in boulder fields, bringing with them a massive annual influx of energy and nutrients critical for the health of the alpine ecosystem. However, a massive decline in moths present at their aestivation sites has occurred over the past 3 years, with only a few individuals present where hundreds of thousands could earlier be found. In order to understand the possible sources of decline, we analysed historical records of Bogong moth numbers at aestivation sites in the Australian Alps, including observations on Mt. Gingera (NSW) in the early 1950s, observations from 1980 onwards in the Snowy Mountains (NSW) and an almost-unbroken series of observations each summer over the past 53 years in three caves at different elevations on Mt. Buffalo (Victoria). This analysis shows that moth numbers were probably steady from 1951 until about 1980, fluctuated and slowly fell from then until 2016 and dramatically crashed in 2017. In the Murray-Darling Basin, the main winter breeding ground of Bogong moths, changes in farming practices, such as increasing land clearing for crops (which has removed around a quarter of a billion moths annually from the mountains compared to pre-European levels), has probably driven some of the decline in Bogong moth numbers observed from 1980 to 2016. The impact of insecticide remains unclear and is in urgent need of further study. Even though we found little evidence that increasing global temperatures per se are responsible for the Bogong moth decline, the Australian climate has nonetheless become drier and warmer over past decades, possibly hampering the survival of immature stages in the breeding areas and confining adult aestivation to gradually higher elevations. The crash in moth numbers from 2017 is most likely due to the recent severe drought in the moth's breeding grounds.",,,,,,"Warrant, Eric/0000-0001-7480-7016; Green, Ken/0000-0002-7697-8377; Wallace, Jesse/0000-0002-3286-9427",,,,,,,,,,,,,2052-1758,2052-174X,,,,FEB,2021,60,1,,,,,66,81,,10.1111/aen.12517,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aen.12517,,DEC 2020,,,,,,33777401,,,,,WOS:000599578600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pieces of equipment used in this work, stainless steel made, were representative of production lines: straight pipes of different diameters, sudden or gradual contraction or expansion pipes. Local wall shear stress values, obtained by an electrochemical method, were shown to be influenced by the loop arrangement. Geometry as the gradual expansion pipe had an effect on the upstream straight pipe where the wall shear stress values were two times lower than in other configurations as with a sudden expansion. In sudden geometry, the bacterial removal during cleaning was improved by the increase of the flow rate, corresponding to the increase of the mean local wall shear stress. However, in gradual expansion or contraction pipe, cleanability was not improved by the increase of flow rate. The effect of the mean wall shear stress on the removal has been confirmed. Moreover, this work demonstrated a clear positive effect of an increase of the fluctuation rate on the spore detachment. Low mean wall shear stress zones as in sudden expansion (around 0.15 Pa) could be cleanable because of the high fluctuation rate (around 21%).

However, the effects of the gravel-sand mulch on the processes of the runoff, soil erosion, and nutrient losses are neither fully distinguished nor even known in many parts of the world. This study investigated how different gravel particle sizes in the mulch affected the runoff, erosion as well as the extent of the nutrient losses in the surface runoff. The laboratory experiments were conducted using a rainfall simulator with three gravel mulch treatments: (1) fine gravel mulch (FG); (2) medium gravel mulch (MG); (3) coarse gravel mulch (CG) and a control group, bare soil (BS). The results of these rainfall simulation experiments gave estimates on how the grain size influences the runoff and losses of the soil and its nutrients. Applying the gravel mulch significantly delayed the runoff's starting time when compared with the bare soil. Both the total runoff and soil loss increased with the grain size of the gravel mulch. Compared with the bare soil, the lowest surface runoff and soil loss was observed from the fine gravel treatment. These results clearly show that gravel mulch plays an important role in the runoff and sediment generation processes, and that it significantly reduces the surface runoff and soil loss. The losses of the total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total organic carbon (TOC) from the bare soil were much higher than those under the gravel mulching. The fluctuations in these nutrient-loss processes were the most intense in the CG treatment, while the TC content, in initial runoff, was significantly higher in the FG than the other treatments. Our findings suggest gravel mulch is a useful water and soil conservation technique in the loess area of north-western China, and these results can inform one on the theoretical principles for properly utilising gravel-mulched fields.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1801-5395,1805-9384,,,,,2021,16,1,,,,,22,28,,10.17221/141/2019-SWR,http://dx.doi.org/10.17221/141/2019-SWR,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000600770300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To understand the oyster's euryhaline adaptation, we analyzed salt stress effectors metabolism pathways under different salinities (salt 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40 for 7 days) using transcriptome data, physiology experiment and quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Transcriptome data uncovered 189, 480, 207 and 80 marker genes for monitoring physiology status of oysters and the environment conditions. Three known salt stress effectors (involving ion channels, aquaporins and free amino acids) were examined. The analysis of ion channels and aquaporins indicated that 7 days long-term salt stress inhibited voltage-gated Na+/K+ channel and aquaporin but increased calcium-activated K+ channel and Ca2+ channel. As the most important category of osmotic stress effector, we analyzed the oyster FAAs metabolism pathways (including taurine, glycine, alanine, beta-alanine, proline and arginine) and explained FAAs functional mechanism for oyster low salinity adaptation. FAAs metabolism key enzyme genes displayed expression differentiation in low salinity adapted individuals comparing with control which further indicated that FAAs played important roles for oyster salinity adaptation. A global metabolic pathway analysis (iPath) of oyster expanded genes displayed a co-expansion of FAAs metabolism in C. gigas compared with seven other species, suggesting oyster's powerful ability regarding FAAs metabolism, allowing it to adapt to fluctuating salinities, which may be one important mechanism underlying euryhaline adaption in oyster. Additionally, using transcriptome data analysis, we uncovered salt stress transduction networks in C. gigas. Conclusions: Our results represented oyster salt stress effectors functional mechanisms under salt stress conditions and explained the expansion of FAAs metabolism pathways as the most important effectors for oyster euryhaline adaptation.

While the success of applying these data to the geologic record depends on a knowledge of the distribution coefficients for these elements (D-Mg and D-Sr), there are scarcely any studies which have described how these values vary as a result of changing seawater Mg/Ca ratios. To address this, we have cultured the scleractinian coral, Pocillopora damicornis, in seawater with ranges of Mg and Ca concentrations. Here, we demonstrate that Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of coral skeletons correlate with total seawater Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca molar ratios, but that apparent D-Mg and D-Sr values do not remain constant across the range of experimental seawater treatments, with D-Mg values significantly increasing with seawater Mg/Ca ratios and D-Sr values significantly increasing with seawater Ca concentrations. These trends are not rate dependent and may be best explained by a Rayleigh distillation model, in which the calcifying space is semi-isolated from seawater during skeletogenesis (i.e. leaky). As there is a slight increase in D-Mg and decrease in D-Sr values between our Jurassic and Modern seawater treatments, the application of a constant distribution coefficient to estimate changes in ancient seawater chemistry may underestimate seawater Mg/Ca ratios and overestimate Sr/Ca throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. We suggest that interpretations of seawater chemistry from fossil corals may be improved by using the relationships derived for skeletal and seawater Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios established by our experiments, as they incorporate the effect of seawater Mg/Ca ratios on skeletal Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios.

To be specific, this paper contemplates the experimental analysis of novel plasters modified by 0.5, 1 and 1.5 wt. % of SAP to obtain input parameters for computational modeling. Based on the obtained outputs, the incorporation of SAP admixture resulted in a substantial increase in moisture transport properties including the water absorption coefficient and water vapor diffusion properties. The performed computational modeling revealed a considerable reduction of relative humidity fluctuations, thus mitigation of potential health issues associated with undesired moisture content in building interiors.

Although such networks are mechanically unstable, they can become rigid when strained. It was recently shown that the transition from floppy to rigid states as a function of simple shear strain is continuous, with hallmark signatures of criticality [Sharma et al., Nature Phys. 12, 584 (2016)]. The nonlinear mechanical response of collagen networks was shown to be quantitatively described within the framework of such mechanical critical phenomenon. Here, we provide a more quantitative characterization of critical behavior in subisostatic networks. Using finite-size scaling we demonstrate the divergence of strain fluctuations in the network at well-defined critical strain. We show that the characteristic strain corresponding to the onset of strain stiffening is distinct from but related to this critical strain in a way that depends on critical exponents. We confirm this prediction experimentally for collagen networks. Moreover, we find that the apparent critical exponents are largely independent of the spatial dimensionality.

A balance between proton pumping and dissipation of the proton gradient by ATP-synthase is critical to avoid formation of excessive reactive oxygen species due to overreduction of the electron transport chain. Here, we report a mechanism that regulates bioenergetic balance in individual mitochondria: a transient partial depolarization of the inner membrane. Single mitochondria in living Arabidopsis thaliana root cells undergo sporadic rapid cycles of partial dissipation and restoration of membrane potential, as observed by real-time monitoring of the fluorescence of the lipophilic cationic dye tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester. Pulsing is induced in tissues challenged by high temperature, H2O2, or cadmium. Pulses were coincident with a pronounced transient alkalinization of the matrix and are therefore not caused by uncoupling protein or by the opening of a nonspecific channel, which would lead to matrix acidification. Instead, a pulse is the result of Ca2+ influx, which was observed coincident with pulsing; moreover, inhibitors of calcium transport reduced pulsing.

The more widespread use of soil wetness duration as a measure of soil water status in field and pot experiments under fluctuating moisture conditions is advocated.",,,,,"Backhouse, David/A-5287-2008","Backhouse, David/0000-0003-0663-6002",,,,,,,,,,,,,0815-3191,,,,,,1999,28,1,,,,,27,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000078867400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

S.",,,The impact of temporal variability in light-climate on time-averaged primary production and a phytoplankton bloom in a well-mixed estuary,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Phytoplankton primary production (PP) in turbid estuaries is often limited by light-availability. Two important factors altering light-climate are solar irradiance at the water surface and exponential light-extinction coefficient within the water column. Additionally, the depth of the water body changes the light-climate and corresponding PP by altering the ratio of the euphotic and mixing depth in a well-mixed estuary. These three parameters are highly variable yet are often assumed to be constant by both experimental scientists and modelers because of a lack of data or to reduce complexity. Because assuming constant parameters introduces an error, we utilize an idealized model of depth-integrated primary production to analyze the (individual) impact of temporal variability in these three parameters. We only consider the main tidal and solar constituents in temporal variability of the forcings and apply a second-order moment approximation to analyze the bias introduced to time-averaged PP estimates by neglecting temporal fluctuations. We demonstrate that the sign and magnitude of this bias are system-specific and depend on two non-dimensional parameters that characterize the system. The first is equivalent to the ratio of mixing and photic depth. The second accounts for typical incident irradiance and the photosynthetic parameters of the phytoplankton population present. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we apply the model to two cases in the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) in the brackish and freshwater part. In the first application, we study the impact of fluctuations on phytoplankton in dynamic equilibrium, where biomass is assumed to be constant. We show that variability in solar irradiance has the largest impact on time-averaged PP in dynamic equilibrium, resulting in a 30 percent decrease compared to time-invariant forcing. By comparing with a numerical integrator, we show that a second-order moment approximation correctly predicts the order of magnitude of the impact of temporal variability of the individual parameters. In the second application, we study the impact of fluctuations on unbounded exponential phytoplankton growth. Also here, fluctuations in solar irradiance have the largest impact and lead to a significant decrease in exponential growth. In this case study, we show that temporal fluctuations delay the onset of the biomass by two weeks and decrease the biomass by a factor 14 after two weeks compared to time invariant forcing. Additionally, we show that the temporal fluctuations induce low-frequency variability in phytoplankton biomass with similar periodicity as the spring-neap cycle, making it difficult to observe these phenomena in real-world time series.",,,,,"Horemans, Dante M.

C, taxifolia was investigated in a small bay of the northwestern Mediterranean, where it occupies 3 distinct habitat types: (1) at the edge of Posidonia oceanica, (2) within Cymodocea nodosa beds, and (3) on sand and cobbles. To provide a basis for further experimental investigations of the factors affecting its performance, a descriptive study was carried out at this site in which both size and density of blades were measured on 20 dates in all habitats from October 1994 to September 1996. Great temporal fluctuations within the same season were evident for both variables, despite the fact that high variability was found at small spatial and temporal scales (areas within each habitat and time within each season). However, habitat effect in combination with season was evident as a major factor affecting both length and density of blades, suggesting a positive effect of seagrasses on C. taxifolia. The greatest blade length was found in individuals at the edge of P, oceanica, while within C. nodosa beds, blade length was intermediate. Reduction of blade density occurred in spring in the sand and C. nodosa habitats, but not in the P, oceanica one. Patterns were similar throughout the 2 years. Experimental evidence is needed both to highlight mechanisms regulating this kind of interaction (nurse effect vs shade-induced changes) and to investigate whether it affects patterns of invasion and replacement of existing species with C. taxifolia in these habitats. The facilitative effect of seagrasses on the alga observed in this study is also Likely to cause an indirect negative effect on sea-grasses themselves.",,,,,,"Ceccherelli, Giulia/0000-0002-9832-9677",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,1998,163,,,,,,289,294,,10.3354/meps163289,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps163289,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000073032800029,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is especially unclear how quickly communities at various stages of development respond to intermediate-scale pCO(2) change and, if high pCO(2) is relieved mid-succession, whether past acidification effects persist, are reversed by alleviation of pCO(2) stress, or are worsened by departures from prior high pCO(2) conditions to which organisms had acclimatized. Here, we used reciprocal transplant experiments along a shallow water volcanic pCO(2) gradient to assess the importance of the timing and duration of high pCO(2) exposure (i.e., discrete events at different stages of successional development vs. continuous exposure) on patterns of colonization and succession in a benthic fouling community. We show that succession at the acidified site was initially delayed (less community change by 8 weeks) but then caught up over the next 4 weeks. These changes in succession led to homogenization of communities maintained in or transplanted to acidified conditions, and altered community structure in ways that reflected both short-and longer-term acidification history. These community shifts are likely a result of interspecific variability in response to increased pCO(2) and changes in species interactions. High pCO(2) altered biofilm development, allowing serpulids to do best at the acidified site by the end of the experiment, although early (pretransplant) negative effects of pCO(2) on recruitment of these worms were still detectable. The ascidians Diplosoma sp. and Botryllus sp. settled later and were more tolerant to acidification. Overall, transient and persistent acidification-driven changes in the biofouling community, via both past and more recent exposure, could have important implications for ecosystem function and food web dynamics.",,,,,"Therriault, Thomas W./AAS-5883-2020; Milazzo, Marco/AAY-9990-2021; Harley, Christopher D.

Prior to 1850, many areas currently occupied by high-density pinyon-juniper woodlands, with their degraded soils and depauperate understories, were very likely savannas dominated by native grasses and forbs and containing sparse tree cover scattered across the landscape. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mechanical overstory reduction and three slash treatment alternatives (removal, clustering and scattering) followed by prescribed fire as techniques for restoring grassland savannas from degraded woodlands. Plant cover, diversity, biomass and nutrient status, litter cover and soil chemistry and erosion rates were measured prior to and for two years following experimental treatment in a degraded pinyon-juniper woodland in central New Mexico. Treatment resulted in a significant increase in the cover of native grasses and, to a lesser degree, forbs and shrubs. Plant species richness and diversity increased most on sites where slash was either completely removed or scattered to serve as a mulch. Although no changes in soil chemistry or plant nutrient status were observed, understory biomass increased over 200% for all harvest treatments and was significantly greater than controls. While treatment increased litter cover and decreased soil exposure, this improvement did not significantly affect soil loss rates. Even though all slash treatment alternatives increased the cover and biomass of native grasses, scattering slash across the site to serve as a mulch appears most beneficial to improving plant species diversity and conserving site resources.

We studied how sea-ice microbial communities in the central Arctic Ocean may be affected by changes in the carbonate system expected as a consequence of ocean acidification. In a series of four experiments during late summer 2018 aboard the icebreaker Oden, we addressed microbial growth, production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), photosynthetic activity, and bacterial assemblage structure as sea-ice microbial communities were exposed to elevated partial pressures of CO2 (pCO(2)). We incubated intact, bottom ice-core sections and dislodged, under-ice algal aggregates (dominated by Melosira arctica) in separate experiments under approximately 400, 650, 1000, and 2000 mu atm pCO(2) for 10 d under different nutrient regimes. The results indicate that the growth of sea-ice algae and bacteria was unaffected by these higher pCO(2) levels, and concentrations of DOC and EPS were unaffected by a shifted inorganic C/N balance, resulting from the CO2 enrichment. These central Arctic sea-ice microbial communities thus appear to be largely insensitive to short-term pCO(2) perturbations. Given the natural, seasonally driven fluctuations in the carbonate system of sea ice, its resident microorganisms may be sufficiently tolerant of large variations in pCO(2) and thus less vulnerable than pelagic communities to the impacts of ocean acidification, increasing the ecological importance of sea-ice microorganisms even as the loss of Arctic sea ice continues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,JAN,2021,66,,,1,SI,,S383,S400,,10.1002/lno.11690,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11690,,JAN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000608979000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Farm-Oriented Enhancing Aquatic System (FOEAS), which consists of underdrain and sub-irrigation systems and can keep groundwater levels stable, was developed in 2005 to solve this problem. To obtain basic information on soybean cultivation using the FOEAS in southwestern Japan, we examined the growth response to groundwater level by using two cultivars (cv. Fukuyutaka and Sachiyutaka) in 2008 and 2010. Plant growth, yield, yield components and seed components (protein and oil contents) were analyzed. We also studied the effect of sowing time (normal or late). The groundwater level was controlled at depths of 20 and 35 cm or not treated (NT) as a control. The groundwater level could be kept at the target depths (20 and 35 cm) by FOEAS throughout the experimental period, but that in the NT plot fluctuated greatly. The growth and yield of Sachiyutaka might be increased by FOEAS, especially in late sowing, but the yield of normal sown Sachiyutaka was decreased in the 20-cm plot in 2010. Yield of late-sown Fukuyutaka tended to be decreased in the 20-cm plot. These results suggest that (1) the optimum groundwater level for yield of Sachiyutaka is between 20 and 35 cm, regardless of sowing time and (2) the groundwater level should not be kept at 20 cm for late-sown Fukuyutaka. Further studies are needed to determine the optimum groundwater level for each cultivar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1343-943X,,,,,JAN,2013,16,1,,,,,84,94,,10.1626/pps.16.84,http://dx.doi.org/10.1626/pps.16.84,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000323993100012,View Full Record in Web of Science

This will provide a helping hand to developing new original and adapted wheat varieties that will be more productive in terms of the quantity and quality in the context of sustainable agriculture using less fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, and water. This would help in tackling the challenges that we have to face, especially with regard to global change. There is currently a strong societal demand for sustainability, quality, and safety in bread wheat production. To address these challenges, new and innovative knowledge, resources, tools, and methods to facilitate breeding are needed. This starts with the development of high throughput genomic tools including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, high density molecular marker maps, and full genome sequences. Such powerful tools are essential to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to implement genomic and phenomic selection, and to characterize the worldwide diversity. This is also useful to breeders to broaden the genetic basis of elite varieties through the introduction of novel sources of genetic diversity. Improvement in varieties particularly relies on the detection of genomic regions involved in agronomical traits including tolerance to biotic (diseases and pests) and abiotic (drought, nutrient deficiency, high temperature) stresses. When enough resolution is achieved, this can result in the identification of candidate genes that could further be characterized to identify relevant alleles. Breeding must also now be approached through in silico modeling to simulate plant development, investigate genotype x environment interactions, and introduce marker-trait linkage information in the models to better implement genomic selection. Breeders must be aware of new developments and the information must be made available to the world wheat community to develop new high-yielding varieties that can meet the challenge of higher wheat production in a sustainable and fluctuating agricultural context.

Phenomena such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are known to produce interannual variation in reproduction, as do severe storms such as hurricanes. Using stationary trap-based phenology data collected fortnightly from 1993 to 2014 from a hurricane-affected (1989 Hugo, 1998 Georges) subtropical wet forest in northeastern Puerto Rico, we conducted a time series analysis of flowering and seed production. We addressed (1) the degree to which interannual variation in flower and seed production was influenced by global climate drivers and time since hurricane disturbance, and (2) how long-term trends in reproduction varied with plant lifeform. The seasonally de-trended number of species in flower fluctuated over time while the number of species producing seed exhibited a declining trend, one that was particularly evident during the second half of the study period. Lagged El Nino indices and time series hurricane disturbance jointly influenced the trends in numbers of flowering and fruiting species, suggesting complex global influences on tropical forest reproduction with variable periodicities. Lag times affecting flowering tended to be longer than those affecting fruiting. Long-term patterns of reproduction in individual lifeforms paralleled the community-wide patterns, with most groups of lifeform exhibiting a long-term decline in seed but not flower production.

This virus can infect shrimps asymptomatically. However, once the clinical signs are developed, mortalities can reach 100% in 3-10 days. PCR has been extensively used to detect WSSV in a specific and sensitive manner. Nested PCR is even more sensitive than single-step PCR and had been used for the detection of WSSV in asymptomatic populations. In this work, a detailed monitoring of WSSV by nested PCR in shrimp commercial ponds in Guasave County, State of Sinaloa, Mexico, is presented. Five ponds from two different farms were monitored for growth and presence of WSSV. At the beginning of the culture, ponds from both farms showed no or very slight WSSV presence. A 3-day period of rain occurred at both farms 10 and 14 weeks of culture for farms I and 2, respectively. At this time, WSSV was widely distributed in the shrimp populations of farm I according to nested-PCR data, although no visual symptoms were observed. In ponds of farm 2, WSSV was present at low level. However, the number of PCR-positive groups was drastically increased in both farms by nested and single-step PCR. Abrupt fluctuations in temperature and salinity were documented in farm 2 after the rain, which may have contributed to the increasing of viral load in the pond's shrimp populations. Twelve days after the rain period, estimated mortalities of 80% occurred in farm 1. Nevertheless, the study ponds at farm 2 culture continued normally for three more weeks and were harvested successfully (52% and 67% of survival for ponds I and 2, respectively). The removal of 40% and 50% of shrimp population 2-4 days after the raining period may have contributed to the thriving of the cultures. Analyses of the presence of WSSV in individuals of both sexes indicated that there is no preference for this virus to infect male or female shrimp. Also, no differences in weight were found between WSSV infected and non-infected individual shrimps, as well as nested-PCR positive against single-step PCR positive organisms. Nested PCR is more useful to monitor shrimp cultures than single-step PCR since it allows knowing how widely distributed the virus is in asymptomatically populations. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The metabolism of these habitats can lead to diel fluctuation in pH with increases during the day and declines at night, suggesting no net effect on pH at time scales longer than daily. We examined the capacity of subarctic and Arctic kelps to up-regulate pH in situ and experimentally tested the role of photoperiod in determining the capacity of Arctic macrophytes to up-regulate pH. Field observations at photoperiods of 15 and 24 hours in Greenland combined with experimental manipulations of photoperiod show that photoperiods longer than 21 hours, characteristic of Arctic summers, are conducive to sustained up-regulation of pH by kelp photosynthesis. We report a gradual increase in pH of 0.15 units and a parallel decline in pCO(2) of 100 parts per million over a 10-day period in an Arctic kelp forest over midsummer, with ample scope for continued pH increase during the months of continuous daylight. Experimental increase in CO2 concentration further stimulated the capacity of macrophytes to deplete CO2 and increase pH.

Both events are supposed to be generated not locally but by a relaxation of the trade winds in the western equatorial Atlantic. Here the connection between SST variations in the two regions is investigated with observational data sets as well as ocean model simulations. They are correlated to such an extent that joint events should rather be viewed as one Atlantic Nino. An intriguing feature, counterintuitive in view of the remote forcing mechanism, is that SST anomalies off Angola precede those in the equatorial Atlantic. We show this behavior to be related to the difference in thermocline depths and a different seasonality of interannual SST variability in the two regions. While Benguela Ninos peak in austral fall due to the Angola Benguela Front being located furthest to the south and high interannual variability in coastal Kelvin wave activity, warm events at the equator are phase-locked to austral winter when the thermocline is shallow. Perturbation experiments confirm the importance of remote forcing from the equator for SST variability off Angola and demonstrate the leading role of wind stress in the generation of SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Atlantic. These wind stress variations are shown to be linked to fluctuations in the strength of the South Atlantic Anticyclone, a connection that might be important with respect to the predictability of Atlantic Ninos.",,,,,"Luebbecke, Joke/AFR-7882-2022; Lübbecke, Joke F/G-6315-2016; Boening, Claus/AAW-6387-2020; Keenlyside, Noel S/E-8303-2013; Xie, Shang-Ping/C-1254-2009; Boening, Claus W/B-1686-2012","Luebbecke, Joke/0000-0002-7839-3284; Lübbecke, Joke F/0000-0002-7839-3284; Boening, Claus/0000-0002-6251-5777; Keenlyside, Noel S/0000-0002-8708-6868; Xie, Shang-Ping/0000-0002-3676-1325; Boening, Claus W/0000-0002-6251-5777",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,SEP 16,2010,115,,,,,,,,C09015,10.1029/2009JC005964,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JC005964,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000282013800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The pressure conditions in the stratified and mixed lakes were simulated in those models, and the variations of the cell and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration were analyzed. It was observed that an increase in pressure and darkness significantly reduced the cell concentration and pigmentation in P. galeata (p < 0.01, n = 3). After 10 days, the cell concentrations of P. galeata that were grown under conditions of a water depth of 30 m were reduced by 7.0%, per day, while the cell concentration rate after 10 days in atmospheric conditions was increased by 2.53% per day. During the experiment, cells were subjected to the prolonged darkness under 0.3 MPa pressure for 10 days and then exposed to the white light under atmospheric pressure for 5 days. Even after running this cycle for 60 days, 19.5% of the initial cells could survive. This rate exceeded the cell concentration-increasing rate in the control.

The effect of harvesting on soil moisture dynamics, fluxes at the water table, and water table fluctuation were compared for different harvesting scenarios simulated under wet and dry climatic cycles. Strong interaction between shallow water tables (i.e., 2 m) and atmospheric variability is observed for all soil textures and is reduced as the vadose zone thickens, particularly after a dry cycle, as a series of positive net atmospheric fluxes are needed to reduce soil moisture storage in order for recharge to occur. Because of harvesting, the water table fluxes can increase by 50 mm month(-1), while on a yearly basis, this increase can reach 200 mm yr(-1), with rainfall events taking between 1 and 5 years to become recharge (i.e., time lag). Also, the water table is expected to rise between 1 and 3.5 m, with rainfall-water table rise time lags of 1-3 years; however, the peak manifestation of harvesting on water table elevation can take up to 7 years after harvesting. The effects of aspen harvesting are more pronounced during wet cycles, and the development of forestry activities in the Boreal Plain should consider not only preceding precipitation but also the preceding precipitation-reference evapotranspiration ratio, water table depth, and soil texture.

The objectives of this study were to determine the specific effects of leaf position and age on water status measurements of excised leaves and assess the potential relevance to sampling in a large-scale breeding program. Initial water content (IWC) (kg H2O kg-1 dry wt.) at the time of excision and rate of water loss (RWL) (g H2O kg-1 dry wt. min-1) following stomatal closure were measured on leaves of four tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) genotypes grown in two controlled-environment experiments. Genotypic differences in RWL were more pronounced at early growth stages and were more consistent between experiments than were differences in IWC. The RWL of leaves 3, 4, and 5 of 'Hercules' and ICD1385 underwent considerable fluctuations during aging; the RWL for 'Pelissier' and ICD 2627 leaves were low and much more constant during leaf maturation. The flag leaves did not display the same fluctuations in RWL as were evident in the earlier leaves. Higher specific leaf weights (SLW) of flag leaves were responsible for lower RWL values of flag leaves compared to earlier leaves. Genotypic differences and fluctuations of RWL associated with leaf aging could not be attributed to differences in SLW. Decreasing RWL associated with higher leaf insertion levels and changes in RWL associated with leaf aging may lead to misclassification of genotypes unless considerable care is exercised during sample selection. It is suggested that RWL may be influenced by reversible changes in the leaf surface associated with aging.",,,,,"Romagosa, Ignacio/A-8701-2011","Romagosa, Ignacio/0000-0001-6676-2196",,,,,,,,,,,,,0011-183X,,,,,NOV-DEC,1991,31,6,,,,,1583,1588,,10.2135/cropsci1991.0011183X003100060041x,http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1991.0011183X003100060041x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GU28200041,View Full Record in Web of Science

As many animals cannot synthesize the classes of omega 3- and omega 6-PUFAs, the dietary availability of these PUFAs can constrain the fitness of freshwater zooplankton such as Daphnia spp. In particular, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 omega 3) is considered to be a crucial determinant of the transfer of biomass at the freshwater plant-herbivore interface. In contrast to omega 3-PUFAs, the group of omega 6-PUFAs has previously been considered to be of less ecological relevance, although the potential role of the omega 6-PUFA arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4 omega 6) remains controversial. To investigate its potential role, we conducted dose-response growth experiments with two Daphnia species, D. pulex and D. magna, supplemented with EPA or ARA, which allowed us to calculate EPA and ARA saturation thresholds for growth and reproduction of both Daphnia species. Our results provide evidence that not only the availability of omega 3-PUFAs, but also the availability of a omega 6-PUFA, namely ARA, can limit both the growth and reproduction of Daphnia spp. to an equal extent. The saturation thresholds for growth and reproduction were consistently, but not significantly, higher for EPA than for ARA in both Daphnia species. As shifts in phytoplankton community composition might result in environmental fluctuations in the dietary availability of omega 3- and omega 6-PUFAs, our findings present a significant step in understanding the consequences of the ongoing global biodiversity loss for trophic transfer efficiency at the phytoplankton-zooplankton interface.",,,,,"Ilic, Maja/AAO-9143-2020; Fink, Patrick/A-5901-2009","Ilic, Maja/0000-0002-8387-9932; Fink, Patrick/0000-0002-5927-8977",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,NOV,2019,64,6,,,,,2512,2525,,10.1002/lno.11201,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11201,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000495506200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we analyze and review three important aspects of such experiments. First, we consider the effects of instrumental measurement errors and random fluctuations of body mass on the total phenotypic variation. We illustrate this with the analysis of measurements of oxygen consumption in an open-flow respirometry set-ups. We conclude that measurement errors and fluctuations of body mass are likely to reduce the repeatability of oxygen consumption by about one third. Using published estimates of repeatability of metabolic rates we also showed that it does not tend to decline with increasing time between measurements. Second, we review data on narrow sense heritability (h(2)) of metabolic rates in mammals. The results are equivocal: many studies report very low (similar to 0.1) h(2), whereas some recent studies (including our own estimates of h 2 in laboratory mice, obtained by means of parent-offspring regression) report significant h(2) >= 0.4. Finally, we discuss consequences of the lack of replicated lines in artificial selection experiments. We focus on the confounding effect of genetic drift on statistical inferences related to primary (selected) and secondary (correlated) traits, in the absence of replications. We review literature data and analyze them following the guidelines formulated by Henderson (1989, 1997). We conclude that most results obtained in unreplicated experiments are probably robust enough to ascribe them to the effect of selection, rather than genetic drift. However, Henderson's guidelines by no means should be treated as a legitimate substitute of the analysis of variance, based on replicated lines.",,,,,"Konarzewski, Marek/AAR-9952-2020","Konarzewski, Marek/0000-0001-7428-6521; Ksiazek, Aneta/0000-0003-1796-9005",,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,JUN,2005,45,3,,,,,416,425,,10.1093/icb/45.3.416,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/45.3.416,,,,,,,,21676787,,,,,WOS:000230434400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to establish their euryhalinity range and to fully understand the ontogenetic changes in L. vannamei osmoregulatory pattern, we evaluated the effect of six salinities (5, 10, 20, 32, 45 and 60 psu) on 17 developmental stages by directly exposing them to experimental salinities and conducting observations during the next 48 h.

The hyper-hypo osmoregulatory pattern exhibited by juvenile and adult appears to be established early in the first post-larval stage PL1 (ontogenetic osmoregulation pattern type 3), with higher tolerance to salinity variations observed in PL2, PL4 and PL22 suggesting that L. vannamei shows a progressive increase in the efficiency of osmoregulatory mechanism following last metamorphosis.

We sampled 579 trees representing five upper montane mixed-conifer species at the Teakettle Experimental Forest in California's southern Sierra Nevada to determine species-specific responses to annual climatic fluctuations. Using the Kalman filter, we examined the affect of local stand density on growth response and whether the growth-climate relationship improved with a time lag.

Specific features of CO2 emission from soil as a result of short-term summer green manuring of fallow fields (during 35-40 days from sowing to plowing into the soil of Raphanus sativus var. oleifera Metzg) have been studied. This is a non-standard farming practice used in the forest-steppe zone of the Cis-Baikal Region. Changes in the seasonal dynamics of the CO2 emission relative to the traditional black fallow were studied in three-year (2015-2017) field experiments on gray forest silt loamy soil. An increase in the intensity of CO2 emission from the soil surface after the green mass is plowed into the soil was shown for two crop rotations. The total (May-September) CO2 efflux from the soil in the variant with green manure was 1.3-1.6 times higher than that from the traditionally cultivated soil in all years of the experiment. The intensity of mineralization processes on the plots with green manure enhanced by 38-131% in comparison with that in the black fallow. The loss of carbon reached 19-79% of the amount accumulated in the net primary production. The range of fluctuations in the total CO2 efflux from the soil depended on a combination of factors: hydrothermic conditions, the C-org and N-tot content in soil; the C-to-N ratio, the N and water contents in tissues of green manure, and the carbon stock in root and aboveground residues of the precursor. The correlation between the CO2 efflux and the studied factors weakened in the following sequence: qualitative characteristics of the green mass of oil radish > initial soil fertility > carbon pool in residues of the precursor. The results obtained indicate that the application of green manure to the fallow field increases the CO2 emission from gray forest soil during the warm season.",,,,,,"Sokolova, Lada/0000-0002-5178-1404; Zorina, Svetlana/0000-0002-7587-981X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1064-2293,1556-195X,,,,OCT,2021,54,10,,,,,1564,1574,,10.1134/S1064229321100112,http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1064229321100112,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000722868400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The month numerical simulation revealed the wind-induced currents of the lake, two gyres in the mid-layer, and depth-averaged monthly mean currents. Further numerical experiments studying the mechanism of the two gyres in the lake showed the important role of topography in gyre formation. The thermal structure of the lake and its evolution both in space and in time as predicted by the model showed very good agreement with the observed values and characteristics of Yachiyo Lake. The internal gravity waves, which are crucial for mixing in the stratified lake, are depicted by the vertical fluctuation of isotherms.

Glucose plus nitrate addition gave the highest RQ value in the agricultural soil whereas addition of glucose alone gave the highest RQ value in the forest soil. Generally, glucose plus ammonium addition resulted in lower RQ values than glucose addition alone. When glucose was added to soil at field rates of C input, the RQ value showed fluctuations between 0.44 and 1.35. Low C supply caused rapid return of the initially enhanced RQ value towards those of basal respiration, that was typically < 1. The experiment showed that both respiratory activity and respiratory quotient increased with increasing amount of available C.

This study evaluated the effects of seasonality on abundance, richness, diversity and composition of an insect group, drosophilids, including species native to the Neotropical region and exotic ones. Three preserved fragments of the northern Atlantic Forest were surveyed, where temperatures are above 20 degrees C throughout the year and rainfall regimes define two seasons (dry and rainy). As opposed to other studies about arthropods in tropical regions, we observed that abundance of drosophilids was significantly higher in the dry season, possibly due to biological aspects and the colonization strategy adopted by the exotic species in these environments. Contrarily to abundance, we did not observe a seasonal pattern for richness. As for other parts of the Atlantic Forest, the most representative Neotropical species (Drosophila willistoni, D. sturtevanti, D. paulistorum and D. prosaltans) were significantly more abundant in the rainy season. Among the most abundant exotic species, D. malerkotliana, Zaprionus indianus and Scaptodrosophila latifasciaeformis were more importantly represented the dry season, while D. simulans was more abundant in the rainy period.

In a pot experiment, plants were subjected to two treatments: shading during stem elongation, reducing growth; and climatic stress (low radiation and chilling) at meiosis, inducing pollen sterility. The percentage of grain setting among the two oldest florets within each spikelet (LF) and the ratios of grain number to (i) biomass of the chaff and (ii) biomass of the straw plus chaff were markedly reduced by the stress at meiosis and either little or not affected by shading during stem elongation. Two indices were tested in the field: LF and the ratio, RK, of the grain number per ear to an estimate, based on chaff biomass, of the potential number in the absence of sterility. These indices were measured in a network of five field experiments with six cultivars. The fluctuations in the indices were compared to those of a reference criterion that identified sterility: the rate of grain setting among the two oldest florets of each spikelet, measured in bagged ears to prevent cross-pollination. Both indices were reduced when the reference criterion diagnosed a major sterility but they did not always decrease in case of minor sterility. Classification of the cultivars based on the reference criterion was similar to that based on LF, but not on RK.

FDC values in the pebble biofilms increased with fluctuations during the study period, ranging from 3.6% to 9.2%.

Percentages of bacterial production to net primary production ranged between 21% and 120%.

An experiment was conducted in a weighing lysimeter to characterize the diurnal dynamics of evaporation under natural conditions. Sampling revealed a completely dry surface sand layer after 5 days of evaporation. Its thickness was <1 cm early in the morning, increasing to reach 4-5 cm in the evening. This evidence points out fundamental limitations of the approaches that assume hydraulic connectivity from the water table up to the surface, as well as those that suppose monotonic drying when unsteady conditions prevail. The computed vapor phase diffusion rates from the apparent drying front based on Fick's law failed to reproduce the measured cumulative evaporation during the sampling day. We propose that two processes rule natural evaporation resulting from daily fluctuations of climatic variables: (i) evaporation of water, stored during nighttime due to redistribution and vapor condensation, directly into the atmosphere from the soil surface during the early morning hours, that could be simulated using a mass transfer approach and (ii) subsurface evaporation limited by Fickian diffusion, afterward. For the conditions prevailing during the sampling day, the amount of water stored at the vicinity of the soil surface was 0.3 mm and was depleted before 11:00. Combining evaporation from the surface before 11:00 and subsurface evaporation limited by Fickian diffusion after that time, the agreement between the estimated and measured cumulative evaporation was significantly improved.",,,,,"Lunati, Ivan/GXH-4749-2022; Parlange, Marc/A-3403-2015","Lunati, Ivan/0000-0002-3205-7429; Selker, John/0000-0001-9751-6094; Parlange, Marc/0000-0001-6972-4371",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,JUL,2013,49,7,,,,,4022,4034,,10.1002/wrcr.20293,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wrcr.20293,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000323419100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The outcome of such hormonal fluctuations can affect the organism's physiology and behavior; however, relatively few studies in reptiles have progressed past the effects of stress on the plasma levels of CORT. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of CORT on lizard behavior. We focused on activity and thermoregulation of juveniles of the wall lizard, Podarcis muralis. Juveniles with experimentally elevated plasma CORT concentrations showed a higher moving rate and spent a greater amount of time moving. They also spent more time being involved in attempts to escape from a terrarium. This enhanced locomotor activity was associated with significant changes in thermoregulatory behavior, as CORT-increased individuals had reduced thermoregulatory activity than the controls. The same pattern of results was obtained in nature and under laboratory conditions. Thus, CORT levels appear to mediate an important trade-off between locomotor activity and thermoregulation. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the effect of CORT on lizard thermoregulation has been examined. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Keith",,,Climate has a larger effect than stand basal area on wood density in Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum in the southwestern USA,ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Key message Stand basal area of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosavar.scopulorumEngelm.) in the US Southwest has little effect on the density of the wood produced, but climatic fluctuations have a strong effect. Wood density increases during drought, particularly if the drought occurs in late winter/early spring. Future droughts, as are predicted to increase in the US Southwest, may lead to production of smaller radial increments of higher density wood in ponderosa pine. Context Forest restoration treatments in the US Southwest are generating large quantities of small-diameter logs. Due to negative perceptions about ponderosa pine wood quality, this material is often seen as a waste disposal problem rather than a high-value resource. Aims Our objective was to understand more about variation in southwestern US ponderosa pine wood density, an important indicator of wood quality. Specifically, we investigated the effect of stand basal area on wood density, and the effect of annual and quarterly climatic variation on wood density. Methods We collected samples from 54 trees grown at six different basal area levels from a replicated stand density experiment. Pith-to-bark strips were used in an X-ray densitometer to obtain annual density and growth measurements from 1919 to the present. Results Stand density had a strong effect on growth rate, but little effect on wood density. However, climatic variation did influence wood density, which increased in drought years before quickly returning to pre-drought levels. Conclusion Stand basal area is not a good indicator of wood density for foresters planning to utilize material from timber harvests in the southwestern USA. Future droughts, as are predicted to increase in the region, will likely reduce wood volume production but may increase wood density in ponderosa pine.",,,,,"Meador, Andrew Sanchez/AAD-8223-2019","Meador, Andrew Sanchez/0000-0003-4238-8587; Vaughan, Damon/0000-0003-4976-6501",,,,,,,,,,,,,1286-4560,1297-966X,,,,AUG 8,2019,76,3,,,,,,,85,10.1007/s13595-019-0869-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-019-0869-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000480481500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Microorganisms generally protect against fluctuating salinities through the uptake, production, and release of compatible solutes. Little is known, however, about the use or fate of glycine betaine (GBT hereafter), one of the most common compatible solutes, in sea-ice diatoms confronted with shifts in salinity. We quantified intracellular concentrations and used [C-14]-labeled compounds to track the uptake and fate of the nitrogen-containing osmolyte GBT and its precursor choline in three Antarctic sea-ice diatoms Nitzschia lecointei, Navicula cf. perminuta, and Fragilariopsis cylindrus at -1 degrees C. Experiments show that these diatoms have effective transporters for GBT, but take up lesser amounts of choline. Neither compound was respired. Uptake of GBT protected cells against hyperosmotic shock and corresponded with reduced production of extracellular polysaccharides in N. lecointei cells, which released 85% of the retained GBT following hypoosmotic shock. The ability of sea-ice diatoms to rapidly scavenge and release compatible solutes is likely an important strategy for survival during steep fluctuations in salinity.

As a general rule, the spectra from the top layers of the shallow (1, 2 and 3) and the deep (4, 5 and 6) moorings have a distinct peak in the temporal mesoscale band (periods between 70 and 170 days), with a general redistribution of energy towards the higher-frequencies near the ocean floor.

During 2-4 mo of each season, physiological indicators were monitored, including photosynthesis, glutamine synthetase activity, and protein content in shoots, and carbohydrates and total nitrogen and carbon in shoot and subterranean tissues. Where the physical environment (light or salinity) was suboptimal, all physiological indices, except photosynthetic rate, showed similar stress responses, which ranged from a slow decline to a rapid drop in physiological function. Levels of soluble carbohydrates decreased in response to unfavorable conditions more rapidly than did insoluble carbohydrates. Shoot protein of V. americana declined prior to transplant death, suggesting that measuring protein content may provide a rapid assessment of physiological health. V. americana transplants at the low-salinity upstream site died during both wet and dry season experiments, likely in response to light limitation and/or partial burial by sediments. At the far downstream site, death occurred within 2-4 wk, and was attributable to elevated salinities (> ca. 15 parts per thousand).

More than 75% of January-collected beetles survived at -5 degrees C for 30 days, at -15 degrees C for 60 days and more than 40% of them survived at -26 degrees C for 12 h. High resistance against inoculation of body fluids with external ice crystals, and low mortality, was observed when January-collected beetles were encased in an ice block for 14 days. Thus, the physiological limits of cold tolerance measured at individual level in laboratory were safely sufficient for survival of P. chalcographus at any conceivable cold spell that may occur in Central Europe. In contrast, the field experiment showed that winter survival fluctuated between 23.8% and 69.2% at a population level depending on microclimatic conditions in different altitudes and overwintering locations (standing tree trunk or ground level). The meaning of laboratory-assessed physiological limits of cold tolerance for predictions of population winter survival in the field is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the projected increase in the fluctuation of water supply from precipitation during the growing season in this area in the future, it is important to investigate the responses of the species that make up this new community to soil water availability. Using a transplant experimental design, we compared the response of leaf traits and growth to different water conditions for species grouped according to their original habitat of wetland or meadow. Twelve perennial herbaceous species, which form an alpine swamp meadow community in Maqu County in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, were used in this study and subjected to two water treatments, namely waterlogged and dry-down. Overall, significant differences in leaf production in response to soil water availability were found for these two groups, indicating strongly different effects of water availability on their growth. Furthermore, the meadow group had lower specific leaf area, leaf area and relative leaf water content, but thicker leaves than those of the wetland group, indicating significant habitat-specific differences in leaf morphology. Regarding physiological traits, the wetland group had significantly higher photosynthetic rates in inundated conditions, whereas for the meadow group the photosynthetic rate was greatest in cyclically dry conditions. Likewise, a similar pattern was observed for stomatal conductance; however, both groups achieved higher instantaneous water use efficiency during the dry-down treatment. The results of this study indicate that the composition of the alpine swamp meadow could be sensitive to changes in precipitation and might be changed substantially by future declines in water supply, as predicted by global climate change models for this region. This potential for compositional change of the community should be considered when management and conservation decisions are made.",,,,,"Nicotra, Adrienne B/C-1361-2009","Nicotra, Adrienne B/0000-0001-6578-369X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2051-1434,,,,,NOV 11,2015,3,,,,,,,,cov046,10.1093/conphys/cov046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/conphys/cov046,,,,,,,,27293730,,,,,WOS:000375201400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Phyllosoma larvae were stocked at two densities (2 or 4 phyllosoma container(-1); 2P or 4P) and fed juvenile Artemia (1.6 mm total length) at two feed rates (1.5 or 0.75 Artemia ml(-1); 1.5A or 0.75A) in 50 ml of seawater. This provided a combination of 4 treatments (2P/1.5A, 2P/0.75A, 4P/1.5A, 4P/0.75A). Daily intake of Artemia by phyllosoma was monitored and assessed relative to moult size and intermoult duration at differing predator-prey densities. Phyllosoma numbers were held constant; in the event of mortality, animals were replaced with others from the same cohort cultured under similar conditions. Phyllosoma endogenous reserves at hatch combined with the lowest ration of 0.75 A were sufficient to ensure normal growth and intermoult duration until Stage II. When phyllosoma were fed for an extended period (several moults), low ration and high phyllosoma density resulted in smaller size and extended intermoult duration. Fluctuations in the feeding pattern of phyllosoma. were evident between treatments during the experiment. Phyllosoma with access to more Artemia consumed more, and consumption was reduced prior to a moult, even during early stages of development. The second phase of the study examined the intake of 1.7 mm juvenile Artemia by phyllosoma and their response to flow-induced turbulence with a combination of two water exchange rates (2.5 or 5 times h(-1)) and two inlet positions (2 cm above the water surface or 0.5 cm above the culture vessel bottom and parallel to it). Larvae exposed to slow flow were larger and had a shorter intermoult duration associated with an increased ability to capture and consume more Artemia. Similar numbers of Artemia were consumed during the intermoult in high flow treatments compared to the low flow, albeit over a longer duration. Phyllosoma development between moults required less Artemia to be consumed under static conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, recent studies have highlighted that population tolerance to MHWs is variable, with some populations even benefitting from MHWs. A number of factors can explain variation in responses between populations including their genetic variation, previous thermal experience and the cumulative heatwave intensity (degrees C d) of the heatwave itself. We disentangle the contributions of these factors on population mortality and post-heatwave growth rates by experimentally simulating heatwaves (7.5 or 9.2 degrees C, for up to 9 days) for three genotypes of the Southern Ocean diatom Actinocyclus actinochilus. The effects of simulated heatwaves on mortality and population growth rates varied with genotype, thermal experience and the cumulative intensity of the heatwave itself. Firstly, hotter and longer heatwaves increased mortality and decreased post-heatwave growth rates relative to milder, shorter heatwaves. Secondly, growth above the thermal optimum before heatwaves exacerbated heatwave-associated negative effects, leading to increased mortality during heatwaves and slower growth after heatwaves. Thirdly, hotter and longer heatwaves resulted in more pronounced changes to thermal optima (T-opt) immediately following heatwaves. Finally, there is substantial intraspecific variation in post-heatwave growth rates. Our findings shed light on the potential of Southern Ocean diatoms to tolerate MHWs, which will increase both in frequency and in intensity under future climate change.",,,,,,"Rynearson, Tatiana/0000-0003-2951-0066",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,JAN 27,2021,8,,,,,,,,600343,10.3389/fmars.2021.600343,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.600343,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000615271400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, we do not know where in the peat profile these gases are produced and how controlling factors, such as substrate quality, which can vary substantially with peat age, and anoxic-oxic conditions, interact to determine production rates. To address this knowledge gap, this study investigated if substrate limitation of CO2 and CH4 production differs under anoxic-oxic peat conditions using entire peat profiles, from tropical peatlands in Panama. We determined the variation in peat organic chemistry through stratigraphic profiles using tetramethylammonium-pyrolysis-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TMAH-Py-GC/IVIS). To explore how variation in peat organic chemistry through the depth profile impacted on CO2 and CH4 production rates under anoxic-oxic conditions we carried out a series of incubation experiments. The TMAH-Py-GC/MS analysis showed high concentrations of long chain fatty acids (>C-20) in surface peat, and variation in the distribution of the lignin monomers through the peat profile. Both anoxic CH4 and CO2 production was greatest from the surface of the peat profile with surface peat accounting for 92 1.7 and 54 2.9% of the cumulative CH4 and CO2 production, respectively. The high CO2 and CH4 production rate under anoxic conditions, in surface peat, was strongly related to greater concentrations of lignin, but also long chain fatty acids and polysaccharides, in this section of the peat profile. As expected, CH4 production decreased, and became decoupled from peat organic chemistry, following peat aeration. In contrast, aeration dramatically increased CO2 emissions throughout the entire peat profile. This demonstrates that the recalcitrance of buried peat does not protect C stocks in tropical peatlands, if their water tables are lowered in response to drainage or prolonged drought. In conclusion, our work highlight that information on both labile substrate availability and water table fluctuation are needed to predict CO2 and CH4 fluxes from tropical peatlands.

As a first attempt to measure eddy fluxes of momentum and buoyancy, in order to quantify the mixing in this region, we have carried out a 5-day pilot experiment on a sloping side of Emerald Basin on the Scotian Shelf. A moored upward-looking 1.2 MHz ADCP and a thermistor chain mounted along its vertical axis returned analyzable data between 8 and 17 m above the bottom at one-minute intervals. An extensive set of microstructure profiles was also obtained. The predominantly tidal flow regime causes the bottom boundary layer thickness to vary between 3 < z < 30 m, with most high frequency activity during the upslope phase. A bottom-normal momentum flux significantly different from zero is found in the cross-isobath direction only. The main contribution comes from a band near the buoyancy frequency N, possibly indicative of advective or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. When cast in terms of mean-flow shear, the stress yields an eddy viscosity A approximate to 9 x 10(-3) m(2) s(-1) within the boundary layer and twice this value at z = 15 m, the average height of the pycnocline that caps the boundary layer. The buoyancy flux also seems to be dominated by fluctuating signals near N, but is countergradient and only significantly different from zero at a height of about 15 m. The associated restratification occurs in short periods of approximately one hour when isotherms rise rapidly. Indirect evidence for the importance of the tertiary circulation within the boundary layer is found from the gradient of stress divergence and the mean bottom-normal velocity. An approximate turbulent kinetic energy balance has been investigated, with the currents split into three parts (mean, tidal, and the high frequency part of the internal waveband (''turbulence'')). Production balances viscous dissipation within a factor of 2. Turbulent kinetic energy production by interaction between the turbulent Reynolds stress and the mean flow shear and tidal shear are of the same order of magnitude, but the buoyancy term appears to be of equal importance at the pycnocline.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2402,1543-9542,,,,SEP,1994,52,5,,,,,909,946,,10.1357/0022240943076876,http://dx.doi.org/10.1357/0022240943076876,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PK14800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such hedging reduces yields, largely through competition for carbohydrates between early fruit set and the post-pruning vegetative flush, but also through a reduction in photosynthetic capacity caused by the loss of canopy. We examined whether hedging at other times might mitigate yield losses. Hedging time was found to affect yields across four cultivars: 'A4', 'A38', '344' and '816'. Yield losses were lower for trees hedged in November-December than for trees hedged in September. Yields for trees hedged in June were higher than for trees hedged in September in one experiment, but were similar in a second experiment. Yield losses for September and October hedging were similar. Hedging time changed the pattern of fluctuations in stem water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC). WSC declined shortly after hedging in September, October or November, and the declines preceded increases in fruit abscission relative to unpruned control trees. The increase in fruit abscission was less pronounced for the trees hedged in November, consistent with the idea that fruit become less sensitive to carbon limitation as they mature.",,,,,"Kristiansen, Paul/X-6638-2019","Kristiansen, Paul/0000-0003-2116-0663",,,,,,,,,,,,,1445-4408,1445-4416,,,,,2012,39,6,,,,,481,492,,10.1071/FP11254,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP11254,,,,,,,,32480799,,,,,WOS:000304667900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, the habitat of river organisms can be linked to a long list of relevant variables, including hydraulics, channel form, substrate composition, water quality, irradiance, and abundance of organic matter. Habitat preferences are well known for some species, particularly salmonids, but large uncertainties remain for many taxa. River habitats are not composed of static features; instead the features fluctuate as the result of a large set of processes acting from the basin to the local scale. Local processes of importance in shaping river habitats include (depending on river type) channel migration, growth and mortality of riparian trees, formation of wood jams, storage of organic matter, macrophyte development, and travertine deposition. Sometimes it is possible to assess the positive or negative effect of a given process for a particular species, but most often researchers rely on the patterns of physical habitat rather than on the processes that shape these habitats. As an example of the adjustment of river habitats to local processes, we show data from an experiment in which large wood was reintroduced to a small mountain stream. Wood jams produced large effects on hydraulics and substrate, large increases in the storage of organic matter, increases in invertebrate and fish densities, and changes in ecosystem functioning. This example emphasises the tight relationship between riparian dynamics and in-stream habitat, and the importance of local processes, in this case inputs of large wood to streams. Therefore, the assessment and management of river habitats must take into account not only the habitat itself but also key local processes that are essential for the long-term continuity of this habitat.",,,,,"Díez, José Ramón/R-8517-2018; Elosegi, Arturo/B-7796-2009","Díez, José Ramón/0000-0003-3967-0186; Elosegi, Arturo/0000-0001-8809-8484",,,,,,,,,,,,,0213-8409,1989-1806,,,,DEC,2011,30,2,,,,,183,196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000298769700003,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Lundholm, JT",,,,"Lundholm, Jeremy T.",,,Green roof plant species diversity improves ecosystem multifunctionality,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Constructed ecosystems such as green roofs often contain monocultures or low-diversity plant communities, but adding more plant species to these systems can increase ecosystem service provisioning. Mixture advantage, when species-rich treatments outperform the best monocultures, is desirable in constructed ecosystems due to the cost of increasing diversity. However, there have not been any studies in constructed ecosystems that have quantitatively compared mixtures with the best monocultures for multifunctionality, and there have been few studies that have examined how provision of ecosystem services changes over time as plant communities develop. In a green roof system, I predicted (i) that the mixture advantage would be stronger for ecosystem multifunctionality than for single ecosystem functions and (ii) that ecosystem service provisioning and complementarity in above-ground biomass would increase over time. Fifteen monocultures of plant species from five life-form groups (succulents, tall forbs, dwarf shrubs, creeping forbs, grasses) were compared with three-species mixtures of the same life-form and mixtures of species from three and five different life-forms in a modular green roof system. Indicators of ecosystem services including above-ground production, thermal regulation, stormwater retention, nutrient uptake and carbon sequestration and two indices of ecosystem multifunctionality were compared. Canopy density increased over time while substrate temperature decreased, suggesting higher provisioning of valuable ecosystem services. For single services, the positive relationship between planted species richness and ecosystem service grew stronger over time, but was consistently strong over time for multifunctionality. Quantile regression indicated a weak mixture advantage for several services including both multifunctionality indices. While the effects were small, different species optimized different functions, thus multifunctioning is enhanced in more diverse mixtures by combining species that maximize different functions. Tripartite partitioning of canopy density showed that overyielding and trait-independent complementarity fluctuated between years in response to shifts in species abundances, but dominance and trait-dependent complementarity increased over time.Synthesis and applications. This study provides the first evidence in a constructed ecosystem that mixtures can outperform the best monocultures for multiple ecosystem services. Mixtures of plant life-forms can improve green roof performance. The biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships observed in natural ecosystems can also occur in novel and highly simplified engineered ecosystems.

The study covered one annual cycle, reflecting the effect of endogenous and exogenous factors. Respiration (6-29 mu mol C g(-1) h(-1)), ammonia (0.3-22 mu mol N g(-1) h(-1)) and phosphate (<0.3 mu mol P g(-1) h(-1)) excretion were correlated to food (POC) and temperature. Tissue nitrogen (127-167 mg N g(-1)), carbon (547-629 mg C g(-1)) and phosphorus content (547-629 mg P g(-1)) seemed related to reproductive processes. Nutrient turnover showed a seasonal pattern with fast turnover in summer and slow turnover in winter. On an annual basis, nitrogen turnover (643 days) was slower compared to phosphorus (290 days) and carbon (181 days). Fluctuations in biodeposition rates (11-72 mg g(-1)) were correlated to food parameters. Although the food concentration in our study area was low (Chl a<2 mu g l(-1); POC<546 mu g l(-1)) and food quality high (CN similar to 9), physiological rates, except biodeposition, were similar to rates reported in other cultivation areas. The relative importance of each of the processes determines how mussels contribute to nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems. Respiration and excretion of dissolved metabolites (1639 mg C, 92 mg N. 23 mg P g(-1) y(-1)) is regarded as a source of regenerated nutrients and may enhance nutrient availability in the euphotic zone with potential consequences for phytoplankton dynamics. Nutrient accumulation in tissue material (560 mg C, 168 mg N, 12 mg P g(-1) y(-1)) is regarded as a sink of nutrients given that mussels will be harvested. Biodeposition (981 mg C, 113 mg N, 9 mg P g(-1) y(-1)) is regarded as another nutrient sink in fjord ecosystems, although a fraction is regenerated in the euphotic zone. This shows a dissimilar allocation of elements to each of the physiological processes, resulting in relatively more nitrogen being accumulated in tissue material, and relatively more phosphorus being regenerated. The relatively high fraction of regenerated nutrients (25-53%) and the low fraction of nutrients allocated to biodeposition (20-31%) indicates that the potential role of mussels in nutrient cycling in oligotrophic Fjord systems is different from shallow eutrophic areas.

Here, from multiple data sources, we composited control experiments of 25 major rice cultivars in Northeast China, which allows determining the genetic differences in chilling tolerance. The results suggest that newer released rice cultivars tend to resist stronger chilling than older cultivars, and there is a coexistence between high-yielding and more chilling tolerance. By projecting the above statistical relationship to regional yield, our analysis indicates that the lower chilling sensitivity due to such breeding progress may reduce yield fluctuation by approximately 74% in the lousy harvest year since 1960.

Assessment of photosynthetic competency on large scales remains challenging, but phytoplankton chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) is a signal that holds promise in this respect as it is affected by, and consequently provides information about, the photosynthetic efficiency of the organism. A second process affecting the ChlF signal is heat dissipation of absorbed light energy, referred to as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). NPQ is triggered when excess energy is absorbed, i.e. when more light is absorbed than can be used directly for photosynthetic carbon fixation. The effect of NPQ on the ChlF signal complicates its interpretation in terms of photosynthetic efficiency, and therefore most approaches relating ChlF parameters to photosynthetic efficiency seek to minimize the influence of NPQ by working under conditions of sub-saturating irradiance. Here, we propose that NPQ itself holds potential as an easily acquired optical signal indicative of phytoplankton physiological state with respect to Fe limitation. We present data from a research voyage to the Subantarctic Zone south of Australia. Incubation experiments confirmed that resident phytoplankton were Fe-limited, as the maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry, F-v/F-m, measured with a fast repetition rate fluorometer (FRRf), increased significantly with Fe addition. The NPQ capacity of the phytoplankton also showed sensitivity to Fe addition, decreasing with increased Fe availability, confirming previous work. The fortuitous presence of a remnant warm-core eddy in the vicinity of the study area allowed comparison of fluorescence behaviour between two distinct water masses, with the colder water showing significantly lower F-v/F-m than the warmer eddy waters, suggesting a difference in Fe limitation status between the two water masses. Again, NPQ capacity measured with the FRRf mirrored the behaviour observed in F-v/F-m, decreasing as F-v/F-m increased in the warmer water mass. We also analysed the diel quenching of underway fluorescence measured with a standard fluorometer, such as is frequently used to monitor ambient chlorophyll a concentrations, and found a significant difference in behaviour between the two water masses. This difference was quantified by defining an NPQ parameter akin to the Stern-Volmer parameterization of NPQ, exploiting the fluorescence quenching induced by diel fluctuations in incident irradiance. We propose that monitoring of this novel NPQ parameter may enable assessment of phytoplankton physiological status (related to Fe availability) based on measurements made with standard fluorometers, as ubiquitously used on moorings, ships, floats and gliders.",,,,,"Schallenberg, Christina/N-4187-2017; Strzepek, Robert/GQH-8703-2022; Strzepek, Robert/A-1216-2011","Schallenberg, Christina/0000-0002-3073-7500; Schuback, Nina/0000-0001-9535-0086; Strzepek, Robert/0000-0002-6442-7121; Clementson, Lesley/0000-0003-4415-993X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,FEB 17,2020,17,3,,,,,793,812,,10.5194/bg-17-793-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-793-2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000515166900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The light environment and mixing regime within the mesocosm were comparable to those in shallow lakes and coastal waters. Experiments showed no significant differences for 24-h mean and 7-day mean chlorophyll a and carbon-specific growth for mixed depths of 1 m and 3 m, and mixing times between 4 min and 65 min. Fluctuations in irradiance brought about by turbulent mixing had no significant effect on specific growth. The relationship between mixed depths and critical depths for S. costatum was therefore independent of fluctuations in irradiance in the turbulent mixed layer. The results indicated that to control growth of S. costatum mixed depths would have to exceed photic depths by a factor of 15, instead of the conventionally accepted factor of 5.

We also tested their surrogate value. Spiders were found to have higher species richness and abundance almost throughout the investigation. Orthoptera had lower species richness and abundance in forests compared to grasslands and maquis, while no significant difference between habitats was revealed for spiders. Early-summer was the richest period for spiders while mid-summer was the richest for Orthoptera. Canopy cover was found to significantly influence community composition of both groups, while herb height and cover of stones was a determinant factor for Orthoptera only. There was a significant congruence between the two groups and Orthoptera provided the best complementary network. Our results show that diversity patterns of both spiders and Orthoptera are sensitive to environmental changes even over short time-scales (e.g. within the summer period) and space (e.g. across different habitat types), suggesting that small inexpensive experimental designs may still reveal community dynamics.

Particular morphs are adapted to different windows of opportunity for germination in the seasonally fluctuating and heterogeneous salt-marsh environment. The possibility that plants derived from the two morphs may also differ physiologically has not been investigated previously. Methods Experiments were designed to investigate the germination characteristics of black and brown seed morphs of Suaeda splendens, an annual, C-4 shrub of non-tidal, saline steppes. The resulting seedlings were transferred to hydroponic culture to investigate their growth and photosynthetic (PSII photochemistry and gas exchange) responses to salinity. Key Results Black seeds germinated at low salinity but were particularly sensitive to increasing salt concentrations, and strongly inhibited by light. Brown seeds were unaffected by light, able to germinate at higher salinities and generally germinated more rapidly. Ungerminated black seeds maintained viability for longer than brown ones, particularly at high salinity. Seedlings derived from both seed morphs grew well at high salinity (400 mol m(-3) NaCl). However, seedlings derived from brown seeds performed poorly at low salinity, as reflected in relative growth rate, numbers of branches produced, F-v/F-m and net rate of CO2 assimilation. Conclusions The seeds most likely to germinate at high salinity in the Mediterranean summer (brown ones) retain a requirement for higher salinity as seedlings that might be of adaptive value. On the other hand, black seeds, which are likely to delay germination until lower salinity prevails, produce seedlings that are less sensitive to salinity. It is not clear why performance at low salinity, later in the life cycle, might have been sacrificed by the brown seeds, to achieve higher fitness at the germination stage under high salinity. Analyses of adaptive syndromes associated with seed dimorphism may need to take account of differences over the entire life cycle, rather than just at the germination stage.",,,,,"Figueroa Clemente, Manuel Enrique/L-7577-2014; Cambrollé, Jesús/G-7133-2012; Davy, Anthony J/E-1542-2011; Mateos-Naranjo, Enrique/F-1782-2016; Redondo-Gómez, Susana/E-6783-2010","Figueroa Clemente, Manuel Enrique/0000-0002-8806-4054; Cambrollé, Jesús/0000-0002-9750-6328; Davy, Anthony J/0000-0002-7658-7106; Mateos-Naranjo, Enrique/0000-0001-6276-5664; Redondo-Gómez, Susana/0000-0002-5280-9325; Luque Palomo, Teresa/0000-0001-8512-3584",,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,JUL,2008,102,1,,,,,103,112,,10.1093/aob/mcn069,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcn069,,,,,,,,18463109,,,,,WOS:000256976900012,View Full Record in Web of Science

While many anurans offer relevant opportunities to study parental care, research on how parents respond to environmental variation and offspring conditions are lacking. In this study, we investigated the interrelationships of weather, embryo hydration demands, and parental provisioning in a wild population of the glassfrog Hyalinobatrachium ('Centrolenella') fleischmanni in Oaxaca, Mexico. We determined whether males modify parental behavior in response to changes in weather conditions that effect embryo dehydration, how variation in both weather and parental hydration affect egg water balance and embryonic mortality, and whether parental provisioning is related to the hydration levels of egg clutches. We found that male H. fleischmanni compensate for environmental variation in offspring conditions by adjusting the frequency of parental care in response to both weather and egg dehydration. Using a male removal experiment, we examined the function of paternal care and made comparisons with previous research, finding that both the adaptive value of parental care and flexibility in parental behavior are impacted by spatial and temporal conditions. We present observations that indicate a direct conflict between providing parental care and multiple matings. In summary, this research demonstrates that the variable frequency of paternal care in H. fleischmanni is a response to the fluctuating nature of the climate and resulting hydration requirements of embryos in combination with the allocation of effort to parental care versus mating activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,,,APR,2013,67,4,,,,,557,569,,10.1007/s00265-013-1475-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-013-1475-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000316118400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This leads to biased coefficients and reconstructions with artificially low variance. Second, we show that inversion of the relationship is often done incorrectly when the underlying causal relationship is dynamic in nature. We show analytically as well as using Monte Carlo experiments and actual tree ring data, that the reverse regression method results in biased coefficients, reconstructions with artificially low variance and overly smooth reconstructions.

Bacterial communities of Baltic seawater and sea ice from a coastal site in southwest Finland were used in two batch culture experiments run for 17 or 18 days at 0 degrees C. Bacterial abundance, cell volume, and leucine and thymidine incorporation were measured during the experiments. The bacterial community structure was assessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified partial 16S rRNA genes with sequencing of DGGE bands from initial communities and communities of day 10 or 13 of the experiment. The sea ice-derived bacterial community was metabolically more active than the open-water community at the start of the experiment. Ice-derived bacterial communities were able to adapt to salinity change with smaller effects on physiology and community structure, whereas in the open-water bacterial communities, the bacterial cell volume evolution, bacterial abundance, and community structure responses indicated the presence of salinity stress. The closest relatives for all eight partial 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained were either organisms found in polar sea ice and other cold habitats or those found in summertime Baltic seawater. All sequences except one were associated with the alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria or the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group.

Regional and ecosystem-based studies show that water table position generally controls CH4 emission from boreal peatlands by influencing the relative extent of the zones of CH4 oxidation and production within the peat profile. We used a combined field and laboratory study to assess the influence of local hydrology on the short-term dynamics of CH4 production, oxidation, and emission from sites in an Alaskan boreal peatland that were characterized by temporarily (site LB1A) and permanently (LB2) water-saturated subsurface peat during the thaw season. The two sites contrasted sharply with respect to the dynamics of CH4 cycling. Site LB1A, which showed low CH4 concentrations in pore water (<2 mu M) and unsaturated peat (<2.6 nM), consumed both atmospheric CH4 and CH4 diffusing upward from the saturated zone for a net flux of 0.9 mg CH4 m(2) d(1). In contrast, LB2 had pore water CH4 concentrations, 300 mu M and emitted CH4 at 69 mg m(2) d(1). Roughly 55% of the CH4 diffusing upward from the saturated zone at LB2 was oxidized in transit to the peat surface. Methane oxidation potentials (V-ox) were maximum in the 10-cm zone immediately above the local water table at both sites but were greater on a dry mass (dw) basis at LB2 (498-650 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)) than at LB1A (220-233 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)). Methane production potentials (V-p) were low (<2 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)) at LB1A, but the maximum at LB2 (139 ng CH4 g(dw)(1) h(1)) was spatially coupled with the maximum V-ox. Methanogens exposed to O-2 produced no CH4 in a subsequent 48 h anoxic incubation, whereas methanotrophs incubated anoxically oxidized CH4 vigorously within 20 h of return to an oxic environment, indicating that the former are more sensitive than the latter to adverse O-2 conditions.

Field and laboratory investigations were combined in a 2-year study on the initiation of a midsummer decline of Daphnia galeata Sars in a hypertrophic reservoir. Quantitative field samples were taken twice a week, and, adult and juvenile mortality rates were calculated. Patterns of reproduction and survival of daphnids born during spring and early summer under fluctuating food conditions were determined in life-table experiments. 2. The abundance of Daphnia increased strongly in early May and declined in June 1998 (midsummer decline). In 1999, Daphnia density increased only slowly in spring and remained constantly high throughout the summer. 3. Food conditions (concentrations of POC<30 mu m) for daphnids deteriorated in both years in response to increasing Daphnia densities, resulting in a clear-water phase of about 4 weeks. When Daphnia abundance declined in 1998, POC<30 mu m concentrations increased greatly, whereas in 1999 food conditions improved only slightly and Secchi depth remained high. 4. Survival of daphnids in life-table experiments decreased greatly after food became rare and was strongly reduced in those animals born during the clear-water phase compared with those born later. In addition, age at first reproduction was retarded during the clear-water phase, resulting in very low population growth rates. Survivorship patterns in life-table experiments suggest a strong impact of non-consumptive mortality on Daphnia population dynamics. 5. Field data of mortality point to differences in mortality patterns between years, probably resulting from different predation impacts of juvenile fish. In both years, however, adult mortality contributed substantially to overall mortality at the end of the clear-water phase. As bottom-up effects on D. galeata were very similar in both years, the significance of non-consumptive mortality on the initiation of midsummer declines appears to depend largely on recruitment patterns before the clear-water phase. A high impact can be expected when Daphnia populations are dominated by a peak cohort of nearly identical age during the clear-water phase.",,,,,"Hülsmann, Stephan/N-3889-2018; Hülsmann, Stephan/K-9146-2015","Hülsmann, Stephan/0000-0002-9569-7626; Hülsmann, Stephan/0000-0002-9569-7626",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,DEC,2002,47,12,,,,,2313,2324,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00991.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00991.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000179382700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Extensive empirical evidence on marine piscivorous fish at higher latitudes confirms that the episodic capacity scales almost linearly with predator body mass (exponent approximately 0.95), producing an increasing factorial hyperphagic scope (exponent approximately 0.20). Our synthesis overturns the reigning steady state perspective on assimilative capacity. The fish can utilize an episodic capacity, typically twice the size of the sustained capacity, resulting in local dynamics of functional responses with profound implications for scaling-up to ecosystem level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,DEC,2021,78,10,,,,,3615,3624,,10.1093/icesjms/fsab197,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsab197,,OCT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000743855700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Wu, TN; Wu, H",,,,"Wu, Tianning; Wu, Hui",,,Tidal Mixing Sustains a Bottom-Trapped River Plume and Buoyant Coastal Current on an Energetic Continental Shelf,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Conventional wisdoms on river plume dynamics suggest that a down-shelf buoyant coastal current will ultimately be trapped at a specific depth, that is, the trapping depth, as constrained by riverine outflow and offshore bottom Ekman transport. Theoretically, a prerequisite down-shelf current is necessary to form a stable bottom-trapped river plume. In this study an alternative is described by carrying out a modeling study on the Zhe-Min Coastal Current (ZMCC). Buoyant water from the Changjiang River is a major factor driving the ZMCC, as is common in bottom-trapped river plumes; however, the trapping depth is more determined by tidal mixing. When the plume water comes to the sloping topography, strong tidal mixing induces a mixing front, shoreward of which the bottom Ekman layer occupies the entire water column. Such a tidal-induced front maintains a down-shelf frontal current, which is intensified both at the surface due to the thermal wind balance and on the top of bottom boundary layer due to the tidal rectification. Direct wind-induced transport only covers a small fraction of the ZMCC; however, it redistributes the plume water and, thus, affects the coastal current. The tide-induced frontal trapping depth varies much less between seasons than that predicted by previous plume theories. Instead, it fluctuates strongly in the spring-neap cycle. Even in summer when upwelling-favorable winds prevail, the mixing front still sustains a down-shelf coastal current. Intense tidal mixing exists in many coastal waters, which might be an alternative mechanism in forming bottom-trapped river plumes and their associated buoyant coastal current. Plain Language Summary Large rivers, such as the Amazon, Mississippi, and Changjiang, export a huge amount of terrestrial materials to the receiving waterbodies. Typically, the lighter riverine freshwater mixes with the denser ambient seawater and then propagates rightward along the coast (in the Northern Hemisphere), which is known as the buoyant coastal current. Large river-induced buoyant coastal current can propagate hundreds of kilometers. It frequently causes harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, and other environmental problems. Therefore, understanding the formation mechanisms of buoyant coastal currents is very important. Conventional theories on buoyant coastal currents are very successful; however, they rarely consider the effect of tidal mixing, which exists ubiquitously in coastal waters. Here in this study, we investigated this issue by using the Changjiang River-induced buoyant coastal current as an example, through a series of well-designed numerical experiments. The results showed that tidal mixing plays an essential role in maintaining a stable buoyant coastal current under unfavorable wind conditions. Without the tidal mixing, the stable buoyant coastal current can hardly exist. The finding of this study can promote our understandings on the coastal dynamic processes and other relevant processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,NOV,2018,123,11,,,,,8026,8051,,10.1029/2018JC014105,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014105,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000453907000020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The developed ANN models performed well in hindcasting TWSA for the plateau and its three sub-regions (i.e., the upper Mekong River, Pearl River, and Wujiang River basins), showing coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.91, 0.83, 0.76, and 0.57, respectively. The intensified climate extremes are indicative of large changes in the hydrological cycle and brought great challenges in water resource management there. The TWSA of the plateau remained fairly stable during the 1980s, and featured an increasing trend at a rate of 5.9 +/- 0.5 mm/a in the 1990s interspersed extreme flooding in 1991 and during the second half of the 1990s. Since 2000, the TWSA fluctuated drastically, featuring severe spring droughts from 2003 to 2006, the most extreme spring drought on record in 2010, and severe flooding in 2008. The TWSA of the upper Mekong has decreased by similar to 100 mm (similar to 15 km(3)) compared with that at the end of the 1990s.

The red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla originates from the NW Pacific but has recently spread along the coastlines of Western Europe, where it has become abundant in many shallow, soft-bottom estuaries. Salinity is important for the local and regional distribution of algae. The distribution of G. vermiculophylla in Europe suggests that it thrives well in hyposaline environments and that it may be more fit than some native algae under such conditions. Little, however, is known about the ecophysiology of G. vermiculophylla and it is therefore difficult to predict its spread and future distribution. Laboratory experiments with G. vermiculophylla showed that steady-state salinity above 15 psu was optimal for growth and that the growth rate was reduced at salinities below 15 psu. Variable salinity reduced the growth rate and larger oscillations were more stressful than small ones. Exposure to very low salinity (0-5 psu) was stressful for the alga and algae exposed to these low levels for 2-4 days were unable to recover fully. Gracilaria vermiculophylla did not seem to perform better in hyposaline conditions than many native, estuarine species. The present distribution of G. vermiculophylla in Scandinavia can be explained well by its response to salinity, but this may not explain its present success relative to many naturally occurring algal species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0967-0262,,,,,,2012,47,3,,,,,254,263,,10.1080/09670262.2012.702225,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2012.702225,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000308435700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

There was no difference between the cultivars in leaf photosynthetic rate from mid-July to mid-October. The extent of watercore in 'Orin' increased from mid-July and peaked in late-August, followed by a decrease through mid-October, while no watercore was detected during the experimental period in 'Fuji'. Fruit fresh weight and soluble solids content (SSC) were higher in 'Orin' than 'Fuji' during the earlier stages. Leaf dry weight of 'Orin' was higher than that of 'Fuji' throughout the experimental period. Accumulation of dry matter in the fruit increased in both cultivars and 'Orin' kept significantly higher level than 'Fuji' from mid-July to mid-October. The amount of (13)C distributed to 'Orin' fruit at 5 clays after labeling was significantly higher than 'Fuji' in mid-July just before watercore started to occur. (13)C taken up by 'Orin' fruit with prevalent watercore was also higher than 'Fuji' in late-August but the difference was not significant. In mid-October when early watercore was gradually reducing, (13)C recovered by 'Orin' fruit decreased and was significantly lower than 'Fuji'. The difference of partitioning pattern of (13)C between the cultivars was associated with the susceptibility to early watercore as well as the changes in fruit growth and SSC. The seasonal changes in the amount of (13)C distributed to 'Orin' fruit were also related to the fluctuations in watercore severity. The results suggest that active phloem transport might be the cause of early watercore in our previous work, which might be induced by the increased partitioning of assimilates to the fruit during summer in susceptible 'Orin' compared to resistant 'Fuji' and not by the higher potential of leaf photosynthesis.

A key life-history tradeoff is the production of offspring size versus number, ranging from many small offspring to few large offspring. Models show that this life-history tradeoff in offspring size and number, through maturation time, can have significant impacts on population dynamics. However, few manipulative experiments have been conducted that can isolate life-history effects from impacts of extrinsic factors in consumer-resource systems. We experimentally tested the effect of an offspring size-number tradeoff on population stability and food availability in a consumer-resource system. Using Daphnia pulex, we created a shift from many, small offspring being produced to fewer, larger offspring. Two sets of experiments were performed to examine the interaction of an extrinsic factor (light levels) and intrinsic population structure on dynamics, and we controlled for the ingestion pressure on algal prey at the time of the manipulation. We predicted that the tradeoff would impact internal consumer population characteristics, including biasing the stage structure towards adults, increasing adult size, and increasing average population-level reproduction. This adult-dominated stage structure was predicted to then lead to instability and a low quantity-high quality food state. Under all light levels, the manipulated populations became dominated by large adults. Contrary to predictions, the amplitudes of fluctuations in Daphnia biomass were lower in populations shifted to few-large offspring, representing higher stability in these populations. Furthermore, in high light conditions, a stable low Daphnia - high algae biomass (low food quality) state was observed in few-large offspring treatments but not in control (many-small offspring) treatments.

The possibility that the performance of E. abietinum is reduced on previously infested Sitka spruce, and that this is the cause of year-to-year fluctuations in population density, was investigated by comparing population development and the growth rate of individual aphids on experimentally defoliated trees. 2 Separate experiments were performed to determine whether aphid performance was reduced either in the autumn immediately after defoliation in the spring, or was reduced in the spring of the next year. Different rates of initial defoliation on trees used to test aphid performance were created by artificially infesting the trees with aphids in the spring before the experiments, and varying the time of infestation. 3 Population development and the mean relative growth rate (MRGR) of individual aphids on previously defoliated and undefoliated Sitka spruce did not differ significantly in the spring of the next year. No differences were observed in the nutrient content of the 1-year-old needles of previously defoliated or undefoliated trees at this time. 4 In the autumn and winter immediately after spring defoliation, aphid MRGR was significantly higher on trees that had been heavily defoliated earlier in the season compared with trees that had been lightly defoliated. However, the difference in MRGR decreased over the winter period. Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium concentrations were 9.4-12.2% higher, at the beginning of the autumn, in the current year needles of heavily defoliated trees than in the current year needles of lightly defoliated trees. 5 The experiments indicate that high populations of E. abietinum in the spring do not induce any defensive mechanisms in Sitka spruce that adversely affect subsequent generations of the aphid.

These unusual conditions have spawned several field programs and laboratory experiments to determine why this high nitrate-low chlorophyll pattern persists in this region. To synthesize the results from these field programs, as well as providing additional evidence in support of the iron hypothesis, we developed a one-dimensional, nine-component ecosystem model of 0 degrees N 140 degrees W. The model components include two phytoplankton size fractions, two zooplankton size fractions, two detrital size fractions, dissolved iron, nitrate, and ammonium. The model was run for 5 years (1990-1994) and was forced using an atmospheric radiative transfer model, an ocean general circulation model (GCM), and in situ data. To our knowledge, this is the first ecosystem model at 0 degrees N 140 degrees W to synthesize the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study Equatorial Pacific Process Study (JGOFS EqPac) data set, as well as to use both in situ and modeled physical data to drive the model. Modeled phytoplankton, zooplankton, and iron all varied on interannual timescales due to El Nino events. Total phytoplankton biomass increased by as much as 40% from early 1992 (El Nino warm) to 1993 (normal). The results also indicate that the biomass increase during a cool period is not constant for each phytoplankton component, but instead the increase is most evident in the netphytoplankton (>10 mu m). Netphytoplankton increase from a low of 0.1% of the total chlorophyll in 1992 to a high of 30% of the total in 1993. Microzooplankton grazing rates fluctuated in response to changes in nanophytoplankton growth rates, whereas mesozooplankton grazing was unrelated to netphytoplankton growth rates. The magnitude and temporal variability of phytoplankton chlorophyll agreed well with in situ data collected during 1992. Modeled primary production was lower than measured during El Nino but agreed with observations during normal conditions. The low primary productivity was probably a result of downwelling produced by the physical model.

For the Antarctic ice sheet, we find that volume changes are closely linked with grounding line changes of the West Antarctic ice sheet. At the LGM, the grounding line extended close to the continental shelf break almost everywhere. Ice over central East Antarctica was generally thinner than today and varied mainly in accordance with accumulation fluctuations. For the Greenland ice sheet, melting is important only during interglacial periods and the most sensitive period concerns the size of the ice sheet during the Eemian. At the LGM, the Greenland ice sheet extended beyond the present coastline to cover at least the inner continental shelf and thinned by up to several hundred meters in central areas. For a plausible range of parameters, the experiments indicate that at the time of maximum sea-level depression (21 kyr BP), the Antarctic ice sheet contributed 14-18 m to the sea-level lowering, and the Greenland ice sheet 2-3 in, significantly less than the older CLIMAP reconstructions. Whereas both ice sheets were at 21 kyr BP close to their maximum. extent, the experiments also indicate that their maximum volumes were reached only by 16.5 kyr BP (Greenland) and 10 kyr BP (Antarctica), equal to an additional sea-level lowering of, respectively, 0.4 and 3.7 in. Holocene retreat was essentially complete by 5 kyr BP in Greenland, but is found to still continue today in West Antarctica before reversing to growth during the next millenium. The models were found to reproduce gross features of the ice sheet's history since the LGM in reasonably good agreement with available glacial-geological data, although observational control on ice thickness changes remains very limited.

These fluctuations affect soil water availability, a crucial driver of soil microbial activity. While these fluctuations are leaving imprints on soil microbiome structures, the question remains if the legacy of one type of weather fluctuation (e.g., drying-rewetting) affects the community response to the other (e.g., freezing-thawing). As both phenomenons give similar water availability fluctuations, we hypothesized that freezing-thawing and drying-rewetting cycles have similar effects on the soil microbiome. We tested this hypothesis by establishing targeted microcosm experiments. We created a legacy by exposing soil samples to a freezing-thawing or drying-rewetting cycle (phase 1), followed by an additional drying-rewetting or freezing-thawing cycle (phase 2). We measured soil respiration and analyzed soil microbiome structures. Across experiments, larger CO2 pulses and changes in microbiome structures were observed after rewetting than thawing. Drying-rewetting legacy affected the microbiome and CO2 emissions upon the following freezing-thawing cycle. Conversely, freezing-thawing legacy did not affect the microbial response to the drying-rewetting cycle.

Previous experiments have focused on comparisons between eggs maintained under constant ( but different) conditions, but eggs in natural nests frequently experience strong temporal shifts in soil water content during incubation. Keelback snakes ( Tropidonophis mairii) in the Australian wet-dry tropics nest over most of the year, so early nests experience decreasing water availability during development, late nests experience increases, and others ( midyear) remain stable in this respect. We mimicked these three conditions and incubated 54 eggs ( nine from each of six clutches) in a split-clutch design to maintain the same average water content but with differing trajectories through incubation. The experimental treatments significantly affected the total amount of water taken up by the eggs ( and thus final egg mass), but incubation periods were unaffected. Hatchling size but not strength showed minor but statistically significant effects of incubation regimes. The ability of keelback eggs to take up excess water whenever it becomes available ( either early or late in development) and to retain it even when conditions change buffers embryogenesis effectively ( but not completely) against fluctuations in soil water conditions.",,,,,"Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008; Brown, Gregory P./F-9897-2011","Brown, Gregory P./0000-0002-2924-9040",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,1537-5293,,,,JUL-AUG,2005,78,4,,,,,524,530,,10.1086/430231,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/430231,,,,,,,,15957107,,,,,WOS:000229979300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three hour gut evacuation experiments were conducted to determine the gut evacuation rate and potential sexual differences in feeding. It was found that under lack of tidal fluctuations, U. annulipes feeding is influenced by diel rhythms. In summer, males displayed a bimodal pattern of feeding, becoming more active in the morning and late afternoon with a gut evacuation rate of 0.795 h(-1), whereas females remained generally inactive and displayed short bouts of feeding during the day with a gut evacuation rate of 0.322 h(-1).

As a migratory crab, parent Eriocheir sinensis need to migrate to estuary (brackish water) for reproduction, and megalopas need to migrate to freshwater for development. Yangtze River estuary is located at the junction of the Yangtze River and the East China Sea, and the salinity of different regions varies greatly (salinity 0-30 parts per thousand). Therefore, salinity is one of the key environmental factors affecting E. sinensis. In this study, the salinity preference of parent and megalopas E. sinensis was observed and analyzed by the six-chambered and seven-chambered devices of laboratory experiments. Two groups of alternative salinity were set for parent crabs (7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 parts per thousand) and megalopas (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 parts per thousand). The results indicated that males showed no obvious preference for salinity, while females had obvious preference for different salinity and stronger dependence and tolerance to saltwater. Megalopas showed a significant preference for low salinity which was beneficial to migrating to freshwater quickly. It was speculated that the behavior of megalopas tending to freshwater was an inherited behavior in the evolutionary process rather than influenced by environment. The salinity preference of E. sinensis might change the position of spawning grounds and migratory routes, and then the annual fluctuation of salinity in Yangtze River estuary will affect the change of E. sinensis resources.",,,,,"Huang, Xiaorong/GVU-4903-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0944-1344,1614-7499,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11356-022-22850-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-22850-y,,SEP 2022,,,,,,36083372,,,,,WOS:000852118200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we assessed the natural variability of pH in coastal waters off Goa, eastern Arabian Sea. pH(T)showed large variability (7.6-8.1) with low pH conditions during south-west monsoon (SWM), and the variability is found to be associated with upwelling rather than freshwater runoff. Considering that marine biota inhabiting dynamic coastal waters off Goa are exposed to such wide range of natural fluctuations of pH, an acidification experiment was carried out. We studied the impact of low pH on the local population of sea urchinStomopneustes variolaris(Lamarck, 1816). Sea urchins were exposed for 210 days to three treatments of pH(T): 7.96, 7.76 and 7.46.

Under low pH conditions (pH(T)7.46), the elemental composition of sea urchin spines exhibited deposition of excess Sr(2+)as compared to Mg(2+)ions.

Results showed that net photosynthetic rate (P (N)), stomatal conductance, and intrinsic water-use efficiency of both plant species were negatively affected under CF and PF compared with the corresponding controls. The P (N) of both species under PF was comparable to that under CF. At the end of the experiment, the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration was not statistically different between water treatments, while that of P. elliottii was significantly higher than that of P. stenoptera. Although P. stenoptera formed lenticels under flooding conditions, P. elliottii seedlings allocated more mass to leaves and increased the relative growth rate of height to enhance the photosynthetic efficiency. Our results illustrated that P. stenoptera and P. elliottii seedlings developed different adaptive strategies in response to flooding, both CF and PF.

Cannibalism between cohorts may be a source of mortality limiting recruitment success in the wild, but the degree of inter-cohort cannibalism is unknown for early benthic phase blue king crabs. In laboratory experiments, we evaluated the effects of habitat type (sand and shell) on the predator functional response and foraging behavior of year-1 blue king crabs as predators of year-0 conspecifics and examined the effects of predator presence on crypsis of prey crabs. In sand, consumption rates increased with predator size and prey density until satiation, while predation rates in shell were low regardless of predator size or prey density. These differential predation rates yielded a type III functional response in sand but a type I functional response in shell habitat. Crypsis of prey crabs was generally high and did not change in the presence of predators. Predator foraging activity was reduced in shell and may be an adaptive behavior to balance foraging efficiency and susceptibility to larger predators. Our results demonstrate that early benthic phase blue king crabs are cannibalistic between cohorts in the laboratory and that shell material is extremely effective for reducing encounter rates with conspecific predators. The distribution and abundance of such habitat may be important for recruitment success in some populations. Future studies should compare benthic habitat and species assemblages in areas with variable abundances, such as the Pribilof Islands and Saint Matthew Island in the eastern Bering Sea, to better understand possible mechanisms for recruitment variability.",,,,,"Long, William C/C-7074-2009","Long, William C/0000-0002-7095-1245",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,FEB 18,2014,9,2,,,,,,,e88694,10.1371/journal.pone.0088694,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0088694,,,,,,,,24558414,,,,,WOS:000331706700060,View Full Record in Web of Science

Much of our understanding of these relationships is based on experiments with static OA treatments, although evidence suggests that the magnitude of diurnal fluctuations in carbonate chemistry may modulate the calcification response to OA. These light-mediated swings in seawater pH are projected to become more extreme with OA, yet their impact on bioerosion remains unknown. We evaluated the influence of diurnal carbonate chemistry variability on the bioerosion rates of two Caribbean sponges: the zooxanthellate Cliona varians and azooxanthellate Cliothosa delitrix. Replicate fragments from multiple colonies of each species were exposed to four precisely controlled pH treatments: contemporary static (8.05 +/- 0.00; mean pH +/- diurnal pH oscillation), contemporary variable (8.05 +/- 0.10), future OA static (7.80 +/- 0.00), and future OA variable (7.80 +/- 0.10). Significantly enhanced bioerosion rates, determined using buoyant weight measurements, were observed under more variable conditions in both the contemporary and future OA scenarios for C. varians, whereas the same effect was only apparent under contemporary pH conditions for C. delitrix. These results indicate that variable carbonate chemistry has a stimulating influence on sponge bioerosion, and we hypothesize that bioerosion rates evolve non-linearly as a function of pCO(2) resulting in different magnitudes and directions of rate enhancement/reduction between day and night, even with an equal fluctuation around the mean. This response appeared to be intensified by photosymbionts, evident by the consistently higher percent increase in bioerosion rates for photosynthetic C. varians across all treatments. These findings further suggest that more variable natural ecosystems may presently experience elevated sponge bioerosion rates and that the heightened impact of OA enhanced bioerosion on reef habitat could occur sooner than prior predictions.",,,,,"Manzello, Derek/A-8661-2014","Manzello, Derek/0000-0002-0720-3041; Morris, John/0000-0001-7734-8492",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/gcb.16442,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16442,,OCT 2022,,,,,,36129389,,,,,WOS:000862738600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this purpose, we examined the fatty acid (FA) composition of body phosphatidylcholine (PC), the body PL content and the PL class profile in carp fed from first-feeding up to 28 days semi-purified diets containing different PL classes, Larvae kept for 1 to 7 days without food were analyzed for comparison. The FA distribution in the larval body PC between saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated FA (SAFA/ MUFA /PUFA) varied according to larval size and diet, being approximately 40/30/30 in unfed larvae and 33-35/38-44/22-28 in fish after 28 days of feeding. The greatest modification concerned the relative importance of n - 3 and n - 6 FA, with n - 3/n - 6 ratios changing from approximately eight in the start-feeding larvae to 0.04-0.11 in the final fed larvae, in accordance with the low dietary n - 3/n - 6 ratios (0.02-0.08). The total PL content (% dry matter) of the fed larvae fluctuated around 7%, irrespective of fish size or diet. Expressed as a percentage of total FL, PC increased and phosphatidylserine (PS) decreased during growth, whereas phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidic acid (PA) remained constant. No significant effect of the PL class composition of the diet on that of the fish was found. The fixed PL class composition of the larvae, of a given size, implies the synthesis of the PL classes which are not provided by the diet. It is suggested that this synthesis is a limiting factor for the development of early larvae fed PL-deficient diets. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Early termination (pasture terminated 6 months before sowing) followed by winter (ETw) and spring (ETs) crops and late termination (pasture terminated 1 month before sowing) followed by a winter crop (LTw) were compared with continuous, mown pasture (MP). Emissions of N2O were measured with an automated gas sampling and analysing system. Emissions from MP were the lowest throughout the study, resulting in annual losses of 0.13 kg N2O-N ha(-1) in the first and the second years of the experiment. N2O-N loss was 0.6 kg ha(-1) from treatments without fallow in both years (LTw in 2013 and ETs in 2014). In the first year, annual losses from previous fallow in ETw and ETs plots were 7.1 and 3.6 kg N2O-N ha(-1), respectively. Higher annual N2O losses from treatments with fallow periods continued in the second year of the study and were 2.0 and 1.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) from ETw and LTw treatments, respectively. High emissions were associated with N mineralisation and the accumulation of NO3-N in the soil during the extensive fallow period after early pasture termination or wheat harvest. Soil water content was a key factor influencing the temporal fluctuations in N2O emissions. Low emissions occurred when water-filled pore space was <30%, whereas high emissions occurred when it was >65%, suggesting that denitrification was the major source of N2O emission. Crop grain yield was not affected by the duration of fallow (and therefore timing of pasture termination) in the first year, but was lower (P < 0.05) in the treatment without fallow in the second year. Terminating pasture late rather than early, thus reducing the length of the fallow period, is a practical way of reducing N2O emissions from mixed pasture-cropping systems.",,,,,,"Belyaeva, Oxana/0000-0002-8988-2737",,,,,,,,,,,,,1838-675X,1838-6768,,,,,2016,54,5,,,SI,,585,597,,10.1071/SR15307,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR15307,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000382564300013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Maximum nitrogen uptake rates are assumed to decline with shoot dry weight, to allow for the effects of plant age. The model was parameterized using data from the literature, and calibrated for differences in light intensity using an optimization algorithm utilizing data from three experiments in different growing seasons. The calibrated model was validated against the data from two independent experiments conducted under different light conditions. Results showed that the model made good predictions of nitrogen uptake by plants from seedlings to maturity under fluctuating light levels in a glasshouse.

While the details of the salt flux divergences and the salt fluxes vary throughout the bay, each is fully three dimensional. On experimental duration (three month) average, the total (horizontal plus vertical) advective salt flux divergence is mainly balanced by the vertical diffusive salt flux divergence, except near the bottom of the deep shipping channel, where horizontal diffusive salt flux divergence is also important Instantaneously, the local rate of change of salinity is primarily controlled by the advective salt flux divergence, with a secondary contribution by the vertical diffusive salt flux divergence everywhere and the horizontal diffusive salt flux divergence near the channel bottom. To examine the role of tidal pumping, the advective salt fluxes and divergences are further decomposed into the products of the mean salinity and velocity, and the correlation between the salinity and velocity fluctuations. The horizontal and vertical advective salt flux divergences by the mean quantities are equally large and counterbalancing (by continuity), with their sum being a small, but significant residual. The horizontal and vertical advective salt flux divergences due to tidal pumping are relatively small (when compared with the mean quantities) and counterbalancing; but, when summed their residual is comparable in magnitude to that by the mean quantities. So whereas the salt fluxes by tidal pumping are of secondary importance to the salt fluxes by the mean quantities, their total flux divergences are of comparable importance. The salt lux components in all three dimensions (axial, transverse and vertical) themselves vary along the Tampa Bay axis, and these findings may be typical of coastal plain estuaries given their geometrical complexities. Being that the distribution of salt flux bears upon the flux distributions of other scalars (e.g., nutrients, fish larvae, etc.) our findings for salt flux also have broader ecological implications.

We investigated the persistence and the physiological states of soil-inoculated Pseudomonas protegens (previously Pseudomonas fluorescens) CHAO (10(8) CFU g(-1) surface soil) in different soil microbial habitats in a planted ley (Medicago sativa L.) and an uncovered field plot. At 72 days, colony counts of the inoculant were low in surface soil (uncovered plot) and earthworm guts (ley plot), whereas soil above the plow pan (uncovered plot), and the rhizosphere and worm burrows present until 1.2 m depth (ley plot) were survival hot spots (10(5)-10(6) CFU g(-1), soil). Interestingly, strain CHAO was also detected in the subsoil of both plots, at 10(2)-10(5) CFU g(-1) soil between 1.8 and 2 m depth. However, non-cultured CHAO cells were also evidenced based on immunofluorescence microscopy. Kogure's direct viable counts of nutrient-responsive cells showed that many more CHAO cells were in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) or a non-responsive (dormant) state than in a culturable state, and the proportion of cells in those non-cultured states depended on soil microbial habitat. At the most, cells in a VBNC state amounted to 34% (above the plow pan) and those in a dormant state to 89% (in bulk soil between 0.6 and 2 m) of all CHAO cells. The results indicate that field-released Pseudomonas inoculants may persist at high cell numbers, even in deeper soil layers, and display a combination of different physiological states whose prevalence fluctuates according to soil microbial habitats.

In order to improve production efficiency, field experiments were conducted at Shiyanghe Experimental Station, China Agricultural University, Wuwei, Gansu Province, China using plastic mulch and drip irrigation to study the influence of two typical plastic mulches (transparent and black) and three wetted soil percentages on potato root distribution, evapotranspiration, tuber yield and quality, and water use efficiency (WUE) in 2014 and 2015. Using a wetted soil percentage of 55%, three soil surface treatments were tested: transparent plastic mulch, black plastic mulch, and a non-mulched check. With the transparent plastic mulch, three wetted soil percentages 35%, 55%, and 75% were evaluated. The soil retained moisture better in the mulched treatments than in the non-mulched treatment. As the plant canopy increased, the differences diminished. Potato grown without plastic mulch developed more roots than potato grown with mulch. The soil water fluctuations in the top of the bed with black plastic mulch were greater than with transparent plastic mulch. Potato grown with either plastic mulch had greater yield and WUE than potato grown without plastic mulch. Potato grown with transparent plastic mulch had 10% and 7% greater WUE in 2014 and 2015, respectively than potato grown with black plastic mulch but the differences were not statistically significant. For different wetted soil percentages, the irrigation frequency was higher with the 35% wetted soil treatment than with 55% or 75%. The irrigation at 35% principally only affected the soil water in the upper soil in contrast to the 55% or 75% treatments. The 35% wetted soil treatment had more root development in 2015. Potato evapotranspiration increased as the wetted soil percentage increased. The 75% wetted soil treatment had significantly more evapotranspiration than the 35% wetted soil treatment in 2015. The 35% wetted soil treatment had the highest WUE, 17% and 25% higher than the 75% wetted soil treatment in 2014 and 2015, respectively.

We explored the implications of the observed variation in productivity and stress for projected population dynamics based on a previously demonstrated corticosterone-survival relationship. Although productivity was highly variable (0 to 0.9 fledglings nest(-1)), the relationships between productivity and environmental indices were weak, with local SST providing slightly more explanatory power than PDO or ICI, suggesting that local factors rather than large-scale climate variability may determine variation in productivity. The relationships between stress and environmental indices were stronger than the relationship between productivity and environment. The measured response of stress to environment showed opposite signs between the southern and northern colonies, and typically implied annual mortality rates varying from 11 to 17%. The observed relationships between climate and stress indicate that anticipated warming might bring at least short-term demographic benefits for kittiwakes in the Bering shelf region, while having negative impacts on birds breeding in the Gulf of Alaska and western Aleutians. We predict decline (without immigration) for colonies with the lowest productivity and conclude that climate variability is likely to affect survival of North Pacific kittiwakes on a region-specific basis.

Individuals in waters with a salinity of 25.7 also displayed the greatest condition index of all locations (12.1 mg/cm(3), P < 0.05). Mussels from five of six locations displayed similar oxygen consumption rates (P <= 0.83) when standardized to weight (range, 0.78-0.88 mg O-2/g/h. Of the salinities noted in the experiment, 25.7 appears to be the optimal salinity in terms of growth and condition, whereas strongly fluctuating salinity obviously involves reduced growth. At first glance, this study may appear to be just one among numerous attempts to describe the effect of salinity on growth and respiration in Mytilus edulis and its Baltic hybrids. However, the majority of studies focus on field transplants and responses to salinity alterations in the laboratory, whereas only sparse information exists on locally adapted blue mussels in relation to their ambient, native salinity.",,,,,"Vismann, Bent/L-2731-2014","Vismann, Bent/0000-0002-3613-6511; Petersen, Jens Kjerulf/0000-0002-6412-7022",,,,,,,,,,,,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,,,AUG,2015,34,2,,,,,373,382,,10.2983/035.034.0220,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.034.0220,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000360410500020,View Full Record in Web of Science

For conventional maize cultivation in this region, the total dose of nitrogen fertilizer is usually broadcast early in the season to avoid the accessibility difficulties to the field late in the season. Drip fertigation allows the application of fertilizers throughout the season. Field experiments were conducted in a sub-humid region of Northeast China to investigate the influence of the number of fertigation events and the nitrogen applied on the nitrate content in the soil, plant growth, nitrogen uptake, and grain yield during the maize growing seasons in 2011, 2012, and 2013. The experiments used a single early-season fertigation and three in-season split fertigation events. For each fertigation treatment, four nitrogen levels of 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha(-1) were tested using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates. The results indicated that, for a given amount of nitrogen applied, the split fertigation treatments increased the nitrate content in the root zone during the late growing season, reducing the fluctuation of nitrate content in soil during the growing season. An increasing number of fertigation events and amount of nitrogen applied resulted in an increased aboveground plant biomass and nitrogen uptake of maize during the physiological maturity stage. Furthermore, the split in-season fertigation produced a significantly higher yield (approximately 5% at a significance level of p < 0.05) than a single early-season fertigation. Higher amounts of nitrogen applied produced higher maize yields for either the single fertigation treatments or the split fertigation treatments during the three experimental years. However, the difference between the nitrogen rates of 150 and 200 kg ha(-1) was not statistically significant We recommend a management practice of 150 to 200 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen applied in three in-season fertigation events to obtain high production while reducing the risk of nitrogen leaching.",,,,,"Li, Jiusheng/AAE-7859-2019","Li, Jiusheng/0000-0001-5482-0977",,,,,,,,,,,,,0883-8542,1943-7838,,,,,2015,31,1,,,,,103,117,,10.13031/aea.31.10773,http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.31.10773,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000350844000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The amplitude of these cycles, and the severity and duration of hypoxia and hypercapnia that result, can be increased by eutrophication, and are predicted to worsen with climate change. We conducted laboratory experiments to test the effects of both diel-cycling and constant low DO and pH (elevated pCO(2)) on growth of the juvenile eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), an economically and ecologically important estuarine species. Severe diel-cycling hypoxia (to 0.5 mg O-2 L-1) reduced shell growth in juvenile oysters, as did constant hypoxia (1.2 and 2.0 mg O-2 L-1), although effects varied among experiments, oyster ages, and exposure durations. Dielcycling pH reduced growth only in experiments in which calcite saturation state cycled to <= 0.10 and only during the initial weeks of these experiments. In other cases, cycling pH sometimes led to increased growth rates. Comparisons of treatment effects across multiple weeks of exposure, and during a longer post-experiment field deployment, indicated that juvenile oysters can acclimate to, and in some cases compensate for initial reductions in growth. As a result, some ecosystem services dependent on juvenile oyster growth rates may be preserved even under severe cycling hypoxia and pH.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,AUG 22,2016,11,8,,,,,,,e0161088,10.1371/journal.pone.0161088,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0161088,,,,,,,,27548256,,,,,WOS:000381768400029,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examined the effect of fatty acids on the growth (wet weight) of cultured mussels during 2000 and 2001 in Notre Dame Bay, Newfoundland. Mussels were socked in June 2000 and harvested in October 2001. On a monthly basis, the mussels grew at. variable rates (mean 10.73 +/- 6.86, range 5.9-18.8 mg d(-1) in 2000 and 10.09 +/- 8.91, range 5.1-22.9 mg d(-1) in 2001) with the highest growth rate in September of each year. The growth, however, did not demonstrate localized differences. The proportion of polar lipid (PrL) as a percent of total lipid was much higher in mussel samples (mean 71.1 +/- 4.8%) than the phytoplankton (mean 44.3 +/- 21.2%), and the opposite was observed for the neutral lipid (NL: mean 30.2 +/- 4.4% in mussels and 45.3 +/- 11.7% phytoplankton). The fatty acid profiles of phytoplankton and mussels were, in general the same, except that the pentaenoic fatty acid, 18:5 omega 3, was not detected in mussels, and no C-22 non-methylene interrupted dienes (NMIDs) were detected in phytoplankton. However, proportions of 22:2NMIDs (as percent of total identified fatty acids) in mussels were relatively high (range 2.5-3.5%) particularly in 2000. The 22:6 omega 3, 20:5 omega 3, 16:0, 14:0, 16:1 omega 7 and to some extent 16:4 omega 3 were the most abundant fatty acids in the phytoplankton and mussel samples. Of these fatty acids, 20:5 omega 3 was the only fatty acid in both phytoplankton and mussels that showed a significant positive correlation with growth, while correlations with other fatty acids varied in magnitude or direction (positive or negative) depending on the source of the acid being either phytoplankton or mussel. An interesting observation within the essential fatty acids was that neither 22:6 omega 3 nor 20:4 omega 6 was significantly correlated with growth, but when their levels were combined with 20:5 omega 3 to give the total essential fatty acid in phytoplankton or mussels, the result was a significant positive correlation with growth for both phytoplankton and mussel essential fatty acids. Moreover, the coefficients of correlation for the other physiologically important acids in bivalves, namely the 20:2NMIDs were by far the most significant ones, but only with the mussel NMID, and their correlation with growth was negative. Approximately 140 variables from mussels and phytoplankton were tested in order to construct a model to predict the growth of mussels. Of these variables, four were found to be significant (r(2)=0.725): 20:2NMID(1), 18:2 omega 4 and 22:5 omega 6 in mussels and 16:1 omega 9 in phytoplankton. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Buildings are usually considered as obstacles to the wind. A time-dependent simulation model has been applied for the prediction of the turbulent airflow around obstacles with arched and pitched roof geometry, under wind tunnel conditions. The numerical model is based on the direct solution of transient Navier-Stokes and continuity equations using the Galerkin Finite element method. To verify the reliability of the model an experiment was conducted inside a wind tunnel and the air velocity and turbulent kinetic energy profiles were measured around two small-scale obstacles with an arched-type and a pitched-type roof, respectively. The velocity components and the turbulent kinetic energy values were used to demonstrate a dynamic and statistical analysis of this complex flow. The wind tunnel tests presented good agreement with the numerical simulations with respect to airflow patterns. The different roof geometry of obstacles affected the instantaneous and time-mean averaged parameters of the flow. According to the instantaneous results of the numerical solution, airflow patterns presented fluctuating characteristics mainly downstream of the obstacles. Intense variations were shown in streamlines and velocity components, both at the arched-type and the pitched-type obstacle, starting from the upstream corner of the roof and the top of the roof respectively. The time-dependent simulation of the flow parameters can provide important information on instantaneous fluctuations of the complex flow phenomena around arched-type and pitched-type roof obstacles which cannot be obtained by the time-mean averaged approach.

A randomized experimental design was used with the treatment combination CO2 x soil N, replicated twice. Gas exchange measurements showed that photosynthetic capacity was significantly decreased in plants exposed to elevated CO2 and grown under nitrogen deficiency. Photosynthetic acclimation was, in this case, due to the occurrence of reduced rates of rubP saturated and rubP regeneration limited photosynthesis. Gas exchange measurements did not instead reveal any significant effect of elevated CO2 on the photosynthetic capacity of leaves of plants well fertilized with nitrogen, in spite of a transitory negative effect on rubP regeneration limited photosynthesis that was detected to occur in the central part of a day with high irradiance.

Though this dynamic behavior has been previously incorporated into soil carbon respiration modeling frameworks, a direct comparison between this active-dormant transition mechanism and a more simplified first-order model has yet to be made. Here, we demonstrate the necessary extent of model complexity needed to reproduce transient carbon respiration rates obtained from a set of soil incubation experiments implemented over a range of soil depths and time intervals. Two approaches are tested, one uses simplified first-order kinetics, whereas the other employs a transition between active and dormant biomass. The performance of each model is evaluated using an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) based on the accuracy with which they reproduce an experimental dataset consisting of two sets of time series soil incubations collected across a range of time and depth resolutions. Based on the AIC evaluation and model-data comparison, we conclude that a dormancy-enabled model featuring two distinct microbial strategists performs best for the majority of the soil profile (above 108 cm) for both high and low depth resolution and sampling frequency, despite the added parameters required. In contrast, the first-order model achieves better AIC scores when simulating our deepest soils (112-165 cm), where moisture fluctuations are expected to be less prevalent.

Natural populations of this species in Muroran, Hokkaido, Japan are most of the time immersed in the subtidal zone; however, those at the uppermost part of the sublittoral are sometimes emersed during low tide. In the laboratory experiment, the alga under aerial exposure up to 8 h under dim light at 20 degrees C and 50% humidity showed that the effective quantum yields (Delta F/F-m ') of Photosystem II quickly declined after more than 45 min of emersion; Delta F/F-m ' also failed to recover to the initial level even after 1 day of rehydration in seawater. Under emersion, the Delta F/F-m ' values were relatively stable and above 0.5 when the absolute water content (AWC, %) was greater than 50%; however, it declined as the AWC decreased. Once the algae were dehydrated to an AWC of less than 50%, their Delta F/F-m ' did not return to the initial level despite subsequent reimmersion in seawater, suggesting the low ability of photosynthetic recovery from dehydration. Results of in situ measurements in Muroran showed that the Delta F/F-m ' of S. japonica declined during the tidal exposure; however, it recovered after they were again immersed in seawater due to the rising tide. Furthermore, S. japonica showed a stenohaline photosynthetic response between 20 and 40 psu, as their Delta F/F-m ' values were found to be unchanged in these salinities after 5 days of laboratory culture; this suggests the seaweed's photosynthetic tolerance and/or acclimation within such a relatively narrow range, which might be one of the traits that preclude its occurrence in the intertidal and brackish waters.

Many of these themes relate to the potential of AOX to provide metabolic homeostasis in response to fluctuating cellular conditions, such as is often seen during stress. We then review reverse genetic experiments that have been used to test these hypotheses. To date, such experiments have been limited to just two dicot species and have only targeted one member (a stress-induced member) of the AOX multigene family. Nonetheless, the experiments to date strongly reinforce the idea that AOX respiration is of particular importance during abiotic and biotic stress. Finally, we propose that another core role of AOX may be to modulate the strength of a stress-signaling pathway from the mitochondrion that controls cellular responses to stress. In this way, AOX could be acting to provide a degree of signaling homeostasis from the mitochondrion. This hypothesis may provide explanation for some of the disparate results seen in reverse genetic experiments regarding the impact of AOX on the reactive oxygen network and oxidative damage.",,,,,,"Cvetkovska, Marina/0000-0002-7080-8203",,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-9317,1399-3054,,,,DEC,2009,137,4,,,,,392,406,,10.1111/j.1399-3054.2009.01254.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2009.01254.x,,,,,,,,19549065,,,,,WOS:000271975700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

When IAS spread across extensive geographic ranges, climatic variation may represent a source of strong natural selection through overwinter mortality and summer heat stress. This could favour local adaptation, i.e., evolutionary divergence of certain traits. IAS, however, are likely to show plasticity in survival-related traits, and environmental fluctuation in their new distribution range could favour the maintenance of this pre-existing phenotypic plasticity. By contrast, sexually selected traits are more likely to undergo evolutionary divergence when components of sexual selection differ geographically. Here, using data from a common-garden rearing experiment of Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis Baird and Girard, 1853) from five populations across the species' invasive range in China, we show that invasive mosquitofish have retained plasticity in key physiological (thermal tolerances), morphological and life-history traits even 100 years after their introduction to China, but exhibit heritable population differences in several sexually selected traits, including the shape of the male copulatory organ. Adaptive plasticity of traits linked to immediate survival in different thermal environments-while likely responsible for the species' extraordinary invasion success-could slow down genetic evolution. Several sexually selected traits could diverge geographically and show rapid evolutionary change, e.g., because climate alters selective landscapes arising from mate competition as an indirect consequence of variation in overwinter mortality.",,,,,"Riesch, Rüdiger/A-5787-2008","Riesch, Rüdiger/0000-0002-6769-8808; Zhou, Linjun/0000-0002-8916-5834; Riesch, Rudiger/0000-0002-0223-1254",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,MAR 10,2022,811,,,,,,,,152386,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152386,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152386,,DEC 2021,,,,,,34915006,,,,,WOS:000740221500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Flushing RAS with make-up water containing low alkalinity washes out valuable base added to the RAS (as bicarbonate, hydroxide, or carbonate), which increases farm operating costs when high alkalinity concentrations are maintained; however, alkalinity must not be so low that it interferes with nitrification or pH stability. For these reasons, a study was designed to evaluate the effects of alkalinity on biofilter performance, and CO2 stripping during cascade aeration, within two replicate semi-commercial scale Atlantic salmon smolt RAS operated with moving bed biological filters. Alkalinity treatments of nominal 10, 70, and 200 mg/L as CaCO3 were maintained using a pH controller and chemical dosing pumps supplying sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Each of the three treatments was replicated three times in each RAS. Both RAS were operated at each treatment level for 2 weeks; water quality sampling was conducted at the end of the second week. A constant feeding of 23 kg/day/RAS was provided every 1-2 h, and continuous lighting, which minimized diurnal fluctuations in water quality. RAS hydraulic retention time and water temperature were 4.3 days and 12.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C, respectively, typical of smolt production RAS in Norway. It was found that a low nominal alkalinity (10 mg/L as CaCO3) led to a significantly higher steady-state TAN concentration, compared to when 70 or 200 mg/L alkalinity was used. The mean areal nitrification rate was higher at the lowest alkalinity; however, the mean TAN removal efficiency across the MBBR was not significantly affected by alkalinity treatment. The CO2 stripping efficiency showed only a tendency towards higher efficiency at the lowest alkalinity. In contrast, the relative fraction of total inorganic carbon that was removed from the RAS during CO2 stripping was much higher at a low alkalinity (10 mg/L) compared to the higher alkalinities (70 and 200 mg/L as CaCO3). Despite this, when calculating the total loss of inorganic carbon from RAS, it was found that the daily loss was about equal at 10, and 70 mg/L, whereas it was highest at 200 mg/L alkalinity. pH recordings demonstrated that the 10 mg/L alkalinity treatment resulted in the lowest system pH, the largest increase in [H+] across the fish culture tanks, as well as giving little response time in case of alkalinity dosing malfunction. Rapid pH changes under the relatively acidic conditions at 10 mg/L alkalinity may ultimately create fish health issues due to e.g. CO2 or if aluminium or other metals are present. In conclusion, Atlantic salmon smolt producers using soft water make-up sources should aim for 70 mg/L alkalinity considering the relatively low loss of inorganic carbon compared to 200 mg/L alkalinity, and the increased pH stability as well as reduced TAN concentration, compared to lower alkalinity concentrations.

We report the first results of our experimental breeding program using mass selection focused on survival and resistance to OsHV-1 after four generations of selection for two lines. These lines originated from two stocks of adult wild oysters sampled from the Marennes-Oleron Bay in 2008. Each line was spawned in February 2009 to produce the base populations. Both lines were then either protected from OsHV-1 or tested in the field in 2009 where they were exposed to OsHV-1. For each line during 2010 to 2013, one generation per year was produced using either the survivors of the previous generation for the selected group or the oysters protected from OsHV-1 for the control group. After one generation of selection (G(1)) for both lines, the mean survival of the selected group was 34.5% compared with 12.3% in the control group. For the fourth generation of selection (G(4)), the survival of the selected group reached 69.0% and the survival of the control group was 7.3%. The gain in survival of the selected C. gigas spat over the control increased by 22.2%, 43.9%, 50.2% and 61.8% for the G(1), G(2), G(3) and G(4) generations, respectively. Our study demonstrates that mass selection for survival and OsHV-1 resistance was successful after four generations of selection, thus indicating a significant genetic improvement for the selected trait. A genotype x size interaction was observed with 55.1% of survival in G(4) when selected spat were transferred at 1 g versus 89.9% of survival when they were transferred at 3 g. Our study is the first to provide some estimates of the realized heritability for disease resistance using a mass selection scheme in an oyster species with values ranging from 0.34 to 0.63 depending on the size of the oysters exposed to OsHV-1. Oysters selected for their higher resistance to OsHV-1 infection in G4 showed higher growth (58.4 mm - 19.4 g) than controls (51.4 mm - 15.2 g), and mass selection had significantly improved the yield for the selected oysters (13.3 kg) over the controls (1.2 kg). Mass selection could be easily implemented by a commercial hatchery that cannot afford family-based selection that requires the production of numerous families for the base population.

This region, which has been identified as a hotspot for climate change, is therefore expected to experience environmental impacts that are considerably greater than those in many other places around the world. These natural pressures interact with the increasing demographic and economic developments occurring heterogeneously in the coastal zone, making the Mediterranean even more sensitive. This review paper aims to provide a review of the state of current functioning and responses of Mediterranean marine biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems with respect to key natural and anthropogenic drivers and to consider the ecosystems' responses to likely changes in physical, chemical and socio-economical forcings induced by global change and by growing anthropogenic pressure at the regional scale. The current knowledge on and expected changes due to single forcing (hydrodynamics, solar radiation, temperature and acidification, chemical contaminants) and combined forcing (nutrient sources and stoichiometry, extreme events) affecting the biogeochemical fluxes and ecosystem functioning are explored. Expected changes in biodiversity resulting from the combined action of the different forcings are proposed. Finally, modeling capabilities and necessity for modeling are presented. A synthesis of our current knowledge of expected changes is proposed, highlighting relevant questions for the future of the Mediterranean ecosystems that are current research priorities for the scientific community. Finally, we discuss how these priorities can be approached by national and international multi-disciplinary research, which should be implemented on several levels, including observational studies and modeling at different temporal and spatial scales.

In this study, we explored the implications for juvenile scleractinians (<40-mm diameter) of growing on igneous versus carbonate rock on the shallow reefs (5-m depth) of St. John, US Virgin Islands. Surveys revealed that juvenile corals occurred at densities of 16 colonies m(-2) and were distributed on igneous and carbonate rocks in proportion to the abundance of these surfaces, suggesting that larvae do not discriminate between rock types at settlement. Repeated surveys demonstrated that all juvenile corals (i.e., pooled among taxa) grew 41% slower on igneous versus carbonate rock between January and August, but not between August and January when the growth was statistically indistinguishable between rock types. Although the growth of the most common juvenile coral, Porites astreoides, was similar on both substrata, the photophysiology of this species was affected by the type of rock. The maximum relative electron transfer rate (rETR, a proxy for photosynthesis) of P. astreoides was down-regulated 30% on igneous compared to carbonate rock. Phylogenetic analyses of the Symbiodinium community sequence profiles within P. astreoides revealed significant differences between substrata, with a greater diversity of co-occurring ITS-2 sequences in corals growing on carbonate compared to igneous rock. While substratum-dependent patterns in the characteristics of juvenile corals suggested there is selective value to the settlement choices made by larvae, these trends did not translate into differences in survival, at least over the time scale investigated. It remains uncertain what features of the rocks affected coral performance, but differences in the temperature of the rock may be an important feature during the warmest period of the year.

It is Turkey's seventh largest lake in terms of area and the third largest among salt lakes. Due to the nature of the lake water, a limited number of aquatic creatures live in this lake, and the lake also has international significance in terms of endemic bird species. The water level in Burdur Lake, which is very important in terms of the population, agriculture, animal husbandry, and endemic plant species in the region, has been dropping since 1971. The lake relies on rains, seasonal and continuous streams, and groundwater as sources. The dams built on streams feeding the lake are not sufficient as sources due to agricultural activities and wells around the lake. In this study, the changes in the lake area were determined with the geographic information systems program using the satellite images between 1984 and 2016. The area changes for the lake area from 2020 to 2040 were determined with the artificial neural network program, using the average temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation data from the Burdur meteorology station for the same years as input data and the changes in the lake area as output data. In present study, it was predicted that the lake will shrink to approximately 87.2 km(2) by 2040 if the current conditions continue. This shows that Burdur Lake, which is a salty lake, will be more saline, and this situation will affect the habitat negatively.

Although extreme low-tide, air exposure (hypoxia), high-irradiance and thermal stress are structuring forces of intertidal coral communities, some octocorals have developed the ability to withstand emersion. Here, we investigated, for the first time, the physiological mechanisms that enable an octocoral, Veretillum cynomorium, to tolerate the rapid cyclical fluctuations of the intertidal environment. A significant increase in expression of two molecular chaperones, heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), was observed throughout the emersion period, which was then followed by a drop during immersion. An opposite trend was observed for the peroxidase activity, as there was no malondialdehyde (MDA) build-up in coral tissues during air exposure. Thus, coral tissues were not subjected to any peroxidative damage during air exposure. Additionally, during the emersion phase, there was a significant increase in CAT and GST activities, whereas SOD activity remained stable. Altogether, our results suggest that HSC70/HSP70, CAT and GST constitute an integrated response during oxygen-restricted periods. In fact, this strategy may constitute an anticipatory protective response to the oxidative stress caused by the reoxygenation event. The present study constitutes the first evidence of cellular preparation to post-hypoxic free radical damage in octocorals, and we argue that such physiological strategy can allow these organisms to thrive in intertidal habitats and withstand air exposure during low tides.

The most efficient long term conservation method of this hybrid is through cryopreservation. Cryopreservation involving the vitrification method consists of explants exposure to highly concentrated cryoprotective solution followed by freezing rapidly in liquid nitrogen. However, these treatments involved highly concentrated cryoprotectant that could incur toxicity to the explants. Hence, cryopreservation protocol requires biochemical analyses in understanding the damages or injuries occurred during cryopreservation treatments. In this study, biochemical analyses revealed a general reduction in chlorophyll, carotenoid and porphyrin content to 0.40 mu g/g F W (thawing stage), 31.50 mu g/g F W unloading stage and 2230.41 mu g/g F W (thawing stage), respectively in comparison to the control treatments. In addition, increased level in proline content were obtained at different cryopreservation stages with highest level (5.42 mu mole/g F W) recorded at the PVS2 dehydration stage. Fluctuated outcomes were obtained in catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and peroxidase (POX) enzyme activities in PLBs exposed to different cryopreservation stages. Lowest values recorded for CAT enzyme activity were obtained at the dehydration stage (3.94 U/g). Lowest POX enzyme activities were obtained at the dehydration (122.36 U/g) and growth recovery (106.40 U/g) stages. Additionally, lowest APX enzyme activities values were recorded at the thawing (7.47 U/g) and unloading (7.28 U/g) stages.

The observed duration of high sea-level anomalies (SLAs) for the UHSL was successfully represented by assimilation results. Through sensitivity experiments, we investigated the contribution of two factors, the wind and the Kuroshio effects, as suggested by previous research. The northeasterly winds associated with Typhoon 7123 induced coastal-trapped waves (CTWs) along the Kashima-nada Sea. The CTWs propagated clockwise along the coast at a speed of about 2.3 m/s and caused the sea level to increase by about 15 cm in Sagami and Tokyo Bays. A cold eddy associated with a Kuroshio meander was formed, and as a result, the warm Kuroshio water intruded into the Enshu-nada Sea due to the northward flow in the eastern flank of the eddy. The warm water intrusion significantly contributed to the duration of SLAs of about 30 cm around the Enshu-nada and Kumano-nada Seas.

While the traditional plating method did not show significant differences among three brands or between before and after storage, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the brand factor significantly impacted the diversity and abundance of native bacterial populations. In order to evaluate the interaction between native bacteria and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ECO157), day-0 and day-15 salad homogenates were inoculated with ECO157 (a final concentration of 5.5 log CFU/ml). Inoculated samples were stored at 4 degrees C for additional 15 days and the behavior of inoculated ECO157 was monitored by plating samples on CHROMagar (TM) O157 agar on days 0, 5, 10 and 15. The top four phyla of bacteria present in all three brands of salad were Proteobacteria, Bacterioidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. Changes in the relative abundance and diversity of bacterial populations were significantly altered by inoculation of ECO157. The inoculation remarkably decreased the beta diversity (Jaccard distance) of the bacterial populations (P = 0.005). During the additional 15-day storage, culturable ECO157 cells decreased over the entire storage time. However, fluctuations of culturable ECO157 cells were observed on days 5 and 10. In day-0 brand A and day-15 brands A and C, culturable ECO157 cells were significantly higher on day 10 than on day 5. Microbiome analysis results showed that the relative abundance of Planomicrobium, Aeromonas, Carnobacterium, and Fusobacterium were negatively correlated with the decreasing numbers of culturable ECO157 cells from day 5 to day 10 after inoculation and the relative abundance of genera Methylotenera, Yersinia, Shewanella, Dyadobacter, and Brochothrix were positively correlated with the increasing numbers of culturable ECO157 cells from day 5 to day 10.

The applied model, PESTonFARM, is driven by the parameters derived directly from the behavior and biology of the target insect species, and spatiotemporal traits of the local terrain and climate. The model projections are actively generated by behavior of the primary causative actors of the invasion processes-individual virtual insects-members of the initial propagules or incipient populations. Algorithms of the model were adjusted to reflect behavior and ecology of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, used as a case-example in the presented study. The model was parametrized based on compiled published experimental information about C. capitata behavior and development, and validated using published data from dispersion and trapping studies. The model reliably simulated behavior, development and dispersion of individual members of an invasive cohort, and allowed to quantify pest establishment and detection chances in landscapes of varying spatiotemporal complexity, host availability and climates. The results support the common view that, under optimal conditions (farmland with continuous fruit availability and suitable climate), even a single propagule of medium size (100 females) usually results in pest establishment and detection within the first year post-invasion. The results demonstrate, however, that under specific sub-optimal conditions determined by the local climate, weather fluctuations and landscape topography (e.g., sub-urban), the incipient cryptic populations may occasionally continue for several generations, and remain undetected by typical pest surveillance grids for the periods extending beyond 2-years post-invasion.",,,,,"Lux, Slawomir A/G-1731-2012","Lux, Slawomir A/0000-0001-5978-1145",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-042X,,,,,JAN 9,2018,8,,,,,,,,1121,10.3389/fphys.2017.01121,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.01121,,,,,,,,29375396,,,,,WOS:000419590100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To cope with such constraints, these organisms must have well developed compensatory mechanisms involving antioxidant and energetic adjustments. The oyster Crassostrea gigas is regularly exposed to high oxygen fluctuations and is a good model to understand these physiological regulations. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms involved in response to short-term oxygen variations in the digestive gland and hemocytes of C. gigas. The effects of returning into water after an emersion period were tested for 24 h at two different oxygen concentrations (normoxic 8.8 mg O-2 L-1 and hypoxic 2.6 mg O-2 L-1). Gene expression on several antioxidant enzymes was performed. In addition, a marker of oxidative damage, the malondialdehyde (MDA) was quantified. Hemocyte parameters measured were viability, concentration of different cellular sub-populations and oxidative activity. Changes in energetic metabolism were investigated measuring mRNA levels of pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Moreover, mRNA levels of the transcription factor HIF alpha were analyzed. Higher levels of the alternative oxidase (AOX) mRNA in normoxic conditions corroborate the hypothesis of the AOX having a role in the redox balance. MDA levels did not show any condition effect, suggesting that hypoxic conditions did not cause oxidative stress. mRNA levels of antioxidant enzymes and hemocyte oxidative activity increased during the 24 h of immersion. This suggests that the disruption of tidal cycles by maintaining oysters immersed resulted in an increase of oxygen-dependent activities. No clear hypoxic responses were detected neither in a switch of PEPCK and PK toward anaerobic metabolism, nor in HIF alpha regulation. PK mRNA levels were significantly higher in nomoxic conditions, suggesting that more elevated oxygen concentrations would lead to higher energetic metabolism. Hemocyte concentrations were higher in hypoxic conditions suggesting an increased hematopoiesis. This study brings new insights in understanding how oysters, and more in general intertidal molluscs, cope with short-term oxygen variations. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Numerous dendrochronological (tree-ring) studies have identified climate factors that influence year-to-year variability in growth for given tree species and location. However, traditional dendrochronology methods have limitations that prevent them from adequately assessing stand-level (as opposed to species-level) growth. We argue that stand-level growth analyses provide a more meaningful assessment of forest response to climate fluctuations, as well as the management options that may be employed to sustain forest productivity. Working in a mature, mixed-species stand at the Howland Research Forest of central Maine, USA, we used two alternatives to traditional dendrochronological analyses by (1) selecting trees for coring using a stratified (by size and species), random sampling method that ensures a representative sample of the stand, and (2) converting ring widths to biomass increments, which once summed, produced a representation of stand-level growth, while maintaining species identities or canopy position if needed. We then tested the relative influence of seasonal climate variables on year-to-year variability in the biomass increment using generalized least squares regression, while accounting for temporal autocorrelation. Our results indicate that stand-level growth responded most strongly to previous summer and current spring climate variables, resulting from a combination of individualistic climate responses occurring at the species- and canopy-position level. Our climate models were better fit to stand-level biomass increment than to species-level or canopy-position summaries. The relative growth responses (i.e., percent change) predicted from the most influential climate variables indicate stand-level growth varies less from to year-to-year than species-level or canopy-position growth responses. By assessing stand-level growth response to climate, we provide an alternative perspective on climate-growth relationships of forests, improving our understanding of forest growth dynamics under a fluctuating climate.",,,,,"Weiskittel, Aaron/H-3688-2019; Hollinger, David Y/G-7185-2012","Weiskittel, Aaron/0000-0003-2534-4478; Teets, Aaron/0000-0003-1498-658X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,AUG,2018,24,8,,,,,3587,3602,,10.1111/gcb.14120,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14120,,,,,,,,29520931,,,,,WOS:000437284700027,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"KVITEK, T",,,,"KVITEK, T",,,THE REGULATED GROUNDWATER TABLE AND LOAD-CAPACITY OF SOIL OF GRASSLANDS,ROSTLINNA VYROBA,,,,,,,,,,,,"A field experimental investigation was performed at the site Velky Rybnik, the Pelhrimov district. The site is at an altitiude of 460 m above sea level; the climatic region is mild and warm, slightly moist, hilly B5, agricultural region of potato-rye subtype with a long-term sum of precipitation in the year R = 600 mm and during the growing season this was R(v) = 400 mm. Average air temperature T = 7-degrees-C, in the growing season this being T(v) = 13-degrees-C. After drainage performed in the years 1985 to 1986, the site was recultivated (except undrained area). In May 1988, a grassland was established in the green oats undersown (115 kg per 1 ha) in the composition as follows: white clover (4 kg), timothy grass (9 kg), meadow fescue (8 kg), red fescue (2 kg), smooth-stalked meadow grass (4 kg), meadow foxtail (6 kg). The total sowing rate was 33 kg per 1 ha. The site was drained by a systematic drainage consisted of polyvinyl chloride PVC pipes, a diameter of collecting drains was 63mm, that of leaky drains was 75 mm. A spacing of the drainage is 15 m and 0,9 m is a depth of collecting drains. The water supply to drainage segment is based on the gravitational principle, the water table regulation in manholes is dependent on sliding spilway pipe, adjustable to the required level. Damming of water is regulated always from a sinlge place of particular drainage group on the header. To evaluate the soil load capacity, physical properties of soil cover are important, especially those in surface soil horizons. In hydrological survey, an attention was paid to the evaluation of soil texture. The soil to the depth of 0.25 m can be classified as soft-textured sandy loam with grain-size grade I ranging from 23.25 to 26.08 %, the grain-size grade II is ranging from 29.88 to 36.28 %. In view of physical properties of the soil it was manifested that the porosity and reduced bulk density are influenced by tha amount of root mass in the surface layer, that is its mineralization in dependence on the water regime of the site. The porosity was about 61 to 62 % of bulk on drier soil, this being even 68 % vol. on waterlogged sites. This is accompanied also by a decrease in the reduced bulk density in moisture site to the value of 0.83 g per cm3. A maximum capillary capacity to the depth of 0.15 m was 57 % vol., this was 51 to 57% vol. to depth of 0.25 m. Specific weight ranged from 2.63 to 2.70 g per cm3. In view of hydraulic conductivity of the soil after drainage, the soil profile may be characterized by three layers. The first layer is sod, permeable for water in the range of 0.5 mm and day, and more. This layer is limited to the depth of the profile to 0.20 m. The second layer consists of loams at the depth of 0.2 to 0.8 m with markedly fluctuating sand addition in the profile. Hydraulic conductivity is sporadically 0.5 m per day, but also 0.116 to 0.011 m per day (measured on the Kopecky rollers). In this view it seems to be impermeable. The third layer to the depth of 0.8 m is composed of sands of permeability (measured JSM) ranging from 2.54 to 3.22 m per day. The permeability of the sod layer, being the result of the root system of the soil profile, brings many problems in terrain runoff-less depressions when rainfall water runs down the less permeable layer at the depth of 0.2 m to the depression places instead of slow and uniform infiltration through the whole soil profile (a prerequisition is almost the same permeability of the soil profile). In depression water stagnates and causes a marked stand degradation associated with a disorder of plot load capacity. Precipataion water causes a change in the mositrue of surface layers, though this did not change the reduced bulk density essentially when hydraulic pressure of water breaks capillary pores and the change in the ratio of capillary and gravitational pores appears, this leading to the disintegration of the soil texture. In groundwater table regulation (GWT), these problems occurred too, though not in dependence on the GWT. Extreme GWT values, however, had an impact on capillary water content in soil. The course of GWT on the regulated block is presented in Fig. 1. This gives the GWT values in the growing season and in relation to rainfall as well. GWT values were obtained by measurements on four corner plots of experimental blocks. It follows from Fig. 1 that there is an impact of water supply in the spring period on the level of GWT regulation. The effect of higher water levels was confirmed in the Jankovsky flow in relation to GWT of experimetal plots. The regulation of optimum levels of GWT can be gained only with problems in recent period. This fact is connected with drainage effect of the flow. GWT response to the draining function of the drainage was very good and on the contrary, GWT regulation made in June and July confirms also a good response time. The effect of the GWT regulation on the experimental block can be seen in Tab. II. The first period of the regulation shows that the differentiation of average GWT here is not practically high (the effect of spring water reverses). GWT is ranging from 0.31 to 0.,48 m under the terrain. The second period of the regulation already manifested that prerequisitions of GWT formation created at the end of the study can be obtained (Tab. III). Despite it, as can be seen from the maximum and minimum GWT values, GWT values are not stabilized. GWT formation is influenced by many factors (rainfall, the stroke of water table in river, drainage function of the flow, effect of springs in its regulation. In the period without regulation, that is only drainae function, identical GWT values can be obtained. In 1989 when GWT values were of extreme levels, the soil load capacity was measured by the Gotke probe collectin the soil moisture and with rollers to determine the physical properties of soil. The following blocks were studied: ecoblock E - non-recultivated, block with regulation A and C2. Tab. IV presents the quantities having a decisive role in the soil load capacity. It follows from this comparison a low, extreme value of reduced bulk density in the E block caused mainly by organic matter content in the surface layer of thc soil profile. Humification prevails over mineralization as an expression of extensive utilization of the plot and non-regulated water regime. The soil moisture in the time of measuring was very low, differed from regulated levels where this was on the level of 50 % vol. At the same time, a high soil moisture in regulated localities had no effect on the soil load capacity. as this was below the level of the maximum capillary capacity, being on the level of 56 to 57 % vol. In thc soil prevailed capillary water whose effect was not destructive on the change of plot load capacity. Thus, a decisive criterion is reduced bulk density and the presence of gravitational water in soil. Even at these high GWT values in the block A, C2, it can be said that the plot load capacity was good in all, satisfying to present mechanization of the pressure 300 to 400 kPa. The distribution of precipitation helped to this during the growing season when there was a deficit of precipitation extremes in July and August. Maximum precipitation sums for a month were 60 to 70 mm. In depression places, where the surface is not always even, the terrain load capacity is broken due to over-moistening of thc soil profile from upper parts, that is in the places even where is no GWT. It seems that the change in the soil resistance in permanent grasslands in dependence on the soil moisture and reduced bulk density is very complicated at a low reduced bulk density (below the value 0.9 g per cm3), the soil moisture is not decisive, but organic matter content in soil is well applied here. In this field a decrease of the soil resistance will be nonlinear with the decrease in the soil resistance caused by the soil moisture at sites with sufficient reduced bulk density.",,,,,"Kvítek, Tomáš/AAN-2531-2020; Kvitek, Tomas/J-2670-2016","Kvitek, Tomas/0000-0002-3698-0309",,,,,,,,,,,,,0370-663X,,,,,,1992,38,3-4,,,,,313,320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992HY57800015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lumbricids are suggested to have density-dependent regulation of species populations, but it is not known whether their effects on soil processes are density-dependent. In a field experiment, litter/soil microcosms contained monocultures of five common lumbricid species belonging to epigeic, anecic and endogeic ecological groups, at various density levels. After 6 and 15 weeks, respiration rates of soil systems were measured and (after subtraction of approximately calculated earthworm respiration) microbial respiration rates estimated. In the presence of earthworms, respiration of soil systems tended to increase. After 6 weeks, this increment was explained by earthworm's own respiration. However, after 15 weeks earthworm respiration comprised 12-80% of the respiration increment; hence, microbial respiration was stimulated by earthworm activities. In any earthworm species, total community and microbial respiration were correlated with its density increase. However, specific respiration increments (per unit earthworm biomass) were not significantly affected by lumbricid density. The lack of density-dependent patterns indicates a weak impact of lumbricid intraspecific interactions on soil respiration. However, specific respiration increments and stimulation of microbial respiration varied across earthworm species, being higher for endogeic than for epigeic/anecic species. This is explained by a relatively lower microbial grazing by endogeics and a depletion of litter (a resource and environment for the microbial community) by epigeic/anecic earthworms. Overall, the results support the view that microbial community adapts to the presence of earthworms by switching to a smaller, but a more active one.",,,,,"Uvarov, Alexei/AAE-5342-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1505-2249,,,,,,2016,64,4,,,,,534,546,,10.3161/15052249PJE2016.64.4.009,http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15052249PJE2016.64.4.009,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000392459500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we explore how the enhanced tropical Indian Ocean warming in recent decades favors stronger trade winds in the western Pacific via the atmosphere and hence is likely to have contributed to the La Nina-like state (with enhanced east-west Walker circulation) through the Pacific ocean-atmosphere interactions.

Seed heat tolerance is important, preventing seed mortality during fire passage, and is usually predicted by seed traits. This study investigated the role of fire frequency (ecological effects) and seed traits through phylogenetic comparison (historical effects), in determining post-fire germination and seed mortality in legume species of the Cerrado, a tropical savanna forest mosaic. Methods Seeds of 46 legume species were collected from three vegetation types (grassy savannas, woody savannas and forests) with different fire frequencies. Heat shock experiments (100 C for 1 min, 100 degrees C for 3 min, 200 C for 1 min) were then performed, followed by germination and seed viability tests. Principal component analysis, generalized linear mixed models and phylogenetic comparisons were used in data analyses. Key Results Heat shocks had little effect on germination, but seed mortality was variable across treatments and species. Seed mortality was lowest under the 100 degrees C 1 min treatment, and significantly higher under 100 degrees C 3 min and 200 degrees C 1 min; larger seed mass decreased seed mortality, especially at 200 C. Tree species in Detarioideae had the largest seeds and were unaffected by heat. Small seededspecies (mostly shrubs from grassy savannas) were relatively sensitive to the hottest treatment. Nevertheless, the presence of physical dormancy helped to avoid seed mortality in small-seeded species under the hottest treatment. Conclusions Physical dormancy-break is not tied to fire in the Cerrado mosaic. Heat tolerance appears in both forest and savanna species and is predicted by seed traits (seed mass and physical dormancy), which might have helped forest lineages to colonize the savannas. The results show seed fire responses are better explained by historical than ecological factors in the Cerrado, contrasting with different fire-prone ecosystems throughout the world.",,,,,"Fidelis, Alessandra/B-9769-2012; Pausas, Juli G/C-5794-2008","Fidelis, Alessandra/0000-0001-9545-2285; Pausas, Juli G/0000-0003-3533-5786; Daibes, L.

Understanding how different species in these environments mitigate stress associated with intermittent hypoxia through compensatory behaviors, such as aquatic surface respiration (ASR), is important in determining the effect of these stressors on estuarine ecosystems. Behavioral responses of Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia), striped killifish (Fundulus majalis), mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), and juvenile striped bass (Morone saxatilis) were independently observed during exposure to two levels of diel-cycling DO (3-9 mg O(2)l(-1) and 1-11 mg O(2)l(-1)) each tested with both the corresponding pH cycle (7.2-7.8 and 6.8-8.1, respectively) and static pH (7.5) under controlled laboratory conditions. In treatments in which DO declined to similar to 3 mg O(2)l(-1) none of the species examined exhibited ASR behavior either with or without the associated pH decline. However, ASR was observed during both 4-hour and extended 16-hour exposure where DO declined to similar to 1.0-1.6 mg O(2)l(-1) in M. menidia and both Fundulus species. M. saxatilis did not exhibit ASR and no mortalities occurred during 4-hour low DO/pH treatments or during 16 hour exposure to 1.5 mg O(2)l(-1). During extended 16-hour treatments, DO thresholds for ASR were not found to be different between F. majalis and F. heteroclitus, but both differed significantly from M. menidia. Across both 4-hour and 16 hour treatments, the onset of ASR was observed in M. menidia at or near lethal levels (1.31-1.62 mg O(2)l(-1)). No evidence of a pH (pCO2) effect on ASR or survival was found in any species in response to naturally co-varying DO and pH swings, despite pH as low as 6.8 and high pCO(2) levels of > similar to 12,000 mu atm. These results suggest that utilization of ASR is a species-specific response influenced by the magnitude and duration of hypoxic exposure. ASR may serve as a last-ditch strategy by M. menidia to prolong survival for minutes to hours, but function as a means for F. heteroclitus to mitigate or reduce negative effects of hypoxia on a scale of days to weeks, with F. majalis exhibiting an intermediate response.",,,,,,"Dixon, Rachel/0000-0002-0824-2771; Targett, Timothy/0000-0003-3497-2273",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,AUG,2017,493,,,,,,20,30,,10.1016/j.jembe.2017.04.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2017.04.001,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000403730400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

During the vegetative stage, tall indica landraces (Nona Bokra, Buhra Rata, Panwell, and Pokkali) appeared to be resistant throughout while in japonica varieties (I Kong Pao (IKP) and Tainung 67) and elite breeding lines (IR 4630, in 2153 and in IR 31785), resistance fluctuated. Panwell, which was the only indica variety evaluated during the reproductive stage, also expressed salt resistance during booting, heading and grain maturation while varieties with the greatest variability in salt stress response during the vegetative phase (IR 4630, in 31785 and IKP) also showed the greatest variability during reproductive development. Thus, varietal levels of resistance to salinity at different growth stages are not necessarily interdependent characteristics. Variability in salt resistance of different genotypes during the vegetative and reproductive phases of development was not correlated to their mean level of relative resistance. There was an ontogenic evolution of salt resistance and the young seedling stage appeared to be the most sensitive to NaCl during vegetative growth. Nevertheless, short- and middle term effects of stress have to be distinguished for each genotype since some varieties showed better growth during the second week of stress than during the first, whilst others showed an opposite trend. Moreover, even at specific stages of development, plant responses to NaCl were quite variable according to the criterion used to quantify salinity resistance. The identification of genotypes resistant to NaCl at specific developmental stages is essential to improve the understanding of the effects of salt stress upon phenology and to elaborate further breeding programmes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,,,,,DEC,1995,46,293,,,,,1843,1852,,10.1093/jxb/46.12.1843,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/46.12.1843,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995TQ69200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we show that this male-limited (ML) evolution treatment led to the evolution (in both sexes) of masculinized wing morphology, body size, growth rate, wing loading, and allometry. In addition to more male-like size and shape, ML evolution resulted in an increase in developmental stability for males. However, females expressing ML chromosomes were less developmentally stable, suggesting that being ontogenetically more male-like was disruptive to development.

Unlike uninfected cadavers, which were rapidly scavenged, those infected with the fungus persisted in the environment for a number of weeks. The environmental factor most associated with cadaver disappearance was rainfall. The high environmental humidity associated with rainfall was also required for sporulation of the fungus on host cadavers, although the likelihood of sporulation differed between microsites. Characteristics of the infection profile from infective cadavers were investigated by the sequential exposure of uninfected hosts to sporulating cadavers in field cages. This experiment revealed that cadavers remained infective for > 30 days, with the net infectivity changing through time. The most likely explanation for these changes is climatic influences on both the fungus and host. High humidity was not required for infection. A measurement of the transmission coefficient between healthy hosts and sporulating cadavers in the field was obtained at a realistic density of infectious cadavers. This revealed a figure of 0.45 m(2) day(-1). Overall, these experiments show that following host death, M. anisopliae var. acridum can be persistent in the environment, sporulate on host cadavers and reinfect new hosts at a realistically low field density, although at least in arid or semi-arid areas, rainfall may be critical to the horizontal transmission of this pathogen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,,,,,JUL,2001,100,1,,,,,69,76,,10.1046/j.1570-7458.2001.00849.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1570-7458.2001.00849.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000169739200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

In principle, these and similar models, if validated experimentally, could be used to predict dynamic germination from isothermal data. The procedures to generate both isothermal and dynamic germination curves have been automated and posted as freeware on the Internet in the form of interactive Wolfram demonstrations. A fully stochastic model of individual and small groups of spores, developed in parallel, shows that when the germination probability is constant from the start, the germination curve is nonsigmoid. It becomes sigmoid if the probability monotonically rises from zero. If the probability rate function rises and then falls, the germination reaches an asymptotic level determined by the peak's location and height.

Integrating this dynamic model into a multi-layer canopy model provided accurate predictions of photosynthetic acclimation of greenhouse cucumber canopies grown under high and low nitrogen supply in combination with day-to-day fluctuations in light at two different levels. This allowed us to quantify the degree of optimality in canopy nitrogen use for maximizing canopy carbon assimilation, which was influenced by N-ph distribution along canopy depth or N-ph partitioning between functional pools. Our analyses suggest that N-ph distribution is close to optimum and N-ph reallocation is more important under low nitrogen.

In this study, a method exclusively using multiple satellite observations is used to calculate sea-ice volume flux across the eastern boundary (EB) and northern boundary (NB) of the Laptev Sea during the October November and February March or March April periods (corresponding to the ICESat autumn and winter campaigns) between 2003 and 2008. Seasonally, the mean total ice volume flux (i.e., NB + EB) over the investigated autumn period (1.96 km(3)/day) is less than that over the winter period (2.57 km(3)/day). On the other hand, the large standard deviations of the total volume flux, 3.45 and 0.91 km(3)/day for the autumn and winter campaigns, indicate significant interannual fluctuations in the calculated quantities. A statistically significant (P > 0.99) positive correlation, R = 0.88 (or 0.81), is obtained between volume flux across the EB (or NB) and mean ice-drift speed over the boundary for the considered 11 ICESat campaigns. In addition, statistics show that a large fraction of the variability in volume flux across the NB over the 11 investigated campaigns, roughly 40%, is likely explained by ice thickness variability. On average, flux through the Laptev Sea amounts to approximately one-third of that across Fram Strait during the autumn and winter campaigns.

Experimental data, mostly obtained at high laboratory densities, suggest intense intraspecific competition for resources and/or living space and density-dependent dynamics in earthworm populations, irrespective of their ecological group affiliation. In the present study performed in large field microcosms, I investigated whether density-dependent responses occur within the earthworm density gradients more realistic for the natural sites. Five lumbricid species from epigeic (Dendrobaena octaedra, Lumbricus rubellus), endogeic (Allolobophora chlorotica, Aporrectodea caliginosa) and anecic (Lumbricus terrestris) ecological groups were tested. Soil systems populated with earthworm monocultures in large (20-L) microcosms were exposed in a beech-oak forest for 4.5 months; each species was represented by two (L. terrestris) or three treatments forming gradients of increasing density. In two endogeic species, manifold and generally similar density-dependent responses (a retardation of growth, maturation and reproduction rates, but higher mortality rates with density increase) were revealed, likely explained by spatial competition rather than by direct food competition. In each of epigeic species density-dependent responses were less variable and more species-specific. In contrast to endogeics, direct food competition was presumably a more important cause of density-dependence. In L. terrestris no significant density-dependent responses in adult earthworms were revealed; however, they need to be further investigated in relation to the age and territorial behaviour of individual earthworms. Importantly, in any earthworm species the density variations in the reproducing generation had significant consequences for the advancing generation, affecting either the numbers or/and the size (individual weight) of the cocoons produced.

This study describes the metabolic activity of dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus throughout its early development, from hatchling to settlement stage. Standard, routine and active metabolic rates (SMR, RMR and AMR, respectively) were assessed to determine the species' metabolic scope and identify how metabolism changes with growth and development. Distinct metabolic changes occurred in association with developmental changes during the early life stages, with flexion-stage larvae showing significantly reduced metabolic scope (approx. 0.30 mu mol O-2 ind.(-1) h(-1)), representing an energy bottleneck. Based on these findings, it is likely that larvae of A. japonicus are most susceptible to environmental perturbations during flexion. The variability of metabolic rates during the diel cycle was also assessed and revealed that the early-stage larvae showed no preference for daylight, although settlement-stage juveniles were more active during daylight hours (RMR = 12.78 mu mol O-2 ind.(-1) h(-1)) than at night (RMR = 5.87 mu mol O-2 ind.(-1) h(-1)).

In shaded environments, plants must respond to reduced light intensity to ensure a regular rate of photosynthesis to maintain the dynamic balance of nutrients, such as leaf non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). To improve our understanding of the nutrient utilization strategies of understory shade-tolerant plants, we compared the variations in leaf NSCs, C, N and P in response to heterogeneous controlled light conditions between two subtropical evergreen broadleaf shade-tolerant species, Elaeocarpus sylvestris (E. sylvestris) and Illicium henryi (I. henrys). Light intensity treatments were applied at five levels (100%, 52%, 33%, 15% and 6% full sunlight) for 30 weeks to identify the effects of reduced light intensity on leaf NSC allocation patterns and leaf C:N:P stoichiometry characteristics. We found that leaf soluble sugar, starch and NSC concentrations in E. sylvestris showed decreasing trends with reduced light intensity, whereas I. henryi presented slightly increasing trends from 100% to 15% full sunlight and then significant decreases at extremely low light intensity (6% full sunlight). The soluble sugar/starch ratio of E. sylvestris decreased with decreasing light intensity, whereas that of I. henryi remained stable. Moreover, both species exhibited increasing trends in leaf N and P concentrations but limited leaf N:P and C:P ratio fluctuations with decreasing light intensity, revealing their adaptive strategies for poor light environments and their growth strategies under ideal light environments. There were highly significant correlations between leaf NSC variables and C:N:P stoichiometric variables in both species, revealing a trade-off in photosynthesis production between leaf NSC and carbon allocation. Thus, shade-tolerant plants readjusted their allocation of leaf NSCs, C, N and P in response to light acclimation. Redundancy analysis showed that leaf morphological features of both E. sylvestris and I. henryi affected their corresponding leaf nutrient traits. These results improve our understanding of the dynamic balance between leaf NSCs and leaf C, N and P components in the nutritional metabolism of shade-tolerant plants.

In this region, grassland dynamics are tightly linked to available moisture, yet it has proven difficult to resolve what aspects of climate drive vegetation change. In part, this is because it is unclear how heterogeneity in soils affects plant responses to climate. Here, we combine climate and soil properties with a mechanistic soil water model to explain temporal fluctuations in perennial grass cover, quantify where and the degree to which incorporating soil water dynamics enhances our ability to understand temporal patterns, and explore the potential consequences of climate change by assessing future trajectories of important climate and soil water variables. Our analyses focused on long-term (20-56 years) perennial grass dynamics across the Colorado Plateau, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Desert regions. Our results suggest that climate variability has negative effects on grass cover, and that precipitation subsidies that extend growing seasons are beneficial. Soil water metrics, including the number of dry days and availability of water from deeper (>30 cm) soil layers, explained additional grass cover variability. While individual climate variables were ranked as more important in explaining grass cover, collectively soil water accounted for 40-60% of the total explained variance. Soil water conditions were more useful for understanding the responses of C-3 than C-4 grass species. Projections of water balance variables under climate change indicate that conditions that currently support perennial grasses will be less common in the future, and these altered conditions will be more pronounced in the Chihuahuan Desert and Colorado Plateau. We conclude that incorporating multiple aspects of climate and accounting for soil variability can improve our ability to understand patterns, identify areas of vulnerability, and predict the future of desert grasslands.",,,,,"Bradford, John/E-5545-2011","Bradford, John/0000-0001-9257-6303; Duniway, Michael/0000-0002-9643-2785",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,NOV,2015,21,11,,,,,4049,4062,,10.1111/gcb.13043,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13043,,,,,,,,26183431,,,,,WOS:000364777200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The water table at this site was lowered by drainage and by excluding precipitation; three nonmanipulated control plots (C1-3) served as a reference. We found no significant differences in soil respiration (R-Soil), gross primary production (GPP), or aboveground respiration (R-AG) between the C1-3 and D1-3 plots in any of the measurement years. The water table on the control plots was naturally low, with a median water table (2006-2008) of 8 cm below the surface, and even lower during summer when respiratory activity was highest, with median values (C1-3) between 11 and 19 cm below the surface. If it is assumed that oxygen availability in the uppermost 10 cm was not limited by the location of the water table, manipulative lowering of the water table most likely increased oxygen availability only in deeper peat layers where we expect R-Soil to be limited by poor substrate quality rather than anoxia. This could explain the lack of a manipulation effect. In a second approach, we estimated the influence of the water table on R-Soil irrespective of treatment. The results showed a significant correlation between R-Soil and water table, but with R-Soil decreasing at lower water tables rather than increasing. We thus conclude that decomposition in the litter layer is not limited by waterlogging in summer, and deeper peat layers bear no significant decomposition potential due to poor substrate quality. Consequently, we do not expect enhanced C losses from this site due to increasing frequency of dry summers. Assimilation and respiration of aboveground vegetation were not affected by water table fluctuations between 10 and >60 cm depth, indicating the lack of stress resulting from either anoxia (high water table) or drought (low water table).",,,,,,"Muhr, Jan/0000-0001-5264-0243",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,,,,,MAR,2011,21,2,,,,,391,401,,10.1890/09-1251.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-1251.1,,,,,,,,21563571,,,,,WOS:000289893500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Now, researchers have employed haploid inducers to generate reciprocal cybrids to disentangle the specific contributions of organellar variations to plant performance. Assessment of the impact of variation in chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA (collectively termed the plasmotype) on plant phenotypes is challenging due to the difficulty in separating their effect from nuclear-derived variation (the nucleotype). Haploid-inducer lines can be used as efficient plasmotype donors to generate new plasmotype-nucleotype combinations (cybrids)(1). We generated a panel comprising all possible cybrids of seven Arabidopsis thaliana accessions and extensively phenotyped these lines for 1,859 phenotypes under both stable and fluctuating conditions. We show that natural variation in the plasmotype results in both additive and epistatic effects across all phenotypic categories. Plasmotypes that induce more additive phenotypic changes also cause more epistatic effects, suggesting a possible common basis for both additive and epistatic effects. On average, epistatic interactions explained twice as much of the variance in phenotypes as additive plasmotype effects. The impact of plasmotypic variation was also more pronounced under fluctuating and stressful environmental conditions. Thus, the phenotypic impact of variation in plasmotypes is the outcome of multi-level nucleotype-plasmotype-environment interactions and, as such, the plasmotype is likely to serve as a reservoir of variation that is predominantly exposed under certain conditions. The production of cybrids using haploid inducers is a rapid and precise method for assessment of the phenotypic effects of natural variation in organellar genomes. It will facilitate efficient screening of unique nucleotype-plasmotype combinations to both improve our understanding of natural variation in these combinations and identify favourable combinations to enhance plant performance.",,,,,"Aarts, Mark/O-1706-2019; Aarts, Mark G.M./G-8929-2013; Kruijer, Willem/AAJ-7245-2020; Hageman, Jos/N-1221-2015","Aarts, Mark/0000-0001-5257-0740; Aarts, Mark G.M./0000-0001-5257-0740; Wijfjes, Raul/0000-0003-0806-2911; Hageman, Jos/0000-0002-5868-587X; Flood, Padraic/0000-0002-7196-9754; Mumm, Roland/0000-0002-0603-1508; Theeuwen, Tom/0000-0003-3584-3609",,,,,,,,,,,,,2055-026X,2055-0278,,,,JAN,2020,6,1,,,,,13,+,,10.1038/s41477-019-0575-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41477-019-0575-9,,JAN 2020,,,,,,31932677,,,,,WOS:000508165000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

We investigated the effects of acute H/R stress (15 min at similar to 0% O-2 and 10 min reoxygenation) on isolated mitochondria from the gill and the digestive gland of C. gigas respiring on different substrates (pyruvate, glutamate, succinate, palmitate and their mixtures). Gill mitochondria showed better capacity for amino acid and fatty acid oxidation compared with mitochondria from the digestive gland. Mitochondrial responses to H/R stress strongly depended on the substrate and the activity state of mitochondria. In mitochondria oxidizing NADH-linked substrates, exposure to H/R stress suppressed oxygen consumption and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the resting state, whereas in the ADP-stimulated state, ROS production increased despite little change in respiration. As a result, electron leak (measured as H2O2 to O-2 ratio) increased after H/R stress in the ADP-stimulated mitochondria with NADH-linked substrates. In contrast, H/R exposure stimulated succinate-driven respiration without an increase in electron leak. Reverse electron transport (RET) did not significantly contribute to succinate-driven ROS production in oyster mitochondria except for a slight increase in the OXPHOS state during post-hypoxic recovery. A decrease in NADH-driven respiration and ROS production, enhanced capacity for succinate oxidation and resistance to RET might assist in post-hypoxic recovery of oysters mitigating oxidative stress and supporting rapid ATP re-synthesis during oxygen fluctuations, as is commonly observed in estuaries and intertidal zones.",,,,,"Sokolova, Inna/B-4955-2009","Sokolova, Inna/0000-0002-2068-4302; Adzigbli, Linda/0000-0002-8003-1864",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JAN,2022,225,1,,,,,,,jeb243304,10.1242/jeb.243304,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.243304,,,,,,,,34904172,,,,,WOS:000749280000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most near-surface seeds produced seedlings.

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) concentration measured by Western blotting changed reversibly with light intensity.

However, we know little of how the insect immune system fluctuates with season, particularly in the overwintering period. To understand how immune activity changes across autumn, winter, and spring, we tracked immune activity of three temperate insects that overwinter as larvae: a weevil (Curculio sp., Coleoptera), gallfly (Eurosta solidaginis, Diptera), and larvae of the lepidopteran Pyrrharctia isabella. We measured baseline circulating hemocyte numbers, phenoloxidase activity, and humoral antimicrobial activity, as well as survival of fungal infection and melanization response at 12 degrees C and 25 degrees C to capture any potential plasticity in thermal performance. In Curculio sp. and E. solidaginis, hemocyte concentrations remained unchanged across seasons and antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria was lowest in autumn; however, Curculio sp. were less likely to survive fungal infection in autumn, whereas E. solidaginis were less likely to survive infection during the winter. Furthermore, hemocyte concentrations and antimicrobial activity decreased in P. isabella overwintering beneath snow cover. Overall, seasonal changes in activity were largely species dependent, thus it may be difficult to create generalizable predictions about the effects of a changing climate on seasonal immune activity in insects. However, we suggest that the relationship between the response to multiple stressors (e.g., cold and pathogens) drives changes in immune activity, and that understanding the physiology underlying these relationships will inform our predictions of the effects of environmental change on insect overwintering success.

We address the modelling of the distribution of high concentrations of a dispersing passive scalar at large Peclet number, concentrating on the case of steady releases. We argue, from the physical character of the small-scale processes, and from the statistical theory of extreme values, that the high concentrations can be fitted well by a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). This is supported by evidence from a range of experiments. We show, furthermore, that if this is the case then the ratios of successive high-order absolute moments of the scalar concentration are linearly related to the reciprocal of the order. The linear fit thus obtained allows the GPD parameters to be determined from the moments. In this way the moments can be used to deduce the properties of the high concentrations, in particular the maximum possible concentration theta(max) = theta(max)(x). We argue, on general physical grounds, that theta(max)/C-0 (where C-0 = C-0(X) is the centreline mean concentration, and X is the downstream distance from the source) decreases to zero very far from the centreline, but that the decrease takes place on a length scale much larger than the mean plume width (because it is controlled by the relatively slowly acting molecular diffusion, rather than the fast turbulent advection). Thus, over the distances for which accurate measurements can be made, we expect theta(max)/C-0 to be approximately constant throughout the plume cross-section. On the centreline, we argue that theta(max)/C-0 increases downstream from the source, reaches a maximum and then decreases, ultimately tending to I far downstream. In support of these deductions we present results for some high-quality data for a steady line source in wind tunnel grid turbulence. Finally, we apply to this problem some existing models for the relationships between moments. By considering the behaviour far from the centreline in these models, and linking the moments to the high concentrations, we derive relationships between the model parameters. This allows us to derive an expression for theta(max)/C-0 which depends on a total of 5 parameters, and (weakly) on C/C-0 (where C = C (x) is the local mean concentration).

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) worked as signal transduction molecule to accelerate plant response at abiotic stress conditions, the accumulation of which caused oxidative damage. Understanding the underlying effect of combined stress on the ROS metabolism and antioxidant mechanism in plant is a prerequisite for crop improvement in a changing climate. We aimed to explore the distinct response of the ROS production and its scavenging system in tomato at single and combined stress and to elucidate the crosstalk of tolerance mechanism. Thereby, dynamic changes in ROS metabolism and antioxidant mechanism in tomatoes at control, drought, heat and drought + heat (combined stress) were investigated. Two tomato cultivars (Sufen 14: CV1, Jinlingmeiyu: CV2) were applied to compare the cultivar difference. 6 days of drought and combined stress led to a sharp increase in H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) content and O-2 (center dot-) (superoxide radicals) production speed of both cultivars even though there were fluctuations from day 1 to day 5. Dramatic increase of SOD and APX activity and significant decrease of CAT activity occurred in both cultivars at all stresses on day 3. In contrast, combined stress significantly depressed the POD and CAT activity in both cultivars on day 6. The significant increase in MDA content was observed in CV1 at drought and combined stress and in CV2 at three stresses. Meanwhile, combined stress induced significant decrease in proline content only in CV1. The canopy area and stem diameter of both cultivars at the combined stress were smaller than single stress. We found that there was cultivar variation in heat tolerance but not in drought and combined stress tolerance. In conclusion, the stress tolerance of tomatoes at drought and heat is closely associated with its ability to respond to oxidative damage and regulation of ROS scavenging system with unique ROS response induced by the combined stress. This study not only increases our understanding of the complex ROS responses in plants to abiotic stress, but also provides knowledge to improve crop tolerance.",,,,,"Yu, Xiaqing/AAR-1123-2021","Yu, Xiaqing/0000-0002-4545-4781; Ottosen, Carl-Otto/0000-0002-9615-4324; Zhou, Rong/0000-0001-5755-1258",,,,,,,,,,,,,0137-5881,1861-1664,,,,FEB,2019,41,2,,,,,,,20,10.1007/s11738-019-2805-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-019-2805-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000458056600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Coastal and brackish water communities are expected to be less affected by ocean acidification (OA) as these communities are typically adapted to high fluctuations in CO2 and pH. Here we investigate the response of a coastal brackish water plankton community to increasing CO2 levels as projected for the coming decades and the end of this century in terms of community and biochemical fatty acid (FA) composition. A Baltic Sea plankton community was enclosed in a set of offshore mesocosms and subjected to a CO2 gradient ranging from natural concentrations (similar to 347 mu atm fCO(2)) up to values projected for the year 2100 (similar to 1333 mu atm fCO(2)). We show that the phytoplankton community composition was resilient to CO2 and did not diverge between the treatments. Seston FA composition was influenced by community composition, which in turn was driven by silicate and phosphate limitation in the mesocosms and showed no difference between the CO2 treatments. These results suggest that CO2 effects are dampened in coastal communities that already experience high natural fluctuations in pCO(2).

This species reproduces year-round on the Amazon Coast, which is subjected to strong seasonal fluctuations in salinity due to the local precipitation regime. Upogebia vasquezi larvae developed optimally in salinity close to that of seawater (20-35), while low salinities (0, 5, and 10) did not support the survival of the larvae. Only zoeal stages I, II, and III were captured in the field and were more abundant at the higher end of the salinity gradient, in the areas closest to the adjacent coastal waters. Data from both the laboratory and the field data emphasized the low survival potential of the larvae in low salinities, and increased survival and improved development in more saline water.

These areas are characterized by strong and variable SSS gradients [several practical salinity units (psu)] on relatively small scales: the extent of river plumes is highly variable, typically at kilometric and daily scales. Monitoring this variability from SMOS measurements is particularly challenging because of their resolution (typically 30-100 km) and because of the contamination by the nearby land. A set of academic tests was conducted with a linear coastline and constant geophysical parameters, and more realistic tests were conducted over the Bay of Biscay. The bias of the retrieved SSS has been analyzed, as well as the root mean square (rms) of the bias, and the retrieved SSS compared to a numerical hydrodynamic model in the semirealistic case. The academic study showed that the Blackman apodization window provides the best compromise in terms of magnitude and fluctuations of the bias of the retrieved SSS. Whatever the type of vegetation cover, a strong negative bias, greater than I psu, was found when nearer than 36 km from the coast. Between 44 and 80 km, the type of vegetation cover has an impact of less than a factor 2 on the bias, and no influence further than 80 km from the coast. The semirealistic study conducted in the Bay of Biscay showed a bias over ten days lower than 0.2 psu for distances greater than 47 km, due to an averaging over various geometries (coastline orientation, swath orientation, etc.). The bias showed a weak dependence on the location of the grid point within the swath. Despite the noise on the retrieved SSS, contrasts due to the plume of the Loire River and the Gironde estuary remained detectable on ten-day averaged maps with an rms of 0.57 psu. Finally, imposing thresholds on the major axis of the measurements brought little improvement to the bias, whereas it increased the rms and could lead to strong swath restriction: a 49-km threshold on the major axis resulted in an effective swath of 800-900 km instead of 1200 km.",,,,,"pellarin, thierry/A-2739-2009; Waldteufel, Philippe/AAA-8039-2021; lazure, pascal/L-4596-2015; Boutin, Jacqueline/M-2253-2016","lazure, pascal/0000-0003-2794-8785; Boutin, Jacqueline/0000-0003-2845-4912; Zine, Sonia/0000-0002-2872-0291",,,,,,,,,,,,,0196-2892,1558-0644,,,,JUL,2007,45,7,1,,,,2061,2072,,10.1109/TGRS.2007.894934,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.894934,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000247784400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The perennial umbellifer Apium repens is generally regarded to be a rare species all over its European range. We hypothesized that its rarity might be caused by a restricted regeneration niche, that is, highly specific requirements for sexual regeneration, low seed dispersal potential and low endurance capacity of seeds in the ground. We conducted several experimental investigations on its germination ecology, hydrochorous dispersal potential and soil seed bank properties. Apium repens showed high germination success under a variety of abiotic conditions. Either light or cold-wet stratification was necessary to stimulate germination. Seeds were able to float for more than 50 days when protected from precipitation, and soil seed bank sampling revealed that at least some seeds of A. repens were contained in soil depths of up to 10 cm. Overall, our findings do not support the hypothesis that the rarity of A. repens is caused by highly specific requirements for its sexual regeneration.

Whilst the effects on growth and morphology are fairly well understood, little is known about how calcium availability affects other aspects of gastropod biology. Lymnaea stagnalis ( L.) is considered a calciphile and exhibits reduced growth and survival in environments containing less than 20 mg l(-1) Ca(2+). Many freshwater systems exhibit fluctuations in calcium concentration over time: where calcium levels are normally high there may be periods of low [ Ca2+], for example following periods of flooding. Here we examined the effects of acute periods of low (20 mg l(-1)) environmental calcium on the physiology and behaviour of L. stagnalis, specifically measuring how locomotion and respiration differ between high calcium (80 mg l(-1)) and low calcium (20 mg l(-1)) environments. We found that in a low calcium environment crawling speed is reduced, and that this coincides with an increase in cutaneous respiration, indicating that the increased metabolic demands of calcium acquisition at low [ Ca2+] reduce the energy available for locomotion. Conversely we found a decrease in aerial respiration in hypoxic conditions in the low calcium relative to the high calcium environment. In conclusion, we found that acute exposure to low environmental calcium has a highly significant effect on locomotion and respiration, which may have consequences for snail fitness when no morphological effects are apparent.",,,,,,"Dalesman, Sarah/0000-0001-8548-3096",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,MAY 1,2010,213,9,,,,,1471,1476,,10.1242/jeb.040493,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.040493,,,,,,,,20400631,,,,,WOS:000276787200018,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this purpose, gas-tracer tests can be conducted, and reaeration rate coefficients are determined from the decrease in gas concentration along the river stretch. The typical procedure for analysis of such tests is based on simplifying assumptions, as it neglects dispersion altogether and does not consider possible fluctuations and trends in the input signal. We mathematically derive the influence of these non-idealities on estimated reaeration rates and how they are propagated onto the evaluation of aerobic respiration and photosynthesis rates from oxygen monitoring. We apply the approach to field data obtained from a gas-tracer test using propane in a second-order stream in Southwest Germany. We calculate the reaeration rate coefficients accounting for dispersion as well as trends and uncertainty in the input signals and compare them to the standard approach. We show that neglecting dispersion significantly underestimates reaeration, and results between sections cannot be compared if trends in the input signal of the gas tracer are disregarded. Using time series of dissolved oxygen and the various estimates of reaeration, we infer respiration and photosynthesis rates for the same stream section, demonstrating that the bias and uncertainty of reaeration using the different approaches significantly affects the calculation of metabolic rates.

Rational farmers seek to avoid large losses. Future climate change and energy price fluctuations therefore make adaptating to increased risks particularly important for them. Managing soil natural capital-the capacity of the soil to generate ecosystem services of benefit to farmers-has been proven to generate the double dividend: increasing farm profit and reducing associated risk. In this paper we explore whether managing soil natural capital has a third dividend: reducing the downside risk (increasing the positive skewness of profit). This we refer to as the prudence effect which can be viewed as an adaptation strategy for dealing with future uncertainties through more prudent management of soil natural capital. We do this by developing a dynamic stochastic portfolio model to optimize the stock of soil natural capital-as indicated by soil organic carbon (SOC) content-that considers the mean, variance and skewness of profits from arable farming. The SOC state variable can be managed by the farmer only indirectly through the spatial and temporal allocation of land use. We model four cash crops and a grass ley that generates no market return but replenishes SOC. We find that managing soil natural capital can, not only improve farm profit while reducing the risk, but also reduce the downside risk. Prudent adaptation to future risks should therefore consider the impact of current agricultural management practices on the stock of soil natural capital.",,,,,"cong, ronggang/AAJ-4639-2021; Brady, Mark/J-6313-2014; Cong, Rong-Gang/F-5489-2012","Brady, Mark/0000-0001-9773-9722; Termansen, Mette/0000-0003-4875-2810; Cong, Rong-Gang/0000-0003-3506-2095",,,,,,,,,,,,,0254-5330,1572-9338,,,,AUG,2017,255,1-2,,,,,439,463,,10.1007/s10479-015-2066-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-015-2066-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000406401200022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Changes in salinity may be gradual or abrupt; for example, heavy rainfall or evaporation during warm periods can either decrease or increase salinity. Trematodes are the most common parasites in intertidal ecosystems and their transmission is known to be highly influenced by environmental conditions. However, effects of salinity on the transmission of intertidal trematodes are not well studied. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term (i.e. several weeks) exposure to different salinities (25, 30, 35 and 40 psu) on the transmission of Maritrema novaezealandensis from its first intermediate snail host (Zeacumantus subcarinatus) to a second intermediate amphipod host (Paracalliope novizealandiae), in order to evaluate overall net effects. The following steps were assessed: output of parasite transmission stages (cercariae) from infected snail hosts, survival and infectivity of cercariae, susceptibility of amphipod hosts to infection and survival of amphipod hosts including parasite development within amphipod hosts. Output and survival of cercariae increased with increasing salinity whilst infectivity of cercariae and susceptibility of amphipods to infection were not clearly affected. Survival of amphipods was significantly longer at lower salinities and parasite development in infected amphipods was concomitantly more advanced. Overall, the results suggest that the parasite and the amphipods are differentially affected, and that under normal to increased salinities conditions are more favourable for the parasite than for the amphipod host.

Previous research on green roofs confined to a single climate zone with a single set of properties, lacking comparative studies. In this study, a simulation was used for determination of the optimal parameter settings for green roofs in different climate zones. Firstly, a simulation model was established, and a field experiment examined the bias of the model. Leaf area index, plant height, and soil thickness were used as variables. Harbin, Beijing, Chongqing, and Guangzhou were selected as representative cities of four climate zones in China. For quantification of energy savings and indoor thermal comfort improvements, both cool and conventional roofs were simulated alongside green roofs for comparison. Optimal parameters of green roofs were found to be closely related to meteorological conditions in each city. In terms of energy savings, the recommended soil thickness and leaf area index in the four cities are 0.3 m and 0.5, respectively. The optimal plant height is 0.3 m, except in Beijing, where it is 0.1 m. Optimized green roofs are recommended for heating-dominated cities, while cool and green roofs perform similarly in cooling-dominated areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

For logistical reasons, seed that has been stored for varying lengths of time is often used for pasture establishment and agronomy experiments. However, the implications of storage on hard seed physiology are unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of seed storage on its subsequent pattern of hard seed breakdown when exposed to field conditions. Experiments examined seed from six different annual legume genotypes that had been either produced the prior year or stored under ambient conditions for 11-22 years. Comparisons were then made between the two seed sources on hard seed breakdown patterns in situ. Although initial hard seed levels were mostly unaffected by storage (seed of five genotypes remained over 93% hard after more than 11 years of storage), the patterns of release from dormancy during exposure to hard seed breakdown conditions of stored seed differed greatly (p < .05) from freshly produced seed. Hard seed in thestoredseed of most genotypes was reduced from >90% to <10% within 68 days over autumn, with shallow burial, whereasfreshseed remained >90% hard during the same period.

First, using both P. longipennis and L. luctuosa, we isolated interspecific and intraspecific pairs of larval dragonflies of different size differentials to determine how the size and species identity might influence IGP rates. In tandem, we conducted a year-long mesocosm experiment with all three species to assess how simulated warming and heat waves influenced the resulting adult dragonfly assemblages. IGP trials revealed that P. longipennis individuals were much more likely to engage in IGP than L. luctuosa, regardless of size differential. In the mesocosm experiment, emerging adult assemblages were dominated by P. longipennis individuals, a pattern that was most pronounced in the control treatment. Our results indicate that while P. longipennis may be the competitively dominant species under current ambient conditions, warming may alter this dynamic and lessen the dominance of this species on the resulting assemblage composition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,JUN,2022,47,3,,,,,284,295,,10.1111/een.13112,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.13112,,NOV 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000723206900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seedlings may subsequently be subjected to submergence resulting from fluctuations of the water level. Seedling survival depends on tolerance to total or partial submersion. In particular, the response to short submergence periods may be related to the tolerance of green tissues. Three-month-old plants were partially or totally submerged in tanks for 2-17 days, and subsequently re-exposed to the air. The effects of submergence on photosystem II (PSII) activity and pigment contents and the reversibility of changes were analysed at the level of individual leaves. Pigment contents decreased during submergence and failed to recover following a return to non-submerged conditions. PSII photochemical efficiency was affected by submergence and exhibited varying recovery levels depending on duration and degree of submergence. Emerged leaves of partially submerged plants displayed an increase in both photochemical efficiency in the light adapted state and in pigment content, whereas submerged leaves of the same plants were negatively affected and did not recover. The effects of short-term stress were found to be reversible. Over longer periods, partially submerged reed favoured top emerged leaves at the expense of submerged ones, thus suggesting short-term avoidance of anoxia rather than tolerance.

This catalysis-induced enzyme movement will result in increased intracellular motion, which in turn can compromise biomolecular functions. Once the increased intracellular motion has a detrimental effect on regulatory mechanisms, this will establish a feedback mechanism on metabolic activity, and result in the observed thermodynamic limit.

Little is known about the mechanisms that govern plasticity and adaptability or how global changes will influence these relationships across multiple generations. Here, we exposed the emerging model marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to conditions simulating ocean warming and acidification, in isolation and in combination over five generations to identify: (i) how multiple versus single global change drivers alter both juvenile and adult life-history traits; (ii) the mechanistic link between adult physiological and fitness-related life-history traits; and (iii) whether the phenotypic changes observed over multiple generations are of plastic and/or adaptive origin. Two juvenile (developmental rate; survival to sexual maturity) and two adult (average reproductive body size; fecundity) life-history traits were measured in each generation, in addition to three physiological (cellular reactive oxygen species content, mitochondrial density, mitochondrial capacity) traits. We found that multi-generational exposure to warming alone caused an increase in juvenile developmental rate, reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial density, decreases in average reproductive body size and fecundity, and fluctuations in mitochondrial capacity, relative to control conditions. Exposure to ocean acidification alone had only minor effects on juvenile developmental rate. Remarkably, when both drivers of global change were present, only mitochondrial capacity was significantly affected, suggesting that ocean warming and acidification act as opposing vectors of stress across multiple generations.",,,,,"Jarrold, Michael D./AAC-4534-2019; N'Siala, Gloria Massamba/AAD-9359-2021","Jarrold, Michael D./0000-0003-4224-9683; Calosi, Piero/0000-0003-3378-2603",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,FEB 15,2017,220,4,,,,,551,563,,10.1242/jeb.149989,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.149989,,,,,,,,27903701,,,,,WOS:000394106400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Paternal phenotype, maternal, and offspring environment may crucially influence these traits, but to my knowledge, their combined effects have not yet been tested. Here, I found that in bulb mites (Rhizoglyphus robini), maternal nutrition, offspring nutrition, and paternal phenotype (males are fighters, able to kill other mites, or benign scramblers) interactively affected offspring age and size at maturity. The largest effect occurred when both maternal and offspring nutrition was poor: in that case offspring from fighter sires required a significantly longer development time than offspring from scrambler sires. Investigating parental effects on the relationship between age and size at maturity revealed no paternal effects, and only for females was its shape influenced by maternal nutrition. Overall, this reaction norm was nonlinear.

Additionally, introductions of invasive species are creating biotic pressures within coastal ecosystems, which can influence biological interactions. With the recent development of combining comparative functional responses, prey switching and biotic resistance theory in invasion ecology, invasion success and ecological impacts of invaders can be better quantified. Further, the incorporation of environmental contexts with these approaches allows predictions of invader success under a range of ecological scenarios. We examined the functional responses and prey switching propensities of the native European green crab, Carcinus maenas (Linnaeus, 1758), towards native blue mussels, Mytilus edulis (Linnaeus, 1758), and invasive Pacific oysters, Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas (Thunberg, 1793), under the abiotic contexts of season (winter vs summer) and hydrodynamic disturbance level (high vs low). In general, when each prey species was offered separately, C. maenas maximum feeding rates were higher towards native M. edulis compared to invasive C. gigas. In addition, handling times were lower, and thus maximum feeding rates were higher, in summer compared to winter. Hydrodynamic disturbance level had no significant influence on handling times or maximum feeding rates towards either prey species. When prey species were offered simultaneously, C. maenas disproportionately consumed native M. edulis over invasive C. gigas irrespective of proportional availability. In addition, increased hydrodynamic disturbance further increased the disproportionate consumption of M. edulis over C. gigas. We thus demonstrate that C. maenas offers little biotic resistance to invasions of C. gigas under a range of abiotic contexts, and indeed some of these contexts may exacerbate the invasion. We suggest that combined functional response and prey switching studies provide a wealth of information regarding invasion success and biotic resistance towards invasive species under environmental variation.",,,,,"Joyce, Patrick/ABB-9341-2020","Joyce, Patrick/0000-0003-1058-7901",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,JUL,2020,528,,,,,,,,151382,10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151382,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151382,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000536176500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Maternal FS change did not influence hatchling yolk-free BW; however, breeders given more FS produced progeny with heavier tibias and shanks and longer femurs compared with those provided with similar FS, but only when breeders were fed on maize. Moreover, increased maternal FS at photostimulation was associated with an increased RA of femur length in the progeny.7.

The light period was 11 h, natural light supplemented by constant artificial illumination, with a step-transition to a 13 h dark period, Uptake of all three ions showed a broadly similar pattern of diurnal variation, rates increasing during the light period and decreasing during the darkness to a minimum within +/-2 h of the end of the dark period. The amplitude was greatest during high-irradiance days, and both proportionately and absolutely greater for NH4+ (mean min:max uptake=0.24) than NO3- (min:max=0.41) or K+ (min:max=0.34). There were significant differences between NH4+ and the other two ions (NO3- and K+) whose behaviour coincided in almost all respects, in timing of maximum and minimum rates, and acceleration in uptake during the light period.

The use of son, plant and environmental sensors can monitor plant hydric status and optimize water application. Linear resistance dendrometers were developed and installed in a high-density 8-year old commercial mango orchard during two seasons; 10 in 2019 and 40 in 2020. Stem diameter fluctuations were acquired every 10 minutes to obtain maximum diameter (MXD), minimum diameter (MND), morning slope (MS) and afternoon slope (AS). Mango stem response during flowering, fruit-fall and fruit-growth was analyzed after applying daily irrigation (DI) or reduced deficit irrigation (RDI). Yield was similar for both treatments, but water use efficiency was higher with deficit irrigation. A new variable known as negative integral (NI) was obtained from the dendrometer signature after adding all the values between 8:00 and 18:00. NI provided a stem shrinkage magnitude, peaks attributed to transpiration and slopes showing flow transport to and from the trunk. NI presented a high correlation of 0.85 against T7 during the flowering stage for RDI-1. If NI crossed zero, a severe stress was present; a high AS present in the evening, indicates nutrient solution provided to fruits. Fruit yield depends on panicle number and fruit-drop during the first production stages, being RDI-1 more efficient in retaining fruits.",,,,,,"GARCIA MARTINEZ, JESUS ANTONIO/0000-0002-7697-6590",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-8362,1553-8621,,,,DEC 31,2022,22,1,,,,,35,56,,10.1080/15538362.2021.1970080,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15538362.2021.1970080,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000738763000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We then measured the critical swimming speed (U-crit) and metabolic rate (MR) of hypoxia-acclimated and non-acclimated fish (under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions). The feeding rate (FR), feeding efficiency (FE) and specific growth rate (SGR) of fish in hypoxia-acclimated and non-acclimated groups were also measured. The P-crit, ASR and LOE of hypoxia-acclimated fish were significantly lower than those of non-acclimated fish. Hypoxia acclimation resulted in a significantly higher U-crit when the individuals swam in hypoxia. The U-crit, maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and metabolic scope (MS) of both the hypoxia-acclimated and non-acclimated fish all decreased with the decrease of DO. However, the U-crit, MMR and MS decreased by 31, 43 and 54%, respectively, in non-acclimated fish, whereas these values decreased by 15, 28 and 29%, respectively, in hypoxia-acclimated fish, which suggests that hypoxia-acclimated fish were less sensitive to the DO decrease. The FR, FE and SGR all decreased by 21, 20 and 45%, respectively, in the hypoxia-acclimated group compared to the non-acclimated group. This result suggests that diel-cycling hypoxia acclimation improved the hypoxia tolerance and aerobic swimming performance of southern catfish, whereas impaired the growth performance. The high hypoxia tolerance and physiological plasticity to hypoxia-acclimated southern catfish may be related to its lower maintenance energy expenditure, sit-and-wait lifestyle and bottom-dwelling living environment condition (usually facing oxygen fluctuation). The growth performance of so-called 'visceral type' fish species, such as southern catfish, are more sensitive to hypoxia compared to other fish species because of their high peak post-prandial metabolic rate, which may be restrained by the limited aerobic metabolic scope in hypoxia.

Recent TOPEX/Poseidon observations argue oceanic first-mode planetary waves move with speeds other than those predicted by simple theory. These data have prompted theoretical analyses of wave propagation in a mean flow, with the results suggesting mean shear can have a controlling effect on the planetary wave guide. Some of the predicted effects appear to be relevant to the observations, while others are less obvious. This, coupled with other explanations for the observations, motivates the calculations. Based on these experiments, the authors suggest that the predicted effects of mean shear on wave propagation are consistent with those computed in a fully geostrophically turbulent ocean. These are that a two-layer model misses the dominant component of long-wave interaction with a mean flow, a three-layer model captures this interaction qualitatively, and the correction to wave propagation is in the direction opposite to the mean flow.

We evaluated whether divergent patterns of chick development among wedge-tailed shearwater Puffinus pacificus populations are facultative responses to short-term fluctuations in food availability, or fixed colony-specific phenomena potentially associated with differences in local resource availability. Supplementary feeding at Heron Island increased food intake to levels equal to, or greater than, those observed at Lord Howe Island. In supplemented chicks, mass accumulation per gram of food received was inversely related to current body stores, up to a maximum storage level set by body size. Significantly, maximum storage was lower for Heron Island than for Lord Howe Island chicks at equivalent body size. In contrast, relative allocation to skeletal growth did not differ between supplemented and control chicks, was not influenced by body condition and did not increase to levels observed at Lord Howe Island. Overall, the present study showed that supplemented chicks were unable to use short-term increases in food availability to increase relative mass stores or rates of skeletal development, implying that both life-history parameters have some colony-specific components that are divergent between the locations of this study.

Variation in NSC pools reflects temporal fluctuations in supply and demand, as well as physiological coordination across tree organs in ways that differ across species and NSC fractions (e.g., soluble sugars vs starch). Using landscape-scale crown (leaves and twigs) NSC concentration measurements in three foundation tree species (Populus tremuloides, Pinus edulis, Juniperus osteosperma), we evaluated in situ, seasonal variation in NSC responses to moisture stress on three timescales: short-term (via predawn water potential), seasonal (via leaf delta C-13) and annual (via current year's ring width index). Crown NSC responses to moisture stress appeared to depend on hydraulic strategy, where J. osteosperma appears to regulate osmotic potentials (via higher sugar concentrations), P. edulis NSC responses suggest respiratory depletion and P. tremuloides responses were consistent with direct sink limitations. We also show that overly simplistic models can mask seasonal and tissue variation in NSC responses, as well as strong interactions among moisture stress at different timescales. In general, our results suggest large seasonal variation in crown NSC concentrations reflecting the multiple cofunctions of NSCs in plant tissues, including storage, growth and osmotic regulation of hydraulically vulnerable leaves. We emphasize that crown NSC pool size cannot be viewed as a simple physiological metric of stress; in situ NSC dynamics are complex, varying temporally, across species, among NSC fractions and among tissue types.",,,,,,"Fell, Michael/0000-0001-9713-749X; Peltier, Drew/0000-0003-3271-9055; Liu, Yao/0000-0003-2783-3291; Guo, Jessica/0000-0002-9566-9182",,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,MAR,2021,41,3,,,,,388,402,,10.1093/treephys/tpaa149,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpaa149,,,,,,,,33147630,,,,,WOS:000637330800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hourly mean discharge had a significant positive effect on swimming muscle activity. However, a large amount of the variance was unexplained, possibly due to social interactions, feeding and/or flow-refuging behaviours. Fluctuating flows were no more energetically costly than stable flows. Discharge magnitude had a significant positive effect on blood cortisol concentrations. Yet, cortisol concentrations were low overall (mean +/- SD = 1.60 +/- 0.09 ng.ml(-1)), suggesting that the small observed response could be the result of routine physiological processes rather than a stress response per se.

Photosynthetic parameters were related to leaf nutrient and carbohydrate status to reveal controls of carbon uptake rate. In ail species, elevated CO2 depressed both the maximum Rubisco catalytic activity (V-c,V-max, by 19-44%) and maximum electron transport rate (J(max) by 13-39%), indicating significant photosynthetic acclimation of both measures. Even so, all species had increased maximum light-saturated rate of net CO2 uptake (A(max)) at the elevated growth CO2 level, due to higher intercellular CO2 concentration (c(i)). Leaf nitrogen concentration was central to photosynthetic performance, correlating with A(max), V-c,V-max and J(max). V-c,V-max and J(max) were linearly cc-correlated, revealing a relatively invariable J(max):V-c,V-max ratio, probably due to N resource optimization between light harvesting (RuBP regeneration) and carboxylation. Leaf total non-structural carbohydrate concentration (primarily starch) increased in high CO2, and was correlated with the reduction in V-c,V-max and J(max). Apparent feedback control of V-c,V-max and J(max) was thus surprisingly consistent across all species, and may regulate carbon exchange in response to end-product fluctuation. If so, elevated CO2 may have emulated an excess end-product condition, triggering both V-c,V-max and J(max) down-regulation. In Leucadendron, a general physiological mechanism seems to control excess carbohydrate formation, and photosynthetic responsiveness to elevated CO2, independently of genotype and nutrient concentration. This mechanism may underlie photosynthetic acclimation to source:sink imbalances resulting from such diverse conditions as elevated CO2, low sink strength, low carbohydrate export, and nutrient limitation.",,,,,"Midgley, Guy F./H-3585-2014; Pammenter, Norman/E-9357-2010","Midgley, Guy F./0000-0001-8264-0869; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,,,,,APR,1999,50,333,,,,,533,542,,10.1093/jexbot/50.333.533,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jexbot/50.333.533,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000079379400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the effectiveness of DMPP varies among soils, and this is due to both abiotic (e.g. soil properties) and biotic factors (e.g. ammonia oxidizers and denitrifier communities). Understanding the nature of these effects is necessary to improve the efficacy of DMPP, therefore encouraging wider adoption and environmental benefits. In particular, soil microbial properties associated with variation in efficacy remain largely unknown. In this study four contrasting arable soils (a grey desert soil, an alluvial paddy soil, a loess formed paddy soil, and a red soil), were characterized based on DMPP inhibition of N2O emissions and associated microbial functional guilds. DMPP significantly inhibited nitrification and N2O emissions, with an average inhibitory rate ranging from 41.7% in a red soil to 90.0% in a grey desert soil. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) exhibited contrasting response patterns to DMPP addition. Notably, suppression of N2O emissions by DMPP only occurred alongside fluctuations in AOB abundance. However, when AOB were inhibited, AOA abundance increased. Soil-dependent response patterns to DMPP were observed for ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in terms of community structure. Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) found that abiotic factors, particularly pH, and biological factors such as ammonia oxidizer communities, were closely linked to N2O emissions. Our findings provide evidence that: (i) DMPP effectively inhibits nitrification through inhibiting the abundance of AOB across soil types; (ii) releasing AOA from the competition with AOB allows AOA to efficiently grow and multiply, even under high ammonium conditions; and (iii) abiotic factors play a more important role than biotic factors in soil N2O emissions.",,,,,"Liang, Yongchao/S-9281-2019; Liang, Yongchao/D-5809-2012; Wakelin, Steve/C-3170-2011","Liang, Yongchao/0000-0002-0501-2823; Liang, Yongchao/0000-0002-0501-2823; Wakelin, Steve/0000-0002-1167-8699",,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0717,,,,,MAR,2019,130,,,,,,82,93,,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.11.027,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.11.027,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000458223500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Differences between diel leaf growth patterns of mono- and dicotyledonous plants correspond to their different organization and placement of growth zones. In monocots, heterotrophic growth zones are organized linearly and protected from the environment by sheaths of older leaves. In contrast, photosynthetically active growth zones of dicot leaves are exposed directly to the environment and show characteristic, species-specific diel growth patterns. It is hypothesized that the different exposure to environmental constraints and simultaneously the sink/source status of the growing organs may have induced distinct endogenous control of diel growth patterns in roots and leaves of monocot and dicot plants.

After 2days of darkness, carbon reserves were depleted in reproductive sinks, and RNA in situ hybridization of marker transcripts showed that carbon starvation responses had been initiated in the meristem, anthers and ovules. Dark treatments of 2 or more days resulted in a bare-segment phenotype on the floral stem, with 23-27 aborted siliques. These resulted from impaired growth of immature siliques and abortion of mature and immature flowers. Depolarization of PIN1 protein and increased DII-VENUS expression pointed to rapid collapse of auxin gradients in the meristem and inhibition of primordia initiation. After transfer back to a light-dark cycle, flowers appeared and formed viable siliques and seeds. A similar phenotype was seen after transfer to sub-compensation point irradiance or CO2. It also appeared in a milder form after a moderate decrease in irradiance and developed spontaneously in short photoperiods. We conclude that Arabidopsis inhibits primordia initiation and aborts flowers and very young siliques in C-limited conditions. This curtails demand, safeguarding meristem function and allowing renewal of reproductive growth when carbon becomes available again. We investigate how reproductive growth responds to a transient shortfall in carbon in the indeterminate weed Arabidopsis. Transfer of long photoperiod-grown plants to continuous darkness or low light or CO2 resulted in massive abortion of flowers and very young siliques but the apex function was maintained, and flowering and seed set resumed when the plants were transferred to a light-dark cycle. The same phenotype appeared spontaneously in short photoperiods, where growth is carbon-limited. This response represents a good strategy to optimize seed formation in a fluctuating environment in indeterminate species but results in a window of vulnerability when flowering is synchronized, as has happened in many crops.",,,,,"Wahl, Vanessa/ABC-3341-2020; Vernoux, Teva/J-1695-2019; Stitt, Mark/GVT-1242-2022; Lunn, John Edward/AAE-9516-2019","Vernoux, Teva/0000-0002-8257-4088; Lunn, John Edward/0000-0001-8533-3004; Lauxmann, Martin Alexander/0000-0003-1162-4858; Annunziata, Maria Grazia/0000-0001-8593-1741; Stitt, Mark/0000-0002-4900-1763; Wahl, Vanessa/0000-0001-7421-8801; Olas, Justyna Jadwiga/0000-0002-4311-6738",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-7791,1365-3040,,,,APR,2016,39,4,,,,,745,767,,10.1111/pce.12634,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.12634,,,,,,,,26351840,,,,,WOS:000373458800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many species of decapod crustaceans reside in areas with fluctuating oxygen regimens. Physiological mechanisms enhance the ability of these crustaceans to cope with acute episodes of hypoxia. Southern king crab, Lithodes santolla, fishery is important in the south of South America, and some data describe fishing zones with low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (3.5 mgO(2) l(-1), i.e., 8.3 kPa). Our main objective was to evaluate the effect of dissolved oxygen level on respiratory metabolism, nutritional physiology, and immunological condition of L. santolla juveniles. Individual animals were exposed for 10 days to different oxygen tensions (2.1, 4.2, 8.5, 12.7, and 21.1 kPa) to quantify the oxygen consumption rate; thereafter, blood oxyhemocyanin (Hc), protein concentration, as well as hemocytes, were sampled. Freeze-dried animals were dissected, and digestive gland metabolites (glycogen, protein, glucose, cholesterol, acylglycerol, and lactate) and digestive enzyme activity (general protease, trypsin, and chymotrypsin), as well as gill lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, were quantified. In the present study, Lithodes santolla showed a critical oxygen tension between 4 and 9 kPa, indicating that this crab species is more sensitive to DO than other crustacean species. Protein and Hc concentrations followed a similar pattern to that of oxygen consumption. Digestive gland glycogen and protein concentration did not change after 10 days at different oxygen exposures, but glucose, cholesterol, and acylglycerol concentrations decreased linearly and proportionally to the available oxygen in the water. As in other decapods, chymotrypsin showed over 90% of the total quantified proteases activity. Chymotrypsin activity together with total proteases and trypsin was not affected by the environmental oxygen tension. Gill LDH and digestive gland lactate followed a similar increase at lower environmental oxygen tension but dropped sharply at the lowest tension (2.1 kPa). Dissolved oxygen affected also the immune system through reduction of hemocytes. This could provide a critical window for opportunistic pathogens to become established when crabs are exposed to hypoxic conditions. L. santolla juveniles show a moderate tolerance to low oxygen availability by modifying the concentration of hemolymph proteins, mainly OxyHc, some digestive gland metabolites, and by activating the anaerobic metabolism. This allows L. santolla juveniles to inhabit temporarily low oxygen zones in the deep ocean and suggests an advantage for culture conditions.",,,,,"Rosas, Carlos/A-7052-2009; Varela, Daniel/D-9484-2013; Gebauer, Paulina/D-8661-2013","Gebauer, Paulina/0000-0001-8319-9868; Pascual Jimenez, Cristina/0000-0002-8789-8102; A, Mauricio/0000-0001-8040-6147; Rosas, Carlos/0000-0002-1301-7368",,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,JAN,2010,157,1,,,,,7,18,,10.1007/s00227-009-1291-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-009-1291-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000272801100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Field experiments were completed in which the physical dimensions of patches infested with cereal aphids, cereal aphid density, and access to patches by coccinellids were varied. Aphid infestations consisted of naturally occurring densities (natural patches) and much greater densities created by supplementing patches with aphids (supplemented patches). Coccinellids were denied access to some supplemented patches (exclusion patches) but allowed unlimited access to others. Densities of adult Hippodamia convergens and Coccinella septem-punctata were correlated with aphid density in patches whereas density of Coleomegilla maculata was not. Aggregation by coccinellids was independent of patch area. The realized aphid population growth rate (r) was lower in supplemented than natural patches in all four trials but was significantly lower in only one trial. The lower r in supplemented patches was not exclusively caused by coccinellid predation, and emigration of aphids from patches probably also contributed, r was significantly greater in exclusion patches than supplemented and natural patches, indicating that coccinellids markedly reduced aphid numbers in patches even when aphid density was extremely high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,,,,,APR,2000,42,1,,,,,81,90,,10.1007/s101440050012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s101440050012,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088009000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, it is imperative to have approaches for monitoring surface fluxes in these regions. The remote sensing-based two-source energy balance (TSEB) model is a suitable method for flux estimation over sparsely vegetated semiarid and arid landscapes since it explicitly considers surface energy flux contributions from soil and vegetation. However, previous studies indicate that TSEB generally underestimates sensible heat flux (H) and hence overestimates latent heat flux (LE) or evapotranspiration for these regions unless soil resistance coefficients are modified based on additional ground information. In this study, TSEB is applied over semiarid and arid regions on three continents using the original soil resistance formulation with modified coefficients and a recently developed physically based soil resistance formulation. Model sensitivity analysis demonstrates the high sensitivity of TSEB with original soil resistance formulation to soil resistance coefficients, while TSEB with the new soil resistance formulation has relatively low sensitivity to uncertainties in all coefficients. The performance of TSEB using different soil resistance formulations is evaluated by comparing modeled H against eddy covariance measurements in six semiarid and arid study sites and ranking the error statistics. Our results indicate that incorporating the new soil resistance formulation into TSEB would enhance its utility in flux estimation over heterogeneous landscapes by obviating its reliance on semiempirical coefficients and thus provide more robust fluxes over sparsely vegetated regions without model calibration and/or parameter tuning.",,,,,"Garcia, Monica/N-1206-2014; Domingo, Francisco/P-7409-2019; Nieto, Hector/C-8136-2009; Anderson, Martha/C-1720-2015; Haghighi, Erfan/J-3450-2013","Garcia, Monica/0000-0002-4587-8920; Domingo, Francisco/0000-0002-7145-7281; Nieto, Hector/0000-0003-4250-6424; Li, Yan/0000-0002-9430-0551; Anderson, Martha/0000-0003-0748-5525; Kustas, William/0000-0001-5727-4350; Haghighi, Erfan/0000-0002-8358-5619",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,FEB,2019,55,2,,,,,1059,1078,,10.1029/2018WR022981,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR022981,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000461858900011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drought and heat are increasing threats to the agricultural and forestry systems, making it urgently necessary to determine the mechanisms of plant adaptation and survival. Proteomics allows for the characterisation of a large number of proteins in a given tissue/organ, providing an integrated picture of the molecular events involved in stress responses. In this paper, we have evaluated the contribution of proteomics for the identification of stress-responsive proteins and tolerance/adaptation mechanisms in woody plants of agronomic importance in the Mediterranean basin. A systematic review was performed (Web of Knowledge, 5th March 2013) on the relevant genera for this region: Quercus sp., Pinus sp., Eucalyptus sp., Vitis sp., Olive sp., and Citrus sp. The term Rosaceae was also included in the search due to the relevance of fruit tree crops of this family in the Mediterranean region. This systematic review highlighted the lack of extensive and comprehensive proteomic analyses for Mediterranean plants under stress. The approach retrieved 19 and 38 papers concerning the assessment of abiotic and biotic stresses, respectively, at the proteome level, and 20 and 46 papers, respectively, concerning analyses at the transcriptomics level. With regard to abiotic stress, gel-based proteomic methodologies (15 papers) enabled the identification and quantification of 395 stress-responsive proteins. These results revealed metabolic adjustments to stress, with major alterations in carbon, nitrogen, and amino acid metabolisms. The most consistently represented stress-responsive proteins were RuBisCO, RuBisCO activase, heat shock proteins, chlorophyll alb binding protein, and proteins from the oxygen-evolving complex. We concluded that gel-based proteomics revealed key proteins and metabolic pathways important for the ability of plants to adjustment to environmental fluctuations. The integration of this information with physiological, agronomic, and technological performance (e.g. survival, productivity, and food and technological quality) is essential for the sustainable development of the Mediterranean regions.

Photoinhibition of photosynthesis was induced by exposure of the algae to a photon fluence rate of 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for 2 h. Changes in the oxygen production rate and in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence were recorded. For oxygen measurements gross P-max and the slope (alpha) of the fluence rate-response curve were determined before and after photoinhibitory treatment and after recovery of photosynthesis in dim light. In fluorescence measurements the kinetics of change of the variable fluorescence during the inhibitory time phase and the recovery phase were determined. Significant differences in the reactions during exposure and recovery were found in the different algal classes. Within each class a correlation between species depth distribution and the ability to cope with high light stress was found. Algae growing in nature close to the water surface or in the intertidal were generally not severely stressed. Algae growing in the middle and upper subtidal zone showed a decrease in photosynthetic activity during high light stress with full recovery of photosynthesis in subsequent dim light. Fluorescence measurements showed that the reaction kinetics of photoinhibition and recovery were slower than in algae growing close to the water surface or in the intertidal. Algae growing in the lower subtidal also showed a decrease in the photosynthetic parameters due to high light stress; however, photosynthesis recovered only slightly and very slowly during subsequent dim light conditions. In these algae the decrease in the photosynthetic activity was caused by photodamage rather than by dynamic photoinhibition. In conclusion these experiments indicate that algae already cultured for a long time in the laboratory, retain a certain genetic adaptation to the natural light environment.

As hypogean organisms experience minimal thermal variation in their native biotopes, they should not be able to develop any particular cold adaptations to cope with thermal fluctuations. Indeed, physiological responses of organisms to an environmental stress are proportional to the amplitude of the stress they endure in their habitats. Surprisingly, previous studies have shown that a population of an aquatic hypogean crustacean, Niphargus rhenorhodanensis, exhibited a high level of cold hardiness. Subterranean environments thus appeared not to be following the classical above-mentioned theory. To confirm this counter-example, we studied seven karstic populations of N. rhenorhodanensis living in aquifers at approximately 10 degrees C all year round and we analysed their behavioural, metabolic and biochemical responses during cold exposure (3 degrees C). These seven populations showed reduced activities, and some cryoprotective molecules were accumulated. More surprisingly, the amplitude of the response varied greatly among the seven populations, despite their exposure to similar thermal conditions. Thus, the overall relationship that can be established between the amplitude of thermal variations and cold-hardiness abilities of ectotherm species may be more complex in subterranean crustaceans than in other arthropods.",,,,,"Douady, Christophe J/N-1357-2014; Douady, Christophe/N-3069-2019","Douady, Christophe J/0000-0002-4503-8040; Douady, Christophe/0000-0002-4503-8040; RENAULT, David/0000-0003-3644-1759; Gravot, Antoine/0000-0001-9125-1494",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUN 15,2009,212,12,,,,,1859,1868,,10.1242/jeb.027987,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.027987,,,,,,,,19483004,,,,,WOS:000266456300020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gibberellins (GAs) are known to play a role in onset of germination of several species. Onset of germination often requires an increase in de novo GA content or an increase in sensitivity to GAs. Reduced germination of seeds incubated in solutions containing compounds that inhibit GA synthesis provide evidence that GAs are required to trigger germination. Trinexapac-ethyl (TE), a GA synthesis inhibitor, is frequently used as a plant growth regulator in crop production. However, to the best of our knowledge, TE has not been used to study the requirement of GAs in onset of germination. Germination studies were conducted using seeds of artichoke thistle and common teasel under a range of TE concentrations (0 to 500 mu M TE), a combined solution of 125 mu M TE + 100 mu M GA(3) for artichoke, and 250 mu M TE + 100 mu M GA(3) for common teasel. Germination tests were conducted at 20/10 C (12-h thermoperiod) in darkness for artichoke and at constant 15 C with 12 h of light for common teasel. Germination of artichoke in 125 mu M TE was reduced to 47% when compared with the check (95%), but the combined TE + GA(3) solution maintained germination at 84%. Germination of common teasel in 250 mu M TE was reduced to 10% when compared with the check (91%), and the combined TE + GA(3) solution increased germination to 63%. These results demonstrate the utility of TE to study the role of GAs in onset of germination.

General trends of the main species were extracted by the Eigen-Filtering method. Principal component analysis and hierarchical classifications were used to identify the successive periods of the series. A comparative analysis of the trend of both series has been made in relation to the hydroclimatic changes observed during the sampling. The patterns were in phase in both communities. Five main periods were identified. The long-term temporal changes of both communities were affected by the Amoco Cadiz oil spill: high mortality in 1978 and reconstitution of the populations destroyed by the hydrocarbons, but also by the climatic changes with a 3-4 yr period and the warming of the seawater over the last decade in relation to the sun Spots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,,,,,,1993,169,2,,,,,181,214,,10.1016/0022-0981(93)90193-R,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(93)90193-R,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LP04800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two gradients proved to be responsible for the macrophyte structure: 1) the depth and light gradient, and 2) the seasonality of water trophy. The depth of occurrence, light conditions and interspecies competition are the key factors determining the production of L. barbatus biomass and oospores. In 2018 mass overwintering of total macrophytes and L. barbatus in mild winter conditions significantly improved lake water quality, indicating that macrophyte communities can protect lakes from the negative consequences of global warming. This research thus demonstrated that macrophytes are a key factor in improving and stabilising water quality of a temperate mesotrophic lake which hosts one of the largest populations of the endangered charophyte.",,,,,"Brzozowski, Michał/AAB-2500-2022","Brzozowski, Michał/0000-0002-8028-2129",,,,,,,,,,,,,0075-9511,1873-5851,,,,JAN,2022,92,,,,,,,,125944,10.1016/j.limno.2021.125944,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2021.125944,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000783213400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

After testing for initial hard seed content in each line, the remaining hard seeds were placed on the soil surface at Kingsthorpe on 15 January 2001. Changes in hard seed levels over the ensuing summer-autumn seed softening period were measured. The initial hard seed content in each species ranged from 20 to 79% in H. coronarium; 31 to 79% in H. carnosum; and 54 to 83% in H. flexuosum. No significant difference in the time of seed softening between accessions or species was identified. Despite the similar timing, the extent of softening varied greatly between accessions and species. The proportion of initially hard seed that softened ranged from 54 to 95% in H. coronarium; 27 to 45% in H. carnosum; and 50 to 74% in H. flexuosum. Accessions of H. coronarium and H. flexuosum softened the greatest proportion of seed between 15 January and 22 February with reducing amounts thereafter. Accessions of H. carnosum softened less seed over this period, appearing to display a slower, more constant rate of softening. Although total hard seed levels were relatively low, there was sufficient variability in hard seed levels to provide some scope for selection of desired hard seed characteristics.",,,,,"Bell, Lindsay/B-9769-2008","Bell, Lindsay/0000-0002-5064-2947",,,,,,,,,,,,,0816-1089,,,,,,2003,43,11,,,,,1303,1310,,10.1071/EA02195,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA02195,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000187341600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Additionally, we compared results between larvae that were frozen at -5 degrees C in the presence of water during RCE and those that were supercooled at -5 degrees C in a dry environment. Although >95% of larvae survived a single 12. h bout of freezing at -5 C, after five cycles of RCE survival of frozen larvae dropped below 70%. Meanwhile, the survival of control and supercooled larvae was unchanged, remaining around 90% for the duration of the study. At the tissue level, frozen larvae had higher rates of cell mortality in the midgut than control and supercooled larvae. Furthermore, larvae that were frozen during RCE experienced a dramatic reduction in energy reserves; after five cycles, frozen larvae had 25% less lipid, 30% less glycogen and nearly 40% less trehalose than supercooled larvae. Finally, larvae that were frozen during RCE had higher expression of hsp70 than those that were supercooled, indicating a higher degree of protein damage in the frozen group. Results were similar between larvae that had accumulated 60h of freezing at -5 degrees C over five cycles of RCE and those that were frozen continuously for 60h, suggesting that the total time spent frozen determines the physiological response. Our results suggest that it is preferable, both from a survival and energetic standpoint, for larvae to seek dry microhabitats where they can avoid inoculative freezing and remain unfrozen during RCE.",,,,,"Teets, Nicholas/H-7386-2013; Kawarasaki, Yuta/AAD-4032-2019","Teets, Nicholas/0000-0003-0963-7457; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAR,2011,214,5,,,,,806,814,,10.1242/jeb.051912,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.051912,,,,,,,,21307067,,,,,WOS:000287130200021,View Full Record in Web of Science
