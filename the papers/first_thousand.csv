Projections suggest that these trends are likely to continue in many regions, particularly in northern latitudes and in arid regions. Despite wide speculation that asymmetric warming has different impacts on plant and ecosystem production than equal-night-and-day warming, there has been little direct comparison of these scenarios. Reduced DTR has also been widely misinterpreted as a result of night-only warming, when in fact T-min occurs near dawn, indicating higher morning as well as night temperatures. We report on the first experiment to examine ecosystem-scale impacts of faster increases in T-min than in T-max, using precise temperature controls to create realistic diurnal temperature profiles with gradual day-night temperature transitions and elevated early morning as well as night temperatures. Studying a constructed grassland ecosystem containing species native to Oregon, USA, we found that the ecosystem lost more carbon at elevated than ambient temperatures, but remained unaffected by the 3 degrees C difference in DTR between symmetric warming (constantly ambient + 3.5 degrees C) and asymmetric warming (dawn T-min = ambient + 5 degrees C, afternoon T-max = ambient + 2 degrees C). Reducing DTR had no apparent effect on photosynthesis, probably because temperatures were most different in the morning and late afternoon when light was low. Respiration was also similar in both warming treatments, because respiration temperature sensitivity was not sufficient to respond to the limited temperature differences between asymmetric and symmetric warming. We concluded that changes in daily mean temperatures, rather than changes in T-min/T-max, were sufficient for predicting ecosystem carbon fluxes in this reconstructed Mediterranean grassland system.",,,,,"Phillips, Claire/AGP-5674-2022","Phillips, Claire/0000-0001-9072-6806",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,NOV,2011,17,11,,,,,3263,3273,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02483.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02483.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000296137000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Philip",,,Diurnal Temperature Range and Chikungunya Virus Infection in Invasive Mosquito Vectors,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Climate strongly influences the geographic distribution and timing of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. Environmental temperature affects phenotypic traits of mosquitoes including vector competence for arboviruses mediated by changes in infection, extrinsic incubation period and in rates of transmission. Most experiments, however, are done at constant temperatures. In nature, mosquitoes are more likely to experience daily fluctuations in temperature. Here we compare disseminated infection (leg infection) and saliva infection of Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) from Florida following oral exposure to an Asian genotype of chikungunya virus emergent in the Americas. We evaluated experimentally the effect of variable temperature regimens on disseminated infection and saliva infection of these Aedes species. Each of three temperature regimes had approximately the same average temperature (27-28 degrees C), but differed in the magnitude of the diurnal temperature range (DTR). The large DTR was 8.0 degrees C (range 23-31 degrees C) and the small DTR was 4.0 degrees C (range 26-30 degrees C) which approximate ranges in different locations of Florida during July-October when risk of transmission is highest. The constant temperature was set at 27 degrees C. Testing three geographic populations of each mosquito species, significant effects on disseminated infection were detected for an interaction between temperature regime and geographic population for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. There were no significant treatment effects of temperature, geographic population, or temperature by geographic population interaction on saliva infection for either mosquito species. Constant temperature resulted in a higher viral load in the saliva of Ae. albopictus, but not Ae. aegypti, compared to conditions where the temperature fluctuated.",,,,,"Zirbel Yanchula, Kylie/N-6835-2015","Zirbel Yanchula, Kylie/0000-0001-7673-2580",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2585,1938-2928,,,,JAN,2018,55,1,,,,,217,224,,10.1093/jme/tjx182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjx182,,,,,,,,29040730,,,,,WOS:000422975600023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Predictions of insect developmental rates using degree-days (thermal unit accumulations above the developmental base threshold of the insect) are based on daily mean temperatures, regardless of DTR. However, non-linearity and variance in the means and extremes are often ignored. The role of thermal variance (e. g., daily temperature extremes and DTR) was evaluated experimentally for two swallowtail butterfly sister species using a common day/night photoperiod of 18 : 6 h photo : scoto-phase and corresponding daytime thermophase and nighttime cryophase periods of 22 : 22 degrees C (constant 22 degrees C), 24 : 16 degrees C, and 26 : 10 degrees C (all three treatments had the same daily mean and the same degree-day accumulations). Although developmental rates of post-diapause pupae were largely unaffected for both species, our results show that sizes in P. canadensis females (but not males) were smaller in the treatments with more variance (26 degrees C : 10 degrees C) compared to constant 22 degrees C.

A large diurnal temperature range (DTR) (approximate to 18 degrees C daily swing) extended immature development time (> 1 d), lowered larval survival (approximate to 6%), and reduced adult female reproductive output by 25% 14 d after blood feeding, relative to the constant 26 degrees C temperature. A small DTR (approximate to 8 degrees C daily swing) led to a negligible or slightly positive effect on the life history traits tested.

Diurnal temperature ranges were set at 5, 10 and 15 degrees C with the same daily mean temperature and accumulated growing degree days (GDDa), under a parabolic STP. Seasonal temperature patterns were set following parabolic, anti-parabolic and quasi-horizontal configurations with DIF set at 10 degrees C. The results showed that DIF or cultivar had a significant influence on the biomass, plant height (PH), stem diameter (SD), length of technical stem (LTS), weight of technical stem (WTS), fibre weight (FW), fibre content (FC) and seed weight per pot (SWp). Seasonal temperature pattern also had a significant influence on these traits except for WTS and FW. Significant interactions were observed between DIF and cultivar, affecting all traits with the exception of FW, and between STP and cultivar, affecting biomass, PH, SD and WTS. Diurnal temperature range set at 10 degrees C was optimal for biomass, PH, SD, LTS, WTS, and FW, while DIF set at 5 degrees C benefited FC and SWp. Among the different SIP configurations, anti-parabolic pattern was optimal for biomass, PH, SD, LTS and FC, and the quasi-horizontal pattern best fit SWp.

Greater understanding of the environmental cues that regulate tuber sprouting may assist in improved nutsedge management. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of diurnal temperature variation on sprouting of purple nutsedge tubers. Two temperature regimes were evaluated: the first averaged 28 C, with daily fluctuations ranging from 0 to 19.5 C; the second temperature regime averaged 16 C, with daily fluctuations ranging from 0 to 18.5 C. When average temperature was 28 C, cumulative tuber sprouting ranged from 88 to 92%, with no detectable differences among diurnal fluctuations. The high average temperature in the first study may have negated any type of enforced sprouting suppression. However, when average temperature was lowered to 16 C (simulating early spring diurnal fluctuations under polyethylene mulch), there was a positive linear correlation between maximum tuber sprouting and temperature variation. With an average temperature of 16 C, the absence of temperature variation resulted in 52% purple nutsedge sprouting, while 87% sprouting occurred when daily temperature varied 18.5 C at the same average temperature. The use of various types of mulching material can affect average soil temperatures and diurnal variations, potentially shifting nutsedge emergence.

In a 4-month laboratory experiment, effects of the epigeic earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra on a succession of nematode community in litter of a mid-European birch/oak forest were tested in the gradient of an increase of diurnal temperature fluctuations from 0 degrees C (constant 15 degrees C; T(15)) to 10 degrees C (daily range between 10 degrees and 20 degrees C; T(10-20)) and 20 degrees C (daily range between 5 degrees and 25 degrees C; T(5-25)). Earthworm and temperature effects were measured as differences in nematode community respiration rates between the experimental treatments. Nematode respiration rates were calculated on the basis of body size/weight/O(2) consumption relationships for individual species. Nematode community was dominated by bacterial feeders and changed in a characteristic successional pattern which, however, was markedly modified by temperature regime and earthworm activities. Dominant nematode taxa revealed specific patterns of temporal dynamics in connection with their responses to temperature and earthworm presence. Thus, metabolic activity of Plectus acuminatus was strongly reduced by D. octaedra but did not react to variation of temperature regime. In contrast, activity of Panagrolaimus sp. significantly responded to temperature but not to earthworm presence, whereas Pl. thornei reacted to both factors separately and in combination. Ceratoplectus armatus was stronger affected by earthworm presence then by temperature; Tylocephalus auriculatus showed the opposite pattern. The variety of responses may explain the coexistence of several taxonomically related (Plectidae) and trophically similar species within the dominant group. Both earthworm presence and increase of the range of diurnal temperature fluctuations strongly affected the net of interspecific correlations within the nematode community. Earthworms strongly reduced total activities of nematode community at any temperature regime. T(15) regime showed markedly lower level of cumulative nematode respiration than both fluctuating regimes, irrespective of earthworm presence. In conclusion, combined effects of earthworms and temperature regime drastically changed patterns of relationships within the nematode litter community. The results of the experiments may have implications for the perspectives of global warming events at the study site: it is suggested that the ultimate vector of the changes in litter environment might be directed towards the conditions of the treatment [T(15) regime; earthworms present], with the corresponding trends in the development of the litter nematode community.",,,,,"Uvarov, Alexei/AAE-5342-2022; Kolosova, Nataliya G/AAR-7409-2020","Kolosova, Nataliya G/0000-0003-2398-8544",,,,,,,,,,,,,1505-2249,,,,,,2009,57,4,,,,,685,696,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000273093000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

All measured traits showed obvious DIF and varietal differences except the length of fiber bundle (LFB) and the inter-fiber bundle distance (IFBD). Significant interactions of DIF and cultivar were observed to affect the width of fiber bundle (WFB), the size of fiber cell (SFC), the size of fiber cell cavity (SFCC) and the thickness of fiber cell wall (TFCW). Compared with other DIFs, the number of fiber cells per bundle (NFCB) and WFB increased, but IFBD decreased under DIF 5. However, WFB, TFCW and NFCB all decreased under DIF 10. Under DIF 15 condition, both SFC and SFCC increased. For 'Ariane', IFBD was short under DIF 5, but SFC and SFCC were both large under DIF 10. For ` Argos', IFBD was also short under DIF 5.

Using mortality data with high temporal resolution of zebra finches living in large outdoor aviaries (5 years, 359.220 bird-days), we show that mortality rate increases almost two-fold per 1 degrees C increase in diurnal temperature range (DTR). Interestingly, the DTR effect differed between two groups with low versus high experimentally manipulated foraging costs, reflecting a typical laboratory 'easy' foraging environment and a 'hard' semi-natural environment respectively. DTR increased mortality on days with low minimum temperature in the easy foraging environment, but on days with high minimum temperature in the semi-natural environment. Thus, in a natural environment DTR effects will become increasingly important in a warming world, something not detectable in an 'easy' laboratory environment. These effects were particularly apparent at young ages. Critical time window analyses showed that the effect of DTR on mortality is delayed up to three months, while effects of minimum temperature occurred within a week.

Photosynthetic activity of small stands of Lolium perenne was continuously studied for up to two weeks under low photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the air temperature range from -3 degrees C to +9 degrees C. The photosynthetic rate of plants growing at 2, 6 and 9 degrees C was similar at 120 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD but the rate increased with increasing PPFD at all temperatures, particularly 9 degrees C. Light saturation of photosynthesis was reached at approx. 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 2 and 6 degrees C, and at approx. 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 9 degrees C. At 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), the CO2 exchange rate (CER) at 2 degrees C was approx. 60% of that at 9 degrees C. When the temperature increased gradually from 0 degrees C at start to +5 degrees C at the end of the 8-h photoperiod, CER decreased by about 20% compared with that at constant 5 degrees C. Changing the temperature from constant +5 degrees C to a diurnal variation between -2 and +2 degrees C gradually decreased daytime CER to approx. 10% after five days, partly due to leaf area losses (similar to 50% loss) when the poorly acclimatised plants were exposed to frost. At start of the photoperiod at -2 degrees C CER was negative, but became slightly positive when temperature exceeded -1 degrees C after two hours. Total daily photosynthesis was negative due to night-time respiration in this treatment. Soil heating to avoid freezing when the diurnal air temperature fluctuated between -3 and +3 degrees C had no effect on CER at this low PPFD level (150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). In contrast to the -2/+2 degrees C treatment, total daily photosynthesis was slightly positive in the -3/+3 degrees C treatment, where the plants were better acclimatised to frost. Increasing the CO2 concentration from 350 to 600 mu mol mol(-1) had no effect on CER at 2 and 6 degrees C, but increased it by 20% at 9 degrees C. The data indicate that the minimum temperature for photosynthesis in the cultivar studied is about -4 degrees C. The results can be applied in different photosynthesis models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The surface-atmosphere interactions are investigated based on single-column simulations of the DIurnal land-atmosphere Coupling Experiment and on global simulations. Low values of the surface thermal inertia increase the diurnal temperature range (DTR) and the daytime turbulent heat fluxes. The diurnal response of surface temperature to the thermal inertia is asymmetric between daytime and nighttime, inducing a change in the daily mean surface temperature that can reach several degrees over large areas. This asymmetrical response to thermal inertia is shown to be due to the diurnal contrast of the stability state of the atmospheric boundary layer.

Sporadic spatial distribution of weather stations causes a low spatial resolution of measured air temperatures. This study focused on modeling the air diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) based on the land surface temperature (LST) DTC. The air DTC model parameters were estimated from LST DTC model parameters by a regression analysis. Here, the LST obtained from the INSAT-3D geostationary satellite and the air temperature extracted from weather stations were used within the time frame of 4 March 2015 to 22 May 2017 across Iran. Constant parameters of the air DTC model for each weather station were estimated based on an experimental approach over the time period. Results showed these parameters decrease as elevation increases. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) for three hours sampling were calculated. The MAE and RMSE ranges were between [0.1, 4] degrees C and [0.1, 3.3] degrees C, respectively. Additionally, 95% of MAEs and RMSEs were less than 2.9 degrees C and 2.4 degrees C values, correspondingly. The range of the mean values of MAEs and RMSEs for a three-hour sampling time were [-0.29, 0.6] degrees C and [2, 2.11] degrees C. The DTC model results showed a meaningful statistical fitting in both air DTCs modeled from LST and weather station-based DTCs. The variability of mean error and RMSE in different land covers and elevation classes were also investigated.

The open grassland field site in SE Australia was characterized by large seasonal and diurnal changes in air temperature. On each measurement day, leaf respiration rates in darkness were measured in situ at 2-3 h intervals over a 24 h period, with measurements being conducted at the ambient leaf temperature. The rate of respiration at a set measuring temperature (i.e. apparent 'respiratory capacity') was greater in seedlings grown under low average daily temperatures (i.e. acclimation occurred), both in the field and under controlled-environment conditions. The sensitivity of leaf respiration to diurnal changes in temperature (i.e. the Q(10) of leaf respiration) exhibited little seasonal variation over much of the year. However, Q(10) values were significantly greater on cold winter days (i.e. when daily average and minimum air temperatures were below 6 degrees and -1 degrees C, respectively). These differences in Q(10) values were not due to bias arizing from the contrasting daily temperature amplitudes in winter and summer, as the Q(10) of leaf respiration was constant over a wide temperature range in short-term experiments. Due to the higher Q(10) values in winter, there was less difference between winter and summer leaf respiration rates measured at 5 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. The net result of these changes was that there was relatively little difference in total daily leaf respiratory CO2 release per unit leaf dry mass in winter and summer. Under controlled-environment conditions, acclimation of respiration to growth temperature occurred in as little as 1-3 d. Acclimation was associated with a change in the concentration of soluble sugars under controlled conditions, but not in the field. Our data suggest that acclimation in the field may be associated with the onset of cold-induced photo-inhibition. We conclude that cold-acclimation of dark respiration in snow gum leaves is characterized by changes in both the temperature sensitivity and apparent 'capacity' of the respiratory apparatus, and that such changes will have an important impact on the carbon economy of snow gum plants.",,,,,"Ball, Marilyn/D-1180-2009; Atkin, Owen K/C-8415-2009; Atkin, Owen/O-2671-2019","Ball, Marilyn/0000-0001-9170-940X; Atkin, Owen K/0000-0003-1041-5202; Atkin, Owen/0000-0003-1041-5202",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-7791,1365-3040,,,,JAN,2000,23,1,,,,,15,26,,10.1046/j.1365-3040.2000.00511.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2000.00511.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000085589500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Measurements of soil CO2 flux were made by the open-flow IRGA method. Temperature and ambient CO2 concentration, which are highly variable in time, were also monitored during the measurements. The Soil CO2 flux showed significant diurnal changes, and these patterns were highly correlated with the soil surface temperatures. The measured values ranged from 2.52 x 10(-2) to 8.54 x 10(-2) Mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in August and from -4.95 x 10(-3) to 1.13 x 10(-2) mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in February. Moreover, a negative linear relationship between soil CO2 flux and ambient CO2 concentration was found in diurnal fluctuations. To explore the mechanism of these daily cycles, we estimated Soil CO2 flux with a coupled model of soil microbial activity and gas diffusion. The parameter functions used in our calculation were obtained based on the measured values during the same time of soil respiration measurements. The soil CO2 production rates were obtained by laboratory experiments using the undisturbed soil core samples, which were taken from the field measuring soil respiration. The calculated soil CO2 flux ranged from 4.41 x 10(-2) to 7.78 x 10(-2) Mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in August and 1.14 x 10(-3) to 5.03 x 10(-3) mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in February. These patterns of diurnal variability were similar for the measured ones, and the daily amounts estimated by integrating the model outputs were almost equal to those from the measured values. However, the amplitude of the measured respiration rates was larger than that of the estimated ones. The differences between measured and estimated values were related with thermal gradient around soil surface. The calculation suggested that the soil horizon above 10 cm depth would be a major CO2 source of soil respiration at about 70% in August and 40% in February. The depth of soil horizon in which soil microbial activity was significantly higher was not settled and would have a seasonal variation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A germination experiment in darkness and light at different temperature regimes showed that P. australis germinated as well in darkness as in light over most of the temperature regimes tested. The germination requirements could partly explain why this species, despite a large annual production of small seeds, does not accumulate a persistent soil seed bank. A second experiment examined the effect of one to four diurnal temperature cycles with amplitude of fluctuations ranging from 0 to 30 degrees C; diurnal mean temperature of 15 degrees C. Germination in the absence of fluctuations was low, and logistic model estimates showed a positive effect of number of temperature cycles which was strongly influenced by amplitude size. For seeds that have fallen on moist ground during the winter, these laboratory results predict that a few large diurnal temperature fluctuations could be sufficient for onset of germination in the subsequently warmer spring period. Seeds that are located under water, however, are predicted to remain ungerminated until the water level falls. Hence, we suggest that the requirement for fluctuating temperature, in addition to being a sensor for 'exposed' seed sites, is also effectively acting as a germination timing mechanism.",,,,,"Per, Milberg/C-2618-2009; Milberg, Per/G-6153-2012","Milberg, Per/0000-0001-6128-1051",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-2585,,,,,JUN,1999,9,2,,,,,165,170,,10.1017/S0960258599000185,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0960258599000185,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081181400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the thermophile cucumber is known to be very sensitive to low temperatures. In particular, fruit growth decreases considerably as temperature declines. Nevertheless, reports show that cucumber can be grown successfully at low night temperatures. To explain this phenomenon, it is necessary to investigate the effect of the diurnal temperature variation on fruit growth. Fruit-bearing cucumber plants were grown in two experiments, either at a constant low temperature during the light and dark phase of 15 or 16 degrees C or at an extremely low temperature during the dark phase of 10 or 11 degrees C with an increase to 24 or 25 degrees C during the middle of the light phase resulting in a daily average of 15 or 16 degrees C, respectively. Introducing the diurnal temperature variation considerably increased fruit growth compared with cultivation at a constant temperature. The vegetative dry matter, however, was greater at a constant than at variable temperatures. Therefore, the total dry matter appeared to be unaffected by the treatments, meaning that photosynthesis was unaffected. Model calculations indicate that the relationship between temperature and fruit growth is not linear in the low-temperature range. For practical applications, it can be concluded that short daily periods with high temperature can mitigate the negative effect of low night temperature on fruit growth and yield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-5345,2327-9834,,,,JAN,2017,52,1,,,,,60,64,,10.21273/HORTSCI11215-16,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI11215-16,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000396526400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Geographic variation among populations in life history response to temperature mean and variability offers one view of the potential for local adaptation to broaden the thermal niche. We used laboratory growth experiments to examine the effects of temperatures between 13 degrees C and 30 degrees C on five life history traits and the intrinsic rate of increase for 15 Tigriopus californicus populations distributed over 17 degrees of latitude. Different life history stages showed distinct latitudinal shifts in thermal response, while the temperature of peak population growth consistently declined with increasing latitude. In addition, high-latitude populations grew faster at optimal temperatures but showed steeper fitness declines at high temperature. To test geographic population variation in response to the amplitude of daily thermal fluctuations, we grew three northern and three southern populations and manipulated nightly low and daily high temperatures. We found the lowest fitness overall in the treatment with the highest mean temperature, and the treatment with the greatest variability showed high fitness despite an 8 degrees C greater daily range. Population responses to daily thermal variability were unrelated to latitude of origin. Our results indicate that trade-offs between adaptation to high vs. low temperature, and between growth and maturation vs. survival and fecundity, govern local adaptation along the latitudinal gradient. They also indicate that T. californicus populations can maintain fitness over a wide range of daily variability but are more sensitive to small changes in the mean temperature.",,,,,,"Shurin, Jonathan/0000-0001-7870-1972",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,SEP,2015,96,9,,,,,2348,2359,,10.1890/14-1695.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/14-1695.1,,,,,,,,26594693,,,,,WOS:000361152100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thermal-response models of this type have not been validated under simulated field-variable temperature conditions that vary in diurnal pattern, diurnal range and longer-term trends in mean-daily temperature. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate germination response of thickspike wheatgrass (Elymus lanceolatus), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pscudoroegneria spicata), Sandberg bluegrass (Poa sandbergii) and bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) under both constant and field-variable temperature regimes in the laboratory. It was hypothesized that the thermal history assumption was valid and that constant-temperature data could be used to accurately estimate field-variable temperature response. Seeds were germinated at seven constant temperatures between 5 and 35 degrees C, and under 18 variable-temperature regimes simulating six planting dates at three field sites. Predictions of germination time under variable-temperature conditions were accurate to within a fraction of 1 day up to a cumulative germination percentage of 70% for thickspike wheatgrass, 60% for bluebunch wheatgrass, 55% for Sandberg bluegrass and 70% for bottlebrush squirreltail.

Temperatures can also fluctuate rapidly, reaching values not revealed by climate data. Such fine-scale variation raises challenges for modelling species distributions under changing climates. To avoid misunderstanding current species distributions and future changes, temperatures must be modelled at high resolutions. Most existing methods either require extensive parameterization or are pre-parameterized for restricted localities and current conditions; here, we describe a more versatile method intended for European landscapes under a wide range of scenarios. The availability of high-resolution topographic data makes possible the use of projected solar irradiation to help predict local diurnal ground temperatures. Using time series from 83 points across Europe, we fitted statistical models for soil surface temperature based on geographical characteristics of the sites along with atmospheric variables obtained from a publicly available data base. The sites ranged from 40 degrees N to 60 degrees N and 2 degrees W to 25 degrees E, and from 43 to 1500m in elevation. We compare models for monthly mean and daily afternoon temperatures, for open and tree-covered habitats. The effect of topography was greatest for the daily predictions, and generally more important in open than in tree-covered sites. Tests with data collected from other European locations in a different time period suggest that our models can predict monthly means with an error standard deviation of about 2.3 degrees C. We provide an R function that implements our models on the basis of readily available data. Our mean-temperatures model should be useful for understanding organisms' niches, dispersal possibilities and community dynamics, and for predicting species' refugia, range shifts and opportunities for adaptation under projected climate change.",,,,,"Gunton, Richard/AAW-6382-2021","Gunton, Richard/0000-0002-7213-787X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,MAY,2015,6,5,,,,,532,542,,10.1111/2041-210X.12355,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12355,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000354540700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

While feeding high-energy grain-based diets is advantageous for growth and performance, it can also contribute to an increased likelihood of metabolic issues. Different feedstuffs have unique digestive utilization, which may lead to different cattle performance outcomes. Barley is fermented to a greater extent in the rumen, compared to corn, and can lead to an increased likelihood of digestive disorders. To further our understanding of the use of barley and corn in cattle feedlot diets, we evaluated the effect of diets on ruminal pH, temperature and feed intake events using continuous rumen monitoring technology. While mean ruminal pH was not different between corn or barley-fed steers, barley-fed steers had greater ruminal pH change throughout a 24 h period. Barley-fed steers also exhibited greater variation in ruminal pH. Additionally, intake patterns were different between corn- and barley-fed steers in which corn-fed steers consumed more feed the first 6 h directly after feeding while barley-fed steers consumed more feed later in the day. Presumably these intake patterns could be influenced by differences in the diurnal patterns of ruminal pH between corn and barley. By evaluating ruminal dynamics on a diurnal scale, we will enhance our understanding of utilization of different feedstuffs in beef feedlot diets. This study evaluated the effects of corn or barley finishing diets on ruminal pH and temperature and their relationship to feed intake events using continuous reticulorumen monitoring of feedlot steers. Average daily ruminal pH and temperature were not impacted (p >= 0.17) by diet. However, diet did affect daily variation of ruminal pH and temperature (p < 0.01). Average hourly ruminal pH displayed a diet by hour post-feeding interaction (p < 0.01), where barley-fed steers had greater (p < 0.01) ruminal pH than corn-fed steers at 0, 1, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 h post feeding, but had lower (p <= 0.05) ruminal pH than corn-fed steers at 6, 7, and 8 h post-feeding. Variation in ruminal pH hour post-feeding also displayed a diet by hour post-feeding interaction (p < 0.01), where barley-fed steers had greater (p <= 0.03) variation in ruminal pH at hours 1-17 post-feeding but did not differ (p >= 0.16) at 0, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 h post-feeding.

However, under high temperature conditions during the summer, especially in the southeastern United States, some mulches warm the soil to temperatures that might be deleterious to plant growth. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plants grown in the field were exposed to a range of root-zone temperatures (RZTs), resulting from growing the plants in different seasons and by using colored mulches that differed in their soil-warming ability. The objective was to determine the relationship of mean seasonal RZT, as affected by different colored plastic film mulches, with plant growth and fruit yield. The study consisted of experiments carried out in three seasons: Fall 1999 (five mulches, one cultivar), Spring 2000 (eight mulches and three cultivars), and Fall 2000 (four mulches and three cultivars). Treatments were black (n = 2), gray, red, silver (n = 3), and white (n = 2) mulches, and bare soil. Over the season, mean RZT decreased in the fall (from 32 to 24 degreesC) and increased in the spring (from 20 to 29 degreesC). Daily mean values of RZT over the season under plastic mulches were higher (1 to 5 degreesC) than those of air temperature. The highest RZT at midday occurred under black mulch, and the lowest under bare soil and white mulch. Bare soil showed the largest diurnal RZT fluctuation. RZT at midday was up to 4 degreesC higher under black or gray mulch compared to the other mulches or bare soil. The degree of soil warming was correlated with reflectivity of the mulch. Black mulch had the lowest light reflectance [10% photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)] while silver mulch had the highest (55% PAR). There were, however, differences in reflectance among mulches of the same color depending on the manufacturer. RZT affected vegetative top fresh weight (FW), fruit yield, fruit number, and individual fruit FW. All these growth attributes fitted a quadratic relationship with mean RZT for the season, with an optimal that ranged between 25.4 and 26.3 degreesC. The effects of colored mulches on plant response depended on the impact of the mulch on RZT.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we designed experimental investigations by adding heat-protecting layers to the trunks of Pinus massoniana Lamb. to lower DTRs and simulate the environmental conditions underground in the Fuzhou area of humid subtropical China (HSC).

This paper proposed an improved heat-conduction-equation (HCE) method to reconstruct soil thermal field using two-depth measurements of soil temperature. The revised HCE method employed a direct approach as well as an indirect approach to estimate both the daily average soil temperature (DST) and the instantaneous soil temperature (IST), during which the annual temperature cycle and the diurnal temperature cycle are combined. Two validation experiments (i.e., Test-1 and Test-2) were performed with soil temperature measurements at five stations chosen from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). The results show that the revised HCE method improves the accuracy of modeling soil thermal field in comparison to its traditional form. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the ISTs estimated by the traditional HCE method range from 1.0 to 2.1 degrees C (2.4 to 4.8 degrees C) in Test-1 (Test-2); while the errors of the revised HCE method by the indirect approach are reduced to less than 1.0 degrees C in both Test-1 and Test-2; the errors by the direct approach are further reduced to less than 0.7 degrees C in both Test-1 and Test-2.

Using SST diurnal variations (DeltaSSTgms) derived from the hourly VISSR SSTs and insolation, and the wind velocity derived from the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite/NASA Scatterometer (ADEOS/NSCAT), it is verified that the SST warming occurs under conditions of high insolation and weak wind. To investigate the DeltaSSTgms, two simple models are applied. One SST diurnal warming estimation model (Model A) is developed with reference to Price et al. [1986, 1987] introducing the latitudinal heat loss estimated from climatic values. Another model (Model B) was proposed by Webster et al. [1996]. Because SST diurnal warming is dependent on meteorological conditions, the areas of SST warming change from day to day. However, areas of weak wind and high insolation can be specified by large-scale atmospheric systems.

Large SST diurnal warming has occurred at middle latitudes in the summer hemisphere and tropical regions near the land.

The snowmelt schemes have been tested with a point measurement dataset at the Cotton Creek Experimental Watershed (CCEW) in British Columbia, Canada and with a detailed dataset available from the Dranse de Ferret catchment, an extensively monitored catchment in the Swiss Alps. The snowmelt model performance is quantified with the use of a spatially-explicit model of the hydrologic response. Comparative analyses are presented with the widely-known, grid-based method proposed by Hock which combines a local, temperature-index approach with potential radiation. The results suggest that a simple diurnal cycle of the degree-day melt parameter based on minimum and maximum temperatures is competitive with the Hock approach for sub-daily melt simulations. Advantages of the new extension of the classical degree-day method over other temperature-index methods include its use of physically-based, diurnal variations and its ability to be adapted to data-constrained hydrological models which are lumped in some nature.

Because temperature shows pronounced natural daily fluctuations, we examined if experiments based on a constant temperature range can mask the real effects of the thermal regime on host-parasitoid interactions. The effects of two fluctuating thermal regimes on several developmental parameters of the Drosophila larval parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi were analyzed in this study. Regime 1 included a range of 16-23-16 degrees C and regime 2 included a range of 16-21-26-21-16 degrees C (mean temperature 20.1 degrees C) compared to a 20.1 degrees C constant temperature. Under an average temperature of 20.1 degrees C, which corresponds to a cold condition of L. boulardi development, we showed that the success of parasitism is significantly higher under a fluctuating temperature regime than at constant temperature. A fluctuating regime also correlated with a reduced development time of the parasitoids. In contrast, the thermal regime did not affect the ability of Drosophila to resist parasitoid infestation. Finally, we demonstrated that daily temperature fluctuation prevented the entry into diapause for this species, which is normally observed at a constant temperature of 21 degrees C. Overall, the results reveal that constant temperature experiments can produce misleading results, highlighting the need to study the thermal biology of organisms under fluctuating regimes that reflect natural conditions as closely as possible. This is particularly a major issue in host-parasitoid associations, which constitute a good model to understand the effect of climate warming on interacting species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this research was to study the impact of three daily variable thermal environments (with maximum experimental temperatures between 10:00 and 16:00 hours), on the survival, developmental time and body size of metamorphs of four tropical anuran species from lowland habitats in Colombia. A total of 50 embryos (Gosner stage ten) to metamorphosis (Gosner stage 46) of Rhinella humboldti, Hypsiboas crepitans and Engystomops pustulosus were exposed to each one of the three daily variable temperature treatments: high temperature (mean = 27.5(circle)C; maximum temperature = 34 +/- 1(circle)C; range = 23-35(circle)C), medium temperature (25.5(circle)C; 29 +/- 1(circle)C; 23-30(circle)C), and low temperature (24(circle)C; 24 +/- 1(circle)C; 23-25(circle)C).

For all species, the thermal variable environment with the highest temperature showed the greatest accumulated survival, reduced significantly the developmental time from embryos to metamorphs, and the snout-vent-length of metamorphs. Therefore, under field conditions where ponds are exposed to thermally variable environments, the highest temperatures may promote a decrease in the period of time to metamorphosis, and a positive increase for the anuran survival; nevertheless, extreme temperatures were also found in the microhabitat of the species studied, higher than their upper thermal limits reported, which suggest a vulnerable situation for them and other tropical anurans from similar habitats.",,,,,,"Bernal, Manuel Hernando/0000-0003-0940-4514",,,,,,,,,,,,,0034-7744,2215-2075,,,,MAR,2017,65,1,,,,,55,63,,,,,,,,,,,29465973,,,,,WOS:000397173700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we investigated the photosynthetic responses of two local dominant wetland plants to two simulated air-warming scenarios (+2 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees C and +3.5 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees C) by using open-top chambers in the northwest Yunnan plateau. During the growing season from 2014 to 2016, we explored photosynthetic parameters and the relationships linking photosynthesis to temperature variations. We found that open-top chambers had increased the daily maximum temperature as well as DTRs. The photosynthetic responses of two plant species to warming were species-specific during the first two years but species-independent in the third year. The two warming scenarios did not significantly alter the linear relationships linking maximum net photosynthetic rate (A(max)) to stomatal conductance (g(s)), intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i), and transpiration rate (T-r), despite changes in slopes and intercepts of the fitted lines. The DTRs between 0 degrees C and 30 degrees C were positively correlated with photosynthesis, while DTRs over 30 degrees C were negatively correlated with photosynthesis.

Soil thermal conductivity, reflectance, and temperature at a 5-cm depth were measured and monitored in an experimental field using a portable soil thermal property analyzer, a portable full-range spectrometer, and temperature and water potential probes. The field was located in the North China Plain and had been cropped in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) system for 5 yr.

Soil water potential slightly increased under B4.5 treatment but decreased under B9.0 treatment relative to the control. Reflectance increased in the near-ultraviolet and blue-light wavelengths (350-513 nm) and decreased in the infrared wavelength range (520-2350 nm) with biochar amendment. Biochar amendment reduced diurnal soil-temperature fluctuations on both daily and seasonal scales, although the annual average daily soil temperatures at a 5-cm depth showed no significant difference among treatments. Comparison with the control showed that biochar treatment moderated soil temperature extremes, lowering the temperature when soil temperature was high and raising it when soil temperature was low. This moderating capability was mostly within +/- 0.4 and +/- 0.8 degrees C for mean daily temperature and mean diurnal temperature of soil, respectively.

Therefore, the building DTRa is supposed to be higher than that of parks due to its building fabric. However, we found an opposite phenomenon (smaller building DTRa than that of parks), and the underlying mechanisms explaining this phenomenon are unclear. Here we conducted, in Beijing (China), a long-term observational campaign of standard meteorological variables and radiation/energy fluxes to provide a new valuable evidence (a part of external energy) to explain this phenomenon. The observations indicated external heat energies from horizontal advection and anthropogenic heat sources. We found a significantly lower building DTRa than that of parks (Delta DTRa = 2.53 +/- 1.93 degrees C), with a maximum difference of 3.54 +/- 1.96 degrees C in autumn; which was mainly attributed to higher daily minimum air temperature. We also found the large differences in air temperature contribution between the buildings and the parks happened mainly at night. The external heat sources of the building contributed 16.71% to the nighttime air temperature, which was higher than that of the parks (8.39%).

Land Surface Temperature (LST) products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are widely used to estimate Ta. Previous studies of these products in Ta estimation, however, were generally applied in small areas and with a small number of meteorological stations. This study designed both temporal and spatial experiments to estimate 8-day and daily maximum and minimum Ta (Tmax and Tmin) on three spatial scales: climate zone, continental and global scales from 2009 to 2018, using the Random Forest (RF) method based on MODIS LST products and other auxiliary data. Factors contributing to the relation between LST and Ta were determined based on physical models and equations. Temporal and spatial experiments were defined by the rules of dividing the training and validation datasets for the RF method, in which the stations selected in the training dataset were all included or not in the validation dataset. The RF model was first trained and validated on each spatial scale, respectively. On a global scale, model accuracy with a determination coefficient (R-2) > 0.96 and root mean square error (RMSE) < 1.96 degrees C and R-2 > 0.95 and RMSE < 2.55 degrees C was achieved for 8-day and daily Ta estimations, respectively, in both temporal and spatial experiments. Then the model was trained and cross-validated on each spatial scale. The results showed that the data size and station distribution of the study area were the main factors influencing the model performance at different spatial scales. Finally, the spatial patterns of the model performance and variable importance were analyzed. Both daytime and nighttime LST had a significant contribution in the 8-day Tmax estimation on all the three spatial scales; while their contribution in daily Tmax estimation varied over different continents or climate zones. This study was expected to improve our understanding of Ta estimation in terms of accuracy variations and influencing variables on different spatial and temporal scales.

To gain a better understanding of water temperature regimes experienced by embryo and larvae among populations, we surveyed surface and intragravel temperatures at 10 locations where Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) spawn across British Columbia from mid-November to May. We chose coastal systems and interior systems at southern and northern latitudes to represent the range of potential conditions where fish spawn. Intragravel water temperatures varied significantly across study sites and were also significantly warmer than surface water temperatures - particularly during the coldest winter months. Northern interior populations experienced temperatures below 1 degrees C early in embryo development; less than a month after spawning and with fewer than 50 accumulated thermal units in some locations. Throughout the experimental period, temperature variability was less in intragravel water than surface water, but differences also existed among locations. Daily fluctuations in temperature were greatest for the southern-most coastal locations. Our results represent important findings when attempting to extrapolate incubation temperature from surface water temperature since even small differences in temperature have a cumulative effect in embryo and larval development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1909,1573-5133,,,,JUL,2019,102,7,,,,,955,967,,10.1007/s10641-019-00882-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-019-00882-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000470789600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The short yet high soil temperatures experienced due to passage of fire are conflated with the lower, but longer, temperatures experienced by daily fluctuations which occur after removing vegetation. These germination cues are able to break seed dormancy, but it is difficult to assess their specific level of influence because they occur consecutively after summer fires, just before the flush of germination in the wet season (autumn). By applying experimental fires, seed treatments were imposed that combined fire exposure/non-fire exposure with exposure to microhabitats under a gradient of disturbance (i.e. gaps opened by fire, mechanical brushing and intact vegetation). The seeds used were representative of the main families of obligate seeders (Ulex parviflorus, Cistus albidus and Rosmarinus officinalis). Specifically, an assessment was made of (1) the proportion of seeds killed by fire, (2) seedling emergence under field conditions and (3) seeds which remained ungerminated in soil. For the three species studied, the factors that most influenced seedling emergence and seeds remaining ungerminated were microhabitats with higher temperature fluctuations after fire (gaps opened by fire and brushing treatments). The direct effect of fire decreased the seedling emergence of U. parviflorus and reduced the proportion of seeds of R. officinalis remaining ungerminated. The relevance of depleting vegetation (and subsequent daily temperature fluctuation in summer) suggests that studies focusing on lower temperature thresholds for breaking seed dormancy are required. This fact also supports the hypothesis that the seeding capacity in Mediterranean Basin obligate seeders may have evolved as a response to a wide range of disturbances, and not exclusively to fire.",,,,,"Baeza, Jaime/H-9145-2015; Baeza, M.Jaime/AAB-5997-2019; Santana, Victor M./J-2299-2014; Davo-Blanes, M Carmen/ABC-5041-2021","Baeza, Jaime/0000-0002-9739-0062; Baeza, M.Jaime/0000-0002-9739-0062; Santana, Victor M./0000-0002-6121-1747; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,JAN,2013,111,1,,,,,127,134,,10.1093/aob/mcs238,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs238,,,,,,,,23129044,,,,,WOS:000312653000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

An accurate predictor of calving would enable supervision of cows more precisely to a relevant time interval so that obstetrical assistance can be provided in a timely manner. This might help to decrease calf mortality rate. Evidence exists that cows exhibit a decrease in body temperature before the onset of calving. The performance of a decrease in body temperature as a test to predict the onset of calving in dairy cows has not been investigated. The objective was to investigate test criteria of a decrease in vaginal and rectal temperature as predictors of calving in dairy cows. In 3 experiments, temperature loggers (Minilog 8, Vemco Ltd., Halifax, Canada) were inserted into the vagina of cows before calving (n = 85), and rectal temperatures were measured twice daily in 55 of these cows. Vaginal temperatures were 0.2 to 0.3 degrees C and 0.6 to 0.7 degrees C lower on the day of calving compared with 24 and 48 h before calving, respectively. Rectal temperatures were 0.3 to 0.5 degrees C and 0.4 to 0.6 degrees C lower on the day of calving compared with 24 and 48 h before calving, respectively. Vaginal temperatures exhibited a diurnal rhythm during the 120 h before calving, which continued on a lower level during the 48 h preceding parturition. In the 3 experiments, a decrease in vaginal temperature of >= 0.3 degrees C over 24 h could predict calving within 24 h, with sensitivity ranging from 62 to 71% and specificity ranging from 81 to 87%. Similarly, a decrease in rectal temperature measured at 0730 h of >= 0.3 degrees C could predict calving within 24 h, with sensitivity from 44 to 69% and specificity from 86 to 88%. Although dairy cows exhibit a distinctive decrease in vaginal and rectal temperatures commencing approximately 48 h before calving, detecting this decrease does not determine the onset of calving precisely.

In experiment 1 (two groups), ambient temperature varied in a cyclic way from 22 to 12 degrees C and 12 to 22 degrees C with three or four consecutive days at each of the following temperatures: 22, 19, 16, 14 or 12 degrees C. Similarly, in experiment 2 (two groups), temperature varied from 19 to 29 degrees C and 29 to 19 degrees C with three or four consecutive days at 19, 22, 25, 27 or 29 degrees C. In both experiments, each group was used over two successive cycles with an initial body weight (BW) of 37 kg at cycle 1 (four pigs per group) and 63 kg at cycle 2 (three pigs per group). During experiment 3, groups of four pigs were exposed to varying temperatures over one cycle either as in experiment 1 (one group) or as in experiment 2 (one group); their initial BW was 45 kg. Photoperiod was fixed to 12 h of light. In experiments 1 and 2, neither the daily number of meals (II) nor the rate of feed intake (37 g/min) were affected by temperature. The daily number of meals was lower at cycle 2 (9 vs. 12 at cycle 1 on average) but their size was higher (305 vs. 181 g/meal at cycle 1). The feeding pattern was mainly diurnal (63%). From individual data obtained at each temperature level and each stage of growth in this study (N = 296), an equation to predict the voluntary feed intake (VFI) from temperature (T, ranging between 12 and 29 degrees C) and body weight (BW, ranging between 30 and 90 kg) is proposed: VFI (g/d) = - 1264 + 117T - 2.40T(2) + 73.6BW - 0.26BW(2) - 0.95T X BW (RSD = 329).

Twenty-nine experiments were selected that had compared different constant temperatures and that included 21degreesC within their range. Differences in egg production were expressed as a proportion of the treatment group given 21degreesC within that experiment. An exponential curve with the addition of a linear trend gave the best (P<0.001) description of egg numbers, weight and mass, feed intakes and egg composition variables.

In April and May 2007, experiments were completed to determine the effects of fluctuating temperature on Pocillopora meandrina and Porites rus, and consecutive trials were used to expose them for 13 days to 26 degrees C, 28 degrees C (ambient conditions), 30 degrees C, or a fluctuating treatment ranging from 26 to 30 degrees C over 24 h. The multivariate response was assessed using maximum dark-adapted quantum yield of PSII (F-V/F-M), Symbiodinium density, chlorophyll-a content, and calcification. In trial 1, multivariate physiology of both species was significantly affected by treatments, with the fluctuating temperature resulting in a 17-45% decline in Symbiodinium density (relative to the ambient) matching that occurring at a constant 30 degrees C; F-V/F-M, chlorophyll-a content, and calcification, did not differ between the fluctuating and the steady treatments. In contrast, in trial 2 that utilized corals collected two weeks after those used in trial 1, the corals were unaffected by the treatments, likely due to an environment x trial interaction caused by seasonal declines in Symbiodinium density. Together, these results demonstrate that short transgressions to ecologically relevant high and low temperatures can elicit a potentially detrimental response equivalent to that occurring upon exposure to a constant high temperature. The dissimilar responses among dependent variables and consecutive trials underscore the importance of temporal replication and multivariate approaches in coral ecophysiology. It is likely that recent history has a stronger effect on the response of corals to treatments than is currently recognized. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

By performing scaled outdoor measurements in summer of 2017 in Guangzhou, China, we investigate these impacts on spatial/temporal characteristics of urban thermal environment which are still unclear so far. Two types of street canyon models are investigated, i.e. the 'hollow' model resembling hollow concrete buildings and the 'sand' model consisting of buildings filled with sand attaining much greater thermal storage. For each model, three street aspect ratios (building height/street width, H/W = 1, 2, 3; H = 1.2 m) are considered. The diurnal variations of air-wall surface temperatures are observed and their characteristics are quantified for various cases. The daily average temperature and daily temperature range (DTR) of wall temperature vary significantly with different aspect ratios and thermal storage. During the daytime, wider street canyon (H/W = 1) with less shading area experiences higher temperature than narrower ones (H/W = 2, 3) as more solar radiation received by wall surfaces. At night, wider street canyon cools down quicker due to stronger upward long wave radiation and night ventilation. For hollow models, H/W = 1 attains DTR of 12.1 degrees C, which is 1.2 and 2.1 degrees C larger than that of H/W = 2, 3. Moreover, the sand models experience smaller DTR and a less changing rate of wall temperature than hollow models because larger thermal storage absorbs more heat in the daytime and releases more at night. DTR of hollow models with H/W = 1, 2, 3 is 4.5, 4.6 and 3.8 degrees C greater than sand models respectively. For both hollow and sand models, wider streets experience a little higher daily average temperature (0.3-0.6 degrees C) than narrower ones. Our study provides direct evidence in how man-made urban structures influence urban climate and also suggests the possibility to control outdoor thermal environment by optimize urban morphology and thermal storage.

Most laboratory studies that have characterized the influence of temperature on development in amphibians have failed to incorporate the realities of diel temperature fluctuations (DTF), which can be considerable for pond-breeding amphibians. Results: We evaluated the effects of different ecologically relevant ranges of DTF compared with effects of constant temperatures on development of embryos and larvae of the Korean fire-bellied toad (Bombina orientalis). We constructed thermal reaction norms for developmental stage, snout-vent length, and tail length by fitting a Gompertz-Gaussian function to measurements taken from embryos after 66 hours of development in 12 different constant temperature environments between 14 degrees C and 36 degrees C. We used these reaction norms as null models to test the hypothesis that developmental effects of DTF are more than the sum of average constant temperature effects over the distribution of temperatures experienced. We predicted from these models that growth and differentiation would be positively correlated with average temperature at low levels of DTF but not at higher levels of DTF. We tested our prediction in the laboratory by rearing B. orientalis embryos at three average temperatures (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 28 degrees C) and four levels of thermal variation (0 degrees C, 6 degrees C, 13 degrees C, and 20 degrees C). Several of the observed responses to DTF were significantly different from both predictions of the model and from responses in constant temperature treatments at the same average temperatures. At an average temperature of 24 degrees C, only the highest level of DTF affected differentiation and growth rates, but at both cooler and warmer average temperatures, moderate DTF was enough to slow developmental and tail growth rates. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that both the magnitude of DTF range and thermal averages need to be considered simultaneously when parsing the effects of changing thermal environments on complex developmental responses, particularly when they have potential functional and adaptive significance.",,,,,"Jukar, Advait/AAU-6165-2021","Jukar, Advait/0000-0002-1525-1246; Park, Daesik/0000-0001-9209-0493",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1472-6785,,,,MAY 4,2013,13,,,,,,,,18,10.1186/1472-6785-13-18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6785-13-18,,,,,,,,23641898,,,,,WOS:000318936400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Physical mechanisms are sought which could explain possible changes in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) under conditions of increased atmospheric greenhouse gas content. We show that an important contribution to changes in DTR is given by soil moisture.In areas where soil moisture increases due to an increase in precipitation there is a positive change in latent heat flux and a decrease in sensible heat flux.As a result, in areas with increasing soil moisture, the increase in maximum daytime temperature will be smaller than that in minimum temperature, thereby causing a decrease in the DTR. The opposite occurs for areas which undergo soil drying. This process amplifies the effect of cloud changes on surface solar and infrared radiation and dominates the direct effect of downward infrared radiation associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentration.

Models of rates of development at constant temperatures of an example insect are compared graphically with predicted rates under artificial and naturally varying temperature regimes. Acceleration of insect development at low temperatures and retardation at high temperatures are shown to be implicit to the assumption of nonlinearity of development. The influence of the diurnal range of the temperature regime on the rate summation effect and the interaction between rate summation and the mathematical structure of a particular development rate model are clearly demonstrated. This study shows that the selection of a development rate function for prescriptive use, based on closeness of fit to developmental data from constant temperature experiments, is meaningless. Nor should selection be based on how well a model derived from constant temperature experiments predicts insect development measured under a narrow range of fluctuating temperatures. Reasons why a nonlinear model fitted directly to rates observed under variable temperature laboratory or field data is inappropriate for subsequent prediction (in theory at least), are clearly demonstrated.

The response of orchid seeds to cold stratification have been studied, but the exact physiological role remains unclear. No studies exist that compare the effects of either cold stratification or temperature on germination among distant populations of the same species. In two separate experiments, the role of temperature (25, 22/11, 27/15, 29/19, 33/24 degrees C) and chilling at 10 degrees C on in vitro seed germination were investigated using distant populations of Calopogon tuberosus var. tuberosus. Cooler temperatures promoted germination of Michigan seeds; warmer temperatures promoted germination of South Carolina and north central Florida seeds. South Florida seed germination was highest under both warm and cool temperatures. More advanced seedling development generally occurred at higher temperatures with the exception of south Florida seedlings, in which the warmest temperature suppressed development. Fluctuating diurnal temperatures were more beneficial for germination compared to constant temperatures. Cold stratification had a positive effect on germination among all populations, but South Carolina seeds required the longest chilling treatments to obtain maximum germination. Results from the cold stratification experiment indicate that a physiological dormancy is present, but the degree of dormancy varies across the species range.

Temperature fluctuations during the day have a strong influence on the performance of laboratory-reared parasitoids. In field conditions, Trichogramma (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) wasps are exposed to variable temperatures during their development, which has a significant impact on their ability to control pest species. A simulation-based study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of variations in daily temperature on the pest-control abilities of female Trichogramma and their immature progenies. Considering the temperature variability of different agricultural zones of India, five temperature levels ranging from 20 degrees C to 40 degrees C were selected for daily short-term heat shocks to the immature progenies and egg-laying females of two major Trichogramma species. Intensity and frequency of thermal shocks showed inverse relationships with adult emergence, fecundity, and longevity of T. chilonis and T. poliae. Parasitoid pupae were found to be more tolerant to temperature variations than eggs and larvae. Fecundity and longevity of parasitoids were significantly reduced under high temperature shocks to egg-laying females. Sex ratio was significantly affected by high temperature shocks to the immature and adult stages. However, the effect was more severe in eggs. A female-biased sex ratio was apparent in both parasitoids throughout the experiment. Overall, daily short-term temperature shocks to different developmental stages of parasitoids showed radical effects on emergence, fecundity, longevity, and sex ratio of the progeny. Therefore, releases of parasitoids should be conducted when they are in their pupal stages during the morning and evening in order to achieve their highest effectiveness for pest management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1536-2442,,,,MAR 15,2014,14,,,,,,,,41,10.1093/jis/14.1.41,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jis/14.1.41,,,,,,,,25373188,,,,,WOS:000332829700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

For constant temperature regimes, this temperature sum can be reliably used to predict hatch and development of WCR larvae. In the first experiment in climate cabinets, we evaluated the effects of varying day-night (4 and 6 A degrees C difference) temperature regimes compared to equivalent constant temperature regimes on hatch, development, and recovery of WCR larvae from a non-diapausing population. Relative to constant diurnal temperatures, varying day-night temperatures resulted in earlier larval hatch and accelerated larval development (especially when day-night temperatures differed by 6 A degrees C) due to direct temperature effects (i.e., the Kaufmann-effect) and to enhanced plant growth. For WCR eggs, the temperature sums needed for hatch in the field are overestimated when they are determined by models based on constant experimental temperatures. Recovery of larvae from soil was not affected by temperature, but was positively associated with plant height. In a second experiment we evaluated whether the found effect of varying temperature ranges on the acceleration of larval hatch is also influenced by the level of these varying temperatures. Initial hatch started earlier by varying diurnal temperatures only under a low-temperature regime (14 +/- A 4 A degrees C). For herbivorous insects like WCR, plant growth effects induced by varying temperature regimes may result in increased variation in temperature-based developmental parameters.

The impact of the initial conditions at the synoptic hours of the day was more visible over the landmass compared with the oceanic regions. The diurnal variation of the surface temperature in the model simulation showed the major features when compared with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis except for the warm pool of northwest India and the Tibetan region. The surface pressure in the ECMWF reanalysis showed the semidiurnal cycle with two peaks at 0600 UTC and 1800 UTC; however, the range of the cycle was underestimated by the model simulation, showing only one peak at 0600 UTC. Significant variations in the diurnal cycle of rain intensities were seen among the different members. The model captured the diurnal cycle as the positive and negative peaks at 1200 and 0000 UTC with intensities at the peaks similar to 0.5 mm high and low, respectively, in the model simulation when compared with the observations. Presently, the seasonal forecast of ISM is generated through ensemble CAM experiments using different ICs taken from different dates but all at 0000 UTC.

An outdoor pot trial was also set up to study emergence patterns. All species showed higher germination in complete darkness than they did with a light regime, irrespective of dormancy level, time of the year, and temperature regime under which germination was tested, illustrating better germination when seeds are buried. T-b ranged from -2.6 to 0 C, depending on the species, indicating low temperature requirements for germination. Given their higher germination in daily fluctuating, rather than constant temperatures, the three Papaveraceae species should have the capacity to form persistent seed banks. These species behaved as winter annuals (from November to February) in the pot experiment and had difficulties to emerge in spring.

Gastric motility was never completely inhibited but could be markedly reduced. Stomach temperature was maintained at around 38degreesC. The fact that stomach temperature of incubating birds did not show a daily rhythmic fluctuation as seen in non-breeding birds could be due to temperature constraints on embryo development.

We monitored soil surface temperature (SST) variations over a 48 h period for three treatments in a vineyard: bare soil (plot S), 100% biochar cover (plot B), and biochar-amended topsoil (plot SB). The SST of all plots was monitored at 30 min intervals with a tripod-mounted IR thermal camera. The soil temperature at 10 cm depth in the S and SB plots was monitored continuously with a 5 min resolution probe. Plot B had greater daily SST variations, reached a higher daily temperature peak relative to the other plots, and showed a faster rate of T increase during the day. However, on both days, the SST of plot B dipped below that of the control treatment (plot S) and biochar-amended soil (plot SB) from about 18:00 onward and throughout the night. The diurnal patterns/variations in the IRT-measured SSTs were closely related to those in the soil temperature at a 10 cm depth, confirming that biochar-amended soils showed lower thermal inertia than the unamended soil.

Variations in water level, and therefore in-channel water volume, not only have the potential to directly impact stream temperature, but also aquatic vegetation coverage which, in turn, may affect stream temperature patterns and dynamics. Manipulation experiments provide a systematic approach to investigate the multiple environmental controls on stream temperature patterns. This study aims to use temperature data loggers and fibre optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) to investigate potential drought impacts on patterns in surface water and streambed temperature as a function of change in water column depth. To quantify the joint impacts of water level and associated vegetation coverage on stream temperatures, investigations were conducted in outdoor flumes using identical pool-riffle-pool features, but with spatially variable water levels representative of different drought severity conditions. Naturally evolved vegetation growth in the flumes ranged from sparse vegetation coverage in the shallow flumes to dense colonization in the deepest. Observed surface water and streambed temperature patterns differed significantly within the range of water levels and degrees of vegetation coverage studied. Streambed temperature patterns were more pronounced in the shallowest flume, with minimum and maximum temperature values and diurnal temperature variation being more intensively affected by variation in meteorological conditions than daily average temperatures. Spatial patterns in streambed temperature correlated strongly with morphologic features in all flumes, with riffles coinciding with the highest temperatures, and pools representing areas with the lowest temperatures. In particular, the shallowest flume (comprising multiple exposed features) exhibited a maximum upstream-downstream temperature warming of 3.3 degrees C (T in = 10.3 degrees C, T out = 13.5 degrees C), exceeding the warming observed in the deeper flumes by similar to 2 degrees C.

We experimentally reduced DTRsoil in the Chihuahuan Desert at Big Bend National Park over 3 years. We used shade cloth that effectively decreased DTRsoil by decreasing daily maximum temperature and increasing nighttime minimum temperature. A reduction in DTRsoil generated on average a twofold increase in soil microbial biomass carbon, a 42% increase in soil CO2 efflux and a 16% reduction in soil NO3--N availability; soil available NH4+-N was reduced by 18% in the third year only. Reductions in DTRsoil increased soil moisture up to 15% a few days after a substantial rainfall. Increased soil moisture contributed to higher soil CO2 efflux, but not microbial biomass carbon, which was significantly correlated with DTRsoil. Net photosynthetic rates at saturating light (A(sat)) in Larrea tridentata were not affected by reductions in DTRsoil over the 3 year period. Arid ecosystems may become greater sources of C to the atmosphere with reduced DTRsoil, resulting in a positive feedback to rising global temperatures, if increased C loss is not eventually balanced by increased C uptake.

Studies using variable thermal environments can improve ecological relevance of data because organisms naturally face day-to-day stochastic temperature fluctuations as well as seasonal changes in the amplitude of such daily fluctuations. The objective of this study was to investigate if, and to what extent, the use of constant temperatures is justified in studies of the model species, yellow dung fly, Scatophaga stercoraria (L.). We examined the effect of temperature fluctuation on the expression of several life history traits and the effect on subsequent adult longevity. We used two fluctuating temperature treatments with the same mean but different amplitudes (15/21 degrees C, 12/24 degrees C; 12/12 h), and three constant temperature treatments spanning the wide temperature range faced in the wild (12, 18, and 24 degrees C). Large temperature fluctuation was mostly detrimental (lower juvenile survival, slower growth, smaller body size, and longer development), whereas moderate temperature fluctuation usually gave responses similar to the constant regime. Whendeveloping in fluctuating temperatures, adult longevity (no effect), body size (lower), and wing shape (narrower wings) deviated from the expectations based on the constant temperature reaction norms, presumably because of acclimation responses.

A 56-d incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of constant and variable temperatures on SOC mineralization. Three soils were collected from the karst region in western Guizhou Province, southwestern China, including a limestone soil under forest, a limestone soil under crops and a yellow soil under crops. According to the World Reference Base (WRB) classification, the two limestone soils were classified as Haplic Luvisols and the yellow soil as a Dystric Luvisol. These soils were incubated at three constant temperatures (15, 20 and 25 degrees C) and cyclically fluctuating temperatures (diurnal cycle between 15 and 25 degrees C). The results showed that the 56-d cumulative SOC mineralized (C-56) at the fluctuating temperatures was between those at constant 15 and 25 degrees C, suggesting that the cumulative SOC mineralization was restricted by temperature range. The SOC mineralization responses to the fluctuating temperatures were different among the three soils, especially in contrast to those at constant 20 degrees C. Compared with constant 20 degrees C, significant (P < 0.05) decreases and increases in C56 value were found in the limestone soil under forest and yellow soil under crops at the fluctuating temperatures, respectively. At the fluctuating temperatures, the forest soil with lower temperature coefficient Q(10) (the relative change in SOC mineralization rate as a result of increasing the temperature by 10 degrees C) had a significantly (P < 0.05) lower SOC mineralization intensity than the two cropland soils. These indicated that differences in temperature pattern (constant or fluctuating) could significantly influence SOC mineralization, and SOC mineralization responses to the fluctuating temperatures might be affected by soil characteristics. Moreover, the warmer temperatures might improve the ability of soil microbes to decompose the recalcitrant SOC fraction., and cyclical fluctuations in temperature could influence SOC mineralization through changing the labile SOC pool size and the mineralization rate of the recalcitrant SOC in soils.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1002-0160,2210-5107,,,,AUG,2015,25,4,,,,,512,523,,10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30032-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30032-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000358630600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study we examined this relationship using 16 yr of annual measurements of herbaceous standing crop recorded at two study sites located on the Corona Range and Livestock Research Center in central New Mexico. Our hypothesis was that end-of-season herbaceous standing crop estimations could be improved using measured soil moisture instead of seasonal accumulations of rainfall as traditionally used for yield prediction. Daily recorded and simulated soil moisture levels were used to estimate the number of days over the growing season when soil moisture by volume was at low (< 20%), intermediate (20% to 30%), or high (>= 30%) levels. Defining regression equations to include either simulated or probe-recorded measures of soil moisture improved the adjusted R-2 of the regression models from 46% for the rainfall model to over 60% for various soil moisture models. Key variables for explaining annual variation in herbaceous production included seasonal moisture conditions, the amount of broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae [Pursh] Britt. & Rushy) present on the area, and the degree days of temperature accumulated over the growing season. Diurnal daily temperatures near historical averages were most advantageous for forage production. Simulated soil moisture data improved predictive grass yield estimates to a level equivalent to using onsite moisture probes to categorize daily moisture conditions.

Data were collected by three Brazilian research vessels at 10 individual sites, between 24 degrees S and 33 degrees S, During the measurements, the ships were stationed or drifted. At every location, series of temperature, salinity and density profiles were taken in the upper 50 m, accompanied by shipboard meteorology observations. At some locations, measurements of surface and underwater solar irradiance were also performed. The duration of time series varied from 8-72 h, The sampling intervals ranged between 0.5 and 3 h but normally were of one hour. Total duration of the series was 186 h, and the total number of individual hydrographic profiles in the dataset amounts to 159. The diurnal cycle of temperature was determined by fitting a sum of diurnal and semi-diurnal Fourier harmonics to the data. The diurnal range of SST varied from 0.1 degrees C to over 1.2 degrees C, controlled mostly by cloudiness and wind speed, The average range was about 0.5 degrees C for summer and 0.4 degrees C for winter observations, In most cases the observed diurnal cycle of temperature was confined to the uppermost 10 to 15 m. The phase lag between solar irradiance and sea temperature was normally about 4 h at the surface and increased downwards, typically by about one hour per every meter of depth. The sensible and latent fluxes exhibited regular diurnal variability, The divergence of the turbulent heat flux at a given depth in the bulk of the water column showed pronounced diurnal cycle, sometimes changing from - 150 to + 50 W m(-3) in the course of 8 to 12 h. A strong diurnal cycle of stratification was observed in the northern part of the region, with the average night-time values of buoyancy frequency smaller than the day-time ones approximately by one order of magnitude, while south of 31 degrees S stratification was mostly salinity controlled and represented small diurnal variation. In 3 of the observations, the night-time surface cooling led to convective instabilities and related overturns soon after midnight, resulting in rapid restratification of the water column and sign reversal of turbulent heat Bur. The vertical size of the overturns was about 10 m in two of the three cases and over 20 m in the third case, while the temporal scale was 1-3 h. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

An organism's environment, particularly early in development, can profoundly shape its future phenotypes. While the long-term consequences of embryonic temperature are well studied in vertebrates, insects have complex life cycles that may uncouple temperature's effects in one stage from physiology in the next. 2. This study examines how egg temperature affects insect performance across all subsequent life stages. We focused on the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, and examined how egg temperatures affected hatching time, hatchling mass, larval growth, development time, head capsule size, pupal mass and adult fecundity. Eggs were exposed to either diurnal temperature cycles or a single heat shock; in both experiments, temperatures were within the range to which eggs are typically exposed in the field. 3. Although the consequences of egg temperature varied depending on the type of treatment, both cycling temperatures and heat shock affected egg development time and initial larval growth rate, which likely have fitness consequences for M. sexta in nature. In contrast, egg temperature had no persistent effect on any trait measured in later larval stages, pupae or adults. 4. Organisms with complex life cycles -Manduca has four distinct life stages and multiple larval sub-stages - may benefit from rapid compensation for poor early conditions. Additionally, the modularity of insect life cycles may help insects cope with environmental variability by insulating later stages from disturbances during embryogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,JUN,2011,25,3,,,,,548,556,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01807.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01807.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290174500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The temperature factor was the main one conditioning the development of microgemipopulations. Special experimental observations on the development of rediae in the mollusc Melanopsis praemorsa (L., 1758) under different temperature conditions have shown that heating to 26-30-degrees increases significantly and cooling to 10-12-degrees, on the contrary, decreases the speed of the development of both maternal and daughter rediae. Normal development of rediae is possible within a temperature range from 5-7 to 34-35-degrees. The upper threshold of the range is limited by a fast death of infected snails when water temperature is over 35-36-degrees (in all cases the parasite's death was registered after the death of its intermediate host). Cooling below 6 C arrests the development of Ph. rhionica rediae. A long maintenance of microgemipopulation at a temperature close to 0 C leads to its death but does not always result in the death of the mollusc-host. Temperature is an important regulator of Ph. rhionica rediae reproduction speed but temperature fluctuations do not lead to transition from one type of embryo formation to another. The correlation between rediae and cercariae number is regulated only by the level of microgemipopulation development. Temperature is not the main regulatory factor for the daily rythm of cercariae emission but it affects the activity and life longevity of larvae.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-1847,,,,,JUL-AUG,1991,25,4,,,,,349,359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GR84300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Reliable simulation of mulched soil surface temperature is important for initial growth of spring crops. The hybrid Root Zone Water Quality-Simultaneous Heat and Water (RZ-SHAW) model and the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model use different approaches to quantify the effect of plastic film mulching on soil temperature. A two-year field study was conducted to compare the performance of the RZ-SHAW model and DNDC model for simulating the 5-cm soil temperature (T-5) under varying plastic film mulching coverages during seedling emergence of spring maize. Three treatments were used in this study: no mulching (PMO), full plastic film mulch (PM100), and partial plastic film mulch with 60 % coverage, i.e. 60 cm width of plastic every meter (PM60). Compared with no mulching, PM100 and PM60 treatments enhanced daily maximum and average T-5 (2.53 degrees C and 1.25 degrees C, respectively; p < 0.05) while not affecting the diurnal sinusoidal phase change of T-5 (2.45 degrees C and 1.21 degrees C, respectively; p < 0.05). The RZ-SHAW model was robust for T-5 simulation under mulching condition with RMSE and NSE ranged from 2.01 degrees C to 2.51 degrees C and 0.68 to 0.84, respectively, while the DNDC model failed to predict T-5 for mulched soil with RMSE and NSE ranged from 2.79 degrees C to 4.33 degrees C and 0.25 to 0.46, respectively. Employing T-ms (air temperature between plastic film and soil surface) to replace soil surface temperature may be one reason for the poor T-5 simulation of DNDC in mulched plots. By contrast, the RZ-SHAW model ran a complete calculation for heat and vapour transfer within the mulched layer, which robustly simulated atmosphere-soil surface temperature gradient in the plant canopy, surface covering, and soil surface in a broader range of climatic conditions. Additionally, the longwave radiation reflected back to the soil surface by the plastic, which was not considered by DNDC model, was important and enhanced T-5 simulation performance for RZ-SHAW under mulching condition. It suggested to imbed the SHAW module into DNDC for a sufficiently precise simulation of soil temperature and gas emission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-1987,1879-3444,,,,MAR,2020,197,,,,,,,,104517,10.1016/j.still.2019.104517,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2019.104517,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000514003800028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Severe drought mainly increased the specific radioactivity of C-14 of sheaths, roots and rhizomes, but significantly decreased that of fed leaves and the not fully expanded leaves. Root percentage of total radioactivity remaining in the whole plant increased from 15 % at 30/25 degreesC to 28 % at 30/20 degreesC. Leaf carbon stable isotope composition (delta(13)C) increased with soil drought, ranged from -26 parts per thousand of the well-watered to -24 parts per thousand of severe drought treatments.

The opaque cloud field itself has distinct cold and warm season diurnal climatologies; with a near-sunrise peak of cloud in the cold season and an early afternoon peak in the warm season. There are two primary climate states on the Canadian Prairies, separated by the freezing point of water, because a reflective surface snow cover acts as a climate switch. Both cold and warm season climatologies can be seen in the transition months of November, March, and April with a large difference in mean temperature. In the cold season with snow, the diurnal ranges of temperature and relative humidity increase quasi-linearly with decreasing cloud, and increase from December to March with increased solar forcing. The warm season months, April to September, show a homogeneous coupling to the cloud cover, and a diurnal cycle of temperature and humidity that depends only on net longwave. Our improved representation of the diurnal cycle shows that the warm season coupling between diurnal temperature range and net longwave is weakly quadratic through the origin, rather than the linear coupling shown in earlier papers. We calculate the conceptually important 24-h imbalances of temperature and relative humidity (and other thermodynamic variables) as a function of opaque cloud cover. In the warm season under nearly clear skies, there is a warming of +2 degrees C and a drying of -6% over the 24-h cycle, which is about 12% of their diurnal ranges. We summarize results on conserved variable diagrams and explore the impact of surface windspeed on the diurnal cycle in the cold and warm seasons. In all months, the fall in minimum temperature is reduced with increasing windspeed, which reduces the diurnal temperature range. In July and August, there is an increase of afternoon maximum temperature and humidity at low windspeeds, and a corresponding rise in equivalent potential temperature of 4.4K that appears coupled to increased precipitation.

Though broodstock has been maintained in captivity, detailed culture conditions are lacking. The present study investigated the effects of rearing temperature on reproductive conditioning. During a 4-week period, broodstock were subjected to temperature regimes characteristic of stable spring temperatures (spT), increasing spring to summer temperatures (sp-suT) and increasing spring to summer temperatures with daily fluctuations of 1 degrees C (sp-suT2). Broodstock were monitored for fecundity, egg lamella development and maturation, larval release rate, nauplius size and survival over 24 h. Cultured broodstock were fecund at smaller sizes (15.94 +/- 0.23 mm RC) than wild-collected individuals at the beginning of the experiment (17.71 +/- 0.65 mm RC). Fecundity increased significantly in all treatments and development of egg lamellae was highest in treatments in which the temperature increased over the experimental period (average 36% of mature egg lamellae in comparison to an initial 0%). Increasing temperature led to greater maturation of lamellae and more frequent spawning peaks. The number of nauplii released per aquarium (average 110 adult individuals) varied according to treatment and time, averaging 4670 +/- 506 nauplii day(-1). Due to the low number of larvae released daily, it is suggested that adults might release larvae gradually, as embryos hatch within the mantle cavity. Average release rates increased towards the end of the conditioning period, with releases on peak days ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 nauplii per aquarium. For spT, peak values were observed in week 3, while sp-suT and sp-suT2 showed peaks of release in weeks 2 and 4, when temperatures averaged 20 and 23 degrees C, respectively. Temperature oscillations led to shorter intervals between peaks of release. In terms of the larvae released, there were neither differences in numbers between treatments (128,147 +/- 13,548 nauplii per aquarium over 28 days) nor in size of nauplii (202.89 +/- 0.69 mu m GW) or 24-h survival (91.56 +/- 0.35%). Notwithstanding the need for further optimization, broodstock reproductive conditioning can be accomplished and a continuous supply of larvae obtained using the protocols described herein. Future studies should focus on the impact of food quality and photoperiod on reproductive conditioning, as well as the optimization of larval release induction protocols. Statements of relevance: The stalked barnacles (Pollicipes pollicipes) are considered a high-value food delicacy on the Iberian Peninsula, where interest over the culture of this species has risen in recent years. However, very little is known with regard to culture conditions.

Like other estuarine species, N. vectensis is exposed to large daily (>20 degrees C) and seasonal (>25 degrees C) fluctuations in temperature, requiring wide temperature tolerances. At the same time, the natural distribution of this species spans a pronounced thermal cline, which may promote the evolution of different temperature optima and tolerances in populations. We tested the thermal tolerance of N. vectensis adult and developmental stages, which showed all life cycle stages had critical temperatures within 1 degrees C (lethal temperature 39.5 to 40.5 degrees C). When temperature tolerance values were compared with recorded field data, N. vectensis is living in environments very close to their physiological limit. We utilized common garden experiments (13, 21, and 29 degrees C) to test for temperature-specific growth and regeneration rates in N. vectensis from different portions of this species' range. Temperature had a significant effect on growth and regeneration rate in all clonal lines, with a significant negative relationship between latitude of origin and growth rate at 29 degrees C. Individuals from higher latitudes did not exhibit higher growth rates at cooler temperatures.

The extratropical oceans are thought to exert noticeable feedbacks on the atmosphere especially on decadal and longer timescales, yet the large-scale atmospheric response to anomalous extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) is still under debate. Here we show, by means of dedicated high-resolution atmospheric model experiments, that sufficient daily variability in the extratropical background SST needs to be resolved to force a statistically significant large-scale atmospheric response to decadal North Pacific SST anomalies associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is consistent with observations. The large-scale response is mediated by atmospheric eddies.

The Arctic is warming at twice the global average rate; how native and non-native anadromous fishes will respond remains largely unknown. Some native Arctic salmonids are already experiencing warm (>21 degrees C), physically challenging migratory river conditions and large diurnal temperature fluctuations (>10 degrees C). 2. We conducted field and laboratory experiments to determine how these extreme conditions may affect the capacity for migration in Arctic and temperate salmonids. 3.In adult migratory Arctic char, reflex impairment following a handling challenge increased with temperature, indicating more extensive fatigue. In Arctic char smolts, temperature did not affect initial critical swimming performance (U-max1), however, there was a threshold for repeat swimming performance (U-max2) near 20 degrees C, above which recovery was impaired. 4. Following a simulated diurnal warming scenario (11-21 degrees C), U-max1 increased in rainbow trout and remained constant in Arctic char as in the field while U-max2 remained constant in rainbow trout it was drastically reduced in Arctic char. Furthermore, at warm temperatures, Arctic char were unable to recover to routine levels of oxygen uptake after exercise, while rainbow trout were. Warming also had more pronounced effects on blood composition and plasma glucose and lactate concentration in Arctic char than in rainbow trout. 5. In general, rainbow trout, a temperate salmonid, had superior swimming performance, aerobic capacity, and warm tolerance than Arctic char, an Arctic salmonid. 6. The present flow and temperature regimes in some Arctic rivers may restrict migration of native salmonids by limiting their ability to recover from fatiguing exercise. Non-native, temperate salmonids are likely better suited to overcome these particular physical and thermal challenges.",,,,,"; Tierney, Keith/H-8338-2012","Gilbert, Matthew/0000-0001-8000-7568; Tierney, Keith/0000-0002-8342-3783",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,MAR,2018,32,3,,,,,687,700,,10.1111/1365-2435.13006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13006,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000426503900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hence, we performed a scaled outdoor measurement to investigate the diurnal variations in air, and west and east wall temperatures within two-dimensional (2D) street canyons. We adopted the daily average temperature (T) over bar, daily temperature range DTR, and hottest time t(max) to describe the diurnal temperature characteristics. The influence of aspect ratios was considered (building height/street width, H/W = 0.5, H = 0.5 m, and H/W = 1, 2, 3, 6, H = 1.2 m). Canyon air experienced a smaller (T) over bar and DTR compared with the east and west walls. With an increase in the aspect ratio, no significant difference was observed in the (T) over bar of canyon air. The east and west walls of H/W = 2, 3, and 6 experienced lower (T) over bar (26.1-26.9 degrees C) and smaller DTR (11.7-18.4 degrees C) than those of H/W = 0.5, 1 ((T) over bar =26.7-28.7 degrees C and DTR = 16.0-26.1 degrees C). A higher phase lag of t(max) occurred between H/W = 0.5, and H/W = 6. As the aspect ratio increased, the differences in (T) over bar, DTR, and t(max) between the east and west walls decreased.

In a homogeneous water column, a rise in temperature induced marked increases in fish swimming activity, heart rate and heart beat-to-beat variability, In a thermally stratified environment, voluntary activity also increased when the thermal structure of the water column was altered, though no temperature-dependent changes in heart rate were observed, In this case, fish avoided the new temperature conditions, exhibiting distinct thermoregulatory behaviour, Stratification of the water column also prompted daily cyclic changes in fish distribution, animals tending to be in deeper and colder water layers during the day and in shallower and warmer layers at night. Respirometry experiments revealed that the thermoregulatory behaviour observed in free-ranging fish was probably driven by the energetic expedient of maintaining the physiological status quo - i.e. avoiding bioenergically costly reacclimation processes, Indeed, acute temperature increases or decreases of 2.5 degrees C led to marked differences in oxygen consumption, with metabolic rate changes of 15 and 30%, respectively, The persistent linear relationship between heart rate and oxygen consumption allowed us to estimate, from the heart rate recorded in free-swimming fish, the entire range of metabolic responses that cod underwent voluntarily while experiencing a thermally stratified water column, The most profound metabolic effect, however, was observed with feeding, when oxygen consumption increased by as much as 80%, resulting in an estimated 90% reduction in their subsequent scope for activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,JAN,1995,198,1,,,,,49,60,,,,,,,,,,,9317317,,,,,WOS:A1995QD18400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the causes for such daily chemical variations are not fully understood. We carried out laboratory culture experiments to investigate the effect of varying temperatures and light levels on organism physiology and shell geochemistry of the giant clam Tridacna crocea at daily time-resolution. We find that both temperature and light strongly influence shell growth rates. Besides demonstrating light enhanced calcification, we also observe growth inhibition during culture in continuous darkness. 'Ultra-high resolution' LA-ICP-MS analysis (Warter and Miller, 2017) in tandem with Ba-135-labelling allows both to identify newly secreted, cultured aragonite and investigate its trace elemental composition at (sub)daily resolution (B/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca). Overall, average Element/Calcium (El/Ca) ratios reveal an inverse relation with temperature and light. Strikingly, an increasing trend in all El/Ca ratios is observed in the direction of shell growth, which is interpreted to be metabolically-controlled, possibly related to organism 'stress'. Daily, cyclic trace element variability can be clearly resolved at similar to 5-15 mu m in relatively fast growing shells, which experienced a diurnal light cycle but constant temperatures. We conclude that light (but not temperature) is the primary controlling factor responsible for daily trace element variability. We further demonstrate that high El/Ca ratios correspond to growth during night time, i.e. low light intensities, corroborating field observations by Sano et al. (2012). Yet, because light levels were kept constant during night and day, respectively, light intensity cannot account for the entire range of the El/Ca variability. We hypothesize that Tridacna physiology and biochemistry is controlled by a circadian rhythm, initiated by the external factor light, but endogenously mediated by the giant clam and/or its photosynthetic symbionts.",,,,,,"Muller, Wolfgang/0000-0001-5368-8011",,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-0182,1872-616X,,,,MAY 1,2018,496,,,,,,32,47,,10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.038,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.038,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000428973000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, time-dependent effects - effects of the order and duration of exposure to temperature - can also influence mean performance. We quantified the non-linear and time-dependent effects of diurnally fluctuating temperatures for larval growth rates in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta L., with four main results. First, the shape of the thermal performance curve for growth rate depended on the duration of exposure: for example, optimal temperature and thermal breadth were greater for growth rates measured over short (24 h during the last instar) compared with long (the entire period of larval growth) time periods. Second, larvae reared in diurnally fluctuating temperatures had significantly higher optimal temperatures and maximal growth rates than larvae reared in constant temperatures. Third, for larvae maintained at three mean temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three diurnal temperature ranges (+/- 0, +/- 5 and +/- 10 degrees C), diurnal fluctuations had opposite effects on mean growth rates at low versus high mean temperature. Fourth, both short-and long-term thermal performance curves yielded poor predictions of the non-linear effects of fluctuating temperature on mean growth rates (compared with our experimental results) at higher mean temperatures.

The analysis provides a mechanistic explanation for the decreased amplitude of daily cycles in T-b and the increase in 'average' T-b with increasing mass. Assessments of 'average' daily T-b were made by dividing the integral of the difference between measured values of T-b and minimum operative temperature by the period of integration, to yield a thermal index expressing relative 'warmth' of crocodiles. The average daily T-b of a 1010 kg crocodile was 3.7 degrees C warmer than that of a 42 kg individual in summer and 1.9 degrees C warmer than that of a 32 kg individual in winter. The success of this mathematical approach confirms that crocodiles are simple ectotherms and that there is unlikely to be a significant contribution to their thermal biology from physiological mechanisms. Behaviour, however, is very important even in large individuals. Crocodiles in the field typically move daily between land and water in cycles that vary seasonally. We predicted T-b for the reverse of these behavioural cycles, which more than doubled seasonal fluctuations in T-b compared with the observed fluctuations. We were also able to predict the T-b of very large, dinosaur-sized crocodiles in a similar climate to that at our study site. A 10000 kg 'crocodile', for example, would be expected to have a T-b of 31 degrees C in winter, varying by less than 0.1 degrees C during a day when operative temperatures varied by nearly 20 degrees C, from 20 to 38 degrees C. The study confirms that, in low latitudes at least, large dinosaurs must have had an essentially high and stable value of T-b, without any need for endothermy. Also, access to shade or water must have been crucial for the survival of large dinosaurs at low latitudes. Furthermore, the finding of increasing 'average' T-b as ectotherms grow larger may have implications for the metabolic rates of very large reptiles, because the Q(10) effect could counteract the downscaling of metabolic rate with mass, an effect that seems not to have been recognised previously.",,,,,,"Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,JAN,1999,202,1,,,,,77,86,,,,,,,,,,,9841897,,,,,WOS:000078363300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

To account for this, a mathematical model has been developed on the assumption that hatchling sex depends on the daily proportion of embryonic development that occurs above the threshold temperature for sex determination rather than the proportion of time spent above the threshold. The model predictions are borne out by experiments using the marine turtle Caretta caretta. Average developmental rates, both overall and during the period that sexual differentiation is sensitive to temperature, are unaffected by diel fluctuations about the mean incubation temperature. Sex ratios, on the other hand, were affected by diel fluctuations and ranged from ca. 100% males under regimes 26 +/- 0 degrees C and 26 +/- 3 degrees C to 100% females for regimes 26 +/- 7 degrees C and 26 +/- 8 degrees C. These and intermediate sex ratios were in close agreement with model predictions. Demonstration of an impact of temperature on sex, while holding overall developmental rate constant, gives support to hypotheses invoking a direct role for temperature rather than alternative hypotheses invoking overall developmental rate as a more proximal influence on sex. The model explains why mean temperature is a poor predictor of hatchling sex ratios. It; urges caution in using ''hours above the threshold'' for predicting sex ratios, because 1 hr at 1 degrees C above the threshold will not be equivalent to 1 hr at 4 degrees C above the threshold. It provides a general framework for integrating experiments at constant temperatures with those in the field or laboratory using fluctuating regimes. It provides greater scope for exploring how reptiles with temperature dependent sex determination might respond to climatic change or other disturbances to the incubation environment. And it provides an explanation of why secondary factors such a hydric conditions and oxygen potentials might influence hatchling sex, even if temperature acts directly to influence sex ratios rather than through its influence on overall developmental rate.

Two types of buildings are investigated: hollow model means hollow concrete buildings and water model filled with water. Direct solar radiation, wall height, and wall orientation are significant factors that affect the diurnal variations of air-wall surface temperatures. The wall temperature shows a common declining trend from the upper heights to the lower heights.

We tested the impact of warming with DTR change on seed germination and seedling growth of eight species in the family Asteraceae. Four of these are invasive (Eupatorium catarium, Mikania micrantha, Biodens pilosa var. radiate, Ageratum conyzoides) in China, and four are native (Sonchus arvensis, Senecios candens, Pterocypsela indica, Eupatorium fortunei). Four temperature treatments were set in growth chambers (three warming by 3 degrees C with different DTRs and control), and experiments were run to mimic wintertime and summertime conditions. The control treatment (T-c) was set to the mean temperature for the corresponding time of year, and the three warming treatments were symmetric (i.e. equal night-and-day) (DTRsym), asymmetric warming with increased (DTRinc) and decreased (DTRdec) DTR. The warming treatments did not affect seed germination of invasive species under any of the conditions, but DTRsym and DTRinc increased seed germination of natives relative to the control, suggesting that warming may not increase success of these invasive plant species via effects on seed germination of invasive plants relative to native plants. The invasive plants had higher biomass and greater stem allocation than the native ones under all of the warming treatments. Wintertime warming increased the biomass of the invasive and wintertime DTRsym and DTRinc increased that of the native plants, whereas summertime asymmetric warming decreased the biomass of the invasives but not the natives. Therefore, warming may not facilitate invasion of these invasive species due to the suppressive effects of summertime warming (particularly the asymmetric warming) on growth. Compared with DTRsym, DTRdec decreased the biomass of both the invasive and native plants, while the asymmetric summer warming treatments (DTRinc and DTRdec) decreased the biomass of the invasive but not the native plants. In addition, wintertime DTRinc did not enhance the biomass of all the plants relative to DTRsym. Our results were obtained in an unrealistic setting; the growth conditions in chambers (e.g. low light, low herbivory, no competition) are quite different from natural conditions (high light, normal herbivory and competition), which may influence the effects of warming on the seedling establishment and growth of both invasive and native plants. Nonetheless, our work highlights the importance of asymmetric warming, particularly in regards to the comparison with the effects of symmetric warming on both invasive and native plants. Conclusions regarding the effects of future warming should be made cautiously because warming with different DTRs may suggest different implications for invasion, and effects of warming may be different in different seasons.",,,,,"Chen, Bao-Ming/H-9024-2016","Chen, Bao-Ming/0000-0003-1891-8752",,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-2851,,,,,,2017,9,,,,,,,,plx028,10.1093/aobpla/plx028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plx028,,,,,,,,28775830,,,,,WOS:000410143600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

An understanding of the upper thermal tolerance of Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout is important for developing water temperature standards and for assessing suitable habitat for reintroduction and management. Hatch success of Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout eggs was determined under static temperatures. The thermal requirements of fry and juveniles were also assessed under static and fluctuating temperature regimes using the acclimated chronic exposure method. Egg hatch success was 46-70% from 6 degrees C to 16 degrees C but declined significantly at 18 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Maximum growth of fry that were fed to satiation occurred at 15.3 degrees C. The 30-d ultimate upper incipient lethal temperature (UUILT) was 22.6 degrees C for fry and 21.7 degrees C for juveniles. Survival during fluctuating temperature experiments was dependent upon the daily maximum temperature and the daily fluctuation. The upper thermal limits for Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout were lower than those of Rainbow Trout O. mykiss but similar to those of other Cutthroat Trout subspecies. The low UUILT of Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout relative to some salmonids may increase the risk of deleterious effects brought about by a changing climate, habitat alteration, and sympatric nonnative salmonids, which are known to outcompete Cutthroat Trout at temperatures above the species' optimal range. Daily mean water temperatures near the Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout's optimal growth temperature of 15 degrees C would be suitable for reintroduction of this subspecies. Depending on the daily temperature fluctuation, daily maximum temperatures within reintroduction streams and current habitat should remain at or below 25 degrees C to ensure long-term persistence of a Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout population. This information will aid in establishing water quality standards to protect habitat where the subspecies currently occurs.

Potato is a secondary host of the species but the major threat from this insect in the Andean region for potato is the transmission by this insect of a crinivirus causing Potato yellow vein disease. Determination of the pest's temperature-dependent population growth potential is crucial knowledge for understanding the population dynamics and spread potential of the species and the diseases it can transmit, as well as for designing effective pest management strategies. Trialeurodes vaporariorum development, mortality and reproduction were studied at seven constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 32 degrees C. The Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software was used to fit nonlinear equations to the data and establish an overall phenology model to simulate life-table parameters based on temperature. In addition, life tables of T. vaporarionum were established at daily fluctuating temperature in two different environments: Cusco (5 degrees C-35 degrees C) and La Molina, Lima (13.7 degrees C-24.9 degrees C), and used to adjust and validate the model. The insect only completed its life cycle at constant temperatures above 15 degrees C and below 32 degrees C although the cycle was completed at daily fluctuating temperatures between 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The overall model portrayed population development within the temperature range of 14 degrees to 32 degrees C with a maximum finite rate of population increase (= 1.14) at 23 degrees C. However, the model revealed poor convergence with life tables established at fluctuating temperatures indicating an influential effect of temperature fluctuations on the whitefly life history parameters, particularly on adult survival time and reproduction. Therefore, we adjusted the model for convergence with a single life table observed at fluctuating temperature. The adjusted model gave good predictions when compared with remaining observed life tables and published data. The adjusted model predicted population development within the temperature range of 11.5 degrees C-35.5 degrees C, and maximum population growth at around 24 degrees C with a finite rate of increase, lambda, of 1.137 and a population doubling time of 5 days. The established process-based physiological model presented here for T. vaporariorum can be used for predicting the species distribution potential based on temperature worldwide and should prove helpful in adjusting pest management measures.

Each experiment consisted of a 1-wk acclimation under thermoneutrality (TN) (T-a = T-w = 21 C), a 4-wk heat exposure or treatment period, and a 2-wk recovery under TN. Each experiment involved 24 individually caged hens at the initial age of 29 wk (Experiment 1) or 30 wk (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, T-w of 18 or 27 C was provided to 12 birds per T-w regimen under a diurnal T-a of 27 to 35 C (daily mean of 31 C). In Experiment 2, T-w of 15, 19, 23, or 27 C was provided to six birds per T-w regimen under a diurnal T-a of 27 to 38 C (daily mean of 32.5 C). Experiment 1 showed that T-w of 18 C enhanced hourly and daily feed and water intake during the first 2 wk of heat exposure, as compared with T-w of 27 C. Experiment 2 showed that daily feed and water intake were greatest for hens in the 23 C Tw regimen and least for hens in the coolest or warmest T-w regimens. Reduction in daily feed intake with increase in daily mean T-a ranged from 2.0 similar to 3.2 g/C-day (first week of heat exposure) to 1.1 similar to 1.9 g/C-day (fourth week of heat exposure). Water to feed intake ratio was 1.8 similar to 2.0 during acclimation and recovery, but increased to 3.0 similar to 3.4 during heat exposure. Internal egg quality parameters were in general unaffected by T-w. The two warmer T-w regimens in Experiment 2 had less reduction in egg size than did the two cooler T-w. In both experiments, hens displayed anticipatory increase in feed and water intake 2 to 3 h prior to lights-off. However, the stimulus of lights-on did not elicit a strong return to feed and water consumption as typically seen in broilers. The results revealed the potential existence of an optimal T-w range (near 23 C) for heat-challenged laying hens.

Normally supply exceeds demand in cool temperatures, while the opposite is true at warm temperatures. To match supply and demand, photosynthesis is inhibited in the cool temperature range and synthesis (growth) is inhibited in the warm temperature range. The signal for the supply-demand imbalance is presumably obtained from the state of the carbohydrate pool (temporary storage), which fluctuates between a maximum level around sunset and a minimum level around dawn. A simple model, that incorporates this presumed mechanism, is presented and used to estimate the response of structural growth and of carbohydrate content to light and temperature in the cool and warm temperature ranges. The model predicts maximum growth rate at an intermediate temperature, which is positively correlated with light level. It also predicts an increase of nonstructural carbohydrate at cool temperatures. Both predictions are in qualitative agreement with observations. The model may be considered as an attempt at a mechanistic explanation of the observed phenomena, but experimental and modelling deficiencies currently restrict its predictions to the general features of the process only.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,978-90-66055-45-2,,,,2012,956,,,,,,231,238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000323764600025,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper reports observed changes in air temperature, soil temperature and soil-moisture content under experimental warming and clipping in a tallgrass prairie in the Great Plains, USA. We used a factorial design with warming as the primary factor nested with clipping as the secondary factor. Infrared heater was used in order to simulate climatic warming and clipping to mimic mowing for hay or grazing. The warming treatment significantly increased daily mean and minimum air temperatures by 1.1 and 2.3 degreesC, respectively, but had no effect on daily maximum air temperature, resulting in reduced diurnal air-temperature range. Infrared heaters substantially increased daily maximum (2.5 and 3.5 degreesC), mean (2.0 and 2.6 degreesC) and minimum (1.8 and 2.1 degreesC) soil temperatures in both the unclipped and clipped subplots. Clipping also significantly increased daily maximum (3.4 and 4.3 degreesC) and mean (0.6 and 1.2 degreesC) soil temperatures, but decreased daily minimum soil temperature (1.0 and 0.6 degreesC in the control and warmed plots, respectively). Daily maximum, mean and minimum soil temperatures in the clipped, warmed subplots were 6.8, 3.2 and 1.1 degreesC higher than those in the unclipped, control subplots. Infrared heaters caused a reduction of 11.0% in soil moisture in the clipped subplots, but not in the unclipped subplots. Clipping reduced soil-moisture content by 17.7 and 22.7% in the control and warmed plots, respectively. Experimental warming and clipping interacted to exacerbate soil-moisture loss (26.7%).

The uncertainty is due to the challenge and dearth of in situ measurements. Recent work in a subtropical stream system has shown the potential for diurnal variability to influence the downstream N transfer, N form, and estimates of in-stream N2O production. Studies in temperate stream systems have also shown diurnal changes in stream chemistry. The objectives of this study were to measure N2O fluxes and dissolved N2O concentrations from a spring-fed temperate river to determine if diurnal cycles were occurring. The study was performed during a 72 h period, over a 180 m reach, using headspace chamber methodology. Significant diurnal cycles were observed in radiation, river temperature and chemistry including dissolved N2O-N concentrations. These data were used to further assess the IPCC methodology and experimental methodology used. River NO3-N and N2O-N concentrations averaged 3.0 mg L-1 and 1.6 mu g L-1, respectively, with N2O saturation reaching a maximum of 664%. The N2O-N fluxes, measured using chamber methodology, ranged from 52 to 140 mu g m(-2) h(-1) while fluxes predicted using the dissolved N2O concentration ranged from 13 to 25 mu g m(-2) h(-1). The headspace chamber methodology may have enhanced the measured N2O flux and this is discussed. Diurnal cycles in N2O% saturation were not large enough to influence downstream N transfer or N form with variability in measured N2O fluxes greater and more significant than diurnal variability in N2O% saturation. The measured N2O fluxes, extrapolated over the study reach area, represented only 6 x 10(-4)% of the NO3-N that passed through the study reach over a 72 h period.

Commercially available fluctuating-temperature chambers are large and costly. This poses a challenge to experimental ecologists endeavouring to recreate natural temperature cycles in the laboratory because the large number of commercial chambers required for replicated study designs is prohibitively expensive to purchase, requires a large amount of space and consumes a great deal of energy. 2. We developed and validated a design for economical, programmable fluctuating-temperature chambers based on a relatively small (23 L) commercially manufactured constant temperature chamber ($140US) modified with a customized, user-friendly microcontroller ($15US). 3. Over a 1-week trial, these chambers reliably reproduced a real-world fluctuating (13.1-35.5 degrees C) body temperature regime of an individual frog, with a near-perfect 1 : 1 fit between target and actual temperatures (y = 1.0036x + 0.1366, R-2 = 0.9977, 95% confidence interval for slope = 1.0026, 1.0046). Over 30-day trials, they also reliably produced a simpler daily fluctuating-temperature scheme (sine wave fluctuating between 10 and 25 degrees C each 24 h) and a range of constant temperature regimes. 4. The design is inexpensive and simple to assemble in large numbers, enabling genuine replication of even highly complex, many treatment study designs. For example, it is possible to simultaneously examine in replicate chambers the responses of organisms to constant regimes, regimes that fluctuate following the means experienced by populations and regimes that exactly mimic fluctuations measured over any length of time for particular individuals that differ in behaviour or microhabitat use.

Daily body temperature (T-b) fluctuations in free-ranging bats were measured via radio-telemetry and metabolic rate was measured in captivity via open-flow respirometry (T-a 15-30 degrees C). Free-ranging bats showed a significant 24 h circadian cycle in T-b, with the lowest T-b at the end of the rest phase just after sunset and the highest T-b at the end of the activity phase just before sunrise. Average daily core T-b ranged from 34.7 +/- 0.6 to 37.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C (mean +/- s.d.) over an average daily T-a range of 17.1 +/- 1.1 to 23.5 +/- 1.8 degrees C.

The functions obtained were scaled up to show the theoretical changes of total radial root system resistance in a common tree orchard in a Mediterranean climate at a daily and seasonal scale, using recorded soil temperature values: a difference between summer and winter of 3.5-fold for olive 'Picual' and 9-fold for GF677 was observed. Nevertheless, R-p changes are not only related to temperature, as cavitation or circadian rhythms in aquaporin expression may also play a role. The results obtained from an experiment with the two cultivars submitted to constant pressure and temperature during several hours exhibited a variation in R-p, but this was of lower magnitude than that observed due to temperature changes. Finally, a comparison of R-p at 25 degrees C between GF677 and GN15 (another rootstock obtained from the same parental as GF677) showed significant differences. According to our results, diurnal and seasonal changes in R-p due to temperature variations are of significant importance, and it would therefore be advisable to assess them explicitly into soil-plant-atmosphere continuum models.",,,,,"Garcia-Tejera, Omar/AAC-1841-2021; Testi, Luca/AAO-1826-2020; Garcia-Tejera, Omar/M-7646-2018; Villalobos, Francisco J/H-1364-2012; Lopez-Bernal, Alvaro/H-5156-2015","Testi, Luca/0000-0002-8728-7563; Villalobos, Francisco J/0000-0002-0990-2970; Lopez-Bernal, Alvaro/0000-0002-1034-4718; Garcia-Tejera, Omar/0000-0001-7726-8118",,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,APR,2016,36,4,,,,,469,478,,10.1093/treephys/tpv126,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpv126,,,,,,,,26769470,,,,,WOS:000377404000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our data collected in the Adriatic show that the pronounced diurnal upwelling is also possible under milder wind-forcing and outside critical latitudes. It is found that the thermocline recorded in the summer of 2006 at the south coast of the island of Lastovo was subject to diurnal variability with a maximum range of about 30 m, and that the corresponding currents measured off the west coast of the island pointed to internal waves propagating around the island in a clockwise direction. We suggest that the summertime stratification occasionally promotes coastal waves that revolve daily around the island, creating the conditions needed for resonant excitation by sea breezes. Numerical modeling reveals that the 24-h waves are trapped around the island due to the influence of both the Coriolis force and bottom slope, and that the 12-h waves radiate away from the island.

This study aimed to identify, the appropriate time interval for air sampling in order to quantify the mean daily CH4 emission rate, key information to future studies aiming the derivation of regional indexes of CH4 emission. Three campaigns were performed to evaluate diurnal variation in CH4 emissions (3h interval) from continuously flooded rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. 'IRGA-422 CL') fields at different crop stages (panicle differentiation and ripening) and management systems (conventional tillage-CT and no-tillage-NT) during 2002/2003 crop season in long-term experiment at the Instituto Rio Grandense do Arroz (IRGA), in Cachoeirinha, RS, Brazil. Static chamber method was used and the air samples collected with polystyrene syringes were analyzed by gas chromatography. Methane emission showed a same diurnal pattern in the three campaigns in the both tillage systems. The maximum range of emission (8-33mg CH(4)m(-2) h(-1)) was observed in the early afternoon (12.00 to 15.00p.m.) followed by a decline to a minimum around midnight to next morning (4-19mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), in which fluxes were related to flood water temperature (campaign 1 and 3) or soil temperature (campaign 2). Taking into account the daily emission curves, plus operational aspects like chromatographic analysis of samples into the 24h period after air sampling, the time interval from 9.00 to 12.00a.m. is recommended to studies aiming to evaluate mean daily CH4 emission in rice fields. The close relationship between temperature and methane emission allows its infer about the suitability of the gas sampling procedure for the different rice sub-regions of South of Brazil (littoral region and south of RS, and south of SC) that present the same daily behavior of solar radiation and air temperature.

Long-term data were derived from weekly grab samples (1984-2010) and high-frequency data from 7-hourly samples (2007-2009) both measured at two sites: a headwater stream draining moorland and a downstream site below plantation forest. This study is one of the first to analyse upland streamwater nitrate dynamics across such a wide range of timescales and report on the principal mechanisms identified. The data analysis provided no clear evidence that the long-term decline in streamwater nitrate concentrations was related to a decline in atmospheric deposition alone, because nitrogen deposition first increased and then decreased during the study period. Increased streamwater temperature and denitrification may also have contributed to the decline in stream nitrate concentrations, the former through increased N uptake rates and the latter resultant from increased dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Strong seasonal cycles, with concentration minimums in the summer, were driven by seasonal flow minimums and seasonal biological activity enhancing nitrate uptake. Complex diurnal dynamics were observed, with seasonal changes in phase and amplitude of the cycling, and the diurnal dynamics were variable along the river. At the moorland site, a regular daily cycle, with minimum concentrations in the early afternoon, corresponding with peak air temperatures, indicated the importance of instream biological processing. At the downstream site, the diurnal dynamics were a composite signal, resultant from advection, dispersion and nitrate processing in the soils of the lower catchment. The diurnal streamwater nitrate dynamics were also affected by drought conditions. Enhanced diurnal cycling in Spring 2007 was attributed to increased nitrate availability in the post-drought period as well as low flow rates and high temperatures over this period. The combination of high-frequency short-term measurements and long-term monitoring provides a powerful tool for increasing understanding of the controls of element fluxes and concentrations in surface waters.",,,,,"Kirchner, James/AAC-4707-2019; Halliday, Sarah/B-1125-2013; Kirchner, James W/B-6126-2009","Kirchner, James/0000-0001-6577-3619; Halliday, Sarah/0000-0002-3308-9473; Kirchner, James W/0000-0001-6577-3619; Skeffington, Richard/0000-0002-4838-9030; Wade, Andrew/0000-0002-5296-8350",,,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2013,10,12,,,,,8013,8038,,10.5194/bg-10-8013-2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-10-8013-2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000329054600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two replicates of 6 pigs each (3 pairs of littermates; similar to 25 kg BW) were assigned to one of two temperature treatments: control (20 degrees C; C) or diumal HS (range 20 to 38 degrees C within 24 h; DHS) to provide six observations per temperature treatment. Pigs were housed in individual metabolism crates to facilitate separate collection of urine and faeces. After a 10-day acclimation period, pigs were fitted with indwelling arterial cannulae and a Foley bladder catheter for blood and urine collection, respectively. A wheat, barley and soybean meal-based diet was used and feed intake was paired between littermates in different treatment groups. After a 5-day recovery period, observations and sample collection were made during an 11-day experimental period. Plasma glucose and urea levels and the amount of minerals retained as a percentage of intake were similar between the treatments(P > 0.05). Likewise, faeces DM and mineral digestibilities did not differ between the two temperature treatments (P > 0.05). Diurnal heat stressed pigs had higher (P < 0.05) respiratory rate (105.2 vs. 15.0 breaths/min), rectal temperature (39.7 vs. 38.4 degrees C), heart rate (104.0 vs. 90.1 beats/min) and mean blood pressure, (97.4 vs. 81.7 mm Hg) compared to C pigs. Arterial PO2 rose (89.73 vs. 77.91 mm Hg; P < 0.05) and bicarbonate levels declined (25.82 vs. 27.24 mmol/L; P < 0.05) in the DHS compared to C pigs, but no differences in pH, pCO(2) and base excess levels were observed between the two groups. Blood osmolality was lower (P < 0.05) in DHS than in C pigs (287.1 vs. 291.3 mOsmol/kg) over the 11-day study period. Diurnal heat-stressed pigs had lower urine pH at 0700 (6.065 vs. 6.599; P < 0.05) compared to C pigs. Diurnal heat-stressed pigs had higher (P < 0.05) urinary levels of titratable acid (22.84 vs. 14.95 mmol/L), net acid concentration (33.36 vs. 23.49 mmol/L), and ammonium (11.05 vs. 9.88 mmol/L) compared with C pigs at 0700 but not at 1430 and 1900. Plasma T4 and aldosterone levels were not affected by temperature (P > 0.05) but T3 levels were lower (16.19 vs. 23.46 ng/dL; P < 0.05) in DHS compared to C pigs. It was concluded that although the diurnal pattern of heat stress used in the current study had no effect on mineral metabolism in growing pigs, it altered the physiological status, including acid-base homeostasis, as well as the more obvious thermal homeostasis.

R.",,,Do fluctuating temperature environments elevate coral thermal tolerance?,CORAL REEFS,,,,,,,,,,,,"In reef corals, much research has focused on the capacity of corals to acclimatize and/or adapt to different thermal environments, but the majority of work has focused on distinctions in mean temperature. Across small spatial scales, distinctions in daily temperature variation are common, but the role of such environmental variation in setting coral thermal tolerances has received little attention. Here, we take advantage of back-reef pools in American Samoa that differ in thermal variation to investigate the effects of thermally fluctuating environments on coral thermal tolerance. We experimentally heat-stressed Acropora hyacinthus from a thermally moderate lagoon pool (temp range 26.5-33.3A degrees C) and from a more thermally variable pool that naturally experiences 2-3 h high temperature events during summer low tides (temp range 25.0-35A degrees C). We compared mortality and photosystem II photochemical efficiency of colony fragments exposed to ambient temperatures (median: 28.0A degrees C) or elevated temperatures (median: 31.5A degrees C). In the heated treatment, moderate pool corals showed nearly 50% mortality whether they hosted heat-sensitive (49.2 +/- A 6.5% SE; C2) or heat-resistant (47.0 +/- A 11.2% SE; D) symbionts. However, variable pool corals, all of which hosted heat-resistant symbionts, survived well, showing low mortalities (16.6 +/- A 8.8% SE) statistically indistinguishable from controls held at ambient temperatures (5.1-8.3 +/- A 3.3-8.3% SE). Similarly, moderate pool corals hosting heat-sensitive algae showed rapid rates of decline in algal photosystem II photochemical efficiency in the elevated temperature treatment (slope = -0.04 day(-1) +/- A 0.007 SE); moderate pool corals hosting heat-resistant algae showed intermediate levels of decline (slope = -0.039 day(-1) +/- A 0.007 SE); and variable pool corals hosting heat-resistant algae showed the least decline (slope = -0.028 day(-1) +/- A 0.004 SE). High gene flow among pools suggests that these differences probably reflect coral acclimatization not local genetic adaptation. Our results suggest that previous exposure to an environmentally variable microhabitat adds substantially to coral-algal thermal tolerance, beyond that provided by heat-resistant symbionts alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0722-4028,1432-0975,,,,JUN,2011,30,2,,,,,429,440,,10.1007/s00338-011-0721-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-011-0721-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290327000019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pods grown at Yelbeni, Western Australia, in 1996 were collected in December and placed on the soil surface or buried at a depth of 0.5 cm at a site near Perth. Other pods were subjected to a gradual diurnal temperature fluctuation of 60/15 degrees C in darkness in a laboratory chamber. Pod samples were taken from the field at intervals from January to June in 1997, and over 336 days from the 60/15 degrees C treatment. Pods were broken into segments and the number of soft seeds determined. Numbers of latent soft seeds were then determined by subjecting residual hard seeds to 7 gradual diurnal temperature cycles of 48/15 degrees C in darkness and retesting for permeability. In a second experiment, seeds preconditioned at the soil surface until 3 March were subjected to a range of light levels in the field in March before testing for permeability. The time taken for seeds to precondition under a range of constant temperatures between 30 degrees and 70 degrees C was determined in a third experiment. Preconditioning commenced early in summer in both surface and buried seeds. All buried seeds that preconditioned completed the softening process to produce about 80% soft seeds, with most seeds softening in March when diurnal temperatures fluctuated between maxima of 45-50 degrees C and minima of 10-20 degrees C. Only 15% of the seeds at the soil surface softened so that relatively few preconditioned seeds completed the softening process. Preconditioning occurred more rapidly than did the completion of softening in the 60/15 degrees C treatment, indicating that this temperature regime was above optimum for the final stage of softening. Reversal of the preconditioning process took place in the field as temperatures declined during May. Effects of reduced temperatures in causing this reversion were confirmed in the laboratory on seeds preconditioned at 60/15 degrees C. The final stage of softening was inhibited in some seeds by light levels as low as 0.3% of daylight, and in all seeds at a light level between 5 and 25%. A close negative linear relation was obtained between the log of the time taken for 50% of seeds to precondition and the constant temperature treatment between 30 degrees C and 70 degrees C, with the rate of preconditioning doubling with every 5.2 degrees C rise in temperature within this range. Although many seeds preconditioned at the soil surface, the main constraint to completion of the seed softening process during autumn was the inhibitory effect of light.",,,,,"Revell, Clinton/AAB-1212-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-9409,,,,,,1999,50,7,,,,,1203,1209,,10.1071/AR98206,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR98206,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082457000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mathematical functions developed in long-term laboratory experiments at different constant temperatures were combined with daily water temperatures for 1991 - 93 in eight Austrian streams and rivers to simulate the complex life histories and reproductive capacities of two freshwater amphipods: Gammarus fossarum and G. roeseli. The functions describe brood development times, hatching success, times taken to reach sexual maturity, growth, and fecundity. The sex ratio was assumed to be 0.5 and an autumn - winter reproductive resting period was based on observations of six river populations. Simulations included summer-cold mountain streams, summer-warm lowland rivers, watercourses fed by groundwater or influenced by heated effluents, and varying amplitudes of change within each year. 2. A FORTRAN 77 computer program calculated growth from birth to sexual maturity of first-generation females born on the first day of each calendar month in 1991, and the numbers of offspring successfully released from the maternal broodpouch in successive broods. At the 1991 - 93 regimes of temperature, individual G. fossarum released 127 - 208 offspring and G. roeseli released 120 - 169 in seven or eight successive broods during life spans of less than 2 years in six rivers. Life spans extended into a third year in the relatively cool River Salzach (mean temperature 7.5 degreesC). They were not completed in the very cold River Steyr (mean 5.6, range 2.5 - 7.9 degreesC), where G. fossarum produced five broods ( totalling 120 offspring) and G. roeseli only two broods ( totalling 28 offspring) in the 3-year period. Except in the Steyr, some offspring grew rapidly to maturity and produced several second-generation broods during the simulation period; in the warmest rivers some third-generation broods were also produced. Birth dates, early or late in the year, influenced the subsequent production of broods and young, depending on temperature regimes in particular rivers. Total numbers of offspring produced by the second and third generations represent the theoretical reproductive capacities of G. fossarum and G. roeseli. Minimum and maximum estimates mostly ranged from 100 to 17 300, were larger for G. fossarum except in the warmest river ( March), where temperatures rose above 20 degreesC for 56-78 days in summer, and largest ( maximum 37 600) in the River Voeckla heated by discharge from a power-station (mean 11.5 degreesC). Results from the simulations agree with preliminary assessments of relative abundances for G. fossarum and G. roeseli in several of the study rivers, but in some one or both species appear to be absent. On a wider scale, the present study confirms that G. fossarum is potentially more successful than G. roeseli in cool rivers but indicates that neither species is likely to maintain viable populations in cold rivers strongly influenced by snow and ice-melt. 3. The potential impacts of future river warming by increases of 1, 2 and 3 degreesC, due to climate change, vary according to river site, date of fertilisation, the extent of temperature increase, and the species of Gammarus. For Austrian rivers with mean temperatures in the range c. 7 - 10 degreesC, future warming would result in modest changes in the life histories and reproductive capacities of both G. fossarum and G. roeseli; the former would find improved temperature conditions in watercourses that are currently very cold throughout the year, and both would find warm rivers less tolerable. 4. The high potential reproductive capacity of gammarids, with rapid production of numerous successive broods when sexual maturity is finally achieved, indicates adaptation to high mortality during the relatively long period of growth to sexual maturity, and provides scope for an opportunistic strategy of emigration from centres of population abundance to colonise new territory when conditions are favourable. Rapid expansion of populations is desirable to combat the effects of environmental catastrophes, both frequent and short-term floods and droughts, and more long-term climatic changes that have occurred several times in glacial - interglacial periods during the current Ice Age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,JAN,2003,48,1,,,,,53,66,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00967.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00967.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000179693900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

After acclimation, animals were exposed to either 10 degrees C or a 30 degrees C heat shock to analyze the proteomic changes in claw muscle tissue. Following acclimation to 10- 30 degrees C (measured at 10 degrees C), enolase and ATP synthase increased in abundance. Following heat shock, isoforms of arginine kinase and glycolytic enzymes such as aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate dehydrogenase increased across all acclimation regimes. Full- length isoforms of hemocyanin increased abundance following acclimation to 10- 30 degrees C, but hemocyanin fragments increased after heat shock following constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10-20 degrees C, possibly playing a role as antimicrobial peptides. Following constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10- 20 degrees C, paramyosin and myosin heavy chain type-B increased in abundance, respectively, whereas myosin light and heavy chain decreased with heat shock. Actin- binding proteins, which stabilize actin filaments (filamin and tropomyosin), increased during heat shock following 10-30 degrees C; however, actin severing and depolymerization proteins (gelsolin and cofilin) increased during heat shock following 10-20 degrees C, possibly promoting muscle fiber restructuring. RAF kinase inhibitor protein and prostaglandin reductase increased during heat shock following constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10- 20 degrees C, possibly inhibiting an immune response during heat shock. The results suggest that ATP supply, muscle fiber restructuring and immune responses are all affected by temperature fluctuations and subsequent acute heat shock in muscle tissue.

The spatial distribution of changes in seasonal mean maximum and minimum temperatures over the Indian subcontinent as simulated in combined greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol forcing experiment for the decade 1980-89 with respect to the control climate of decade 1880-89 is found to be in fair agreement with observations. An increase in annual mean maximum and minimum surface air temperatures of 0.7 and 1.0 degrees C respectively is projected over the land regions of the Indian subcontinent in the decade 2040s with respect to 1980s. The projected rise in maximum temperature is found to be most pronounced during the monsoon season while the rise in minimum temperature has its peak during the post-monsoon months over the region. A significant decrease in the diurnal temperature range over the Indian subcontinent during winter and no appreciable change during the monsoon season is suggested for the future.,,,,,,"Cubasch, Ulrich/0000-0001-9628-4666",,,,,,,,,,,,,0011-3891,,,,,NOV 25,1996,71,10,,,,,746,752,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VW73900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Matthew",,,Thermal refuge affects space use and movement of a large-bodied galliform,JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Temperature affects every organism on Earth and has been argued to be one of the most critical factors influencing organisms' ecology and evolution. Most organisms are susceptible to landscape temperature ranges that exceed their thermal tolerance. As a result, the distribution of landscape features that mitigate thermal extremes can affect movement and space use of organisms. Using Rio Grande wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) as a model species, we measured black bulb temperature throughout the diurnal period and identified vegetation characteristics at wild turkey locations and random landscape locations. We observed that the thermal landscape was highly heterogeneous with temperature varying up to 52 degrees C at a given ambient temperature. Vegetation type strongly influenced temperature across space during daily peak heating, with taller vegetation types (woody vegetation > 2 m) having mean temperatures up to 8.95 degrees C cooler than the remainder of the landscape. However, these cooler vegetation types were uncommon, only accounting for 8.2% of the landscape. Despite the rarity of tall woody cover, wild turkey showed strong selection for this vegetation type particularly during peak daily heating with 74.9% of locations within 18 m of tree cover. Not only did wild turkey alter space use across time relative to temperature variation, but they also altered movement. We found that on the hottest days ( >= 35 degrees C), wild turkeys decreased movement by three fold during peak heating, while movement on cooler days ( < 30 degrees C) was uniform. Collectively, our data provide evidence that space use and movement for large avian species can be influenced by the thermal environment, and that the thermal environment is an important component of habitat for a species.",,,,,"Fuhlendorf, Samuel/A-2931-2011","Fuhlendorf, Samuel/0000-0002-8726-9402",,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4565,,,,,FEB,2019,80,,,,,,37,44,,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.12.024,,,,,,,,30784486,,,,,WOS:000460827600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since soil temperature measurements are seldom available for regional applications, they have to be estimated from standard meteorological data. The objective of this paper is to present a general, simple empirical approach for estimating daily depth profiles of soil temperature from air temperature and a surface cover index (LAI; leaf area index) mainly focusing on agricultural soils in cold temperate regions. Air and soil temperature data measured daily or every fifth day at one to six different depths were acquired from all meteorological stations in Sweden where such records are available. The stations cover latitudes from 55.65 degrees to 68.42 degrees N and mean annual air temperatures from +8.6 to -0.6 degrees C. The time series spanned between two and ten years. The soils at the stations cover a wide range of soil textures, including two organic soils. We calibrated the model first for each station and then for all stations together and the general parameterization only slightly decreased the goodness of fit. This general model then was applied to two treatments in a field experiment: bare soil and a winter rape crop. The parameters governing the influence of LAI on heat fluxes were optimized using this experiment. Finally, the model was validated using soil temperature data from two barley treatments differing in LAI taken from another field experiment. In general, the model predicted daily soil temperature profiles well. For all soils and depths at the meteorological stations, 95% of the simulated daily soil temperatures differed by less than 2.8 degrees C from measurements. The corresponding differences were somewhat higher for the validation data set (3.9 degrees C), but bias was still low. The model explained 95% of the variation in the validation data. Since no site-specific adjustments were made in the validation simulations, we conclude that the application of the general model presented here will result in good estimates of soil temperatures under cold temperate conditions. The very limited input requirements (only air temperature and LAI) that are easily obtainable from weather stations and from satellites make this model suitable for spatial applications at catchment or regional scales.",,,,,"Kätterer, Thomas/L-2107-2013","Kätterer, Thomas/0000-0002-1751-007X; Andren, Olof/0000-0002-9817-6308",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-4710,,,,,,2009,59,1,,,,,77,86,,10.1080/09064710801920321,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710801920321,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000261735900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this knowledge gap, we subjected a coastal phytoplankton species, Heterosigma akashiwo, to ecologically relevant temperature shifts of 2-3 degrees C, cumulatively totaling 3-16 degrees C across a range from 6 degrees C to 31 degrees C over a 3-week period. Using a symmetric design, we show time dependent differences between growth rates and that these changes were related to the magnitude of the temperature shift, but not the direction. Cell size scaled inversely with temperature at a rate of -1.9 to -3.3%degrees C-1 at all except the highest temperature treatments > 25 degrees C. Intraspecific variability in growth rates increased exponentially with cumulative thermal shifts, suggesting thermal variability may be a driver of intraspecific variation. The observed acclimation effects on phytoplankton growth rates suggest that ignoring acclimation effects could systematically under or overestimate temperature-dependent primary production. Empirical results, contextualized with in situ coastal ocean temperature record, demonstrated that daily primary production could differ from current model assumptions utilizing acclimated rates by -33% to +36%. If broadly applicable to diverse phytoplankton species, these results have ramifications for predicting the ecology and production of phytoplankton in present day dynamic ecosystems and in future climate scenarios where thermal variability is expected to increase.",,,,,,"Strock, Jacob/0000-0002-5459-3468",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,MAR,2021,66,3,,,,,740,752,,10.1002/lno.11637,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11637,,OCT 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000583531800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

All other things equal, predator capture rates are expected to depend on encounter rate with prey, prey escape capability (including prey defences), and on predator agility. Ectotherm predators and their prey both respond to increasing temperature by increased activity, i.e. predators increase their search area and prey may enhance their escape capability. This means that, as temperature changes, the ability of a predator to catch prey will decrease, increase, or remain unchanged depending on the relative effect of temperature on predator and prey. Their responses may further be differentially moulded by light conditions depending on whether the predator is diurnally or nocturnally active. It was hypothesised that flying Diptera are vulnerable to carabid beetles only at low temperatures and over the full temperature range for spiders because carabids, in contrast to spiders, are not built to catch swiftly moving prey. 2. The first experiment examined the spontaneous locomotor activity of the predators and of fruit flies at different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and light conditions (light, dark). A second experiment examined the effect of temperature and light on the predation rate of two carabid beetles (Pterostichus versicolor and Calathus fuscipes) and two spiders (Clubiona phragmitis and Pardosa prativaga) using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as prey. 3. All four predators and the fruit fly increased their locomotory activity at higher temperatures. Activity of the carabid beetles peaked at intermediate temperatures; spiders and fruit flies were most active at the highest temperatures. Predation rate of the spiders increased with temperature whereas the beetles caught flies only at low temperatures (5 and 10 degrees C). 4. Diurnal variation in temperature may bring different prey groups within the set of potential prey at different times of the day or at different seasons. The ability of many carabid beetles to forage at low temperatures may have nutritional benefits and increases the diversity of interactions in terrestrial food webs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,,,,,APR,2008,33,2,,,,,305,312,,10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00978.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00978.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000253710000019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model is initialized with the stratification and shear of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and is driven with heating and wind stress. A surface mixed layer is determined by bulk stability requirements, and a transition layer below the mixed layer is simulated by requiring that the gradient Richardson number be no less than 1/4. A principal result is that the nighttime phase of the diurnal cycle is strongly affected by the EUC, resulting in deep mixing and large dissipation at night consistent with observations of the equatorial upper ocean during the 1984 Tropic Heat experiment. The daytime (heating) phase of the simulated diurnal cycle is very similar to that seen at mid-latitudes. Solar heating produces a stably stratified surface layer roughly 10 m thick within which there is little, O(3 x 10(-8) W kg-1), turbulent dissipation. For the typical range of conditions at the equator, diurnal warming of the sea surface is 0.2-degrees-0.5-degrees-C, and the diurnal variation of surface current (diurnal jet) is 0.1-0.2 m s-1, consistent with observations. The nighttime (cooling) phase of the simulated diurnal cycle is quite different from that seen at mid-latitudes. As cooling removes the warm, stable surface layer, the wind stress can work directly against the shear of the EUC. This produces a transition layer that can reach to 80 m depth, or nearly to the core of the EUC. Within this layer the turbulent dissipation is quite large, O(2 x 10(-7) W kg-1). Thus the simulated dissipation has a diurnal range of more than a factor of 5, as observed in Tropic Heat, though the diurnal cycle of stratification and current are fairly modest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,APR 15,1992,97,C4,,,,,5409,5422,,10.1029/91JC01918,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JC01918,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992HQ25600019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Woodlice (the terrestrial isopod Porcellio laevis) exhibit a readily observed behaviour that may reflect their acclimation capacities. When they find themselves on their back, they sometimes roll over (i.e. right themselves). Whether they do, and how fast they do it, are measures of their behaviour and performance that vary with ambient temperature. Goal: Measure experimentally the effect of acclimation to environmental thermal variability on the rollover behaviour of Porcellio laevis. Methods: Maintain woodlice in 24 degrees C laboratory environments. Each individual lived in one of three thermal treatments: constant temperature regime (delta = 0); a regime with alternating temperatures of 27 degrees C during daytime and 21 degrees C at night (delta = 3); and a regime with alternating temperatures of 32 degrees C during daytime and 16 degrees C at night (delta = 8). After 3 months, measure the rollover behaviour (percentage that rolled over) and rollover speed of the woodlice at 5, 15, 25, 32, and 38 degrees C. Rollover speed is the inverse of the time it took an individual to right itself. Results: At 5 and 38 degrees C, most woodlice seemed to be in thermal coma and had very slow rollover speed. At 15, 25, and 32 degrees C, rollover speed was in the range 0.12-0.18 rollovers per second. At 15, 25, and 32 degrees C, 52% of individuals righted themselves in similar to 4 s. At these temperatures, most individuals either rolled quickly or remained inactive for the entire 10-min test period. When we examined rollover speed in the cooler (night) and warmer (daytime) periods, individuals subjected to the three regimes of temperature variation differed: woodlice acclimated to delta = 8 roll over very fast when temperature (T) is low and very slowly when T is high; woodlice acclimated to delta = 3 roll over fairly fast when T is low and somewhat slowly when T is high; and woodlice acclimated to delta = 0 roll over quite quickly when T is low and quite slowly when T is high. However, the higher and lower speeds at different regimes neutralized each other so that average rollover speed over the course of a whole day did not depend on the size of the daily fluctuation. Conclusions: The impact of temperature variability must be taken into consideration. Behavioural responses that are seemingly costly in the very short term may be beneficial in the longer term.",,,,,"Rezende, Enrico L./S-3219-2019; Rezende, Enrico L/B-8029-2012","Rezende, Enrico L./0000-0002-6245-9605; Rezende, Enrico L/0000-0002-6245-9605",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-0613,1937-3791,,,,,2016,17,1,,,,,111,124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000384803400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the data obtained, temperature variation along the day was determined from 20 to 30 days after planting the sweet pepper seedlings, while the mean maximum and minimum temperatures and temperature range were evaluated every five days. The treatments with polyethylene film and clean weeding under the conventional tillage system showed an increase in maximum daily soil temperature at 6.7 and 5.0 degrees C, respectively, compared to no-tillage and weeding. The temperature range was 11 degrees C in the treatments using polyethylene film and clean weeding under the conventional system, 6.3 degrees C under no-tillage with weeding, 4.5 degrees C in the treatments without weeding, and 4.0 degrees C under no-tillage with polyethylene film.

These data have been analysed to examine the diurnal variability of upper oceanic heat budget and to estimate the eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat in the upper layer. Diurnal variation of near-surface temperature is typical at northern location (13 degrees N) with a range of 0.5 degrees C while the diurnal range of temperature is enhanced to 0.8 degrees C at the central location (10 degrees N) due to intense solar radiation (1050W/m(2)), clear skies and low wind speeds. At the southern location (7 degrees N), the diurnal variation of temperature is atypical with the minimum temperature occurring at 2000 hrs instead of at early morning hours. In general, the diurnal curve of temperature penetrated up to 15 to 20 m with decreasing diurnal range with depth. The VM-ADCP measured horizontal currents in the upper ocean were predominantly easterly/northeasterly at southern location, north/northerly at central location and northwesterly at northern location, thus describing a large-scale cyclonic gyre with the northward meridional flow along 87 degrees E. The magnitudes of heat loss at the surface due to air-sea heat exchanges and in the upper 50 m layer due to vertical diffusion of heat are highest at the southern location where intense convective activity followed by overcast skies and synoptic disturbance prevailed in the lower atmosphere. This and the estimated higher value (0.0235 m(2)/s) of eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat in the upper ocean (0-50 m depth) suggest that 1-D processes controlled the upper layer heat budget at the southern location. On the other hand, during the fair weather conditions, at the central and northern locations, the upper layer gained heat energy, while the sea surface lost (gained) heat energy at northern (central) location. This and lower values of eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat (0.0045 and 0.0150 m(2)/s) and the northward intensification of horizontal currents at these locations suggest the greater role of horizontal heat advection over the 1-D processes in the upper ocean heat budget at these two locations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0253-4126,,,,,JUN,2000,109,2,,,,,267,277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000089267000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thirty, clinically healthy free-ranging donkeys, divided into 3 groups of 10 donkeys each according to their age, served as experimental subjects. Behavioral activities of donkeys were monitored bihourly from 06:00 to 06:00 h (GMT +1) during the cold-dry and hot-dry seasons. Application of single cosinor procedure showed that behavioral activities exhibited varying levels of daily rhythmicity in both seasons. Behavioral activities of adult, yearling, and foal donkeys peaked during the afternoon period (13:11-14:45 h) of the photophase of the light-dark cycle during the cold-dry and hot-dry seasons. The diurnal index of activity rhythm showed that donkeys are mostly diurnal animals. During the study period, the percentage time spent on feeding during the harmattan season was higher (P < 0.05) than during the hot-dry season in adults (37.38 +/- 1.57% vs 30.72 +/- 1.29%), yearlings (33.20 +/- 1.43% vs 27.00 +/- 125%), and foals (16.79 +/- 0.82% vs 14.38 +/- 0.65%). The percentage time spent dozing during the hot-dry season by adults (28.21 +/- 1.59%), yearlings (29.31 +/- 1.60%), and foals (37.64 +/- 1.48%) was higher (P < 0.05), when compared with the corresponding values (23.75 +/- 1.55%, 26.43 +/- 1.59% and 42.42 +/- 1.40%, respectively) obtained during the harmattan season. In conclusion, daily rhythmicity of behavioral activities in donkeys, kept under natural light-dark cycle, was similar in both seasons, although the intensity of activity was higher in the cold-dry than the hot-dry season.

An unresolved question is what role individual factors such as growth play in regulating elemental incorporation. Disentangling growth variation from thermal effects is particularly challenging in fishes yet integral to understanding the mechanisms of incorporation and interpreting patterns of variation in the field. Juvenile Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) were maintained in a controlled laboratory setting to evaluate the relative importance of growth rate, ration, and temperature on otolith elemental incorporation. Fish were held at four temperatures (2, 5, 9, 13 degrees C) and fed daily to apparent satiation. An additional treatment included fish that were held at 9'C and fed a reduced ration (1% body mass d(-1)). Fish were maintained for variable duration (40-147 d), depending on ration and temperature, to ensure adequate otolith growth for analysis. Water samples for chemical analysis were collected to determine elemental partition coefficients (D-Me). Overall, mean growth rates ranged from -0.09 to 1.52% d(-1). For the 9 degrees C fish, there was a clear ration effect on D-Mn (2.6X higher at high ration) and D-Sr (1.5X higher at low ration), a small effect for D-Mg (1.1X higher at high ration), and no effect for D-Ba. For high ration fish, there was a positive effect of temperature on D-Mn and D-Mg, due solely to differences associated with the 2 degrees C treatment, and no effect on D(Sr )and D-Ba. Correlations between growth and D Me within temperature treatments were variable, but for D-Mn and D-Sr the directionality mirrored the ration effect with positive correlations for D-Mn and negative correlations for D-Sr. Overall, the observed ration effects were greater than any growth rate effect, indicating that the effect of ration is due to more than growth variation.",,,,,,"Miller, Jessica/0000-0002-6491-4085",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,MAY 26,2020,7,,,,,,,,320,10.3389/fmars.2020.00320,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.00320,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000535529800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present paper, records over the period 1987-2004 from a long-term agroecosystem experiment carried out in Northeast China were used to explore the impacts of global warming on soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) yields under different controlled fertilization treatments. The results indicated that soybean yields were closely related to growing season temperatures. In most fertilization treatments, soybean yields showed a significant negative response to higher daily maximum temperature and greater diurnal temperature range (DTR), whereas they showed a significant positive response to higher daily minimum temperature. Analysis of covariance showed that these responses of soybean yields to temperature variables did not differ across fertilization treatments. Overall, soybean yields have declined significantly due to the warming trends since 1987. This has been mainly attributed to the higher daily maximum temperature. The present report demonstrates that soybean production in Northeast China may face challenges due to global warming unless potential adaptation options are adopted. The true mechanisms behind these yield impacts need further investigation to address effective agricultural adaptations for soybean systems to adapt to global warming.",,,,,"zheng, HAIFENG/B-8197-2012","zheng, HAIFENG/0000-0002-4571-8476",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8596,1469-5146,,,,OCT,2009,147,,5,,,,569,580,,10.1017/S002185960900879X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002185960900879X,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000269860500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Observations during the non-feeding period were made every 4 degree-days for the 4,8 and 12 degreesC treatments, and every day for the 2 degreesC treatment. Once feeding was initiated, observations were made every 12 degree days for all treatments. Data were collected from two synchronized experiments. For experiment 1 the development stage of eggs, yolk-sac size (of yolk-sac larvae), and the standard length, feeding incidence and condition of larvae were recorded. For experiment 2, the effect of temperature on the mortality of eggs and larvae was evaluated. The mean time for eggs to reach the exogenous feeding stage (stage duration) and the initial feeding incidence of larvae, the mean daily increase in larval length (growth), mean yolk reduction, and the mean survival times for eggs and larvae were calculated. The growth-temperature relationship was evaluated using a log-normal model, from which two temperature values were calculated. First, where growth rate per degree was maximized (G(TMAX) = 4.2 degreesC), and second, where growth per day was maximized (G(MAX) = 7.9 degreesC). Increasing temperature resulted in a linear increase in In (yolk reduction), an exponential decrease in stage duration, and a dome-shaped relationship with feeding incidence. The mean survival time during the egg stage showed an exponential decrease with temperature while, for larvae, survival time was modeled using a log-normal equation.

Given that hop is a long-lived perennial and that brewers still demand Cascade, there is a need to better understand factors that influence the development of powdery mildew on this cultivar. Growth chamber experiments were conducted to quantify the effect of constant, transient, and fluctuating temperature on Cascade before, concurrent to, and after inoculation as contrasted with another powdery mildew-susceptible cultivar, 'Symphony'. Exposure of plants to supraoptimal temperature (26 and 32 degrees C) before inoculation led to more rapid onset of ontogenic resistance in intermediately aged leaves in Cascade as compared with Symphony. Cascade was overall less susceptible to powdery mildew when exposed to constant temperature ranging from 18 to 32 degrees C directly after inoculation. However, cultivar also interacted with temperature such that proportionately fewer and smaller colonies developed on Cascade than Symphony at supraoptimal yet permissive temperatures for disease. When plants were inoculated and then exposed to high temperature, colonies became progressively more tolerant to temperatures of 26 to 30 degrees C with increasing time from inoculation to exposure, as moderated by cultivar, the specific temperature, and their interaction. Subjecting plants to simulated diurnal temperature regimes at the time of inoculation or 24 h later indicated Cascade and Symphony responded proportionately similarly on days predicted to be marginally unfavorable or marginally favorable for powdery mildew, although Cascade was quantitatively less susceptible than Symphony. In sum, this research indicates that Cascade is overall less susceptible to powdery mildew than Symphony, and supraoptimal temperature before, concurrent to, or after infection may interact differentially to moderate disease risk in Cascade. Therefore, cultivar-specific risk assessments for powdery mildew appear warranted.",,,,,,"Gent, David/0000-0001-9529-9831",,,,,,,,,,,,,0191-2917,1943-7692,,,,JUN 1,2022,106,6,,,,,1681,1689,,10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2133-RE,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2133-RE,,MAY 2022,,,,,,34978868,,,,,WOS:000791672900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Germination of dry-stored achenes was tested at increasing amplitudes of temperature fluctuations, and stratified achenes were germinated at constant temperatures. Dormancy release was examined in the laboratory at constant temperatures of 3, 8, 12, 15 and 18 degrees C. The effect of an increase in temperature during stratification from 5 degrees C to 15, 18 or 20/10 degrees C on dormancy was tested. Moreover, achenes were exposed to yearly seasonal temperature cycles in the soil in an experimental garden. Germination of dry-stored achenes was not promoted by fluctuating temperatures, while stratified achenes germinated (> 5%) over a range of constant temperatures between 9 and 36 degrees C. Dormancy was relieved at all stratification temperatures, but temperatures l12 degrees C were more effective than higher temperatures, since germination occurred over a wider range of test conditions after these pretreatments. An induction of secondary dormancy occurred only if the temperature was increased during stratification. Annual dormancy cycles were apparent when achenes were germinated at 15 degrees C, while at 25 and 15/5 degrees C germination was always > 60%. The germination behaviour of Eupatorium is that of a typical wetland species. Thus, non-dormant achenes germinated at relatively high temperatures, and germination was promoted by fluctuating temperatures. The annual course of dormancy revealed that achenes can germinate throughout the growing season under favourable conditions. Achenes sown in an experimental garden germinated in spring, when daily mean temperatures were around 14 degrees C. A decline in viability of achenes after 19 months' burial indicated that Eupatorium does not form a long-term persistent seed bank.",,,,,"Jensen, Kai/L-6657-2015","Jensen, Kai/0000-0002-0543-070X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-2585,,,,,JUN,2005,15,2,,,,,143,151,,10.1079/SSR2005202,http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/SSR2005202,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000230082800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, most previous studies on the effects of climate change utilized a model of uniform annual change, which assumes that temperature increases are symmetric on diurnal or seasonal time scales. In this study, we simulated observed trends in the asymmetric alteration of diurnal temperature range by increasing night-time temperatures experienced by female lizards during their ovarian cycle as well as by the resulting eggs during their incubation. We found that higher night-time temperatures during the ovarian cycle increased the probability of reproductive success and decreased the duration of the reproductive cycle, but did not affect embryo stage or size at oviposition, clutch size, egg mass or relative clutch mass. Furthermore, higher incubation temperatures increased hatchling size and decreased incubation period but had no effect on incubation success. Subsequent hatchlings were more likely to survive winter if they hatched earlier, though our sample size of hatchlings was relatively small. These findings indicate that higher night-time temperatures mainly affect rate processes and that certain aspects of life history are less directly temperature dependent. As our findings confirm that climate warming is likely to increase the rate of development as well as advance reproductive phenology, we predict that warmer nights during the breeding season will increase reproductive output as well as subsequent survival in many temperate ectotherms, both of which should have positive fitness effects.",,,,,"Clarke, D.

Temperatures >= 7 degrees C increased the proportion of unfertilized and abnormally dividing eggs, deformed embryos and consequent mortality. The higher the temperature, the more severe were the effects. When eggs were fertilized and constantly incubated at various temperatures, the effective level for 50% of the eggs and embryos (EL50) of temperature was 7.6 degrees C at the developmental stage when eye pigmentation was visible. Fewer developmental abnormalities and a lower cumulative mortality rate were observed when embryos were exposed to high temperatures from the later, gastrula stage, than from fertilization or the four-cell stage. Irrespective of retarded development in terms of day-degrees (i.e. the sum of daily mean temperatures), a high incubation temperature reduced the development time of C. lavaretus, leading to earlier hatching, and hatched fry were shorter than at the reference temperature of 4-5 degrees C.

Three processes - the diurnal cycle of clouds during different cloud regimes over the central US, precipitation and diabatic heating associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the response of precipitation, surface radiative and heat fluxes, as well as zonal wind stress to sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation - are evaluated as examples to demonstrate how one can better utilize simulations from this experiment to gain insights into model errors and their connection to physical parameterizations or large-scale state. This is achieved by comparing the hindcasts with corresponding long-term observations for periods based on different phenomena. These analyses can only be done through this multi-year hindcast approach to establish robust statistics of the processes under well-controlled large-scale environment because these phenomena are either a result of interannual climate variability or only happen a few times in a given year (e.g., MJO, or cloud regime types). Furthermore, comparison of hindcasts to the typical simulations in climate mode with the same model allows one to infer what portion of a model's climate error directly comes from fast errors in the parameterizations of moist processes. As demonstrated here, model biases in the mean state and variability associated with parameterized moist processes usually develop within a few days and manifest within weeks to affect the simulations of large-scale circulation and ultimately the climate mean state and variability.

Some species are potential biofuel feedstocks because they are highly productive in seasonally dry landscapes. In plants with CAM, high growth rates are often believed to be associated with a significant contribution of C-3 photosynthesis to total carbon gain when conditions are favourable. There has even been a report of a shift from CAM to C-3 in response to overwatering a species of Agave. We investigated whether C-3 photosynthesis can contribute substantially to carbon uptake and growth in young and mature Agave angustifolia collected from its natural habitat in Panama. In well-watered plants, CO2 uptake in the dark contributed about 75% of daily carbon gain. This day/night pattern of CO2 exchange was highly conserved under a range of environmental conditions and was insensitive to intensive watering. Elevated CO2 (800 ppm) stimulated CO2 fixation predominantly in the light. Exposure to CO2-free air at night markedly enhanced CO2 uptake during the following light period, but CO2 exchange rapidly reverted to its standard pattern when CO2 was supplied during the subsequent 24 h. Although A. angustifolia consistently engages in CAM as its principal photosynthetic pathway, its relatively limited photosynthetic plasticity does not preclude it from occupying a range of habitats, from relatively mesic tropical environments in Panama to drier habitats in Mexico.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,JUL,2014,65,13,,,SI,,3695,3703,,10.1093/jxb/eru097,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eru097,,,,,,,,24648568,,,,,WOS:000339953400031,View Full Record in Web of Science

Potted plants were inoculated with B. lactucae, incubated at 13 C for 12 or 24 h to initiate infection, and subjected to different temperature treatments by moving them to growth chambers operating at diurnally alternating temperatures, moving them outdoors to naturally varying temperatures, or holding them at constant conditions. Subsets of plants incubated at fluctuating temperatures were returned to constant conditions at 24-h intervals to simulate a wide range in thermal exposure during the latent period. Cumulative numbers of sporulating lesions were recorded for each plant daily from 5 to 14 days after inoculation. Minimum and median latent periods (LP(0) and LP(50), respectively) were determined for each cultivar and temperature treatment at the end of the experiments. LP(0) and LP(50) were expressed as days, in degree-hours (accumulated hourly temperatures above a threshold of 0 C), and in units of accumulated hourly developmental rates derived from a nonlinear function fit to values of LP(0) from a previous constant-temperature study. We found that the variability in LP(0) and LP(50) was greater when latent periods were measured in degree-hours (coefficient of variation [CV] between 6.2 and 30.9%) or developmental rates (6.4% less than or equal to CV less than or equal to 48.6%) than when they were measured in days (4.0% less than or equal to CV less than or equal to 17.5%). Thus, there seems to be little advantage in using degree-hours or developmental rates to model latent periods of lettuce downy mildew.

Sequential measurements of body temperature, air temperature, relative humidity and THI were monitored every 5 min. Four cross-bred Holstein-Frisian (93.75% HF) cows were assigned randomly to be used in two trial periods to determine the effects of heat stress and improved cooling system on body temperature. The experiment was conducted in the barn for a total of 6 days, 3 days without a supplemental cooling system (control) and 3 days with a supplemental cooling system (treatment). All cows were housed in the same barn throughout the experiment, but the treatment animals were exposed to the improved cooling system with sprinklers and fans in the holding pen 7 times a day. In this study, air temperature was negatively correlated (r = -0.983, p < 0.0001) with relative humidity, but positively correlated with THI (r = 0.996, p < 0.001). In addition, THI and air temperature were positively correlated (r = 0.709, p < 0.0001 and r = 0.714, p < 0.0001, respectively) with body temperature of the control animals. The mean level of body temperature of the control animals was higher (p < 0.05) than the treatment animals. Body temperature of the control animals consistently rose during the day, reaching a peak in the afternoon (1400 h), after which it remained relatively stable until midnight and then fell throughout early morning. The daily rhythmicity of body temperature had a mean level of 39.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C with a maximum-minimum range of 0.9 degrees C in the control animals. In contrast, body temperatures of the treatment animals fell by 0.3-1.0 degrees C after the improved cooling occurred at 0500, 0900, 1100, 1400, 1600, 1900 and 2200 h. Thus, their body temperatures were maintained in the range of 37.9-39.4 degrees C. The mean level of body temperature of these animals was 38.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C. In conclusion, climatic conditions have a significant influence on body temperature. Body temperature of dairy cows under tropical conditions has a daily rhythmicity, with a period of rising body temperature and increasing heat load during the day (hyperthermia), followed by a period of heat dissipation and falling body temperature during the night. Improved intensive cooling with sprinklers and fans has the potential to decrease the severity of heat stress and maintain a normal body temperature of dairy cows under hot and humid climatic conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0125-6491,,,,,SEP,2013,43,3,,,,,367,373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000339784200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such variations result primarily from imbalances between surface freshwater fluxes and vertical mixing of deeper water to the surface. New observations becoming available from satellite salinity remote sensing missions could help to constrain estimates of diurnal variations in air-sea exchange of freshwater, and provide insight into the processes governing diurnal variability of mixing processes in the upper ocean. Additionally, a better understanding of variation in near surface salinity is required to compare satellite measured SSS with in situ measurements at a few meters depth. The diurnal SSS variations should be reflected as differences between ascending and descending pass retrievals from the Aquarius and SMOS satellites; however, the diurnal signal can be masked by inadequacies of the geophysical corrections used in processing the satellite measurements. In this study, we quantify the expected range of diurnal SSS variations using a model developed for predicting diurnal sea surface temperature variations. We present estimates for the mean and variance of the global diurnal SSS cycle, contrasting it with the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. We find the SSS diurnal cycle can be significant throughout the tropics, with mean amplitudes of up to 0.1 psu in areas with heavy precipitation. Predicted maximum diurnal ranges approach 2 psu in select regions. Surface freshening in Aquarius salinity retrievals is shown to be larger for ascending than descending passes, consistent with the expectations from the model simulation.",,,,,"Bryan, Frank O/I-1309-2016","Bryan, Frank O/0000-0003-1672-8330; Bailey, David/0000-0002-6584-0663",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,MAY,2015,120,5,,,,,3211,3228,,10.1002/2014JC010483,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JC010483,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000356628100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The molecular mechanisms that generate circadian behaviours in model organisms have been well studied, but longer phase cycles and interactions between cycles with different periodicities remain poorly understood. Broadcast spawning corals are one of the best examples of an organism integrating inputs from multiple environmental parameters, including seasonal temperature, the lunar phase and hour of the day, to calibrate their annual reproductive event. We present a deep RNA-sequencing experiment utilizing multiple analyses to differentiate transcriptomic responses modulated by the interactions between the three aforementioned environmental parameters. Acropora millepora was sampled over multiple 24-hr periods throughout a full lunar month and at two seasonal temperatures. Temperature, lunar and diurnal cycles produce distinct transcriptomic responses, with interactions between all three variables identifying a core set of genes. These core genes include mef2, a developmental master regulator, and two heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, one of which is known to post-transcriptionally interact with mef2 and with biological clock-regulating mRNAs. Interactions between diurnal and temperature differences impacted a range of core processes ranging from biological clocks to stress responses. Genes involved with developmental processes and transcriptional regulation were impacted by the lunar phase and seasonal temperature differences. Lastly, there was a diurnal and lunar phase interaction in which genes involved with RNA-processing and translational regulation were differentially regulated.

The objective of this study is to present spatial and temporal variations of air temperatures and relative humidity on the north slope of Mt. Qomolangma. Both hourly air temperatures and relative humidity were measured at seven automatic weather stations (AWS) from 5207 to 7028 m a.s.l. from May 2007 through September 2008. Long-term (1959-2007) air temperature and precipitation data were obtained from Dingri Meteorological Station. The preliminary results show that the elevational gradient of mean annual air temperature is non-linear, which decreases from 0.2 degrees C at an elevation of 5207 m to -4.4 degrees C at 5792 m, and -5.4 degrees C at 5955 m. The maxima are 14.6, 9.1, and 18.6 degrees C, and the minima are -24.2, -28.8, and -29.3 degrees C at the three elevations, respectively. The relative humidity does not change significantly with increasing elevation except over glacier ice, but the mixing ratio decreases due to the decrease in air temperature. The mean diurnal ranges of air temperature and relative humidity decrease with increasing elevation. The daily maximum air temperature occurs significantly later at the high-elevation site than that at the low elevation site because the air temperature at the high-elevation site is affected to a large extent by downward mixing of warm air near the ablation zone of the glacier during daytime. The air moisture content reflects the pronounced alternation of the wet and dry seasons, and the highest water vapor content is associated with the southwesterly Indian monsoon. The mean annual surface air temperature-elevation gradient is 0.72 +/- 0.01 degrees C (100 m)(-1), and also shows a pronounced seasonal signature. Mean annual air temperatures have increased by about 0.62 degrees C per decade over the last 49 years in this region; the greatest warming trend is observed in winter, the smallest in summer. Warmer conditions have been observed since the mid-1980s. Additional studies have shown a reduction in precipitation in the 1960s that resulted in a decrease in net snow accumulation. Therefore, accelerated retreat of the Rongbuk Glacier since the 1980s may be caused by rising air temperature and the decreased precipitation.",,,,,"ZHANG, TINGJUN/AAX-3662-2020; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018","Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; ZHANG, Tingjun/0000-0001-6974-9501",,,,,,,,,,,,,1523-0430,1938-4246,,,,FEB,2011,43,1,,,,,147,160,,10.1657/1938-4246-43.1.147,http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-43.1.147,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000288633400015,View Full Record in Web of Science

A tunable diode laser spectrophotometer (TDLS) was installed in the Hesse forest (northeast of France) early during the 2007 growing season to determine the seasonal and daily variability in delta C-13(FS). This method, based on the measurement of the absorption of an infrared laser emission at specific wave lengths of the (CO2)-C-13 and (CO2)-C-12, allows the continuous monitoring of the two isotopologues. The concentrations of the two isotopologues in F-S were continuously monitored from June to November 2007 using chamber method and Keeling plots drawn from nocturnal accumulation of CO2 below the canopy. These TDLS measurements and isotope ratio mass spectrometer based Keeling plots gave very similar values of delta C-13(FS), showing the reliability of the TDLS system in this context. Results were analysed with regard to seasonal and daily changes in climatic and edaphic variables and compared with the delta C-13 of CO2 respired by roots, litter and soil incubated under controlled conditions. Pronounced daily as well as seasonal variations in delta C-13(FS) were recorded (up to 1.5aEuro degrees). The range of variation of delta C-13(FS) was of the same order of magnitude at both diurnal and seasonal scales. delta C-13(FS) observed in the field fluctuated between values of litter and of root respiration recorded during incubation, suggesting that temporal (and probably spatial) variations were associated with changes in the relative contribution of the two compartments during the day and during the season.",,,,,"Epron, Daniel/B-5093-2011; MARRON, NICOLAS/J-5965-2013","Epron, Daniel/0000-0001-9451-3437; plain, caroline/0000-0002-3624-1127",,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,1573-5036,,,,MAY,2009,318,1-2,,,,,137,151,,10.1007/s11104-008-9824-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-008-9824-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000265538000013,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Crozier, L",,,,"Crozier, L",,,Warmer winters drive butterfly range expansion by increasing survivorship,ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"As the climate warms, many species are moving to higher latitudes and elevations. However, range shifts can be caused by many factors. These factors are unknown in most cases. The specific role of climate in these dynamics needs study to better predict future consequences of global warming. This case study evaluates whether warming,is driving the northward range expansion of a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris). Recently colonized areas have warmed 2-4degreesC over the past 50 years. To assess the importance of climate change for population persistence in these areas, I compared population dynamics at two locations (at the current range edge and just inside the range) that differ by 2-3degreesC. Population growth rate at these two locations over two years was positively correlated with January mean and annual mean temperatures. To determine whether larval overwinter survivorship could explain this correlation, I transplanted larvae over winter to both sites. Larval survivorship was very low at both locations, but significantly lower at the range edge, probably because lower lethal temperatures frequently occurred there. To estimate the direct effect of cold stress on larval survivorship, I applied a previously derived hazard-rate model based on laboratory experiments. With input from field-measured daily mean temperature, the model accurately predicted transplant survivorship at both locations over two winters. Combined results from population and larval transplant analyses indicate that winter temperatures directly affect the persistence of A. campestris at its northern range edge, and that winter warming was a prerequisite for this butterfly's range expansion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,JAN,2004,85,1,,,,,231,241,,10.1890/02-0607,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-0607,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000188869000025,View Full Record in Web of Science

Repeated measurements of daily field metabolic rate (FMR) were made on 11 Meadow Voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus Ord.) by means of the doubly labelled water technique. The objective was to quantify the individual consistency of FMR by calculating the repeatability of successive measures on the same individuals. One more general goal was to test whether FMRs are sufficiently repeatable to be convenient for field studies of natural selection. 2. Voles were all non-reproductive females, 5-7-months old. They were maintained individually in outdoor enclosures 25 m(2) and were injected 1-3 times with doubly labelled water. Two to six measures of daily FMR were thus obtained per individual (x=4.09, SD=1.51, n=11) over a period of 42 days in July and August 1994. 3. Body mass and rate of change in body mass accounted for 31.6% of the observed variation in FMR; ground-temperature variations had no significant effect on FMR, probably owing to the small range of temperatures experienced by voles. 4. Repeatability of mass-corrected log(10) FMR measurements was low (r=0.261). This low repeatability was very consistent with the results of a previous study on consistency of mass-specific daily energy expenditures of caged pouched mice. 5. A partition of the total variance observed in mass-corrected FMR showed that 63.0% of the variance originated from differences within individuals, 27.6% from differences among individuals, and 9.4% from measurement error. FMR was not consistently higher or lower on the first or second day of measurement, indicating no clear effect of handling stress. 6. A practical implication of these results is that single measurements of daily field metabolic rates are not necessarily a good predictor of the average 24 h energy budget for a given individual. On a more theoretical basis, these results indicate that, although the ability of an animal to manage its energy economics may largely determine its selective value, daily FMR seems to be a poor candidate variable to relate this ability to individual fitness in experimental studies. 7. We suggest that future studies of repeatability of FMR should concentrate on energetically constraining periods. This would allow further evaluation of the potential role of interindividual differences in FMR as a tool for understanding evolutionary pathways that shaped energy economics of animals.",,,,,"Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016","Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,DEC,1996,10,6,,,,,751,759,,10.2307/2390510,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2390510,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996WJ55200009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cyclic daily fattening routines are very common in wintering small wild birds, and are thought to be the consequence of a trade-off between different environmental and state-dependent factors. According to theory, these trajectories should range from accelerated (i.e. mass increases exponentially towards dusk) when mass-dependent predation costs are the most important cause of mortality risk, to decelerated (i.e. the rate of mass gain is highest at dawn and decreases afterward) when starvation is the greater risk. 2. We examine if geographically separate populations of coal tits, wintering in Scotland and central Spain under contrasting photoperiods, show differences in their strategies of daily mass regulation. We describe population differences in wild birds under natural conditions, and experimentally search for interpopulation variation in diurnal body mass increase under common, manipulated, photoperiod conditions (LD 9 : 15 h vs. 7 : 17 h), controlling for temperature, food availability, predator pressure and foraging arena. 3. Winter diurnal mass gain of wild coal tits was more delayed towards the latter part of the daylight period in central Spain (i.e. the locality with longer winter days) than in Scotland. In both localities, the pattern was linked to the average mass at dawn, with mass increasing more rapidly in lighter birds. However, under the controlled photoperiod situation the pattern of daily mass gain was similar in both populations. Diurnal body mass gain was more accelerated at the end of the day, and the increase in body mass in the first hour of the day was considerably lower under the long (9 h) than under the short (7 h) photoperiod in both populations. 4. Wintering coal tits show patterns of mass gain through the day that are compatible with current theories of the costs and benefits of fat storage, with birds at lower latitudes (with longer winter days) having a greater tendency to delay mass gain until late in the day. The experimental study revealed that these patterns are plastic, with birds responding directly to the photoperiod that they experience, suggesting that they are continually making fine-scale adjustments to energy reserves on the basis of both inherent (e.g. state-dependent) and extrinsic cues.",,,,,"Metcalfe, Neil B./C-5997-2009; Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008; Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016","Metcalfe, Neil B./0000-0002-1970-9349; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Vicente, Polo/0000-0002-0994-5372",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,SEP,2007,76,5,,,,,866,872,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01270.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01270.x,,,,,,,,17714264,,,,,WOS:000249088900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Eragrostis may further prevent successful Prosopis establishment by shortening the period over which moisture and soil temperatures are suitable for germination and survival of Prosopis seedlings following a pulse of summer rain.",,,,,"English, Nathan B/B-4615-2008","English, Nathan B/0000-0002-6936-8079",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2003,,30,,,,,188,192,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000189464800024,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, estimating daily SST with both high precision and high spatial completeness remains a challenge. This article attempts to solve this problem by merging two complementary daily SST products, that is, the 25 km-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) SST and 4 km-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST, using a genetic algorithm-assisted deep neural network model (GA-DNNM). The merged SST with a spatial resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 1 day is achieved. Experiments in the Asia and Indo-Pacific Ocean (AIPO) region in 2005 were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed method. Results showed that the spatial coverages of the original MODIS SST and AMSR-E SST are ranging from 25.0 to 48.1%, and 31.5 to 47.6%, respectively, while the merged SST achieves a spatial coverage ranging from 56.1 to 73.1%, with improvements ranging from 50.2 to 131.7% relative to the original MODIS SST. Comparisons with drifting buoy observations indicate that the merged SST is accurate, with an average bias of 0.006 degrees C and an average RMSE of 0.502 degrees C, in places where the MODIS SST data are missing before being merged in the AIPO area, and with an average bias of -0.082 degrees C, and an average RMSE of 0.603 degrees C for the merged SST in the whole study area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-665X,,,,OCT 27,2021,9,,,,,,,,748913,10.3389/fenvs.2021.748913,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.748913,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000717677900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a series of experiments, seeds were subjected to a range of temperatures (nine between 5 degreesC and 37 degreesC), light (white, red, far-red, and dark), and hydration (4-70 g H2O 100 g(-1) FW) during stratification for up to 80 d. Samples were germinated periodically at 25/15 degreesC or constant 15, 20, or 25 degreesC with a 12 h photoperiod to determine dormancy status. Dark-stratification was an alternative, but not equivalent dormancy release mechanism to dry after-ripening in annual ryegrass seeds. Dormancy release during dark-stratification caused a gradual increase in sensitivity to light, but germination in darkness remained negligible. Germination, but not dormancy release, was greater under fluctuating diurnal temperatures than the respective mean temperatures delivered constantly. Dormancy release rate was a positive linear function of dark-stratification temperature above a base temperature for dormancy release of 6.9 degreesC. Dormancy release at temperatures up to 30 degreesC could be described in terms of thermal dark-stratification time, but the rate of dormancy release was slower at less than or equal to15 degreesC (244 degreesCd/probit increase in germination) than greater than or equal to20 degreesC (208 degreesCd/probit). Stratification in red or white, but not far-red light, inhibited dormancy release, as did insufficient (<40 g H2O 100 g(-1) FW) seed hydration. The influence of dark-stratification on dormancy status in annual ryegrass seeds is discussed in terms of a hypothetical increase in available membrane-bound phytochrome receptors.",,,,,"Steadman, Kathryn/C-3401-2008","Steadman, Kathryn/0000-0001-7357-330X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,APR,2004,55,398,,,,,929,937,,10.1093/jxb/erh099,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erh099,,,,,,,,15020641,,,,,WOS:000220486400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The specific parameters required for a protective thermoprofile are poorly understood, because most studies test a limited range of thermoprofiles. For example, thermoprofiles with a wave profile may perform better than a square profile, but these two profiles are rarely compared. In this study, two developmental stages of the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, eye-pigmented pupae, and emergence-ready adults, were exposed to one of eight thermoprofiles for up to 8 weeks. All the thermoprofiles had a base of 6 degrees C and a peak temperature of either 12 degrees C or 18 degrees C. The duration at peak temperature varied depending on the shape of the thermoprofile, either square or wave form. Two other treatments acted as controls, a constant 6 degrees C and a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) with a base temperature of 6 degrees C that was interrupted daily by a single, 1-h pulse at 20 degrees C. Compared with constant 6 degrees C, all the test thermoprofiles significantly improved survival. Compared with the FTR control, the thermoprofiles with a peak temperature of 18 degrees C outperformed the 12 degrees C profiles. Bees in the eye-pigmented stage exposed to the 18 degrees C profiles separated into two groups based on the shape of the profile, with higher survival in the square profiles compared with the wave profiles. Bees in the emergence-ready stage exposed to 18 degrees C profiles all had significantly higher survival than bees in the FTR controls. Counter to expectations, the least ecologically relevant thermoprofiles (square) had the highest survival rates and blocked the development of sub-lethal effects (delayed emergence).",,,,,,"Rajamohan, Arun/0000-0003-1587-2891",,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,OCT,2019,59,4,,,,,1089,1102,,10.1093/icb/icz126,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icz126,,,,,,,,31270534,,,,,WOS:000491253900032,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results indicate that undisturbed community and soil respiration have apparent daily variation laws, daily variation patterns of respiration fluxes during different phenological phases are basically the same, and the variations of environmental factors only exert effect on CO2 emission intensities, while the effect on daily variation pattern of grassland CO2 emission fluxes is relatively small.

Fluctuating temperatures are likely to be more realistic, as they are ecologically more similar to what these arthropods experience in nature. Here, we compared the impact of 11 constant temperatures that ranged from 10 to 35 degrees C with fluctuating temperatures with the same corresponding mean temperature and an amplitude of 10 degrees C between high (12 h) and low (12 h) temperatures on the development and life history parameters of Tetranychus urticae under continuous light conditions.

Observations indicate an ELR of -4.5 K center dot km(-1) in the region, lower than the commonly used -6.5 K center dot km(-1). ERA5 ELR agrees with the observational estimates, with some overestimation in winter and limitations in the diurnal variability. The elevation correction of ERA5 temperature using different ELR showed the benefits of deriving ELR fields from ERA5 vertical profiles, when compared with a constant ELR. Simulations with the ECMWF land surface model, at 9-km resolution, driven by ERA5 using different ELR corrections showed the added value of the methodology, but the impact of different ELR corrections is limited. However, the validity of the downscaling method in reducing temperature to station altitude suggests that there is sufficient generality for application at kilometer and subkilometer resolutions. By comparing the estimated representativity errors of observations with reanalysis, the improvements from ERAI to ERA5 are mainly visible in the random component of the error.

The chief objectives were to determine the daily energy intake and growth of piscivorous brown trout (Salmo trutta), and to compare the observed values with those expected from models developed previously for brown trout feeding on freshwater invertebrates. Energy budgets for individual fish were obtained from experiments with 40 trout (initial live weight 250-318 g) bred from wild parents, and kept at five constant temperatures (5, 10, 13, 15, 18 degrees C) and 100% oxygen saturation. Each trout was fed to satiation on freshly killed sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) over a period of 42 days. 2. Energy intake (C-IN cal day(-1)) and growth (C-G cal day(-1)) were measured directly and energy losses (C-Q cal day(-1)) were estimated by difference (C-Q = C-IN - C-G). All three variables increased with temperature. A model previously used to predict the daily energy intake (C-IN(INV)) of trout feeding to satiation on invertebrates was adapted, by changing only one parameter, to provide an excellent model (R-2 = 0.998) for predicting the mean daily energy intake (C-IN(ST)) for the piscivorous trout. Values of C-IN(ST) were 58% (range 48-67%) higher than those for C-IN(INV). A simple model was also developed to estimate mean daily energy losses for piscivorous trout (R-2 = 0.999). Both models were combined to provide excellent estimates of the daily energy gain (growth) of the piscivorous trout, and this was about three times that for trout feeding on invertebrates. The optimum temperature for maximum growth in energy terms increased from 13.9 degrees C for trout feeding on invertebrates to 17.0 degrees C (range 16.6-17.4 degrees C) for piscivorous trout. 3. The models are basically an extension of those developed for trout feeding on invertebrates. They show clearly how energy intake, growth, and the optimum temperature for growth increase markedly when trout change their diet from invertebrates to fish. The implications of this are discussed and it is shown that, in theory, these increases should continue if a more energy-rich diet was utilised by the trout.",,,,,"Hurley, Margaret A/A-8875-2013","Hurley, Margaret A/0000-0002-2502-432X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,JUN,2000,44,2,,,,,237,245,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00560.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00560.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000087864300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Respiration from soil on raised nursery beds with fresh organic matter was compared with herbicide treated, flat soil in tree rows and the grass between the rows to study the contribution of soil and grass respiration to the CO2 balance of a fruit orchard.

However, it is difficult to acquire satellite LSTs with both high spatial and temporal resolutions due to tradeoffs between them. Thus, various algorithms/models have been developed to enhance the spatial or the temporal resolution of thermal infrared (TIR) data or LST, but rarely both. The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) is the widely-used data fusion algorithm for Landsat and MODIS imagery to produce Landsat-like surface reflectance. In order to extend the STARFM application over heterogeneous areas, an enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) approach was proposed by introducing a conversion coefficient and the spectral unmixing theory. The aim of this study is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the ESTARFM algorithm for generating ASTER-like daily LST by three approaches: simulated data, ground measurements and remote sensing products, respectively. The datasets of LST ground measurements, MODIS, and ASTER images were collected in an arid region of Northwest China during the first thematic HiWATER-Multi-Scale Observation Experiment on Evapotranspiration (MUSOEXE) over heterogeneous land surfaces in 2012 from May to September. Firstly, the results of the simulation test indicated that ESTARFM could accurately predict background with temperature variations, even coordinating with small ground objects and linear ground objects. Secondly, four temporal ASTER and MODIS data fusion LSTs (i.e., predicted ASTER-like LST products) were highly consistent with ASTER LST products. Here, the four correlation coefficients were greater than 0.92, root mean square error (RMSE) reached about 2 K and mean absolute error (MAE) ranged from 1.32 K to 1.73 K. Finally, the results of the ground measurement validation indicated that the overall accuracy was high (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.77 K), and the ESTARFM algorithm is a highly recommended method to assemble time series images at ASTER spatial resolution and MODIS temporal resolution due to LST estimation error less than 1 K. However, the ESTARFM method is also limited in predicting LST changes that have not been recorded in MODIS and/or ASTER pixels.",,,,,"Li, Hua/S-3644-2018; Weng, Qihao/Q-5323-2019; Weng, Qihao/L-6140-2013","Weng, Qihao/0000-0002-2498-0934; Yang, Guijun/0000-0002-6425-8321; Gao, Feng/0000-0002-1865-2846",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2072-4292,,,,JAN,2016,8,1,,,,,,,75,10.3390/rs8010075,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs8010075,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369494500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two experiments were designed: (1) at constant temperature regimens and (2) under diurnal temperature regimens ranging from 24-25 degrees C to 34-35 degrees C. At 24-25 degrees C egg hatching success was 98% at 48h, however at 34-35 degrees C egg hatching rates declined to 1.6% after 48h. Ae. aegypti larvae reared under constant temperature regimens showed pupation on day 4 with highest pupation occurring at 30 degrees C (78.4%) However, under diurnal temperature regimens, pupation began on day 4 but only at the higher temperatures of 30-35 degrees C. Under diurnal temperature regimens ranging from 24 degrees C to 35 degrees C significantly more females emerged at higher temperatures, than males. In contrast, at constant temperatures of 24-35 degrees C no significant difference in M/F ratios were observed. The body size of Ae. aegypti reared at constant temperature regimens was significantly larger than males and females larvae reared under diurnal temperature regimens of 25-30 degrees C. The results of this study are discussed in the context of changing or increasing water temperatures, seasonal changes in vector populations and vector competence. Using these key factors control strategies are recommended to manage vector populations as expected increases in temperatures impact the Caribbean region. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The device uses Pulse Width Modulation to control independent cooling and heating elements over a broad range of amperages, which minimizes or eliminates temperature overshoot and ensures precise and accurate temperature control (i.e., sensor accuracy = 0.1 degrees C; controller accuracy = 0.3 degrees C.). The device incorporates an internal clock for controlling temperature (and growth lights) concurrent with diurnal cycles, and it has an integrated Wi-Fi chip to transfer sensor data to a web-page, where data are displayed in real time. The device uses off-the-shelf parts and can be built for around $USD63. The controller can be integrated with other reported controllers (e.g., soil moisture and CO2) to produce an affordable multi-system controller necessary for complex factorial experiments, which hopefully can help to accel-erate our understanding about the impacts of climatic variables on plant performance.

This study examined how adaptive colony responses to changing ambient temperature are achieved through the in-nest workers' behavioral plasticity. We studied three Bombus huntii colonies in the laboratory. In the first experiment, we manipulated ambient temperature and recorded brood cell incubation and wing fanning by individually marked, known-age bees. The colonies maintained their nests closer to appropriate brood development temperatures (28 to 32 degrees C) when exposed to a range of ambient temperatures from 10.3 to 38.6 degrees C. Incubation activity was greater in cooler treatment conditions, whereas in the highest temperature treatment, some bees fanned and others moved off the brood. As the ambient temperature dropped, workers increased the duration of their incubating bouts, but, except at the highest temperature, the number of workers that incubated did not differ significantly among treatments. A subset of the bees incubated significantly more than their nest mates, some of which never incubated. Worker body size, but not age, was a good predictor of incubation rates, and smaller bees incubated at higher rates. In the second experiment, we removed the most actively incubating workers. Immediately after removals, the total colony incubation effort was lower than pre-removal levels, but incubation effort rebounded toward pre-removal levels after 24 h. The increased thermoregulatory demand after removals was met primarily by bees increasing their rates of incubation rather than by bees switching from a different task to incubation. We conclude that some B. huntii workers specialize on nest thermoregulation, and that changes in work rates are more important than task switching in meeting thermal challenges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,,,MAR,2007,61,5,,,,,783,792,,10.1007/s00265-006-0309-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-006-0309-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000244684500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The impact of uncertainties in the forcing irradiances on simulations of snow is evaluated in idealized modeling experiments. Two snow models of contrasting complexity, the Utah Energy Balance Model (UEB) and the Snow Thermal Model (SNTHERM), are forced with irradiances with prescribed errors of the structure and magnitude representative of those found in methods for estimating the downwelling irradiances. Relatively modest biases have substantial impacts on simulated snow water equivalent (SWE) and surface temperature (T-s) across a range of climates, whereas random noise at the daily scale has a negligible effect on modeled SWE and T-s. Shortwave biases have a smaller SWE impact, due to the influence of albedo, and T-s impact, due to their diurnal cycle, compared to equivalent longwave biases. Warmer sites exhibit greater sensitivity to errors when evaluated using SWE, while colder sites exhibit more sensitivity as evaluated using T-s. The two models displayed different sensitivity and responses to biases. The stability feedback in the turbulent fluxes explains differences in T-s between models in the negative longwave bias scenarios. When the models diverge during melt events, differences in the turbulent fluxes and internal energy change of the snow are found to be responsible. From this analysis, we suggest model evaluations use T-s in addition to SWE.",,,,,"Raleigh, Mark S/M-7687-2015; Hinkelman, Laura/L-8964-2016","Raleigh, Mark S/0000-0002-1303-3472; Hinkelman, Laura/0000-0001-6477-9648; Lapo, Karl/0000-0002-4637-2032",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,MAR,2015,51,3,,,,,1649,1670,,10.1002/2014WR016259,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014WR016259,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000353158800016,View Full Record in Web of Science

A total of 33 individuals (mass range = 0.03-0.86 kg) were acclimated for over 14 days at three temperature treatments (15 degrees, 23 degrees, 27 degrees C) spanning the seasonal water temperature variation in southern California. An average thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of 3.1 was estimated for the round stingray across the range of experimental temperatures. Estimations of size dependent Q(10) was 3.8 in juveniles while 2.6 in adults. Our model showed a negative relationship between this species mass-specific scaling exponent (b) and temperature (b = 0.99 at 15 degrees C, b = 0.86 at 23 degrees C, and b = 0.79 at 27 degrees C). Results indicate that the round stingray is relatively sensitive to the thermal fluctuations they experience in southern California. While adults with a relatively high metabolic Q(10) may optimize their daily net energy gain by exploiting the local thermal heterogeneity, a higher thermal sensitivity in juveniles could have adverse effects on the population fitness under a pervasive increase of ocean's temperature. Given that the scaling exponent can be affected by temperature, modeling studies should consider correcting for this effect when using scaling relationships as an input for more precise bioenergetic models under various thermal scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,JUL,2021,540,,,,,,,,151564,10.1016/j.jembe.2021.151564,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2021.151564,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000654239000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effects of agroforestry on microclimate and land surface temperatures (LST) remain largely unknown despite their central role in controlling abiotic and biotic factors and in buffering climate at a larger scale. We assessed spatial and temporal microclimate and LST variability in a biodiversity enrichment experiment, in which tree islands have been planted in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra (Indonesia). Four years after establishment of the experiment, we measured microclimate and LST using mini microclimate sensors and drone-recorded thermal images. We examined experimental effects of tree species richness (0, 1, 2, 3 or 6), plot size (25 m(2), 100 m(2), 400 m(2), 1600 m(2)) and stand structural complexity on microclimate and LST. Diurnal patterns showed ambient air temperature peaks and relative humidity (RH) minima at 3 pm, whereas diurnal soil temperatures peaked around 6 pm. The lowest LST were observed from oil palm canopy leaves and the highest from bare soils and understorey vegetation (including trees). Spatial and temporal ranges of ambient air temperature were smaller than LST ranges, and average ambient air temperature and LST were positively correlated. Tree species diversity had no overall significant effect neither on microclimate nor LST, but humidity was higher in planted tree islands compared to natural regeneration only. Smaller plots were characterized by higher mean air, soil and LST, compared to larger plots. Structurally complex plots were associated with low mean and maximum values of ambient air temperature, soil temperature and LST and high mean and minimum RH. Still, conditions were hotter and drier in several experimental plots compared to conventional oil palm plantations, considering a higher transpiration in the latest.

However, questions remain regarding flowering dates in the natural environment, such as the synchronous flowering of plants sown simultaneously at highly contrasting latitudes. The daily change in sunrise and sunset times is the cue for the flowering of trees and for the synchronization of moulting in birds at the equator. Sunrise and sunset also synchronize the cell circadian clock, which is involved in the regulation of flowering. The goal of this study was to update the photoperiodism model with knowledge acquired since its conception. Methods: A large dataset was gathered, including four 2-year series of monthly sowings of 28 sorghum varieties in Mali and two 1-year series of monthly sowings of eight rice varieties in the Philippines to compare with previously published monthly sowings in Japan and Malaysia, and data from sorghum breeders in France, Nicaragua and Colombia. An additive linear model of the duration in days to panicle initiation (PI) and flowering time using daylength and daily changes in sunrise and sunset times was implemented. Key Results: Simultaneous with the phyllochron, the duration to PI of field crops acclimated to the mean temperature at seedling emergence within the usual range of mean cropping temperatures. A unique additive linear model combining daylength and daily changes in sunrise and sunset hours was accurately fitted for any type of response in the duration to PI to the sowing date without any temperature input. Once calibrated on a complete and an incomplete monthly sowing series at two tropical latitudes, the model accurately predicted the duration to PI of the concerned varieties from the equatorial to the temperate zone. Conclusions: Including the daily changes in sunrise and sunset times in the updated photoperiodism model largely improved its accuracy at the latitude of each experiment.

Wesley",,,Elevated Salinity Rapidly Confers Cross-Tolerance to High Temperature in a Splash-Pool Copepod,INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Synopsis Accurate forecasting of organismal responses to climate change requires a deep mechanistic understanding of how physiology responds to present-day variation in the physical environment. However, the road to physiological enlightenment is fraught with complications: predictable environmental fluctuations of any single factor are often accompanied by substantial stochastic variation and rare extreme events, and several factors may interact to affect physiology. Lacking sufficient knowledge of temporal patterns of co-variation in multiple environmental stressors, biologists struggle to design and implement realistic and relevant laboratory experiments. In this study, we directly address these issues, using measurements of the thermal tolerance of freshly collected animals and long-term field records of environmental conditions to explore how the splash-pool copepod Tigriopus californicus adjusts its physiology as its environment changes. Salinity and daily maximum temperature-two dominant environmental stressors experienced by T. californicus-are extraordinarily variable and unpredictable more than 2-3 days in advance. However, they substantially co-vary such that when temperature is high salinity is also likely to be high. Copepods appear to take advantage of this correlation: median lethal temperature of field-collected copepods increases by 7.5 degrees C over a roughly 120 parts-per-thousand range of ambient salinity. Complementary laboratory experiments show that exposure to a single sublethal thermal event or to an abrupt shift in salinity also elicits rapid augmentation of heat tolerance via physiological plasticity, although the effect of salinity dwarfs that of temperature. These results suggest that T. californicus's physiology keeps pace with the rapid, unpredictable fluctuations of its hypervariable physical environment by responding to the cues provided by recent sublethal stress and, more importantly, by leveraging the mechanistic cross-talk between responses to salinity and heat stress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2517-4843,,,,AUG 22,2022,4,1,,,,,,,obac037,10.1093/iob/obac037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/iob/obac037,,,,,,,,36003414,,,,,WOS:000842650900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We sampled once a month, in June, July and August, every sixth hour during 24 h. We found that copepods experience a change in pH of more than 0.5 units and 5 degrees C change in temperature during migration.

Relatively large variations in the spatial temperature distribution were found, and they were higher in the vertical direction than in the longitudinal direction.

The AOZ temperature correlated better with temperatures measured at 0.7 m or 1.5 m height in the same pen than with temperatures measured in the AOZ at other pens. The analyses show that a proportional-integral based control system effectively counteracts the effects of outdoor wind conditions, and the control system is capable of maintaining the defined optimal temperature at the measurement height.

In an experimental arena with zones at different climatic conditions, starved R. prolixus nymphs prefer a cooler and more humid zone, stopping there more often and for longer periods. This is probably a behavioural adaptation to limit water loss and reduce metabolic rate. In the Venezuelan State of Portuguesa, temperature and humidity were monitored in three kinds of potential refugia during the dry season: (i) in a palm roof; (ii) in a crack of the wall of a house; and (iii) in a palm tree crown. Fluctuations in temperature and saturation deficit are not very different inside and outside the palm roof except during a few hours of the day when the sun is at its zenith. In the crack of the wall, the diurnal temperature range is reduced to 6.5 degrees C compared with 12.4 degrees C outside, and the saturation deficit varies by only 7.6 hPa compared with 28.6 hPa outside. In the palm tree crown, the daily temperature range is only 4.2 degrees C compared with 13.8 degrees C outside, and the saturation deficit is permanently < 5 hPa. The micro-climatic conditions in the palm tree crown would appear to be ideal for starving R. prolixus, but this kind of refugium generally harbours low densities of bugs, probably related to a combination of predation, pathogens and lower mean temperature within the crown.

This study used the yield results from a long-term field experiment (1979-2012) at Luancheng Experimental Station in the central part of the North China Plain (NCP) to analyze the seasonal yield variation of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under the condition of sufficient water supply. The yield change of winter wheat over the last 33 growing seasons was divided into three time periods: the 1980s, the 1990s, and the years of 2001-2012. The grain yield of winter wheat during the 1980s was relative stable. During the 1990s, the annual yield of this crop was continuously increased by 193 kg/ha/year (P < 0.01). While for the past 12 years, yield of winter wheat was maintained at relative higher level, but with larger seasonal yield variation than that back in 1980s. CERES-Wheat model was calibrated and was used to verify the effects of management practices on grain yield. Seven scenarios were simulated with and without improvements in management. The simulated results show that the yield of winter wheat was decreased by 5.3% during 1990s and by 9.2% during the recent 12 seasons, compared with that during 1980s, under the scenario that the yield of winter wheat was solely affected by weather. Seasonal yield variation caused by weather factors was around -39% to 20%, indicating the great effects of weather on yearly yield variation. Yield improvement by cultivars was around 24.7% during 1990s and 52.0% during the recent 12 seasons compared with that during 1980s. The yield improvement by the increase in soil fertility and chemical fertilizer input was 7.4% and 6.8% during the two periods, respectively. The initial higher soil fertility and chemical fertilizer input might be the reasons that the responses of crop production to the further increase in chemical fertilizer were small during the simulation period. Correlation analysis of the grain yield from the field measured data with weather factors showed that sunshine hours and diurnal temperature difference (DTR) were positively, and relative humidity was negatively related to grain yield of winter wheat. The climatic change trends in this area showed that the DTR and sunshine hours were declining. This type of climatic change trend might further negatively affect winter wheat production in the future. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The goats were released to graze during the day and then returned to an enclosed shed. The type of goat management was considered as semi-extensive. Direct observation was used to simulate the total distance walked, the vertical ascent or descent, and to quantify other grazing activities. Data on activities on range and distance travelled were taken on 3 days in each season. The energy expenditure of locomotion was calculated from the horizontal and vertical components of travel and the corresponding costs, which had been previously obtained by calorimetry. There was no significant seasonal effect on period devoted to specific activities on range (P>0.05). However, significant changes in the estimated daily energy expenditure and extra energy expenditure due to locomotion of the animals at pasture were found in different seasons (P<0.05). Grazing and walking were the primary activities of goats throughout the study, accounting for 51.7 and 42.0% of the animals' daily period on range, respectively. Daily travelled distances by goats on range fluctuated from 12,777 m in summer to 8,100 m in autumn, with an annual average of 9,954 m, which represents a mean speed of 20.8 m/min calculated over the whole period on range. The mean annual vertical ascent or descent was 500 m. Estimated heat production due to locomotion ranged from 130.9 to 88.5 kJ/kg(0.75) per day in summer and autumn respectively. These values account for an increased metabolizable energy (ME) requirement at pasture above maintenance of 46.6 and 31.6%, respectively, assuming a ME requirement for maintenance of 401 kJ/kg(0.75) per day for the restrained goat.",,,,,,"Barroso, Fernando/0000-0001-8828-9686",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-409X,,,,,SEP,1999,52,5,,,,,431,435,,10.2307/4003768,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4003768,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082837300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Madagascar is a particularly challenging environment because climatic conditions seem less predictable than in comparative ecosystems in other parts of the world. We used the reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus) from the most unpredictable environment in Madagascar as a model to investigate the flexibility of energy saving strategies to cope with the unpredictability of their habitat. For this we measured T-sk of free-ranging mouse lemurs throughout the year using temperature data loggers. M. griseorufus showed a very strong seasonal as well as an individual flexibility in thermoregulation. During the rainy season all M. griseorufus remained normothermic. At the beginning of the dry season individuals started to exhibit different energy saving strategies: irregular short torpor bouts, regular daily torpor, prolonged torpor of a few days, and hibernation over several weeks. The accumulation of sufficient seasonal body fat was the crucial factor determining the thermal behavior of individuals. The observed intraspecific and sex independent variation in thermoregulatory patterns within one population inhabiting the same small geographical area is exceptional and gives M. griseorufus the ability to respond to current environmental as well as individual conditions. This thermal plasticity might be seen as a key to success and survival for M. griseorufus in an extremely unpredictable environment.",,,,,"Dausmann, Kathrin/E-9270-2017; Ganzhorn, Joerg/AAO-6955-2020","Ganzhorn, Joerg/0000-0003-1395-9758",,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,1432-136X,,,,JAN,2011,181,1,,,,,165,173,,10.1007/s00360-010-0507-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-010-0507-5,,,,,,,,20717683,,,,,WOS:000286341400015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Petunia 'Easy Wave Coral Reef' and 'Wave Purple' were grown in glass-glazed greenhouses at 14-23 degrees C Or 14-26 degrees C and under 4-19 mol m(-2) d(-1) with a 16-h photoperiod. The flower developmental rate was predicted using a model that included a linear MDT function with a base temperature multiplied by an exponential MDLI saturation function. The flower developmental rate increased and time to flower decreased as MDT increased within the temperature range studied. For example, under a MDLI of 12 mol m(-2) d(-1), as MDT increased from 14 to 23 degrees C, time to flower of 'Easy Wave Coral Reef' and 'Wave Purple' decreased from 51 to 22d and 62 to 30d, respectively. Flower developmental rate increased as MDLI increased until saturation at 14.1-14.4 mol m(-2) d(-1). Nonlinear models were generated for effects of MDT and MDLI on flower bud number and plant height at flowering. The number of flower buds at flowering increased as MDT decreased and MDLI increased. For example, at an MDT of 14 degrees C with 18 mol m(-2) d(-1), plants had 2.5-2.9 times more flower buds than those grown at 23 degrees C and 4 mol m(-2) d(-1). Models were validated with an independent data set, and the predicted time to flower, flower bud number, and plant height were within +/- 7 d, +/- 20 flowers, and +/- 4 cm, respectively, for 96-100%, 62-87%, and 93-100% of the observations, respectively. The models could be used during greenhouse crop production to improve scheduling and predict plant quality of these petunia cultivars. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Mean initial weights of 0.22-, 0.73-, 1.56- and 18.9-g fish, previously habituated to a dry diet, were used in experiments lasting between 14 and 30 days, depending on initial body weight. Daily feeding levels ranged from 2% to 20% of biomass in 0.22-g fish, from 1% to 8% in 0.73-g fish, from 1% to 10% of biomass in 1.56-g fish and from 0.3% to 3% of biomass for 18.9-g fish. Feeding levels significantly affected survival of perch, except in experiment 4 with large juveniles (18.9). In experiments 2 and 3 (with 0.73- and 1.56-g fish, respectively), cannibalism was significantly higher at the lowest feeding level (1% biomass day (-1)), while starvation seemed to be the major cause of death in experiment 1 with 0.22-g fish. Values of specific growth rate (SGR) plotted against daily food ration allowed the maintenance, optimum and maximum feeding levels to be determined, according to the Brett and Grove's model.

In this study, we describe I) interactions between soil CO2 concentration, temperature, soil water content and root respiration, and II) the effect of short-term fluctuations of these three environmental factors on the relation between actual and observed root respiration rates. We designed an automated, open gas-exchange system that allows continuous measurements on 12 chambers with intact roots in soil. By using three distinct chamber designs with each a different path for the air flow, we were able to measure root respiration over a 50-fold range of soil CO2 concentrations (400 to 25000 ppm) and to separate the effect of irrigation on observed vs. actual root respiration rate. All respiration measurements were made on one-year-old citrus seedlings in sterilized sandy soil with minimal organic material. Root respiration was strongly affected by diurnal fluctuations in temperature (Q(10) = 2), which agrees well with the literature. In contrast to earlier findings for Douglas-fir (Qi et al., 1994), root respiration rates of citrus were not affected by soil CO2 concentrations (400 to 25000 ppm CO2; pH around 6). Soil CO2 was strongly affected by soil water content but not by respiration measurements, unless the air flow for root respiration measurements was directed through the soil. The latter method of measuring root respiration reduced soil CO2 concentration to that of incoming air. Irrigation caused a temporary reduction in CO2 diffusion, decreasing the observed respiration rates obtained by techniques that depended on diffusion. This apparent drop in respiration rate did not occur if the air flow was directed through the soil. Our dynamic data are used to indicate the optimal method of measuring root respiration in soil, in relation to the objectives and limitations of the experimental conditions.",,,,,"Eissenstat, David/AAE-2793-2020; Bouma, Tjeerd J/A-9841-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,,,,,AUG,1997,195,2,,,,,221,232,,10.1023/A:1004278421334,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004278421334,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997YE36400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The diurnal variation in methane emission flux was basically consistent with daily temperature change, and methane emission flux reached a peak from 12 noon to 2 p.m. But the seasonal variation patterns of methane emission flux were not completely consistent between early rice and late rice. The peak of methane emission flux for early rice and late rice, respectively, appeared in the young panicle differentiation stage and the full tillering stage. Moreover, the seasonal fluctuation range of methane emission flux from early rice was smaller than that from late rice, and the total amount of methane emission from late rice also significantly higher than that from early rice.

Now it has widely naturalized and is exhibiting increasing invasiveness in South China. As this species often dominates bare ground, a habitat characterized by extreme fluctuation in temperature and water, it is reasonable to hypothesize that it has special adaptations to high temperature and water stress. Using laboratory experiments to simulate these stresses, this study investigated the response of Mexican sunflower seed germination to temperature and water stress, and compared these responses with those previously reported for another invasive, bamboo piper, which is confined to relatively cool and moist habitats in Xishuangbanna. As expected, Mexican sunflower seeds exhibited higher tolerance to these stresses than bamboo piper. Germination of Mexican sunflower seeds was highest at 15-30 degrees C, but significant numbers of seeds germinated and formed seedlings at 10 degrees C and 35 degrees C, at which no bamboo piper seeds formed seedlings, indicating a wider temperature range for germination than the latter. Roughly half the seeds survived 240 h continuous heat treatment and up to 15 h daily periodical heat treatment at 40 degrees C, while bamboo piper seeds were mostly killed by these treatments. About 20% of Mexican sunflower but no bamboo piper seeds germinated after heat treatment for 30 min at 80 degrees C. Germination was completely inhibited in bamboo piper seeds at -0.6 mPa, while 20-60% of Mexican sunflower seeds germinated depending on PEG or NaCl as osmoticum. This higher tolerance in Mexican sunflower seeds accords with its stronger invasiveness in this area. This comparison between two plant invaders demonstrates that invasiveness is not an all-or-nothing situation, and that adaptation to local habitats is a critical determinant of successful invasiveness for an alien plant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,OCT 28,2015,10,10,,,,,,,e0141567,10.1371/journal.pone.0141567,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141567,,,,,,,,26509675,,,,,WOS:000363918100104,View Full Record in Web of Science

Glass-phase American eels Anguilla rostrata (Lesueur), which had been captured near the mouth of an estuary in Maine, USA, prior to freshwater exposure, deposited increments at a daily rate at ambient temperature and salinity in a field and laboratory study. The regression for glass eels not possessing a transition ring was: I = 0.976(D - 1) + 0.434, where I is the number of otolith increments distal to a fluorescent mark placed on the otolith at the beginning of the experiment, and D is the number of days in the experiment, which ranged from 7 to 49. The slope was not significantly different than 1. Unexpectedly, many glass eels deposited the transition ring during the experiment, although this ring had previously been thought to mark entry into fresh water. The regression for these glass eels was: I = 0.961(D - 1) - 3.880, and the slope was not significantly different than 1. The negative intercept suggests that approximately il days were lost from the otolith record during deposition of the ring. This study demonstrated daily deposition of increments prior to freshwater exposure and demonstrated that deposition of the transition ring is not linked to freshwater entry.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were measured by static chambers in three growing seasons (2015-18) in the framework of a long-term experiment of different tillage systems established in 2002. Tillage management remained the same throughout the trial, while chemical weed control was carried out in response to the actual weed content. Environmental variables were monitored, including the soil total organic carbon (TOC) content, water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC), soil temperature and water content. Total CO2 emission, as mean of the studied seasons, did not significantly differ between NT and RT (2.35 and 2.24 t CO2-C ha(-1) for NT and RT, respectively), although differences were found at the growth cycle scale. Total annual CO2 emission from NT was stable, being the same along the three cycles, while total RT CO2 emission decreased from the first to the third cycle. The TOC content was almost stable, while WEOC showed large variability that could explain the variability of CO2 emissions for RT over short time scales and was probably because of weed control in the middle of the second growing cycle. CO2 emissions were driven by soil water content via the impact on water filled pore space, and soil temperature range, that is daily maximum minus minimum temperature.

Using a common-garden experimental protocol, we investigated how bidirectional temperature change can affect survival and growth of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and whether the survival and growth responses differ between two populations, using four thermal-variability treatments (mean: 10 degrees C; range: 7-13 degrees C): (i) constancy; (ii) cyclical fluctuations every two days; (iii) low stochasticity (random changes every 2 days); (iv) high stochasticity (random changes daily). Recently hatched individuals were monitored under thermal variability (6 weeks) and a subsequent one-month period of thermal constancy. We found that variability can positively influence survival, relative to thermal constancy, but negatively affect growth. The observations reported here can be interpreted within the context of Jensen's Inequality (performance at average conditions is unequal to average performance across a range of conditions).

The November 1984 and April 1987 periods coincided with the TROPIC HEAT and TROPIC HEAT-2 experiments, during which direct measurements of turbulent dissipation rates were made near the mooring site. In May-June 1987, a special set of moored time series were collected between 30-m and 61-m depth with 1-minute temporal resolution in addition to standard measurements at 15-minute resolution. The high-resolution data indicated the existence of a diurnal cycle in variance that was most pronounced at frequencies of 10-30 cph and that was coherent over the 3 1 -m extent of the vertical array. It is likely that this diurnal cycle in variance was due in part to internal waves remotely generated at the base of the nighttime mixed layer and that the appearance of internal waves in the thermocline at frequencies higher than the local Vaisala frequency (about 2-7 cph) in May-June 1987 was due to Doppler shifting by the Equatorial Undercurrent. It is also likely that part of the observed diurnal cycle in variance was due to local shear instabilities in the Equatorial Undercurrent that may have been triggered by the diurnally modulated internal wave field. More coarsely resolved 15-minute moored time-series data from November 1984, April 1987, and May-June 1987 indicated the presence of a diurnal cycle after averaging over at least 30 days of data. Largest diurnal ranges in temperature and vertical displacement variance were typically observed in November 1984 when wind speed, zonal wind stress, and mean vertical shear were largest and when the mean gradient Richardson number was smallest. The diurnal cycle in turbulent dissipation rate had a larger amplitude in November 1984 than in April 1987, consistent with a dynamical connection between internal wave variability and turbulence in the equatorial thermocline.",,,,,"McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016","McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,,,,,NOV,1992,22,11,,,,,1317,1329,,10.1175/1520-0485(1992)022<1317:DCOIWV>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(1992)022<1317:DCOIWV>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JZ29700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This experiment aims to global gradual deforestation and has two phases. The first phase, defined as the pre-industrial period (1850-1899) with constant unchangeable anthropogenic impact. For this period deforestation modelled with further replacement with grass cover with a linear trend 400000 km(2)/yr or 20 million km2 per 50 years in general. The second phase is next 30 years with no significant changes in forest cover (1900-1929). For conducting this research the data of several global climate models were applied. The results of analysis have demonstrated that a partial deforestation with grass substitution influences the surface reflectivity or albedo and redistribution of shortwave radiative fluxes. In turn, it provokes changes in thermal regime. It was found that the most significant changes in surface reflectivity and the strongest correlation coefficients between albedo and deforestation are in the winter season due to the presence of snow cover. As a result, statistical significant increase of albedo is with maximum values up to 24 %/50 years in some grids in winter. Then in the summer season maximal changes are up to 2.7 %/50 years due to small differences between forest and grass albedos. As a consequence, changes in albedo cause changes in surface and air temperature regimes. Strong dependencies were found in winter between changes in albedo and temperatures with maximum temperature decrease -2.5...-2.0 %/50 years. In warm season correlations are weaker in comparison to cold season, but nevertheless, temperatures decrease also take place with maximum values -2.0.-1.5 %/50 years. The analysis between deforestation and daily air temperature range has shown that particularly in winter season there is an increase of 0.5...1.5 %/50 years, whereas such tendency is not observed in warm season. Calculations of year air temperature range demonstrated controversial results among climate models, as follows it is hard to make a conclusion about the contribution of forest cover reduction to changes in this index. It was revealed, that global climate models with higher resolution are more sensitive to changes in albedo and, as a consequence to other characteristics than models with coarse ones. It should be noticed that obtained results concern pre-industrial period with minimal anthropogenic impact, when observed a stable snow cover in winter in Ukraine. In the current climate change with significant warming and reduction of snow season duration deforestation can have opposite effects on radiative and thermal regimes that require further studying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0203-3100,2524-1052,,,,,2021,43,3,,,,,135,160,,10.24028/gzh.v43i3.236385,http://dx.doi.org/10.24028/gzh.v43i3.236385,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000670656300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the literature provides only a few studies assessing its effect on their cognitive abilities. We tested the effect of temperature on the spatial learning rate of zebrafish by comparing the daily rate of change in the number of fish choosing the correct arm first and behavioural performance (i.e., distance travelled, time needed to locate the daily food reward and swimming speed) in two temperatures (21 and 31 degrees C) in 7 successive sessions. The daily rate of change in behavioural performance was expressed as the percentage difference between the value in a given session and the value in the previous session. Two experiments were performed in a T-maze with single feeders in the arms, one empty and the other with a food reward. In each of the experiments, we used 10 naive fish, which were placed in the T-maze individually once a day. The fish were fed between sessions to avoid increasing differences in hunger levels and, in turn, increasing the differences in motivation to find the food between the temperature treatments. The results revealed that the learning rate was greater at the higher temperature, which was apparent in a greater percentage reduction in the time and distance travelled needed to locate the daily food reward between successive sessions at the higher temperature than at the lower temperature. The results show there was a significant effect of temperature on the daily rate of change in the number of fish choosing the correct arm, distance travelled and time needed to locate the daily food reward, which may be attributed to the positive effect of temperature on learning rate, and may indicate the importance of temperature for the cognitive testing of zebrafish.",,,,,"Maszczyk, Piotr/AAN-4661-2020","Maszczyk, Piotr/0000-0002-1738-419X; Babkiewicz, Ewa/0000-0003-2398-8448; Gliwicz, Zbigniew Maciej/0000-0002-6628-4785",,,,,,,,,,,,,0179-1613,1439-0310,,,,AUG,2021,127,8,,,,,632,642,,10.1111/eth.13197,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.13197,,JUN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659437700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mark-recapture studies indicated that this primate species might also hibernate for several weeks, although physiological evidence is lacking. In the present study, we investigated patterns of body temperature in two free-ranging M. murinus during the austral winter using temperature-sensitive data loggers implanted subdermally. One lemur hibernated and remained inactive for 4 weeks. During this time, body temperature followed the ambient temperature passively with a minimum body temperature of 11.5A degrees C, interrupted by irregular arousals to normothermic levels. Under the same conditions, the second individual displayed only short bouts of torpor in the early morning hours but maintained stable normothermic body temperatures throughout its nocturnal activity. Reduction of body temperature was less pronounced in the mouse lemur that utilized short bouts of torpor with a minimum value of 27A degrees C.

Seeds germinate over a range of temperatures within which there is an optimum temperature, with thresholds above and below which no germination occurs. Rapid changes in temperature associated with global warming may cause a disconnect between temperatures a seed experiences and temperatures over which germination can occur. This paper explores the temperature dimension of the germination niche of eight herbaceous species from South West Western Australia as part of a broader assessment of endemic native species at risk of decline under global warming. The data obtained from germination studies on a temperature gradient plate were used to populate models to predict optimum germination responses ( mean time to germination, germination timing and success) under current (1950-2000 averages) and future (2070 high greenhouse gas emission) temperature scenarios. The species exhibited a mix of germination responses, often with high tolerance to high diurnal temperatures. A number of species did not reach their full potential within the experimental period, indicating the presence of dormancy not overcome due to temperature alone. Modelling revealed that for some species the opportunity for germination may decline due to rising temperatures, but for others there would be little change, though a shift in germination timing may be expected. This approach to identifying extinction risk contributes tangibly to efforts to predict plant responses to environmental change and can help prioritize species for management actions, direct limited resources towards further investigations and supplement bioclimatic modelling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1211-9520,1874-9348,,,,JUN,2019,54,1-2,,,,,29,42,,10.1007/s12224-019-09335-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12224-019-09335-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000510731000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experiments were performed in germination chambers under constant temperatures of 10-40 degrees C (intervals of 5 degrees C), with a 12-h photoperiod, as well as in continuous darkness. All species studied had small seeds with mass varying from 0.06 to 1.21 mg. Most species required light for germination, displaying high germinability in the range of 15-40 degrees C; some species, however, germinated in the absence of light at the highest temperatures (35 and 40 degrees C). The sizes and masses of the seeds showed significant linear correlations, but light sensitivity was not related to these seed characteristics. The responses observed suggest that light requirement for germination, associated with the small sizes of Vellozia spp. seeds, contribute to the formation of persistent seed banks. The observed tolerance of these seeds to a wide range of germination temperatures is consistent with the large daily temperature fluctuations experienced in campos rupestres sites, although these seed characteristics cannot by themselves explain the high degree of endemism or the restricted distributions observed among the species examined.",,,,,"Garcia, Queila S/B-5429-2014","Garcia, Queila S/0000-0002-7137-788X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-2585,1475-2735,,,,MAR,2013,23,1,,,,,67,74,,10.1017/S0960258512000256,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0960258512000256,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000314426100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this species the incidence of diapause decreased within the range from 25 to 33 degrees C. The long day prevented diapause only within particular temperature limits, which were species specific. In species with typical long-day photoperiodic response (C. perla, C. septempunctata and Chrysoperla carnea) daily temperature fluctuations were less favourable to diapause induction than constant mean temperature. In C. phyllochroma and C. abbreviata the similar high incidence of diapausing prepupae was induced both by daily natural thermoperiods and constant mean temperature. In experiments carried out under 12-h thermophase: 12-h cryophase conditions it was revealed that photo-thermoperiodic responses of C. phyllochroma were significantly dependent on cryophase temperature, whereas diapause of C. perla was determined mainly by photoperiod.

We compared effects of elevated CO2 with those of daytime warming on acclimation of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) to freezing temperatures under field conditions. Reduction in stomatal conductance g(c) under elevated CO2 was shown to cause leaf temperature to increase by up to 3 degrees C. In this study, this increase in leaf temperature was simulated under ambient CO2 conditions by using a free air temperature increase (FATI) system to warm snow gum leaves during daytime, thereby increasing the diurnal range in temperature without affecting temperature minima. Acclimation to freezing temperatures was assessed using measures of electrolyte leakage and photosynthetic efficiency of leaf discs exposed to different nadir temperatures. Here, we show that both elevated CO2 and daytime warming delayed acclimation to freezing temperatures for 2-3 weeks after which time freeze tolerance of the treated plants in both the FATI and open top chamber (OTC) experiments did not differ from control plants. Our results support the hypothesis that delayed development of freezing tolerance under elevated CO2 is because of higher daytime leaf temperatures under elevated CO2.

High heating costs have motivated growers to improve the efficiency of crop production to minimize energy inputs. We performed greenhouse experiments with Petunia xhybrida 'Dreams Neon Rose' and Tagetes patula 'Janie Flame' to understand how mean daily temperature (MDT) and photosynthetic daily light integral (DLI) influence plant development. This information was then used to determine how the production environment and crop timing influence greenhouse energy consumption for heating on a per-crop basis. Seedlings of each species were grown in an environmental growth chamber at an MDT of 20.4 degrees C with a DLI of 10 mol m(-2) d(-1) and under a 16-h photoperiod. After 19 to 32 d from seed sow, seedlings were transplanted into 10-cm pots and grown in glass-glazed greenhouses at constant air temperature set points of 14, 17, 20, 23, or 26 degrees C and under a 16-h photoperiod provided by high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps. At each temperature, plants were grown under two DLI treatments provided by the use of a shade curtain and different intensities of supplemental lighting from HPS lamps. Time to flower in Petunia decreased from 43 to 17 d as MDT and DLI increased from 14 degrees C and 4 mol m(-2) d(-1) to 26 degrees C and 16 mol.m(-2) d(-1). In Tagetes, time to flower ranged from 17 to 38 d. A decision-support software (Virtual Grower) was used to estimate energy consumption at different locations in the United States based on the predicted crop production durations at different MDTs and DLIs. For example, the predicted energy cost for greenhouse heating to produce a Petunia crop in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA for a 1 April finish date was 8% lower when grown at an MDT of 20 degrees C compared to that at 14 degrees C.

The willow beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis is ideal for such studies. It lives in California's Sierra Nevada on the southern edge of its worldwide range. Beetles experience elevated air temperatures during summertime egg laying and larval development. Exposure to these temperatures causes physiological stress, which may reduce reproductive success and endanger populations. The glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is a marker of temperature adaptation in C. aeneicollis. PGI allele frequency varies across a latitudinal gradient: allele 1 is common in Rock Creek (RC), which is cooler and to the north, and allele 4 is common in Big Pine Creek (BPC), which is warmer and to the south. In populations that are intermediate in geography and climate (e. g., Bishop Creek [BC]), PGI-4 frequency increases from north to south such that alleles 1 and 4 are in relatively equal frequency in southern BC. Over the past decade, Sierra Nevada beetle populations have colonized high elevations and have become extinct at lower elevations where they were once common. In BC, the magnitude of PGI allele frequency fluctuations among life-history stages is related to maximal air temperature, with the frequency of PGI-4 increasing after the hottest part of summer. To identify mechanisms that may cause shifts in PGI allele frequency, we measured metabolic rate and fecundity for beetles collected at BC. Metabolic rate of males and females was measured at 20 degrees and 36 degrees C using flow-through respirometry. To measure laboratory fecundity, mating pairs were acclimated for 4 h each afternoon at a control temperature (20 degrees C) or at mildly elevated temperatures (26 degrees or 32 degrees C) and number of eggs laid was counted daily for 24 d, after which tissue levels of 70-kD heat shock proteins (Hsp70) were determined. Previous studies had demonstrated differences in Hsp70 expression among PGI genotypes at these temperatures. To measure field fecundity, mating pairs from BC were transplanted to similar elevations in BPC, BC, and RC and were monitored in situ for 24 d. Metabolic rate was higher for PGI 4-4 genotypes than for PGI 1-4 or PGI 1-1 individuals at 36 degrees C but not at 20 degrees C. In contrast, laboratory fecundity was greatest for females possessing PGI-1, independent of acclimation temperature. At the end of the laboratory fecundity experiment, Hsp70 expression was positively related to fecundity, suggesting minimal reproductive cost of upregulation of heat shock proteins in response to mild heat stress. In the field, fecundity was highest for PGI 1-1 and PGI 1-4 individuals in RC and PGI 4-4 individuals in BPC and was similar for all genotypes in BC. Thus, fecundity in nature was greatest for the genotypes that were most common in each area. Taken together, data reported here suggest that hot, dry summers in the Sierra Nevada may result in an increase in frequency of the PGI-4 allele and shifts to higher elevations for C. aeneicollis populations.",,,,,"Dahlhoff, Elizabeth/AAI-1636-2020; Gibbs, Allen G/G-6939-2014; Gibbs, Allen/D-6968-2011","Dahlhoff, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7019-5005; Gibbs, Allen G/0000-0001-5233-2056; Rank, Nathan/0000-0001-8383-1501; Deiner, Kristy/0000-0001-9755-3223",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,,,,,NOV-DEC,2008,81,6,,,,,718,732,,10.1086/590165,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/590165,,,,,,,,18956974,,,,,WOS:000260547400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The addition of canopy gaps has been suggested as a management tool to accelerate development of riparian forest complexity, create stream light conditions that mimic those in late successional forests, and enhance in-stream productivity. Although gaps form naturally in late-successional forests, explicitly adding gaps is a concern because the increases in light that accompany a canopy gap may have the potential to increases stream temperature, which is an important ecological driver and regulatory metric in streams. The goal of this study was to determine whether and to what degree riparian forest canopy gaps that reflect localized disturbance events (mortality of one to a few dominant canopy trees) affect stream temperatures. We created experimental gaps in young regenerating riparian forests along six replicate headwater streams in western Oregon. Gaps increased light along 90 m study reaches by 3.91 (+/- 1.63) moles of photons m(-2) day(-1), similar to that of a naturally occurring gap in a late-successional forest. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact study design, we assessed stream temperature by tracking multiple responses in each reach including: maximum seven day moving average of daily maximums (T-7DayMax), maximum seven day moving average of daily means (T-7DayMean), daily maximum, and mean summer temperatures, as well as within-reach (every 30 m) responses, and downstream recovery. Over a 40-day period in summer (July 22nd August 30th), the mean response in T-7DayMax across the six replicate streams was 0.21 degrees C +/- 0.12, and the mean response in T-7DayMean was 0.15 degrees C +/- 0.14. Although the mean response in T-7DayMax (a key regulatory metric) was small, changes varied across individual study streams, and the magnitude of the relative increase in stream T-7DayMax as a result of the canopy gap was strongly negatively correlated with stream size. T-7DayMax was not correlated with the size of the canopy opening or change in reach-scale light availability (within the range of gap sizes from 514 m(2) to 1,374 m(2) (0.05 to 0.14 ha)). Overall, riparian forest canopy gaps have the potential to increase stream temperatures, but in the western Cascade Mountain headwaters studied here, gap effects were small (all < 0.5 degrees C), and temperature responses declined as stream size increased.",,,,,,"Warren, Dana/0000-0001-5282-7972",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1127,1872-7042,,,,OCT 15,2020,474,,,,,,,,118354,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118354,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118354,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000578989200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the few mammalian species that manages to inhabit this challenging habitat is the reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus). The aim of our study was to determine whether this small primate uses continuous hibernation as an energy saving strategy, and if so, to characterize its physiological properties. We measured skin temperature of 16 free-ranging individuals continuously over 3 months during the cool dry season using collar temperature data loggers. Prolonged hibernation was found in three mouse lemurs and was not sex dependent (one male, two females). Skin temperature of hibernating individuals tracked ambient temperature passively with a minimum skin temperature of 6.5A degrees C and fluctuated strongly each day (up to 20A degrees C), depending on the insulation capacity of the hibernacula. Individuals remained in continuous hibernation even at an ambient temperature of 37A degrees C. The animals hibernated continuously during the dry season, and hibernation bouts were only interrupted by short spontaneous arousals. The study emphasizes that hibernation is an important measure to counter environmental challenge for more tropical species than previously thought, including primates.

However, cross-study comparisons are impeded by the paucity of detailed analyses of how passive warming and other manipulations affect microclimate. Here we document the independent and combined effects of a common passive warming manipulation, open-top chambers (OTCs), and a simulated widespread land use, clipping, on microclimate on the Tibetan Plateau. OTCs consistently elevated growing season averaged mean daily air temperature by 1.0-2.0 degrees C, maximum daily air temperature by 2.1-7.3 degrees C and the diurnal air temperature range by 1.9-6.5 degrees C, with mixed effects on minimum daily air temperature, and mean daily soil temperature and moisture. These OTC effects on microclimate differ from reported effects of a common active warming method, infrared heating, which has more consistent effects on soil than on air temperature. There were significant interannual and intragrowing season differences in OTC effects on microclimate. For example, while OTCs had mixed effects on growing season averaged soil temperatures, OTCs consistently elevated soil temperature by approximately 1.0 degrees C early in the growing season. Nonadditive interactions between OTCs and clipping were also present: OTCs in clipped plots generally elevated air and soil temperatures more than OTCs in nonclipped plots. Moreover, site factors dynamically interacted with microclimate and with the efficacy of the OTC manipulations. These findings highlight the need to understand differential microclimate effects between warming methods, within warming method across ecosystem sites, within warming method crossed with other treatments, and within sites over various timescales.

The capability of ANN models to simulate the variation of temperature in soils was investigated by considering readily available meteorologic parameters. The ANN model was constructed by using five years of meteorologic data, measured at a weather station at the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The model inputs consisted of daily rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and the day of the year. The model outputs were daily soil temperatures at the depths of 100, 500 and 1500 mm. The estimated Values were found to be close to the measured values, as shown by a root-mean-square error ranging from 0.59 to 1.82 degrees C, a standard deviation of errors from 0.61 to 1.81 degrees C, and a coefficient of determination from 0.937 to 0.987. Therefore, it is concluded that ANN models can be used to estimate soil temperature by considering routinely measured meteorologic parameters.

Rates of gastric evacuation were faster than have previously been measured for sharks. The time for 80% of the meal weight (dry) to be evacuated ranged from 5.4 to 22.1 h. Daily ration was estimated using two different methods based on gastric evacuation rates and stomach content data. Estimates ranged from 2.12% to 3.54% of the body weight, which is relatively high compared to other elasmobranchs, but lower than estimates of maintenance ration for juvenile scalloped hammerheads.

Many arid-adapted endotherms already experience conditions at their physiological limits, so it is conceivable that they could be similarly affected by warming temperatures. We explored how climatic variables might influence the apparent survival of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis), a rodent endemic to the Chihuahuan Desert of North America and renowned for its behavioral and physiological adaptations to arid environments. Relative variable weight, strength of variable relationships, and other criteria indicated that summer, diurnal land surface temperature (SD_LST) was the primary environmental driver of apparent survival in these arid-adapted rodents. Higher temperatures had a negative effect on apparent survival, which ranged from 0.15 (SE = 0.04) for subadults to 0.50 (SE = 0.07) for adults. Elevated SD_LST may negatively influence survival through multiple pathways, including increased water loss and energy expenditure that could lead to chronic stress and/or hyperthermia that could cause direct mortality. Land surface temperatures are predicted to increase by as much 6.5A degrees C by 2099, reducing apparent survival of adults to similar to 0.15 in some regions of the species' range, possibly causing a shift in their distribution. The relationship between SD_LST and survival suggests a mechanism whereby physiological tolerances are exceeded resulting in a reduction to individual fitness that may ultimately cause a shift in the species' range over time.",,,,,"Frey, Jennifer K./F-8945-2011","Frey, Jennifer K./0000-0002-0122-2567",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,JAN,2012,168,1,,,,,257,268,,10.1007/s00442-011-2073-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-2073-2,,,,,,,,21833644,,,,,WOS:000299058100024,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature reductions were imposed only while the plants were under black cloth using a combination of air-conditioning and under-cloth ventilation. The two heat-sensitive cultivars tested were 'Yellow Mandalay' and 'Coral Charm' and the two heat-tolerant cultivars were 'Iridon' and 'Dark Bronze Charm'. Differences in time-to-flower (TTF) between heat tolerance classifications were less than anticipated. TTF was affected the most in 'Iridon', a heat-tolerant cultivar, decreasing by an average of 4.2 days/degrees C as mean diurnal temperatures (MT) decreased from about 26 degrees C to about 23 degrees C. TTF was affected the least in 'Coral Charm', a heat-sensitive cultivar, decreasing by an average of 2.8 days/degrees C over the same range. Inflorescence diameter, on the other hand, increased by as much as 9% in the two heat-sensitive cultivars but by only about 4% in the heat-tolerant cultivars.

We determined the temperature tolerance range of the crab to be between 10.5 and 26 degrees C based on behavioral assays, along with mapping the likely effect of climate change on its biogeographic range using this temperature tolerance and the history of collections to inform a MaxEnt model. We found that N. macropa is not likely to change its geographic range in the next 70 years. It has a relatively wide temperature tolerance range (15.5 degrees C) for a tropical animal, probably due to the wide daily temperature swing present on the Bogota Plain.

Hatchlings from an XX male-XX female cross were reared at 23 +/- 0.5 degrees C until Day 12 (days after fertilization), and divided into experimental groups reared at 15, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28 or 30 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The proportions of females were 94.6% at 15 degrees C, 100% at 17 degrees C, 94.6% at 20 degrees C 90.5% at 23 degrees C 46.6% at 25 degrees C, 15.4% at 28 degrees C, and 7.7% at 30 0.5 degrees C. This result confirms that genotypic females can be changed to phenotypic males by high temperature treatment. To determine the temperature sensitive period (TSP) of sex differentiation, the sex ratio was measured in groups of larvae shifted reciprocally between 23 and 30 degrees C as development progressed. The percentage of females increased in test groups shifted from 23 to 30 degrees C at Days 17, 22 and 27 and decreased in groups shifted from 30 to 23 degrees C at Day 17 and 22. The end point of the TSP occurs on Day 17 at 30 degrees C and on Day 22 at 23 degrees C, implying that the TSP is shortened at higher temperatures. To investigate the effect of fluctuating temperatures on sex differentiation, several one-day temperature pulses from 23 to 30 degrees C or 30 to 23 degrees C were applied, during the TSP. The pulse to 23 degrees C, from the basal temperature of 30 degrees C, resulted in a decreased percentage of males, however, the pulse to 30 degrees C, from the basal temperature of 23 degrees C, had no effect on the sex ratio. Theses results show that high temperature must be maintained during the TSP in order to produce a high proportion of masculinized genetic female goldfish. In conclusion, water temperature can play an important role in the process of sex differentiation in goldfish, as has been seen in other teleosts and reptiles, and be applied to aquaculture as a tool for control of sex.

A nested-scale experimental watershed study design was used to test T-w model predictions in a representative mixed-use urbanizing watershed of the central USA. The linear regression T-w model used in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a non-linear regression T-w model, and a process-based T-w model that accounts for watershed hydrology were evaluated. The non-linear regression T-w model tested at a daily time step performed significantly (P<0.01) better than the linear T-w model currently used in SWAT. Both regression T-w models overestimated T-w in lower temperature ranges (T-w<10.0 degrees C) with percent bias (PBIAS) values ranging from -28.2% (non-linear T-w model) to -66.1% (linear regression T-w model) and underestimated T-w in the higher temperature range (T-w>25.0 degrees C) by 3.2%, and 7.2%, respectively. Conversely, the process-based T-w model closely estimated T-w in lower temperature ranges (PBIAS=4.5%) and only slightly underestimated T-w in the higher temperature range (PBIAS=1.7%). Findings illustrate the benefit of integrating process-based T-w models with hydrologic models to improve model transferability and T-w predictive confidence in urban mixed-land use watersheds. The findings in this work are distinct geographically and in terms of mixed-land use complexity and are therefore of immediate value to land-use managers in similarly urbanizing watersheds globally.

Using a new statistical approach, we quantified the consistency in nocturnal metabolic rate across a temperature range in zebra finches (N=3213 measurements on 407 individuals) living permanently in eight outdoor aviaries. Foraging conditions were either benign or harsh, and body mass and mass-adjusted BMR (BMRm) and SMR (SMRm) were lower in individuals living in a harsh foraging environment. The correlation between SMRm at different T-a was high (r=0.91), independent of foraging environment, showing that individuals are consistently ranked according to their SMRm. However, the correlations between BMRm and SMRm were always lower (average: r=0.29; range: 0<r<0.50), in particular in the benign foraging environment. Variation in metabolic response to lower T-a at least in part reflected differential body temperature (T-b) regulation: early morning T-b was lower at low T-a, and more so in individuals with a weaker metabolic response to lower T-a. Our findings have implications for the use of BMR in the estimation of time-energy budgets and comparative analyses: we suggest that the use of metabolic rates at ecologically relevant T-a, such as the easily tractable SMR, will be more informative than the use of BMR as a proxy for energy turnover.",,,,,"Verhulst, Simon/B-1613-2009; Verhulst, Simon/S-3404-2019","Verhulst, Simon/0000-0002-1143-6868; Verhulst, Simon/0000-0002-1143-6868; Briga, Michael/0000-0003-3160-0407",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,SEP 15,2017,220,18,,,,,3280,3289,,10.1242/jeb.160069,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.160069,,,,,,,,28684463,,,,,WOS:000411199600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

We then conduct experiments to test the sensitivity of the glacier flow to basal lubrication and tidal forcing at the calving front. Reduction of the basal drag by 10-40% produces speed-ups that agree approximately with the observed range of speed-ups that result from warm weather and precipitation events. In agreement with the observations, tidal forcing and surface speed near the calving front are found to be in anti-phase (high tide corresponds to low speed, and vice versa).

Shallow groundwater temperatures, along with bed temperature profiles at depths of 1 to 30cm, were recorded at 10-min intervals in two hydrologically distinct reaches beginning in 2003 or 2004, depending on the site. The lower reach had smaller discharge contributions via lateral inflow from the hillslopes and fewer areas with upwelling (UW) and/or neutral flow across the stream bed compared to the middle reach. Bed temperatures were greater than those of shallow groundwater during summer, with higher temperatures in areas of downwelling (DW) flow compared to areas of neutral and UW flow. A paired-catchment analysis revealed that partial-retention forest harvesting in autumn 2004 resulted in higher daily maximum stream and bed temperatures but smaller changes in daily minima. Changes in daily maximum stream temperature, averaged over July and August of the post-harvest year, ranged from 1.6 to 3 degrees C at different locations within the cut block. Post-harvest changes in bed temperature in the lower reach were smaller than the changes in stream temperature, greater at sites with DW flow, and decreased with depth at both UW and DW sites, dropping to about 1 degrees C at a depth of 30cm. In the middle reach, changes in daily maximum bed temperature, averaged over July and August, were generally about 1 degrees C and did not vary significantly with depth. The pre-harvest regression models for shallow groundwater were not suitable for applying the paired-catchment analysis to estimate the effects of harvesting.

In this paper, we demonstrate how the model can be fitted to vital rates (i.e., rates associated with development, survival, hatching, and oviposition) of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae (Koch)) exposed to different constant temperatures ranging from 15 degrees C to 37.5 degrees C. SANDY was incorporated into an age-, stage- and sex-structured dynamic model, which was fitted to cohort life-tables of T. urticae conducted at five constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C). Age-and temperature-dependent vital rates for the three main stages (eggs, immatures, and adults) constituting the life-cycle of mites were adequately described by the SANDY model. The modeling approach allows for simulating the growth of a population in a variable environment. We compared the predicted net reproductive rate (R0) and intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) at fluctuating temperatures with empirical values obtained from life-table experiments conducted at temperatures that changed with a daily amplitude (+/- 0, +/- 3, +/- 6, +/- 9, and +/- 12 degrees C) around an average of 22 degrees C. Results show that R-0 decreases with increasing amplitude, while r(m) is more robust to variable temperatures. An advantage of SANDY is that the same simple mathematical expression can be applied to describe all the vital rates. Besides, the approach is not confined to modeling the influence of a single factor on population growth but allows for incorporating the combined effect of several limiting factors, provided that the combined effect of the factors is multiplicative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,JUN,2015,44,3,,,,,821,834,,10.1093/ee/nvv056,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvv056,,,,,,,,26313989,,,,,WOS:000356183700041,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, we performed a three-year field warming experiment with free air temperature increase (FATI) facility to investigate the actual response of midseason rice growth in East China. There were four treatments (AW: all-day warming; DW: daytime warming; NW: nighttime warming; CK: ambient control) with three replicates. This FATI facility presented a good simulation of the local air temperature pattern with an increase in the daily mean temperature of about 1.1-2.0 degrees C during rice whole growth duration compared to the ambient control. Warming shortened the pre-heading phase respectively by 3.3 d, 1.7 d and 2.0 d in the AW. DW and NW plots, while the post-heading phase stayed almost unchanged. During the three years, warming slightly decreased the aboveground biomass by an average of 9.1%, 10.3% and 3.3%, and the grain yield by an average of 0.9%, 6.4% and 6.1% in the AW, DW and NW plots, respectively. Warming tended to decrease rice photosynthesis rate and stimulate the nighttime respiration rate. It also enlarged the flag leaf area and increased its chlorophyll content. No significant difference and interaction in the actual response of rice growth were found between the warming regimes. The above evidences suggest that the expected warming less than 2.0 degrees C may not cause significant decrease in rice productivity in East China. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The photosynthetic temperature optimum of recently expanded leaves in the sun canopy was linearly related to the average temperature of the preceding week during the 9-month measurement period. The optimum temperature for net photosynthesis of E. globulus increased from 17 to 23 degrees C as the mean daily temperature increased from 7 to 16 degrees C. Similarly, the optimum temperature for net photosynthesis off. nitens increased from 14 to 20 degrees C as the mean daily temperature increased from 7 to 19 degrees C. The temperature for maximum photosynthetic response of E. globulus and E. nitens was similar at each measurement time, but the photosynthetic performance of E. nitens was less sensitive to temperatures above and below this optimum than that of E. globulus. In December, the apical shoots of branches of E. globulus had a net photosynthetic temperature optimum of between 10 and 15 degrees C. The corresponding values for expanding leaves, fully expanded leaves from the current year's growth, and fully expanded leaves from the previous year's growth were 15, 20 and 20-25 degrees C, respectively. In a second experiment, E. globulus clones taken from four mother plants originating from climatically dissimilar locations within Tasmania were acclimated at day/night temperatures of 10/15, 18/23 and 25/30 degrees C in temperature-controlled greenhouses. Another set of clones was acclimated in a shade-house where temperatures ranged between 10 and 25 degrees C and with a mean daily temperature of approximately 15 degrees C. Plants grown at 25/30 degrees C had significantly lower net photosynthetic rates when measured at 10 and 20 ''C than plants grown at lower temperatures. Plants grown at 10/15 ''C had significantly lower net photosynthetic rates when measured at 30 OC than plants grown at higher temperatures. Plants grown at the ambient conditions prevailing in midautumn in Hobart had significafitly higher net photosynthetic rates at 20 OC than plants raised in the greenhouses and were equal best performers at 10 and 30 degrees C. A comparison of the light response curves of the plants showed that the maximum rate of net photosynthesis was affected by the growth temperature, whereas the apparent quantum efficiency remained unchanged. There were no significant differences in the photosynthetic temperature responses of the four genotypes derived from climatically dissimilar locations within Tasmania. A comparison of temperature response models for E. globulus indicated that incomplete acclimation (defined by a slope value of less than 1 for the linear relationship between the temperature optimum for photosynthesis and the growth temperature) generally resulted in a greater daily carbon uptake than complete acclimation (slope value of 1).",,,,,"beadle, chris l/C-9390-2011; Battaglia, MIchael/A-5545-2011","Battaglia, MIchael/0000-0003-0144-5442",,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,JAN-FEB,1996,16,1-2,,,,,81,89,,,,,,,,,,,14871750,,,,,WOS:A1996TT02400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

We aimed to characterise the coincidence of yield variations with weather variable for potato in northern China using long-term datasets. Daily climate variables obtained from 607 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2014, detailed field experimental data for the period of 1982 to 2012 in northern China, and multivariate linear statistical model were used in this study. In particular, the first difference method was used to disentangle the contributions-of climate change to-potato yield. We concluded that during the potato growing, the average daily, maximum and minimum temperatures significantly increased by 0.23 degrees C per decade, 0.20 degrees C per decade and 0.36 degrees C per decade from 1961 to 2014 in northern China, respectively. However, average total radiation, total annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from April to September all exhibited downward trends, but the variation of evapotranspiration (-9.99 mm per decade) was greater than that of precipitation (-2.65 mm per decade). The key climatic factors limiting potato yields in northern China over the past 30 years at a regional scale were diurnal temperature range, precipitation, radiation and ET0. The potato yield in northern China was the most sensitive to variation of the diurnal temperature range followed by radiation, precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0). Specifically, when the diurnal temperature range decreased 1 degrees C, the potato yield increased 543.9 kg.ha(-1). When the total radiation decreased 1 MJ.m(2), the potato yield increased 63.8 kg.ha(-1). When the ET0 decreased 1 mm, the potato yield increased 62.7 kg.ha(-1).

However, the effect of warming on the rhizosphere bacterial community of crops is not well understood. Therefore, we carried out pot experiments with three rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties in black soil across three climatic regions of northeast China to simulate temperature change, and analyzed the response of the rhizosphere bacterial community to different temperatures. Results showed that climate had stronger effects on rhizosphere bacterial communities than rice variety. The rhizosphere bacterial diversity differed significantly among the three climatic regions and positively correlated with the mean daily average temperature (MAveT), mean daily maximum temperature (MMaxT), and mean daily minimum temperature (MMinT), and negatively correlated with the daily temperature range (DTR). Principal co-ordinate analysis revealed that bulk soil bacterial communities maintained a high similarity across the three climatic regions, while rhizosphere bacterial communities notably varied. This change was significantly correlated with MAveT, MMaxT, MMinT, and DTR. Compared with bulk soil, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were enriched in the rhizosphere, while Actinobacteria was depleted. Moreover, these changes were strengthened by increasing the temperature and decreasing DTR. Additionally, correlation analysis revealed that changes in rhizosphere bacterial communities were closely related to the formation of rice yields.

The only input variable, necessary to run the model, is a time series of daily mean air temperature. The simulator employs 9 empirical parameters, which were estimated by inverse modeling. The model, which primarily addresses forested sites, incorporates the effect of snow cover and soil freezing on soil temperature. The model was applied to several temperate forest sites, managing the split between Central Europe (Austria) and the United States (Harvard Forest, Massachusetts; Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire), aiming to cover a broad range of site characteristics. Investigated stands differ fundamentally in stand composition, elevation, exposition, annual mean temperature, precipitation regime, as well as in the duration of winter snow cover. At last, to explore the limits of the formulation, the simulator was applied to non-forest sites (Illinois), where soil temperature was recorded under short cut grass. The model was parameterized, specifically to site and measurement depth. After calibration of the model, an evaluation was performed, using similar to 50 % of the available data. In each case, the simulator was capable to deliver a feasible prediction of soil temperature in the validation time interval. To evaluate the practical suitability of the simulator, the minimum amount of soil temperature point measurements, necessary to yield expedient model performance was determined. In the investigated case 13-20 point observations, uniformly distributed within an 11-year timeframe, have been proven sufficient to yield sound model performance (root mean square error <0.9 degrees C, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency >0.97). This makes the model suitable for the application on sites, where the information on soil temperature is discontinuous or scarce.",,,,,"Berger, Torsten W./B-7456-2017","Berger, Torsten W./0000-0002-5614-5888",,,,,,,,,,,,,2363-6203,2363-6211,,,,DEC,2015,1,4,,,,,,,32,10.1007/s40808-015-0041-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40808-015-0041-2,,,,,,,,26870835,,,,,WOS:000443080200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Continuing adaptation to climatic conditions in temperate areas would probably result in a spread to more northern European countries, producing an increasing risk of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission over a much greater area. Based on previous studies showing that Ae. albopictus is able to overwinter in Germany, this study aims to determine more exactly its ecological limits of enduring low temperatures.MethodsNon-diapausing and experimentally induced diapausing eggs of three different Ae. albopictus strains (tropical, subtropical and temperate origins) were exposed to four different regimes with constant temperatures and three different regimes with fluctuating temperatures in a course of a day for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 30 days. The hatching rate of larvae after cold exposure of the eggs was taken as a measure of cold tolerance.ResultsThe experiments showed that the tropical Ae. albopictus strain had a lower cold tolerance than the subtropical and the temperate strains. The eggs of all used strains were able to survive constant temperatures as low as -5 degrees C for an exposure period of 30 days, while constant temperatures as low as -10 degrees C were endured for 2 days by the tropical strain and for 10 and 20 days by the subtropical and temperate strains, respectively. At fluctuating temperatures, both the subtropical and the temperate strains exhibited hatching under all temperature regimes, even with a minimum temperature of -10 degrees C, whereas the tropical strain ceased hatching after an exposure period of 30 days under the temperature regime with a minimum temperature of -10 degrees C. The analyses showed that the temperature played the major role in interpreting the hatching rates of the eggs. The condition, whether the eggs were diapausing or not, had no significant influence, although results indicated a slightly higher cold tolerance of diapausing eggs at -10 degrees C.ConclusionsIt must be expected that subtropical and temperate strains of Ae. albopictus are able to withstand common central European winters and are able to establish in considerable parts of the continent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1756-3305,,,,,NOV 23,2020,13,1,,,,,,,587,10.1186/s13071-020-04386-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04386-7,,,,,,,,33225979,,,,,WOS:000595842100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we examined life histories of fall armyworm (FAW), a globally important invasive species with a broad ecological niche, at five constant temperatures of 13, 19, 25, 31 and 37 degrees C, to study life-history responses to different temperatures. RESULTS In our experiment, FAW had lower lifetime fecundity at unfavorable temperatures, a finding that is consistent with the idea that FAW can shift resources from reproduction to other functions under stressful conditions-such as heat or cold tolerance. Given the adverse effects of stressful temperatures, life-history strategies arise from individuals having limited remaining resources to allocate towards vital functions like survival or reproduction. Here we show plasticity in life-history strategies adopted at different temperatures. Rather than simply varying along a fast-slow continuum, FAW at unfavorably high temperatures exhibited lower daily fecundity and longer reproductive lifespans, and at unfavorably low temperatures showed a shorter peak in reproduction later in life, compared with FAW at 25 degrees C. Such patterns, if adaptive, could suggest a strategy mitigating reproductive and mortality risk in unfavorable environments, however, this remains to be tested. CONCLUSION Our analysis suggests that the high invasion success of FAW may result from their ability to adjust life-history strategies, across a range of stressful temperatures, in a way that reduces not only mortality, but also fecundity loss. The adoption of such strategies may be instrumental for the global invasion success of FAW.",,,,,,"Head, Megan/0000-0002-8123-7661",,,,,,,,,,,,,1526-498X,1526-4998,,,,JUN,2022,78,6,,,,,2398,2404,,10.1002/ps.6867,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6867,,MAR 2022,,,,,,35277917,,,,,WOS:000772487200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used doubly labelled water to determine daily, daytime and night-time field metabolic and water-influx rates in breeding babblers in spring and nonbreeding babblers in winter and summer. Daily and daytime energy expenditure rates were higher during the breeding season than during either summer or winter, but there was no difference among seasons in night-time energy expenditure rates. Thus, our hypothesis was supported. The daytime field metabolic rates in summer and winter nonbreeding babblers were 3.92x and 4.32x the resting metabolic rate (RMR), respectively, and in breeding babblers was 5.04x RMR, whereas the nighttime field metabolic rates ranged between 1.26x RMR and 1.35x RMR in the three seasons.

We evaluated the hypothesis that juvenile thermal tolerance determines northern range in gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), a species commonly caught as juveniles along the US Atlantic coast well north of their adult distribution, using a combined laboratory, field and modeling approach. The cumulative degree days below 17 degrees C (CDD<17) survived by individuals maintained in the laboratory under ambient seasonal cooling conditions were used to quantify the chronic effects of prolonged but non-lethal low temperatures. Under ambient conditions, juveniles stopped feeding below 11.3 degrees C, and the mean temperature at death was 10.2 degrees C (+/-0.74 S.D.). The CDD<17 endured by individuals ranged from 61.9 to 138.8 (8354+/-22.44 S.D.), and was positively related to fish size. The relation between CDD<17 and fish size was extrapolated to the maximum juvenile size in fall to provide an upper limit for survival in the wild (CDD<17 = 210 days). Acute low temperature tolerance was evaluated in a second experiment that exposed juveniles to a constant rate of temperature decline (3 degrees C where feeding ceased at 10.3 degrees C and death occurred at 7.0 degrees C (+/-0.45 S.D.). These thermal thresholds were combined with winter estuarine temperature data at 12 sites to evaluate potential overwinter survival along the US Atlantic coast. Of a total of 134 site-year combinations categorized based on the acute and chronic thresholds, the CDD<17 threshold (>210 days) was more limiting than the acute threshold (minimum daily temperature<7.0 degrees C) to survival of juveniles for a given site-year. To evaluate the relationship between juvenile thermal tolerance criteria and adult distributions, we quantified adult distribution using field observations in the western Atlantic Ocean compiled from a database of recreational divers. There was a strong correspondence between observations of adult gray snapper from the database of recreational divers vs. latitude with that of the predicted survival of juveniles vs. latitude from our analysis. The agreement between the laboratory-derived thermal tolerance metrics, the spatial distribution of winter temperature, and the distribution of adult gray snapper support the hypothesis that the adult range of gray snapper is largely limited by the overwinter survival of juveniles. Understanding the interaction between physiology and range is important for forecasting the impacts of climate change on other species of fish where juvenile tolerances are critical in determining range, particularly in seasonal systems.

We studied in field and laboratory experiments several aspects of the thermal biology of adult lacertid lizards (Takydromus septentrionalis). 2. The selected body temperature and the critical thermal maximum averaged 30.0 and 42.3 degrees C, respectively; the critical thermal minimum of males and females averaged 3.9 and 5.9 degrees C, respectively. 3. The lizards in May exhibited lower and more variable active body temperatures than did the lizards in July, because of lower and more variable air and substrate temperatures in May. 4. The sprint speed generally increased with body temperature within the range of 17 to 32 degrees C and decreased at temperatures >32 degrees C. 5. Within the range of 26 to 36 degrees C, body temperature influenced food assimilation primarily by affecting the food passage time, whereas it only slightly affected the daily food consumption, the apparent digestive coefficient and the assimilation efficiency. The food passage time decreased with increasing body temperature.

In this paper, we present how we combine passive microwave and thermal infrared data to estimate LST during summer snow-free periods over northern high latitudes. The methodology is based on the SSM/I-SSMIS 37 GHz measurements at both vertical and horizontal polarizations on a 25 km x 25 km grid size. LST is retrieved from brightness temperatures introducing an empirical linear relationship between emissivities at both polarizations as described in Royer and Poirier (2010). This relationship is calibrated at pixel scale, using cloud-free independent LST data from MODIS instruments. The SSM/I-SSMIS and MODIS data are synchronized by fitting a diurnal cycle model built on skin temperature reanalysis provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The resulting temperature dataset is provided at 25 km scale and at an hourly time step during the ten-year analysis period (2000-2011). This new product was locally evaluated at five experimental sites of the EU-PAGE21 project against air temperature measurements and meteorological model reanalysis, and compared to the MODIS LST product at both local and circumpolar scale. The results giving a mean RMSE of the order of 2.2 K demonstrate the usefulness of the microwave product, which is unaffected by clouds as opposed to thermal infrared products and offers a better resolution compared to model reanalysis.

The scallops were sampled in spring from three localities in Iceland, Breidafjordur (west), Hunafloi (north), and Hvalfjordur (southwest) and again in August from Breidafjordur and Hvalfjordur. Daily observations of mortality and behaviour were made over a 21-day period at sea temperatures ranging from 7 to 16degreesC in spring (April-May) and 11 to 14degreesC in August. During the spring experiment the tolerance of scallops, as expressed by mortality and behaviour, was distinctly reduced at sea temperatures above 12degreesC among scallops from Breidafjordur and Hunafloi and above 13degreesC among scallops from Hvalfjordur. During the second set of experiments, conducted in August, scallops were transported into the laboratory from a higher sea temperature than in the spring. As a result, mortality rates were much lower demonstrated by the fact that only scallops reared at sea temperature of 14degreesC died. This indicates that C. islandica may tolerate somewhat higher temperatures than have been observed in Icelandic waters in recent years.

To explore such effects, a controlled experiment was conducted, where three temperature levels (i.e., 15, 20, and 25 degrees C) and five salinity levels (i.e., 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mmol/L) were crossed, resulting in 15 treatments (i.e., 3 temperature levels x 5 salinity levels). Three typical grass species (Festuca arundinacea, Bromus inermis, and Elymus breviaristatus) were used, and 25 seeds of each species were sown in petri dishes under these treatments. Germination percentages and germination rates were calculated on the basis of the daily recorded germinated seed numbers of each species. Results showed that temperature and salinity significantly affected seed germination percentage and germination rate, which differed among species. Specifically, F. arundinacea had the highest germination percentage, followed by E. breviaristatus and B. inermis, with a similar pattern also found regarding the accumulated germination rate and daily germination rate. Generally, F. arundinacea was not sensitive to temperature within the range of 15-25 degrees C, while the intermediate temperature level improved the germination percentage of B. inermis, and the highest temperature level benefited the germination percentage of E. breviaristatus. Moreover, F. arundinacea was also not sensitive to salinity within the range of 0-200 mmol/L, whereas high salinity levels significantly decreased the germination percentage of B. inermis and E. breviaristatus. Thus, temperature and salinity can jointly affect seed germination, but these differ among plant species.

High elevation tropical environments are characterized by extreme daily thermal fluctuation including high daily maxima and nightly freezing. Our study investigated the contrasting operative temperatures of the anurans Telmatobius marmoratus and Pleurodema marmoratum in different environmental contexts at the same elevation and biome above 5,200 m. Telmatobius marmoratus avoids extremes of daily temperature fluctuation by utilizing thermally buffered aquatic habitat at all life stages, with minimal operative temperature variation (range: 4.6-8.0 degrees C). Pleurodema marmoratum, in contrast, experienced operative temperatures from -3.5 to 44 degrees C and has one of the widest thermal breadths reported for any tropical frog, from >32 degrees C (critical thermal maximum) to surviving freezing periods of 1 and 6 hr down to -3.0 degrees C. Our findings expand experimental evidence of frost tolerance in amphibians to the widespread Neotropical family Leptodactylidae, the first such evidence of frost tolerance in a tropical amphibian. Our study identifies three strategies (wide thermal tolerance breadth, use of buffered microhabitats, and behavioral thermoregulation), which allow these tropical frogs to withstand the current wide daily thermal fluctuation above 5,000 m.a.s.l. and which may help them adapt to future climatic changes. in Spanish is available with online material",,,,,,"Reider, Kelsey/0000-0002-0093-0529",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3606,1744-7429,,,,JAN,2021,53,1,,,,,296,306,,10.1111/btp.12875,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.12875,,OCT 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000583259600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The measurement of VOCs was conducted using a proton transfer reaction-quadrupole mass spectrometer (PTR-QMS). The study represents daily variability of ambient VOCs and their various associated emission sources. Diurnal profiles have differed from one VOC to another as the result of their different origins and the influence of different meteorological parameters (i.e. solar radiation, temperature) and planetary boundary layer height (PBL-H). The hourly mixing ratios of Oxygenated-VOCs (OVOCs) and aromatics were in the ranges of 0.6-29 ppbv and 0.13-14 ppbv, respectively with OVOCs accounted for up to 75% of total measured VOCs. The role of long-range transport from the clear Thar Desert and polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) was observed during the episodes of 1-15 and 17-31 December 2015, respectively. VOCs showed the strong diurnal variations with peaks during morning and evening hours and lowest in the afternoon. In the evening period, high levels of aromatics coincided with the lowest OVOCs suggests the role of fresh vehicular emissions. Emission ratios of various VOCs as a function of temperature showed the role of different sources including the biogenic and photochemical production as well as the anthropogenic sources, respectively. The higher emission ratio of Delta methanol/Delta acetonitrile at the study site suggests the long range transport of biomass burning plumes from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) during the 17-31, Dec. 2015. In addition to the pattern of emission, the diurnal and day-to-day variations of VOCs were influenced by the local meteorological conditions and depth of planetary boundary layer (PBL-H).

Thermal interval for leaf tip appearance (phyllochron) is critical for predicting duration of vegetative development. Phyllochron in maize is shorter in temperate than in tropical and subtropical environments. As existing data has been evaluated in a narrow range of environments, underlying mechanisms that affect phyllochron have not been adequately examined. The objectives of this study were to quantify the response of phyllochron to environmental variables and determine its stability across maize cultivars, to aid modelers in developing tools which accurately predict phenology. Maize was grown in field experiments at Wageningen, The Netherlands, Temple, Texas, USA, and three sites in Mexico, and in controlled environments at Wageningen. The experiment at Temple included grain sorghum and shading treatments to alter irradiance of the crop. Detailed data on leaf production and environmental conditions were collected. These data were combined with published data from held studies. Maize phyllochron acclimated to temperature and increased as mean daily temperature before tassel initiation increased from 12.5 to 25.5 degrees C, and increased in maize and sorghum in response to low irradiance. Temperature was the dominant influence, with phyllochron increasing by 1.7 degrees Cd per degrees C increase in daily mean temperature, as daily mean temperature before tassel initiation increased from 12.5 to 25.5 degrees C, and declined or remained constant when mean daily temperature before tassel initiation exceeded 25.5 degrees C. Only small differences in phyllochron occurred among cultivars.

Thus, experiments manipulating multiple environmental factors concurrently provide valuable insight into the role of the environment in shaping not only important traits (e.g. dispersal capacity or reproduction), but also trait-trait interactions (e.g. trade-offs between traits). We used a multi-factorial design to manipulate variation in temperature (constant 28 degrees C vs. 28 +/- 5 degrees C daily cycle) and food availability (unlimited vs. intermittent access) throughout development in the sand field cricket (Gryllus firmus). Using a univariate approach, we found that temperature variability and unlimited food availability promoted survival, development, growth, body size and/or reproductive investment. Using principal components as indices of resource allocation strategy, we found that temperature variability and unlimited food reduced investment into flight capacity in females. Thus, we detected a sex-specific trade-off between flight and other life-history traits that was developmentally plastic in response to variation in temperature and food availability. We develop an experimental and statistical framework to reveal shifts in correlative patterns of investment into different life-history traits.

Moreover, vaginal temperature increased 0.10 and 0.22 degrees C per unit of THI (R-2 = 0.15 in experiment 1; R-2 = 0.40 in experiment 2). Afternoon vaginal temperature strongly correlated with RT (r = 0.69, n = 131 in experiment 1; r = 0.63, n = 37 in experiment 2) and explained 57 (experiment 1) arid 68% (experiment 2) of variation in RT. Surface temperature showed moderate to strong correlations with RT (r = 0.57, n = 84) and vaginal temperature (r = 0.74, n = 37) in experiment 2. In conclusion, THI showed a weak to moderate relationship with core body temperatures and explained the increase in rectal and vaginal temperatures experienced by HS cows. Compared with rectal temperature, vaginal temperature showed stronger relationships with THI and can be used to determine thermal load. Udder surface temperature showed a moderate to strong relationship with core body temperature, and this relationship may support the use of surface temperature data to manage thermal load in HS cows.",,,,,"Ríus, Agustín/AAZ-3166-2020","Ríus, Agustín/0000-0001-5602-4990",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0302,1525-3198,,,,JUL,2018,101,7,,,,,6424,6429,,10.3168/jds.2017-13799,http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-13799,,,,,,,,29605321,,,,,WOS:000436481500067,View Full Record in Web of Science

This range limit may be determined by temperature during their planktonic larval phase. We examined the effect of temperature on survival and growth of larval ribbed mussels reared in the laboratory over 28 days at 15, 19, 23, and 28 degrees C. In daily samples, we enumerated live and dead larvae and measured shell length and width of live individuals. Larval survival was high and similar at temperatures >= 19 degrees C (e.g., proportion alive +/- SE; 0.88 +/- 0.02 after 3 wk), but was lower and more variable at 15 degrees C (e.g., 0.56 +/- 0.16 after 3 wk). Instantaneous mortality rates per d were > 2 times lower at >= 19 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. Larval growth rate increased with temperature, and Growing Degree Days (GDD) explained 85-95% of the variation in mean shell length. When larvae began settling, we measured the proportion of settlers in cohorts at 19, 23, and 28 degrees C; there was no settlement at 15 degrees C. Larval settlement occurred earlier at 28 degrees C (16 d) than 23 degrees C (18 d) and 19 degrees C (19 d). GDD significantly affected mean proportion of larvae settled, but only accounted for 29% of the variation. Our study demonstrates that GDD is a good predictor of larval growth for ribbed mussels and provides insights on larval developmental stages (e.g., potential timing of changes in resource allocation). Our study also provides support for the hypothesis that cold ocean temperatures ( <= 15 degrees C) may be a major limiting factor for successful development of larvae in the field and so for the dynamics of northern populations of ribbed mussels.",,,,,,"Metaxas, Anna/0000-0002-1935-6213; Virgin, Spencer/0000-0002-3066-0304; , Kevin/0000-0002-2231-3011",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,MAR,2019,512,,,,,,31,41,,10.1016/j.jembe.2018.11.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2018.11.006,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000457819300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Vertical transects of probes were deployed at Bridget Cove at +5.0 m (above the tidal range), +3.5, +2.5 m, +1.5 m and 0 m. Two additional probes were partially buried at +1.5 m; burial ameliorated freezing temperatures. Duration of emersion increased with intertidal height and was of longer duration at +3.5 m during Neap tides and at +1.5 and 0 m during Spring tides. Monthly measures of temperature were: average temperature, monthly maximum, average daily monthly maximum, average daily monthly minimum, and monthly minimum. Monthly maximum air temperature increased with tidal height. Winter average daily monthly minimum fell below 0 degrees C at the +3.5, +2.5, and +1.5 m tidal heights for the aerially exposed probes. The number of days when emersion temperature fell below 0 degrees C increased with intertidal height as did the number of hours per day.

In particular, little is known about the potential of tropical species to acclimate physiologically to future increases in temperature. Seedlings of 10 neo-tropical tree species from different functional groups were cultivated in controlled-environment chambers under four day/night temperature regimes between 30/22 C and 39/31 C. Under well-watered conditions, all species showed optimal growth at temperatures above those currently found in their native range. While non-pioneer species experienced catastrophic failure or a substantially reduced growth rate under the highest temperature regime employed (i.e. daily average of 35 C), growth in three lowland pioneers showed only a marginal reduction. In a subsequent experiment, three species (Ficus insipida, Ormosia macrocalyx, and Ochroma pyramidale) were cultivated at two temperatures determined as sub- and superoptimal for growth, but which resulted in similar biomass accumulation despite a 6C difference in growth temperature. Through reciprocal transfer and temperature adjustment, the role of thermal acclimation in photosynthesis and respiration was investigated. Acclimation potential varied among species, with two distinct patterns of respiration acclimation identified.

It is usually described, using Arrhenius kinetics, as increasing with the stability of the substrate in laboratory conditions, where substrate availability is non-limiting and where chemical recalcitrance, therefore, predominantly regulates stability. However, conditions of non-limiting subtrate availability are rare in the undisturbed soil, where physicochemical protection of substrates may control their stability. The aim of this study was to assess the temperature sensitivity of decomposition of SOM with contrasting stability in the field. Our conceptual approach was based on in situ measurements of soil CO2 efflux at a range of temperatures from root exclusion plots of increasing age (1 month and three decades) and, therefore, with SOM of increasing stability. From a set of short-term measurements in spring, using diurnal temperature variation, the relative temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition decreased significantly (p < 0.0001) with increasing SOM stability, and was weak (Q(10) < 1.3) in long-term root exclusion plots. This result was confirmed in a similar set of short-term measurements repeated later in the year, in summer, as well as from an analysis perfomed at the seasonal timscale. We provide direct field evidence that the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition decreases with increasing stability, in direct contrast with Arrhenius kinetics prediction, and therefore show that stability of SOM in the field cannot be the sole result of chemical recalcitrance. We conclude that the physicochemical protection of SOM, which controls SOM stability in the field, constrains the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition under field conditions.

Long-term manipulative field experiments are important tools to provide accurate information for revealing the impacts of climate change oil crop yields. Using the field records of a long-term fertilization experiment conducted in Northeast China, we analyzed the response of soybean yields to mean daily maximum temperature during seed filling over the period 1987-2007. The results showed that there was a clear positive response of soybean yields to increased mean daily maximum temperature during seed filling ranged from 20 to 24 degrees C. When compared with the average soybean yields over the last two decades, grain yields increased by 6-10% for each 1 degrees C increase in mean daily maximum temperature during seed filling and more than 22% of yield trends call be explained.

The first experiment stocked early stage nauplii into I L beakers and cultured them using standard procedures until five days after the first mature adults were observed; from this survival, sex ratio, time to maturation, and fecundity were measured. The second and third experiments evaluated the effects of temperature on nauplii production by stocking individual pairs and 25 pairs of adults, respectively; in both experiments nauplii production was determined daily for 10 days. The fourth experiment determined the effects of temperature on population growth and composition of the population produced by stocking 10 adult pairs and culturing them for 10 days at six temperatures. Results indicate survival from early nauplii to adult was significantly affected by temperature and those cultured from 24-30 degrees C had the highest mean survival. Time to first maturation and maturation of the entire population was significantly influenced by temperature and took from 6.8 to 12.8 days. Temperature significantly affected nauplii production in both individual and groups of paired adults. Temperature affected the mean daily nauplii production by decreasing the brood interval but did not affect the mean brood size. The number of nauplii produced by 25 adult pairs was significantly influenced by temperature; the optimal temperature was 27.5 degrees C at which 1861 nauplii were produced. The distribution of developmental stages in the population was also affected by temperature; at lower temperatures the population consisted of a greater proportion of nauplii while at 32 degrees C the population was comprised of more advanced staged individuals. When developing production objectives, aquaculturists must consider temperature because it has multiple effects on the culture of P. pelagicus. The optimal temperature range to achieve high survival and the greatest nauplii production is 26-30 degrees C. To maintain long-term stock cultures the best temperature may be 24 degrees C to slow maturation and growth while 28-32 degrees C may be used to maximize nauplii production by decreasing time to maturation and decreasing brood intervals.

Carbon-use efficiency of plants (CUEp) and ecosystems (CUEe) represents the capacity of plants to capture C and ecosystems to store C fixed from the atmosphere, respectively. Few studies have examined how grassland CUE responds to asymmetric warming. As part of a long-term (2006-2016) field experiment that simulated daytime and nighttime warming in a semi-arid temperate steppe on the Mongolian Plateau, this study was conducted to examine the effects of daytime and nighttime warming on CUEp and CUEe. Nighttime warming, unlike daytime warming, increased CUEe by 54.2%, whereas neither nighttime nor daytime warming affected CUEp. Ecosystem-level CUE linearly increased with soil moisture but declined with soil temperature variation (CVST). The suppressed ER, which might have been driven by the reduced CVST, primarily contributed to the higher CUEe under nighttime warming. These observations indicate that a reduced DTR, associated with a warmer night under asymmetric diurnal climate warming, could increase the capacity of the temperate steppe transferring C into ecosystems by elevating CUEe, resulting more C sequestration.

An extreme cold event occurring in early 2008 offered a unique opportunity to examine the effect of cold-water anomalies on Porites lutea corals and their physiological tolerance and acclimation in the subtropical northern South China Sea (NSCS). Besides in-situ observation, a subsequent aquarium-based experiment was designed for reproducing the chilling process and a 50-year-long Sr/Ca ratio profile from two P. lutea skeletal slabs was analyzed for reconstructed the historical annual minimum SSTs which ceased Porites calcification. The 2008 low-temperature anomaly caused the minimum daily mean SSTs dropped below 13A degrees C in the Daya Bay. The stress symptoms displayed by local P. lutea colonies included polyp retraction, reduced coloration and pale, but none showed tissue sloughing. The ability of P. lutea to survive implied its tolerance of extreme low temperatures. Here we suggest a model on the tolerance of high-latitude Porites under low-temperature stresses, which is when SSTs drop below 18A degrees C, Porites corals contract their tentacles (losing heterotrophic capability), then cease calcification (reducing energy consumption), and meanwhile maintain relatively high levels of zooxanthellae density (sustaining host's life via photosynthetic capacity of symbiotic zooxanthellae). This study revealed remarkable acclimatization of P. lutea corals to low temperature extremes. This acclimatization is beneficial for Porites corals in the NSCS to expand their living ranges towards the higher-latitude areas and have the potential to be the incipient reef former.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0253-505X,1869-1099,,,,DEC,2016,35,12,,,,,58,64,,10.1007/s13131-016-0940-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13131-016-0940-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391423600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a second experiment, temperature was constant, 15 degrees C. Finally, a third experiment was conducted at three constant temperatures, 12, 15 and 20 degrees C under excess of food to determine temperature effects on egg production for a more extended period of rime. As food, a monoculture of Isochrysis galbana Parke was used For the first experiment and phytoplankton collected from tile same Bay cultured in F2 medium was used for the second and third experiments. In the first experiment clutch size (CS), defined as the total number of eggs laid at once within a 2 h period, ranged between 5 and 84 eggs female(-1). In most cases all the eggs were able to hatch and those that did not hatch were assumed as nonviable. CS was positively correlated to temperature, but only 2 out of 12 females were able to lay eggs at the lowest temperature (9 degrees C), whereas at the highest temperature (20 degrees C) CS tended to decline. There was a lack of synchrony in egg laying and no temperature effect on the number of nonviable eggs was detected. However a significant positive correlation between CS and the number of nonviable eggs was found (F-1,F-25=4.67, P<0.05). In the second experiment CS was highly variable, 36+/-degrees 18.67 (mean degrees S.D.) and not associated with either female length (F-1,F-26=1.86, P>0.05), or with female dry weight (F-1,F-26=0.026, P>0.05). Finally from the third experiment, egg production on a daily basis, was drastically reduced at 20 degrees C, while differences between 12 degrees C and 15 degrees C were not detected. Our results agree with previous studies indicating that egg production correlates positively with temperature. However, there appears to be an ''optimal temperature range'', within which maximal clutch sizes and daily egg production rates are attained. This temperature range coincides with that observed at the upper 10 m layer in the study area. This suggests that maximal egg production rates of this species would only take place at the upper layer. On the other hand, sharp population declines, such as that observed during ''El Nino'' 1991-92, may have been caused by abrupt changes in water temperature giving rise to a poor recruitment, because of depleted egg production taking place at temperatures greater than 20 degrees C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0716-078X,,,,,SEP,1996,69,3,,,,,365,377,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VZ66200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Energy expenditure",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many large mammals show pronounced seasonal fluctuations of metabolic rate (MR). It has been argued, based on studies in ruminants, that this variation merely results from different levels of locomotor activity (LA), and heat increment of feeding (HI). However, a recent study in red deer (Cervus elaphus) identified a previously unknown mechanism in ungulates-nocturnal hypometabolism-that contributed significantly to reduced energy expenditure, mainly during late winter. The relative contribution of these different mechanisms to seasonal adjustments of MR is still unknown, however. Therefore, in the study presented here we quantified for the first time the independent contribution of thermoregulation, LA and HI to heart rate (f(H)) as a measure of MR in a free-roaming large ungulate, the Przewalski horse or Takhi (Equus ferus przewalskii Poljakow). fH varied periodically throughout the year with a twofold increase from a mean of 44 beats min(-1) during December and January to a spring peak of 89 beats min(-1) at the beginning of May. LA increased from 23% per day during December and January to a mean level of 53% per day during May, and declined again thereafter. Daily mean subcutaneous body temperature (T-s) declined continuously during winter and reached a nadir at the beginning of April (annual range was 5.8 degrees C), well after the annual low of air temperature and LA. Lower T-s during winter contributed considerably to the reduction in f(H). In addition to thermoregulation, f(H) was affected by reproduction, LA, HI and unexplained seasonal variation, presumably reflecting to some degree changes in organ mass. The observed phase relations of seasonal changes indicate that energy expenditure was not a consequence of energy uptake but is under endogenous control, preparing the organism well in advance of seasonal energetic demands.",,,,,"Arnold, Walter/C-3394-2013","Arnold, Walter/0000-0001-6785-5685; Ruf, Thomas/0000-0002-9235-7079",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,NOV 15,2006,209,22,,,,,4566,4573,,10.1242/jeb.02536,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.02536,,,,,,,,17079726,,,,,WOS:000242132800021,View Full Record in Web of Science

One mechanism to confer associational resistance is believed to be exposure to neighbour-emitted volatiles, the receivers of which range from intra-and interspecific neighbour plants to higher-trophic-level insects. In previous studies the passive adsorption of neighbouremitted semivolatiles has been reported, but little is known regarding the mechanisms and ecological consequences on the receiver plant and its associated biota. To utilize volatile-based associational resistance for agricultural applications, it is imperative to know its effectiveness under varying diurnal temperatures and whether herbivore natural enemies, providing biological control, are impacted. Mimicking varying diurnal temperatures in a laboratory set-up, we assessed how the tritrophic model system Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli)-Plutella xylostella (crucifer specialist herbivore)-Cotesia vestalis (endoparasitoid of P. xylostella) is influenced by exposure to the natural semivolatile emitter plant Rhododendron tomentosum Harmaja. Results: Rhododendron tomentosum-exposed B. oleracea was less susceptible to P. xylostella oviposition at both night-time (12 degrees C) and day-time (22 degrees C) temperatures and less favoured and damaged by P. xylostella larvae at 12 degrees C. Exposure did not interfere with indirect defence, i.e. attraction of the natural enemy C. vestalis on host-damaged, R. tomentosum-exposed B. oleracea under 22 degrees C, while there was a reduction in attraction (marginal preference towards host-damaged B. oleracea) under 12 degrees C. Conclusions: The ability of R. tomentosum exposure to render associational resistance against an agriculturally important Brassica herbivore P. xylostella without severely compromising the specialist parasitoid C. vestalis host location encourages further studies on the potential of using this naturally abundant plant for biocontrol. The generality of our finding on temperature as a potential regulating mechanism for the efficacy of semivolatile emitter-based associational resistance towards specialist pest larval damage should be further studied in natural and agricultural associations. Our study emphasizes the need to develop techniques to compare volatiles at the leaf versus air interface and associate their appearance and ecological role with times of activity and level of specialisation of herbivores and their natural enemies.",,,,,"Holopainen, Jarmo K./B-1656-2008","Holopainen, Jarmo K./0000-0001-5026-3245; , Mengistu/0000-0003-2612-9243; Himanen, Sari J/0000-0001-6831-7694",,,,,,,,,,,,,1472-6785,,,,,MAY 29,2015,15,,,,,,,,16,10.1186/s12898-015-0048-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12898-015-0048-6,,,,,,,,26022675,,,,,WOS:000355161800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thermal and hydrothermal time models propose that seed germination rates are proportional to the amount by which temperature and water potential exceed threshold values for these environmental factors. Hence, base temperature for seed germination is a fundamental biological parameter for the prediction of weed emergence. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to estimate base temperature in three weed species belonging to the Asteraceae family, predominant in conservation tillage fields in north-eastern Italy. The traditional method based on germination assays at constant temperatures was compared with a method based on assays at alternating temperatures. The latter might represent an alternative to the former for those species which do not germinate or only poorly under constant temperatures. Base temperature was estimated by regressing the reciprocal of the median germination time on temperature comparing two functions, a broken-stick and an exponential-type model. Both models showed good fit to all data in the whole temperature range and in almost all cases provided similar estimates of base temperature. The main result is that, for the weed species examined in this study, the use of alternating temperatures for base temperature estimation appears to be possible. However, further research is required to test if the use of germination assays performed at alternating temperatures can be a suitable method to estimate base temperature of species that have too low germination at constant temperatures.",,,,,,"MASIN, ROBERTA/0000-0003-0882-0532",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1737,1365-3180,,,,DEC,2017,57,6,,,,,390,398,,10.1111/wre.12270,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.12270,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000415696400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study quantifies temporal changes in soil respiration and their driving factors in grassland and arable soils located in Northern Germany. Field measurements at an arable site showed diurnal mean soil respiration rates between 67 and 99 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) with a hysteresis effect following changes in mean soil temperatures. Field soil respiration peaked in April at 5767 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1), while values below 300 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) were measured in wintertime. Laboratory incubations were carried out in dark open flow chambers at temperatures from 5 degrees C to 40 degrees C, with 5 degrees C intervals, and soil moisture was controlled at 30%, 50%, and 70% of full water holding capacity. Respiration rates were higher in grassland soils than in arable soils when the incubating temperature exceeded 15 degrees C. The respiration rate difference between them rose with increasing temperature. Monthly median values of incubated soil respiration rates ranged from 0 to 26.12 and 0 to 7.84 mu g CO2 g(-1) dry weight h(-1), respectively, in grassland and arable land. A shortage of available substrate leads to a temporal decline in soil respiration rates, as indicated by a decrease in dissolved organic carbon. Temporal Q(10) values decreased from about 4.0 to below 1.5 as temperatures increased in the field. Moreover, the results of our laboratory experiments confirmed that soil temperature is the main controlling factor for the Q(10) values. Within the temperature interval between 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C, Q(10) values were around 2 while the Q(10) values of arable soils were slightly lower compared to that of grassland soils. Thus, laboratory studies may underestimate temperature sensitivity of soil respiration, awareness for transforming laboratory data to field conditions must therefore be taken into account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-4710,1651-1913,,,,OCT 3,2015,65,7,,,,,589,604,,10.1080/09064710.2015.1036305,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710.2015.1036305,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000359340100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this model, the values of the developmental index (DVI) which is a continuous variable representing rice development stage are defined to be 0 at the emergence, 1.0 at P1 and 2.0 at the heading, respectively. Under this defining condition of DVI, we determined, for each developmental phase before and after P1, the values of parameters of the equation giving the developmental rate (DVR) as a function of daily mean temperature and photoperiod, by using the Simplex method and rice phenology data. Field experiments on three cultivars of Nipponbare, Koshihikari and IR36, in Kyoto over four years using a range of sowing dates in each year, provided data for the parameter estimation and model validation. The values of parameters thus obtained suggested that DVR responses to temperature and photoperiod are different between the vegetative and reproductive development phases. The model explained dates of PI and heading of the three cultivars more accurately than the previous model, in which DVR responses to the environment were assumed to be unchanged before and after the PI. A close correspondence was observed between the DVI values calculated by the model and the morphological development stage of rice panicle, irrespective of environmental conditions and cultivars, suggesting that the model is applicable for the prediction of the panicle development from environmental conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0011-1848,,,,,MAR,1995,64,1,,,,,33,42,,10.1626/jcs.64.33,http://dx.doi.org/10.1626/jcs.64.33,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QM26400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drought is projected to intensify throughout their range, potentially leading to increased fire severity as moisture is a key control on severity. We studied the effect of low fuel moisture content (FMC) on fire severity by using 2 x 2 mrain-out shelters prior to completing 19 experimental fires in two sites in Scotland (UK): a dry heath with thin organic soils and a raised bog with deep, saturated peat, both dominated by Calluna vulgaris. Reduced FMC of the moss and litter (M/L) layer at both sites, and the soil moisture of the dry heath, increased fire-induced consumption of the M/L layer and soil heating at both sites. Increase in fire severity was greater at the dry heath than at the raised bog, e.g. average maximum temperatures at the soil surface increased from 31 degrees C to 189 degrees C at the dry heath, but only from 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C at the raised bog. Substantial M/L layer consumption was observed when its FMC was below 150%. This led to larger seasonal and daily soil temperature fluctuation, particularly at the dry heath during warm months. The results suggest that low FMC following predicted changes in climate are likely to increase wildfire severity and that the impact on vegetation composition and carbon stores may be greater at heathlands than at peatlands. Managed burning aiming to minimise fire severity (e.g. ignition of the M/L layer and exposure to lethal temperatures of ericoid seeds) should be carried out when the FMC of the M/L layer is above 150% and the FMC of the soil is above 200-300%.

The dendrometers used in these experiments measured only the dimensional changes of the woody cylinder (sap- and heartwood). Wood diameter was measured close to the ground and just below the living crown. After correction for thermal expansion of dendrometers and wood, diurnal variation of wood diameter ranged between 50 and 180 mum. Psychrometric measurements showed that xylem water potential varied in parallel to wood diameter. Diameter changes were always more pronounced at the higher stem position and exhibited a clear diurnal pattern. During the day, wood diameter decreased with increasing vapor pressure deficit and transpiration rate and with decreasing twig water potential. At night, the wood re-expanded but did not always reach the dimension of the previous day. Pre-dawn wood diam eter decreased during periods of soil drought, a process which rapidly stopped and reversed after rain events. On several days, oscillation in wood diameter was observed during the mid-day hours. The oscillation had a period of approximately 50 min and showed a phase shift between different stem heights. All observed patterns of wood shrinkage and expansion were consistent with the hypothesis that xylem water tension leads to an elastic contraction of xylem conduits. The results demonstrate that xylem diameter is more suitable than whole-stem diameter for monitoring changes in xylem water potential.",,,,,,"Hietz, Peter/0000-0002-0458-6593",,,,,,,,,,,,,0931-1890,,,,,MAY,2001,15,4,,,,,215,221,,10.1007/s004680100090,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004680100090,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000169064300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Time of flowering is mainly influenced by genotype, temperature and photoperiod. Field experiments were carried out at Foggia (southern Italy) during successive growing seasons (from 8 to 16 growing cycles according to species) to study the relation among air temperature, photoperiod and duration of the morphological development of flowering in eight forage legume species: sulla (Hedysarum coronarium L.), sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.). pea (Pisum sativun L.), berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth). Time to reach 10% flowering (EF) and 100% flowering (FF) were recorded. Rate of progress to flowering, defined as the inverse of time from sowing to EF and FF, was related to mean daily temperature, or to both mean daily temperature and mean photoperiod. Using the linear equations, the thermal time requirements (T-t) and the base temperature (T-b) expressed as heat units were determined by the x-intercept method for both EF and FF stages. Evaluation of flowering time was also based on days after planting (DAP), day of year (DOY) and on a photothermal index (PTI). For all species, a significant negative correlation (P >= 0.01) was found between planting date (PD) and DAP whereas PTI showed a significant negative relationship (P >= 0.05) only for faba bean, pea, berseem clover and common vetch. In sainfoin, sulla and berseem clover, the rate of progress to flowering was affected significantly (P >= 0.05) by both mean temperature and photoperiod. The T-t requirements to reach the EF and the FF stage ranged from 871 to 1665 degrees C day and from 1043 to 1616 degrees C day, respectively, for the studied species. Both phenological stages considered depended upon accumulated thermal time above a species-specific base temperature. Furthermore, in all legumes the onset of flowering only occurred when dual thresholds of a minimum T-t and a minimum photoperiod were reached, which were specific to each species.

Methods: Eight Hanwoo heifers (20 to 32 month) were examined in a field trial, with a space allowance of 10 m(2) per head. The BST was measured using an infrared thermographic camera. The BST of five body regions (eyes, hindquarters, nose, part of horns, and ears), ambient temperature (AT), and relative humidity (RH) were measured 7 times daily (07, 09, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 h) during each season with three replicates.

This cycling may contain important information regarding the ecosystem's functioning and, if property interpreted, can represent a valuable predictive tool in ecosystems management. This paper describes a simple algorithm for extracting meaningful information from daily cycles using fuzzy pattern recognition techniques. The algorithm is organised in three parts: in the first, typical patterns are extracted front experimental data to form the knowledge-base upon which the algorithm operates. The second step is to condense the information contained in the knowledge-base into mathematical objects, referred to in the paper as fuzzy masks. The third step is the Set-Lip of an inferential set of fuzzy rules, using the fuzzy masks as antecedents. Depending on how the inference engine is structured, the algorithm Output can be viewed as an assessment of the current daily cycle with respect to a set of typical system behaviours and decisions can be made accordingly. Two applications are presented to demonstrate the algorithm. In the first a medium-scale wastewater treatment plant with minimum instrumentation is considered. Based on diurnal flow variations of the last 2 days. the algorithm determines the current treatment level in terms of sludge recycling. The other application is the prediction of the eutrophication level in a coastal lagoon. In this case, the algorithm considers the diurnal fluctuations of basic water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, pH and temperature to detect the possibility of a macroalgae bloom. In both cases. the algrithm provides information about the shift of the system from one trend to another on the basis of the analysis of diurnal cycles.

They provide global information over the range of local solar times, from the lower stratosphere into the lower thermosphere, from the beginning of 2002, by one instrument. On the basis of zonal means of these data, we present new results from 20 to 100 km in altitude and from 48 degrees S to 48 degrees N in latitude, of ozone diurnal variations over 24 h in local solar time and over an annual cycle. While some of the results are new for the stratosphere, such comprehensive results for the mesosphere and lower thermosphere have not been available before. The diurnal variations generally become increasingly significant from the upper stratosphere into the lower thermosphere and provide information on the photochemistry of ozone and effects of transport over a diurnal cycle. Over most altitudes in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), our estimates show the expected decrease in ozone after sunrise, with smaller variations during the day, and the increase near sunset. Outside of a small altitude near 80 km, the nighttime mixing ratios are generally larger than the daytime values. The diurnal variations themselves appear to exhibit variations over an annual cycle, including semiannual and annual variations.

Elephant shrews are an ancient mammal order within a superordinal African clade including hyraxes, elephants, dugongs and the aardvark. M. proboscideus only employed torpor when deprived of food; torpor did not occur under an ad libitum diet at ambient temperatures of 10, 15 and 25 degrees C. Torpor bout duration ranged from <1 h to ca. is h. The times of entry into torpor were restricted to the scotophase, despite normothermic body temperature patterns indicating a rest phase coincident with the photophase. Full arousal was always achieved within the first 3 h of the photophase. When food deprived, the onset of the rest phase, and hence torpor, advanced with respect to the experimental photoperiod. The lowest torpor body temperature measured was 9.41 degrees C. Daily torpor in M. proboscideus confirms a pleisiomorphic origin of daily heterothermy. Torpor facilitates risk-averse foraging behaviour in these small omnivores by overcoming long-term energy shortfalls generated by the inherent variability of food availability in their semiarid, El Nino-afflicted habitats.",,,,,"Lovegrove, Barry G/D-1320-2009; Lawes, Michael J/N-2132-2013","Lawes, Michael J/0000-0002-2381-6147",,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,,,,,OCT,1999,169,7,,,,,453,460,,10.1007/s003600050242,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003600050242,,,,,,,,10595314,,,,,WOS:000083622300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Land surfaces can present varying degrees of inertia to atmospheric forcing variability (e.g., precipitation). This study asks: are regions with the most variable environmental forcing necessarily the regions with the largest land surface variability? Specifically, it seeks to determine why land surfaces show varying responsiveness to environmental forcing. The degree to which and the mechanisms for how landscapes modulate the forcing are evaluated using a decade-long satellite observation record of Africa's diverse climates. Surface responsiveness is quantified using intra-seasonal energy flux variability, based on the observed diurnal temperature amplitude. We map the responsiveness and analyze the underlying mechanisms over intra-seasonal timescales (especially interstorms). We show that, at a location, land surface responsiveness is dependent on the soil moisture distribution and the nonlinear relationship between energy fluxes and soil moisture. Land surfaces with greater responsiveness to climate are those with soil moisture distributions that span the threshold between evaporation regimes and spend most of their time in the water-limited regime. Consequently, surface responsiveness mechanisms drive land surface variability beyond high climatic variability. Since we find these results to hold from intra-seasonal to interannual timescales, we expect that these responsive regions will be most vulnerable to long-term shifts in climate forcing. The quantification of these phenomena and determination of their geographic distributions based on observations can help assess land surface models used to evaluate hydrologic consequences of climate change.",,,,,"Trigo, Isabel/H-1630-2011; Gianotti, Daniel/K-5606-2013","Trigo, Isabel/0000-0001-8640-9170; Feldman, Andrew/0000-0003-1547-6995; Gianotti, Daniel/0000-0003-4891-2474; Entekhabi, Dara/0000-0002-8362-4761",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,JAN,2022,58,1,,,,,,,e2021WR030316,10.1029/2021WR030316,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR030316,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000751310200054,View Full Record in Web of Science

We explored the effects of daily mean temperatures in the 12-40 degreesC range during the embryo growth phase on embryo growth characteristics in cv. HA89 by growing plants in temperature-controlled glasshouse modules between the start of linear embryo growth and physiological maturity. Grain was harvested at regular intervals during the growth period and rates and durations of embryo growth derived from bi-phasic linear regression models fitted to the resulting embryo weight dynamics data. Embryo filling duration showed a curvilinear response to temperature with a minimum close to 34 degreesC. In contrast, the curvilinear response of rate of embryo filling peaked at 25 degreesC. The opposing effects of these two responses produced a continuously decreasing embryo size with temperature (P < 0.0001) (average decrease 1.2% per <degrees>C) over much of the temperature range explored. A plot of the inverse of embryo growth duration against temperature served to estimate base and optimum temperatures of -1 and 34 degreesC, respectively. The response functions and cardinal temperatures defined in this experiment are expected to improve the capacity of current crop simulation models to describe grain-filling in sunflower.

The 30-year simulations are compared with the available surface station data, focusing on near-surface air temperature and precipitation. The analysis has shown that the model overestimates the diurnal temperature variation during the cold period of the year (DJF) in the majority of the stations. During the warm period (JJA) the simulated daily temperature range is shifted towards warmer values, while during the transient periods of the year (MAM and SON) it is shifted towards cooler values. Both usual goodness of fit indices and tests and some more advanced methods for comparing statistical distributions were used. The latter indicate that both a scale and location adjustment needs to be applied on the model results distribution in order to sufficiently describe the observed temperature distribution. Regarding rainfall, it was found that the model underestimates the seasonal rainfall during DJF and SON, mainly over the stations of the Mediterranean coast that receive most of the yearly rainfall during autumn and, mainly, winter. An interesting feature is that, during JJA, the model was able to reproduce quite efficiently the seasonal rainfall in the central Balkans that receive as much rain during summer as during winter.

This paper presents a method for the short-term forecasting of ETc using a single-crop coefficient approach and public weather forecasts. Temperature forecasts with a 7-day lead time in 2013-2015 were retrieved and entered into a calibrated Hargreaves-Samani model to compute daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) forecasts, while crop coefficient (K-c) empirical values were estimated from both observed ETc value and calculated ET0 values using the Penman-Monteith equation for the period of 2010-2012. Daily ETc forecasts of irrigated double-cropping rice were determined for three growing seasons during the period of 2013-2015 and were compared with ETc values measured by the weighing lysimeters at the Jiangxi experimental irrigation station in southeastern China. During the early rice season, the average mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values of ETc forecasts ranged from 0.95 to 1.06 mm day(-1) and from 1.18 to 1.31 mm day(-1), respectively, and the average correlation coefficient (R) ranged from 0.39 to 0.54; for late rice, the average MAE and RMSE values ranged from 1.01 to 1.09 mm day(-1) and from 1.32 to 1.40 mm day(-1), respectively, and the average R value ranged from 0.54 to 0.58. There could be three factors responsible for errors in ETc forecasts, including temperature forecast errors, K-c value errors and neglected meteorological variables in the HS model, including wind speed and relative humidity. In addition, ETc was more sensitive to changes in temperature than K-c. The overall results indicated that it is appropriate to forecast ETc with the proposed model for real-time irrigation management and water resource allocation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1611-2490,1611-2504,,,,JUL,2018,16,3,,,,,397,410,,10.1007/s10333-018-0633-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-018-0633-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000440287800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is evident that the 2-m air temperature was significantly influenced by transpiration of plants around the large area.

However, few studies have investigated the effect of higher temperature on tropical crops. We therefore performed an experiment with a tropical crop of Habanero pepper (Capsicum Chinense Jacq.). Three growth chambers were used, each with 30 Habanero pepper plants. Chambers were maintained at a diurnal maximum air temperature (DMT) of 30 (chamber 1), 35 (chamber 2) and 40 degrees C (chamber 3). Each contained plants from seedling to fruiting stage. Physiological response to variation in DMT was evaluated for each stage over the course of five months. The results showed that both leaf area and dry mass of Habanero pepper plants did not exhibit significant differences in juvenile and flowering phenophases. However, in the fruiting stage, the leaf area and dry mass of plants grown at 40 degrees C DMT were 51 and 58% lower than plants at 30 degrees C DMT respectively. Meanwhile, an increase in diurnal air temperature raised both stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, causing an increase in temperature deficit (air temperature - leaf temperature). Thus, leaf temperature decreased by 5 degrees C, allowing a higher CO2 assimilation rate in plants at diurnal maximum air temperature (40 degrees C). However, in CO2 measurements when leaf temperature was set at 40 degrees C, physiological parameters decreased due to an increase in stomatal limitation. We conclude that the thermal optimum range in a tropical crop such as Habanero pepper is between 30 and 35 degrees C (leaf temperature, not air temperature). In this range, gas exchange through stomata is probably optimal. Also, the air temperature-leaf temperature relationship helps to explain how temperature keeps the major physiological processes of Habanero pepper healthy under experimental conditions.",,,,,"Canto, Azucena/ABD-3097-2020","Canto, Azucena/0000-0002-0712-2241; LARQUE SAAVEDRA, ALFONSO/0000-0001-9462-5682",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,NOV 3,2014,9,11,,,,,,,e111402,10.1371/journal.pone.0111402,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111402,,,,,,,,25365043,,,,,WOS:000345558100064,View Full Record in Web of Science

The degree of hatchery shading (70% vs. 100%) and nest depth (50 vs. 75 cm) had little influence on nest temperatures, with mean nest temperatures between 28 degrees and 28.6 degrees C in the first third of incubation (before metabolic heating of the clutch began to have an effect).

The timing of peak body temperature was 4-5 h earlier in early autumn in HF and HF x J cows relative to J cows. There was no breed difference (P >= 0.162) in daily mean body temperature except for a tendency (P=0.075) for mean body temperature to be moderately higher in J cows (38.5 degrees C during late summer compared to HF and HF x J cows (38.4 degrees C), primarily due to an increase (P= 0.001) in daily minimum body temperature (38.0 vs. 37.8 degrees C.

Here, we compare its potential as a biological control agent at high temperatures to that of Encarsia formosa (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), a wasp which is widely sold for control of T. vaporariorum. RESULTS Eretmocerus warrae attained the highest estimated developmental rate at 31.4 degrees C and the maximum oviposition rate at 30.5 degrees C. Developmental times of E. warrae at fluctuating temperatures that simulate night-day patterns were similar to those predicted based on constant temperatures. Above the optimum temperature, E. warrae tolerated higher constant temperatures than En. formosa during development and as adults. Using a ramping temperature approach, the critical thermal maximum for adult E. warrae was significantly higher than that of adult En. formosa. CONCLUSION Eretmocerus warrae is better adapted to high temperatures than En. formosa, and could therefore be a complementary or superior biological control agent during summer months in hot regions.

A.; Carazo, Pau",,,Temperature as a modulator of sexual selection,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,,,,,,,,,,,,"A central question in ecology and evolution is to understand why sexual selection varies so much in strength across taxa; it has long been known that ecological factors are crucial to this. Temperature is a particularly salient abiotic ecological factor that modulates a wide range of physiological, morphological and behavioural traits, impacting individuals and populations at a global taxonomic scale. Furthermore, temperature exhibits substantial temporal variation (e.g. daily, seasonally and inter-seasonally), and hence for most species in the wild sexual selection will regularly unfold in a dynamic thermal environment. Unfortunately, studies have so far almost completely neglected the role of temperature as a modulator of sexual selection. Here, we outline the main pathways through which temperature can affect the intensity and form (i.e. mechanisms) of sexual selection,via: (i) direct effects on secondary sexual traits and preferences (i.e. trait variance, opportunity for selection and trait-fitness covariance), and (ii) indirect effects on key mating parameters, sex-specific reproductive costs/benefits, trade-offs, demography and correlated abiotic factors. Building upon this framework, we show that, by focusing exclusively on the first-order effects that environmental temperature has on traits linked with individual fitness and population viability, current global warming studies may be ignoring eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated by sexual selection. Finally, we tested the general prediction that temperature modulates sexual selection by conducting a meta-analysis of available studies experimentally manipulating temperature and reporting effects on the variance of male/female reproductive success and/or traits under sexual selection. Our results show a clear association between temperature and sexual selection measures in both sexes. In short, we suggest that studying the feedback between temperature and sexual selection processes may be vital to developing a better understanding of variation in the strength of sexual selection in nature, and its consequences for population viability in response to environmental change (e.g. global warming).",,,,,"Garcia-Gonzalez, Francisco/A-3780-2008; Carazo, Pau/B-3311-2011","Garcia-Gonzalez, Francisco/0000-0001-9515-9038; Garcia-Roa, Roberto/0000-0002-9568-9191; Carazo, Pau/0000-0002-1525-6522",,,,,,,,,,,,,1464-7931,1469-185X,,,,DEC,2020,95,6,,,,,1607,1629,,10.1111/brv.12632,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12632,,JUL 2020,,,,,,32691483,,,,,WOS:000550400000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The times to intermediate stages (III-V) and total hatching, obtained in this study, agree with the results of previous studies undertaken some years ago. However, the times over stages IA, IB and 50% hatching indicate that development rates differed significantly between the studies; this could be related to an effect of the previous thermal history of the eggs, or to experimental biases. Daily mortality (Z) during the embryonic period was found to vary between 0.17 and 0.38, using traditional exponential decay models. The estimates of mortality rate were found to range consistently with those derived from previous studies on Northwest Atlantic mackerel eggs without predation. However, the shape of the survivorship-curve during the development pursued in this study has indicated that mortality is not constant in time. Similarly, the suitability of an exponential model to describe daily mortality should be considered. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Although the rate of heat acclimatization has received some study, little is known about how long these adaptive changes remain without continuing exposure to heat stress. This study explored the rate at which field acclimatization states are lost when temperature variability is minimized during constant submersion. California mussels (Mytilus califomianus) with different acclimatization states were collected from high- and low-zone sites (similar to 12 versus similar to 5 degrees C daily temperature ranges, respectively) and then kept submerged at 15 degrees C for 8 weeks. Each week, the cardiac thermal performance of mussels was measured as a metric of acclimatization state: critical (T-crit) and flatline (T-flat) temperatures were recorded. Over 8 weeks of constant submersion, the mean T(crit )of high-zone mussels decreased by 1.07 degrees C from baseline, but low-zone mussels' mean T-crit was unchanged. High- and low-zone mussels' mean maximum heart rate (HR) and resting HR decreased similar to 12 and 35%, respectively. T-flat was unchanged in both groups. These data suggest that T-crit and HR are more physiologically plastic in response to the narrowing of an animal's daily temperature range than T(flat )is, and that an animal's prior acclimatization state (high versus low) influences the acdimatory capacity of T-crit . Approximately 2 months were required for the cardiac thermal performance of the high-zone mussels to reach that of the low-zone mussels, suggesting that acclimatization to high and variable temperatures may persist long enough to enable these animals to cope with intermittent bouts of heat stress.",,,,,,"Somero, George/0000-0003-1431-6455; Moyen, Nicole/0000-0002-5311-0532; Denny, Mark/0000-0003-0277-9022",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUL,2020,223,13,,,,,,,jeb222893,10.1242/jeb.222893,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.222893,,,,,,,,32457061,,,,,WOS:000576693100018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The bromeliad Nidularium minutum Mez is a cold tolerant species from the Atlantic Rainforest, which grows in the subtropical latitude, where temperatures range from 2 to 30 degrees C. We hypothesized that N. minutum plants would implement rapid metabolic adjustments to ensure survival during sudden cold events that occur in seasons other than winter. N. minutum plants were cultivated at 10 degrees C. Under this condition, there was an observed increase in soluble sugar content and nitric oxide (NO) emission, as well as a high nitrate reductase (NR) activity observed within the 72 h of cold exposure, when compared with plants maintained at 25 degrees C. These responses coincided with a decrease in antioxidant activity and an increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO). After 72 h of cold exposure, a subset of plants were de-acclimated at 25 degrees C. These plants displayed reduced soluble sugar concentrations, NO emissions, NR activity and LPO. Additionally, there was an increase in anti-oxidant activity, which indicated that the plants were recovering from cold stress. Furthermore, it was found that plants maintained at 10 degrees C for 168 h acclimated to the cold by reducing the NO content and maintaining the increased sugar concentrations, thus resulting in a less intense stress response. We conclude that rapid changes in NO content, sugar concentrations and antioxidant activity are metabolic adjustments that occur during the acclimation and de-acclimation processes of this bromeliad to low temperatures. During abrupt thermal changes in subtropical regions, such adjustments could enhance cold tolerance and increase the chances of survival for this plant.",,,,,"Carvalho, Camila Pereira/Q-6912-2017; Nievola, Catarina C/L-6566-2013; Mercier, Helenice/G-2983-2012; Rodrigues, Edson/C-6792-2015","Carvalho, Camila Pereira/0000-0002-6647-2911; Mercier, Helenice/0000-0001-7431-8837; Rodrigues, Edson/0000-0003-3968-6882; Nievola, Catarina/0000-0003-0627-1357",,,,,,,,,,,,,0098-8472,1873-7307,,,,MAR,2019,159,,,,,,34,43,,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.12.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.12.004,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000458595000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A portion of statolith precipitated during the experiment was optically identified by daily increment analysis, and then subjected to Sr/Ca measurement using an electron probe micro-analyser.

Effects of daily thermal cycles are well studied and can be beneficial, increasing prey consumption and growth rates when mean and maximum temperatures of the fluctuations are at or below the species' optimum temperature.

We performed laboratory experiments to examine how two fish species (yellow perch, Perca flavescens, and walleye, Sander vitreus) with similar thermal preferences respond to chronic exposure to subdaily temperature variability. We selected temperature treatments that reflected observed thermal variation after examining water temperature data from multiple aquatic systems. We then separately exposed yellow perch and walleye to a stable 23 degrees C treatment and 12-h cycles of 23 +/- 2 degrees C or 23 +/- 4 degrees C for 45days. Adult yellow perch exposed to fluctuations of 23 +/- 4 degrees C over 12h expressed higher consumption, growth and food conversion efficiency than fish experiencing stable 23 degrees C. Temperature fluctuations, though, resulted in mortalities and the development of skin ulcers in yellow perch that did not occur under stable temperatures. In contrast, the same 12-h temperature fluctuations did not result in mortalities or stress responses in juvenile walleye. Moreover, unlike yellow perch, growth rates of walleye were lower under 12-h temperature fluctuations compared with the stable 23 degrees C treatment.

Increases in mean monthly and diurnal temperature were strongly related (R-2 = 0.70) with irradiance, indicating that PAR can be used to predict the mean warming effect of OTCs. Deeper snow trapped in OTCs also induced higher temperatures at soil/vegetation level. OTC-induced changes in the frequency of freeze-thaw events included an increase in autumn and decreases in spring and summer. Frequency of high-temperature events in OTCs increased in spring, summer and autumn compared with non-manipulated control plots. Frequency of low-temperature events was reduced by deeper snow accumulation and higher mean temperatures. The strong interactions identified between aspects of ambient environmental conditions and effects of OTCs suggest that a detailed knowledge of snow depth, temperature and irradiance levels enables us to predict how OTCs will modify the microclimate at a particular site and season. Such predictive power allows a better mechanistic understanding of observed biotic response to experimental warming studies and for more informed design of future experiments. However, a need remains to quantify OTC effects on water availability and wind speed (affecting, for example, drying rates and water stress) in combination with microclimate measurements at organism level.",,,,,"Gudmundsson, Jon/AAD-1659-2021; Bokhorst, Stef/D-1858-2009; Johnstone, Jill F./C-9204-2009; Convey, Peter/AAV-5728-2020","Gudmundsson, Jon/0000-0002-1703-8916; Johnstone, Jill F./0000-0001-6131-9339; Convey, Peter/0000-0001-8497-9903; Aerts, Rien/0000-0001-6694-0669; Jonsdottir, Ingibjorg Svala/0000-0003-3804-7077; Bokhorst, Stef/0000-0003-0184-1162; Hollister, Robert/0000-0002-4764-7691",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JAN,2013,19,1,,,,,64,74,,10.1111/gcb.12028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12028,,,,,,,,23504721,,,,,WOS:000312155100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In three experiments male British United Turkeys (BUT), from 3 to 6 weeks of age, were exposed to constant 20 degrees C, or to 35/25 degrees C or 30/20 degrees C diurnal temperature cycling, all at 50% RH and with VR (expressed as air velocity (AV)) ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 m s(-1). The 2nd and 3rd of these experiments included a positive control at constant 30 degrees C and VR of 1.5 m s(-1). Weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency were measured or calculated, as appropriate; SHL was calculated from measured surface temperature, and plasma concentrations of triiodothyronine (T-3) was determined in the 1st experiment. Changes of VR at constant 20 degrees C did not affect performance, but total SHL increased significantly with increasing VR. Under the 35/25 degrees C regime a significantly higher BW was recorded, with a similar pattern of feed efficiency, when VR during the hot part of the cycle was 1.5 or 2.0 m s(-1) than when it was 0.8 m In the 3rd experiment, BW in the 35/20 degrees C treatment was significantly lower than that of the controls. In all experiments, turkeys maintained body temperature (T-b) within the normothermic range, and SHL varied with VR. It can be concluded that although diurnal temperature cycling reflects the natural situation, exposing young turkeys to constant 30 degrees C combined with optimal ventilation might yield the best performance results.

Differences were greatest during the morning and late afternoon, with testosterone-treated males more likely to be out earlier and to stay out later. This general result was repeated in both spring and fall experiments using separate groups of males. Although testosterone-treated males were more active (i.e., out in the open) than control males, there was not a significant difference in the frequency of movements (>20 cm), nor did the groups differ in selected body temperature in their home cages. Nonetheless, testosterone-implanted males lost significantly more body mass than controls over the course of the experiments.

While ectothermic top predators may compensate by increasing foraging, ectothermic prey may be unable to increase foraging because of increased predation risk from ectothermic predators. We examined how the diurnal drift behavior (i.e., the downstream movement associated with foraging) of the mayfly Baetis, an ectothermic herbivore, responds to changing temperature in the implied presence and absence of trout, an ectothermic predator. In an experiment replicated at the catchment scale, water temperature and trout presence strongly interacted to affect the diurnal drift of Baetis from artificial channels lacking periphyton over a water temperature range of 4.2-14.8 A degrees C. In fishless streams, daytime drift increased with increasing water temperature, likely because of increased metabolic demand for food. However, in trout-bearing streams, daytime drift decreased with increasing water temperature. Our interpretation is that the perceived threat of trout rose with increasing water temperature, causing mayflies to reduce foraging despite heightened metabolic demand. These results suggest that anticipated increases in stream temperature due to climate change may further escalate divergence in structure and process between fishless and trout-bearing streams.

Threonine,ANIMAL SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two similar experiments (1 and 2) were conducted to measure the effects of a range of dietary threonine concentrations and environmental temperatures on the performance of pigs grown from 13 to 25 kg live weight. In both experiments 48 Large White X Landrace entire male pigs were assigned at 13 kg to one of six dietary threonine treatments (8.9 (T1), 7.6 (T2), 6.2 (T3), 4.9 (T4), 3.6 (T5) g/kg and T5 + supplemented threonine (T6)) and one of four temperature treatments (18, 22, 26 and 30 degrees C). Animals were given ad libitum access to food until 25 kg live weight. There were significant interactions (P < 0.05) between temperature and threonine content on the rate of growth (ADG) with the highest gains on T1 and at 22 degrees C. Similarly the response in food intake (FI) to dietary threonine pins significantly (P < 0.01) modified by the ambient temperature. An increase in the supply of threonine in the diet resulted in significant increases (P < 0.001) in the gain per unit of food (FCE). A similar response to temperature occurred with the highest FCE recorded at 26 degrees C and the lowest at 18 degrees C. There was a 0.20 proportional reduction in body protein content at 25 kg live weight in pigs given T5 compared with those given T1 and similarly, excluding T6 because threonine may nor have been the most limiting amino acid, the fat content was 1.37 higher for pigs on T5 versus T1, which had the lowest fat content. Similar trends occurred in protein and lipid growth rates with maximum protein deposition recorded on T1 (86 (s.e. 3.5) g/day) and maximum lipid deposition on T5 (108 (s.e. 5.8)g/day), over all temperatures. The response in total heat loss was similar to that observed in FI with the effect of decreasing threonine content being dependent on the environmental temperature. Linens regression of daily empty body threonine accretion on daily digestible threonine intake showed an average efficiency of threonine utilization for pigs between 12 kg and 25 kg live weight of 0.59 (s.e. 0.03). There were no differences in efficiency between temperatures. In conclusion, decreasing the threonine concentration below the requirement of the animal resulted in a significant decrease in ADG, reduced FCE and fatter animals. Pigs given a diet deficient in threonine will attempt to maintain threonine intake as the concentration declines by increasing food intake but this compensation is dependent on the environmental temperature. Pigs are able to compensate better for a deficiency in threonine at 18 degrees C and 22 degrees C than at higher temperatures due to the animals being able to dissipate more heat at the lower temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1357-7298,,,,,APR,2000,70,,2,,,,287,297,,10.1017/S1357729800054746,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1357729800054746,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000086848400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Relationships to annual fluctuations of scrotal surface temperature and temperature-humidity index,THERIOGENOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The objective of the present study was to explore the potential relationships of ovine sperm chromatin integrity, quantified using the sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA), to the heat load of the scrotum and the discomfort felt by the animals because of fluctuations of microclimatic factors at different time periods before ejaculation. Ejaculates were. collected once per week from five Chios rams and four East Friesian rams for 12 months and stored in liquid nitrogen. Frozen-thawed semen samples were analyzed using the SCSA, to determine the DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and the percentage of cells outside the main sperm population (%DFI) in each one of the samples. Scrotal surface temperature (SST) of each ram was measured using an infrared thermometer on a daily basis. Ambient air temperature and relative humidity were recorded at hourly intervals throughout the experimental period and temperature-humidity index (THI) was used to assess the discomfort felt by the rams. Mean values of SST (SSTmean) and THI (THImean) were computed for eight different time periods (up to 61 days) preceding each ejaculation day (Day 0). A linear mixed-effect model analysis was performed to describe the relation of SCSA parameters to collection month, SSTmean, and THImean of different time periods before ejaculation. The results of the statistical analysis revealed a relation of %DFI to the SSTmean of the last 12 days preceding ejaculation, namely the period that resembled the phase of epididymal maturation. On the contrary, the variation of DFI was most adequately described by the linear mixed-effect model applied for Days 54 to 48 before ejaculation, which resembled the phase of spermatogonial mitoses. The effect of collection month was significant for DFI and %DFI, with semen samples collected in September and February exhibiting the lowest DFI values; a less profound seasonal pattern was detected for %DFI. The effect of THImean on DFI and %DFI was proven nonsignificant in regard to all time periods. In conclusion, a relation of SCSA parameters to SSTmean of different periods before ejaculation was shown in the present study, implying an effect of scrotal microenvironment on intratesticular and epididymal sperm population. In contrast, we failed to detect any effect of microclimate-induced discomfort felt by the animals on the chromatin integrity of frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Gravid females and adult males were inoculated in petri dishes containing agar layers of nine (for P. marina) or five (for D. meyli) different salinities, from almost freshwater to higher than marine, and incubated at a temperature of 20 degrees C, to study the impact of salinity; agar layers with a salinity of 20 parts per thousand, incubated under each of six different temperatures from 5 to 30 degrees C, served to study the effect of temperature. Daily and total fecundity, development time and sex ratio were quantified, and preadult mortality was estimated. The results are compared to those of a partner study on the influence of salinity and temperature on respiration, assimilation and scope for production in the same nematode species. Salinity had relatively minor effects on fecundity, development times and sex ratio in both species, but strongly impacted juvenile viability at the extremes of the salinity range: at salinities close to 0 and 40 parts per thousand, preadult mortality was more than 80% in P, marina; it was 100% at 5 parts per thousand in D, meyli. Both species had an (near) optimal fitness at salinities of 10 to 30 parts per thousand. Temperature had a pronounced influence on both nematodes over the entire range studied. Diplolaimelloides meyli still reproduced acid matured at temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C, while P. marina had an upper temperature limit for reproduction of 25 degrees C. Development times of D. meyli were more temperature-dependent than those of P. marina: the mean development time from adult to adult for the latter nematode ranged from 2 days at 25 degrees C to 7 days at 9 degrees C. The development time of D. meyli increased from 7 days at 25-30 degrees C to 63 days at 10 degrees C, temperature below which no reproduction occurred. Female-biased sex ratios were found in D. meyli at low temperatures and in P. marina under optimal salinity conditions. The Life history results largely agree with the predicted scope for production, but discrepancies were found near the extremes of the abiotic range of both species. It is emphasized that the ranges observed are characteristic of populations, not of species; they may to an extent have been influenced by culture conditions. A comparison of the present results with literature data on other P. marina populations demonstrates that some populations of this species may still reproduce successfully under conditions which are lethal to other populations, raising the question as to whether cryptic species rather than populations of a single species are involved.

Maximum water temperatures declined significantly in the shaded reach, but minimum and mean temperatures were not modified. Heat budget calculations before shading show the dominance of solar energy as an influence of stream temperature.

Maximum temperatures in the upstream bedrock reach were up to 8.6degreesC higher and 3.4 degreesC lower than downstream in the alluvial reach. Better understanding of factors that influence not only maximum but minimum temperatures as well as diurnal temperature variation will highlight types of reaches in which stream temperature would be most responsive to changes in shading.

Climate models provide useful tools for studying underlying processes and amplifying effects associated with extremes. The Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS) has recently been coupled to the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model. We examine how this model represents climate extremes derived by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and compare them to observational data sets using the AMIP framework. We find that the patterns of extreme indices are generally well represented. Indices based on percentiles are particularly well represented and capture the trends over the last 60 years shown by the observations remarkably well. The diurnal temperature range is underestimated, minimum temperatures (T-MIN) during nights are generally too warm and daily maximum temperatures (T-MAX) too low in the model. The number of consecutive wet days is overestimated, while consecutive dry days are underestimated. The maximum consecutive 1-day precipitation amount is underestimated on the global scale. Biases in T-MIN correlate well with biases in incoming longwave radiation, suggesting a relationship with biases in cloud cover. Biases in T-MAX depend on biases in net shortwave radiation as well as evapotranspiration. The regions and season where the bias in evapotranspiration plays a role for the T-MAX bias correspond to regions and seasons where soil moisture availability is limited.

Knowledge is scarce about actual energetic costs that can be associated with internal acclimatization processes as a response to thermal extremes. In the present study changes in cellular energy allocation, oxygen consumption rate and energy related enzymes' activity (IDH and LDH) were measured in juvenile H. scabra, held at different temperatures: 21, 27 and 33 degrees C. The results showed that the steady temperature change (1 degrees C/day) to both temperature treatments, until reaching the testing temperatures (day 0), clearly affected cellular energy consumption and available energy reserves, measured in the respiratory tree and muscle tissue, respectively. However, 15 and 30 days after acclimation, the initial differences in cellular energy allocation between treatments decreased. In contrast to the variations measured in cellular energy allocation, oxygen consumption was highest at 33 degrees C and lowest at 21 degrees C at all three measurement times. Moreover, a significant positive correlation between oxygen consumption rate and temperature was detected at day 15 and day 30. Likewise, a shift from anaerobic to aerobic energy metabolism, indicated by changes in LDH and IDH activities, was observed in the animals from the warm temperature treatment. Results imply that juvenile H. scabra were able to recover from initial disturbances in energy balance, caused by the incremental temperature change of +/- 6 degrees C. Over the experimental period of 30 days, elevated temperature did however, lead to a metabolic shift and more efficient energy turnover, indicated by changes in oxygen consumption rate, LDH and IDH. The synergy of cellular energy allocation and oxygen consumption proved to be a viable indicator to assess the capability of sea cucumbers like H. scabra to cope with extreme temperature conditions. Surprisingly, juvenile H. scabra were able to sustain their energy balance and oxygen consumption rate within the homeostatic range, even at 33 degrees C. Thus, we assume that rearing temperatures of 33 degrees C might be possible, which could improve aquaculture production of H. scabra. However, further research is required to understand the mechanisms and effects of acclimation under aquaculture conditions. Statement of relevance: The sea cucumber H. scabra is considered a promising aquaculture candidate in the tropics. The commercial interest in H. scabra has led to a great number of attempts to culture this species e.g. in Madagascar, Tanzania, India and Indonesia, where the farming of this species also showed a great potential to increase the livelihood of the local community. Although, considerable research effort has been put into the advancement of the production cycle, fundamental knowledge, e.g. on physiological adjustments due to suboptimal rearing conditions, remains scarce for H. scabra. Water temperature has been identified as crucial factor, determining production efficiency. In our manuscript we introduce an innovative approach, for the assessment of shifts in the energy budget as well as in metabolic pathways, to detect thermal stress in juvenile H. scabra. Our results show that the combined application of cellular energy allocation (CEA) and measurement of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as well as the activity of two metabolic key enzymes: iso-citrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is a strong analytical tool to evaluate whole animal homeostasis under thermal extremes. To our knowledge this is the first study in which the method of CEA was optimized for the application on isolated muscle and respiratory tree tissue of a sea cucumber, like H. scabra. Hence, our results provide original insights into the thermal acclimation physiology of H. scabra, which provides crucial knowledge for setting up optimal culture conditions for this highly valuable aquaculture candidate. Moreover, our results show that juvenile H. scabra were strongly affected by rapid temperature changes, exhibiting distinct differences in metabolic adjustments as response to short-term cold and warm acclimation, but were able to restore homeostatic conditions at constant cold and warm temperature extremes. Concerning aquaculture practices, these findings imply that CEA might be a good condition indicator to evaluate the overall metabolic status in sea cucumbers. Moreover, rapid temperature fluctuations seem to provoke much higher energetic costs in juvenile H. scabra than constant extreme temperature conditions, which is important to consider in daily management practices. The OCR revealed an enhanced metabolism at warmer temperature conditions, throughout the entire experimental period. Likewise, the warm exposed animals were shifting their energy turnover from a more anaerobic to a more aerobic state, indicated by changes in LDH and IDH activities, and showed increased foraging activity at all times. The combined outcome of CEA, OCR and activities of energy metabolism related enzymes indicates, that the increased metabolic activity in juvenile H. scabra, as response to warmer temperature, was well within the homeostatic range. Thus, contrary to our expectations, a rearing temperature of up to 33 degrees C might presumably be favourable for the aquaculture of H. scabra. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For temperature experiments, ten 24 hour trials were conducted each at 10.5degreesC and 7degreesC, using flow-through respirometry. Average routine VO2 was approximately 130 mg O-2/(kg*hr) at 10.5degreesC and approximately 120 mg O-2/(kg*hr) at 7degreesC. These values did not differ significantly, probably because we used temperatures spanning the thermal range of bloater, within which this species may conserve routine metabolism. Derivations of daily food ration for bloater were calculated and compared with a previous bioenergetics model. For pressure experiments, the diel vertical migrations bloater undertake in the wild were simulated using a flow-through respirometer that could be pressurized. Ten 3-day trials were conducted, consisting of an overnight acclimation to the respirometer, a 12-hour pressure regime, and a day of recovery. The pressure regime involved a compression from 1 atm (atmospheric pressure) to 4 atm over 6 hours and a subsequent decompression of the same magnitude and duration. Increases in hydrostatic pressure elicited a rise in bloater VO2 and motor activity; conversely, the subsequent decrease in hydrostatic pressure caused a return of oxygen uptake and motor activity to baseline values at I atm. We hypothesize that pressure-induced compression of the gas bladder explain the changes in VO2, because increased swimming (causing increased VO2) is needed to maintain station when the swimbladder is compressed.",,,,,"stevens, don/AAI-6983-2021; Stevens, Ernest/G-9569-2014","Stevens, Ernest/0000-0002-3113-1543; Speers-Roesch, Ben/0000-0001-6510-7501",,,,,,,,,,,,,0380-1330,,,,,,2004,30,1,,,,,70,81,,10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70330-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70330-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000220858500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lake temperatures measured at a resolution of 2 min at 15 depths ranging from 0.2 to 43 m, which were observed during the 6 July-5 November 2018 period, were analyzed. The results show thermocline deepening from 10 m at the beginning of the observation period to 16 m at the end of the observation period, where the latter depth corresponds to approximately one-third of the lake depth. The pycnocline followed the same pattern, except that the deepening occurred throughout the entire period approximately 1 m above the thermocline. On average, thermocline deepening was 3-4 cm d(-1), while the maximum deepening (12.5 cm d(-1)) co-incided with the occurrence of internal seiches. Furthermore, the results indicate three different types of forcings on the lake surface; two of these forcings have diurnal periodicity - (1) continuous heat fluxes and (2) occasional periodic stronger winds - whereas forcing (3) corresponds to occasional nonperiodic stronger winds with steady along-basin directions. Continuous heat fluxes (1) produced forced diurnal oscillations in the lake temperature within the first 5 m of the lake throughout the entire observation period. Non-continuous periodic stronger winds (2) resulted in occasional forced diurnal oscillations in the lake temperatures at depths from approximately 7 to 20 m. Occasional strong and steady along-basin winds (3) triggered both baroclinic internal seiches with a principal period of 8.0 h and barotropic surface seiches with a principal period of 9 min Lake currents produced by the surface seiches under realistic-topography conditions generated baroclinic oscillations of the thermocline region (at depths from 9 to 17 m) with periods corresponding to the period of surface seiches 9 approximate to min), which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported in previous lake studies.",,,,,"Klaic, Zvjezdana z/K-7301-2012","Klaic, Zvjezdana/0000-0002-8426-9351; Babic, Karmen/0000-0002-4878-6167",,,,,,,,,,,,,1027-5606,1607-7938,,,,JUL 3,2020,24,7,,,,,3399,3416,,10.5194/hess-24-3399-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3399-2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000547403100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the first experiment, eggshell temperature (ET) in the control group was kept constant at 37.8 degrees C, and embryos in the experimental group were exposed to varying ET within the range of 36.8 to 38.8 degrees C using ET steps of 0.2 degrees C and time steps of 3 h. This was repeated in 3 periods between 6.5 and 9.5 d, 10.5 and 13.5 d, and 14.5 and 17.5 d. In the studied ET range, heat production (HP) increased linearly at 4.9% per 1 C ET. In the second experiment, a standard machine temperature (MT) was used for the control group, and eggs in the experimental group were exposed to low (MT - 0.3 degrees C) or high (MT + 0.3 degrees C) temperatures for 1 h of time at d 8, 9, and 11 to 16. When MT was decreased, CO2 production initially increased at 0.5% and decreased thereafter. When MT was increased, CO2 production initially decreased at 0.4% and increased thereafter. It was concluded that embryonic HP responded linearly with short-term ET changes in the studied ET range of 36.8 to 38.8 degrees C. Changes in CO2 concentration due to short-term MT changes could not be explained by embryonic HP only. It can be speculated that blood flow through the chorio-allantoic membrane changes with MT, affecting heat transfer and diffusion of CO2. A second, delayed response to MT changes was in accordance with the findings in Experiment 1. Within the studied temperature range it will be difficult to use embryonic metabolic responses as a tool to control the incubation process. Because HP is linearly related to ET as in the studied temperature range, other factors such as O-2 availability or CO2 release may limit embryo development at higher ET.

Such rapid increase during the crop growth stages, particularly during extremely sensitive reproductive and early grain-filling stages of rice (Oryza sativa L), leads to reduced biomass, grain yield and quality. Field experiments and lab analyses were carried out using three Basmati and two non-Basmati cultivars to study the effect of a wide range of diurnal temperatures and radiation. Night temperature had a significant negative effect on grain yield (P < 0.001) and quality (P < 0.01) beyond 22 degrees C. Reduced spikelet fertility followed by grain weight plant(-1) accounted for the decline in yield. Radiation however had a positive influence on yield and grain quality. A definite relationship between maximum day temperature and grain yield could not be established as the temperatures were generally <= the critical 35 degrees C during sensitive developmental stages. Environment 4 gave significantly highest yield, indicating a narrow window of optimum growing conditions for better yield and quality. Hence, increasing diurnal temperature tolerance in rice is a sustainable approach than altering well established cropping patterns, which will inevitably lead to yield penalties.

This is particularly true of oviparous species where development typically occurs outside of the female, and studies have shown that traits such as survival and behavior can be altered by both temperature and exposure to steroid hormones during development. In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), the fate of gonadal development can be affected by temperature and by maternal estrogens present in the egg at oviposition, and there is evidence that these factors can affect gene expression patterns. Here, we explored how thermal fluctuations and exposure to an estrogen metabolite, estrone sulfate, affect the expression of several genes known to be involved in sexual differentiation: Kdm6b, Dmrt1, Sox9, FoxL2 and Cyp19A1. We found that most of the genes responded to both temperature and estrone sulfate exposure, but that the responses to these factors were not identical, in that estrone sulfate effects occur downstream of temperature effects.

Within lakes, significant day-to-day differences in respiration were common despite large uncertainties in estimated rates on some lake-days. Daily variation in GPP explained 5% to 85% of the daily variation in respiration after temperature correction. Respiration was tightly coupled to GPP at a daily scale in oligotrophic and dystrophic lakes, and more weakly coupled in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes.

We analyzed >= 48 years of records from 186 climate stations of Mainland China to estimate the annual probabilities of reaching the lower lethal temperature for S. incertulas. The relevant climatic metric, minimum annual temperature, approximated a normal distribution. Consequently, the probability density function for any site could be characterized with the mean and standard deviation of minimum annual temperatures. We used the local regression method to map the mean and standard deviation of minimum annual temperatures throughout Mainland China and then calculated isolines representing annual probabilities for reaching or exceeding the lower lethal temperature of S. incertulas. In addition, we calculated and mapped the number of generations per year based on the annual accumulative degree days and the sum of effective temperatures required to complete one generation. The empirical northern distribution limits of S. incertulas were generally congruent with the theoretical limits based on winter survival, with exceptions within the Shandong and Sichuan provinces, which are apparently thermally suitable but where the host plant is not cultivated. The expected number of generations per year was 3-5 within most of the range of S. incertulas in China. In central China, the expected number of generations per year was about 3.

As thermal tolerances form an important component of a species' niche, changes to the temperature regime have the capacity to negatively impact species, and therefore, the diversity of the communities they inhabit. In this study, we used protist microcosms to assess how mean temperature, as well as temporal variation in temperature, affected diversity. Communities consisted of seven species in a multitrophic food web. Each ecosystem was inoculated with the same abundances of each species at the start of the experiment, and species densities, Hill's numbers (based on Shannon diversity), the number of extinctions, and the probability the microcosm contained predators were all calculated at the end of the experiment. To assess how mean temperature and temperature fluctuations affect stability, we also measured population densities through time. We found that increased temporal variation in temperature increased final densities, increased Hill's numbers (at low mean temperatures), decreased rates of extinctions, and increased the probability that predators survived till the end of the experiment. Mean temperatures did not significantly affect either the number of extinctions or the probability of predators, but did reduce the positive effect of increased temporal variation in temperature on overall diversity. Our results indicate that climatic changes have the potential to impact the composition of ecological communities by altering multiple components of temperature regimes. However, given that some climate forecasts are predicting increased mean temperatures and reduced variability, our finding that increased mean temperature and reduced temporal variation are both generally associated with negative consequences is somewhat concerning.",,,,,"Hammill, Edd/F-9030-2013","Hammill, Edd/0000-0001-8247-6106",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,FEB,2022,12,2,,,,,,,e8665,10.1002/ece3.8665,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8665,,,,,,,,35228865,,,,,WOS:000760366500075,View Full Record in Web of Science

This rate is very similar to those associated with hydropeaking waves in rivers in the same watershed as the experimental flumes. Although the achieved changes in temperature were within a tolerability range for benthic invertebrates, their drift increased threefold and fivefold, and twofold and fourfold in the two cold and two warm thermopeaking experiments, respectively. Assemblage composition of drift before and during the experiment differed, indicating that some taxa respond to abrupt thermal alterations. Larvae of Chironomidae, Simuliidae and Baetidae were the most abundant drifting taxa in all experiments during temperature alterations. The drift induced was probably behavioural, given the immediate responses of invertebrates that begun to drift within 2?min from the start of the simulations. This type of drift differs from catastrophic drift that usually occurs as a response to hydropeaking. The two types of drift can occur as distinct events in streams impacted by hydropower plants with high-elevation reservoirs and hypolimnetic releases because the propagation of the discharge and thermal waves are asynchronous, causing the benthic community to undergo two distinct but consecutive impacts. Our results suggest that the long-term effects of thermopeaking are mixed and synergical with those caused by hydropeaking and, on the long term, may alter the longitudinal distribution of benthic communities.

In this study, we used observational and experimental approaches to investigate the role of temperature and interspecific competition in controlling the structure of ground-foraging ant communities in forests of the Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon. To assess the potential role of competition, we first Used null model analyses to ask whether species partition temporal and/or spatial environments. TO understand how thermal tolerances influence the structure Of Communities, we conducted a laboratory experiment to estimate the maximum thermal tolerance of workers and a field experiment in which we added shaded microhabitats and monitored the response of foragers. Finally, to evaluate the roles of temperature and interspecific competition in the field, we simultaneously manipulated shading and the presence of a dominant competitor (Formica moki). The foraging activity of species broadly overlapped during the diurnal range of temperatures. Species co-occurrence patterns varied across the diurnal temperature range: species were spatially segregated at bait stations at low temperatures, but co-occurred randomly at high temperatures. The decreased abundance of the co-occurring themophilic Temnothorax nevadensis in shaded plots was a direct effect of shading and not an indirect effect of competitive interactions. Thermal tolerance predicted the response of ant species to the shading experiment: species with the lowest tolerances to high temperatures showed the greatest increase ill abundance in the shaded plots. Moreover, species with more similar thermal tolerance values segregated more frequently oil baits than did species that differed in their thermal tolerances. Collectively, our results suggest that thermal tolerances of ants may mediate competitive effects in habitats that experience strong diurnal temperature fluctuations.",,,,,"Sanders, Nathan/A-6945-2009; Sanders, Nathan/ABE-4335-2020","Sanders, Nathan/0000-0001-6220-6731; Ellison, Aaron/0000-0003-4151-6081",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,MAR,2010,119,3,,,,,551,559,,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17792.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17792.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000275826200017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Herd records collected from Holstein heifers (n = 348) and dry cows (n = 503; second through seventh lactations) were fitted with SensOor ear tags to collect hourly ear-surface temperatures. Mean temperatures were calculated from 240 hourly measures during Days 230-239 of gestation and cows within season were grouped into two median temperature groups. On Days 230-239 of gestation during May through September (hotter months) cows with high (H, range of 33.67-38.89 degrees C, mean +/- SEM = 32.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C) or medium high (MH, 25.06 -31.66 degrees C, 29.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C) temperatures were grouped together (n = 209 per group). For comparable gestational days during October through April (colder months), cows with medium low (ML, 17.82 -25.00 degrees C, 21.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C) and low (L,-0.70 to 17.80 degrees C, 13.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C) temperatures were grouped together (n = 216 per group). Prepartum traits including mean ear temperature, gestation length, days in milk at dry-off, days in close-up pen, previous 305-d milk yield, proportion of heifer calves born, and cow PTA for milk differed (P < 0.05) between seasons, but not between temperature groups within season, except predicted transmitting ability for milk was greater (P = 0.02) for ML than L cows. Postpartum treatment with antimicrobials occurred more (P = 0.02) often in H than MH cows, whereas more (P = 0.04) lameness and greater (P = 0.05) projected 305-d mature equivalent milk yield was observed in ML vs. L cows. No other health or reproductive traits were associated with temperature group, but many seasonal effects were observed across temperature groups. Less (P = 0.04) prepartum eating time during the last 10 d before calving was detected in L than in ML cows, less (P = 0.06) rumination time in ML than L cows, and more (P = 0.03) activity time was observed in H than MH cows. After calving, H cows were more (P = 0.03) active than MH cows and ML cows tended (P = 0.07) to be more active than L cows.

High temperature stress conditions,AGRONOMY JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"High soil temperatures are a significant constraint to crop establishment, Exposure of preemergent maize (Zea mays L.) to temperatures in excess of 40 degrees C stops shoot elongation and may also damage the seedling, reducing subsequent shoot growth in the physiological temperature range (9 to 40 degrees C). At present, there is little quantitative understanding of the effects of high temperature stress on preemergent maize shoot growth. Consequently, existing maize emergence or preemergent maize shoot growth models are restricted to the physiological temperature range. The work described in this paper quantified the effect of supramaximum temperatures (temperatures greater than 40 degrees C) on maize shoot growth, and in particular on its component parts, the coleoptile and first internode, The major impact of supramaximum temperatures on shoot growth was due to a severe reduction in the first internode growth rate, which was correlated with the maximum temperature reached during the day. We also found that, under diurnally varying temperature conditions, coleoptile growth ceased only at 45 degrees C, rather than at 40 degrees C as found previously in constant temperature experiments. Inhibition of shoot growth due to high temperature damage was alleviated when seedlings were grown in the physiological temperature range for 33 h. Based on these findings, a model was developed that can predict shout growth of seedlings exposed to supramaximum temperatures, The model successfully predicted shoot growth of seedlings exposed to supramaximum temperatures as a part of the diurnal cycle.

Laboratory seed germination experiments were conducted on both smutgrass varieties to determine the effect of various environmental factors on germination and emergence. The average germination rate for both varieties was 88% at 30/20 C day/night temperatures. Seed germination for both varieties was greater under simulated temperature flux than at constant temperatures. Seed of both varieties germinated at four simulated Florida temperature fluxes (22/11, 27/15, 33/24, and 29/19 C day/night), although the germination of small smutgrass and giant smutgrass was reduced at 33/24 and 22/11 C, respectively. Germination of small and giant smutgrass under dark conditions was 27 and 53%, respectively. Both smutgrass varieties germinated over a wide range of pH values. Small and giant smutgrass germination was inhibited at water potentials below -0.2 MPa and when small smutgrass seed was placed below the soil surface. Emergence of giant smutgrass seed did not occur below 3 cm. Both smutgrass varieties germinated over a broad range of environmental conditions, indicating their capability of year-round germination; however, germination is only likely to occur under field conditions during the summer growing season when rainfall is prevalent. These results indicate that both species have the ability to germinate over a wide range of environmental conditions but that germination is inhibited by moisture stress and depth of burial. Considering that giant smutgrass prefers higher temperatures than small smutgrass, the advent of rainfall from June through September is conducive for germination.

Mammals inhabiting the subterranean ecotope can adapt their digging and foraging activity in shallow tunnels temporarily to periods with favourable ambient air and soil temperatures. Moreover, subterranean mammals have the unique opportunity to select for their nests in soil depths with certain, daily and seasonally constant temperatures. Our knowledge on nest temperatures in several species of subterranean mammals is based on measurements of temperatures in empty nests. We can expect, however, that the temperature in an occupied nest is higher (due to the igloo effect). We performed two experiments regarding the temperature preference in five species of African mole-rats (Bathyergidae, Rodentia: Fukomys anselli, E mechowii, E micklemi, Heliophobius argenteocinereus, and Heterocephalus glaber). In a first experiment, the animals were tested pairwise (except for the solitary silvery mole-rats, H. argenteocinereus, that were tested singly) in an apparatus consisting of seven chambers with a temperature gradient ranging between 16 and 37 degrees C (air temperature). While the smaller species ( < 110 g; E anselli, E micklemi, H. glaber) chose chambers with average air temperatures around 29 degrees C, the larger mole-rats rested preferably at lower temperatures of approximately 25.6 degrees C (F. mechowii) and 27.7 degrees C (H. argenteocinereus). A strong negative correlation between body mass and preferred air temperature was detected across species. Thus, the results comply with the surface-volume-rule. Contrary to expectations, temperature preference of naked mole-rats (H. glaber) did not deviate from those of furred small mole-rats, but followed the general trend with smaller species preferring higher temperatures. In a second experiment, Ansell's mole-rats (E anselli) were tested in groups of four, six and nine animals and the preferred temperatures were compared to the values obtained for pairs. The preferred mean air temperatures did not differ among the groups of different sizes. We discuss our finding's in the light of ecophysiological adaptations to cope with the ambient conditions proposed by the thermal stress hypothesis. Furthermore, we suggest that while soil temperature is decisive during digging as the mole-rats warm up or cool due to tight contact between body and soil (conduction), resting animals prevent heat loss through conduction by building a nest.

In deep lakes that thermally stratify, M. relicta spends most of the time on or near the lake bottom in cold water where food resources are low; but, M. relicta migrates daily into warmer layers to feed where food resources are more abundant. Hence, in deep lakes M. relicta traverses steep temperature and prey density gradients while migrating through the water column to forage. We conducted a laboratory growth experiment of factorial design that simulated the range of temperatures and densities of natural zooplankton forage encountered by M. relicta during DVM. Somatic growth, measured as change in total length and lipid-free biomass, was not significantly different among experimental treatments. Analysis of variance showed that M. relicta stored energy in the form of lipid instead of using the energy mainly to drive increased somatic growth, but only at the colder temperatures. Lipid storage was 24% (+/- 4.3 sd) in 4 degrees C-high forage treatment compared to 6% (+/- 1.1) at 14 degrees C-high forage treatment. Energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of M. relicta was highest (21.3% +/- 5.8) at 4 degrees C and lowest (3.3% +/- 0.9) at 14 degrees C, regardless of prey density. The experiment showed that Mysis relicta feeds at high food densities where ECE is low, but spends most of the time in colder water where ECE is high. These results support McLaren's metabolic efficiency hypothesis, which predicts that feeding in the more productive surface waters and then migrating to colder waters is reproductively advantageous. Moreover, owing to high metabolic efficiency in the coldest waters and rapid DVM, M. relicta is able to sequester much of the epilimnetic zooplankton production near or on the lake bottom, thereby forcing the lake food web toward a configuration dominated by mysids, benthic or deepwater fishes and small, agile zooplankton.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-8158,,,,,,1999,412,,,,,,155,164,,10.1023/A:1003886920400,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003886920400,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000084827100017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The cardinal temperature for B. bassiana conidial germination and hyphal development was approximately 35 degrees C. A low prevalence of mycosis (less than or equal to 7%) was observed in inoculated nymphs exposed to a continuous temperature of 35 and 40 degrees C, whereas continuous exposure to 30 degrees C did not have a significant effect on disease development. Daily exposures to 35 and 40 degrees C for 1 and 6 h, respectively, decreased mycosis in nymphs. In both environments, a strong correlation (r greater than or equal to 0.95) was observed between hyphal growth on potato dextrose agar and final mycosis, Although high temperatures delayed conidial germination, only conidia exposed to continuous 35 or to 40 degrees C for more than 8 h exhibited reduced germination after 24 h, The effects of temperature on conidial germination were poorly correlated with disease, and when nymphs were exposed to 35 degrees C for 24 h, less mycosis was observed only in grasshoppers exposed between 1 and 2 days postinoculation. The thoracic temperature of nymphs permitted to bask adjacent to a heat source ranged from 38 to 42 degrees C, In nymphs basking for 1 h per day, 46% less mycosis was observed, decreasing to 98% less disease in nymphs allowed to bask for 6 h or greater per day. On a heat gradient, a higher prevalence of B. bassiana-infected nymphs selected hotter positions than noninfected nymphs, suggesting a ''behavioral fever'' response to infection. This study indicates that high temperature and thermoregulation can adversely affect B. bassiana mycosis of grasshoppers and may explain the poor efficacy of this entomopathogen observed in some held experiments.

Air temperature fluctuations in the exposed head space of the tensiometer can cause large air pressure changes leading to misinterpretation of the soil water potential. Treating the tensiometer head space as an ideal gas with water vapor in dynamic equilibrium, a set of coupled equations is derived that describes the relationship between head space air pressure, the rate of temperature change, the conductance of the tensiometer cup, and the head space volume. The interaction of these factors is illustrated through a series of simulations and then demonstrated with laboratory and field experiments. Air pressure deviations as large as +/-80% were observed in tensiometers of low cup conductance and large head space when exposed to rapid temperature change. When the temperature change is slow relative to the cup conductance, changes in air-pocket pressure are corrected by water now across the cup, and interpretation errors are small, Air pressure deviations from both rapid and slow temperature change may be estimated with the simulation equations using an approximation for the water pressure gradient across the tensiometer cup. The most practical outcome of this research is the theoretical and experimental confirmation that air temperature effects are reduced by maintaining high water levels in the tensiometer (that is, minimizing the air-pocket volume) and by maximizing the tensiometer cup conductance. In the field, insulating or shading tensiometers reduces temperature-related errors in general but may aggravate the problem if removal of the insulation (as might be necessary to read the tensiometer) causes a sudden temperature change in the air-pocket.",,,,,"Cardon, Grant/O-4863-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-075X,,,,,SEP,1998,163,9,,,,,677,685,,10.1097/00010694-199809000-00001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-199809000-00001,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000076172700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Molecular understanding of how noisy temperature cues are registered has emerged from dissection of vernalization in Arabidopsis, which involves a multiphase cold-dependent silencing of the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Cold-induced transcriptional silencing precedes a low probability PRC2 epigenetic switching mechanism. The epigenetic switch requires the absence of warm temperatures as well as long-term cold exposure. However, the natural temperature inputs into the earlier transcriptional silencing phase are less well understood. Here, through investigation of Arabidopsis accessions in natural and climatically distinct field sites, we show that the first seasonal frost strongly induces expression of COOLAIR, the antisense transcripts at FLC. Chamber experiments delivering a constant mean temperature with different fluctuations showed the freezing induction of COOLAIR correlates with stronger repression of FLC mRNA. Identification of a mutant that ectopically activates COOLAIR revealed how COOLAIR up-regulation can directly reduce FLC expression. Consistent with this, transgenes designed to knockout COOLAIR perturbed the early phase of FLC silencing. However, all transgenes designed to remove COOLAIR resulted in increased production of novel convergent FLC antisense transcripts.

Changes in skin and ambient temperature strongly influenced the proportion of ticks that successfully engorged, the time required for engorgement, and weight of engorged ticks, and they had a weaker influence on the proportion of dead ticks. The relationships between the tick engorgement parameters and ambient temperature differed between the experiments using either Angus or Holstein cattle. The differences between experiments were reduced when expressed in relation to skin temperature, suggesting that the thermal environment of the breeds is an important characteristic determining engorgement success.

The aim of this study was to identify the fundamental niche of both species in their natural habitat, and to investigate the relative importance of food and abiotic factors in determining presence and success of nematode species in the highly dynamic estuarine tidal environments of macrophyte detrital habitats. Of the three factors studied, salinity least impacted P. marina and D, meyli. Respiration and assimilation in both species showed only minor variation in the salinity range of 10 to 30 parts per thousand. Respiration decreased at marine salinities in P. marina, and increased in both species at oligohaline salinities down to a stress-induced maximum around a salinity of 5 parts per thousand, then steeply declined towards freshwater conditions. Temperature heavily affected both species, but Q(10)-values in D. meyli were considerably higher than in P. marina, suggesting the former species to be particularly well adapted to fine-tuning its energy expenditure as a function of temperature. The highest respiration and assimilation rates in both species were at 25 degrees C. At still higher temperatures, metabolic rates were depressed, but while P. marina was entirely inactivated above 30 degrees C, D. meyli continued to respire and assimilate food up to 35 degrees C. The scope for production, calculated as the net difference between assimilation and respiration rates (both expressed in units of C), was 0 at 5 degrees C and increased to a maximum at 25 degrees C in both nematodes; it declined at higher temperatures, but remained positive up to 35 degrees C in D. meyli. Significant food assimilation in both nematodes occurred only at bacterial densities above 10(8) cells ml(-1). Assimilation rate reached a maximum at 5 x 10(8) cells ml(-1) in D. meyli, and remained constant at higher densities. P. marina, by contrast, had a well defined peak assimilation at a food density of 2.5 x 10(9) cells ml(-1), with lower rates at both lower and higher food densities. This contrasts with observations on ingestion rate, and suggests a food density-dependent assimilation efficiency. The present results suggest that tolerances of exposure to salinity and temperature extremes on a daily rather than seasonal basis, may be of higher significance in niche differentiation between both species. Their fundamental niche further appears to be determined by the range of (near) optimal food conditions, which is narrow in P. marina but comparatively broader in D. meyli.

However, 22 degrees C slowed the growth and delayed the larval development by about 2-4 days. Growth rate at 30 degrees C (0.44-0.48 mm day(-1)) was double of that (0.22-0.25 mm day(-1)) at 22 degrees C. The results showed that P. semisulcatus is tolerant to low, rather than to high temperatures during the larval development. Hence, a water temperature; level of about 30 degrees C is optimal for the larval culture of this species. The second experiment showed that temperature exerted a greater influence than the salinity on the growth and survival during the larval development. The range of temperature in which the larvae showed high survival and growth is relatively narrow as compared to that of salinity.

We have analyzed the changes in resource use by subordinate species in plots with different abundances of dominant ants, and in different periods of the day and the year, i.e., at different temperatures. The expected effects of competition by dominant species on foraging of subordinates were only detected for two species in the number of baits occupied per day, and for one species in the number of foragers at pitfall traps. In all three cases, subordinate species were less represented at baits or in traps in plots with a high density of dominants than in plots with a medium or low density of dominants. The number of workers per bait, and the foraging efficiency of subordinate species did not differ in plots differing in dominant abundance. Daily activity rhythms and curves of temperature versus foraging activity of subordinate species were also similar in plots with different abundance of dominant species, indicating no effect of dominants on the foraging times of subordinates. Instead, temperature had a considerable effect on the foraging of subordinate species. A significant relationship was found between maximum daily temperature and several variables related to foraging (the number of foragers at pitfall traps, the number of baits occupied per day, and the number of workers per bait) of a number subordinate species, both in summer and autumn. These results suggest that the foraging of subordinate ant species in open Mediterranean habitats is influenced more by temperature than by competition of dominants, although an effect of dominants on subordinates has been shown in a few cases. In ant communities living in these severe and variable environments, thermal tolerance reduces the importance of competition, and the mutual exclusion usually found between dominant and subordinate species appears to be the result of physiological specialization to different temperature ranges.",,,,,"Cerda, Xim/P-6461-2014; Manzaneda, Antonio/AAG-1776-2019; Retana, Javier/L-1214-2014","Cerda, Xim/0000-0002-3222-2471; Manzaneda Avila, Antonio Jose/0000-0001-9384-7910; Retana, Javier/0000-0002-7505-9467",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,DEC,1998,117,3,,,,,404,412,,10.1007/s004420050674,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050674,,,,,,,,28307920,,,,,WOS:000077666300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gastric evacuation followed an exponential pattern and was influenced by food type; phytoplankton was evacuated at a much faster rate than zooplankton. Estimated gastric evacuation rates ranged between 0.05 and 0.29.h(-1), with mean values of 0.09 and 0.27.h(-1) for fish fed zooplankton and phytoplankton respectively. Despite this large range, no significant relationships were found between gastric evacuation rate and fish size, temperature, food particle size or meal size. Feeding periodicity was size-dependent; small fish had a peak in feeding activity at or around sunset, whereas larger fish appeared to feed continuously. This suggests that fish of different size exhibit different foraging behaviours, possibly reflecting differences in their diets. Estimates of daily ration ranged from 0.99 to 2.52% wet body mass.day(-1) for fish consuming zooplankton and from 2.97 to 7.58% wet body mass.day(-1) for fish consuming phytoplankton.

Studies based mainly on model organisms have tended to focus on responses to average temperatures or short-term heat stress, which overlooks the potential impact of daily fluctuations, including stressful daytime periods and milder night-time periods. Here, we focus on daily maximum temperatures, while holding night-time temperatures constant, to specifically investigate the effects of high temperature on demographic parameters and fitness in the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. We then compared the observed effects of different daily maximum temperatures with predictions from constant temperature-performance expectations. Moderate daily maximum temperatures depressed aphid performance while extreme conditions had dramatic effects, even when mean temperatures were below the critical maximum. Predictions based on daily average temperature underestimated negative effects of temperature on performance by ignoring daily maximum temperature, while predictions based on daytime maximum temperatures overestimated detrimental impacts by ignoring recovery under mild night-time temperatures. Our findings suggest that daily maximum temperature will play an important role in regulating natural population dynamics and should be considered in predictions.

Biochar has been shown to increase, decrease, or have no e ff ect on the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from soil, depending on the specific soil and biochar characteristics. However, the temperature sensitivity of these gas emissions in biochar-amended soils is still poorly investigated. Background and Objectives: A pot experiment was set up to investigate the impact of woodchips biochar on the temperature sensitivity of the main GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions from soil. Materials and Methods: Nine pots (14 L volume) were filled with soil mixed with biochar at two application rates (0.021 kg of biochar /kg of soil and 0.042 kg of biochar /kg of soil) or with soil alone as the control (three pots per treatment). Pots were incubated in a growth chamber and the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O were monitored for two weeks with a cavity ring-down gas analyzer connected to three closed dynamic chambers. The temperature in the chamber increased from 10 ffi C to 30 ffi C during the first week and decreased back to 10 ffi C during the second week, with a daily change of 5 ffi C. Soil water content was kept at 20% (w /w). Results: Biochar application did not significantly a ff ect the temperature sensitivity of CO2 and N2O emissions. However, the sensitivity of CH4 uptake from soil significantly decreased by the application of biochar, reducing the CH4 soil consumption compared to the un-amended soil, especially at high soil temperatures. Basal CO2 respiration at 10 ffi C was significantly higher in the highest biochar application rate compared to the control soil. Conclusions: These results confirmed that the magnitude and direction of the influence of biochar on temperature sensitivity of GHG emissions depend on the specific GHG considered. The biochar tested in this study did not a ff ect soil N2O emission and only marginally a ff ected CO2 emission in a wide range of soil temperatures. However, it showed a negative impact on soil CH4 uptake, particularly at a high temperature, having important implications in a future warmer climate scenario and at higher application rates.",,,,,"Ventura, Maurizio/AAR-8486-2020; Panzacchi, Pietro/AAF-3193-2020","Panzacchi, Pietro/0000-0002-3749-1590; Tonon, Giustino/0000-0002-4851-0662",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1999-4907,,,,JUL,2019,10,7,,,,,,,594,10.3390/f10070594,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10070594,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000482080800064,View Full Record in Web of Science

The amplitude ratio and phase difference between diurnal surface tides and diurnal isotherm fluctuations changed considerably between pronounced internal wave episodes, depending on stratification properties, thus suggesting possible resonant excitation of internal oscillations. On the contrary, no significant diurnal thermocline fluctuations were observed at two other islands (Bisevo and Susac). Theoretical analysis presented here focused on the trapping of long-period internal waves around a circular island corresponding to Lastovo and confirmed that stratification properties during the summer of 2006 around the island were close to resonant ones. The analysis also showed that Bisevo and Susac are too small to support diurnal near-resonant excitation. Application of a numerical model for the current flow around equivalent circular and elliptical islands in the stratified sea provided more details on resonant excitation. Theoretical and numerical modeling results particularly emphasized the importance of island dimensions, stratification properties (pyconocline depth and density defect) and the periodicity of the forcing. Furthermore, idealized numerical simulations demonstrated that the waves trapped at Lastovo behave as the gravest azimuthal mode of internal Kelvin-like waves, revolving in a clockwise direction around the island, and that the eccentricity of the island has almost no effect on the resonant period.

Given the limited data required, such a model could replace the standard approach (ET0 x K-c) for calculating olive water requirements, enhancing the precision of estimates. We developed a specific model of daily gc for unstressed olive canopies that was calibrated by transpiration measurements obtained by water balance from a 2-year experiment in a mature orchard with lambda E-p ranging from 0.6 (February 1993) to 11.5 (July 1994) MJ m(-2) day(-1) and where leaf area index (L) changed from 1.25 to 2.5. The model uses the intercepted fraction of daily PAR and a linear function of average daytime temperature. The model was validated with lambda E-p data collected by eddy covariance in a 3-year experiment conducted in a growing orchard that differed in L and cultivar from the one used in the calibration. The g(c) model, when used in the Penman-Monteith equation, gave very good daily lambda E-p predictions for all seasons during 3 years, ranging from 0.5 (November 1998) to 5.5 (June 2000) MJm(-2) day(-1), indicating that the goals of dealing with the dependence of olive gc on L and of simulating the seasonal variations in gc were achieved. A comparison with the Jarvis gc model, calibrated with 2 months of measured gc hourly data, showed that the gc model developed here performed better than the Jarvis model for the 3-year dataset. The exception to this was the period in which the Jarvis model was calibrated. This indicates that (1) the Jarvis model did not account for the seasonal variations in gc of the olive trees; and (2) the spatial and temporal scale assumptions required in the calibration of gc generate seasonal errors in the simulated bulk daily lambda E-p for this crop. The applicability of this bulk gc model is restricted to well watered olive canopies and to the one-layer approach of calculating lambda E-p but it could be adapted to rain-fed canopies in the future.",,,,,"Testi, Luca/AAO-1826-2020; Fereres, Elias/R-4451-2019; Testi, Luca/H-4626-2015; Villalobos, Francisco J/H-1364-2012","Testi, Luca/0000-0002-8728-7563; Testi, Luca/0000-0002-8728-7563; Villalobos, Francisco J/0000-0002-0990-2970; Orgaz, Francisco/0000-0002-5567-6193",,,,,,,,,,,,,1445-4408,1445-4416,,,,,2007,34,3,,,,,178,188,,10.1071/FP06306,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP06306,,,,,,,,32689344,,,,,WOS:000245086000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because natural PFD is highly variable and daylength changes confound seasonal temperature cycles, it is easier to interpret factorial experiments in controlled laboratory conditions. Clonal Ulva rotundata Blid. (Chlorophyta) has been studied extensively in outdoor culture. In this study it was maintained indoors under square wave photoperiods at five PFDs and three temperatures. Growth rate, photosynthetic light response (P-I) curves, and photosystem II chlorophyll fluorescence properties were measured at the growth temperature following acclimation. Interactions between PFD and growth temperature were strongly indicated in all physiological parameters measured. Greatest PFD response occurred at the highest temperature, and the largest temperature response occurred at the highest PFD. Light-saturated photosynthesis (P(m), dark respiration (R(d)), and light-limited quantum yield (phi(m)) were sufficient to describe acclimation status. The light-saturation parameter (I(k)) was redundant and potentially misleading. Although U. rotundata exhibits a great amplitude of photoacclimation, it apparently has little capacity for temperature acclimation compared to the kelp, Laminaria saccharina,for which published data indicate similar photosynthetic rates over a broad range of growth temperatures. Diurnal variation of P(m) and R(d) at a growth PFD of almost-equal-to 1700 +/- 200 mumol photons.m-2.s-1 was similar to the pattern observed previously in outdoor culture, suggesting endogenous control of these parameters. Quantum yield and the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence (F(v)/F(m)), which were depressed in midday sunlight exceeding almost-equal-to 1500 mumol photons.m-2.s-1, Were relatively invariant through the day in indoor culture, indicating that these parameters are controlled primarily by instantaneous PFD.

We have estimated its mean rate of expansion from 1992 to 2000 to be approximately 33 km year(-1), using data from the annual surveys of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation. We investigated whether or not D. virgifera can establish itself at certain places in Europe, taking its temperature-dependent development into account. We also estimated the time it will take D. virgifera to reach the Netherlands, considering only its dispersal by flight. All life stage transitions of D. virgifera were simulated with the program INSIM to assess whether or not it could establish itself in particular places. In the simulations, we used the available laboratory data on its life history characteristics, as well as a time series (2-6 years) of daily minimum and maximum temperatures from weather stations across Europe. The temperature-dependent net reproduction resulting from the simulations showed that D. virgifera populations cannot establish themselves at latitudes above 55degreesN. The overall expected velocity of D. virgifera's range expansion was computed with van den Bosch et al.'s formula [van den Bosch F, Hengeveld R & Metz JAJ (1992) Analysing the velocity of animal range expansion. Journal of Biogeography 19: 135-150], where the expansion velocity was based on dispersal characteristics and demographic parameters. We predicted that D. virgifera will not reach the Netherlands by flight from the border of its 2000 range before 2018 using this overall expected velocity. The explanation of this late arrival is that the velocity of population expansion decreases in all directions from the centre of its 2000 range due to unfavourable temperatures. Our analysis is an improvement on former analyses in that it uses temperature-dependent life history characteristics. We stress, however, that the lack of knowledge on dispersal behaviour and on the values of life history characteristics in field situations might severely limit the applicability of the predicted velocity.",,,,,,"Hemerik, Lia/0000-0002-6892-2840",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,1570-7458,,,,APR,2004,111,1,,,,,59,69,,10.1111/j.0013-8703.2004.00150.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0013-8703.2004.00150.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000220425900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ninety-six weaned rabbits were used, half from the Botucatu genetic group and half crossbreds (New Zealand White males x Botucatu females). They were assigned to a completely randomized design in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement (two genetic groups and three ambient temperatures) with repeated measures (weeks). Colonic temperature, skin surface temperature, ear surface temperature, and respiratory rate were recorded from 42 to 67 days of age, whereas body weight and feed intake were recorded from 35 to 70 days of age. Average ambient temperature and relative humidity in the environmental chambers were 18.4 degrees C and 63.9% (thermoneutral), 24.4 degrees C and 80.2% (moderate heat stress) and 29.6 degrees C and 75.9% (intense heat stress). Mean colonic temperatures ranged from 39.4 to 39.7 degrees C across treatments. Botucatu rabbits showed higher (P<0.05) skin surface temperature under moderate heat stress than the crossbreds (33.0 +/- 0.1 vs. 32.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C, respectively) and higher (P<0.01) respiratory rates independently of ambient temperature (161.4 +/- 2.8 vs. 148.1 +/- 2.8 breaths/min, respectively) than the crossbreds. Skin surface temperature, ear surface temperature and respiratory rate were positively related to ambient temperature. Under intense heat, average daily gain of Botucatu rabbits was higher (P<0.05) than that of the crossbreds (33.72 +/- 0.90 vs. 30.66 +/- 0.96 g/day, respectively), but there was no difference with thermoneutral or moderate heat conditions. This finding characterizes a genotype x environment interaction. When the age effect was considered, an increase in colonic temperature under intense heat was detected over the last week. Respiratory rate increased in both genetic groups from six to eight weeks of age, but the increase was more pronounced in Botucatu rabbits than in crossbreds, and the difference between groups was consistently amplified over weeks. Intense heat severely depressed average daily gain as age advanced, especially beyond week eight. As expected, feed consumption increased during the experimental period, but the rate was inversely proportional to ambient temperature. Under intense heat stress, feed consumption of Botucatu rabbits was slightly, but consistently, higher than that of the crossbreds as age advanced. Relevant differences in physiological responses and growth performance between rabbit genetic groups under heat stress were detected. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Whether data resulting from constant-temperature experiments accurately predicts temperature effects under more natural fluctuating temperature regimes remains uncertain. To address such possibility, we measured the resting metabolic rates of the South American rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus) under constant and circadian fluctuating thermal regimes in a range of temperatures. Metabolic rates measured at constant 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C did not differ from the rates measured at fluctuating regimes with corresponding mean temperatures. However, the difference between thermal regimes increased with temperature, with the metabolic rate measured at constant 30 degrees C being greater than that measured at the fluctuating thermal regime with corresponding mean temperature. Therefore, our results indicate that thermal regime effects on rattlesnakes' metabolism is dependent on temperature range.

A method is proposed for modelling temperature-compensated rates, based on the coordination of temperature responses of developmental processes. In a data set comprising 41 experiments in the greenhouse, growth chamber, or the field, the temperature responses in the range of 6-36 degrees C for different processes were compared in three species, maize, rice, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Germination, cell division, expansive growth rate, leaf initiation, and phenology showed coordinated temperature responses and followed common laws within each species. The activities of 10 enzymes involved in carbon metabolism exhibited monotonous exponential responses across the whole range 10-40 degrees C. Hence, the temperature dependence of developmental processes is not explained by a simple relationship to central metabolism. Temperature-compensated rates of development were calculated from the equations of response curve, by expressing rates per unit equivalent time at 20 degrees C. This resulted in stable rates when temperatures fluctuated over a large range (for which classical thermal time was inefficient), and in time courses of leaf development which were common to several experiments with different temperature scenarios.",,,,,"Gibon, Yves/B-9919-2011; Stitt, Mark/GVT-1242-2022; Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012","Turc, Olivier/0000-0003-0659-1406; Tardieu, Francois/0000-0002-7287-0094; Gibon, Yves/0000-0001-8161-1089; Stitt, Mark/0000-0002-4900-1763",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,,,,,MAY,2010,61,8,,,,,2057,2069,,10.1093/jxb/erq003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq003,,,,,,,,20194927,,,,,WOS:000277987500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Captive birds fed ad libitum increased their body mass at higher wind speeds and lower temperatures, suggesting regulation of energy stores, whereas free-living birds exhibited patterns suggesting thermoregulatory limits on body mass regulation. Daily energy expenditure in aviary dunlin was 2.85 kJ g d(-1), or 2.8x basal metabolic rate (BMR), with thermostatic costs averaging 59 % of daily expenditure. Slight but significant increases in body mass and energy expenditure in captive birds on rainy days, adjusted for possible external water mass, suggested rainfall as a proximate cue in regulating daily body mass. Body mass changes under artificial rainfall indicated similar results, and field masses suggested that free-living birds have greater body mass on days with measurable rainfall. Increased activity costs under artificial rainfall were associated with an increase in maintenance activities, relative to controls. Whether activity costs increased on days with natural rates of rainfall was unclear. Our results are consistent with current hypotheses regarding the role of body mass regulation in providing insurance against increased starvation risk during deteriorating thermal or foraging conditions, or in reducing the costs of extra mass as conditions improve.",,,,,"Warnock, Nils/AAX-2130-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JAN,2002,205,1,,,,,109,120,,,,,,,,,,,11818417,,,,,WOS:000173536200011,View Full Record in Web of Science

In fed juveniles, final survivals (21.1, 85.9 and 81.1% at 15,18 and 21 degrees C, respectively) and wet body mass (14.7, 51.9 and 106.43 mg at 15, 18 and 21 degrees C, respectively) were significantly different. The dependency of daily weight specific growth rate (G; %day(-1)) on temperature (T; degrees C) was explained by the function: G = -32.905 + 2.8079 T - 0.00166 T-3. Three development scales were compared for temperature-dependency: chronological time (days), day-degrees (D degrees) and effective day degrees (D-eff degrees). It was demonstrated, within a viable temperature range, the suitability of D-eff degrees as a temperature-independent scale to quantify growth in feeding juveniles but not in starving conditions. Seahorse wet weight was modelled as a function of time scales and temperature according to a modification of the Gompertz model. Growth models for single temperatures in the range of 14-26 degrees C were constructed.

Ecological Modelling 183, 183-210.] that was revised, extended and completely re-parameterised for barley (Hordeum vulgare L) with special regard for these factors to facilitate the use of the model in ecophysiological studies and in crop modelling. The analysis is based on novel comprehensive data on photosynthetic CO2 and light response curves measured at two oxygen concentrations and different temperatures on leaves of barley (H. vulgare L.) differing in leaf N and chlorophyll content. Plants were grown in climatic chambers or in the field at different N and T-g. We thoroughly revised the existing and introduced new nitrogen relations for key model parameters that account for a linear increase with leaf N of V-max, J(max), T-p, and R-dmax (maximum rates of carboxylation, electron transport, triose phosphate export, and mitochondrial respiration), a saturation-type increase of phi (quantum yield of electron transport), and a non-linear decrease of theta and m (curvature of the light dependence of electron transport rate, scaling factor of the stomata model). The adaptation of photosynthetic characteristics to T-g was included into the model by linear relations that were observed between T-g and the activation energy Delta H-a of the temperature response characteristics of V-max, J(max), and T-p as well as of the nitrogen dependency of these characteristics. Based on an analysis of diurnal time courses of gas exchange rates it was found necessary including not only the relation between leaf water potential (Psi) and stomatal conductance as used originally in LEAFC3, but additional effects on V-max and J(max) with the above-listed extensions, the model was capable to reproduce the observed plasticity and the recorded diurnal time courses of gas exchange rates fairly well. Thus, we conclude that the new model version can be used under a broad range of conditions, both for ecophysiological studies and as a submodel of crop growth models. The results presented here for barley will facilitate adapting photosynthesis models like LEAFC3-N to other C-3-species as well. The modelling of the effects of drought stress should be further elaborated in future based on more specific experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, B. ramiflora seeds were sown in three plots, one in a nature reserve and two in disturbed holy hill forests, to investigate seed germination and seedling establishment in the field, while laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of high temperature and water stress on germination. It was found that seed germination and seedling establishment in B. ramiflora were clearly reduced in holy hills compared to the nature reserve, although the seeds were only moderately to minimally recalcitrant. This was potentially caused by increased temperature and decreased moisture in holy hills, for laboratory experiments showed that seed germination was greatly inhibited by temperatures a parts per thousand yen35 A degrees C or water potentials a parts per thousand currency sign-0.5 MPa, and depressed by heat treatment at 40 A degrees C when the continuous heating period lasted for 240 h or daily periodic heating exceeded 10 h.

These larvae ultimately need to return to the nearshore environment to settle. One proposed mechanism of transport to the nearshore is the internal tide. The Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus (Cancer) magister, is one species that is hypothesized to be transported by the internal tide. In addition to daily cycles in catch of megalopae being correlated with the internal tide, the annual catch of megalopae is correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. However, intial studies occurred during a positive phase Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In this study, we analyze an additional 12 years of data (16 years total) to determine if the internal tide continues to be correlated with the transport of Dungeness crab megalopae. We used wavelet analyses and cross-Fourier analysis to relate the catch of megalopae to the daily maximum tidal range, wind speed, and sea surface temperature. We found that over 16 years, the correlation with the daily maximum tidal range continues to be the strongest correlate with the daily catch of megalopae. These results continue to suggest megalopae are transported across the continental shelf by the internal tide. Our use of wavelets allowed us to examine the annual trends in periodicity of returning megalopae. We found that the periodicities at tidal frequencies did not persist throughout the settlement season. We hypothesize this indicates cross-shelf transport is primarily regulated by the internal tide but additional, unknown factors, interact with the internal tide affecting the number of returning larvae.

However, neighbouring plants also affect each other in positive ways. Positive facilitative effects can occur when neighbouring plants ameliorate harsh abiotic conditions (temperature, wind and high irradiation). Thus, when environmental conditions are severe, the importance of facilitation may increase. The co-occurrence and masking effects of competition and facilitation among neighbouring plants have made it difficult to tease them apart in the past. We planted bur oak acorns (Quercus macrocarpa) into an experimental diversity gradient in a central MN grassland that provided a gradient in plant biomass. We predicted that greater biomass of neighbours would increase both competition and facilitation as measured by impacts on the minimum leaf water potential reached on any given day. Under moderate conditions, competition should predominate, but under hot/dry conditions, facilitation should become more important. We measured temperature, humidity and soil moisture in these plots for two growing seasons, as well as oak seedling leaf water potential across a range of daily conditions. On cool/humid days, plant interactions were dominated by competition for soil water: leaf water potentials of juvenile oaks were lower in plots with greater herbaceous biomass (and higher diversity). Conversely, on hot/dry days, facilitation of the microclimate determined the net effect of plants on their neighbours: leaf water potentials of juvenile oaks were higher in plots with higher herbaceous diversity and biomass.Synthesis. In terms of plant water status, plant interactions among neighbours can flip from net negative (competition) to net positive (facilitation) depending on daily abiotic conditions.

Another experiment assimilating the in situ profile data excluding the traditional temperature/salinity profiles data but including only the turtle data showed that the turtle measurements captured the warm core rings better than the Oyashio intrusion branches, suggesting possible optimum design of future ocean observing systems composed of different kinds of animals and/or autonomous underwater vehicles.",,,,,"Doi, Takeshi/GLS-9636-2022; Doi, Takeshi/C-1989-2013; Kuwano-Yoshida, Akira/AGR-6960-2022; Kuwano-Yoshida, Akira/Q-5616-2019; Miyazawa, Yasumasa/J-3196-2014","Doi, Takeshi/0000-0002-7342-9145; Kuwano-Yoshida, Akira/0000-0003-3151-8550; Kuwano-Yoshida, Akira/0000-0003-3151-8550; Miyazawa, Yasumasa/0000-0002-0107-6272",,,,,,,,,,,,,1616-7341,1616-7228,,,,FEB,2019,69,2,,,,,267,282,,10.1007/s10236-018-1238-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-018-1238-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000456796200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used a controlled indoor-mesocosm set-up to test the effect of a temperature fluctuation frequency gradient on a natural phytoplankton community. Within a frequency gradient, we allowed the temperature to fluctuate from 18 +/- 3 degrees C at different rates (6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h). The temperature fluctuation frequency gradient was contrasted to a constant temperature treatment with the same mean temperature (18 degrees C). Phytoplankton biomass tended to increase with faster fluctuations but was lowest in the diurnal frequency treatment (24 h). In comparison with constant conditions, diurnal or slower fluctuation frequencies showed lower or comparable performance, whereas faster fluctuations showed higher performance. In addition, minor differences in community structure were observed, but species diversity remained comparable over time. Similarly, resource use efficiency and stoichiometry did not change according to fluctuation frequency treatments. We conclude that the effect of temperature fluctuations on phytoplankton biomass depends on the fluctuation frequency; this suggests that the fluctuation frequency determines how organisms average their environments. However, this trend is not driven by species identity but physiological responses. Our results also indicate that phytoplankton communities may be already well adapted to fluctuating environments and can adjust physiologically to temperature variability.",,,,,"Gerhard, Miriam/AAX-4017-2020; Striebel, Maren/AAF-9996-2019","Striebel, Maren/0000-0003-2061-2154",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,JAN 31,2022,8,,,,,,,,812902,10.3389/fmars.2021.812902,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.812902,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000756568200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The greatest challenge for measuring body temperatures and assessing heat stress in animals on pasture is in collecting the data while minimizing disturbance to the animal. In this study, intravaginal temperature sensors were constructed from blank controlled internal drug release devices and small temperature loggers. Body temperatures of ewe lambs (n = 9) were recorded within a replicate within a week, and these measures were taken sequentially within each of three experimental periods. During the hottest part of the day (1200-1900 h), ewe lambs in the open pasture had hotter vaginal temperatures than lambs in the black walnut (Juglans nigra) silvopastures (P <= 0.0338). Ewe lambs in the honeylocust silvopastures (Gleditsia triacanthos) had cooler body temperatures than lambs in the open pastures at 1500 h (P = 0.0469).

Experiments were conducted to quantify temperature-induced developmental responses of White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) yolk-sac larvae (YSL) reared at temperatures encountered across the species' range (12.5, 14.0, 15.5, and 17.0 degrees C). We quantified effects of temperature on timing of transitions between sequential developmental stages from hatch to initiation of exogenous feeding. Rate of development significantly increased at warmer compared to cooler temperatures; no significant difference was observed between 15.5 and 17.0 degrees C or 12.5 and 14.0 degrees C. When standardized by relative timing of development (RTi), developmental rate was not significantly different among treatments. Morphological traits (total length; body area; yolk-sac area; head area; gill filament area; mouth area; pectoral fin area) were measured daily, though only data for YSL reared at 12.5 and 17.0 degrees C was used to quantify phenotypic variation. Morphological traits (excluding yolk-sac area) were generally larger 48+ hours post hatch for YSL reared at 17. 0 degrees C compared to 12.5 degrees C. In contrast, these same traits, with the exception of gill filament area, were larger in 12.5 degrees C reared YSL when considered as a function of developmental stage. These opposing results suggest trade-offs associated with allocating resources to a particular trait depended on rearing temperature. Our results provide the ability to estimate timing of critical early life stages (i.e., hatch, emergence) as a function of temperature which is an important management tool to understand how early life development contributes to recruitment processes and adaptability in thermally altered systems.",,,,,,"Crossman, James/0000-0002-7134-982X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1909,1573-5133,,,,SEP,2020,103,9,,,,,1149,1162,,10.1007/s10641-020-01007-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-020-01007-1,,AUG 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000555347500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Schutz, W",,,,"Schutz, W",,,Germination responses of temperate Carex-species to diurnally fluctuating temperatures - a comparative study,FLORA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations on the germination of 34 temperate Carex-species were investigated. Experiments were conducted on recently matured seeds at 22 degrees C mean temperature with fluctuation amplitudes of 0 degrees-16 degrees C, and at 22/10 degrees C (15 degrees C mean temperature) in light and darkness before and after a cold-wet stratification. At 22 degrees C mean temperature, seed germination increased in almost all investigated species with increasing temperature amplitudes, in both light and darkness. The average germination percentage across all species was 29.4% in light and 5.1% in darkness. The averaged amplitude required to reach 50% of maximum germination was 9.8 degrees C. Species with little sensitivity to temperature fluctuation in light showed a clear sensitivity in darkness. The germination percentage was 4.0% for species with seed weights >0.9 mg and 23% for species with seed weights <0.9 mg. By means of a principal component analysis the investigated species could be divided into three groups: (1) species with considerable germination at constant temperature, (2) species with a high germination percentage in response to strong fluctuations but no germination at the constant temperature and at low amplitudes and (3) species which did not germinate at all or showed a low degree of germination at high amplitudes in light. The germination percentage of recently matured seeds was generally lower at 22/10 degrees C (15 degrees C mean) than at 28/16 degrees C (22 degrees C mean). Cold-wet stratification enhanced germination at 22/10 degrees C in 33 species in light, and in 26 species strict dark dormancy was relieved. Sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, a need for relatively high temperature fluctuations to trigger germination and reach 50% of maximum germination and prolonged lag-phases of non-stratified seeds were common features of almost all investigated sedges and might favour the built-up of persistent seed banks. The capacity to respond to fluctuating temperatures in particular provides a mechanism favouring spring germination. Sedges occurring in dry or mesic habitats showed a lower sensitivity to alternating temperatures than sedges of wet habitats. In contrast to forest species of other taxa, forest sedges were highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, thereby restricting their germination to vegetation gaps. The variation in response to fluctuating temperatures and stratification in general were relatively small in the investigated Carer species, thus suggesting that their germination behaviour was determined not only by habitat conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0367-2530,1618-0585,,,,JAN,1999,194,1,,,,,21,32,,10.1016/S0367-2530(17)30876-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0367-2530(17)30876-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000078418100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic (similar to 12.5 MJ/kg digestible energy), and contain fat levels of similar to 3.6% and digestible protein levels ranging from 17.99%-28.57%. Feed was fed to excess daily and uneaten food was collected. Temperature significantly affected the specific growth rate of both year classes of abalone. There was no significant effect of dietary protein level on specific growth rate; however, abalone compensated for a reduction of dietary protein by consuming more feed. This observation was evident with significant increases in feed conversion ratios as dietary protein levels decreased for both year classes. With the exception of abalone grown at 14 degrees C, when protein deposition decreased with increasing dietary protein level, protein deposition increased with an increase in dietary protein for both year classes. For 1-y-old abalone, as temperature increased from 14-22 degrees C, the optimum crude dietary protein levels increased from similar to 29% similar to 35%. For 2-y-old abalone, the optimum crude protein level appeared to be less, and increased from 24% at 14 degrees C to 34% at 22 degrees C.

Survival during precold (August to November), cold (December to February) and postcold (March to May) periods were analysed against climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and predictors developed by the model. Host species did not significantly affect final survival, with the exception of slower larval development, and resulting lower cold tolerance, on P cembra than on R mugo at the same site. Across all the sites and hosts, final survival of colonies depended on the number of feeding hours during the cold period (RFT), which explained 82% of the variance in a regression model.

Differences between ambient temperatures and temperatures within nests were noted during the day and night.

There was no significant relationship between intranidal and ambient temperatures during the day (09.00 h to 20.00 h) on all days of measurement (P > 0.01). However, during lower ambient temperatures at night (21.00 h to 08.00 h) intranidal and ambient temperatures were significantly correlated (P < 0.01). These findings indicate that temperatures inside natural nesting colonies of M. beecheii remain relatively stable during the day, but tend to vary at night.

Torpor should be avoided during reproduction because of potential incompatibility with offspring growth. To test if torpor can be used during gestation and lactation to compensate for food shortage, we exposed reproductive female grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), a heterothermic primate, to different levels of food availability. Torpor use was characterised by daily skin temperature profiles, and its energetic outcome was assessed from changes in body mass. Food shortage triggered torpor during the end of the gestation period (n = 1), ranging from shallow in response to 40% food restriction to deep daily torpor in response to 80% restriction. During the early period of lactation, females fed ad libitum(n = 2) or exposed to a 40% restriction (n = 4) remained normothermic; but 80% food restricted females (n = 5) gave priority to energy saving, increasing the frequency and depth of torpor bouts. The use of torpor was insufficient to compensate for 80% energetic shortage during lactation resulting in loss of mass from the mother and delayed growth in the pups. This study provides the first evidence that a heterothermic primate can use torpor to compensate for food shortages even during reproduction. This physiological flexibility likely evolved as a response to climate-driven fluctuations in food availability in Madagascar.",,,,,"Canale, Cindy/I-4323-2012; Henry, Pierre-Yves/G-3139-2013","Henry, Pierre-Yves/0000-0003-2255-7347",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-1042,1432-1904,,,,FEB,2012,99,2,,,,,159,163,,10.1007/s00114-011-0872-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-011-0872-2,,,,,,,,22159593,,,,,WOS:000300682000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Production of stocking material in controlled conditions calls for optimization of the two major factors, temperature and diet. Condition, growth and food conversion ratio in fish fed a formulated diet Aller Futura were compared with those on natural food frozen Chironomidae larvae at 17.21 and 25 degrees C. Groups of 60 early juveniles (0.6-3.7 g) were reared in each of 18 aquaria in which six experimental groups were run in triplicate. Daily food ratios were adjusted according to fish biomass, differences in hydration between the two diets and rearing temperature. No mortality occurred during the experiment. Condition coefficient K was significantly higher in fish fed Aller Futura compared to those fed Chironomidae irrespective of temperature tested; body deformities were not recorded. Relative growth rate at the same temperature was always higher in fish on the formulated diet than in those fed Chironomidae, and food conversion ratio was always suppressed, both suggesting an efficient utilization of Aller Futura for growth in B. barbus early juveniles. On both diets the coefficient K was depressed at 21 degrees C. Relative growth rate (RGR) was accelerated with temperature according the Krogh's normal curve within the range 21-25 degrees C, while at lower temperatures (17-21 degrees C) the observed values of temperature coefficient Q(10), were much higher than the theoretical Q(10) values based on Krogh's normal curve. Food conversion ratios (FCR) were reduced on both diets at 21 and 25 degrees C. Theoretical optimum temperatures for food conversion were 22.0 and 23.6 degrees C.

One precision technology used is a bolus that is inserted into a cows' reticulorumen to monitor reticulorumen temperature. Although it is known that both water temperature and water quantity ingested are associated with changes in reticulorumen temperature, limited quantifiable research exists on the impact and magnitude of controlled water intake on reticulorumen temperature. We conducted an observational study to determine the effect of natural water ingestion on reticulorumen temperature, and performed a modified Latin square where cows were drenched with specific water quantities at specific temperatures to determine the effect of controlled water intake on reticuloruminal temperature. Our results demonstrated that water quantity and water temperature affect not only the magnitude of change in degrees in Celsius, but also how much time is required for reticulorumen temperature to return to baseline. This study provides insights in how to adjust the temperatures measures affected by water intake when using cattle reticulorumen temperature monitoring systems and how to estimate water consumption using decreases in reticulorumen temperature. Abstract Dairy precision technologies helps producers monitor individual animals. Reticulorumen temperature boluses are a way to monitor core body temperature; however, factors such as water intake affects reticulorumen temperature. This research determined the effect of natural water intake and a controlled water drench on reticulorumen temperature (RT) in dairy cattle. In observational study part 1, tie- stall cows (n = 4) with RT transponders were observed for natural water intake (recorded by in line water meters) for 48 h. In experiment part 2, a randomized Latin square design with cows (n = 12) restricted on feed for 4 h, were drenched daily with a water quantity of 6.7 L, 11.4 L or 22.7 L, and at controlled water temperature of 1.7 degrees C, 7.2 degrees C, 15.5 degrees C, or 29.4 degrees C. Descriptively, observational study 1 had (Mean +/- SD 0.27 +/- 0.31 L ingested per drinking event (n = 84) and RT decline from baseline was 2.29 +/- 1.82 degrees C. For the experiment, a 48-h specific rolling baseline temperature range (BTR) was calculated for each cow prior to the experiment to determine time required for RT to reach BTR, and time to return to BTR. In part 2 of the experiment, as water quantity increased, RT had a greater maximum degree drop from baseline. Water temperature and water quantity interaction influenced time required for BTR to reestablish. The coldest water temperature at the highest drench quantity affected time for BTR to reestablish the longest (103 min). Results from this study suggest that an algorithm could be designed to predict water intake events for producers using reticulorumen temperature.",,,,,"Costa, Joao H.

However, the effects of fluctuating environmental conditions on M. separata populations remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated how fluctuating temperatures affect the development, reproduction, flight capacity and energy reserves of both migrant and resident populations of M. separata. Our experiments demonstrated that fluctuating temperatures (20-30 degrees C) significantly accelerated development but inhibited adult reproduction and reduced triglyceride reserves in both migrant and resident populations compared with a constant temperature of 25 degrees C, because the larval period, pupal period, lifetime fecundity, mating frequency, ovarian development and triglyceride content significantly decreased, while the preoviposition period obviously increased. A relative decreased tendency of flight capacity was observed for migrants and residents under fluctuating temperatures. We also confirmed that populations and sexes differed in their responses to temperature variations. Mythimna separata residents showed slower development, weaker flight capacity and lower triglyceride content but greater reproductive performance than the migrants under both fluctuating and constant temperatures. Furthermore, female migrants had greater flight potential and triglyceride levels than those of males at both constant temperature and fluctuating temperatures.

Since many types of building materials are complexly applied in residential buildings in UAE and are constantly using air-conditioning, the result might be different from the characteristics of indoor air pollutants from a small chamber experiment. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the concentration of indoor air pollutants according to changes in temperature and humidity in newly built apartments before moving in. As a methodology, a field measurement was performed in 23 housing units in five different residential towers in Ajman, United Arab Emirates. Before the measurement, a 7-day bake-out was completed, and the target units were measured 30 days before moving in. The result showed that formaldehyde (HCHO) and VOCs such as benzene (C6H6), toluene (C7H8), ethylbenzene (C8H10), xylene (C8H10), and styrene (C8H8) have consistent humidity dependence within the range of 15 %-60% of relative humidity (RH). It was impossible to confirm the temperature dependency since it showed different characteristics for each apartment between 22 degrees C and 33 degrees C. There is a limit to predicting the occurrence of indoor air pollutants in the apartment only with microclimatic factors since there are many other variables, such as various building materials, management history of materials, and construction methods. However, it was proven that there is an emission cut-off point where the generation of indoor air pollutants deviates from a linear relationship in the RH 40%-50% and 25 degrees C.

The energetic response of juvenile gray snapper to temperature and salinity was measured in laboratory experiments to determine the influence of these physicochemical factors on the potential value of different juvenile nurseries. Maximum consumption and growth rates of juvenile (25-50 mm SL) gray snapper were determined in 12-day trials at 20 temperature/salinity combinations representing conditions in juvenile habitats. Ad libitum feeding level of individual fish was measured daily. Maximum weight specific feeding rate increased significantly with temperature and salinity; however, the effect of salinity was much less than that of temperature. Linear growth rate and specific growth rate both increased with temperature, and salinity did not have a significant effect on either. Gross growth efficiency (K-1, growthxconsumption(-1)*100) increased with temperature and was significantly lower at high salinities, indicating increased energetic costs. The higher K-1 at lower salinities has several implications for juvenile gray snapper in low salinity habitats: (1) they would need less food to achieve the same somatic growth as juveniles in high salinity habitats; (2) they would have higher growth at limited ration levels as compared to high salinity habitats; and (3) they would have less impact on prey populations than higher salinity habitats assuming similar gray snapper densities.

We conducted experiments to estimate gastric evacuation (GEVAC) and collected field data from Lake Michigan to estimate index of fullness [(g prey/g fish weight)100%) to determine daily ration for water temperatures ranging 2-5 degrees C, coinciding with the winter and early spring season. Exponential GEVAC rates equaled 0.0115/h for slimy sculpin and 0.0147/h for deepwater sculpin, and did not vary between 2.7 degrees C and 5.1 degrees C for either species or between prey types (Mysis relicta and fish eggs) for slimy sculpin. Index of fullness varied with fish size, and averaged 1.93% and 1.85% for slimy and deepwater sculpins, respectively. Maximum index of fullness was generally higher (except for the smallest sizes) for both species in 2009-2010 than in 1976 despite reductions in a primary prey, Diporeia spp. Predictive daily ration equations were derived as a function of fish dry weight. Estimates of daily consumption ranged from 0.2 to 0.8% of their body weight, which was within the low range of estimates from other species at comparably low water temperatures.

This study evaluated uncertainties of LSTs retrieved by three operational algorithms from Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data. We compared two nonlinear split-window algorithms (SOB and WAN algorithms) and one nonlinear three-band algorithm (YAM algorithm). First, the error characteristics of the retrieved LSTs caused by the input parameter errors were simulated under various land-atmospheric conditions using an atmospheric radiative transfer model. Thereafter, retrieved LSTs from actual AHI data were evaluated using in-situ observations from AsiaFlux and OzFlux networks and the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LSTs. The simulated results showed that the YAM algorithm maintained the highest accuracy, whereas the WAN algorithm had the highest robustness to input errors. The YAM algorithm had the smallest total error including input errors over a wide range of retrieval conditions. Validation of the three algorithms via in-situ LSTs from 12 sites revealed nighttime mean RMSEs for all sites of similar to 1.7 degrees C, and daytime mean RMSEs for semi-arid and humid sites of approximately 3.0 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C, respectively. These are comparable to the accuracies reported for LST products with higher spatial resolutions, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat. Within the Himawari-8 disk, the estimation error of the YAM algorithm was similar to 1.0 degrees C lower than those of the SOB and WAN algorithms in regions with extremely high viewing angle, temperature, and humidity (e.g., northern China, Australia, and Southeast Asia). Furthermore, AHI LSTs showed closer agreement with ECOSTRESS compared to in-situ LSTs, suggesting the usefulness of ECOSTRESS for assessing the diurnal LSTs derived from geostationary satellites.

In this investigation, we inoculated sterile milk with P. fluorescens (similar to 10(3) cfu/mL) and monitored inoculum growth behavior at constant and fluctuating storage temperatures. Three storage temperatures, 4 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 29 degrees C, were selected to simulate proper refrigeration conditions (4 degrees C) and temperature abuse, respectively. To simulate temperature fluctuation, milk held at 4 degrees C was subjected to temperature shifts to 15 degrees C or 29 degrees C for 4 to 6 h. A modified logistic model was used to obtain the best-fit curve for the microbial growth under constant storage temperature. The specific growth rates at 4 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 29 degrees C, obtained from experimental data, were 0.056 +/- 0.00, 0.17 +/- 0.05, and 0.46 +/- 0.02 h(-1), respectively, and the lag time values were 29.5 +/- 4.2, 12.7 +/- 4.4, and 2.8 +/- 0.3 h, respectively. A model predicting bacterial growth under different temperature fluctuations was obtained using the growth parameters extracted from constant temperature experiments. Growth behavior predicted by the fluctuating temperature model and that obtained experimentally were in good agreement. Lag time exhibited a larger variation compared with specific growth rate, suggesting that it depends not only on growth temperature but also on the sample population and temperature gradient. Additionally, experimental data showed that changing the temperature during the lag phase induced an additional lag time before growth; however, no significant lag time was observed under the temperature fluctuation during the exponential phase.

S. aurata (398 +/- 10 g, mean +/- SE) were kept in 3 replicate tanks and subjected to 3 changes in temperature: 16 to 20 degrees C, 20 to 16 degrees C and 16 to 12 degrees C. At each temperature, fish were left to acclimatize for 8 to 10 d, before daily feed intake (DFI), the routine oxygen consumption rate (routine MO2, mg kg(-1) min(-1)) and the LOS were measured. In addition, at 20 degrees C the swimming speed was measured in fish subjected to a decline in O-2 from full air saturation to levels below the LOS (minimum of 8-10% O-2). For the temperature range tested (12-20 degrees C), DFI, MO2 and LOS increased exponentially with temperature (7.5-, 3.6- and 2.2-fold, respectively) with mean (+/- SE) LOS being 17 +/- 1, 21 +/- 0 and 35 +/- 5% O-2 at 12, 16 and 20 degrees C, respectively. A gradual decline in swimming activity was observed as O-2 declined below the LOS, indicating increasing metabolic stress and/or a 'sit-out' coping strategy which may prolong survival time in severe hypoxia.

The major aim of this study is to assess the probable future changes in the minimum and maximum climatology and its long-term trend under different RCPs along with the elevation dependent warming over the IHR. A number of statistical analysis such as changes in mean climatology, long-term spatial trend and probability distribution function are carried out to detect the signals of changes in climate. The study also tries to quantify the uncertainties associated with different model experiments and their ensemble in space, time and for different seasons. The model experiments and their ensemble show prominent cold bias over Himalayas for present climate. However, statistically significant higher warming rate (0.23-0.52 degrees C/decade) for both minimum and maximum air temperature (T-min and T-max) is observed for all the seasons under both RCPs. The rate of warming intensifies with the increase in the radiative forcing under a range of greenhouse gas scenarios starting from RCP4.5 to RCP8.5. In addition to this, a wide range of spatial variability and disagreements in the magnitude of trend between different models describes the uncertainty associated with the model projections and scenarios. The projected rate of increase of Tmin may destabilize the snow formation at the higher altitudes in the northern and western parts of Himalayan region, while rising trend of T-max over southern flank may effectively melt more snow cover. Such combined effect of rising trend of Tmin and Tmax may pose a potential threat to the glacial deposits. The overall trend of Diurnal temperature range (DTR) portrays increasing trend across entire area with highest magnitude under RCP8.5.

Preferred body temperatures do vary seasonally in some species but not in others. Across all species and seasons, the preferred body temperature range was only 4.9 degrees C. The thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of oxygen consumption by pythons conformed to the established range of between 2 and 3. Allometric equations for the pooled python data at each of the experimental temperatures gave an equation exponent of 0.72-0.76, which is similar to previously reported values.

However, increasing annual average temperatures is an oversimplification of long-term climatic change and the importance of climate variance is often neglected. Seven-year moving averages and standard deviations of annually averaged maximum temperatures, minimum temperatures, daily precipitation, and vapor pressure deficits (VPD) in West Virginia, USA were quantified over a 111-year period of record (1906-2016). Maximum temperatures decreased significantly (-5.3%; p < 0.001), minimum temperatures increased significantly (7.7%; p < 0.001), and precipitation increased (2.2%; p = 0.107). Additionally, maximum temperature variance decreased (-17.4%; p = 0.109), minimum temperature variance decreased significantly (-22.6%; p = 0.042), and precipitation variance increased significantly (26.6%; p = 0.004). Results indicate a reduced diurnal temperature range and significant reductions in estimated VPD (10.3%; p < 0.001) that imply increased relative humidity, cloud cover, and soil moisture that may support increasingly abundant mesophytic cool genera species. Feedback mechanisms associated with extensive changes in land use, fire suppression, and browser population may have exacerbated climatic changes.

It is a necessary input for associated models. Most of the current T-a datasets of reanalysis products have limitations at local scales due to their coarse spatial resolutions. For better modeling the radiation balance, energy budget, and water cycle over the Tibetan Plateau, this study proposes a practical method for T-a downscaling based on the digital elevation model. This method is applied to downscale T-a. of the China regional surface meteorological feature dataset (CRSMFD) at 0.1 and the ERA-interim (ERAI) product at 0.125 degrees to 0.01 degrees. The daily mean T-a and the 3-hourly instantaneous T-a. with a 0.01 are obtained. The downscaled T-a. are evaluated from the perspectives of accuracy and image quality, Results show that the daily mean T-a downscaled from the CRSMFD product has a RMSE of 1.13 +/- 1.0 K at 105 meteorological stations and RMSEs of 0.96 K to 2.34 K at three experimental stations; the instantaneous T-a. downscaled from CRSMFD has RMSEs of 1.02 K to 4.0 K at the three experimental stations. T-a. after downscaling has better agreement with the ground measured Ta than before downscaling, especially in mountain areas. By contrast, T-a. downscaled from the ERAI product has unacceptable accuracy due to the great uncertainty of the ERAI T-a. over the Tibetan Plateau.

A critical input parameter for such models is an estimate of the consumption rates and biomasses of prey consumed by fish populations. Here we estimate the annual prey consumption of an abundant coastal piscivore, Arripis trutta, which may exert substantial top-down control on its prey over its broad latitudinal range (28-43 degrees S) in the coastal waters off south-eastern (SE) Australia. Three independent techniques were used to estimate annual prey consumption at two environmentally-relevant temperatures, 15 and 20 degrees C: experimental gastric evacuation experiments (coupled with stomach content analyses); bioenergetics modelling, and; empirical regression modelling. Each technique yielded a similar range of estimates with annual food consumed/biomass (Q/B) ranging from 3.20 to 4.02 at 15 degrees C and 4.23 to 5.25 at 20 degrees C. Using an estimated A. trutta stock biomass in SE Australia of 10,000 t, total mean annual prey consumption was estimated to be 42,200 t, consisting primarily (93%) of small zooplanktivorous teleosts, particularly Australian sardines Sardinops sagax (35%) and scads Trachurus spp. (30%). These results indicate that A. trutta do possess a top-down influence on the pelagic ecosystem of coastal SE Australia via consumption of considerable biomasses of small pelagic fish. However, despite the use of a maximum regional estimate of A. trutta abundance and the presence of at least two other ecologically similar predatory fish species with higher annual prey consumption rates in SE Australian coastal waters, A. trutta may remove only a small proportion (similar to 15%) of the estimated spawning biomasses of its major prey species in this region annually. The multiple-technique approach used in this study has for the first time quantified the diet of A. trutta in SE Australia and provided broad and repeatable estimates of its annual prey consumption for use in ecosystem models designed to manage coastal fisheries resources in this region.

We radio-tagged and monitored 125 individuals of three duck species (mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Eurasian teal A. crecca crecca and northern pintail A. acuta) in three French wetlands over four winters. Home-range sizes for a given species varied greatly among our study sites. Moreover, species differed according to home-range structure and distance traveled to reach their foraging grounds (teal had a more patchy home range and traveled farther distances than mallards). Foraging distances increased with temperature and time (over the winter season), but this effect differed among species, suggesting that they behave differently in response to food depletion and/or cold weather. The commuting behavior (i.e., the decision to leave the roost at night for foraging) differed among species and season. Teals were more risk-prone because they were more likely to leave the roost at night.

While an increasing number of case studies have provided a rich overview on regional analyses, a global assessment on the dominant features of GRACE variability is still lacking. To address this, we survey key features of temporal variability in the GRACE record by decomposing gridded time series of monthly equivalent water height into linear trends, inter-annual, seasonal, and subseasonal (intra-annual) components. We provide an overview of the relative importance and spatial distribution of these components globally. A correlation analysis with precipitation and temperature reveals that both the inter-annual and subseasonal anomalies are tightly related to fluctuations in the atmospheric forcing. As a novelty, we show that for large regions of the world high-frequency anomalies in the monthly GRACE signal, which have been partly interpreted as noise, can be statistically reconstructed from daily precipitation once an adequate averaging filter is applied. This filter integrates the temporally decaying contribution of precipitation to the storage changes in any given month, including earlier precipitation. Finally, we also survey extreme dry anomalies in the GRACE record and relate them to documented drought events.

These two cities have the same climate: temperate and cold alpine but the temperature varies between them. Wire mesh cages were used to determine the relative importance of birds in predation and pitfall traps were used to detect the species and the activity density of invertebrate predators. The results showed that the predation preference of different weed species was significantly different between and within fields. Seed predation fluctuated widely throughout the sampling periods, matching the periodic forage harvest and regrowth cycle of lucerne. Despite the level of seed predation fluctuating, it declined toward the last sampling periods. Using wire mesh exclusion cages showed no significant effect of birds on weed seed predation in both fields. Ants, crickets and carabid beetles were the invertebrate seed predators that were caught in the pitfall traps. There were significant correlations between the mean temperature and predator activity densities and also between the predated seeds and the mean air temperature in both locations.

Nevertheless, as with sensors already used in temperature remote sensing (e.g., Landsat satellites), a radiance atmospheric correction is necessary to estimate land surface temperature. This is because atmospheric conditions at any sUAS flight elevation will have an adverse impact on the image accuracy, derived calculations, and study replicability using the microbolometer technology. This study presents a vicarious calibration methodology (sUAS-specific, time-specific, flight-specific, and sensor-specific) for sUAS temperature imagery traceable back to NIST-standards and current atmospheric correction methods. For this methodology, a three-year data collection campaign with a sUAS called AggieAir, developed at Utah State University, was performed for vineyards near Lodi, California, for flights conducted at different times (early morning, Landsat overpass, and mid-afternoon) and seasonal conditions. From the results of this study, it was found that, despite the spectral response of microbolometer cameras (7.0 to 14.0 m), it was possible to account for the effects of atmospheric and sUAS operational conditions, regardless of time and weather, to acquire accurate surface temperature data. In addition, it was found that the main atmospheric correction parameters (transmissivity and atmospheric radiance) significantly varied over the course of a day. These parameters fluctuated the most in early morning and partially stabilized in Landsat overpass and in mid-afternoon times. In terms of accuracy, estimated atmospheric correction parameters presented adequate statistics (confidence bounds under +/- 0.1 for transmissivity and +/- 1.2 W/m(2)/sr/um for atmospheric radiance, with a range of RMSE below 1.0 W/m(2)/sr/um) for all sUAS flights.

The poor carotenoid development at 13 degrees C also resulted in lower pulp colour quality scores. Eating quality was significantly lower at 13 and 30 degrees C, related to the slow decline in titratable acidity and poor flavour, respectively.

In 2003, the average maximum daily temperature did not exceed 30 A degrees C and the aphid was continuously confirmed on S. altissima during the census period. In other census years, the temperature exceeded 30 A degrees C and the aphid disappeared in summer. At these sites, C. marmorata was continuously found on S. altissima.

Coupled land-atmosphere simulations are then performed using CABLEv2.0.1 within the Australian Community Climate and Earth Systems Simulator (ACCESSv1.3b) with prescribed sea surface temperatures. As in most land surface models, the default stomatal conductance scheme only accounts for differences in model parameters in relation to the photosynthetic pathway but not in relation to plant functional types. The new scheme allows model parameters to vary by plant functional type, based on a global synthesis of observations of stomatal conductance under different climate regimes over a wide range of species. We show that the new scheme reduces the latent heat flux from the land surface over the boreal forests during the Northern Hemisphere summer by 0.5-1.0 mm day(-1). This leads to warmer daily maximum and minimum temperatures by up to 1.0 degrees C and warmer extreme maximum temperatures by up to 1.5 degrees C. These changes generally improve the climate model's climatology of warm extremes and improve existing biases by 10-20 %. The bias in minimum temperatures is however degraded but, overall, this is outweighed by the improvement in maximum temperatures as there is a net improvement in the diurnal temperature range in this region. In other regions such as parts of South and North America where ACCESSv1.3b has known large positive biases in both maximum and minimum temperatures (similar to 5 to 10 degrees C), the new scheme degrades this bias by up to 1 degrees C. We conclude that, although several large biases remain in ACCESSv1.3b for temperature extremes, the improvements in the global climate model over large parts of the boreal forests during the Northern Hemisphere summer which result from the new stomatal scheme, constrained by a global synthesis of experimental data, provide a valuable advance in the longterm development of the ACCESS modelling system.",,,,,"Medlyn, Belinda/O-5038-2019; Lorenz, Ruth/H-5386-2019; Pitman, Andrew J/A-7353-2011; Abramowitz, Gab/P-3969-2019; Wang, Yingping/A-9765-2011; De Kauwe, Martin/AAH-1304-2019; kala, Jatin/G-8408-2011","Medlyn, Belinda/0000-0001-5728-9827; Lorenz, Ruth/0000-0002-3986-1268; Pitman, Andrew J/0000-0003-0604-3274; Abramowitz, Gab/0000-0002-4205-001X; Wang, Yingping/0000-0002-4614-6203; De Kauwe, Martin/0000-0002-3399-9098; Lin, Yan-Shih/0000-0003-3177-5186; kala, Jatin/0000-0001-9338-2965",,,,,,,,,,,,,1991-959X,1991-9603,,,,,2015,8,12,,,,,3877,3889,,10.5194/gmd-8-3877-2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-3877-2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000367243700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are typically described by physiologically structured population models (PSPMs). Therefore, inverse modelling offers a tool to identify parameters of individual physiological processes through population-level data analysis, e. g. the temperature dependence of growth from size-frequency data of a field population. Here, we make use of experiments under laboratory conditions, in mesocosms and field monitoring to determine the temperature dependence of growth and mortality of Gammarus pulex. We found an optimum temperature for growth of approximately 17 degrees C and a related temperature coefficient, Q(10), of 1.5 degrees C-1, irrespective of whether we classically fitted individual growth curves or applied inverse modelling based on PSPMs to laboratory data. From a comparison of underlying data sets we conclude that applying inverse modelling techniques to population-level data results in meaningful response parameters for physiological processes if additional temperature-driven effects, including within-population interaction, can be excluded or determined independently. If this is not the case, parameter estimates describe a cumulative response, e. g. comprising temperature-dependent resource dynamics. Finally, fluctuating temperatures in natural habitats increased the uncertainty in parameter values. Here, PSPM should be applied for virtual monitoring in order to determine a sampling scheme that comprises important dates to reduce parameter uncertainty.",,,,,"Suhling, Frank/AAB-8460-2019; Schneider, Anne-Kathrin/V-4385-2019","Suhling, Frank/0000-0003-2922-0261; Schneider, Anne-Kathrin/0000-0002-1007-0622",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,NOV,2011,214,21,,,,,3678,3687,,10.1242/jeb.061945,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.061945,,,,,,,,21993798,,,,,WOS:000296048000030,View Full Record in Web of Science

A wide range of scaling relationships has been observed globally for extreme daily and hourly precipitation, with evidence of scaling above 6.5% per K for sub-daily extreme precipitation in some regions(2-4). Only high-resolution climate models can simulate this scaling relationship(5). Here we examine the scaling of hourly extreme precipitation intensities in a future climate using experiments with a model for the southern UK with kilometre-scale resolution(6). Our model simulates the present-day scaling relationship at 6.5% per K, in agreement with observations. The simulated overall future increase in extreme precipitation follows the same relationship. However, UK extreme precipitation intensities decline at temperatures above about 22 degrees C-a temperature range that is not well sampled in the present-day integration-as a result of a more frequent occurrence of anticyclonic weather systems. Anticyclones produce more days with strong daytime heating, but are not favourable to the development of deep intense convective storms.

Conclusions: Flies reared at constant benign temperatures were more fecund at all acclimation temperatures.

Using air temperature data from the GDAS forcing dataset as a data source, we proposed a new method for downscaling air temperature based on land surface temperature. In order to evaluate the performance of our methods, bilinear interpolation, spline interpolation were used in the comparison. To assess the performance of the downscaling approaches, the ground measurements were used to compare with the downscaling results.

To explore the potential of subtidal animals to regulate their metabolic processes, we investigated how the oxygen consumption rate (MO2) of the sea urchin Mesocentrotus nudus changes in response to extreme temperature fluctuations by mimicking temperature variations recorded at Dokdo Island, Republic of Korea. We compared the MO2 of urchins before and after a temperature fluctuation. MO2 was positively correlated with temperature. There was no change in the mean MO2 values even after exposure to fluctuating temperature. There was no significant difference in mean MO2 between large and small temperature fluctuations. These results indicate that the metabolic activity of M. nudus might be well-adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations.

Metabolic imbalances, disruptions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress contribute to the increased mortality of chill-injured insects. Interestingly, survival can be significantly increased when chill-susceptible insects are exposed to a daily warm-temperature pulse during chilling. We hypothesize that warm pulses allow for the repair of damage associated with chill injury. Here, we describe transcriptional responses during exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime, relative to constant chilled temperatures, during pupal development in the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, using a combination of RNA-seq and qPCR. Pupae were exposed to either a constant, chilled temperature of 6 degrees C, or 6 degrees C with a daily pulse of 20 degrees C for 7 days. RNA-seq after experimental treatment revealed differential expression of transcripts involved in construction of cell membranes, oxidation-reduction and various metabolic processes. These mechanisms provide support for shared physiological responses to chill injury across taxa. The large number of differentially expressed transcripts observed after 7 days of treatment suggests that the initial divergence in expression profiles between the two treatments occurred upstream of the time point sampled. Additionally, the differential expression profiles observed in this study show little overlap with those differentially expressed during temperature stress in the diapause state of M. rotundata.

The Mediterranean is one of the most sensitive regions in the world to climate change, specifically to changes in the temporal patterns of extreme temperature events, which are of increased intensity. This study focuses on the identification of potential spatial and temporal changes of extreme temperature events in the islands of Eastern Greece and Cyprus. Daily maximum and minimum surface air temperature values are extracted from seven island meteorological stations in Eastern Greece and from three stations in Cyprus. The period under examination extends from 1973 to 2010 and all stations exhibit higher than 97.8% overall data completeness. The assessment is based on a comprehensive set of thirteen extreme climate indices of temperature and on their statistical trends. The selected indices are examined for their annual values and account for the frequency, intensity and duration of the extreme temperature events. Two indices are related with fixed threshold temperature levels (25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and are defined as the number of days when a temperature value falls above a predefined threshold. Ten indices are percentile-based indicators, are site-specific and are associated with the 5th, 10th, 90th and 95th percentiles of the temperature distributions for each station. The duration of extreme temperature events is assessed using an additional index which refers to the maximum duration of consecutive hot days (>30 degrees C) within each year. Upon the calculation of the indices annual values, the resulting time series are analyzed for the presence of a trend using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test under the null hypothesis of no trend against the alternative hypothesis of a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend at the 0.001, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 significance levels. The linear slope is estimated using the Theil-Sen's non-parametric method, which is insensitive to outliers and significantly more accurate than the traditional linear regression method.

We conducted a study to determine whether the variation in the response of seed banks to temperature varied across the latitudinal range of Taxodium distichum swamps in North America. Methods: The soil was collected in a long-term research network and heated experimentally to three current-day spring normal soil temperatures (average maximum daily spring normal soil temperatures during May in Illinois, Arkansas, and Louisiana, USA, respectively: 22 degrees, 25 degrees, and 29 degrees C). A normal is the mean temperature calculated over a 30-yr interval (1971-2000). Seed-bank density and biomass responses were examined in relation to latitude and difference in the soil temperature of the experiment and the spring normal. Key Results: Using first- and second-order regression analysis, we determined that the variation in total germination density was lowest mid-range and in experimental soil temperatures similar to the spring normal. For some dominant species, the variance in germination density was higher in the northern (Cephalanthus occidentalis) or the southern part of the network (Saururus cernuus and Polygonum pensylvanicum). Overall, the variance of total biomass (root, shoot, whole plant) was higher if the experimental soil temperature was warmer than the spring normal.

Precise measurement of hydroperiod features such as inundation timing and duration can help predict community dynamics and ecosystem stability. In areas defined by high spatial and temporal variability, fine-scale temporal variation in inundation timing and duration may drive community structure, but that variation may not be captured using common approaches including remote sensing technology. Here, we provide methods to accurately capture inundation timing by fitting hidden Markov models to measurements of daily temperature SD collected from temperature loggers. We describe a rugged housing design to protect loggers from physical damage and apply our methods to a group of intermittent ponds in southeastern Arizona, showing that initial pond inundation timing is highly variable across a small geographic scale (similar to 50 km(2)). We also compare a 1-logger (pond only) and 2-logger (pond + control) design and show that, although a single logger may be sufficient to capture inundation timing in most cases, a 2-logger design can increase confidence in results. These methods are cost-effective and show promise in capturing variation in intraregional inundation timing for a range of temporary lentic habitats that may have profound effects on aquatic communities, with implications for how these communities may respond to hydroperiod alteration from a changing climate.",,,,,,"Moore, Chloe/0000-0001-6255-199X; Gendreau, Kerry/0000-0001-6058-0893",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,NOV,2021,57,11,,,,,,,e2021WR029958,10.1029/2021WR029958,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR029958,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000723106900060,View Full Record in Web of Science

The concept of the variable fraction of the daily spawning females with spawning markers at a sampling time t (FDSMt), which varies diurnally in relation to the duration of the spawning markers and the spawning time frequency distribution, was introduced. Spawning fraction can be calculated as S = Psm(t) x (1/FDSMt). where Psm(t) is the observed fraction of active females with signs of previous or imminent spawnings, referring to various spawning markers, at a sampling time t. Simulations suggested the following two methods were robust when the spawning time frequency distribution was long and uncertain. The first refers to sampling females evenly throughout the 24h period, whilst the second is based on selecting a single or combination of spawning markers so that the total temperature-adjusted marker duration at sampling sums to around 24h and applying, if necessary, a correction factor. With these methods, the influence of sampling time and spawning time frequency distribution can be ignored. The utility of the second method was evaluated with field data for Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus.

Although climate change may skew sex ratios in species with TSD, few available methods predict sex under natural conditions, fewer still are based on mechanistic hypotheses of development, and field tests of existing methods are rare. We propose a new approach that calculates the probability of masculinization (PM) in natural nests. This approach subsumes the mechanistic hypotheses describing the outcome of TSD, by integrating embryonic development with the temperature-dependent reaction norm for sex determination. Further, we modify a commonly used method of sex ratio estimation, the constant temperature equivalent (CTE), to provide quantitative estimates of sex ratios. We test our new approaches using snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). We experimentally manipulated nests in the field, and found that the PM method is better supported than the modified CTE, explaining 69% of the variation in sex ratios across 27 semi-natural nests. Next, we used the PM method to predict variation in sex ratios across 14 natural nests over 2 years, explaining 67% of the variation. We suggest that the PM approach is effective and broadly applicable to species with TSD, particularly for forecasting how sex ratios may respond to climate change. Interestingly, we also found that the modified CTE explained up to 64% of variation in sex ratios in a Type II TSD species, suggesting that our modifications will be useful for future research.

In particular, exposure to a daily temperature cycle, even within rest shelters, may be important in timing of torpor and arousal and determining resting energy costs in wild animals. We tested how captive bats (Nyctophilus geoffroyi; 7 g) exposed to a diurnal T-a fluctuation (between 13 degrees C and 27 degrees C), similar to natural conditions in their summer tree roosts, adjusted the timing of daily arousals. To distinguish the effects of Ta and passive rewarming from time of the day, we shifted the heating phase to commence at 06:00h, 09: 00h or 12: 00h on each day. Bats entered torpor overnight and aroused the next day at a time corresponding to rising Ta and passive rewarming. The critical T-a (and torpid T-b) for arousal was not fixed, however, but was lower when heating occurred later in the rest phase, providing the first evidence that the critical arousal Ta is affected by time of the day. Bats re-entered torpor in response to cooling late in the afternoon, yet always aroused at lights off. A period of normothermic thermoregulation was therefore closely synchronised with maximum daily T-a, indicating a trade-off between the benefits and energetic costs of normothermia during resting. Our experiment clearly shows that a daily T-a cycle affects the thermoregulatory behaviour and energetics of these small bats. More generally, these results demonstrate the critical influence of behavioural decisions on the daily energy expenditure of small heterothermic mammals.",,,,,"Geiser, Fritz/O-4175-2018","Geiser, Fritz/0000-0001-7621-5049; Koertner, Gerhard/0000-0001-8230-0709; Turbill, Christopher/0000-0001-9810-7102",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,DEC 15,2008,211,24,,,,,3871,3878,,10.1242/jeb.023101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.023101,,,,,,,,19043059,,,,,WOS:000261260500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Determining TSD thermal ecology is important to understanding sex ratio evolution in those species, as TSD systems may pose a challenge to Fisherian models that predict the production of 1:1 sex ratios through frequency-dependent selection. Unfortunately, the relationship between fluctuating temperatures and sex in nature remains poorly understood. Here I present a novel statistical model of TSD in the endangered Amazonian freshwater turtle, Podocnemis expansa. designed to account for heterogeneous daily fluctuations of natural nest temperatures by comparing laboratory and field data on sex ratios, developmental stages, cumulative temperature units (CTUs), and time spent below the survival threshold (28 degreesC). Experiments encompassed constant, shift-once, and shift-twice temperatures in the laboratory, plus depth and shading treatments in the field. A constant temperature of 32.6 degreesC produced 1: 1 males : females, the highest pivotal temperature ever reported for a turtle species. The thermosensitive period for sex determination (TSP) roughly occurs during developmental stages 17-24 as determined from shift experiments. The CTUs during the TSP plus the number of hours below 28 degreesC prior to the TSP significantly explained sex ratio production in the combined laboratory and field data set (positive and negative effects, respectively). However, the relationship for field nests only was not significant. Higher temperatures had a disproportionately larger effect on female production in the combined field and laboratory data set. Depth and shading had drastic effects on nest temperature, embryonic development, and sex ratio. Seasonal climate changes can override the effect of nest depth via differences in oviposition time. Two of the shaded nests experienced the coldest temperatures of all field nests but yielded the highest female proportion, according to a TSDII pattern (when females are produced at low and high temperatures and males are produced at intermediate temperatures). Thus Podocnemis expansa may be a TSDII species, but this intrinsic system seems to be realized as TSDIa in nature (males produced at low temperatures and females produced at high temperatures), because of the general lethality of cold temperatures which precludes the production of low-temperature females.",,,,,,"Valenzuela, Nicole/0000-0003-1148-631X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,NOV,2001,82,11,,,,,3010,3024,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[3010:CSANTE]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[3010:CSANTE]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000172139500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results showed that in spite of the nychthemeral profile presented by the ambient temperature for each season, the body temperature remained in a narrow range, thus indicating a successful thermoregulation. The rhythmometry analysis showed a circadian rhythmicity of ambient temperature and haematochemical parameters with diurnal acrophases. A statistically significant effect of the time of day was shown on all studied haematochemical parameters, except on creatininemia. It was also found that only uremia, cholesterolemia and triglyceridemia followed the seasonal sexual activity of the studied ruminant. This study demonstrated the good physiological adaptation developed by this breed in response to the harsh climatic conditions of its natural environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"Sierra, J",,,,"Sierra, J",,,Nitrogen mineralization and nitrification in a tropical soil: effects of fluctuating temperature conditions,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fluctuations of soil temperature may greatly affect the estimate of N mineralization and nitrification based on mean temperatures, particularly when the daily temperature amplitude is large as in many tropical soils. I investigated the effects of fluctuating temperature on N mineralization and nitrification in an Oxisol, and established a method that takes this effect into account by using current information obtained from experiments carried out at constant temperatures. Soil incubations were made with and without NH4 addition at three constant temperatures (20, 30 and 40 degreesC) and three fluctuating temperature patterns (FTP). The mean temperature of the FTP was 30 degreesC. Two FTP had a large temperature amplitude (8 h at 20 degreesC, 8 h at 30 degreesC, 8 h at 40 degreesC, FTP1, and 12 h at 20 degreesC, 12 h at 40 degreesC, FTP2) and the third was an actual pattern observed at the field with a near-sinusoidal wave and a small amplitude (27.1-33.2 degreesC, FTP3). Nitrogen mineralization obeyed first order kinetics and nitrification was linear against time with an initial period of NH4 immobilization. Nitrogen mineralization was higher for FTP 1 and FTP2 than for FTP3 or constant 30 degreesC. The temperature response of the constant rate of N mineralization was fitted to the Q 10 equation. Calculations performed with the parameters obtained at constant temperature applied to the FTP described the experimental data well. This suggests that the differences between FTP 1, FTP2 and constant 30 degreesC were due to the non-linear response of the constant rate of N mineralization to temperature. In other words, microbial activity at a given temperature was the same under FTP and at constant temperature. Similar results were obtained for nitrification but the differences between FTP and constant 30 degreesC were less. Daily mean temperature was not suitable for estimating daily N mineralization and nitrification when the temperature amplitude was large and I propose a method based on the use of daily mean rates. For a small daily temperature amplitude, the use of the daily mean temperature seems appropriate because it results in only a small bias which is less than the uncertainties associated with the estimate of the rates of soil microbial processes.

Even when the purpose of the study was to investigate effects of temperature, insects have mostly been kept at different but constant temperatures ignoring natural variation in temperature. Here we investigated effects of simple daily temperature fluctuation (22.5/27.5 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C) on some development characteristics in five species of fruit flies (Drosophila) originating from areas with different temperature profiles. We demonstrated how species of the same genus can show substantial differences when developing at fluctuating temperatures not always predictable by development at comparable constant temperature (25 degrees C). Temperature has profound effects on biochemical processes as suggested by the extensive variation in performance of organisms across temperatures. Nonetheless, the use of fluctuating temperature (FT) regimes in laboratory experiments compared to constant temperature (CT) regimes is still mainly applied in studies of model organisms. We investigated how two amplitudes of developmental temperature fluctuation (22.5/27.5 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C, 12/12 h) affected several fitness-related traits in five Drosophila species with markedly different thermal resistance. Egg-to-adult viability did not change much with temperature except in the cold-adapted D. immigrans. Developmental time increased with FT among all species compared to the same mean CT. The impact of FT on wing size was quite diverse among species. Whereas wing size decreased quasi-linearly with CT in all species, there were large qualitative differences with FT. Changes in wing aspect ratio due to FT were large compared to the other traits and presumably a consequence of thermal stress. These results demonstrate that species of the same genus but with different thermal resistance can show substantial differences in responses to fluctuating developmental temperatures not predictable by constant developmental temperatures. Testing multiple traits facilitated the interpretation of responses to FT in a broader context.",,,,,"Pertoldi, Cino/I-1746-2012","Pertoldi, Cino/0000-0002-4644-8981",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2075-4450,,,,OCT,2021,12,10,,,,,,,925,10.3390/insects12100925,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects12100925,,,,,,,,34680694,,,,,WOS:000715253400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examined the variation of surface temperatures of broilers through two dynamic air velocity treatments under hot summer conditions. It was discovered that the surface temperatures varied over age, daytime, and environmental factors (air temperature, relative humidity, and temperature humidity index). A simple linear regression model to predict the surface temperature of heavy broilers was developed. The findings from this study will enhance knowledge to understand the broilers' responses under heat stress, which will be helpful in providing necessary management decisions to create a comfortable thermal environment. Heavy broilers exposed to hot summer conditions experience fluctuations in surface temperatures due to heat stress, which leads to decreased performance. Maintaining a bird's homeostasis depends on several environmental factors (temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity). It is important to understand the responses of birds to environmental factors and the amount of heat loss to the surrounding environment to create thermal comfort for the heavy broilers for improved performances and welfare. This study investigates the variation in surface temperatures of heavy broilers under high and low air velocity treatments. Daytime, age and bird location's effect on the surface temperature variation was also examined. The experiment was carried out in the poultry engineering laboratory of North Carolina State University during summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019 as a part of a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of wind chill application to mitigate heat stress on heavy broilers. This live broiler heat stress experiment was conducted under two dynamic air velocity treatments (high and low) with three chambers per treatment and 44 birds per chamber. Surface temperatures of the birds were recorded periodically through the experimental treatment cycles (flocks, 35-61 d) with infrared thermography in the morning, noon, evening, and nighttime. The overall mean surface temperature of the broilers under two treatments was found to be 35.89 +/- 2.37 degrees C. The variation in surface temperature happened due to air temperature, thermal index, air velocity, bird's age, daytime, and position of birds inside the experimental chambers. The surface temperatures were found lower under high air velocity treatment and higher under low air velocity treatment. During the afternoon time, the broilers' surface temperatures were higher than other times of the day. It was also found that the birds' surface temperature increased with age and temperature humidity indices. Based upon the experimental data of five flocks, a simple linear regression model was developed to predict surface temperature from the birds' age, thermal indices, and air velocity.

The results revealed that: (1) The average soil moisture content of JBM was greater than that of CT by 3.76% and 2.34%, respectively, during the 2013 and 2014 jujube growth periods, and its soil water deficit was minimal in each soil layer from 0 to 70 cm.

J,"Koch, K",,,,"Koch, Kamilla",,,Influence of temperature and photoperiod on embryonic development in the dragonfly Sympetrum striolatum (Odonata: Libellulidae),PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Temperature and photoperiod play major roles in insect ecology. Many insect species have fixed degree-days for embryogenesis, with minimum and maximum temperature thresholds for egg and larval development and hatching. Often, photoperiodic changes trigger the transfer into the next life-cycle stadium. However, it is not known whether this distinct pattern also exist in a species with a high level of phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits. In the present study, eggs of the dragonfly Sympetrum striolatumCharpentier (Odonata: Libellulidae) are reared under different constant and fluctuating temperatures and photoperiodic conditions in several laboratory and field experiments. In general, and as expected, higher temperatures cause faster egg development. However, no general temperature or light-days for eyespot development and hatching are found. The minimum temperature thresholds are distinguished for survival (2 degrees C), embryogenesis (6 degrees C) and larval hatching (above 6 degrees C). Low winter temperatures synchronize hatching. Above 36 degrees C, no eyespots are visible and no larvae hatch. In laboratory experiments, light is neither necessary for eyespot development, nor for hatching. By contrast to the laboratory experiments, the field experiment show that naturally changing temperature and photoperiod play a significant role in the seasonal regulation of embryonic development. The post-eyespot development is more variable and influenced by temperature and photoperiod than the pre-eyespot development. This developmental plasticity at the end of the embryogenesis might be a general pattern in the Libellulidae, helping them to cope with variation in environmental conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6962,1365-3032,,,,MAR,2015,40,1,,,,,90,101,,10.1111/phen.12091,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phen.12091,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000349993900011,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Stelzer, CP",,,,"Stelzer, Claus-Peter",,,Competition between two planktonic rotifer species at different temperatures: an experimental test,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. The effect of temperature on the outcome of resource competition between two planktonic rotifers (Synchaeta pectinata and Brachionus calyciflorus) was investigated in laboratory experiments. In addition to the competition experiments, several physiological variables and their temperature-dependence were characterised, including ingestion rate and starvation tolerance. 2. Because of a lower threshold food level (TFL) for population growth for the food algae Cryptomonas erosa, Synchaeta was predicted to be the superior competitor at low temperatures (12 degrees C). In contrast, Brachionus had a lower TFL at 20 degrees C and was predicted to be competitively superior at this temperature. 3. In both rotifer species, ingestion rates increased with temperature, but the increase was much more pronounced in Brachionus. Ingestion rates of Brachionus at temperatures from 8 to 24 degrees C were always higher than in Synchaeta (up to 4.6-fold). 4. Starvation resistance reduced with temperature in both rotifer species. At all temperatures investigated (12,16 and 20 degrees C) Brachionus could survive starvation for longer than Synchaeta. This difference was strongest at 12 degrees C (5.8 days versus 2.5 days). 5. In the first competition experiment, food was supplied at 48 h-intervals. Brachionus displaced Synchaeta at both experimental temperatures (12 and 20 degrees C). Competitive exclusion of Synchaeta at the lower temperature was probably because of large fluctuations in algal densities that resulted from the long intervals between feeding, a condition that favoured Brachionus because of its higher starvation resistance. 6. In the second competition experiment, one third of the food suspension was renewed every 8 h, resulting in a much better approximation to a continuous resource supply. At 12 degrees C Synchaeta and Brachionus coexisted for more than I month and the densities of both rotifer species were significantly lower in the presence of their competitor. In contrast to expectations, Brachionus was able to persist even when Cryptomonas concentrations fell below its TFL. This was probably because Brachionus was using detritus and associated bacteria as additional food sources, which were present in the cultures during the later phase of the experiment. 7. Autocorrelation analysis of the temporal changes in egg ratios revealed significant periodic cycles in Synchaeta during the second competition experiment. A possible explanation for this is the fecundity schedule of Synchaeta, in which reproduction is highly concentrated in a few age classes. According to demographic theory, such a life cycle feature can cause slower convergence to a stable age distribution.",,,,,"Stelzer, Claus-Peter/F-3789-2018","Stelzer, Claus-Peter/0000-0002-6682-0904",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,DEC,2006,51,12,,,,,2187,2199,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01632.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01632.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000242487400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results from the field observation (2009-2013) also indicated that there was a positive correlation between diel air temperature difference and the ratio of cyanobacteria to total algae. Laboratory experiments suggested that water temperature fluctuation slowed the growth rates of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Cyclotella meneghiniana but not Microcystis aeruginosa, which confirmed our findings of field observation and long-term data analysis.

During commercial production, Phalaenopsis are usually grown at an air temperature >= 28 degrees C to inhibit flower initiation, and a cooler night than day temperature regimen (e.g. 25/20 degrees C day/night) is used to induce flowering. However, the specific effect of day and night temperature on flower initiation has not been well described, and the reported requirement for a diurnal temperature fluctuation to elicit flowering is unclear. Two Phalaenopsis clones were grown in glass greenhouse compartments with constant temperature set points of 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, or 29 degrees C and fluctuating day/night (12 h/12 h) temperatures of 20/14, 23/17, 26/14, 26/20, 29/17, or 29/23 degrees C.

The number of inflorescences per plant and the number of flower buds on the first inflorescence were greatest when the average daily temperature was 14 degrees C or 17 degrees C. These results indicate that a day/night fluctuation in temperature is not required for inflorescence initiation in these two Phalaenopsis clones. Furthermore, the inhibition of flowering when the day temperature was 29 degrees C and the night temperature was 17 degrees C or 23 degrees C suggests that a warm day temperature inhibits flower initiation in Phalaenopsis.",,,,,,"Runkle, Erik/0000-0003-0398-4183",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,DEC,2006,57,15,,,,,4043,4049,,10.1093/jxb/erl176,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl176,,,,,,,,17075080,,,,,WOS:000242716100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

In control group, the same amount of physiological saline was injected instead of the bacterial suspension. Mortality rates and clinical signs were recorded for 14 days. Throughout the experiment, different signs such as eye abnormalities, erratic swimming and body lesions were observed in fish which were exposed to high bacterial doses at 18 degrees C while fish kept at 12 degrees C were completely asymptomatic. No mortality was observed within 2 or 3 days in fish at 12 degrees C while at 18 degrees C, the mortality started growing rapidly even from first day of bacterial injections. Results also revealed that the trend of mortalities in 18 degrees C was quite different from 12 degrees C. The median lethal dose (LD50) on the 14th day was also calculated at 12 and 18 degrees C as 7.22 x 10(7) CFU mL(-1) and 1.711 x 10(7) CFU mL(-1), respectively. Discussion: In this study, the relationship between temperature and infection with Streptococcus agalactiae was pronounced. When the water temperature was 18 degrees C, mortality due to S. agalactiae was higher in rainbow trout than 12 degrees C. It was previously showed that the optimum temperature for growth provide the best performance of fish immune system. Non-specific and specific immune parameters in teleost decrease significantly when the water temperature is lower or higher than normal physiological range of the fish. According to current study, the higher mortality in fish kept at 18 degrees C might be affected by the reduction of rainbow trout immunogenic activity. On the other hand, the effects of water temperature on the progress of infection in fish species are also important. For example, manipulation of temperature and/or salinity can be used to reduce the growth rate of Flavobacterium psychrophilum. The change of virulent S. agalactiae related to water temperature in fish species needs more consideration. In conclusion, there was a clear relationship between temperature and mortality in rainbow trout against Streptococcus agalactiae and the total cumulative mortality at 18 degrees C was higher compared to 12 degrees C for every single concentration used.",,,,,,"Mirvaghefi, Alireza/0000-0002-5954-7997; Sepahi, Ali/0000-0001-7270-024X; Sheikhzadeh, Najmeh/0000-0002-0909-7270; Heidarieh, Marzieh/0000-0003-2097-960X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1678-0345,,,,,JAN 3,2013,41,,,,,,,,1097,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000320936200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Five years later, the MISST project has produced satellite SST data from nine satellites in an identical format with ancillary information and estimates of measurement error. Use of these data in global SST analyses has been improved through research into modeling of the ocean surface skin layer and upper ocean diurnal heaing.

This study has got air flow characteristics in block-stone layer for the first time by high-precision micro wind-speed detector. The results indicate that the convection process is closely related to the temperature change; the rapid cooling is completed in accelerating and stable stage, thereafter slowly cooling process; when the temperature difference in crushed-rock layer is higher than the start temperature difference, the correlation between natural convective velocity and temperature difference is linear. With the cooling process the convective characteristics is different in the same condition of temperature difference. The influence of surface temperature fluctuations on the bottom temperature along the depth direction weakened; and there is a linear correlation between retardancy of temperature and depth. The asymmetry of temperature change is caused by different heat transfer ways and heat transfer efficiencies. At the same time, there is the scope of heat conduction in block-stone layer, in order to ensuring the cooling effect thickness of block-stone layer must be greater than the scope of heat conduction.

Increasing summer temperatures in salmonid growing regions worldwide are presenting new challenges for effective nutrient delivery, particularly as feeds increasingly replace fish oil with cheaper and available energy sources. The effect of temperature and non-protein energy sources on growth performance, nutrient utilisation and digestibility of brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis was evaluated at temperatures reflective of optimum, 15 degrees C, and elevated summer conditions, 19 degrees C. The experiment was a 2 x 4 factorial design with two temperatures (15 degrees C and 19 degrees C) and four iso-nitrogenous (protein: 440 g/kg) and iso-energetic (22 MJ/kg) diets. Diets were formulated with increasing carbohydrate level (180-260 g/kg) balanced by decreasing lipid level (170-130 g/kg). A 12-week study was conducted using triplicate group of brook trout with initial weight 48.0 +/- 3.46 g at each temperature. Fish were fed 2% body weight ration daily. Growth rate was higher and feed utilisation was more efficient at 15 degrees C than 19 degrees C (P=0.00). Reduced fish oil inclusion and increased gelatinised carbohydrate had no effect on growth and feed utilisation at both temperatures. The apparent digestibility coefficients of nutrient and energy were significantly higher at 15 degrees C than 19 degrees C (P=0.00). Dry matter, gross energy and energy from carbohydrate were more digestible as dietary carbohydrate levels increased, at both temperatures. Increasing dietary carbohydrate generated an increase in the intestinal activity of alpha-amylase, which was higher at 15 degrees C. Across the levels of dietary carbohydrate tested; there were no pathological changes to liver or intestine histology. Fish oil can be substituted with gelatinised carbohydrate under challenging high water temperatures in brook trout feeds, with no detriment to health, nutrient digestibility or growth performance.

Body temperatures and physical activity of female mice during lactation,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lactating animals consume greater amounts of food than non-reproductive animals, but energy intake appears to be limited in late lactation. The heat dissipation limit theory suggests that the food intake of lactating mice is limited by the capacity of the mother to dissipate heat. Lactating mice should therefore have high body temperatures (T-b), and changes in energy intake during lactation should be reflected by variation in T-b. To investigate these predictions, 26 mice (Mus musculus) were monitored daily throughout lactation for food intake, body mass, litter size and litter mass. After weaning, 21. days postpartum, maternal food intake and body mass were monitored for another 10. days. Maternal activity and T-b were recorded every minute for 23. h a day using implanted transmitters (vital view). Energy intake increased to a plateau in late lactation (days 13-17). Daily gain in pup mass declined during this same period, suggesting a limit on maternal energy intake. Litter size and litter mass were positively related to maternal energy intake and body mass. Activity levels were constantly low, and mice with the largest increase in energy intake at peak lactation had the lowest activity. T-b rose sharply after parturition and the circadian rhythm became compressed within a small range. T-b during the light period increased considerably (1.1 degrees C higher than in baseline), and lactating mice faced chronic hyperthermia, despite their activity levels in lactation being approximately halved. Average T-b increased in relation to energy intake as lactation progressed, but there was no relationship between litter size or litter mass and the mean T-b at peak lactation. These data are consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory, which suggests performance in late lactation is constrained by the ability to dissipate body heat.",,,,,"Speakman, John R./A-9494-2008","Speakman, John R./0000-0002-2457-1823; Vaanholt, Lobke M./0000-0002-5102-7970",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,OCT,2013,216,19,,,,,3751,3761,,10.1242/jeb.090308,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.090308,,,,,,,,23788704,,,,,WOS:000324233500029,View Full Record in Web of Science

The net CO2 flux was generally near zero during the submerged period with paddy rice cultivation and showed a slight CO2 influx in the daytime and efflux at nighttime, indicating dominance of photosynthetic CO2 uptake and respiratory CO2 release by aquatic weeds and algae in paddy water. The diurnal variations in net CO2 flux and dissolved CO2 concentration had negative correlations with the pH of paddy water. A remarkably high CO2 efflux was observed during the period with intermittent drainage in summer.

This information provides a base for the new management concept of precision livestock farming. From 2003 to 2006, time series of herd mean daily milk yield were collected on 6 experimental research farms in the Netherlands. These time series were analyzed with an adaptive dynamic model following a Bayesian method to quantify the effect of heat stress. The effect of heat stress was quantified in terms of critical temperature above which heat stress occurred, duration of heat stress periods, and resulting loss in milk yield. In addition, dynamic changes in level and trend were monitored, including the estimation of a weekly pattern. Monitoring comprised detection of potential outliers and other deteriorations. The adaptive dynamic model fitted the data well; the root mean squared error of the forecasts ranged from 0.55 to 0.99 kg of milk/d. The percentages of potential outliers and signals for deteriorations ranged from 5.5 to 9.7%. The Bayesian procedure for time series analysis and monitoring provided a useful tool for process control. Online estimates (based on past and present only) and retrospective estimates (determined afterward from all data) of level and trend in daily milk yield showed an almost yearly cycle that was in agreement with the calving pattern: most cows calved in winter and early spring versus summer and autumn. Estimated weekly patterns in terms of weekday effects could be related to specific management actions, such as change of pasture during grazing. For the effect of heat stress, the mean estimated critical temperature above which heat stress was expected was 17.8 +/- 0.56 degrees C. The estimated duration of the heat stress periods was 5.5 +/- 1.03 d, and the estimated loss was 31.4 +/- 12.2 kg of milk/cow per year.

The goal of this study was to investigate the stability of body temperature in large fish using data from field experiments. We measured the muscle temperatures of free-ranging whale sharks (Rhincodon typus), the largest extant fish globally, and investigated their ectothermic physiology and the stability of their body temperature. The muscle temperature changed substantially more slowly than the water temperature fluctuations associated with vertical movements, and the whole-body heat-transfer coefficients (HTCs) of whale sharks estimated using heat-budget models were lower than those of any other fish species measured to date. The heat-budget models also showed that internal heat production does not contribute to changes in muscle temperature. A comparative analysis showed that the HTC at cooling in various fish species including both ectothermic and endothermic species ranging from 10(-4) to 10(3) kg was proportional to body mass(-0.63). This allometry was present regardless of whether the fish were ectothermic or endothermic, and was an extension of the relationship observed in previous studies on small fish. Thus, large fish have the advantage of body temperature stability while moving in environments with large temperature variations. Our results suggest that the large body size of whale sharks aids in preventing a decrease in body temperature during deep excursions to more than 1000 m depths without high metabolic costs of producing heat.",,,,,,"Nakamura, Itsumi/0000-0002-1386-7266",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUN,2020,223,11,,,,,,,jeb210286,10.1242/jeb.210286,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.210286,,,,,,,,34005620,,,,,WOS:000541848100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Changes in tree stem circumference include both irreversible woody stem growth and reversible circumference changes related to water status, yet these fine-scale dynamics are rarely leveraged to understand forest ecophysiology and typically ignored in plot-or stand-scale estimates of tree growth and forest productivity. Here, we deployed automated dendrometer bands on 12-40 trees at four different forested sites-two temperate broadleaf deciduous, one temperate conifer, and one tropical broadleaf semi-deciduous-to understand how tree circumference varies on time scales of hours to months, how these dynamics relate to environmental conditions, and whether the structure of these variations might introduce substantive error into estimates of woody growth. Diurnal stem circumference dynamics measured over the bark commonly-but not consistently-exhibited daytime shrinkage attributable to transpiration-driven changes in stem water storage. The amplitude of this shrinkage was significantly correlated with climatic variables (daily temperature range, vapor pressure deficit, and radiation), sap flow and evapo-transpiration. Diurnal variations were typically <0.5 mm circumference in amplitude and unlikely to be of concern to most studies of tree growth. Over time scales of multiple days, the bands captured circumference increases in response to rain events, likely driven by combinations of increased stem water storage and bark hydration. Particularly at the tropical site, these rain responses could be quite substantial, ranging up to 1.5 mm circumference expansion within 48 hours following a rain event. We conclude that over-bark measurements of stem circumference change sometimes correlate with but have limited potential for directly estimating daily transpiration, but that they can be valuable on time scales of days to weeks for characterizing changes in stem growth and hydration.",,,,,"Chang-Yang, Chia-Hao/I-9273-2019; Lutz, James/AAA-9574-2019; Anderson-Teixeira, Kristina J./U-6075-2019; Herrmann, Valentine/AAY-4643-2021","Chang-Yang, Chia-Hao/0000-0003-3635-4946; Herrmann, Valentine/0000-0002-4519-481X; Lutz, James/0000-0002-2560-0710; Teixeira, Kristina/0000-0001-8461-9713",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,DEC 28,2016,11,12,,,,,,,e0169020,10.1371/journal.pone.0169020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169020,,,,,,,,28030646,,,,,WOS:000391222000100,View Full Record in Web of Science

An understanding of how organisms with different life history strategies will respond to such changes is an integral part of biodiversity conservation. Corticosterone (CORT) levels are often used as metrics to assess the population health of wild vertebrates, despite the fact that the stress response and its effects on organismal function are highly variable. Our understanding of the stress response is primarily derived from studies on endotherms, leading to some contention on the effects of chronic stress across and within taxa. We assessed the behavioral and hormonal responses to experimentally elevated stress hormone levels in a free-ranging, arid-adapted ectotherm, the Southern Pacific rattlesnake (Crotalus helleri). Plasma CORT was significantly elevated in CORT-implanted snakes 15 days after implantation. Implantation with CORT did not affect testosterone (T) levels or defensive behavior. Interestingly, we observed increased defensive behavior in snakes with more stable daily body temperatures and in snakes with higher plasma T during handling (tubing). Regardless of treatment group, those individuals with lower baseline CORT levels and higher body temperatures tended to exhibit greater increases in CORT levels following a standardized stressor. These results suggest that CORT may not mediate physiological and behavioral trait expression in arid-adapted ectotherms such as rattlesnakes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We manipulated autochthonous resources by adding inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus to two lakes during three summers and monitored a third reference lake. Allochthonous resources were measured as fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM). In the reference and two experimental lakes, daily estimates of respiration were made from continuously deployed oxygen sensors. Daily mean values of temperature and FDOM were determined from high-frequency measurements along with daily measures of chlorophyll a, an index of phytoplankton biomass. We analyzed time series of respiration and tested models that used combinations of the independent variables chlorophyll, FDOM, and temperature. The best models included all three of the independent variables. Respiration increased twofold over the temperature range of 14.5-28.6 degrees C. Respiration increased in association with phytoplankton blooms caused by the nutrient additions, but did not track blooms closely, because of large day-to-day variability. Respiration varied positively with FDOM that was primarily allochthonous and differed among lakes and years.

Yet, the role of such variability in determining specific maximum temperature thresholds of cnidarian holobionts (the ecological units comprised of cnidarian hosts and associated microorganisms, including Symbiodiniaceae) remains untested. Here we contrasted the thermal resilience (that is the ability to resist stress) of a model symbiotic cnidarian from the Red Sea (jellyfish of the genus Cassiopea) under stable and diel oscillating temperature conditions that provide night-time reprieves from daily maximum temperatures. Holobionts were subjected to two thermal trajectories; one that increased but plateaued at 2 degrees C below identified bleaching thresholds and another that increased incrementally until holobionts bleached. We used behavior, growth, photochemical efficiency, Symbiodiniaceae (symbiont) cell density, and total chlorophyll cell content to characterize thermal resilience and examined Symbiodiniaceae community composition responses at 1 and 13 days of exposure, and post-bleaching. Lower night-time temperatures, resulting in lower daily mean temperatures, allowed holobionts to withstand daily maximum temperatures close to their bleaching thresholds for two extra days than those under stable maximum temperature conditions. Lower night-time temperatures increased the bleaching threshold of the holobionts, whereby holobionts exposed to night-time thermal reprieves tolerated a more extreme daily mean temperature of 40.6 degrees C and reached a daily thermal maxima 4 degrees C higher than those under stable temperature conditions. However, post-bleaching observations indicate that night-time temperature reprieves did not prevent symbiont cell or pigment loss. Symbiodiniaceae communities were unaffected by lower night-time temperatures and no directional changes indicative of symbiont shuffling/ selection of thermally tolerant lineages were observed. We show that stable experimental treatments may fail to accurately identify maximum thermal thresholds of non-calcifying cnidarians and limit their relevance to in situ environments that are often characterized by high levels of temperature fluctuations.",,,,,"Pitt, Kylie A/N-7421-2014; Duarte Quesada, Carlos Manuel/ABD-6208-2021; Duarte, Carlos M/A-7670-2013; Aranda Lastra, Manuel/D-9530-2011; Klein, Shannon/L-8536-2013","Pitt, Kylie A/0000-0002-2292-2052; Duarte, Carlos M/0000-0002-1213-1361; Aranda Lastra, Manuel/0000-0001-6673-016X; Klein, Shannon/0000-0001-8190-3188",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,JUL 25,2019,6,,,,,,,,453,10.3389/fmars.2019.00453,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00453,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000477076600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Incubating parent birds are adapted to keep their eggs within a temperature range appropriate for embryo development, but king rail clutches are at risk of exceeding lethal temperatures in the latter half of the nesting season. We investigated whether behavioral plasticity during incubation enables parents to maintain clutch temperature within tolerable limits for embryo development. Video revealed that king rail parents interrupted incubation to stand above and shade their eggs. We tested the hypothesis that the onset of shading was a direct response to ambient temperature (adaptive plasticity). We monitored clutch temperature directly by experimentally adding into clutches a model egg embedded with a programmable iButton. We measured ambient temperature at the nest site simultaneously. Parents spent proportionately more time shading and less time incubating their eggs at higher ambient temperatures. Shading may primarily function in cooling the parent. The frequency and duration of shading bouts were significantly greater at higher ambient temperatures. Parents also took more frequent but shorter recesses in hotter conditions. Diurnal recesses exposed eggs to direct sunlight, and the highest clutch temperatures were recorded under these conditions. Complete hatching failure in at least one nest was attributable to high clutch temperature for an extended period. Because mean ambient temperature increases throughout the breeding season, we investigated seasonal patterns in onset of incubation and its effect on hatching rate. Later in the season, parents tended to initiate incubation earlier, and hatching asynchrony increased significantly. Together these results suggest that breeding king rails may be constrained in their ability to cope with sustained high temperatures should seasonal averages continue to rise as predicted.",,,,,"McRae, Susan/L-7273-2019","McRae, Susan/0000-0003-3209-4710",,,,,,,,,,,,,0908-8857,1600-048X,,,,APR,2017,48,4,,,,,479,488,,10.1111/jav.01056,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.01056,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000403146600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Heating the soil under dense canopies resulted in the same germination flux as observed in bare soil. 4 Germination responses to different alternating temperature regimes under controlled conditions were in agreement with the results of field experiments where soil temperature was modified either by shading or heating. 5 These results demonstrate that the alternating temperature requirements for germination of S. halepense seeds have a role in regulating seed germination under leaf canopies.

The emissions of CH4 and N2O and the soil's redox potential (E-h) were measured weekly for two crop cycles. Daily variation in CH4 emission rates was measured with and without rice straw incorporation in planted and unplanted soil (with no warming treatments) during four growth stages of the crop. Methane emissions increased by as much as 91% with increasing amounts of water and soil temperature (+2 and +4 degrees C), up to 34-35 degrees C. Increases in temperature (+2 and +4 degrees C above ambient) above 34-35 degrees C decreased emissions by 30-36%. A decrease in soil E-h to <-100mV and in CH4 emissions was observed earlier in the pots containing rice straw than in those without straw. Methane emissions varied daily; they were larger from 11:00 to 14:00hours, particularly in unplanted soil. They showed positive correlations with the temperatures of both soil and air. In contrast, N2O emissions were negligible throughout the growing season.

The objectives of this research were to (i) identify the stage(s) most sensitive to HT stress during reproductive development, and (ii) determine threshold temperature and duration of HT stress that decrease floret fertility and individual grain weight. Two periods (first at 8-6 days before anthesis and second at 2-0 days before anthesis) during reproductive development were most sensitive to short episodes (2 or 5 days) of HT stress, causing maximum decreases in floret fertility. Short episodes (5 days) of mean daily temperatures >24 degrees C imposed at start of heading quadratically decreased floret fertility, with the values reaching close to 0% around mean daily temperature of 35 degrees C; and floret fertility and individual grain weight decreased linearly with increasing duration (in the range from 2 to 30 days) of HT stress when imposed at start of heading or start of grain filling respectively. HT stress caused morphological abnormalities in pollen, stigma and style. The combination of lower floret fertility (leading to decreased grain numbers) and decreased individual grain weights can cause significant decreases in grain yield.

A laboratory experiment was carried out to investigate this influence in the range of 1-15 degrees C. Samples of sandy soil or a mixture of sandy soil with rye shoots were incubated at 1-5-10-15 degrees C, and samples of sandy soil with rye roots were incubated at 5-10-15 degrees C. Concentrations of N-min (NH4+-N and NO3--N) were measured after 0-1-2-4-7-10 weeks for the sandy soil and the sandy soil:rye shoot mixture, and after 0-2-7-10 weeks for the sandy soil:rye root mixture. At 1 degrees C, 20% of total organic N in the crop material had been mineralised after ten weeks, indicating that mineralisation at low temperatures is not negligible. Maximum mineralisation occurred at 15 degrees C; after ten weeks, it was 39% of total applied organic nitrogen from shoot and 35% from root material. The time course of mineralisation was calculated using an exponential decay function. It was found that the influence of temperature in the range 1-15 degrees C could be described by the Arrhenius equation, stating a linear increase of In(k) with T-1, k being the relative mineralisation rate in day(-1) and T the temperature (degrees C). A simulation model was developed in which decomposition, mineralisation and nitrification were modelled as one step processes, following first order kinetics. The relative decomposition rate was influenced by soil temperature and soil moisture content, and the mineralisation of N was calculated from the decomposition of C, the C to N ratio of the catch crop material and the C to N ratio of the microbial biomass. The model was validated first with the results of the experiment. The model was further validated with the results of an independent field experiment, with temperatures fluctuating between 3 and 20 degrees C.

Few studies have examined whether ectotherms acclimate to diurnal temperature fluctuations, or how natural and domesticated populations differ in their responses to diurnal fluctuations. We examine how diurnally fluctuating temperatures during development affect growth, acclimation, and stress responses for two populations of Manduca sexta: a field population that typically experiences wide variation in mean and fluctuations in temperature, and a laboratory population that has been domesticated in nearly constant temperatures for more than 300 generations. Laboratory experiments showed that diurnal fluctuations throughout larval development reduced pupal mass for the laboratory but not the field population. The differing effects of diurnal fluctuations were greatest at higher mean temperature (30 degrees C): Here diurnal fluctuations reduced pupal mass and increased pupal development time for the laboratory population, but had little effect for the field population. We also evaluated how mean and fluctuations in temperature during early larval development affected growth rate during the final larval instar as a function of test temperature. At an intermediate (25 degrees C) mean temperature, both the laboratory and field population showed a positive acclimation response to diurnal fluctuations, in which subsequent growth rate was significantly higher at most test temperatures. In contrast at higher mean temperature (30 degrees C), diurnal fluctuations significantly reduced subsequent growth rate at most test temperatures for the laboratory population, but not for the field population. These results suggest that during domestication in constant temperatures, the laboratory population has lost the capacity to tolerate or acclimate to high and fluctuating temperatures. Population differences in acclimation capacity in response to temperature fluctuations have not been previously demonstrated, but they may be important for understanding the evolution of reaction norms and performance curves.",,,,,,"Moore, M.

Daily mean water temperatures in the flooded condition were mostly higher than in the drained condition in both locations, and the maximum difference reached 2.6 degrees C.

From the model simulation, the temperature difference between drained and flooded conditions was more apparent under low air temperature and small leaf area index conditions; the maximum difference reached 38 degrees. Most of this difference occurred when the range of water depth was lower than 50 mm.

The effect of temperature on the rate and duration of grain fill was further assessed in two cultivars. Fundulea and Caldwell, over 4 yr.

Duration of grain fill in the 175 entries averaged 28 +/- 0.9 d. Heading occurred on 17 different dates, anthesis on 13 different dates and grain maturity on 17 different dates. The average daily temperature (ADT) during grain fill ranged between 21.2 and 22.5-degrees-C. Comparisons of the ADT through grain fill for Fundulea and Caldwell over 4 yr indicated a 0.83-d reduction in duration for each degree rise in ADT.

Weight of 1000 kernels was significantly higher in plants with early anthesis dates, but yield was not significantly changed by the length treatments.

Dissolved oxygen sensors and pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry were used for the measurements of photosynthetic efficiency. A Diving-PAM revealed that underwater measurements of the effective quantum yield (Phi(PSII)) of both species declined with increasing incident PAR, with minimum Phi(PSII) occurring during noon to early afternoon. Phi(PSII) recovered in the evening, indicating photo-adaptation to excessive PAR. In laboratory experiments, Phi(PSII) also decreased under continuous exposure to 1000 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1); and full recovery occurred after 12 h of dark acclimatization. The net photosynthesis - PAR experiments of S. mcclurei and S. oligocystum conducted at 28 degrees C revealed that the net photosynthetic rate quickly increased at PAR below the saturation irradiance of 361 and 301 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and nearly saturated to maximum net photosynthetic rates of 385 and 292 mu g O-2 g(ww)(-1) min(-1) without photoinhibition, respectively. Gross photosynthesis and dark respiration experiments determined over a range of temperatures (12-40 degrees C), revealed that the maximum gross photosynthetic rates of 201 and 147 mu g O-2 g(ww) (-1) min(-1) occurred at 32.9 and 30.7 degrees C for S. mcclurei and S. oligocystum, respectively. The dark respiration rates increased exponentially over the temperature ranges examined. The estimated maximum value of the maximum quantum yield occurred at 19.3 and 20.0 degrees C and was 0.76 and 0.74, respectively.

Cardamine hirsuta L. (Brassicaceae) shows variation in lateral stamen number, that is, zero to two lateral stamens. The aim of this study was to examine whether temperature conditions alter stamen number. Temporal changes in the frequency of flowers with zero, one, and two lateral stamens were assessed during the flowering periods of a natural population and a garden-transplanted population in Japan. We conducted an experiment to evaluate how temperature regimes during flowering (15 degrees/15 degrees C and 15 degrees/5 degrees C) alter the number of stamens. The proportion of flowers with zero lateral stamens increased in both the natural and the garden-transplanted population as the flowering season progressed. In the growth experiment, lateral stamen numbers fluctuated even within individual inflorescences, but the frequency of flowers with zero lateral stamens was higher in the high-temperature condition than in the low-temperature condition. Temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity is likely to be the cause of the field-observed variation in lateral stamen number for C. hirsuta.

This study evaluated the effects of temperature on development and yield of maize cultivars differing in both adaptation and selection history. Experiments were sown in seven tropical environments where the mean temperature during the growing season varied from 13 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Cultivars adapted to tropical highland, tropical midaltitude, tropical lowland and temperate environments were included. Among these were comparisons of cycles 0 and 6 (C-0, C-6) of three populations, which had been improved through international progeny trials grown at several sites within specific adaptation zones. An additional cultivar, CIMMYT's Large del Dia, was represented as 100 full-sib progenies, and grown in an adjacent trial in each environment. This cultivar was formed by selecting within a broadly-based composite for yield across adaptation zones, and for photoperiod insensitivity. Measures of development included rates of emergence and leaf appearance, and times to anthesis and silking. Final leaf number, grain yield, and yield components were also measured. In two of the three comparisons, C-6 selections significantly outyielded their C-0 equivalents across environments. No differences between C-0 and C-6 were observed in yield stability, as measured by standard deviation of yield across environments, or in developmental patterns. Principal components and cluster analyses revealed that Large del Dia differed from other cultivars in emergence rate, leaf appearance rate, and anthesis date. Across environments its mean grain yield was generally similar to that of the temperate cultivar, and had the smallest standard deviation. The range of grain yields among full-sib progenies of Large del Dia was similar to that observed among cultivars of different adaptation groups. Selection within a broad-based population for adaptation to diverse environments resulted in a cultivar with a unique response of development to temperature, more stable grain yield over a wide range of temperatures, but with less specific adaptation to any single environment. While the temperate maize cultivar also exhibited stable yields across environments, tropical cultivars were more specific in their adaptation. Results indicate that it may not be possible to select a cultivar with high and stable grain yield across temperatures ranging from 13 degrees C to 28 degrees C, because cool- and warm-temperature adaptation may be mutually exclusive traits. Broad adaptation is possible across a more moderate range of temperatures, however and can be improved by selection.

However, the interactive effects of nutrients and temperature on phytoplankton have been analyzed mostly by addressing changes in average temperature, whereas recent evidence suggests an important role of temperature fluctuations. In a laboratory experiment, we grew a natural phytoplankton community under fluctuating and constant temperature regimes across 25 combinations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply. Temperature fluctuations decreased phytoplankton growth rate (r(max)), as predicted by nonlinear averaging along the temperature-growth relationship. r(max) increased with increasing P supply, and a significant temperature x P x N interaction reflected that the shape of the thermal reaction norm depended on nutrients. By contrast, phytoplankton carrying capacity increased with N supply and in fluctuating rather than constant temperature. Higher phytoplankton N:P ratios under constant temperature showed that temperature regimes affected cellular nutrient incorporation. Minor differences in species diversity and composition existed.

Several experimental studies have been performed over different surfaces (pine forest, maize, bare soil) using TIR cameras, either ground based or helicopter borne, designed to evaluate (i) how the spatial resolution operates a smoothing of the temporal fluctuations of the surface temperature measurements from space, and (ii) the resulting uncertainty on these measurements. Additionally, a simulation of instantaneous surface temperatures of a maritime pine stand, performed using a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) airflow model coupled with a canopy model, is presented for comparison. The results confirm that the impact of the SBL turbulence rapidly vanishes when spatial resolution decreases (i.e., pixel size increases) in the range of 50 to 100 m, while T-s fluctuations induced by the low frequency PBL turbulence remain. For these resolutions, the resulting uncertainty on T-s lies within a +/- 1 degrees C interval.

The influence of temperature and acclimation on locomotion performance of the moth was also investigated. Temperature and duration of exposure significantly affected survival of both adults and larvae of P. insulata with more extreme temperatures and/or longer durations proving to be more lethal. Third instar larvae and adults are both freeze intolerant and had LT50 of -5.9 and -4.7 degrees C, respectively, after a 2 h exposure. Although cold acclimation was beneficial to the nocturnal larvae, temperatures below 10 degrees C significantly reduce their locomotion activities. The average daily minimum temperatures in the coldest months at three locations in South Africa are over 5 degrees C lower than those of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, where P. insulata was originally collected. Our results suggest that lethal high or low temperatures at short timescales are trivial in explaining the variable performance of P. insulata, but reduced locomotion at sub-lethal temperatures may be an important driver of the population dynamics of the biocontrol agent (especially in winter months) and may consequently explain the low population levels of the moth because of possible reduced feeding by larvae during night-time low temperatures.",,,,,"Uyi, Osariyekemwen/AAQ-5353-2020; Hill, Martin/G-9423-2017","Uyi, Osariyekemwen/0000-0001-5268-4676; Hill, Martin/0000-0003-0579-5298",,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-4853,1475-2670,,,,AUG,2017,107,4,,,,,448,457,,10.1017/S0007485316001103,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485316001103,,,,,,,,27974070,,,,,WOS:000405628200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

At morning, midday and evening, leaves were submitted to different irradiance levels by differentially shading them. Both species emitted large amounts of monoterpenes (about 20 mu g g DM-1 h(-1)). The most emitted terpene by P. halepensis was Delta(3)-carene followed by beta-myrcene, alpha-pinene and beta-pinene. The most emitted terpene by Q. ilex was limonene followed by a-pinene and P-pinene. No clear correlation to temperature was found for Q. ilex emission within the diurnal range of 21-33 degrees C, whereas P. halepensis emissions increased with the temperature. There was no consistent link between terpene emissions and PFD or photosynthetic rates for P. halepensis but there were significant relationships for Q. ilex. However, emissions by Q. ilex became inhibited at highest PFDs and during the course of the day when net photosynthesis decreased under summer drought. The study shows that the emission rates of both species are highly variable and that during a hot Mediterranean summer day (with limited water availability) the diurnal variation of emission is not only driven by the common light and temperature dependencies. Water stress, branch-to-branch variability and other influences must explain great part of the observed variability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

When microalgae were supplemented with a lipid emulsion, clearance rate was highly stimulated, showing values significantly higher in comparison with either pure microalgae, or a mixed diet of microalgae + carbohydrate. These highest feeding rates can be related with the presence of essential fatty acids in the diet, which are considered as very important compounds during the gametogenesis of invertebrates as well as during the development of ova into normal larvae. Thus A. purpuratus can actively regulate clearance rate and does not simply switch between feeding and non-feeding states. The data also suggest the presence of chemical receptors at the level of the gills and/or labial palps, which seem able to detect specific nutritive compounds present in the diet. Absorption efficiency was independent of temperature and was higher with pure microalgae and with microalgae + lipids. The lowest efficiencies were recorded with the diet supplemented with carbohydrates. The energy expended in oxygen uptake and ammonia excretion was very similar in the different experimental diets and temperatures. Scope for growth in A. purpuratus appears mainly affected by the diet and not by temperature. While the lower SFG seems to be associated with diets composed of pure microalgae and microalgae + carbohydrates, the highest values being found for a diet rich in lipids. The data were in agreement with the reproductive conditioning of A. purpuratus, where the highest percentage of ripe scallops occurred in individuals fed with a diet of microalgae supplemented with lipids at both temperatures. Similarly the highest larval survival rate was obtained from gametes released by scallops conditioned with the diet containing lipids. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, the influence of air vent management and materials' heat storage capacity upon its thermal performance, particularly in the temperature fluctuation and indoor conditions, was discussed. Comparing two days with similar solar radiation (SR) for non-ventilated (NVTW) and ventilated (VTW) Trombe walls, a differential of 43 degrees C between the external surface temperature and the one in the middle of the massive wall was verified for NVTW, while for VTW this value was 27 degrees C, reflecting the heat transfer by air convection, which reduced greenhouse effect, solar absorption and heat storage. A cooling capacity greater than 50% was verified for VTW compared to NVTW during night periods. An algorithm for the Trombe wall's automation and control was proposed considering SR as variable. Air vents and external shading devices should be open when SR exceeds 100 W/m(2) and closed for 50 W/m(2) to obtain at least 20 degrees C inside the room.

Experiments were conducted on two-year-old seedlings in growth chambers using different combinations of day and night-time temperatures. The first experiment exposed trees to 22/22, 29/22, 22/15, and 29/15 degreesC day/night (d/n). When measured at a common temperature (15, 22 or 29 degreesC), respiration rates were lower for trees exposed to higher treatment temperatures and acclimation was influenced by both day and night-time temperature. However, the extent of acclimation did not relate to mean temperature, i.e. respiration rates measured at a common temperature ranked as follows for seedlings exposed to different temperature regimes, 22/15 > 22/22 > 29/15 congruent to 29/22 degreesC d/n. Rather, acclimation of foliar respiration was linearly related to mean daily respiration rate, where mean daily respiration rate is the average of the respiration rates measured at the day and night-time treatment temperatures. The discrepancy between mean daily respiration rate and mean daily temperature occurred because respiration increased exponentially with increasing temperature. In a second experiment, the same seedlings were exposed to 22/22, 15/15, 25.5/18.5, and 25.5/15 degreesC d/n to test the relationship between mean daily respiration rate and acclimation. As in the first experiment, acclimation was linearly related to mean daily respiration rate. The concept of effective acclimation temperature, which is the temperature at which the mean daily respiration rate occurs, was derived from these results as a means to predict the extent that foliar respiration acclimates to treatment temperature.",,,,,"Will, Rodney/G-8111-2011","Will, Rodney/0000-0002-4649-8858",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,,,,,OCT,2000,51,351,,,,,1733,1739,,10.1093/jexbot/51.351.1733,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jexbot/51.351.1733,,,,,,,,11053463,,,,,WOS:000165205400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

In eight replicates, estrus was synchronized in mature gilts (n = 198) and after last feeding of Matrix were randomly assigned to a room temperature of 15 degrees C (COLD), 21 degrees C (NEUTRAL), or 30 degrees C (HOT) and a light intensity of 11 (DIM) or 433 (BRIGHT) lx. Estrous detection was performed daily and gilts inseminated twice. Blood samples were collected before and after breeding for determination of immune measures and cortisol concentrations. Gilt ADFI, BW, and body temperature were measured. On d 30 postbreeding, gilts were slaughtered to recover reproductive tracts to evaluate pregnancy and litter characteristics. There were no temperature x light intensity interactions for any response variable. Reproductive measures of follicle development, expression of estrus, ovulation rate, pregnancy rate (83.2%), litter size (14.3 +/- 0.5), and fetal measures were not affected by temperature or lighting (P > 0.10). Gilts in COLD (37.6 degrees C) had a lower (P < 0.05) rectal temperature than those in NEUTRAL (38.2 degrees C) and HOT (38.6 +/- 0.04 degrees C). Both BW gain and final BW were greater (P < 0.0001) for gilts kept in HOT than those in NEUTRAL or COLD environments. Cortisol was greater (P < 0.01) for gilts kept in COLD compared with those kept in the HOT room. Gilts housed in the HOT environment made more postural changes (P < 0.05) than did those kept in either COLD or NEUTRAL temperatures. Gilts kept in the HOT temperature spent more total time lying and more time lying ventrally compared with those gilts housed in the NEUTRAL or COLD rooms. Total white blood cells and the percentage of neutrophils as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were all influenced (P < 0.05) by temperature but there was no effect (P > 0.10) of light or interaction with temperature on other immune cells or measures. These results indicate that temperatures in the range of 15 to 30 degrees C or light intensity at 11 to 433 lx do not impact reproduction during the follicular phase and into early gestation for mature gilts housed in gestation crates. However, room temperature does impact physiological, behavioral, and immune responses of mature gilts and should be considered as a potential factor that may influence gilt well-being during the first 30 d postbreeding.

Piecewise-linear (broken-stick) functions have been suggested to model this relationship. The aim of this paper was to assess how previously suggested triangular-shaped (TS) and plateau-shaped (PS) models performed for seven common Mediterranean crops: pea (Pisum sativum L.), lupine (Lupinus luteus L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), broad bean (Vicia faba L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare L.). Experiments were performed using a thermogradient plate, with temperatures monitored by Cu-CuNi thermocouples. Five temperature ranges, suitable to the thermal responses of each crop, were used. The TS and PS models were fitted to the resulting time to germination vs. mean temperature datasets. The choice of temperature ranges (sub-and supraoptimal in both the TS and the PS models, and an additional intermediate optimal range in the PS model) considered all possible partitions of the data points. The partition that provided the best fit was chosen. The germination rate-temperature relationship was well described by both models. The choice of model affected estimates of cardinal temperatures, thermal times, and maximum rates of germination. Differences were especially noticeable for the heavierseed crops (broad bean, chickpea, and corn), encouraging the widespread use of the PS model to simulate these relationships.

Passive greenhouse apparatus is commonly used to investigate the in situ biological response of terrestrial communities to global warming. 2. Although close conformity of greenhouse treatment effects to general circulation model (GCM) scenarios is widely claimed, no proof of such a relationship has yet been published. 3. Here, the relationship between passive greenhouse thermal environment and future climate conditions is considered using temperature data collected from within and without greenhouses deployed in the maritime Antarctic. It is revealed that in terms of thermal extremes, diel and annual variation, and overall distribution across the temperature spectrum, such apparatus achieves only poor simulation of GCM forecasts. 4. During summer, greenhouses induce an amplified daily range of temperatures, elevated maxima and accelerated rates of change. 5. During spring and autumn, diel temperature variation continues inside the greenhouses while snow cover protects the controls. 6. During winter, an inverse treatment effect occurs, in which the relative depth of snow cover causes lower temperatures in greenhouses than in controls. 7. These treatment effects differ significantly from GCM climate predictions. Changes recorded in the composition, structure and function of greenhouse biota may thus be artefacts of the methodology. 8. Thorough a priori testing of greenhouse treatment effects is recommended for future climate change studies that are to be conducted in environments subject to seasonal snowfall, solar elevation and day length.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,APR,1995,9,2,,,,,340,350,,10.2307/2390583,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2390583,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QU91300026,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seed-propagated Antirrhinum, Calendula, Diascia, Gerbera, Gomphrena, Heliotropium, Impatiens, Matthiola, Nemesia, Nicotiana, Nierembergia, Osteospermum, Pelargonium, Petunia, Tagetes, and Torenia were grown in five greenhouse compartments maintained at constant temperature set points of 14, 17, 20, 23 or 26 degrees C. The 16-h photoperiod consisted of the natural photoperiod with supplemental high-pressure sodium lighting from 0600 to 2200 h. The mean photosynthetic daily light integral during the two replications of this experiment varied from 9 to 18 mol m(-2) d(-1). Days to flower from transplant and number of nodes at flowering were measured on each plant. As MDT increased from 14 to 26 degrees C, days to flower decreased for all crops except Impatiens walleriana. Linear or nonlinear regression analysis was performed on the flowering rate (reciprocal of days to flower) data to estimate the base temperature (T-min) for each species, which is the temperature at which the flowering rate is zero. T-min ranged from -3.9 degrees C for Diascia barberae to 13.8 degrees C for Gomphrena globosa, which illustrates the crop-specific nature of developmental rates to temperature. The effect of MDT on node number before flowering varied among species, with four, four, and eight species showing an increase, a decrease, or no difference in node number at flowering as MDT increased. There was no apparent relationship between the estimated T-mm values and the cold hardiness of species, which indicates that cold hardiness cannot be used to reliably predict developmental rates at low temperatures or vice versa.

Selected according to a rotatable central composite design, these treatment combinations represent commercial greenhouse conditions during the winter and spring in the midwestern United States; each selected condition was maintained in an environmental growth chamber having 12-hour photoperiods. ROSESIM incorporates regression models of four flower development characteristics (days from pinch to visible bud, first color, sepal reflex, and flowering) that are full quadratic polynomials in PPF, DT, and NT. ROSESIM also incorporates mathematical models of nine plant growth characteristics (stem length and the following fresh and dry weights: stem, leaf, flower, and total) based on data recorded every 10 days and at flowering. At each design point, a cubic regression in time (days from pinch) estimated the plant growth characteristics on intermediate days; then difference equations were developed to predict the resulting daily growth increments as third-degree polynomial functions of days from pinch, PPF, DT, and NT. ROSESIM was verified by plotting against time each simulated plant growth characteristic and the associated experimental observations for the eight factorial design points defining the region of interest. Moreover, one-way analysis of variance procedures were applied to the differences between ROSESIM predictions and the corresponding observed means for all 15 treatment combinations. At 20 days from pinch, significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed for all nine plant growth characteristics. At 30 and 40 days from pinch, only flower fresh and dry weights yielded significant differences; at flowering, none of the 13 selected responses yielded significant differences. These graphical and statistical comparisons provide good evidence of ROSESIM's ability to predict the growth response of 'Royalty' roses over a wide range of constant environmental conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1062,,,,,SEP,1994,119,5,,,,,903,914,,10.21273/JASHS.119.5.903,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS.119.5.903,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PC95100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Note that outdoor weather patterns are somewhat repetitive in nature and historical records of outdoor temperature are readily accessible; we present a data-driven iterative learning approach to improve the room temperature tracking performance over time. By comparing the short-term temperature forecast with the past data, chains of (nonconsecutive) days exhibiting similar outside temperature patterns can be identified. The corresponding building operation record (heat input and temperature output trajectories) may then be used in the iterative learning control (ILC) to update the input based on the past temperature tracking error. Multizone buildings are strictly passive from the heat input to temperature output in all zones. This property assures the convergence of the ILC iteration if the update gain is suitably bounded, without the need of an accurate model. This means that for each chain, the zone temperature deviation from the specified profile will converge to zero as the number of days in the chain grows (i.e., as more iterations of ILC are performed). Using a six-zone physical test bed with programmable ambient temperatures, we demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approach in multiple experimental trials. Additional longer-duration simulations are performed based on the actual temperature recorded in Orlando, FL, USA and New York, NY, USA over a two-year period. In all cases, ILC is shown to improve the tracking error in the presence of ambient temperature fluctuations. Note to Practitioners-This paper uses historic operating data and weather forecasting to improve the temperature tracking in multizone buildings. The proposed approach exploits the inherent passivity property of the building thermal model and, therefore, does not require the accurate model identification prior to implementation. As a result, this method may be conveniently retrofitted to any existing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, provided that the system is capable of adjusting the heat input (e.g., by controlling the supply air flow rate) and storing temperature sensor data. The algorithm uses weather prediction to match the upcoming ambient temperature variation with those experienced in the past. With the past operating data (control input and resulting temperature error) from the matched day, a feed-forward control is iteratively updated to improve the tracking performance. This paper includes the experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in our test bed, and simulation examples to provide the insight into the real-world implementation.

This study investigated the effect of temperature reductions on Montastraea cavemosa and Ponies astreoides in Bermuda (32 degrees N; sea surface temperature similar to 19-29 degrees C) over 5 weeks, applying the following treatments: (i) constant control temperature at 28 degrees C, and (ii) temperature reduction (0.5 degrees C day(-1)) followed by constant temperature (20 days; acclimatization period) at 24 degrees C and (iii) at 20 degrees C. Both species decreased photosynthesis and respiration during temperature reduction as expected, which continued to decrease during the acclimatization period, indicating adjustment to a low energy turnover rather than thermal compensation. Trajectories of physiological adjustments and level of thermal compensation, however, differed between species. Montastraea cavemosa zooxanthellae metrics showed a strong initial response to temperature reduction, followed by a return to close to control values during the acclimatization period, reflecting a high physiological flexibility and low thermal compensation. Ponies astreoides zooxanthellae, in contrast, showed no initial response, but an increase in pigment concentration per zooxanthellae and similar photosynthesis rates at 24 degrees C and 20 degrees C at the end of the experiment, indicating low acute thermal sensitivity and the ability for thermal compensation at the lowest temperature. Respiration decreased more strongly than photosynthesis, leading to significant build-up of biomass in both species (energy reserves).

Annual stream temperature dynamics are useful in classifying fundamental thermal regimes and can enhance process-based interpretation of stream temperature controls, including deep and shallow groundwater discharge, when paired with air signals. In this study, we investigated mull-scale variability in annual paired air-water temperature patterns using sine-wave linear regressions of mull-year daily temperature data from streams of various sizes. A total of 311 sites from two spatially intensive regional datasets (Shenandoah National Park and Olympic Experimental State Forest) and a spatially extensive national dataset spanning the contiguous United States (U.S. Geological Survey gages) were evaluated. We calculated three annual air-water thermal metrics (mean ratio, phase lag, and amplitude ratio) to deduce the influence of groundwater and other watershed processes on stream thermal regimes at multiple spatial scales. Site-specific values of the three annual air-water thermal metrics ranged from 0.69 to 5.29 (mean ratio), -9 to 40 days (phase lag), and 0.29 to 1.12 (amplitude ratio). Regional patterns in the annual thermal metrics revealed persistent yet spatially variable influences of shallow groundwater discharge and high levels of thermal variability within watersheds, indicating the importance of local hydrogeological controls on stream temperature. Furthermore, annual thermal metric patterns from the regional datasets were generally concordant with the national dataset suggesting the utility of these annual thermal metrics for analysis at multiple scales. Analysis of the national dataset showed that previously defined thermal regimes based on water temperature alone could be further refined using air-water metrics and these metrics were related to physiographic watershed characteristics such as contributing area, elevation, and slope. This research demonstrates the importance of spatial scale and heterogeneity for inferring hydrological process in streams and provides guidance for the interpretation of annual air-water temperature metrics that can be efficiently applied to the growing database of multi-year temperature records. Results from this research can aid in the prediction of future thermal habitat suitability for coldwater-adapted species at ecologically and management-relevant spatial scales with readily available data.",,,,,,"Johnson, Zachary/0000-0002-0149-5223",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1694,1879-2707,,,,AUG,2020,587,,,,,,,,124929,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124929,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124929,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000568819100067,View Full Record in Web of Science

This discrepancy could have been associated with naturally occurring gradients in temperature that reduced the difference in temperature between the probes, which would have caused the sensor method to underestimate water use. Our results indicate that substitution of variable length heat dissipation probes for probes of the original Granier design did not invalidate the empirical relationship determined by Granier between sap flux density and the temperature difference between probes.",,,,,"Meinzer, Frederick/N-8373-2019; Meinzer, Frederick C/C-3496-2012","Meinzer, Frederick/0000-0003-2387-2031; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,SEP,2007,27,9,,,,,1355,1360,,10.1093/treephys/27.9.1355,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/27.9.1355,,,,,,,,17545135,,,,,WOS:000249679000014,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we measured energy metabolism and water turnover in free-ranging grey mouse lemurs Microcebus murinus (approximately 60 g) using doubly labelled water during the austral winter in the rain forest of southeastern Madagascar. We then compared patterns of thermal biology between grey mouse lemurs from the rain forest and a population from the dry forest. M. murinus from the rain forest, without a distinct dry season, entered daily torpor independent of ambient temperature (T (a)). There were no differences in torpor occurrence, duration and depth between M. murinus from the rain and dry forest. Mouse lemurs using daily torpor reduced their energy expenditure by 11% in the rain forest and by 10.5% in the dry forest, respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean water flux rates of mouse lemurs remaining normothermic between populations of both sites. In contrast, mean water flux rate of individuals from the dry forest that used torpor was significantly lower than those from the rain forest. This study represents the first account of energy expenditure, water flux and skin temperature (T (sk)) in free-ranging M. murinus from the rain forest. Our comparative findings suggest that water turnover and therefore water requirement during the austral winter months plays a more restricting role on grey mouse lemurs from the dry forest than on those from the rain forest.",,,,,"Speakman, John R./A-9494-2008","Speakman, John R./0000-0002-2457-1823",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-1042,1432-1904,,,,MAY,2009,96,5,,,,,609,620,,10.1007/s00114-009-0515-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0515-z,,,,,,,,19229507,,,,,WOS:000264994600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

SOYBEAN (GLYCINE-MAX),EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eleven genotypes of soyabean (Glycine max) of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate origin and one accession of G. soja were grown in six locations in Australia during 1986-88, and at one location in Australia and two in Taiwan during 1989-91. Dates of sowing were varied within and among locations so as to expose plants to as many as 32 environments of widely different diurnal temperature and daylength. Times from sowing to flowering (f) were recorded, from which rates of progress towards flowering (1/f) were calculated. These derived data were then related to mean pre-flowering values of temperature (TBAR) and photoperiod (P) using a three-plane linear model developed from controlled environment data. Among genotypes, mean values off varied between 24-49 d and between 134-291 d in the most- and least-inductive environments, respectively. These differences were associated with variations in P from about 11 to 16 h d-1, in daily mean maximum temperatures from about 17-degrees to 36-degrees-C, in daily mean minimum temperatures from about 5-degrees to 25-degrees-C, and in TBAR from about 11-degrees to 30-degrees-C, that is, a very wide range of photothermal regimes. The relations of 1/f to TBAR and P can be described in photoperiod-insensitive genotypes by a thermal plane defined by two constants, a and b, and additionally by a photothermal plane defined by three constants, a', b' and c', in the more numerous photoperiod-sensitive genotypes. If photoperiod-sensitive genotypes are grown in sufficiently long days then a third photoperiod and temperature-insensitive plane is exposed, defined by a constant, d'; this plane indicates the maximum delay in flowering of which the genotype is capable. The constants a', b', c' and d' define the delay in flowering caused by photoperiod-sensitivity genes. The two intercepts between the three planes define, respectively, the critical photoperiod, P(c), above which increase in daylength delays flowering, and the ceiling photoperiod, P(ce), above which there is no further delay. The values of the six constants for any genotype can be estimated from observations of fin several natural environments. Comparisons between years in Australia and between Australia and Taiwan show that these genotypic constants can predict 1/f, and so the time taken to flower, given data on latitude, sowing date and daily values of maximum and minimum air temperatures. This model is more accurate than an alternative logistic model; we also believe that all six constants in the three-plane rate model described here have biological meaning. They indicate separate genetic control of flowering responses to P and TBAR and could form a rational basis for the genetic characterization and analysis of these responses in the soyabean germplasm.",,,,,"Qi, Aiming/AAH-7872-2021; Lawn, Robert J/E-8528-2011","Qi, Aiming/0000-0002-0784-9520; Lawn, Robert J/0000-0001-7820-4650; Ellis, Richard/0000-0002-3695-6894",,,,,,,,,,,,,0014-4797,,,,,JUL,1993,29,3,,,,,253,289,,10.1017/S0014479700020858,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0014479700020858,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LP08700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we study the DEE of the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), which is declining in the UK. We hypothesise that there is a gradient of suitable habitat for hedgehogs in rural areas, which is a result of fewer food resources, a higher risk from predation by badgers (Meles meles) and colder ambient temperatures, as distance to the nearest building increases. We used the doubly labelled water method to obtain 44 measurements of DEE from hedgehogs on four predominately arable sites, to determine the energetic costs associated with proximity to buildings, on sites with and without badgers. The mean +/- s.e.m. DEE was 508.9 +/- 34.8 kJ day(-1). DEE increased the further a hedgehog was from buildings during the study, possibly as they ranged larger distances on arable land, supporting the hypothesis that hedgehogs select villages owing to the lower energy demands in comparison to arable farmland. Hedgehogs had an approximately 30% lower DEE on sites with badgers. We speculate that on badger-occupied sites, hedgehogs may restrict movement and foraging in response to a threat from predation and thus have reduced DEE. Therefore, hedgehogs may also seek refuge in villages where the perceived threat of predation is lower and foraging is unrestricted. In a broader context, we demonstrate that individual differences in DEE can aid in understanding habitat selection in a patchily distributed species.",,,,,,"Pettett, Carly/0000-0002-4390-0696",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,FEB 1,2017,220,3,,,,,460,468,,10.1242/jeb.150359,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.150359,,,,,,,,28148819,,,,,WOS:000394100300023,View Full Record in Web of Science

This rich time series data allowed us to model how plants integrate temperature and light signals to determine how much to grow, using techniques from functional data analysis. We determined that under nutrient-poor hydroponic conditions, growth of spring onion is sensitive to even a few degrees change in temperature, and is most correlated with warm nighttime temperatures, high temperatures at the start of the experiment, and light exposure near the end of the experiment.

Previous authors proposed that differences in temperature, light quantity, and the lack of their variation are sources of deviations between indoor and outdoor experiments. Here, we investigated the effect of fluctuating light, temperature, and humidity in an indoor environment on plant performance. Seven plant species from different functional plant types were grown outdoors during summer and spring. The same species were then grown in indoor growth chambers under different scenarios of climate complexity in terms of fluctuations of temperature, air humidity, and light: (1) fixed night and day conditions, (2) daily sinusoidal changes, and (3) variable conditions tracking the climate records from the field trials. In each scenario, the average of the environmental variables was the same as in the respective field trial. Productivity-, gas exchange-, and leaf pigment-traits were measured in all plants at the end of the experiments. The plant trait responses were highly dependent on species and treatment, but general trends were observed. The variable condition yielded lower biomass compared to the fixed and sinusoidal conditions, together with a higher specific leaf area and increased chlorophyll concentrations. A principal component analysis (PCA) across all plant traits in response to climatic conditions suggested that at least a sinusoidal fluctuation is recommended for a more natural-like plant performance in indoor growth facilities. However, prevailing significant differences for several traits between field- and indoor-grown plants even under variable climates indicate that additional factors other than those controllable in standard phytotrons (e.g., wind speed and direction, leaf and soil temperature) can still significantly bias plant performance in indoor facilities.",,,,,"Hoch, Guenter/H-1505-2018","Hoch, Guenter/0000-0003-0985-9746",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2223-7747,,,,OCT,2020,9,10,,,,,,,1312,10.3390/plants9101312,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants9101312,,,,,,,,33028014,,,,,WOS:000585350600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To validate field-based estimates of gastric evacuation rates and daily ration, a series of controlled laboratory experiments was completed for juvenile and sub-adult red drum (similar to 60-600 g). Influential factors examined included water temperature (17 degrees C and 27 degrees C), prey type (fish and crustacean prey), and red drum body size (small (x) over bar =76.3 g; large (x) over bar =4292 g). Average maximum consumption rate varied between red drum body sizes and water temperatures. Small drum fed at a mean (+/- SD) rate of 18.9 +/- 0.6% body mass d(-1) at 27 degrees C and 9.6 +/- 0.6% body mass d(-1) at 17 degrees C, while large drum fed at a rate of 12.5 +/- 0.8% body mass d(-1) at 27 degrees C and 6.3 +/- 0.4% body mass d(-1) at 17 degrees C. Gross growth efficiency was generally consistent across factors, ranging between 13.2 and 16.3%, with small red drum being slightly more efficient. The rate of gastric emptying was influenced most by temperature and ranged from 4.0 to 9.4%h(-1). The red drum body sizes and prey types we tested demonstrated only modest effects, with slightly faster evacuation rates by smaller red drum and for anchovy prey. Among the eight factor combinations (red drum size x water temperature x prey type) tested during gastric evacuation trials, half (four) of the relationships were best described by the square root model.

Yet when compared to other abiotic variables affecting clutch success, rainfall has received relatively little attention. We therefore examined how fluctuations in local rainfall at a tropical nesting site for leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) affected the nest environment.

Lack of detailed pH(x) measurements at high temporal resolution could be a potential source of error when evaluating [CO2*] dynamics. In this experiment, we performed continuous measurements of CO2 concentration ([CO2]) and stem temperature (T-stem), complemented with pH(x) measurements at 30-min intervals during the day at various stages of the growing season (Day of the Year (DOY): 86 (late winter), 128 (mid-spring) and 155 (early summer)) on a plum tree (Prunus domestica L. cv. Reine Claude d'Oullins). We used the recorded pH(x) to calculate [CO2*] based on T-stem and the corresponding measured [CO2]. No statistically significant difference was found between mean [CO2*] calculated with instantaneous pH(x) and daily average pH(x). However, using an average pH(x) value from a different part of the growing season than the measurements of [CO2] and T-stem to estimate [CO2*] led to a statistically significant error. The error varied between 3.25 +/- 0.01% under-estimation and 3.97 * 0.01% over-estimation, relative to the true [CO2*] data. Measured pH(x) did not show a significant daily variation, unlike [CO2], which increased during the day and declined at night. As the growing season progressed, daily average [CO2] (3.4%, 5.3%, 7.4%) increased and average pH(x) (5.43, 5.29, 5.20) decreased. Increase in [CO2] will increase its solubility in xylem sap according to Henry's law, and the dissociation of [CO2*] will negatively affect pH(x).

This review provides an outline of the temperature physiology of aquacultured groupers in tropical and sub-tropical regions as described in 34 research articles published between 1979 and 2018. A total of 24 grouper species (i.e., 23 Epinephelus spp. and 1 Cromileptes sp.) and 4 hybrids (Epinephelus spp.) were reported to be aquacultured for temperature physiology studies; among these species, five are considered threatened (three are vulnerable species, one is critically endangered, and one is endangered). More than half of the species (n = 13, 54 %) were categorized as Least Concern, while five species were considered Data Deficient. The overall test temperatures applied across the different life stages of the aquacultured groupers ranged from 13 degrees C to 35 degrees C, with a mean optimum rearing temperature of 26.32 degrees C +/- 0.62 degrees C. The majority of the experimental studies demonstrated that a rearing temperature of 28 degrees C could be optimal for grouper hatcheries in the Asia-Pacific. Although comparative experimental studies on the mean daily growth of groupers showed higher increments in recirculating hatchery tanks compared with those in floating net cages in the tropics, temperature alone may not completely govern the grouper physiology. In-depth research is imperative for precise predictions of the future prospects of sustainable grouper aquaculture, especially in the tropics.",,,,,"Noor, Noorashikin/AAJ-9665-2020; Mazumder, Sabuj Kanti/AFL-4868-2022","Md Noor, Noorashikin/0000-0002-6747-5997; Das, Simon Kumar/0000-0003-0628-9995",,,,,,,,,,,,,2352-5134,,,,,JUL,2021,20,,,,,,,,100682,10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100682,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100682,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000672576000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

At temperatures <= 27 degrees C, there was no significant difference observed in survival. At 28 degrees C, mortality increased, survival was lower (21%) in the starvation group than in the feeding group (46%), and weight loss was the highest (15%) in the starvation group.

Triglyceride, cholesterol, and protein levels gradually decreased with long-term starvation. Survival was not affected by water temperature drop <= 27 degrees C after starvation/feeding.

Previous authors have suggested that if these fluctuations are not applied in synchrony, a stress effect could be present since plants have evolved to cope with synchronic environmental fluctuations. This study aimed to identify the effect of disparity in fluctuations of two important environmental variables, light quantity and temperature, on the growth of seven plant species from different functional plant types. A full-factorial combination of light and temperature under fixed or variable conditions was applied in phytotrons, and plant performance under these conditions was compared with a previous field trial. In all phytotron treatments, the average light and temperature conditions were the same as in the initial field trial. Productivity, leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, pigmentation, and other leaf traits were recorded in all species at the end of the experiments. Most plant trait responses were highly dependent on species and treatment, but some general trends were observed. Light fluctuations were mainly responsible for increases in specific leaf area (SLA) and chlorophyll a concentration, as well as for reductions in total dry weight and chlorophyll a/b ratio, independent if in combination with fluctuation or fixed temperatures. When fixed light conditions were combined with variable temperatures, the plants showed on average lower F-v/F-m values, A(max), and CO2 yield, while under variable light conditions and fixed temperatures, F-v/F-m increased compared with fully fixed or variable conditions. Although significant differences of plant traits between the field trial and all phytotron treatments were present (likely due to differences in other parameters that were not controlled in the phytotrons), our results still suggest that a synchronous variation of environmental factors lead to a more natural-like plant growth than if these factors are fixed or vary asynchronously.",,,,,"Hoch, Guenter/H-1505-2018","Hoch, Guenter/0000-0003-0985-9746; Chiang, Camilo/0000-0003-4253-9904",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2073-4395,,,,APR,2021,11,4,,,,,,,755,10.3390/agronomy11040755,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11040755,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000642672500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, responses of soil ecosystem engineers, such as earthworms, to annual temperature dynamics are virtually unknown. We studied growth, mortality and cocoon production of epigeic earthworm species (Lumbricus rubellus and Dendrobaena octaedra) exposed to temperature fluctuations in root-free soil of a mid-European beech oak forest. Both earthworm species (3 + 3 individuals of each species) were kept in microcosms containing soil stratified into L, F + H and A(h) horizons. In the field, earthworm responses to smoothing of diurnal temperature fluctuations were studied, simulating possible global change. In the laboratory, earthworm responses to seasonal (+/- 5 degrees C of the annual mean) and diurnal temperature fluctuations (+/- 5 degrees C of the seasonal levels) were analyzed in a two-factorial design. Both experiments lasted 12 months to differentiate between seasonal and diurnal responses. In the third experiment overwintering success of both earthworm species was investigated by comparing effects of constant temperature regime (+2 degrees C), and daily or weekly temperature fluctuations (2 degrees C +/- 5 degrees C). Temperature regime strongly affected population performance of the earthworms studied. In the field, smoothed temperature fluctuations beneficially affected population development of both earthworm species (higher biomass, faster maturity and reproduction, lower mortality). Consequently, density of both species increased faster at smoothed than at ambient temperature conditions. In the laboratory, responses of L rubellus and D. octaedra to temperature treatments differed; however, in general, earthworms benefited from the absence of diurnal fluctuations. Total earthworm numbers were at a maximum at constant temperature and lowest in the treatment with both diurnal and seasonal temperature fluctuations. However, after one year L rubellus tended to dominate irrespective of the temperature regime. In the overwintering experiment L. rubellus sensitively responded to even short-term winter frost and went extinct after one week of frost whereas D. octaedra much better tolerated frost conditions. Earthworms of both species which survived frosts were characterized by a significant body weight decrease during the period of frosts and fast recovery in spring suggesting a different pattern of individual resource expenditure as compared with constant +2 degrees C winter regime. Contrasting trends in the population dynamics of L rubellus and D. octaedra during the frost-free period and during winter suggest that in the long-term temperature fluctuations contribute to the coexistence of decomposer species of similar trophic position in the forest litter. The results are discussed in context of consequences of climate change for the functioning of soil systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The modeled daily average temperature was 0.25 degrees C lower under present than past land-use conditions. During the day, changes in temperature showed a heterogeneous spatial pattern that depended on the type of the land-use conversion and its geographic location. In areas where afforestation took place, an average warming of more than 1.0 degrees C was observed. In contrast, deforestation resulted in a cooling of up to 2.0 degrees C. Furthermore, an average increase in the water vapor mixing ratio of 0.2 g kg(-1) was simulated during the day. During the night, the average temperature was up to 0.6 degrees C lower under present land-use conditions. This nighttime cooling is mainly restricted to low-lying areas on the formerly frequently inundated plains. The diurnal temperature range in the area of land-use changes increased by 0.1 degrees-0.3 degrees C. The sensitivity experiments showed that the daytime temperature decrease was mainly caused by morphological changes, while the altered physiological properties are the dominant factor for the nighttime cooling.

Anatomically the locations chosen to compare body temperature values were the rectum, rumen, peritoneal cavity, and subcutaneous. Results from the study demonstrate that there were no differences (P > 0.05) among body temperatures recorded at these distinct anatomical locations, and that the temperatures followed a similar response pattern. Advantages and disadvantages were also noted for each of the temperature devices used in the study.

Based on the observed X-band horizontal polarization low elevation angle microwave radiation data and the meteorological data at the same time, this study investigated the generation mechanism of low elevation angle brightness temperature (LEATB) and its relationship with meteorological data, i.e., temperature, humidity, and wind speed, under low sea state. As a result, one could find that the LEATB was sensitive to the atmosphere at the elevation angle between 1 degrees to 3 degrees, and a diurnal variation of the LEATB reached up to 10 K. This study also found a linear relationship between the LEATB and sea surface wind speed under low sea state at an elevation range from -3 degrees to 0 degrees, i.e., the brightness temperature decreased as the wind speed increased, which was inconsistent with the observations at the elevation angle from -10 degrees to -5 degrees. The variation of the LEATB difference according to the change in the over-the-horizon detection capability (OTHDC) of the shipborne microwave radar was examined to identify the reason for this phenomenon theoretically. The results showed that the LEATB difference was significantly influenced by a change in the OTHDC. Further, this study examined a remote sensing method to extract the sea surface wind speed data from experimental LEATB data under low sea state. The results demonstrated that the X-band horizontal polarization LEATBs were useful to retrieve the sea surface wind speed data at a reasonable accuracy-the root mean square error of 0.02408 m/s.

Galaxias gollumoides displayed intraspecific spawning timing differences with wetland-sourced G. gollumoides spawning earlier than stream-sourced G. gollumoides. Spawning also occurred significantly more often during peaks of warmer mean daily water temperature and barometric pressure, than during colder temperature, low-pressure periods. Interannual variation in initial spawning timing was also attributed to differences in water temperature.

Excessive irrigation may result in low soil temperature and a waste of water resources. In this paper, field experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence of irrigation methods and biochar application on soil temperature. The experiment included six treatments: (a) YB: biochar application in border irrigation with Yellow River water; (b) GB: biochar application in border irrigation with groundwater; (c) DB: biochar application in drip irrigation with groundwater; (d) Y(CK): border irrigation with Yellow River water; (e) G(CK): border irrigation with groundwater; (f) D(CK): drip irrigation with groundwater. The results are as follows: coupling drip irrigation and biochar, soil temperature increased by 1.20-3.87%. In the biochar application in border irrigation with Yellow River water and groundwater, soil temperature increased by 0.80-2.40% and 1.01-5.15%, respectively. Biochar is a medium for reducing the heat exchange of soil and atmosphere, as it hinders bi-directional heat movement. This mechanism was especially apparent at a 0-10 cm soil depth in the treatments of border irrigation using Yellow River water and groundwater. Biochar may help stabilize the fluctuation of soil temperature and improve the soil accumulated temperature. The effect of drip irrigation at 5-10 cm depth, border irrigation using the groundwater and the Yellow River water was great on soil temperatures above the 10 cm level but less on deep soil temperatures. After applying biochar to soil, the soil temperature was more sensitive to external temperature changes, such as air temperature and water temperature. Therefore, in the Hetao irrigation area, applying a proper amount of biochar to farmland soil was shown to improve the water and heat environment and improve the effectiveness of traditional border irrigation in synchronizing water and heat, especially under the drip irrigation condition. The results here suggest that using biochar under drip irrigation can promote growth and increase yield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2073-4441,,,,,MAR 10,2019,11,3,,,,,,,499,10.3390/w11030499,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11030499,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000464529700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We maintained naturally fluctuating temperatures from 2 nearby streams and a 3(rd) regime, naturally fluctuating temperatures warmed by 3-5 degrees C, in flow-through troughs from mid-summer until autumn. We added selected abundant Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera species to the 3 treatments in late July and observed emergence until early December. We described the taxon-specific responses of the caddisfly Psychoglypha bella and the mayfly Paraleptophlebia bicornuta, both of which survived well in the troughs (67-86%), and the stonefly Mesocapnia projecta, which we did not collect in mid-summer but had colonized all experimental troughs by October. We observed primarily phenological rather than morphological responses to higher water temperatures. The most synchronous emergence of male and female P. bella and P. bicornuta occurred in the trough with the coolest temperatures. Only P. bella emerged asynchronously from the trough with the warmest temperatures. The decreases in synchrony were largely the result of earlier emergence of males. Paraleptophlebia bicornuta were larger and tended towards asynchrony in the trough with water (and temperatures) from their natal stream. Individuals in the trough with the warmest temperature were smaller than individuals in other troughs, but did not emerge earlier. Mesocapnia projecta showed greater synchrony in emergence, which occurred over a shorter interval, than the other species. When exposed to increased water temperatures, autumn-emergent taxa may be most vulnerable to trade-offs between asynchronous emergence and the probabilities for finding mates in unpredictable weather conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0887-3593,,,,,JUN,2011,30,2,,,,,474,484,,10.1899/10-024.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/10-024.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290361600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The obtained temperature patterns of water and sediments to a depth of similar to 1.4 m show sudden large changes. Bottom water temperature fluctuated between 2.9 and 4 degrees C, and the sediment geothermal gradient changed from -360 to +170 mK/m for the period of measurements. Water temperature became 0.6 degrees C warmer through November and suddenly switched to cooling after 5 December, and the drop reached 1.15 degrees C for the following 22 days. The change in water temperature caused the respective change in sediments, namely, gave rise to a positive geothermal gradient.

Recrystallisation of ice due to fluctuations in storage temperature can induce microstructural modifications of meat products, leading to irreversible cell and tissue damage, degrading the quality of frozen meat during storage. To explore the effects of temperature fluctuation on the quality of frozen beef, four experimental groups were used in this study: storage at a constant -18 +/- 0.1 degrees C, and fluctuations between -18 to -17 degrees C, -18 to -15 degrees C, and -18 to -13 degrees C. The parameters analysed were drip loss, colour, muscle fibre morphology, pore distribution, and Pearson correlation coefficients. Experimental results showed that, with an increase in temperature fluctuation, the rate of drip loss increased, redness (a*) decreased, yellowness (b*) increased, while chroma (C*) expressed negative correlation. Computed Tomography scans showed that with the increase in temperature fluctuation, the fibre structure of meat gradually collapsed, porosity increased, and the pore volume increased steadily. The number of pores, however, demonstrated a decreasing trend. Scanning electron microscopy showed that increasing temperature fluctuation damaged the dimensional structure of the fibre and increased the pore diameter. Pearson correlation coefficients showed that porosity, pore volume, and pore diameter were significantly correlated to each other, which were also correlated to drip loss, a*, and b*. The structural changes due to temperature fluctuations affect the colour and final meat quality of frozen beef. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

Natural communities were exposed for a month to ambient, elevated constant temperatures and diurnal fluctuating temperature regimes with elevated peak maxima, to mimic realistic future climate conditions. Abundance, biodiversity, community composition and functional diversity were assessed. Differential responses between a tropical and a temperate community were revealed. The tropical nematode assemblage was more tolerant to the elevated constant than to the fluctuating temperature regime, whereas the temperate assemblage was equally affected by both. Shifts in dominance of temperature-tolerant species in elevated constant and fluctuating temperature treatments (due to temperature variations) were observed and explained by a combination of differential tolerances and shifts in species interactions.

For this reason, several studies have addressed the effects of heat stress and possible solutions to alleviate its impact on rabbit performance. This article describes the design and operating features of a large temperature chamber (13x4.7x3.1 m) configured to house 42 rabbits. The probes consisted of temperature sensor model DS2438 and humidity sensor model HIH-5031. The system was controlled by an Arduino platform programmed by its Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software. The system takes a decision every minute: it connects the heating if the temperature is lower than programmed and connects exhaust fans if the temperature is over the programmed setting. To renew the indoor air, every 5 min the system switches off the heating and switches on the exhaust fans for 15 s. Two experiments (with and without animals) were carried out to test the temperature control accuracy. Firstly, without animals, 2 tests were performed: (i) adjusting the temperature of the climatic chamber to the control house temperature plus 10 degrees C and (ii) based on daily minimum (32 degrees C) and maximum (37 degrees C) temperatures. Secondly, with animals, does were maintained (i) between a daily minimum (32 degrees C) and maximum (37 degrees C) for 48 h and (ii) between a daily minimum (25 degrees C) and maximum (35 degrees C) temperatures for 105 d. Mortality rates were noted in both tests. The results of comparing the measured temperature deviation from programmed temperature reported a coefficient of determination of 0.9850 and 0.9947, for plus 10 degrees C and 32-37 degrees C curves, respectively. In the animal tests, the determination coefficients were 0.9926 and 0.9928 for programmed curve in the range of 32 to 37 degrees C and 0.9859, 0.9900 and 0.9901 for programmed curve in the range of 25 to 35 degrees C. Survival of females in the temperature chamber was as expected for reproductive rabbit does: 100 and 82% in the 2 and 105 d trials, respectively.

Long-short photoperiod regimes, i.e. long days of LD18:6 followed by an abrupt change to short days of LD6:18, were used to advance or delay maturation to summer months, producing commercially desirable out-of-season eggs. At the same time, these fish were exposed to two different seasonal water temperatures supplied by river (range 0-20.5degreesC) or borehole (range 7.0-10.5degreesC) sources. The photoperiod regime was seen to have the primary effect on altering the timing of maturation and appeared similar, irrespective of the prevailing water temperature. However, water temperature had a modulating effect on time of maturation and ovulation; fish showing an ability to delay the timing of final maturation and ovulation, when temperatures were at extremes, high or low. Extreme temperatures, also, had a major effect on the later stages of ovary development and subsequent egg quality. When the major time of spawning was advanced to July-August, when river water temperatures regularly approach 20degreesC, a dysfunction in ovarian development occurred, and no viable eggs were obtainable in these conditions. When the maximum water temperature was reduced to 16degreesC, fish stripped in a normal fashion, but egg quality was significantly reduced.

In a semiarid region of the Loess Plateau in China, the R-s of moss-dominated biocrusts was continuously (104 days) measured in summer through an automated soil respiration system, and their relationships with soil temperature and moisture at 2, 5, and 10 cm depths were intensively analyzed. The results showed the biocrusts had 115% higher (t = - 3.82, P < 0.001) R-s during day and 44% higher (t = -10.22, P < 0.001) R-s during night as compared with the underlying soil; they averagely increased R-s by 81% (2.52 vs. 1.39 mu mol(-2)s(-1)) across day and night. More specifically, the R-s of biocrusts ranged from 0.33 to 6.33 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) in wet conditions (soil moisture >= 0.15 cm(3) cm(-3)) and 0.27 to 2.83 mu mol m(2)s(-1) in dry conditions (soil moisture = 0.05 cm(3)cm(-3)), with a daily mean of 2.11 mu mol m(-2)s(-1). Particularly, in wet conditions the R-s of biocrusts had positive responses to increasing temperature, and their relationship was well fitted with an exponential function (R-2 <= 0.44; P < 0.001), with a Q(10) value ranging between 1.73 and 2.08. Similarly, the R-s of biocrusts was positively correlated with soil moisture, but their relationship was not well fitted with the quadratic function (R-2 <= 0.22). A model based on the soil moisture and temperature at 2 cm depth performed much better (R-2 = 0.53; P < 0.001) with R-s than that based on the soil moisture and temperature at 5 or 10 cm depth or even air temperature. In conclusion, moss biocrusts made a significant contribution to soil respiration in semiarid ecosystem, firstly (and directly) due to the rich and diversified microbial communities in biocrust layer and secondly (and indirectly) due to the biocrust effects on soil temperature and moisture regimes. The temperature and moisture at 2 cm depth (biocrust layer) should be employed with a higher priority in simulating R-s of biocrusted surfaces, rather than the commonly used soil depth (5 cm) in estimating R-s of the ordinary soil without biocrusts.",,,,,"Xiao, Bo/F-9722-2013","Xiao, Bo/0000-0002-9544-4207",,,,,,,,,,,,,0341-8162,1872-6887,,,,DEC,2019,183,,,,,,,,104195,10.1016/j.catena.2019.104195,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.104195,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000488417700017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Modification of the composition of cropping systems by incorporating crop species with greater growth and yield performance at higher temperatures is an important adaptation option. Accordingly, the principal objective of the present work was to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the differential temperature sensitivities of tropical crops to increase resilience of smallholder farming systems in the tropics to climate change, taking tomato and chilli in a case study. Tomato (cv. Thilina) and chilli (cv. MI-Green) crops were grown with adequate water, nutrients and recommended crop protection in a multi-locational field experiment traversing an attitudinal gradient (15-1200 m), which represented a gradient in seasonal mean temperature (T-a) ranging from 18.7 to 30 degrees C, over four consecutive seasons (Dec. 2012-Oct. 2014) in the humid- and sub-humid zones of Sri Lanka. Temperature response functions were estimated by linear regression of growth and yield parameters against Ta. Across the tested range of Ta, fruit yield of tomato showed a significant negative linear trend with increasing Ta (@ 2.83 Mg ha(-1) degrees C-1) while the pod yield of chilli showed a significant positive linear trend (@ 0.51 Mg ha(-1) degrees C-1). While the total biomass accumulation followed the same trend as fruit/pod yield, the harvest index of both crops showed significant negative trends, thus indicating the sensitivity of reproductive processes to increasing temperature. In tomato, fruit yield was significantly positively correlated to individual fruit weight, which decreased significantly with increasing temperature. In contrast, in chilli, pod yield was significantly positively correlated to number of pods per plant, which increased significantly with increasing temperature. These findings demonstrate the possibility of increasing the resilience of annual cropping systems in the tropical zone to future climate change by modifying their species composition via replacement of crops that are sensitive to higher temperatures (e.g. tomato) with those that are tolerant (e.g. chilli). The corresponding response functions to seasonal temperature extremes showed that biomass production, its partitioning to yield and yield of both crops were more sensitive to increases in seasonal mean daytime maximum temperature than to increases in night-time minimum temperature. However, yield responses to the diurnal temperature difference showed that differential sensitivity of the two crops to night-time minimum temperatures also played a significant role in determining their yield responses. These findings are useful in designing future cropping systems with greater resilience to climate change.",,,,,"Suriyagoda, Lalith/AAX-1940-2021","Kumara, J B D A P/0000-0003-1176-1246",,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-8809,1873-2305,,,,JUL 1,2018,261,,,,,,103,114,,10.1016/j.agee.2017.10.027,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.10.027,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000432511600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pregnant females should be particularly efficient for thermoregulation because healthy embryos develop at a narrow temperature range, a potential problem in the context of current global warming. To test the idea that pregnant lizards adjust their thermoregulatory behaviour to rising temperatures, we set up an experiment with 40 pregnant Sceloporus adleri and measured daily activity and basking time at different treatments (22,24,26 and 28 degrees C) for six consecutive days. Basking time significantly decreased with increasing temperature. Lizards were more active in the earliest two time periods of the day (0800-1030 and 1030-1300 hours) when compared to later hours (1530-1800) for all treatments, although the trend was less pronounced at 24 and 26 C. Unexpectedly, the probability of activity for lizards increased at 28 degrees C. All lizards maintained a body temperature without significant differences across treatments. These results suggest that pregnant S. adleri females are able to adjust their behavioural thermoregulation to different thermal environments in a short period of time to maintain an adequate body temperature for key physiological processes such as development and growth of their offspring.",,,,,"Martínez-Meyer, Enrique/AAZ-7352-2020","Martínez-Meyer, Enrique/0000-0003-1184-9264",,,,,,,,,,,,,0268-0130,,,,,JAN,2014,24,1,,,,,41,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000334326700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Growth rate, biochemical composition, and photosynthetic activity of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii were determined under two different light scenarios over a temperature range of 5-15 degrees C to simulate conditions experienced by cells during winter deep convection. These metrics were examined under a low light scenario (20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 12/12 h light/dark), and compared with a scenario of short light pulses of a higher light intensity (120 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 2/22 hlight/dark). Both experimental light conditions offered the same daily light dose. No growth was observed at temperatures below 8 degrees C. Above 8 degrees C, growth rates were significantly higher under low light conditions compared with those of short pulsed light exposures, indicating a higher efficiency of light utilization. This could be related to (i) a higher content of Chl a per cell in the lowlight trial and/or (ii) a more efficient transfer of light energy into growth as indicated by constantly low carbohydrate levels. In contrast, pulsed intense light led to an accumulation of carbohydrates, which were catabolized during the longer dark period for maintaining metabolism. Light curves measured via Chl a fluorescence indicated low light assimilation for the algae exposed to short pulsed light. We postulate that our trial with short light pluses did not provide sufficient light to reach full light saturation. In general, photosynthesis was more strongly affected by temperature under pulsed light than under low light conditions. Our results indicate that model estimates of primary production in relation to deep convection, which are based on average low light conditions, not considering vertical transportation of algae will lead to an overestimation of in situ primary production.",,,,,,"St John, Michael/0000-0002-5593-7488",,,,,,,,,,,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,JUL-AUG,2015,72,6,,,,,2061,2071,,10.1093/icesjms/fsu218,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsu218,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000359696500031,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objectives of the study were to determine variability in the response of stem CO2 efflux to stem temperature over the season and to observe differences in the calculated relationship between stem temperature and CO2 efflux based on full growing season data or on data divided into periods according to stem growth rate. Temperature sensitivity of stem CO2 efflux (Q(10)) calculated for the established periods ranged between 1.61 and 3.46 and varied over the season, with the lowest values occurring in July and August. Q(10) calculated using data from the full growing seasons ranged between 2.30 and 2.94 and was often significantly higher than Q(10) calculated for the individual periods. Temperature-normalized stem CO2 efflux (R-10) determined using Q(10) from growing season data was overestimated when the temperature was below 10 degrees C and underestimated when the temperature was above 10 degrees C, compared with R-10 calculated using Q(10) established for the individual periods. The differences in daily mean R-10 calculated by these two approaches ranged between -0.9 and 0.2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1).

Sources of experimental errors are many and are not always adequately controlled. For statistical analysis, the more common problems include the assumption of a linear relationship between temperature and development rate over the whole temperature range and extrapolation or subjective vertical cutoff of the rate function in rate summation for varying temperatures. Development-time data of 26 species were selected for the analysis. For each species, the expected development time under each varying temperature regime was estimated by integrating constant temperature development rates over the 24-h varying temperature cycle. These estimates were then compared with the development times observed under the corresponding varying temperature regimes, and the significance of the differences was evaluated. The results as a whole suggest that the differences in development times between constant and varying temperatures could usually be accounted for by the effect of rate summation based on the curvilinear relationship between temperature and rate of development. The possible physiological mechanisms that act in addition to the rate-summation effect are briefly discussed.

Despite the potential importance of natural variability such as diurnal temperature fluctuations, most experimental studies on warming are conducted under stable temperatures. Here, we investigated whether the responses of an aquatic invertebrate grazer (Lymnaea stagnalis) to an increased average temperature differ when the thermal regime is either constant or fluctuates diurnally. Using thermal response curves for several life-history and immune defense traits, we first identified the optimum and near-critically high temperatures that Lymnaea potentially experience during summer heat waves. We then exposed individuals that originated from three different populations to these two temperatures under constant or fluctuating thermal conditions. After 7 days, we assessed growth, reproduction, and two immune parameters (phenoloxidase-like activity and antibacterial activity of hemolymph) from each individual. Exposure to the near-critically high temperature led to increased growth rates and decreased antibacterial activity of hemolymph compared to the optimum temperature, whilst temperature fluctuations had no effect on these traits. The results indicate that the temperature level per se, rather than the variability in temperature was the main driver altering trait responses in our study species. Forecasting responses in temperature-related responses remains challenging, due to system-specific properties that can include intraspecific variation. However, our study indicates that experiments examining the effects of warming using constant temperatures can give similar predictions as studies with fluctuating thermal dynamics, and may thus be useful indicators of responses in nature.",,,,,"Burdon, Francis/ABC-2827-2020","Burdon, Francis/0000-0002-5398-4993; Seppala, Otto/0000-0001-7902-3069; Salo, Tiina/0000-0002-5409-2612",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,OCT,2019,9,20,,,,,11695,11706,,10.1002/ece3.5666,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5666,,SEP 2019,,,,,,31695879,,,,,WOS:000487784400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding how the environment regulates seed-bank dormancy changes is essential for forecasting seedling emergence in actual and future climatic scenarios, and to interpret studies of dormancy mechanisms at physiological and molecular levels. Here, we used a population threshold modelling approach to analyse dormancy changes through variations in the thermal range permissive for germination in buried seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana Cvi, a winter annual ecotype. Results showed that changes in dormancy level were mainly associated with variations in the higher limit of the thermal range permissive for germination. Changes in this limit were positively related to soil temperature during dormancy release and induction, and could be predicted using thermal time. From this, we developed a temperature-driven simulation to predict the fraction of the seed bank able to germinate in a realistic global warming scenario that approximated seedling emergence timing. Simulations predicted, in accordance with seedling emergence observed in the field, an increase in the fraction of the seed bank able to emerge as a result of global warming.

The data are compared with buoy and ship-based measurements of SST, and show good agreement. The radiometric measurements, corrected for surface emissivity effects, show diurnal warming which precedes warming measured by sub-surface buoy sensors. Mesoscale surface features are also seen which have spatial dimensions similar to those of tropical cloud clusters in the wavelength range of 1-100 km. Significant horizontal temperature gradients of 1 degrees C occur in less than 10 km. On some days, the gradients can be directly related to precipitation. Clouds appear to create 'imprints' of their structure on the ocean surface by shielding incoming solar radiation, consistent with calculations of such a process using a one-dimensional ocean mixed layer model. Measurements of the height of the well-mixed region of the boundary layer and air potential temperature show a positive relation with increasing SST. An increase in buoyancy flux with increasing SST is identified with mesoscale sub-cloud processes in fair weather conditions, and suggests that SST maxima on scales of 10-50 km enhance the transfer of moisture in the boundary layer by natural convection processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 15,1997,102,C7,,,,,15733,15747,,10.1029/97JC00469,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97JC00469,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XL45200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Responses of soil respiration to temperature fluctuations were investigated in a root-free soil of a mid-European beech-oak forest. First, in laboratory we analysed the efflux of CO2 from soil microcosms exposed to seasonal (+/- 5 degrees C of the annual mean) and diurnal fluctuations (+/- 5 degrees C of the seasonal levels) in a two-factorial design. Second, in field microcosms we investigated effects of smoothing diurnal temperature fluctuations in soil (simulating a possible global trend) on CO2 efflux. Third, the natural temperature regime was simulated in laboratory microcosms and their CO2 efflux was compared to the one in the field. The experiments lasted for 1 year to differentiate seasonal and annual responses. Dynamics of CO2 efflux, microbial basal respiration, biomass and qO(2) varied with seasonal temperature regime. However, in the laboratory the annual cumulative CO2-C production did not differ between treatments and varied between 10.9% and 11.7% of the total microcosm C, disregarding seasonal and/or diurnal fluctuations. The similarity of cumulative C production suggests that the availability of microbially mobilisable carbon pools rather than the temperature regime limited soil respiration. Diurnal fluctuations generally did not affect CO2 efflux and microbial activity, though winter Q(10) values were increased in their absence. Simulation of the natural temperature regime in the laboratory resulted in CO2 efflux similar to field microcosms. In the field, rates of CO2 efflux and microbial activity, seasonal and annual cumulative CO2-C production were significantly higher at smoothed than at natural temperature conditions (annually 13.1% and 11.0% of total C was respired, respectively).

One component of the developmental environment, which is likely central to early life oxidative stress among ectothermic and oviparous species, is that of temperature. We investigated how incubation temperature manipulations affect oxidative damage and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) hatchlings. First, to determine whether temperature fluctuations elicit oxidative stress, eggs from clutches were randomly assigned to either a constant (29.5 degrees C) or daily fluctuating temperature incubation (28.7 +/- 3 degrees C) treatment. Second, to assess the effect of temperature fluctuation frequency on oxidative stress, eggs were incubated in one of three fluctuating incubation regimes: 28.7 +/- 3 degrees C fluctuations every 12 h (hyper), 24 h (normal) or 48 h (hypo). Third, we tested the influence of average incubation temperature by incubating eggs in a daily fluctuating incubation temperature regime with a mean temperature of 26.5 degrees C (low), 27.1 degrees C (medium) or 27.7 degrees C (high). Although the accumulation of oxidative damage in hatchlings was unaffected by any thermal manipulation, TAC was affected by both temperature fluctuation frequency and average incubation temperature. Individuals incubated with a low frequency of temperature fluctuations had reduced TAC, while incubation at a lower average temperature was associated with enhanced TAC. These results indicate that although sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, TAC is influenced by developmental thermal environments, potentially because of temperature-mediated changes in metabolic rate. The observed differences in TAC may have important future consequences for hatchling fitness and overwinter survival.",,,,,,"Treidel, Lisa/0000-0001-9390-8306",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,FEB 1,2016,219,4,,,,,561,570,,10.1242/jeb.128843,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.128843,,,,,,,,26685171,,,,,WOS:000370238000017,View Full Record in Web of Science

These syntopic species have similar ecologies and morphologies and thus potential for large overlaps in diet and habitat use. Unexpectedly, they displayed different T-b patterns. Western rock elephant shrews were heterothermic, with all individuals decreasing T-b below 30 degrees C on at least 34% of nights. The level of heterothermy expressed was similar to other species traditionally defined as daily heterotherms and was inversely related to T-a, as is commonly seen in small heterothermic endotherms. In contrast, Cape rock elephant shrews rarely allowed their T-b to decrease below 30 degrees C. The level of heterothermy was similar to species traditionally defined as homeotherms and there was no relationship between the level of heterothermy expressed and T-a. In both species, the minimum daily T-b was recorded almost exclusively at night, often shortly before sunrise, although in some individuals minimum T-b occasionally occurred during the day.

Pollen was obtained from male-fertile plants given optimal growth conditions. This allowed comparison of mean daily temperatures from 25-29 degrees C; day/night temperature differentials (DIFs) of 2, 6, and 10 degrees C; day temperatures of 28, 30 and 32 degrees C at night temperatures of 22, 24, and 26 degrees C; and night temperatures of 22, 24 and 26 degrees C at day temperatures of 28, 30 and 32 degrees C.

The primary parameter affecting these variables was mean daily temperature, with day temperature having a secondary role. thus, in determining reproductive responses of tomato to temperatures within this range, day temperature, night temperature and DIFs do not need to be considered independently of their effect on mean daily temperature.

Changes in temperature alter properties of neurons and, consequently, have an impact on the processing of information. Nevertheless, nervous system function is often maintained over a broad temperature range, exhibiting a surprising robustness to variations in temperature. A special problem arises for acoustically communicating insects, as in these animals mate recognition and mate localization typically rely on the decoding of fast amplitude modulations in calling and courtship songs. In the auditory periphery, however, temporal resolution is constrained by intrinsic neuronal noise. Such noise predominantly arises from the stochasticity of ion channel gating and potentially impairs the processing of sensory signals. On the basis of intracellular recordings of locust auditory neurons, we show that intrinsic neuronal variability on the level of spikes is reduced with increasing temperature. We use a detailed mathematical model including stochastic ion channel gating to shed light on the underlying biophysical mechanisms in auditory receptor neurons: because of a redistribution of channel-induced current noise toward higher frequencies and specifics of the temperature dependence of the membrane impedance, membrane potential noise is indeed reduced at higher temperatures. This finding holds under generic conditions and physiologically plausible assumptions on the temperature dependence of the channels' kinetics and peak conductances. We demonstrate that the identified mechanism also can explain the experimentally observed reduction of spike timing variability at higher temperatures.",,,,,,"Eberhard, Monika J.

We measured maximum, mean daily (24 hour) and mean daytime (sunrise to sunset) temperatures of fairy circles and matrices in the NamibRand Nature Reserve (southwest Namibia). Optimum germination and growing temperatures, and thermal maxima of Stipagrostis ciliata, a grass commonly associated with fairy circle grasslands, were determined experimentally in growth trials. Seeds and seedlings were exposed to temperatures of 35 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 41 degrees C, 44 degrees C and 47 degrees C for 10 days. The optimum growth temperature range of S. ciliata seedlings was determined to be 35 C to 37 degrees C, with depressed growth above 47 degrees C. Seed germination was also depressed at 47 degrees C, and optimal germination occurred between 35 degrees C to 37 degrees C. Circle soils were consistently 2 degrees C cooler than matrix soils at both surface and 15 cm depths, and though the soil surface achieved daily temperatures of 45 degrees C and 47 degrees C for the circle and matrix respectively, mean daily temperatures at 15 cm depth were 36 degrees C and 38 degrees C respectively, coinciding with the optimum germination and growing temperature of S. ciliata. Circle soil temperature is thus unlikely to limit S. ciliata germination and seedling growth and contribute to the maintenance of a bare disc, as both thermal conditions and the presence of higher soil moisture on circles provide a more favourable growing environment than the matrix.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,MAY 20,2019,14,5,,,,,,,e0217153,10.1371/journal.pone.0217153,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0217153,,,,,,,,31107927,,,,,WOS:000468285200032,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results showed that although the percentage of the successfully grafted plants from variant I was higher - 83.33%, the respective percentage, obtained on the field could be considered as acceptable -52.78 and 61.11%. Obviously the established slight decrease was due to the 24-hours fluctuations of the air temperature under the uncontrolled conditions on the field. The climatic analysis made showed that the air temperature characteristics during the envisaged period (June-August) of the experimental 2003 were in the norm.

The response of oxygen consumption to a temperature rise was conformed to partial metabolic compensation. No compensatory response was observed at lower temperature. A sudden temperature increase by 12 degreesC resulted an overshoot in oxygen consumption in shrimp adapted to 19 degreesC, while a sudden decrease by 12 degreesC in shrimp adapted to 19 degreesC resulted in an undershoot in oxygen Consumption. The shrimp adapted to 31 degreesC responded with an undershoot in oxygen consumption when a sudden temperature drop by 12 degreesC occurred. But overshoot in oxygen consumption did not occur when the shrimps were transferred back from 19 to 31 degreesC. The amplitude of oxygen consumption was reduced in shrimp during the process of acclimation to the temperature diel fluctuation. After the shrimp had adapted to the temperature fluctuation, the daily mean oxygen consumption of shrimp at diel temperature fluctuation from 24 to 30 degreesC was significantly lower than those adapted to the constant temperature at 27 degreesC (P < 0.05). The decrease in metabolic rate may account for the increase in the growth rate of shrimp at a diel fluctuating thermal regime. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We radio-tracked 40 adult Lithobates [Rana] pipiens to assess habitat selection and movements at three scales (home range, weekly activity center, and daily microhabitat) in response to a control and three forest management strategies: clearcutting, clearcutting with coarse woody debris retention, and partial harvesting (50% canopy cover retained). At the home range scale, frogs selected the ponds as opposed to the surrounding terrestrial environment; whereas, weekly activity centers were 1.5 times more likely to have little canopy cover (mean = 15% vs. 42% cover at random sites). Weekly activity centers also had more standing water (mean = 46% vs. 5% cover), greater soil moisture (mean = 44% vs. 32% volumetric water content), and 4.7 degrees C warmer temperatures than random activity centers. Frogs selected daily microhabitats dominated by live vegetation with moister litter and soil, more standing water, and 0.3 degrees C warmer temperatures than random. Frog movements were on average almost twice as long in the unharvested control as the other treatments and the pond. Moisture appeared to be a dominant driver of habitat selection at all three scales. Selection for forested areas was strongest at the weekly activity center scale and seemed to be linked to thermoregulation and possibly cover from predator.

Heterogeneity in landscapes that is structured by ultimate (climate) and proximate (vegetation, topography, disturbance events, and land use) forces serve to shape thermal patterns across multiple spatio-temporal scales. Thermal landscapes of grasslands are likely shifting as woody encroachment fragments these ecosystems and studies quantifying thermal fragmentation in grassland systems resulting from woody encroachment are lacking. We utilized the August 21st, 2017, solar eclipse to mimic a rapid sunrise/sunset event across a landscape characterized as a grassland to experimentally manipulate levels of solar radiation in the system. We then quantified changes in near-surface temperatures resulting from changes in solar radiation levels during the eclipse. Temperatures were monitored across three grassland pastures in central Oklahoma that were characterized by different densities (low, medium, and high) of Juniperus virginiana to understand the impact of woody encroachment on diurnal temperature patterns and thermal heterogeneity in a grassland's thermal landscape. The largest temperature range across sites that occurred during the eclipse was in the mixed grass vegetation. Similarly, the largest change in thermal heterogeneity occurred in the grassland with the lowest amount of woody encroachment. Thermal heterogeneity was lowest in the highly encroached grassland, which also experienced the lowest overall change in thermal heterogeneity during the eclipse. Time series models suggested that solar radiation was the most influential factor in predicting changes in thermal heterogeneity as opposed to ambient temperature alone. These results suggest that highly encroached grasslands may experience lower diurnal variability of temperatures at the cost of a decrease in the overall thermal heterogeneity of that landscape. It appears that fine-scale spatio-temporal thermal variation is largely driven by solar radiation, which can be influenced by vegetation heterogeneity inherent within a landscape.",,,,,"Tanner, Evan/K-9325-2015; Fuhlendorf, Samuel/A-2931-2011","Tanner, Evan/0000-0003-0063-7004; Fuhlendorf, Samuel/0000-0002-8726-9402",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,OCT,2021,11,19,,,,,12886,12901,,10.1002/ece3.8043,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8043,,AUG 2021,,,,,,34646441,,,,,WOS:000689691800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hepatopancreas histological changes, plasma metabolites concentrations, relative mRNA expression of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and apoptosis in hepatopancreas and hemocyte were investigated. The results showed that with the decline of temperature, the number and volume of the secretory cells in hepatopancreas increased significantly, the tubule lumen appeared dilatated, and the epithelial cell layer became thinner. The contents of glucose (Glu) significantly decreased to the minimum value of 13 degrees C for 24 h.

Direct effects depend on ambient temperatures experienced by a single host individual during its lifetime. Indirect effects (or parental effects) occur when thermal conditions met by a host parental generation affect the way its offspring will interact with parasitoids. Using the complex involving eggs of the moth Lobesia botrana as hosts for the parasitoid Trichogramma cacoeciae, we developed an experimental design to disentangle the effects of (1) host parental temperature (temperature at which the host parental generation developed and laid host eggs) and (2) host offspring temperature (temperature at which host eggs were incubated following parasitism, i.e. direct thermal effects) on this interaction. The host parental generation was impacted by temperature experienced during its development: L. botrana females exposed to warmer conditions displayed a lower pupal mass but laid more host eggs over a 12-h period. Host parental temperature also affected the outcomes of the interaction. Trichogramma cacoeciae exhibited lower emergence rates but higher hind tibia length on emergence from eggs laid under warm conditions, even if they were themselves exposed to cooler temperatures. Such indirect thermal effects might arise from a low nutritional quality and/or a high immunity of host eggs laid in warm conditions.

Body dry weight (y, in mu g) related to the disc diameter (x, in mm) through the equation y = 22.33 x(1.99). The exponent 1.99 was significantly lower than that for the medusa stage, indicating a tendency to grow in diameter rather than in weight through the ephyra stage. The average ash-free dry weight (AFDW) of ephyrae was 38.0% of the dry weight. The AFDW/diameter relationship was used to convert measured diameters to body AFDW and calculate succession in body mass, daily ration, daily growth rate and gross growth efficiency. Effects of temperature (6, 9.5, 12, 15 and 18 degrees C) and salinity (17.5, 22, 26, 30.5 and 35 PSU) on these parameters and feeding were studied at saturated prey concentration (222 Artemia nauplii l(-1) initial concentration) by daily measurements over 10 d. There was a strong effect of temperature for total ingestion, growth rate, growth efficiency and final body mass of individual ephyrae, whereas the daily ration was not significantly different between the different temperatures. The experimental group kept at the highest temperature (18 degrees C) diverged the most, and ephyrae at this temperature ingested 2.7 times more and increased in weight 5.4 times more than at 6 degrees C. The average daily growth rate and gross growth efficiency of these ephyrae were 34.5% and 25.1%, respectively, significantly higher than at 6, 9.5 and 15 degrees C. Significant effects of salinity were shown for total ingestion, daily ration, daily growth rate and final weight, although only total ingestion and daily ration diverged sufficiently to show effects in a post-hoc test. This test showed that total ingestion was significantly different for all salinities except between 22 and 35 PSU and between 17.5 and 26 PSU. The daily ration for 35 PSU diverged from all other salinities, whereas none of the other salinities showed any significant differences. Thus, provided food in excess A. aurita can double its weight every 2 to 4 d, dependent on temperature and can therefore develop to the medusa stage in short time. Differences in environmental salinity in the range 17.5 to 35 PSU have little or no effect on growth rate and growth efficiency, whereas our results indicate that the full seawater salinity (35 PSU) causes significantly higher ingestion rate compared to lower salinities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,,,,,OCT,1999,135,1,,,,,89,98,,10.1007/s002270050605,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002270050605,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000083306400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

In an experimental study, we evaluated the timing of glochidia release by Unio crassus subjected to three spring water temperature regimes in the presence and absence of the host fish Cottus gobio. The timing of glochidia release was delayed at (i) constantly low temperatures (< 10A degrees C), in contrast to earlier and pronounced releases at (ii) natural temperature increases that level off at intermediate temperatures (10-15A degrees C), and (iii) higher-than-normal temperatures (10-20A degrees C). Mussels from treatment (i) that had not released glochidia during the experiment did so soon after being moved to the temperature in (ii), indicating a temperature threshold for glochidia release. Neither host fish presence nor the combined effect of temperature and host fish presence significantly affected the timing of glochidia release. The treatment with natural spring water temperatures indicated possible fitness benefits for U. crassus through combined effects of high intensities of glochidia releases and high survival of released glochidia.

Twenty Korean cattle steers (body weight = 356.5 +/- 3.72 kg, age = 16.8 +/- 0.34 months) were divided into two groups: 10 steers were fed a conventional concentrate (control), and 10 steers were fed a concentrate supplemented with 8 g/kg RPF (treatment). Steers were fed a concentrate at 1.6% body weight and 3 kg tall fescue hay daily for 12 weeks in 2016: January 8 to February 2 (P1), February 3 to March 3 (P2), and March 4 to April 1 (P3). Body weight was measured, and blood and rumen fluid were collected four times from each steer: at the start of the experiment, and then at 4-week intervals. The mean indoor temperatures during P1 ( - 7.37 degrees C) and P2 (-2.96 degrees C) were lower (P < 0.001) than the mean P3 temperature (6.22 degrees C). These lower temperatures were within the range that causes mild to moderate cold stress (CS) in other cattle breeds. By contrast, the mean indoor temperature during P3 is considered thermoneutral. The average daily gain (P = 0.39 and P = 0.16) and gain-to-feed ratio (P = 0.26 and P = 0.57) were not affected by RPF supplementation or time-period. Total dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber intakes per body weight were higher (all P < 0.001) in colder P1 or P2 compared to other time periods, but these variables were not affected (P >= 0.31) by RPF supplementation, except ether extract intake. Ruminal total VFA concentrations were higher (P = 0.001) in a colder January than in other months, but these were not affected (P = 0.26) by RPF supplementation.

RPF supplementation increased (P = 0.008) serum cholesterol concentrations. Our results indicate that mild to moderate CS may not affect Korean cattle, as cattle growth performance was not affected by colder temperatures, although concentrate and forage intakes were increased, and some changes in blood metabolic and ruminal parameters were observed.

Two experiments were carried out to assess the effect of storage temperature on in vitro sperm characteristics and 60-d nonreturn rate (NRR) following artificial insemination (AI) of liquid bovine semen. In experiment 1, the effect of storage of liquid bovine semen in INRA96 diluent (IMV Technologies, L'Aigle, France) at 1 of 5 storage temperatures (5, 15, or 28 degrees C, and fluctuating between 5 and 15 degrees C or 5 and 28 degrees C) on total and progressive motility and kinematic parameters was assessed objectively via computer-assisted sperm analyzer on d 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 after collection. Fluctuating temperatures were designed to mimic day- to nighttime variation. In experiment 2, we assessed the field fertility of liquid semen stored at a constant 5 or 15 degrees C or in an unregulated manner and compared with that of frozen-thawed semen (total of n = 106,738 inseminations). In experiment 1, we detected a linear decrease in motility with increased duration of storage. Semen stored at a constant 15 degrees C or fluctuating between 5 and 15 degrees C had greater total motility than semen held at 5 or 28 degrees C or fluctuating between 5 and 28 degrees C; however, semen stored at 15 degrees C and fluctuating between 5 and 15 degrees C did not differ from each other. Semen held at a constant 5 or 15 degrees C or fluctuating between 5 and 15 degrees C, although not differing from each other, had higher progressive motility scores than that held at 28 degrees C or fluctuating between 5 and 28 degrees C. Semen stored at a constant 28 degrees C exhibited poor motility and velocity values but had high progressive motion values compared with that all other storage temperatures; however, the other storage temperatures did riot differ from each other in relation to motility kinematics.

Both an increased frequency and intensity of extremes and changing amplitudes of diurnal temperature fluctuations may affect the fitness of species and the interactions between them. Such changing temperature regimes may affect reproductive success, population dynamics, species interactions and community structure. The present study compares the effects of an increased temperature regime with diurnal fluctuations with those of a constant temperature regime on the fitness and population dynamics of free-living marine nematodes and on their interspecific interactions. Microcosm experiments were performed on two congeneric monhysterid nematode species, which co-occur in their natural habitat, under a constant vs. an increased fluctuating temperature regime. The latter affected population dynamics of single species and altered the outcome of the interspecific interaction from a symmetrical to an asymmetrical inhibitory effect of D. meyli over D. oschei. Changes in the amplitude of diurnal temperature fluctuations as well as in the frequency of extreme temperatures may be very important determinants of the effects of temperature change on species interactions, potentially affecting assemblage structure and ecosystem functioning.

However, little attention has been paid to differences in plant type. The main objective of this study was to reveal the plant type characteristics associated with the high rice yield through the comparison of two sites: Taoyuan, Yunnan province and Nanjing, Jiangsu province, China. The physiological and environmental factors were also discussed. Field experiments were conducted at two sites in 2006 and 2007. Three Indica F-1 hybrid varieties, Eryou 107, Xieyou 107 and Eryouhang I in 2006, Eryou 107 and Xieyou 107 in 2007 were grown at two sites under optimum crop management to achieve maximum attainable yields. Leaf area, leaf length, leaf width, leaf angles, specific leaf weight (SLW) and specific leaf nitrogen (SLN) at heading, yield and yield components at maturity were determined. Daily radiation, air temperature and relative humidity (RH) were monitored. The highest yield of 18.5 t ha(-1) was achieved by Eryou 107 at Taoyuan in 2006, and average yield of all varieties at Taoyuan was 96% and 85% higher than Nanjing in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The higher yield at Taoyuan was attributed primarily to the larger sink size, which was mainly caused by the greater number of panicles per m(2). Biomass production was greater at Taoyuan than at Nanjing in 2006 and 2007, while differences in harvest index were very small. Compared with Nanjing, the rice planted in Taoyuan has greater leaf area index about 10 with smaller area per stem, shorter, wider and thicker leaves and smaller leaf angles. These results indicate that in addition to the higher biomass accumulation (main physiological factor) and the intense solar radiation with the large diurnal temperature range (main environmental factor), the greater leaf area index (LAI) with smaller area per stem, may be an important morphological factor contributing to the high yield in Taoyuan.

This research has been done on the dairy cow breed, specifically on the Holstein breed. However the results are easily extrapolated to the other dairy breeds. The experiment was focused on the embryos presented in the flushed liquid. All flushing out results were written down to the Excel MS and analyzed by the SPSS Statistics 17.0; exactly by the One-way ANOVA. The embryos obtained were found to fluctuate with the ambient temperature, being the lowest just during the high ambient temperature, high during the medium ambient temperature, high again at the time of the low ambient temperature during the heat phase of the cycle.

However, little is known regarding how temperature fluctuations, which can influence metabolic and cellular repair activity, affect survival outcomes in this species. For that reason, we designed three experiments to test the effects of intermittent warm-up periods and the degree of temperature fluctuation on winter-morphotype (WM) D. suzukii survival. We found that at 5 degrees C, a temperature sufficient to induce reproductive diapause, but warm enough to allow foraging, increasing warm-up frequency (warmed to 25 degrees C at various interval schedules) was associated with decreased survival. In contrast, when the nightly low temperature was 0 degrees C, daily fluctuations that warmed the environment to temperatures above freezing (5, or 15 degrees C) appeared beneficial and resulted in improved survival compared to flies held at 0 degrees C during day and night. When we next evaluated cold tolerance using a 24-hour stress test assay (-5 degrees C), we found that again, thermal fluctuations improved survival compared to static freezing conditions. However, we also found that WM D. suzukii exposed to freezing temperatures during acclimation were less cold tolerant, regardless of the thermal fluctuation schedule, indicating that there may be tradeoffs between adequate acclimation temperature, which is required to induce cold tolerance, and the ensuing effects of incidental chill injury. Moving forward, these data, which account for the nuanced interactions between the thermal environment and in the internal physiology of D. suzukii, may help refine seasonal populations models, which aim to forecast pest pressure based on conditions the previous winter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1910,1879-1611,,,,MAY-JUN,2021,131,,,,,,,,104246,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2021.104246,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2021.104246,,MAY 2021,,,,,,33930409,,,,,WOS:000655120700028,View Full Record in Web of Science

As global seawater temperatures rise, subtidal asteroids such as Echinaster (Othilia) graminicola on the Gulf Coast of Florida are increasingly subjected to elevated temperatures, which may compromise their neuromuscular health. To better understand the neuromuscular biology of E. graminicola and the effects of elevated seawater temperature on behavior, we first describe their righting mechanism and identify the arms used in righting and crawling. Together, this allowed us to determine if they exhibit any bilateral tendencies, related to their anterior-posterior ancestry, by measuring the frequency with which each arm led in righting and crawling. To determine the effect of elevated seawater temperature on their described righting behavior, we tested the effects of acute (1 day) and chronic (7 day) exposure to seawater temperatures ranging from 28 to 36 degrees C on righting time in a laboratory experiment. We found that E. graminicola rights by somersaulting, but exhibits no lead arm preference during this behavior. In crawling, Arm E, located adjacent to the madreporite, led most frequently, indicating a partial tendency toward bilateralism. Sea stars righted significantly faster with increasing temperature and exposure time as temperatures increased from 28 to 34 degrees C, suggesting some capacity for acclimatization to elevated temperatures. However, at 36 degrees C, righting time increased dramatically and sea stars experienced high mortality, suggesting E. graminicola may be living near the upper limits of its thermotolerance. As seawater temperatures rise beyond an organism's thermal tolerance, their neuromuscular responses may become critically impaired, reducing their capacity to survive in a warming ocean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,NOV,2019,166,11,,,,,,,138,10.1007/s00227-019-3591-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-019-3591-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000488389600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main aim of this study was to determine the effect of temperature on this important threshold DO, and secondly, to provide aquaculturists with a model that estimates feed intake as function of both temperature and DO. Quadruple tank groups of Atlantic salmon post-smolts (similar to 0.3-0.5 kg) were kept at 7, 11, 15 and 19 degrees C, and subjected to seven DO levels per temperature, ranging from approximate to 32-92, 42-102, 52-112 and 62-122% O-2, respectively, for 42 days. DO levels were changed every second day, in random order. Fish were fed a known amount of feed in excess twice daily, waste feed was collected and daily feed intake (DFI, % of biomass, BM, per day) estimated. The routine oxygen consumption rate (MO2 rout, measured in partially fasted and active fish) and the DO below which MO2 rout started to decline (termed the routine limiting oxygen saturation, LOSrout) was determined in fasted fish at all four temperatures at the end of experimentation, and the latter was used to estimate the zero feed intake DO in the DFI model. The data demonstrate sustained appetite with decreasing DO until a threshold level (DOmaxFI) is reached, at which point appetite gradually decreases. Both the maximal level of feed intake (DFImax) and the DOmaxFI were highly dependent on temperature, increasing from 0.47 to 0.88% of BM/day, and from 42 to 76% O-2, respectively, within the temperature range tested. The LOSrout ranged from 24 to 40% O-2. The present study is the first to present the pronounced effect of temperature on DOmaxFI, and results suggest that the DO requirement of A. salmon has previously been considerably over-estimated, particularly at lower temperatures.

Isolated embryos from both Varieties germinated well in water irrespective of the thermal regime of incubation. However, the ability of ABA to block germination in Redland B2 (sprouting-susceptible) isolated embryos was significantly reduced when embryos were incubated under fluctuating temperatures from 23 DAP onwards. No such effect was found in IS 9530 (sprouting-resistant) embryos. No differences in the pattern with which embryonic ABA content decreased during whole grain incubation were found in 25 and 35 DAP grains from both varieties incubated under constant or fluctuating temperatures. Therefore, these results indicate that alternating temperatures can promote germination through different mechanisms. One of them is the decrease in embryo sensitivity to ABA inhibition which appears to be acting in Redland B2 caryopses from 23 DAP onwards; the other one seems to be independent of ABA level and sensitivity and is active at very early stages of development in one variety (Redland B2) and throughout seed development in the other (IS 9530).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,,,,,JUN,1995,46,287,,,,,711,717,,10.1093/jxb/46.6.711,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/46.6.711,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995RE94500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, the same parameters were determined on Golden Delicious leaves at three constant temperatures (20, 30 and 35 degreesC, 65 +/- 10% RH and 16: 8 L: D) in the laboratory. A. viennensis showed a better performance on Golden Delicious than on the other apple cultivars. This was mainly due to a short development time (10.7 days), high daily egg production (5.2 eggs/female/day) and early reproduction peak. The highest intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) was determined on the variety Golden Delicious (r(m) = 0.247/day), while the lowest one was observed on the variety Starking Delicious (r(m) = 0.215/day). The developmental periods of A. viennensis varied from 7.4 to 18.8 days at 35 and 20 degreesC for females, while it varied from 7.9 to 17.2 days at 30 and 20 degreesC for males. The development threshold of the eggs and pre-adult stages were 9.72 and 9.07 degreesC, total effective temperature was 72.99 and 185.18 degree days, respectively.

Temperature fluctuation is a general phenomenon affecting many, if not all, species in nature. While a few studies have shown that temperature fluctuation can promote species coexistence, little is known about the effects of different regimes of temperature fluctuation on coexistence. 2. We experimentally investigated how temperature fluctuation and different regimes of temperature fluctuation ('red' environments in which temperature series exhibited positive temporal autocorrelation vs. 'white' environments in which temperature series showed little autocorrelation) affected the coexistence of two ciliated protists, Colpidium striatum Stein and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn, which competed for bacterial resources. 3. We have previously shown that the two species differed in their growth responses to changes in temperature and in their resource utilization patterns. The two species were not always able to coexist at constant temperatures (22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 degrees C), with Paramecium being competitively excluded at 26 and 28 degrees C. This indicated that resource partitioning was insufficient to maintain coexistence at these temperatures. 4. Here we show that in both red and white environments in which temperature varied between 22 and 32 degrees C, Paramecium coexisted with Colpidium. Consistent with the differential effects of temperature on their intrinsic growth rates, Paramecium population dynamics were largely unaffected by temperature regimes, and Colpidium showed more variable population dynamics in the red environments. 5. Temperature-dependent competitive effects of Colpidium on Paramecium, together with resource partitioning, appeared to be responsible for the coexistence in the white environments; resource partitioning and the storage effect appeared to account for the coexistence in the red environments. 6. These results suggest that temperature fluctuation may play important roles in regulating species coexistence and diversity in ecological communities.",,,,,"Jiang, Lin/K-5572-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JUL,2007,76,4,,,,,660,668,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01252.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01252.x,,,,,,,,17584371,,,,,WOS:000247398800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A three-dimensional circulation model Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) with a built-in air-sea heat flux exchange module Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Experiment (COARE) was coupled with a spectral wave model Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) to resolve the surface heat exchange and wave-driven reef circulation in Coral Bay, Ningaloo Reef. Using realistic oceanic and atmospheric forcing, the model predictions were in good agreement with measured time series of water temperature at various locations in the coral reef system during the bleaching event. Through a series of sensitivity analyses, we found that the difference in temperature between the reef and surrounding offshore waters (T) was predominantly a function of both the daily mean net heat flux ((Q(net)) over bar) and residence time, whereas diurnal variations in reef water temperature were dependent on the diurnal fluctuation in the net heat flux. We found that reef temperatures were substantially higher than offshore in the inner lagoon under normal weather conditions and over the entire reef domain under more extreme weather conditions (0.7 degrees C-1.5 degrees C). Although these temperature elevations were still less than that caused by the regional ocean warming (2 degrees C-3 degrees C), the arrival of peak seasonal temperatures in the summer of 2010-2011 (when net atmospheric heat fluxes were positive and abnormally high) caused substantially higher thermal stresses than would have otherwise occurred if offshore temperatures had reached their normal seasonal maxima in autumn (when net atmospheric heat fluxes were negative or cooling). Therefore, the degree heating weeks calculated based on offshore temperature substantially underestimated the thermal stresses experienced by the reef in the period leading up to the observed bleaching event (3 versus 11 degrees C-weeks).",,,,,"Lowe, Ryan/A-5032-2012; Ivey, Gregory N/K-5299-2012; McCulloch, Malcolm Thomas/C-3651-2009","Lowe, Ryan/0000-0002-7080-8406; Ivey, Gregory N/0000-0003-2469-2470; McCulloch, Malcolm Thomas/0000-0003-1538-1558",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,SEP,2013,118,9,,,,,4600,4616,,10.1002/jgrc.20338,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgrc.20338,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000326230200040,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature significantly (P < 0.01) affected the percentage of cuttings that produced microtubers. The highest temperatures in either phase resulted in the lowest percentage of cuttings that produced microtubers. With lower temperature during either phase, we found more microtubers per cutting and larger microtuber sizes. The effects of temperature on individual microtuber weight were not statistically significant. However, increasing the temperature during different thermophases increased both length and weight of sprouts formed on the microtubers. Moreover, the highest temperatures resulted in the lowest levels of tuberization (as shown by bud status) and the largest sprout growth. The temperature amplitude had a significant effect as well: very large temperature amplitudes resulted in poorer tuber formation compared with smaller temperature amplitudes with the same average temperature. All three cultivars showed different responses with regard to the percentage of explants that produced microtubers. After 45 days of incubation, the percentage of explants producing microtubers, the number of microtubers and the length of the sprouts were significantly increased compared with 35 days of incubation.

We tested the effects of temperature variability during development on male fitness in the rainforest fly Drosophila birchii, by simulating thermal variation typical of the warm and cool margins of its elevational distribution, and estimated heritabilities and genetic correlations of fitness traits. Reproductive success was reduced for males reared in warm (mean 24 degrees C) fluctuating (+/- 3 degrees C) vs. constant conditions but not in cool fluctuating conditions (mean 17 degrees C), although fluctuations reduced body size at both temperatures. Male reproductive success under warm fluctuating conditions was similar to that at constant 27 degrees C, indicating that briefly exceeding critical thermal limits has similar fitness costs to continuously stressful conditions. There was substantial heritable variation in all traits. However, reproductive success traits showed no genetic correlation between treatments reflecting temperature variation at elevational extremes, which may constrain evolutionary responses at these ecological margins.

To gain a better understanding of the impact of fluctuating temperatures, we investigated the effects of increased temperature variation on Phanaeus vindex dung beetles across levels of biological organization. Specifically, we hypothesized that increased temperature variation is energetically demanding. We predicted that thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate and energetic reserves would be reduced with increasing fluctuation. To test this, we examined the responses of dung beetles to constant (20 degrees C), low fluctuation (20 +/- 5 degrees C), or high fluctuation (20 +/- 12 degrees C) temperature treatments using respirometry, assessment of energetic reserves and HPLC-MS-based metabolomics. We found no significant differences in metabolic rate or energetic reserves, suggesting increased fluctuations were not energetically demanding. To understand why there was no effect of increased amplitude of temperature fluctuation on energetics, we assembled and annotated a de novo transcriptome, finding non-overlapping transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of beetles exposed to different fluctuations. We found that 58 metabolites increased in abundance in both fluctuation treatments, but 15 only did so in response to high-amplitude fluctuations. We found that 120 transcripts were significantly upregulated following acclimation to any fluctuation, but 174 were upregulated only in beetles from the high-amplitude fluctuation treatment. Several differentially expressed transcripts were associated with post-translational modifications to histones that support a more open chromatin structure. Our results demonstrate that acclimation to different temperature fluctuations is distinct and may be supported by increasing transcriptional plasticity. Our results indicate for the first time that histone modifications may underlie rapid acclimation to temperature variation.",,,,,"Marshall, Katie/AFK-5175-2022","Padash Barmchi, Mojgan/0000-0003-1505-8953; Marshall, Katie/0000-0002-6991-4957; Sheldon, Kimberly/0000-0002-3215-2223",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,DEC,2020,223,23,,,,,,,jeb233239,10.1242/jeb.233239,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.233239,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000599460900018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Reproduction periods did not differ among temperatures, but at 25 and 30 degrees C more nymphs were produced (65.9 and 69.8 nymphs/female, respectively) than at 20 degrees C (59,9 nymphs/female) because of a higher daily reproduction.

Though eukaryotes show some similarity in the composition and dynamics of their splicing machinery, observations of unique plant traits are only starting to emerge. For instance, plant alternative splicing is closely linked to their ability to perceive various environmental stimuli. Due to their sessile lifestyle, temperature is a central source of information, allowing plants to adjust their development to match current growth conditions. Hence, seasonal temperature fluctuations and day-night cycles can strongly influence plant morphology across developmental stages. Here we discuss available data on temperature-dependent alternative splicing in plants. Given its fragmented state, it is not always possible to fit specific observations into a coherent picture, yet it is sufficient to estimate the complexity of this field and the need for further research.

Gastric evacuation times, measured experimentally, were faster for fish fed continuously (0.8-1.8 h) than for fish fed single meals of zooplankton (4.0-7.2 h) and were influenced by fish size. In Oneida Lake, young gizzard shad exhibited a diel feeding cycle; gut fullness gradually increased to a maximum during 1100-1900 hours and declined during the night. Juvenile gizzard shad shifted from a diet of exclusively zooplankton in July to a combination of zooplankton, algae, and detritus in August. Estimates of total daily ration ranged from 1.2 to 21.3% of wet body weight, and total daily ration of young gizzard shad increased with fish size. Our estimates of daily ration, based on fish feeding continuously during the day and digesting a single meal at night, closely approximated the maximum daily field ration of age-0 gizzard shad in Oneida Lake. The Daphnia population in Oneida Lake collapsed during July 1991, and Daphnia consumption by gizzard shad dropped sharply with it; from dietary considerations, the collapse could have been caused by a density of approximately 300,000 age-0 gizzard shad per hectare. In 1992, Daphnia production remained strong during July and August, and Daphnia consumption by gizzard shad did not decline. Because young gizzard shad can switch from zooplankton to phytoplankton as an alternative food source, we hypothesize that gizzard shad have a greater influence on growth and survival of age-0 yellow perch Perca flavescens than yellow perch have on gizzard shad, because yellow perch rely more on Daphnia as a primary food.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8487,,,,,MAY,1996,125,3,,,,,411,421,,10.1577/1548-8659(1996)125<0411:DFDFIA>2.3.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1996)125<0411:DFDFIA>2.3.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UK98000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

L.; Alanara, A.",,,The energy requirements of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) in intensive culture,AQUACULTURE NUTRITION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fish feed constitutes one of the largest costs in aquaculture, therefore inefficient feed management will have a negative impact on fish farm economics. Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) is a relatively new candidate for freshwater aquaculture, however little is known about the energy requirements of this species. The aim of this study was to develop an energy requirement model for intensive culture of Eurasian perch reared at rational temperatures. Data on growth (the thermal unit growth coefficient, TGC, (3)root g . (degrees C . days)(-1)) and digestible energy need (DEN, kJ DE . g(-1)) of Eurasian perch at a size range of 20-180 g and at temperatures of 17 23 degrees C were used. Regression analysis revealed that both TGC and DEN were affected significantly by fish size (P < 0.001) but not by temperature (P > 0.05). Two models including body size of the fish were developed: (i) an inverse TGC model for evaluation of the daily theoretical weight increment (TWi, g . day(-1)) and (ii) a linear DEN model. The TGC model was validated by comparing theoretical data with data obtained from a commercial growth trial. By combining the TWi and the DEN, a model describing the daily theoretical energy requirement (TER, kJ . day(-1)) at different temperatures and for Eurasian perch of different sizes was successfully developed.",,,,,"Strand, Åsa/L-7270-2013","Strand, Åsa/0000-0002-9029-4123",,,,,,,,,,,,,1353-5773,1365-2095,,,,AUG,2011,17,4,,,,,E818,E824,,10.1111/j.1365-2095.2010.00838.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2095.2010.00838.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000292521000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

When oxygen demand exceeds oxygen availability, animals may experience functional hypoxia regardless of environmental oxygen levels. In the current study, we aimed to assess if oxidative or thermal restrictions exist when winter-acclimated Haliotis midae juveniles are re-acclimated to temperatures within their thermal tolerance range, but with one temperature outside the average daily temperatures they would experience in winter. At each acclimation temperature (14, 16 and 19 degrees C), we also manipulated dissolved oxygen levels to obtain oxygen saturation levels of 82%, 98% and 126%. Our results indicate growth restrictions and hypometabolism at all oxygen treatments at 19 degrees C. Efficiency of mitochondrial respiration, as indicated by an increase in cytochrome c oxidase subunits 1 and 2 (cox1 and cox2) transcript level, was improved at 19 degrees C, 98% oxygen. A change in substrate utilisation, from a glycogen/lipid-driven metabolism to almost exclusively protein-driven metabolism provided the fuel for more effective cellular respiration. A further decrease in metabolic rate at 19 degrees C, 126% oxygen, this time without an increase in cox1 and cox2 transcripts, may indicate some improvement in gas exchange, but without improvement in growth. We propose that 19 degrees C is nearing a long-term limiting temperature for winter-acclimated SA abalone, and that animals survive this condition by re-allocating available energy to survival mechanisms instead of growth.

While an organism's response to high temperature stress clearly depends on current thermal conditions, its response may also be affected by the temporal pattern and duration of past temperature exposures. We used RNA sequencing of Manduca sexta larvae fat body tissue to evaluate how diurnal temperature fluctuations during development affected gene expression both independently and in conjunction with subsequent heat stress. Additionally, we compared gene expression between two M. sexta populations, a lab colony and a genetically related field population that have been separated for >300 generations and differ in their thermal sensitivities. Lab-adapted larvae were predicted to show increased expression responses to both single and repeated thermal stress, whereas recurrent exposure could decrease later stress responses for field individuals. We found large differences in overall gene expression patterns between the two populations across all treatments, as well as population-specific transcriptomic responses to temperature; more differentially expressed genes were upregulated in the field compared with lab larvae. Developmental temperature fluctuations alone had minimal effects on long-term gene expression patterns, with the exception of a somewhat elevated stress response in the lab population. Fluctuating rearing conditions did alter gene expression during exposure to later heat stress, but this effect depended on both the population and the particular temperature conditions.

The first objective of this work was to test ALARM against lysimeter ET data. The second objective was to compare the performance of ALARM with Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), the most widely used model for estimating ET from remotely sensed data. An experiment was conducted on a 1.5ha potato field in the Jordan Valley that has a weighing lysimeter located midfield. Potatoes were planted on the January 14, 2016, and harvested on the May 10, 2016. Three images from Landsat 8 were used to compute ALARM and SEBAL ET. The measured daily ET of the potatoes ranged from 5mmd-1 on March 22 to 7.5mmd-1 on April 23. ALARM underestimated the daily measured ET by 8% on March 22, 16% on April 7 and 33% on April 23 while SEBAL underestimated the daily measured ET by 4% on March 22, 15% on April 7 and 37% on April 23.

To obtain variations in partitioning, continuous collection of gaseous dicarbonyls was performed using a parallel plate wet denuder, and at the same time, the dicarbonyls in particle were collected using a spray-type particle collector downstream. Hourly samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. This method is advantageous to monitor the gaseous and particulate carbonyls separately without loss during sampling. Sampling was performed in summer and winter in a midsize city (Kumamoto, Japan). The concentrations of the dicarbonyls increased in the summer daytime, which suggests that they are mostly formed by secondary production in the local atmosphere. The dicarbonyls and formaldehyde (HCHO) were found in both gas and particle phases, and partitioning to the particle phase was highest for Gly, followed by Mgly and HCHO. It was observed that the compounds moved to the particle phase in the midnight and early morning hours according to the growth of hygroscopic aerosols in summer. The particle/gas ratio also increased in the presence of high PM2.5, which is transported from the Chinese Continent in winter. The dicarbonyls were also observed on Mt. Fuji (3776 m) in the free troposphere. From back trajectory data and information on volatile organic compounds, they were most likely produced from relatively long-lifetime organic compounds from the Chinese Continent and biogenic volatile organic compounds emitted in the Japan Alps mountain range. Higher particle/gas ratios at the Mt. Fuji station indicate that low temperatures and high humidity precede the partition. The estimated effective Henry's law constants for the dicarbonyls, 108 order in mol/kgH(2)O/atm for summer data, were much higher than those for ideal liquid/vapor equilibrium but close to reported results obtained by chamber experiments. In the proposed method, oligomers in particle were also counted as the compounds. The dicarbonyl compounds existed up to submolar levels in real atmospheric aerosols, which suggests they undergo further reactions in the particle phase.",,,,,"Ohira, Shin-Ichi Ohira/AAN-5628-2020","Toda, Kei/0000-0001-6577-1752; Ohira, Shin-Ichi/0000-0002-5958-339X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2472-3452,,,,,SEP,2018,2,9,,,,,915,924,,10.1021/acsearthspacechem.8b00037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsearthspacechem.8b00037,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000445711600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature was kept either continuously at 27 degrees C or switched from 27 degrees C to 33 degrees C at 12 h post inoculation (hpi) and maintained at that temperature for 6 h (6 h 33 degrees C), 12 h (12 h 33 degrees C), 18 h (18 h 33 degrees C) or 24 h (24 h 33 degrees C) per day. Temperature was then lowered and maintained at 27 degrees C for the remaining hours of the day. The experiments ran for 132 hpi with WSSV Thai-1 and 168-192 hpi with WSSV Viet. WSSV infections were demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). Shrimp kept continuously at 27 degrees C, started to show clinical signs at 24 hpi and mortalities started at 36 hpi with both strains. Cumulative mortalities reached 100% at 60 hpi with WSSV Thai-1 and at 168-192 hpi with WSSV Viet in two experiments. At constant 33 degrees C (24 h 33 degrees C), mortalities were 0% with WSSV Thai-1 and 5% or 10% with WSSV Viet. With exposure to 33 degrees C for 6 or 12 h per day (6 h 33 degrees C or 12 h 33 degrees C), cumulative mortalities reached 90-100% at 72-96 hpi with WSSV Thai-1. With WSSV Viet cumulative mortalities reached 100% at 84-96 hpi or 50-95% at 96-108 hpi with 33 degrees C for 6 h or 12 h per day.

The experiment was stopped at 19.1 degrees C, with 26.7% of the fish surviving to this point. Plasma glucose levels increased slightly at 16 and 18 degrees C (by 1.39- and 1.74-fold, respectively), in contrast, cortisol levels were elevated significantly (by 2.9-fold) at 16 degrees C but returned to control Levels thereafter. The effect of increasing temperature on the expression of immune related genes in blood cells (leukocytes) was variable and depended on the gene of interest. The expression of IgM-H remained stable for the duration of the experiment. In contrast, IL-1 beta expression was increased significantly (by -25-fold) at 19 degrees C as compared to time-matched control fish, and changes in the expression of beta(2)-M, MHC Class I and IgM-L followed a pattern similar to that seen for cortisol: increasing at 16 degrees C (by 4.2- 5.3- and 17-fold, respectively), but returning to pre-stress levels by 19 degrees C. Interestingly, increasing temperatures had no effect on respiratory burst activity. This study is the first to examine the effects of a chronic regimen of increasing temperature on the stress physiology and immunology of a marine teleost, and suggests that immune function is influenced by complex interactions between thermal effects and temperature-induced stress (elevated circulating cortisol levels).

Day-neutral cultivars such as 'Seascape' are adaptable to a range of photoperiods, including short days that would save considerable energy for crop lighting without reductions in productivity or yield. Since photoperiod and temperature interact to affect strawberry growth and development, several diurnal temperature regimes were tested under a short photoperiod of 10 h per day for effects on yield and quality attributes of 'Seascape' strawberry during production cycles longer than 270 days. The coolest day/night temperature regime, 16 degrees/8 degrees C, tended to produce smaller numbers of larger fruit than did the intermediate temperature range of 18 degrees/10 degrees C or the warmest regime, 20 degrees/12 degrees C, both of which produced similar larger numbers of smaller fruit. The intermediate temperature regime produced the highest total fresh mass of berries over an entire production cycle. Independent experiments examined either organoleptic or physicochemical quality attributes. Organoleptic evaluation indicated that fruit grown under the coolest temperature regime tended to score the highest for both hedonic preference and descriptive evaluation of sensory attributes related to sweetness, texture, aftertaste, and overall approval. The physicochemical quality attributes Brix, pH, and sugar/acid ratio were highest for fruits harvested from the coolest temperature regime and lower for those from the warmer temperature regimes. The cool-regime fruits also were lowest in titratable acidity. The yield parameters fruit number and size oscillated over the course of a production cycle, with a gradual decline in fruit size under all three temperature regimes. Brix and titratable acidity both decreased over time for all three temperature treatments, but sugar/acid ratio remained highest for the cool temperature regime over the entire production period. Periodic rejuvenation or replacement of strawberry propagules may be needed to maintain both quality and quantity of strawberry yield in space.

An understanding of the seed germination ecology of Coolatai grass can assist in predicting its potential distribution and developing effective management strategies. The effects of various environmental factors on Coolatai grass seed germination were investigated in a series of laboratory experiments. The effect of diurnal alternating temperatures (5-45 C) with a 12-h photoperiod were examined on a thermogradient plate. Seed germination occurred at almost all temperature combinations from 5 to 45 C. At moderate temperatures the speed of seed germination was very high; at 30/20 C more than 80% of seeds were germinated within 12 h. Germination was slightly enhanced by the presence of light, but length of photoperiod did not affect germination. Germination at neutral pH was over 90%, and declined to 65% at acidic (pH 4) and alkaline (pH 10) pH levels. Germination was completely inhibited at an osmotic stress of -0.55 MPa or greater and was reduced by 50% at -0.37 MPa. Greater germination in relatively dry soil conditions compared with native species may contribute to the establishment of this species in the field. Results indicate that Coolatai grass seeds can germinate over a wide range of diurnal temperatures, light regimes, pH levels, and under marginal water stress. These characteristics help explain the successful invasion of Coolatai grass and provide evidence that this species is capable of establishing in many parts of Australia.",,,,,"Kristiansen, Paul/X-6638-2019; Whalley, Ralph/F-9610-2018","Kristiansen, Paul/0000-0003-2116-0663; Whalley, Ralph/0000-0002-2949-9891; Sindel, Brian/0000-0002-4100-218X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1745,1550-2759,,,,JUL-AUG,2008,56,4,,,,,543,548,,10.1614/WS-07-163.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WS-07-163.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000257452600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hypotheses: White light and temperature fluctuations will promote the germination ofM. alejandrae and seeds from site with higher humidity will have increased germination percentage. Study species: Magnolia alejandrae. Study sites and dates: El Farallon in the Jaumave municipality and Los San Pedros in the Guemez municipality, Tamaulipas, Mexico. May-June 2019. Methods: Four light-quality treatments (white, red, far-red and darkness) were evaluated, along with two temperature treatments: constant (18/18 C) and fluctuating temperatures (8/18 C) and two populations (El Farallon and Los San Pedros) on the germination ofM. alejandrae. We used twenty seeds of the study species per experimental unit with five repetitions for each treatment. Results: Light quality influenced the germination of M. alejandrae seeds, having the highest germination (76 %) under white light, followed by 45 % under red light, 9 % under far-red and 5 % in darkness, demonstrating that the seeds of this species are neutral photoblastic.

Conventional data sets are derived from weather stations; however, in many cases there are no weather stations sufficiently close to a basin to be representative of climate conditions in that basin. In addition, it is often the case either that the period of record for the weather station(s) does not cover the period of the proposed simulation or that there are gaps in the data. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to investigate alternative climate data sources for use in hydrological modelling and to develop a protocol for creating hydrological data sets that are spatially and temporally harmonized. The methods we used for constructing daily, spatially distributed, climatic data sets of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, potential evapotranspiration, and relative humidity are described. The model used in this study was the Soil and Water Assessment Tool implemented on the Mimbres River Basin located in southwestern New Mexico, USA, for the period 2003-2006.

Five shark pups were tracked using a specially designed acoustic tail beat transmitter. Previous laboratory experiments determined that tail beat frequency (TBF) and water temperature could be used as predictors of instantaneous swimming speed (0 and oxygen consumption rates (Vo(2)). Sharks carrying transmitters had higher cost of transport than uninstrumented sharks, but because the difference was quantifiable, appropriate corrections could be made for transmitter effects on energy consumption of instrumented sharks. Sharks tracked in Kane'ohe Bay had an overall average TBF of 70 +/- 10 beats min (-1) and a U of 0.81 +/- 0.1 body lengths s (-1), but swam significantly faster at night than during the day. These sharks also exhibited high average metabolic rates (MR) (96 +/- 15 U kg (-1) day (-1)) compared with other species of sharks previously studied. Sharks tracked during warmer summer months swam slightly faster and exhibited higher MR than one tracked in December. The high MR measured for sharks in the bay indicate that these sharks require a high daily ration. The relatively low caloric value of the most common prey (snapping shrimp, Alpheus malabaricus) suggests that high numbers must be consumed to meet the sharks' daily requirements. Low and/or negative growth rates of shark pups in the field and declining population size over the summer season suggests that a significant percentage of pups in Kane'ohe Bay may starve as the result of their high MR requirements. Although availability of A. malabaricus may not be limiting in Kane'ohe Bay, foraging skills of some neonates may be inadequate to enable them to meet their daily energetic needs. However, sharks that are successful in surviving through the winter may actually grow faster in the colder months due to the temperature dependent decrease of their MR and a reduction in conspecific competition as the result of high summer seasonal attrition due to starvation and emigration.

Individuals with superior thermoregulatory abilities may either maintain higher body temperatures, and thereby enjoy increased performance, or they may decrease time spent basking, and thereby reduce the potential costs, e.g. predation, associated with thermoregulation. In a comparison of thermoregulatory capacity, daily body temperature, and proportion of time exposed between melanistic and zigzag individuals in a population of Vipera berus polymorphic for colour pattern, melanistic individuals were found to heat faster and to reach slightly higher body temperatures than did zigzag individuals when experimentally exposed to identical environmental conditions. However, there was no consistent difference in daily body temperature variation or in exposure between radiotelemetered free ranging melanistic and zigzag individuals, despite the fact that snake body temperatures appeared to be constrained by the physical environment for most of the study period.

A third-order neuron, DNI, converts graded potentials into axonal spikes that have been shown in experiments at room temperature to be sparse and precisely timed. I investigated effects of temperature changes that a locust normally experiences on these signals. With increased temperature, response latency decreases and frequency responses of the neurons increase. Both the graded potential responses in the two types of neuron and the spikes in DNI report greater detail about a fluctuating light stimulus. Over a rise from 22 to 35 degrees C the power spectrum of the L-neuron response encompasses higher frequencies and its information capacity increases from about 600 to 1,700 bits/s. DNI generates spikes more often during a repeated stimulus but at all temperatures it reports rapid decreases in light rather than providing a continual measure of light intensity. Information rate carried by spike trains increases from about 50 to 185 bits/s. At warmer temperatures, increased performance by ocellar interneurons may contribute to improved aerobatic performance by delivering spikes earlier and in response to smaller, faster light stimuli.",,,,,,"Simmons, Peter/0000-0002-1630-5082",,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-7594,,,,,NOV,2011,197,11,,,,,1083,1096,,10.1007/s00359-011-0669-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-011-0669-y,,,,,,,,21830121,,,,,WOS:000298627200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evaluating the behaviour of coral reef associated fish species at different temperatures can help to assess their sensitivity to climate change. In this study, the speed of freely swimming fish in a natural setting is investigated as a function of seasonal changes in water temperature, as contrasted with systematic temperature increases in a fish tank. We show that Dascyllus reticulatus swim faster as a function of increased water temperature over the range 20.9-30.3 degrees C. The experiments were carried out using similar to 3.6 million fish trajectories observed at the Kenting National Park in Taiwan. Fish speed was computed by detecting and tracking the fish through consecutive video frames, then converting image speeds to scene speeds. Temperatures were grouped into 10 intervals. The data reveal an similar to 2 mm s(-1) increase in average speed per additional temperature degree over the range of 20.9-30.3 degrees C. The Mann-Kendall test using the mean and median speed for each interval revealed that there is a speed increase trend as temperature increases at the 0.05 significance level, rather than a random increase.

Three codend types were tested: a 120 mm diamond mesh codend, a Danish type 105 mm escape window codend, and a 105 mm square mesh top-panel codend (Bacoma-window). In total, 30 tows were carried out in three different experiments. Mean tow duration was 3 h and average codend catch 536 kg (range 47-2592 kg). Escapees were collected during the last 20 min of each haul by a caging method. These fish were then held in cages anchored on the seabed and checked daily by divers. Average number of escapees in cage was 133. Average caging duration was 9.5 days. The mortality of escapees was low in normal water temperatures (<10 degreesC) in all codend types. Higher mortalities were observed when cages were held in temperatures above 15 degreesC. The majority of these deaths occurred during the first day after the tow. Apparently, these fish experienced strong thermal stress when they were towed to the cage release site through the thermal stratification layer. In commercial trawling the tow is usually not directed to shallow waters. A somewhat higher mortality was predicted for larger fish that escaped from the 120 mm diamond mesh codend while in the 105 mm escape window codend the effect was reverse. In the Bacoma-window codend the number of dead escapees was very low in all length groups. We did not find any clear difference in skin injury between the three codend types. The predicted escape mortality was somewhat higher with higher codend catches. We conclude that the mortality of Baltic cod codend escapees is low in the normal water temperature (3-9 degreesC).

It has been proposed that the resulting rapid freeze-thaw cycles (freezing stress) cause a type of winter injury in montane red spruce that is characterized by necrosis of sun-exposed foliage. In autumn and winter, we monitored rapid freezing stress response of needle sections from 10 montane red spruce trees by subjecting needles to rapid freezing over the temperature span typically recorded in the field. In autumn, experimental rapid freezing stress produced severe injury only at temperatures considerably lower than expected for that time of year. In winter, rapid freezing caused occasional, moderate injury in fully hardened foliage of trees susceptible to both slow and rapid freezing. Seasonal changes insensitivity to rapid and slow freezing were correlated, suggesting that environmental factors that are known to affect sensitivity to slow freezing may also affect sensitivity to rapid freezing. Experimental manipulation of the start and end temperatures of rapid freezing stress events showed that moderate to severe needle injury can occur in susceptible trees at temperature spans slightly more extreme than those typically recorded in the field. The extent of injury was similar at different starting temperatures if rapid freezing occurred over the same temperature span. Year-old foliage was consistently less sensitive to rapid freezing stress than current-year foliage, but some year-old foliage was damaged when the rapid freezing stress regime caused severe injury in current-year foliage. We conclude that rapid freeze-thaw cycles can explain light to moderate injury of current-year foliage, but they do not explain the more severe and widespread pattern of foliar damage that has occurred intermittently over at least the last 18 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,FEB,2000,20,3,,,,,187,194,,,,,,,,,,,12651471,,,,,WOS:000085664900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, thermal plasticity is rarely studied in response to thermal variability and is often measured in a single life stage. Plasticity in response to thermal variability likely differs from responses to constant temperature or acute stress. In addition, life stages likely differ in their plasticity, and responses in one stage may be affected by the experiences in a previous stage. Increasing the resolution with which we understand thermal plasticity in response to thermal variation across ontogeny is crucial to understanding how organisms cope with the thermal variation in their environment and to estimating the capacity of plasticity to mitigate costs of rapid environmental change. We wanted to know whether life stages differ in their capacity for thermal plasticity under temperature fluctuations. We reared Onthophagus taurus dung beetles in either low or high temperature fluctuation treatments and quantified thermal plasticity of metabolism of pupae and adults. We found that adults were thermally plastic and pupae were not. Next, we tested whether the plasticity observed in the adult life stage was affected by the thermal conditions during development. We again used low and high temperature fluctuation treatments and reared individuals in one condition through all egg to pupal stages. At eclosion, we switched half of the individuals in each treatment to the opposite fluctuation condition and, later, measured thermal plasticity of metabolism in adults. We found that temperature conditions experienced during the adult stage, but not egg to pupal stages, affect adult thermal plasticity. However, temperature fluctuations during development affect adult body size, suggesting that some aspects of the adult phenotype are decoupled from previous life stages and others are not. Our data demonstrate that life stages mount different responses to temperature variability and uniquely contribute to the adult phenotype. These findings emphasize the need to broadly integrate the life cycle into studies of phenotypic plasticity and physiology; doing so should enhance our ability to predict organismal responses to rapid global change and inform conservation efforts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,OCT,2020,223,20,,,,,,,jeb227884,10.1242/jeb.227884,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.227884,,,,,,,,32917819,,,,,WOS:000589086900012,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, PM also has many drawbacks, such as producing plastic film residues and causing high temperatures at later crop growth stages. Thus, biodegradable film mulching (BM) has recently been used as an excellent alternative solution. In this study, the effects of three mulching types, including PM, BM, and NM, on soil temperatures (Ts) are evaluated using field experiments. Three mulching types with an irrigation depth of 22.5 mm (i.e., PM22.5, BM22.5, and NM22.5) and three irrigation depths of 15, 22.5, and 30 mm with BM (i.e., BM15, BM22.5, and BM30, respectively) were compared. Additionally, the Ts fluctuations and distributions during different crop growth stages were simulated using HYDRUS (2D/3D). The results showed that HYDRUS (2D/3D) successfully simulated Ts with RMSE of 2.11-4.00 degrees C, EF of 0.63-0.85, and MRE of 8.1 %-11.6 % during the validation period. There were large differences in Ts among PM22.5, BM22.5, and NM22.5 in different crop growth stages. In the elongation and tasseling stages, Ts under PM(22.5 )and BM(22.5)was not significantly different but markedly improved compared with NM22.5 In the filling and maturation stages, higher variability of Ts was observed under BM(22.5)compared with PM22.5 The standard deviation (SD), the deviation variance (DV), and the kurtosis coefficient (K) under BM(22.5 )were by 6.7 %, 32.6 %, and 19.3 % higher than under PM22.5, while accumulated soil temperature (AT) and the ratio of effective accumulated soil temperature (AET, >10 degrees C) to AT (RT) decreased by 3.8 % and 4.0 %, respectively. Additionally, apparent differences in T-s between BM22.5 and PM(22.5 )appeared mainly in the soil surface layer (0-10 cm). The area with optimal T-s (i.e., corn growth is optimal in the T-s range of 20-24 degrees C) in the 0-30 cm soil layer increased by 33.5 % under BM22.5 compared with PM22.5. Moreover, T-s decreased with an increase in the irrigation depth from BM15 to BM22.5, and BM30, with the maximum size of the optimal T-s area under BM22.5. Generally, BM has more advantages in terms of heat preservation and preventing high temperatures compared with NM and PM, respectively. Therefore, the biodegradable film can be recommended as an alternative material to replace the traditional polyethylene film.",,,,,,"Simunek, Jirka/0000-0002-0166-6563",,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-1987,1879-3444,,,,SEP,2021,213,,,,,,,,105116,10.1016/j.still.2021.105116,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.105116,,JUN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000687980700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

High night temperature has been reported to advance growth cessation and bud formation in several tree species grown under controlled conditions. On the other hand, some recent field experiments have shown that autumn warming delays bud formation, although the temperature parameters that could account for this effect have not been identified. In addition, dioecious species have been shown to respond differently to environmental change, and differential warming effects on the sexes have received limited attention, even more so in relation to phenology. In a data set including three separate field experiments employing either experimental warming or an elevational gradient, we tested the effect of different temperature parameters on apical, vegetative bud formation and transitions between bud stages in female and male clones of Eurasian aspen (Populus tremula). Increased temperature was found to delay bud formation, and this process was best explained by maximum daily temperature. Males were significantly delayed compared with females in forming green closed buds, a process best explained by mean 24 h temperature. Bud maturation was best explained by mean daytime temperature, and buds matured significantly faster in males than in females, possibly explaining why females and males did not differ in terms of overall bud formation. In conclusion, our data show that delayed bud formation in Eurasian aspen during autumn can be attributed to the effect of high temperature, and this effect is in contrast to most of the evidence from studies of bud development in controlled environments.",,,,,"Julkunen-Tiitto, Riitta/GRR-9781-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,JAN,2017,37,1,,,,,71,81,,10.1093/treephys/tpw089,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpw089,,,,,,,,28173533,,,,,WOS:000397051600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The graded regime consisted of repeated sustained (three weeks) controlled stepwise temperature changes of 5 or 10 degrees C within 15-25 degrees C on the population dynamics of four dominant species of lake littoral zooplankton, Daphnia longispina (Muller, 1785), Diaphanosoma brachyurum (Lievin, 1848), Simocephalus vetulus (Muller, 1776) and Chydorus sphaericus (Muller, 1785). The results show that controlled stepwise changes (positive or negative) in temperature within the ranges of 15-20, 20-25, and 15-25 degrees C can exert either stimulating or inhibitory effect (direct or delayed) on the development of D. longispina and S. vetulus populations. The development of D. brachyurum and Ch. sphaericus, both more steno-thermophile, was only stimulated by a stable elevated temperature (25 degrees C). These results support the previously formulated hypothesis that, in determining the ecological temperature optimum of a species within a natural community, it is not enough to define its optimum from constant, cyclic or random temperature fluctuations, but also from unidirectional stepwise changes in temperature.

By exposing spider embryos to alternating temperatures of 14 and 32 degrees C for the first 10 days of embryonic development, we obtained eight two-headed individuals, subsequently divided into three groups according to morphological differences. We described in detail morphological abnormalities of the prosoma identified in members of each group. Histological examination confirmed a close relationship between morphological deformities and the brain structure of teratogenically changed spiders. The fusion of appendages (pedipalps and chalicerae) was accompanied by the fusion of corresponding ganglia. The absence of appendages (pedipalps) was accompanied by the absence of corresponding ganglia. This correlation may have resulted from previously impaired neuromere development which led to changes in the morphological structure of the prosoma. Since no deformities were identified in control animals, it can be concluded that bicephaly was caused by exposing embryos to alternating temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using experiments with the green alga, Chlorella vulgaris, we apply the model to show that the temperature dependence of carbon allocation efficiency is key to understanding responses of growth rates to warming at both ecological and longer-term evolutionary timescales. Finally, we assemble a dataset of multiple terrestrial and aquatic autotroph species to show that the effects of temperature-dependent carbon allocation efficiency on potential growth rate TPCs are expected to be consistent across taxa. In particular, both the thermal sensitivity and the optimal temperature of growth rates are expected to change significantly due to temperature dependence of carbon allocation efficiency alone.

The two regimes, 15/5-degrees-C and 9/5-degrees-C day maximum/night minimum temperatures, simulated soil temperatures differences between tilled vs. heavy-residue, no-till conditions, respectively, observed during early spring in eastern Washington. Previous field experiments indicated that some of the Nordic genotypes accumulated more N and dry matter than the PNW cultivars during early spring under no-till conditions. The objective of this experiment was to determined whether these differences 1) are dependent on the temperature of the rooting environment, and 2) are correlated with genotypic differences in NH4+ and NO3-uptake. Overall, shoot N and dry matter accumulation was reduced by 40% due to lower root temperatures during illumination. Leaf emergence was slowed by 14 to 22%, and tiller production was also inhibited. All genotypes absorbed more ammonium than nitrate from equimolar solutions, and the proportion of total N absorbed as NH4+ was slightly higher in the 9/5-degrees-C than the 15/5-degrees-C regime. A Finnish genotype, HJA80201, accumulated significantly more shoot N than the PNW cultivars. 'Clark' and 'Steptoe', and also more than a Swedish cultivar, 'Pernilla', in the 9/5-degrees-C regime. In the 15/5-degrees-C regime Steptoe did not differ in shoot N from the Nordic genotypes, while Clark remained significantly lower. These differences were not correlated to relative propensity for N form. Root lengths of the Nordic genotypes were significantly greater than the PNW genotypes grown under the 9/5-degrees-C regime, while the root lengths in the warmer root temperature regime were not significantly different among genotypes. Higher root elongation rates under low soil temperature conditions may be an inherent adaptive mechanism of the Nordic genotypes. Overall, the data indicate that lower maximum daytime temperatures of the soil surface layer likely account for a significant portion of the growth reductions and lower N uptake observed in no-till systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,,,,,AUG,1991,135,1,,,,,1,8,,10.1007/BF00014773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014773,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991FY02200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For oilseed rape crops, many authors have shown that the radiation use efficiency (RUEa) varies within a wide range, from 1 to 4 g MJ(-1) of Sigma PARa according to developmental stage and environmental conditions. In order to explain this variability, effects of N and temperature on RUEa were investigated during a 1-year field experiment involving three N treatments (N fertilisation rates: 0, 135 and 270 kg ha(-1)). Leaf, flower, and pod surface areas, as well as the DM and N content of the various plant parts were measured every 2-4 weeks for 17 sampling dates from emergence to harvest. RUEa was calculated from total generated DM (shoot and root DM, plus that of dead leaves fallen to the ground). Daily PARa was calculated using a 3-layer model laking into account leaf and pod absorption and reflection of PAR by flowers and soil. The N nutrition index (NNI) proposed by Lemaire and Gastal (1997) was used to evaluate the N effect on RUEa. NNI was significantly higher than the critical N value (meaning that N was non-limiting) for the N270 treatment from emergence to pod formation, but N deficiency occurred with NO at the 12-leaf stage and later with N135 at flowering. The maximum possible RUEa (RUEa(max)) was assumed to be the value obtained with the treatment N270, where N was non-limiting. The N deficiencies which occurred for NO and N135 significantly reduced the green LAI and PAI, and consequently Sigma PARa. To remove any effect other than N on the RUEa, the ratio of actual to maximum RUEa (RUEa/RUEa(max)) proposed by Belanger et al. (1992) was calculated for each developmental stage of oilseed rape. A linear regression fit well (R-2=0.919; 8 d.f.) the response of RUEa/RUEa(max) versus N deficiency, for values of NNI lower than 1. The resulting equation was the following: RUEa/RUEa(max) = 0.74 x NNI + 0.23. RUEa(max) was also significantly affected by developmental stage. Whereas the corresponding changes in RUEa(max) from the 6-leaf stage to the end of flowering could be related to air temperature, there was evidence of a developmental effect in the other stages. RUEa was lower in the early stages (emergence to 5-6 leaves), and from pod formation until ripening; the latter decrease could be attributed to the high energy cost of lipid biosynthesis.

Disease ratings did not reach significant levels for the dry control until day 6 of storage. Regardless of the spore concentration, ratings were similar for inoculated cuttings. Independent of the storage temperature and spore concentration, liners developed minor lesions by day 2 of storage. Cultivars varied slightly in disease ratings, with Tango Dark Red being the most susceptible, followed by Patriot Bright Red, Patriot Rose Pink, and Americana Red. During the 8-day incubation period, 'Patriot Rose Pink' developed the most leaf yellowing compared with the other three cultivars. Liners that experienced variable air temperatures had marginal leaf yellowing by day 2, and this yellowing increased throughout the experiment. Liners placed at 15 degrees C had approximate to 50% less leaf yellowing compared with liners exposed to variable air temperatures until day 8, when leaf yellowing was similar between the two air temperature treatments.

Following after-ripening in winter, seeds experienced a reduction in dormancy and germinated higher at 25 to 35 C mean compared with 10 to 15 C mean With after-ripening for an additional 3 mo in May, seeds experienced a broadening of thermal range (10 to 40 C mean), and germination in natural light or R light was more than twice the germination in the absence of light. Fluctuating temperatures (7 5 C amplitude) improved germination over constant temperatures, except in summer and fall (9 and 12 mo after seed maturation) Exposure of seeds to high temperatures during summer caused secondary dormancy induction.

Burial in spring for 3 to 6 mo induced seed dormancy, and the relative germination in fall (12 mo after seed maturation) was at least 50% higher for seeds retrieved from soil surface compared to seeds exhumed from 10-cm soil depth Seeds retrieved in late summer and fall required natural light or R light for promoting germination, whereas far-red (FR) light or darkness inhibited germination Furthermore, the effect of R and FR light was reversible, indicating a partially phytochrome-mediated germination response of Palmer amaranth seeds following 9 to 12 mo of after-ripening in the field",,,,,"Norsworthy, Jason/GXZ-5733-2022","Norsworthy, Jason/0000-0002-7379-6201",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1745,1550-2759,,,,OCT-DEC,2010,58,4,,,,,426,432,,10.1614/WS-D-09-00038.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WS-D-09-00038.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000283693800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

These chillers have long been considered inefficient because they operate under head pressure control where the condensing temperature is kept high in the refrigeration cycle. This paper considers a novel method to strategically lower the condensing temperature to enhance chiller efficiency at any outdoor temperature. An experiment is carried out on an air-cooled reciprocating chiller to confirm that an electronic expansion valve enables refrigerant to be adequately fed into the evaporator in all operating conditions, even when the condensing temperature falls to around 20 degreesC. By enhancing the heat rejection airflow of the condenser, both the condensing temperature and chiller power can decrease considerably with less fluctuation. According to the algorithm of staging condenser fans, this enhancement corresponds to resetting the set point of the condensing temperature based on any outdoor temperature. The potential and benefits of implementing this reset strategy are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Winter damage/kill can however occur. Studies on low temperature (LT)-induced genes have focused on growth chamber-grown plants at constant LT. Ideally a field experiment would be more representative and provide a better understanding of the role of LT-induced genes during cold acclimation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the expression patterns of selected LT-induced genes, TaCBF20, Wcs120, Wcor410 and Wcor14, in field-grown wheat (winter-hardy Norstar. tender spring Manitou and the near-isogenic lines. spring Norstar and winter Manitou) over 3 years at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Leaf samples were collected at different intervals during the autumn. Generally, cold acclimation of the four genotypes over the 3 years was in agreement with growth chamber studies. However, variability in LT-induced transcript accumulation in the field-grown plants was observed over the 3 years and it could be attributed to the soil temperature fluctuations. Trends in accumulation in early sampling dates indicated that differences among the genotypes could be delineated, depending on the year and LT-induced genes. This study highlights the importance of integrating field and growth chamber studies to obtain a more complete understanding of the critical roles of LT-induced genes in conferring LT tolerance.

The results demonstrated that the increase in population-growth rate and the peak of abundance occurred at the highest temperature and at medium conductivity. Minimum values were obtained at the lowest temperature and conductivities analyzed, but the final density attained was nevertheless similar to those recorded in the pampean environments at the optimum conductivity and during the spring and summer seasons. Males, mictic females, and resting eggs were observed at the minimum and maximum conductivities, revealing the strategy of this species for maintaining dominance in environments with fluctuating salinity.

High precision heat flux plates and thermocouples were installed over multiple rooftops of varying insulation thickness and albedo in the Northeastern United States to monitor the temperature and the heat flux into and out of the roof structures for a whole year. Our analysis shows that while membrane reflectivity (albedo) plays a dominant role in reducing the heat conducted inward through the roof structures during the warmer months, insulation thickness becomes the main roof attribute in preventing heat loss from the buildings during colder months. On a diurnal scale, the thermal state of the white roof structures fluctuated little compared to black roof structures; membrane temperature over white roofs ranged between 10 degrees C and 45 degrees C during summer months compared to black membranes that ranged between 10 degrees C and 80 degrees C. Insulation thickness, apart from reducing the heat conducted through the roof structure, also delayed the transfer of heat, owing to the thermal inertia of the insulation layer.

However, our understanding of how natural short-term diurnal CO2 variability in coral reefs influences longer term anthropogenic ocean acidification remains unclear. Here, we combine observed natural carbonate chemistry variability with future carbonate chemistry predictions for a coral reef flat in the Great Barrier Reef based on the RCP8.5 CO2 emissions scenario. Rather than observing a linear increase in reef flat partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in concert with rising atmospheric concentrations, the inclusion of in situ diurnal variability results in a highly nonlinear threefold amplification of the pCO2 signal by the end of the century. This significant nonlinear amplification of diurnal pCO2 variability occurs as a result of combining natural diurnal biological CO2 metabolism with long-term decreases in seawater buffer capacity, which occurs via increasing anthropogenic CO2 absorption by the ocean. Under the same benthic community composition, the amplification in the variability in pCO2 is likely to lead to exposure to mean maximum daily pCO2 levels of ca. 2100atm, with corrosive conditions with respect to aragonite by end-century at our study site. Minimum pCO2 levels will become lower relative to the mean offshore value (ca. threefold increase in the difference between offshore and minimum reef flat pCO2) by end-century, leading to a further increase in the pCO2 range that organisms are exposed to. The biological consequences of short-term exposure to these extreme CO2 conditions, coupled with elevated long-term mean CO2 conditions are currently unknown and future laboratory experiments will need to incorporate natural variability to test this. The amplification of pCO2 that we describe here is not unique to our study location, but will occur in all shallow coastal environments where high biological productivity drives large natural variability in carbonate chemistry.",,,,,"Tilbrook, Bronte/W-4007-2019; matear, richard J/C-5133-2011; Shaw, Emily/L-4065-2013; Tilbrook, Bronte/A-1522-2012","Tilbrook, Bronte/0000-0001-9385-3827; matear, richard J/0000-0002-3225-0800; Shaw, Emily/0000-0002-4148-3526; Tilbrook, Bronte/0000-0001-9385-3827; Bates, Michael/0000-0002-3729-1417; McNeil, Ben/0000-0001-5765-7087",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,MAY,2013,19,5,,,,,1632,1641,,10.1111/gcb.12154,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12154,,,,,,,,23505026,,,,,WOS:000317284700026,View Full Record in Web of Science

At 35 degrees C, metabolic rates were influenced by sex and diet, with males reared on bramble and tree lucerne having a higher metabolic rate than females reared on the same foodplant, whereas Eucalypt reared animals showing an opposite trend.

The harvested product is the curd, which consists of arrested inflorescence meristems. The switch from vegetative development to curd formation in cauliflower, referred to as the generative switch, is strongly temperature responsive in the majority of varieties. We aimed at measuring the delay in timing of the generative switch by high ambient temperature, and how temperature affects the expression of genes with a potential role in timing of this switch. A seven day increase of six degrees in day and night temperature during vegetative development, results in a substantial delay of the generative switch and increased variation in timing of this switch in sensitive cultivars only. The expression level of the Cauliflower FRUITFULL-like gene BoFULc increased significantly at the generative switch and therefore can be used as marker for this developmental phase change. The expression profiles of the majority of the other investigated cauliflower flowering time genes resembled the expression behaviour of their homologous genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana during the vegetative stage and flowering induction. An exception was the expression of two FLC paralogues BoFLC-1 and BoFLC-3, which showed opposite expression profiles of which the pattern of BoFLC-1 resembles the pattern expected based on Arabidopsis FLC. This interesting observation suggests different roles for these two FLC paralogs in regulation of the timing of the generative switch in cauliflower. Unexpectedly, high temperatures did not delay timing of expression of the majority of investigated genes in meristems and leaves of sensitive cultivars that were delayed in the switch to the generative stage. However, expression of a few potential flowering-time genes was affected by the high temperature treatment in a sensitive cultivar, making them potential candidates to be causal for the observed delay in generative switch.",,,,,"Immink, Richard G.H./A-9825-2011","Ji, Yongran/0000-0002-7747-8702; van Dijk, Aalt-Jan/0000-0002-8872-5123; Sun, Xiaoxue/0000-0003-3636-6162",,,,,,,,,,,,,0098-8472,1873-7307,,,,NOV,2018,155,,,,,,742,750,,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.06.013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.06.013,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000446289500070,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two reference climates were used; one of 18 degrees C day and 17 degrees C night temperature and one average temperature control set at 18 degrees C, both ventilated at 4 degrees C above the temperature set point. A dynamic climate allows the temperature to fluctuate within the wide range from minimum to ventilation set point, but to ensure a reliable development of the plants an average temperature of 18 degrees C was used in all treatments. The climate strategy reached the predetermined average temperature January to March and an overshoot was seen in March to May. The lowest energy use was found in the 15 degrees C 80% photosynthesis climate. The production time of the plants (time to flowering) did not differ between the treatments. The plants responded positively in terms of dry weight accumulation to dynamic climates even though the differences were small and in many cases not significant.

In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta-analytic approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments, Hedges' g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation temperatures (absolute effect: |g| = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this influence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted, with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = -8.42). Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology, performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival. Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least one-year post-hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential to impact fitness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6 degrees C versus 2 degrees C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the treatments fluctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they were constant. The effect also depended on the mid-temperature of the comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest temperatures under climatic change.",,,,,"Noble, Daniel/H-6214-2013","Noble, Daniel/0000-0001-9460-8743",,,,,,,,,,,,,1464-7931,1469-185X,,,,FEB,2018,93,1,,,,,72,97,,10.1111/brv.12333,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12333,,,,,,,,28464349,,,,,WOS:000419965700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dissolved oxygen sensors and pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry were used for the measurements of photosynthetic efficiency. A Diving-PAM revealed that in situ measurements of the effective quantum yield (I broken vertical bar (PSII)) were negatively correlated with incident irradiance. I broken vertical bar (PSII) decreased as irradiance increased at noon and recovered in the evening, suggesting photo-inhibition. A model of the net photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) relationship determined in a laboratory experiment at 26 A degrees C revealed that the net photosynthetic rate quickly increased at irradiances below the estimated saturation irradiance of 154 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) (95 % Bayesian credible interval (BCI) of 117-203 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). Gross photosynthesis and dark respiration under the laboratory measurements were also determined over a range of temperatures (8-42 A degrees C), revealing that the gross photosynthetic rates of 8.0 (BCI 7.03-9.59) mu g O-2 g(ww) (-1) min(-1) at 31.1 (BCI 30.2-32.0)A degrees C, and the dark respiration rate increased exponentially from a low of 0.22 mu g O-2 g(ww) (-1) min(-1) at 10 A degrees C to a high of 1.88 mu g O-2 g(ww) (-1) min(-1) at 42 A degrees C.

This species is considered to be well-adapted to the natural temperature range of study site; however, it is likely close to the marginal temperature conditions.

During periods of elevated temperatures, however, they may provide a vital source of relief to heat-stressed corals. To assess the effect of LAIW on the thermal tolerance of the massive coral Porites lutea, we carried out a onemonth reciprocal LAIW simulation experiment with coral nubbins collected from the LAIW-exposed and LAIW-sheltered sides of the Similan Islands, an offshore archipelago near the Thai Andaman shelf break (distance of sampling locations <3 km). Corals from either origin were subjected to (1) ambient (29 degrees C, pH 839) vs. elevated (31.5 degrees C) temperatures; and (2) ambient temperatures with simulated LAIW (30 minute drops to 23.8 degrees C, pH 7.9, twice per day) vs. elevated temperatures with LAIW (30 minute drops to 24.9 degrees C, pH 7.9, twice per day). Simulated LAIW reduced heat stress responses in all corals. However, nubbins from the LAIW-exposed site showed a higher tolerance to the heat stress than sheltered corals, i.e. lower bleaching- and mortality rates, higher photosynthetic performances and higher protein contents at the end of the experiment, despite identical algal symbiont genotypes (ITS-2, C15). Our results suggest that LAIW-induced nutrient availability, enhanced heterotrophic feeding and thermal variability increased the upper thermal resistance of P. lutea, supporting the notion that LAIW-exposed reefs might be important refugia for coral survival in a warming ocean.

In the fiddler crab Uca pugilator, the historical notion is that color change is regulated by circadian rhythms. In this study, color patterns of U. pugilator were affected by changes in temperature; crab carapaces become light in warm temperatures and dark in colder temperatures. The response to temperature occurred within 15 min (often within 5 min of exposure to the treatment), suggesting that temperature may play a key role in color change, and it is activated not through a hormonal pathway, but rather a direct response of the chromatophores. Color change occurred differently between day and night for each sex, which implies that endogenous rhythms are not the sole mechanism for color change in U. pugilator. Both sexes became darker in the cold treatment, however there were differences between the sexes with high temperatures. Females did not show significant coloration changes, while males became significantly lighter and more speckled. Results from this study suggest sex-specific constraints in response to temperature that could be associated to morphological body mass to surface area ratios, as males have large cheliped, which may be involved in thermoregulation. Constraints could also be associated to different diel activities that each sex performs or visual cues associated with mating behaviors. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Temperatures achieved during solarization follow the diurnal cycle, with maximum temperatures occurring during the day and the minimums during the night. However, most of the information on rate of thermal inactivation of pathogens has been collected in the laboratory under constant temperature conditions. Such data are not readily useful for modeling solarization efficacy. Accurate prediction of the effective level of pest control that one can obtain during a solarization requires that we assess thermal inactivation of pathogens under fluctuating climatic conditions. By modeling, we attempt to separate the effect of heat at varying temperatures on pest control. This can be done either empirically or by utilizing thermal inactivation data, which were accomplished by exposing the pathogens to heat at constant temperatures. Structural solarization is carried out by closing the greenhouse for a certain period of time during the hot season. Air temperature inside the structure during the hot hours can reach levels above 60 degrees C. The consequent relative humidity (RH) drops to 15%; thus, structural solarization can be regarded as dry heating. Low humidity values lead to reduced effectiveness of thermal inactivation of pathogens. Thus, a model of structural solarization should consider both diurnal fluctuating temperatures and RH values. Using a modified Weibull model based on temperature and RH, we were able to obtain good agreement between calculated and observed rates of kill of inoculum of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) and of sclerotia of Sclerotium rolfsii (SR). The R-2 values for FORL control ranged in most experiments from 0.86 to 0.98 and for SR control from 0.82 to 0.94. Soil solarization is carried out in wet soil. Therefore, a model of pest control needs to only consider diurnal temperature fluctuations. The data on pathogen control under constant temperatures were used to develop equations in which the weighting of the obtained temperatures was normalized to degree-hours (NDH). The rate of pathogen control was positively correlated with heating intensity, as expressed in NDH above certain temperatures. The R-2 values for correlations between NDH and pathogen survival during soil solarization at 10 to 40cm depths was 0.53 to 0.86 for FORL and 0.82 to 0.95 for SR. At lower soil depths (40 cm), R-2 values were lower for FORL, suggesting the involvement of additional factors, e.g. biocontrol. The above modeling approaches can provide tools for quantifying solarization effectiveness under various climatic conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,90-6605-218-X,,,,2005,,698,,,,,167,173,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2005.698.22,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2005.698.22,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000237311900022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effects of warm soils on carbon gain and water relations were evaluated for Dichanthelium lanuginosum, a grass that can persist in soils sustained at > 45degreesC by geothermal heating. Microclimate, root and shoot biomass, photosynthetic gas exchange, and soil/plant water relations were measured under different root-zone temperatures in the field and glasshouse. Carbon gain at midsummer decreased markedly for plants in 35-50degreesC vs c. 30degreesC soils, due to foliar necrosis and stomatal constraints to photosynthesis. Daily rates of dehydration, estimated from changes in leaf water potential, were also 30% greater for plants in the warmer soils. Soil water, evapotranspiration, and ratios of root : shoot biomass and area could not explain greater plant dehydration in warmer soils. Reduced uptake of soil water may therefore lead to water stress and stomatal limitations to photosynthesis in warm soils, and may thereby influence the local-scale distribution of D. lanuginosum along steep gradients of soil-temperature within geothermal basins.",,,,,"Germino, Matthew J./F-6080-2013","Germino, Matthew J./0000-0001-6326-7579",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-646X,1469-8137,,,,FEB,2003,157,2,,,,,241,250,,10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00663.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00663.x,,,,,,,,33873631,,,,,WOS:000180609700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specific growth rates in situ ranged from 0.11 to 0.16 d(-1). Growth rates calculated from simulations of growth, based on laboratory-determined temperature-specific growth rates and surface water temperature in Gullmarsfjorden, were similar to or lower than in situ specific growth rates.

The subsequent days to flower (DTF) from the onset of a visible bud decreased from 36 to 27 days as the ADT increased from 17 to 28 degrees C. The DTF from visible bud varied by <3 days among the three cultivars across all temperatures; therefore, cultivar data were pooled to create a stronger prediction model.

The model accurately described the effect of bud width and ADT on flowering time within +/- 3 days for 87% of the actual DTF across all three cultivars.

Paternal half-sib covariance contains a relatively small proportion of the epistatic variance and lacks the dominance variance and variance due to maternal effect, which provides more reliable estimates of additive genetic variance. Experiments were performed on a mass culture population of D. ananassae collected from Kanniyakumari (India). Two extremely stressful temperatures (18A degrees C and 32A degrees C) and one standard temperature (25A degrees C) were used to examine the effect of stressful and non-stressful environments on the morphological and life-history traits in males and females. Mean values of various morphological traits differed significantly among different temperature regimens in both males and females. Rearing at 18A degrees C and 32A degrees C resulted in decreased thorax length, wing-to-thorax (w/t) ratio, sternopleural bristle number, ovariole number, sex comb-tooth number and testis length. Phenotypic variances increased under stressful temperatures in comparison with non-stressful temperatures. Heritability and evolvability based on among-sires (males), among-dams (females), and the sum of the two components (sire + dam) showed higher values at both the stressful temperatures than at the non-stressful temperature. These differences reflect changes in additive genetic variance. Viability was greater at the high than the low extreme temperature. As viability is an indicator of stress, we can assume that stress was greater at 18A degrees C than at 32A degrees C in D. ananassae. The genetic variations for all the quantitative and life-history traits were higher at low temperature. Variation in sexual traits was more pronounced as compared with other morphometric traits, which shows that sexual traits are more prone to thermal stress. Our results agree with the hypothesis that genetic variation is increased in stressful environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0250-5991,0973-7138,,,,JUN,2009,34,2,,,,,263,274,,10.1007/s12038-009-0030-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12038-009-0030-6,,,,,,,,19550042,,,,,WOS:000269191200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Primary dormant seeds did not germinate in darkness at 25 degrees C but acquired the potential to germinate at this temperature within 7 weeks when stored in relative humidities close to 50% across all temperatures. Sorption isotherms and Arrhenius plots demonstrated that the seed moisture content of 0.06 g H2O/g dry weight was a critical value below which dormancy release was associated with reactions of negative activation energy and above which dormancy release increased with temperature. Longer storage times when relative humidity did not exceed 75-85% led to decreased germination at 25 degrees C, corresponding to the induction of secondary dormancy. Dormancy release and induction of secondary dormancy in the dry state were associated with induction or repression of key genes related to abscisic acid and gibberellins biosynthesis and signalling pathways.

Fluctuating abiotic conditions are known to promote the functioning of ecological communities and ecosystems. In the context of wood decay, fluctuating temperature increases decomposition rates. Metabolomics, in tandem with other 'omics tools, can highlight the metabolic processes affected by experimental treatments, even in the absence of genome sequences and annotations. Globally, natural wood decay communities are dominated by the phylum Basidiomycota. We examined the metabolic responses of Mucidula mucida, a dominant constituent of pioneer communities in beech branches in British woodlands, and Exidia glandulosa, a stress-selected constituent of the same communities, in response to constant and diurnally cycling temperature. We applied untargeted metabolomics and proteomics to beech wood blocks, colonised by M. mucida or E. glandulosa and exposed to either diurnally cycling (mean 15 +/- 10 degrees C) or constant (15 degrees C) temperature, in a fully factorial design. Metabolites and proteins linked to lignin breakdown, the citric acid cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and protein biosynthesis and turnover were under-enriched in fluctuating, compared to stable temperatures, in the generalist M. mucida. Conversely, E. glandulosa showed little differential response to the experimental treatments. Synthesis. By demonstrating temperature-dependant metabolic signatures related to nutrient acquisition in a generalist wood decay fungus, we provide new insights into how abiotic conditions can affect community-mediated decomposition and carbon turnover in forests.

Alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) is an important mechanism underlying ambient temperature-controlled responses in plants, yet its regulation is poorly understood. An increase in temperature promotes changes in plant morphology as well as the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in Arabidopsis thaliana via changes in splicing of key regulatory genes. Here we investigate whether a particular histone modification affects ambient temperature-induced alternative splicing and flowering time. Results: We use a genome-wide approach and perform RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses and histone H3 lysine 36 tri-methylation (H3K36me3) chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in plants exposed to different ambient temperatures. Analysis and comparison of these datasets reveal that temperature-induced differentially spliced genes are enriched in H3K36me3. Moreover, we find that reduction of H3K36me3 deposition causes alteration in temperature-induced alternative splicing. We also show that plants with mutations in H3K36me3 writers, eraser, or readers have altered high ambient temperature-induced flowering.

Hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) and rye (Secale cereale L.) were desiccated with a contact herbicide and residue rates ranging from one-fourth to four times the natural residue biomass were established in experiments at Beltsville, MD and Ithaca, NY. Photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was determined above and below residue at approximately monthly intervals after initiation of the experiment. Transmittance of PPFD through residue declined according to an exponential decay function of residue biomass. Transmittance was similar through hairy vetch and rye residue initially, but as the experiment progressed, transmittance through hairy vetch residue was greater than that through rye because of faster decomposition of hairy vetch residue. Spectral analysis from 400 to 1100 nm showed a slight increase in transmittance as wavelength increased resulting in a slight lowering of the red (660 nm) to far-red (730 nm) ratio relative to that of unobstructed sunlight.

J,"Boretti, A",,,,"Boretti, Alberto",,,Testing the hypothesis hydrogen jets may significantly contribute to global warming through jets contrails,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"It has been claimed that hydrogen aviation may still significantly contribute to global warming through jets contrails, as hydrogen jets produce more contrails than jets fueled with kerosene. The claim, based on modeling exercises, can be tested via the Covid-19 experiment. Since March 2020, air traffic has been severely disrupted because of the pandemic. This has been true especially in Australia, the hermit country where citizens have been practically prevented from leaving or returning, with international air travel dramatically reduced. Analysis of the surface temperature data about international airports and air traffic from Australia provides the opportunity to test one of the hypotheses formulated about jet contrails' contribution to global warming. It is shown as opposed to previous claims, jet contrails are not responsible for reducing the difference between the maximum and minimum daily temperatures close to airports. Compared to the last 9 months of 2019, with air traffic normal, during the last 9 months of 2020 of highly disrupted flights, the difference in between the maximum and minimum temperatures in Sydney and Melbourne airports, has not been larger, but smaller by about 1 degrees C. The reduction in the difference between temperatures has been also smaller in Brisbane airport, but only at about 0.22 degrees C. We conclude as the claim adoption of hydrogen as an aviation fuel may produce global warming through the contrails mechanism is likely wrong. The contrails effect is everything but well understood and quantified with accuracy, and poorly represented in climate models. The contrails contribution to global warming is expected to be minor, and it should not void the value of hydrogen as a future renewable fuel free of CO2 emissions.

We performed experiments to clarify whether (1) the emission following wounding can occur at distance from the wounding site, from VOC pools subjected to metabolic signals; and (2) the emission of biogenic VOCs generated by membrane damage (e.g. consequent to wounding or ozone exposure) can also be induced by exposure to high light and high temperature, recurrent in nature. In Phragmites australis, leaf cutting caused large and rapid bursts of acetaldehyde both at the cutting site and on parts of the cut leaf distant from the cutting site. This emission was preceded by a transient stomatal opening and did not occur in conditions preventing stomatal opening. This suggests the presence of a large pool of leaf acetaldehyde whose release is under stomatal control. VOCs other than isoprene, particularly acetaldehyde and (E)-2-hexenal, one of the C-6 compounds formed by the denaturation of membrane lipids, were released by leaves exposed to high temperature and high light. The high-temperature treatment (45 degrees C) also caused a rapid stimulation and then a decay of isoprene emission in Phragmites leaves. Isoprene recovered to the original emission level after suspending the high-temperature treatment, suggesting a temporary deficit of photosynthetically formed substrate under high temperature. Emission of C-6 compounds was slowly induced by high temperature, and remained high, indicating that membrane denaturation occurs also after suspending the high-temperature treatment. Conversely, the emission of C-6 compounds was limited to the high-light episode in Phragmites. This suggests that a membrane denaturation may also occur in conditions that do not damage other important plant processes such as the photochemistry of photosynthesis of photoinhibition-insensitive plants. In the photoinhibition-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana mutant NPQ1, a large but transient emission of (E)-2-hexenal was also observed a few minutes after the high-light treatment, indicating extensive damage to the membranes. However, (E)-2-hexenal emission was not observed in Arabidopsis plants fumigated with isoprene during the high-light treatment. This confirms that isoprene can effectively protect cellular membranes from denaturation. Our study indicates that large, though often transient, VOC emissions by plants occur in nature. In particular, we demonstrate that VOCs can be released by much larger tissues than those wounded and that even fluctuations of light and temperature regularly observed in nature can induce their emissions. This knowledge adds information that is useful for the parameterization of the emissions and for the estimate of biogenic VOC load in the atmosphere.",,,,,"Loreto, Francesco/B-7477-2015; Nogues, Isabel/AAA-7499-2019; Brilli, Federico/O-6475-2015; Gonzalez, Isabel Nogues/K-2118-2012","Loreto, Francesco/0000-0002-9171-2681; Brilli, Federico/0000-0002-2563-6086; Gonzalez, Isabel Nogues/0000-0002-7475-2411",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-7791,,,,,SEP,2006,29,9,,,,,1820,1828,,10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01561.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01561.x,,,,,,,,16913871,,,,,WOS:000239370700014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to their widespread prevalence, these threats often co-occur, yet their interactive effects on organisms remain poorly understood. Some reptiles are vulnerable to these threats because they have specific microclimate requirements for embryonic development and because pollutants are maternally transferred to their eggs; both incubation temperature and pollutants affect reptile sex determination. In aquatic turtles, females often select nest sites in recently planted agricultural fields but the impact of nesting in polluted agricultural habitats is not understood. We examined the influences of crop agriculture and mercury pollution on nest microclimate and offspring sex ratios of Chelydra serpentina. We hypothesized that crop growth in agricultural fields would shade and cool turtle nests, decrease moisture levels, increase male offspring production, and interact with maternally-derived mercury to impact sex determination. As predicted, nests shaded by crops had lower average temperatures (-2.5 degrees C) and moisture levels (-107 kPa) than control nests. In field and laboratory experiments, agricultural thermal regimens increased the proportion of male offspring in clutches and this effect was intensified in the presence of mercury. Global temperatures are expected to rise within the 21st century and to have a feminizing effect on reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination. That prediction should be refined to incorporate how the cooling effect of some local habitat conditions (e.g., agricultural fields), and interactions between anthropogenic land use and common pollutants, will interact with climate change to influence sex ratios of reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination.",,,,,,"Hagen (maiden Thompson), Molly/0000-0002-9068-6549",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,JUN,2018,222,,,,,,64,74,,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.03.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.03.006,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000434745900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we evaluate an alternate approach, the use of experimentally manipulated thermal environments for evaluating stress responses to high environmental temperatures in wild-caught birds housed in captivity. Using an enzyme immunoassay utilizing antibodies against 5 beta-pregnane-3 alpha,11 beta,21-triol-20-one-CMO:SA (tetrahydrocorticosterone), we quantified fGCMs in captive individuals of three southern African arid-zone species (southern pied babblers [Turdoides bicolor], white-browed sparrow-weavers [Plocepasser mahali], and southern yellow-billed hornbills [Tockus leucomelas]) experiencing daily air temperature maxima (T-max) ranging from 30 degrees-32 degrees C to 42 degrees-44 degrees C. For none of the three species did T-max emerge as a significant predictor of elevated fGCM concentrations, and no stress response to simulated hot weather was evident. The apparent lack of a stress response to T-max = 42 degrees C in captive southern pied babblers contrasts with linear increases in fGCMs at T-max > 38 degrees C in free-ranging conspecifics. The lack of an effect of T-max on fGCM levels may potentially be explained by several factors, including differences in operative temperatures and the availability of water and food between free-ranging and captive settings or the stress effect of captivity itself. Our results suggest that experimental manipulations of thermal environments experienced by wild-caught captive birds have limited usefulness for testing hypotheses concerning the effects of hot weather events on fGCM (and, by extension, glucocorticoid) concentrations.",,,,,"Ngcamphalala, Celiwe/AAD-5829-2022","Ngcamphalala, Celiwe/0000-0003-3476-1070; Nicolson, Susan/0000-0001-6024-9383",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,1537-5293,,,,SEP 1,2021,94,5,,,,,330,337,,10.1086/716043,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/716043,,,,,,,,34292861,,,,,WOS:000675592600001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Alton, LA; Franklin, CE",,,,"Alton, Lesley A.; Franklin, Craig E.",,,Do high temperatures enhance the negative effects of ultraviolet-B radiation in embryonic and larval amphibians?,BIOLOGY OPEN,,,,,,,,,,,,"For the embryos and tadpoles of amphibian species, exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR) can be lethal, or cause a variety of sublethal effects. Low temperatures enhance the detrimental effects of UVBR and this is most likely because the enzyme-mediated processes involved in the repair of UVBR-induced damage function less effectively at low temperatures. Whether these repair processes are also impaired, and thus the negative effects of UVBR similarly enhanced, at high temperatures is not known, but is an ecologically relevant question to ask given that organisms that inhabit environments where the temperature fluctuates widely on a daily timescale are likely to experience high doses of UVBR when temperatures are high. Here we examined the thermal-dependence of UVBR effects in the context of an ecologically-relevant fluctuating UVBR and temperature regime to test the hypothesis that exposure to peak UVBR levels while the temperature is high (35 degrees C) is more detrimental to embryonic and larval Limnodynastes peronii than exposure to peak UVBR levels while the temperature is moderate (25 degrees C). Embryos exposed to peak UVBR levels at 35 degrees C hatched 10 h later than those exposed to peak UVBR levels at 25 degrees C and, as tadpoles, were smaller and consequently swam more slowly but, in an environment with predators, exhibited no difference in survival time. There was also no effect of experimental treatment on the hatching success of embryos, nor on the post-hatch survival of tadpoles. These findings, therefore, are not sufficiently strong to support our hypothesis that high temperatures enhance the negative effects of UVBR in embryonic and larval amphibians. (C) 2012.

Bracting, where small cauline leaves develop and penetrate the curd surface, is caused by high temperatures - a kind of de-vernalization. Riciness, on the other hand, where small flower buds develop on the curd surface, is caused by low temperatures, especially after a preceding period of high temperature - a kind of strong vernalization. Both bracting and riciness can be induced only at certain stages during plant development. Plots of cauliflower were given periods of different temperature treatments in the field by portable compartments with both cooling and heating units. The treatments were both constant high or low temperatures (24, 18, 13 and 8degreesC) in 10 d periods, and alternating high and low temperatures (23/23, 23/15, 23/10 and 23/5degreesC) in 7 d periods. The treatments were started both before and after curd induction. The incidences of bracting and riciness in harvested curds were recorded in 84 plots with different temperature regimes. These data were used to estimate the combined effect of plant development and temperature on quality defects. The responsive developmental stages in the plants were described by a parabolic function, which depends on the apex/curd diameter. The curd diameter with the highest risk of induction of bracting was estimated to be around 12 mm (range 1-23 mm). A combined model of the diameter function and the summation of daily average temperature with a base temperature of 15 C explained 66% of the variation in the data of observed bracting. The apex diameter with the highest risk of induction of riciness was estimated to be around 0.35 mm (range 0.2-0.5 mm). A combined model of sensitive apex diameter and the preceding temperatures (average daily temperature of 10 d), during a temperature drop (average minimum temperature of 10 d), and after (average daily temperature of 6 d) explained 71% of the variation in the data of observed riciness. These models may be used to set up test equipment and to test susceptibility of new cultivars in breeding programmes. On a farm level, the models may be used to forecast risk of quality defects in cauliflower production. Alternatively, the knowledge of how the combination of developmental stage and temperature scenario induce either bracting or riciness may be used to study flower induction by temperature.",,,,,"Olesen, Jørgen E/C-2905-2016; Olesen, Jørgen/Y-2857-2019; Veierskov, Bjarke/H-3024-2014","Olesen, Jørgen E/0000-0002-6639-1273; Olesen, Jørgen/0000-0002-6639-1273; Veierskov, Bjarke/0000-0002-3676-5895",,,,,,,,,,,,,1462-0316,,,,,SEP,2003,78,5,,,,,638,646,,10.1080/14620316.2003.11511677,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14620316.2003.11511677,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000185693300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) is one of the most important forest pests in Central Europe, but despite this the effects of temperature on life history and population growth are largely unknown. This study examines the effects of temperature on reproduction and intrinsic demographic statistics. 2. Laboratory experiments on oviposition were carried out at six temperatures in the range 12-33 degrees C, using the so-called sandwich rearing technique for bark beetles. 3. A linear relationship between oviposition rates and temperatures in the range 15-25 degrees C was used to estimate the lower temperature threshold for oviposition as 11.4 degrees C. With a nonlinear model fitted to the data across the whole range of experimental temperatures, the lower and upper limiting temperatures and optimum temperature were found to be 7.9, 33.7, and 28.9 degrees C, respectively. A model for daily oviposition rate was fitted, which describes the pattern of oviposition over the entire oviposition period. 4. The analysis of life tables, combining developmental rates, reproduction, mortality, and sex ratio, suggests maximum population growth (r(m)) at near 30 degrees C. 5. After generating a first brood, spruce bark beetles often re-emerge from the tree and produce other sister broods. The effects of temperature and number of sister broods on demography were evaluated using age-specific life-table analyses. It is hypothesized that sister broods play an important role in regions where I. typographus is monovoltine, but have only moderate significance where this species has more than one generation per season.",,,,,"Wermelinger, Beat/N-3601-2016","Wermelinger, Beat/0000-0003-3235-6741",,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,,,,,FEB,1999,24,1,,,,,103,110,,10.1046/j.1365-2311.1999.00175.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2311.1999.00175.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000078884500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study deals with the relationship between temperature and aestivation. Sea cucumbers were allocated into four treatments. In two treatments of temperature elevation, the ambient temperature gradually was increased from 16 degrees C to 26 degrees C linearly (treatment FA) or by a fluctuating temperature profile (treatment FB). Two control treatments maintained constant temperatures of 16 degrees C and 26 degrees C, and were designated as optimum temperature of growth and threshold of aestivation, respectively. During the 40-day experiment, body weight, oxygen consumption, daily food intake, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dimutase (SOD) activities and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) levels were determined periodically. When the temperature gradually increased from 16 degrees C to 26 degrees C, the body weight of the tested sea cucumbers decreased gradually. After the ambient temperature reached 26 degrees C, the tested sea cucumbers in treatments of FA and F13 were reared at 26 degrees C for an additional twenty days. During this period, symptoms of aestivation appeared in the tested sea cucumbers. Activities of antioxidases and Hsp70 levels increased when the ambient temperature increased from 16 degrees C to 26 degrees C, and decreased when the temperature was kept at 26 degrees C. These results indicate that aestivation in A. japonicurs is an adaptive strategy to reduce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and denatured proteins which were induced at high temperature.

The system was applied to store and preserve spinach under dynamic temperature conditions. A target O-2 concentration of 11.1 kPa, which was suitable for the commodity, was set in order to keep the CO2 concentration below the upper limit of 10.1 kPa, according to the interactive relationship between O-2 and CO2 levels. The adaptively controlled modified atmosphere (MA) container could maintain its O-2 concentration around the target value for the experimental duration of storage under dynamic temperature conditions with or without initial hypobaric application. The initial opening time ratio just after reaching the target O-2 concentration was adjusted or modified to accommodate the container conditions and/or the current produce respiration. Generally, increased storage temperature, which increased the produce respiration, tended to shift the opening time ratio towards a higher value with some lag and vice versa. An initial hypobaric treatment at 90 kPa, applied to expedite attainment of the target O-2 concentration, resulted in reducing slightly the CO2 concentration at the steady state. The MA container system adaptively controlled under dynamic temperature conditions could preserve the product quality better compared to the control air package; however, further developments are needed to reduce moisture losses from the produce.

The high spatial and temporal resolution datasets are urgently needed for a variety of environmental change studies, especially in remote areas with few LST observation stations. MODIS and Landsat satellites have complementary characteristics in terms of spatial and temporal resolution for LST retrieval. To make full use of their respective advantages, this paper developed a pixel-based multi-spatial resolution adaptive fusion modeling framework (called pMSRAFM). As an instance of this framework, the data fusion model for joint retrieval of LST from Landsat-8 and MODIS data was implemented to generate the synthetic LST with Landsat-like spatial resolution and MODIS temporal information. The performance of pMSRAFM was tested and validated in the Heihe River Basin located in China. The results of six experiments showed that the fused LST was high similarity to the direct Landsat-derived LST with structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.83 and the index of agreement (d) of 0.84. The range ofSSIMwas 0.65-0.88, the root mean square error(RMSE)yielded a range of 1.6-3.4 degrees C, and the averagedbiaswas 0.6 degrees C. Furthermore, the temporal information of MODIS LST was retained and optimized in the synthetic LST. TheRMSEranged from 0.7 degrees C to 1.5 degrees C with an average value of 1.1 degrees C. When compared with in situ LST observations, the mean absolute error andbiaswere reduced after fusion with the mean absolute bias of 1.3 degrees C. The validation results that fused LST possesses the spatial pattern of Landsat-derived LSTs and inherits most of the temporal properties of MODIS LSTs at the same time, so it can provide more accurate and credible information. Consequently, pMSRAFM can be served as a promising and practical fusion framework to prepare a high-quality LST spatiotemporal dataset for various applications in environment studies.",,,,,,"zhang, yaonan/0000-0001-8905-9006; Tan, Junlei/0000-0001-9710-1868",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1424-8220,,,,AUG,2020,20,15,,,,,,,4337,10.3390/s20154337,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20154337,,,,,,,,32759664,,,,,WOS:000559208600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Salmon are particularly vulnerable to temperature changes because their reproductive and early development life phases are spent in freshwater river systems where temperature fluctuates widely both daily and seasonally. Flow regulation downstream of dams can also cause temperature regime changes, which in turn may spur local adaptation of early life-history traits. In a common garden laboratory incubation experiment, we exposed spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) embryos to four temperature regimes: warm stable, cold stable, daily variation and below dam. We found that fry from warmer thermal regimes emerged earlier than those from colder regimes both in terms of calendar date and temperature units and that warmer temperatures caused fry to emerge less developed. There was also a significant effect of family on both emergence timing and development level at emergence.

However, few studies have investigated the range of temperatures and timing which determine rind colour break. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between range of soil temperature (ST) and rind colour development in the precocious Clemenpons Clementine mandarin. Reflective white plastic mulch was used to modify root temperature. RESULTS: Mulching increased reflected light and reduced daily maximum ST and temperature range, major differences being established 70-30 days before harvest. Rind colour-break correlated positively with 20 degrees C < ST < 23 degrees C; thus, 20-23 degrees C appears to be the ST threshold interval for fruit colouration. The sooner the soil reached it, the sooner the fruit changed rind colour. In our experiments, control trees accumulated 565 h at this ST interval before fruit changed colour, whereas in treated trees it occurred 2 weeks earlier. Hence, in treated trees the colour break was advanced by 2 weeks and this increased the percentage of fruit harvested at the first picking date by up to 2.5-fold. CONCLUSIONS: Fruit colour-break does not take place at a certain ST, but after several hours at a ST of 20-23 degrees C. In our experiments, reducing ST during the 2 months before harvest advances the first picking date in the 'Clemenpons' Clementine mandarin.

All species flowered earlier under NI than SD and were classified as facultative (quantitative) long-day plants. Increasing the daily light integral within long-day treatments increased flower bud number for P. axillaris only. In a second experiment, crop timing and quality were evaluated in the temperature range of 14 to 26 degrees C under 16-h UPS. The rate of progress toward flowering for each species increased as temperature increased from 14 to 26 degrees C, suggesting the optimal temperature for development is at least 26 degrees C. The calculated base temperature for progress to flowering varied from 0.1 degrees C for P. exserta to 5.3 degrees C for P. integrifolia. Flowering of P. axillaris and P. integrifolia was delayed developmentally (i.e., increased node number below the first flower) at 14 degrees C and 17 degrees C or less, respectively, compared with higher temperatures.

However, little is known about how temperature variability through time influences mineralization processes. Here, we investigated how short-term temperature history affects the mineralization of SOM and plant litter in soils from different agricultural management systems. We used soils from a long-term experiment with conventional and organic management treatments to set up microcosms. The microcosms were exposed to eight days of contrasting temperature regimes (different mean temperatures and constant versus fluctuating temperatures). Microcosms were then returned to a common temperature of 16 degrees C, C-13-labelled plant litter was added to half of them, and CO2 efflux was measured over the following week. We found that SOM and litter mineralization were both sensitive to the temperature history, with lower mean temperatures during preliminary treatment associated with higher mineralization during the subsequent common-temperature incubation. This effect persisted through the week after temperature differences were removed. Different patterns of temperature fluctuation and agricultural management did not significantly affect mineralization during common-temperature incubation. The history sensitivity of litter mineralization, despite litter being added after temperature differences had ended, indicates that the temperature history effects may be driven by short-term microbial acclimation. We conclude that organic matter and litter mineralization, which are key processes in the carbon cycle, are sensitive to short-term temperature history. This suggests that future investigations of soil CO2 efflux may need to take recent weather effects into account.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-0717,1879-3428,,,,NOV,2020,150,,,,,,,,107985,10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107985,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107985,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000581509300026,View Full Record in Web of Science

When the temperature decreases below -5?degrees C, the liquid water in the cyanobacterial cells may freeze. In the natural environment, the temperature gradually decreases from autumn to winter, and the diurnal temperatures fluctuate enormously. It was hypothesized that the physiology of cyanobacterial cells changes in later autumn to acclimatize the cells to the upcoming freezing temperatures. In the present study, an incubation experiment in growth chambers was designed to stimulate the responses of cyanobacterial cells to diurnal temperature variations before freezing in late autumn. The results showed that light cyanobacterial soil crusts are more tolerant to diurnal temperature fluctuations than dark cyanobacterial soil crusts. After the first diurnal temperature cycle between 24 and -4?degrees C, the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents increased and the photosynthetic activity decreased. The superoxide dismutase activity increased, more extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) were secreted and the ratios of the light-harvesting and light-screening pigments decreased. With increasing numbers of diurnal temperature cycles, the MDA contents and photosynthetic activity gradually returned to their initial levels. Our results suggest that there are at least three pathways by which crust-forming cyanobacteria acclimate to the diurnal temperature cycles in the late autumn in the Hopq Desert, Northwest China. These three pathways include increased secretion of EPS, regulation of the ratios of light-harvesting and light-screening pigments, and activation of the antioxidant system. The results also indicate that late autumn is a critical period for the protection and restoration of the cyanobacterial soil crusts in the Hopq Desert.",,,,,"Zhang, Quanfa/H-1922-2011","wang, wei bo/0000-0001-6937-9686",,,,,,,,,,,,,0233-111X,1521-4028,,,,JAN,2013,53,1,,,,,72,80,,10.1002/jobm.201100510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.201100510,,,,,,,,22581520,,,,,WOS:000313984700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, we currently lack general empirical insights into variation in microbial CUE at the level of individual taxa. Here, through experiments with 29 strains of environmentally isolated bacteria, we find that bacterial CUE typically responds either positively to temperature, or has no discernible response, within biologically meaningful temperature ranges. Using a global data synthesis, we show that these results are generalisable across most culturable groups of bacteria. This variation in the thermal responses of bacterial CUE is taxonomically structured, and stems from the fact that relative to respiration rates, bacterial population growth rates typically respond more strongly to temperature, and are also subject to weaker evolutionary constraints.

Consequently, temperature-induced plasticity which may help buffering detrimental effects of temperature variation has received considerable attention over recent decades. Laboratory studies have almost exclusively used constant temperatures, while in nature, temperature typically shows pronounced daily fluctuations. Using a factorial design with constant versus fluctuating temperatures and a higher versus a lower mean temperature, we here investigate in the butterfly Lycaena tityrus whether the use of constant temperatures is justified. Fluctuating compared to constant temperatures caused shorter development times, increased heat but decreased cold stress resistance, decreased heat-shock protein expression, and increased immunocompetence. Thus, overall, fluctuating temperatures were more beneficial to the butterflies compared to constant ones. However, despite substantial variation across temperature regimes, the ranking of trait values among treatments remained largely unaffected (e.g. lower constant as well as fluctuating temperatures caused increased pupal mass). Thus, we tentatively conclude that there is no general reason for concern about using constant temperatures in studies investigating phenotypic plasticity, which seem to comprise a fair proxy. However, substantial differences in mean values as well as interactive effects suggest that one needs to be cautious. We further demonstrate negative effects of high temperatures on butterfly immune function, which seem to result from a trade-off between the latter and the heat shock response.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,MAY,2011,166,1,,,,,23,33,,10.1007/s00442-011-1917-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-1917-0,,,,,,,,21286923,,,,,WOS:000289442000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We tested the hypothesis that salinity alters photosynthetic responses to seasonal changes in temperature and vapor pressure deficit (D), as well as thermal acclimation _of leaf respiration in black mangrove (Avicennia germinans). To test this hypothesis, we grew seedlings of A. germinans in an outdoor experiment for similar to 12 months under four treatments spanning 0 to 55 ppt porewater salinity. We repeatedly measured seedling growth and in situ rates of leaf net photosynthesis (A(sat)) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (g(s)) at prevailing leaf temperatures, along with estimated rates of Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron transport for RuBP regeneration (J(max)), and measured rates of leaf respiration at 25 degrees C (R-area(25)). We developed empirical models describing the seasonal response of leaf gas exchange and photosynthetic capacity to leaf temperature and D, and the response of R-area(25) to changes in mean daily air temperature. We tested the effect of salinity on model parameters. Over time, salinity had weak or inconsistent effects on A(sat), g(s) and R-area(25). Salinity also had little effect on the biochemical parameters of photosynthesis (V-cmax, J(max)) and individual measurements of A(sat), g(s), V-cmax and J(max) showed a similar response to seasonal changes in temperature and D across all salinity treatments. Individual measurements of R-area(25) showed a similar inverse relationship with mean daily air temperature across all salinity treatments. We conclude that photosynthetic responses to seasonal changes in temperature and D, as well as seasonal temperature acclimation of leaf R, are largely consistent across a range of salinities in A. germinans.

Bromus. tectorum dominates higher and more northern landscapes than its sister species B. rubens, which is a severe invader in the Mojave desert region of the American Southwest. To assess climate thresholds controlling their distinct geographic ranges, we evaluated the winter cold tolerance of B. tectorum and B. rubens. Freezing tolerance thresholds were determined using electrolyte leakage and whole-plant mortality. The responses of the two species to winter cold and artificial freezing treatments were similar in 20072008 and 20092010. When grown at minimum temperatures of 10 degrees C, plants of both species had cold tolerance thresholds near -10 degrees C, while plants acclimated to a daily minimum of -10 to -30 degrees C survived temperatures down to -31 degrees C. In the winter of 20102011, a sudden severe cold event on December 9, 2010 killed all B. rubens populations, while B. tectorum was not harmed; all tested plants were 78 weeks old. Controlled acclimation experiments demonstrated that 8-week-old plants of B. rubens had a slower acclimation rate to subzero temperatures than B. tectorum and could not survive a rapid temperature drop from 1 to -14 degrees C. Four-month-old B. rubens populations were as cold tolerant as B. tectorum. Our results show that severe and sudden freeze events in late autumn can kill young plants of B. rubens but not B. tectorum.

These over-pressure zones further affect hydraulic gradients which influence water and nutrient flow direction and rate. The dynamics of entrapped gas are of global interest because the loss of this gas to the atmosphere via ebullition (bubbling) is likely the dominant transport mechanism of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere from peatlands, which are the largest natural terrestrial source per annum of atmospheric CH4. We investigated the relationship between atmospheric pressure and temperature on volumetric gas content (VGC) and CH4 ebullition using a laboratory peat core incubation experiment. Peat cores were incubated at three temperatures (one core at 4 degrees C, three cores at 11 degrees C, and one core at 20 degrees C in sealed PVC cylinders, instrumented to measure VGC, pore-water CH4 concentrations, and ebullition (volume and CH4 concentrations). Ebullition events primarily occurred (71% of the time) during periods of falling atmospheric pressure. The duration of the drop in atmospheric pressure had a larger control on ebullition volume than the magnitude of the drop. VGC in the 20 degrees C core increased from the onset of the experiment and reached a fluctuating but time-averaged constant level between experiment day 30 and 115. The chance in VGC was low for the 11 degrees C cores for the initial period of the experiment but showed large increases when the growth chamber temperature increased to 20 degrees C due to a malfunction. The core maintained at 4 degrees C showed only a small increase in entrapped gas content throughout the experiment. The 20 degrees C core showed the largest increase in VGC. The increases in VGC occurred despite pore-water concentrations of CH4 being below the equilibrium solubility level.

Few studies, however, report oil the effect of plastic film mulches on root zone temperature oil broccoli. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of colored plastic mulches on root zone temperature and broccoli plant growth and yield Broccoli ('Packman') plants were grown using plastic film mulch and drip irrigation. The treatments consisted of plastic Film mulch (black. blue, gray on black, red, silver on black, and white on black mulches) and bare soil. Colored plastic film mulches affected root zone temperature and the accumulation of soil degree-days. Mean daily RZT, maximal daily RZT and degree day accumulation in the soil were highest in dark-colored mulches (blue, black, red, and gray) and lowest in light-colored mulches (silver and white), while minimal daily RZT was highest in silver mulch and lowest in white mulch. Silver mulch Showed the smallest diurnal fluctuations in RZT among plastic mulches, with the highest RZT during the night and among the lowest in the afternoon. Colored plastic mulches also affected broccoli plant growth and yield, although the effect of mulches was more dramatic in the spring than in the fall seasons. Broccoli yield was linearly related to both the vegetative top dry weight and root dry weight of mature plants. Broccoli yield was little affected at mean RZT of <21 C but increased with increasing mean RZTs above 21 degrees C up to 25 degrees C. Thus, broccoli plant growth and yield responded more favorably to dark-colored mulches than to light-colored mulches, suggesting that broccoli benefited from increased soil warming. No high RZT stress effects oil broccoli plant growth or yield were observed in this study. Thus, this study suggests that plastic film mulches, particularly the dark-colored mulches, may be an option for spring broccoli production in areas with cool conditions early in the spring.

Despite the critical importance of soil temperature on winter survival of golf greens, little information exists on the effects of commercially available protective covers on soil temperatures regimes during winter. This 3-yr (1993-1996) field study was conducted to determine the influence of different winter protective covers on golf green soil temperature under two northern climate conditions (thick or thin snow cover). Six winter protection treatments were tested: permeable covers; impermeable covers; curled wood shavings mat, straw mulch, and 5 cm air space (each under an impermeable cover); and a control treatment without any protection. Daily climatological data and soil temperatures under protective covers were recorded at two experimental sites (Quebec City and St-Lambert, Montreal, Canada). Throughout the winter seasons, soil temperatures under protective covers and control plots remained around 0 degrees C under a thick and stable snow cover (average of 42 cm during experiment). Under thin snow cover (average of 6 cm during experiment), minimum crown temperatures were markedly influenced by winter covers and reached a minimum over all years of -20.6, -19.5, -18.2, -11.1, -6.6, and -1.0 degrees C for control, impermeable, permeable, curled wood mat, air space, and straw treatments, respectively. The insulating material covers (curled wood mat, air space, and straw) reduced soil temperature variation ranges, minimized the impact of freezing air temperature and thin snow cover, and consequently enhanced winter survival of golf greens under thin snow cover. Thus, depending on local conditions, and particularly on snow cover, the characteristics of specific protective covers can influence golf green soil temperatures and turfgrass survival during the overwintering period.",,,,,"Desjardins, Yves/F-1222-2013","Desjardins, Yves/0000-0002-0398-2797",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-1962,,,,,MAR-APR,1999,91,2,,,,,227,233,,10.2134/agronj1999.00021962009100020009x,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1999.00021962009100020009x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081646800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mass-recruiting species deposit long-lasting anonymous chemical trails, while group-recruiting species use temporary chemical trails. We studied how high temperature influenced the foraging behavior of a mass-recruiting species (Tapinoma nigerrimum) and a group-recruiting species (Aphaenogaster senilis) through pheromone decay. First, under controlled laboratory conditions, we examined the effect of temperature on the trail pheromone of both species. A substrate, simulating soil, marked with gaster extract was heated for 10 min. at 25A degrees, 35A degrees, 45A degrees, or 55 A degrees C and offered to workers in a choice test. Heating gaster extract reduced the trail following behavior of the mass-recruiters significantly more than that of the group-recruiters. Second, analyses of the chemicals present on the substrate indicated that most T. nigerrimum gaster secretions vanished at 25 A degrees C, and only iridodials persisted up to 55 A degrees C. By contrast, A. senilis secretions were less volatile and resisted better to elevated temperatures to some extent. However, at 55 A degrees C, the only chemicals that persisted were nonadecene and nonadecane. Overall, our results suggest that the foraging behavior of the group-recruiting species A. senilis is less affected by pheromone evaporation than that of the mass-recruiting species T. nigerrimum.

However, the extent of lipid remodeling and the associated fitness consequences under continuous temperature fluctuations are not well-described. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of repeated temperature fluctuations on fatty acid composition and thermal tolerance. We exposed the springtail Orchesella cincta to two constant temperatures of 5 and 20 degrees C, and a continuously fluctuating treatment between 5 and 20 degrees C every 2 days. Fatty acid composition differed significantly between constant low and high temperatures. As expected, animals were most cold tolerant in the low temperature treatment, while heat tolerance was highest under high temperature. Under fluctuating temperatures, fatty acid composition changed with temperature initially, but later in the experiment fatty acid composition stabilized and closely resembled that found under constant warm temperatures. Consistent with this, heat tolerance in the fluctuating temperature treatment was comparable to the constant warm treatment. Cold tolerance in the fluctuating temperature treatment was intermediate compared to animals acclimated to constant cold or warmth, despite the fact that fatty acid composition was adjusted to warm conditions. This unexpected finding suggests that in animals acclimated to fluctuating temperatures an additional underlying mechanism is involved in the cold shock response. Other aspects of homeoviscous adaptation may protect animals during extreme cold. This paper forms a next step to fully understand the functioning of ectotherms in more thermally variable environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Three temperature-based stress indices were tested using corn and cotton grown under different water levels to determine how well these indices correlated with the amount of water applied and crop yield. Corn and cotton were grown in 1997-1998 field experiments using a range of irrigation levels where canopy temperatures (TC) and field weather were continuously measured The water levels in 1997 were WL1-dryland, WL2- 1/3*ET: WL3- 2/3*ET and WL4-1.0*ET where ET was potential evapotranspiration. The water levels used in 1998 were WL3 and WL4 in corn and WL1 and WL4 with cotton. An average ET value of 7 mm d(-1) was used as the 1.0*ET water level of each crop in 1997 and 8 mm d(-1) was applied to corn in 1998. The stress time index (ST) quantifies water stress as the daily summation of time when TC exceeds the crop specific optimum temperatures (28 degrees C for both crops). The theoretical CWSI-T and empirical CWSI-TC, forms of the crop water stress index were used. CWSI-T is a physically based description of the energy-exchange processes that determine the temperature of a crop. CWSI-TC is calculated from measured TC of the crop, a well-watered crop (WL4), and a computed TCmax for a completely water stressed crop. The ST index was calculated for the Midday Daytime, and Entire Day periods, which were determined by threshold levels of net radiation and air temperature. The ST values for the Daytime and Entire Day periods increased as water applied decreased from WL4 to WL1, and were significantly different among water levels. ST values for the Entire Day were higher than during the Daytime period only in 1998. CWSI-T and CWSI-TC values in both years declined as the quantity of water applied increased in both crops. The CWSI value (0.89)for WL1 corn was highest in 1997, which agreed with early senescence from water stress. The CWSI-TC procedure was more accurate than CWSI-T method because it restricted the stress value for well-watered treatment (WL4) to zero, and all values were within the theoretical range of 0 to 1.0. Each water stress index had a unique but common relationship with water applied and yield in both years for cotton, but each year was different for corn.

The hybrid model was trained using observed LE over 2012/ 2013-2014, and validated using observed LE for 2015 and leave-one-out cross-validation. The results show that the three SM constraints schemes exhibited some modeling differences at the flux tower site scale. LE estimation using SM achieved the highest correlation (R-2 - 0.87, p < 0.01) and lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 20.1 W/m(2)) compared to schemes using RH or DT schemes. We then produced regional daily LE maps at 1 km x 1 km across the HRB for 2013-2015. Regional analysis shows that our LE estimates from all three constraint models exhibited large spatial variability and strong seasonal and annual variations, attributed to differences in parameterizing the model water constraints.

Firstly, simulations were conducted over a wide range of realistic scenarii, notably by including vegetation canopy-scale cavity effect. Secondly, the experimental design included the features of second generation Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (MCT) cooled detectors with lower instrumental noises and finer channels. Thirdly, as opposed to previous studies that used predefined spectral configurations to determine the most suited one, we conducted an optimization of the spectral configuration by crossing, on a pair basis, several positions of the four TIR channels over a range of wavelengths. Fourthly, we quantified the TES sensitivity to atmospheric perturbations, by comparing LST retrievals with and without atmospheric noise. We observed an overall moderate sensitivity of TES LST retrievals to the spectral channel positions, with a maximum RMSE variation of 0.31 K within the atmospheric spectral windows. Furthermore, the TES method was sensitive to three main parameters, namely the instrumental noise, the atmospheric downwelling irradiance, and the transmittance due to ozone and water vapor, with RMSEs larger than 1 K for specific channel locations. Moreover, by considering possible superimposition of two channels, we noted that the TES method could achieve similar performance by considering three or four channels. Eventually, our study enabled us to recommend a new spectral configuration for the TRISHNA TIR instrument, that is more robust to atmospheric perturbations and to uncertainties on channel positions and bandwidths.",,,,,"Jacob, Frederic P/A-5946-2011","Jacob, Frederic P/0000-0002-2491-3096",,,,,,,,,,,,,0034-4257,1879-0704,,,,APR,2022,272,,,,,,,,112939,10.1016/j.rse.2022.112939,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.112939,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000759728300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In recent years, the greenhouse effect and heavy rain have threatened the growth and survival of corals. Previous research mainly discussed the harm caused by changes in temperature and salinity to corals. No research has explored effective methods to prevent coral bleaching and death. This study initially found that feeding can promote corals to survive stress response, prevent bleaching or death caused by temperature or salinity changes and significantly improve the number of eggs laid, larval settlement and juvenile development. At present, this technology has been applied to the large-scale production of Briareum violacea in coral farms to prevent coral deaths caused by changes in temperature and salinity. In addition, this is very important for the sustainable development of coral reefs. In recent years, climate change has often caused fluctuations in seawater salinity and temperature, which threaten the survival and growth of corals. Effectively improving the stress response to temperature and salinity changes in corals to prevent bleaching is one of the important issues. This study initially explored the use of artificial polyunsaturated fatty acids to assess the ability of Briareum violacea to slow bleaching, enhance growth, stabilize larval development and reduce antistress factors (superoxide dismutase and catalase) when they were exposed to temperature and salinity stress. The salinities used in the experiment were 25, 30, 35 and 40 psu, and the temperatures were 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. It was divided into two parts: Experiment 1-Effects of temperature and salinity and feeding on digestive enzymes, reproduction and stress response of B. violacea; Experiment 2-Effects of temperature and salinity and feeding on the settlement and survival of larvae. The results showed that the feeding treatment group reduced the superoxide dismutase, catalase and mortality of corals under stress and significantly improved larval development and larval settlement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2079-7737,,,,MAR,2022,11,3,,,,,,,410,10.3390/biology11030410,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11030410,,,,,,,,35336784,,,,,WOS:000775974700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, a method based on laboratory experiment was proposed to predict sediment transport capacity using the thawed soil depth derived from temperature at different soil depths measured during the experimental time period. A saturated soil column with platinum resistance sensors at depths of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm from the soil surface was placed in a freezer at -25, -20, and -15 degrees C until it was totally frozen and then placed in an incubator with a constant temperature of 25, 30, and 35 degrees C. The thawing processes of the frozen soil column were monitored by the sensors that measured temperature during the experimental time. Based on soil heat conduction mechanism, the relations among soil depth, temperature, and time were deduced as a function to predict thawed soil depth giving the frozen temperature, soil temperature inside the incubator, and time after being placed in the incubator. The sediment transport capacity was then calculated by combining the deduced thawed soil depth function and an existing model. The predicted sediment transport capacity was compared with laboratory measurements in literatures. The results show that the model has the ability of predicting sediment transport capacity ranged from 0.019 to 0.598 kg s(-1) m(-1) with high R-2 of 0.99 and 0.98. It suggests that the proposed model can be used to predict the sediment transport capacity by concentrated meltwater flow on different thawed soil slope.

The: interactions between temperature and dietary protein concentration in affecting consumption, growth and efficiency in fifth-instar caterpillars of Manduca sexta were studied, using both short-term (4h) and long-term (duration of fifth stadium) experiments. The short-term experiments examined constant temperatures between 14 and 42 degrees C, whereas the long-term experiments examined constant temperatures between 18 and 34 degrees C; both experiments considered two levels of dietary protein. In both expects, caterpillars had significantly higher consumption and Erase production rates on low-protein compared with high-protein diets at each test temperature between 18 and 34 degrees C, thereby compensating for the lower diet quality. In contrast, at more extreme temperatures (14 and 42 degrees C) in the short-term studies, consumption and frass production rates were lower on low-protein compared with high-protein diets. As a result, there were substantial interactions between temperature and dietary protein for consumption and frass production rates in the short-term experiments, but not in the long-term experiments. These results suggest that interactions between temperature and dietary protein may emerge because of.,the failure of compensatory feeding responses at low and high temperatures. It is hypothesized that the failure of compensatory responses is more Likely to occur under diurnally fluctuating temperatures than under a constant temperature with the same mean, and it is proposed that interactions between temperature and dietary protein for consumption are relevant to M. sexta and other caterpillars that experience wide diurnal fluctuations in temperature in the held.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6962,,,,,DEC,1998,23,4,,,,,354,359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000077360300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the White Sea, S. spirorbis is distributed through the depth of 1-20 m and is affected by all varieties of fluctuations in salinity and temperature. C. spirillum lives in more wide range of depths 1-55 m and is more stenohaline. S. spirorbis larvae are sufficiently more resistant to the low salinity (10 parts per thousand) than C spirillum larvae. Both species are stenothermic. Highest survivorship of S. spirorbis larvae was marked under 5 degreesC in all experimental salinities. Under temperature treatments of 10-15 degreesC, the larval survivorship was sufficiently restricted in all salinities. Highest survivorship of C. spirillum larvae was also marked under 5 degreesC but in more narrow salinity range. The number of larvae undergoing metamorphosis in both species was very low, only about 10% of the total number. Highest number of successful attachments in both species was marked in high salinities (25-30parts per thousand) and does not exceed 25% of survivors.

These experiments were performed to develop an energy requirement prediction equation by using the comparative slaughter technique and the total excreta collection method. Regression equations were used to relate the energy intake, the energy retained in the body and eggs, and the heat production of the hens. These relationships were used to determine the daily ME requirement for maintenance, the efficiency energy utilization above the requirements for maintenance, and the NE requirement for maintenance. The requirement for weight gain was estimated from the energy content of the carcass, and the diet's efficiency energy utilization was determined from the weight gain, which was measured during weekly slaughter. The requirement for egg production was estimated by considering the energy content of the eggs and the efficiency of energy deposition in the eggs. The requirement and efficiency energy utilization for maintenance were 121.8 kcal ME/(kg(0.75).d) and 0.68, respectively. Similarly, the NE requirement for maintenance was 82.4 kcal ME/(kg(0.75).d), and the efficiency energy utilization above maintenance was 0.61. Because the carcass body weight and energy did not increase during the trial, the weight gain could not be estimated. The requirements for egg production requirement and efficiency energy utilization for egg production were 2.48 kcal/g and 0.61, respectively.

Newly emerged adults (tenerals) had mean T-th values during flight (34.5 degrees C; range 29-40 degrees C) that did not differ from their mean T-th,T-opt (34.6 degrees C; range 28.5-43.8 degrees C). Mature adults had higher and more precisely regulated thoracic temperatures (mean T-th 41.7 degrees C; range 37.5-45.2 degrees C), which were somewhat lower than their mean T-th,T-opt (43.6 degrees C; range 38.7-49.9 degrees C). Among matures, behaviors requiring the highest levels of flight exertion (aerial copulation; mate guarding; escalated territorial contests) caused an elevation of T-th above that of concurrently sampled individuals engaged in routine flight (mean T-th difference 1.3 degrees C), which raised mean T-th to a level that was not significantly different from T-th,T-opt (42.5 versus 43.5 degrees C). Compared with tenerals, matures spent more time flying, made longer-duration flights and showed a more restricted pattern of daily activity. Sympatric Anax junius dragonflies that regulate T-th endothermically had a uniform pattern of activity across the entire day, i.e. occupied a broader-ecological niche than that of L. pulchella.

Constant temperature incubation experiments have shown that for each of these species there is a pivotal temperature that produces a 1:1 sex ratio; higher temperatures bias sex ratios toward females, and lower temperatures toward males. Few studies have examined how fluctuating temperatures, as would be experienced in natural nests, affect hatchling phenotype. Models predict that under fluctuating temperatures sex determination depends on the proportion of development that occurs above or below the pivotal temperature. We tested the effect of fluctuating versus constant temperature incubation regimes on sex ratios and other hatchling traits for both painted and red-eared slider turtles. Eggs were divided into two treatments with half of the eggs from each species incubated at a constant intermediate temperature, 28.5 degrees C, and half incubated under temperatures that fluctuated 3 degrees C above and below 28.5 degrees C. We converted the fluctuating temperature data into a constant temperature equivalent (CTE) so that we could directly compare constant and fluctuating incubation regimes. The CTE for the fluctuating regime for both species was higher than the constant temperature, which would predict an increase in the production of females. The fluctuating regime did produce a higher proportion of females, but also resulted in increased developmental time and increased hatchling mass, indicating that fluctuating temperatures produce complex effects on hatchling phenotype.",,,,,"Paitz, Ryan T/A-8308-2008","Paitz, Ryan T/0000-0003-4609-4359",,,,,,,,,,,,,2471-5638,2471-5646,,,,MAY 1,2007,307A,5,,,,,274,280,,10.1002/jez.374,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.374,,,,,,,,17377950,,,,,WOS:000245872500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Each group was tested 3 times under each condition, for a total of 21 d, to assess the effects of varying climatic conditions ( outdoor temperature ranged from 9.9 to 28.2 degrees C and daily rainfall from 0 to 65 mm/d over the course of the experiment). When provided the choice, cows spent on average (+/- SD) 13.0 +/- 0.6 h/d on pasture, mainly at night. The time cows spent on pasture during the day decreased with the temperature-humidity index (R-2 = 0.55); time on pasture at night decreased with rainfall (R-2 = 0.12).

We tested the hypothesis that CO2 influences the functional response of epilithic and endolithic turf assemblages to increasing temperature. Replicate carbonate plugs covered by turf were collected from the reef and exposed to ambient and high pCO(2) (1000 A mu atm) conditions for 3 weeks. Each pCO(2) treatment was replicated across six temperatures (24.0-31.5 A degrees C) that spanned the full seasonal temperature range on a fringing reef in Moorea, French Polynesia, and included one warming treatment (3 A degrees C above daily average temperatures). Temperature and CO2 enrichment had complex, and sometimes interactive, effects on turf metabolism and growth. Photosynthetic and respiration rates were enhanced by increasing temperature, with an interactive effect of CO2 enrichment. Photosynthetic rates were amplified by high CO2 in the warmest temperatures, while the increase in respiration rates with temperature were enhanced under ambient CO2. Epilithic turf growth rates were not affected by temperature, but increased in response to CO2 enrichment. We found that CO2 and temperature interactively affected the endolithic assemblage, with the highest growth rates under CO2 enrichment, but only at the warmest temperatures. These results demonstrate how OA may influence algal physiology and growth across a range of ecologically relevant temperatures, and indicate that the effects of CO2 enrichment on coral-reef turf assemblages can be temperature dependent.

In this study, tolerance to freezing of vegetative and resting cells of 17 polar and nine temperate diatom strains, belonging to different morphospecies and originating from both freshwater and terrestrial habitats, was experimentally tested. Most strains were newly isolated from sites in Maritime Antarctica (James Ross Island and Vega Island), the High Arctic (Spitsbergen) and Europe. Cultures were exposed to five freezing treatments differing in temperature (-4, -20, -40 and -180 degrees C), freezing rate (gradual, abrupt), time (1 h, 12 h) and thawing rate (slow, fast). Results indicated that diatoms were sensitive to experimental freezing. Freezing temperatures had a significant effect on strain survival: all strains survived -4 degrees C; most survived -20 degrees C; five survived -40 and four of these (all belonging to the Pinnularia borealis complex) survived freezing in liquid nitrogen (-180 degrees C). The cooling and thawing rate had a significant impact on survival: abrupt cooling and slow thawing resulted in much lower survival rates than gradual cooling and fast thawing.

While the effects of thaw on the composition and activities of Arctic tundra microorganisms has been examined extensively, little is known about the consequences of temperature fluctuations within the subzero range in seasonally frozen or permafrost soils. This study identified tundra soil bacteria active at subzero temperatures using stable isotope probing (SIP). Soils from Kilpisjarvi, Finland, were amended with C-13-cellobiose and incubated at 0, -4 and -16 degrees C for up to 40 weeks. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of C-13-labelled DNA revealed distinct subzero-active bacterial taxa. The SIP experiments demonstrated that diverse bacteria, including members of Candidatus Saccharibacteria, Melioribacteraceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Armatimonadaceae and Planctomycetaceae, were capable of synthesising C-13-DNA at subzero temperatures. Differences in subzero temperature optima were observed, for example, with members of Oxalobacteraceae and Rhizobiaceae found to be more active at 0 degrees C than at -4 degrees C or -16 degrees C, whereas Melioribacteriaceae were active at all subzero temperatures tested. Phylogeny of C-13-labelled 16S rRNA genes from the Melioribacteriaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae and Candidatus Saccharibacteria suggested that these taxa formed subzero-active clusters closely related to members from other cryo-environments.

Although many extrinsic and intrinsic factors may generate variation in incubation temperature, they remain underexplored under natural conditions. Using a robust data set encompassing 55 nests, 22 816 behavioral observations, and > 1 million paired ambient and egg temperatures, we describe the relationships among abiotic factors, female incubation behavior, incubation temperature, and incubation period for tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor. We report a large amount of individual variation in incubation behaviors and average incubation temperatures for our study population. The average on-bout incubation temperature was 34.1 degrees C, with daily egg temperatures ranging from 18.0-39.2 degrees C. Females modulated the number of times they left the nest and the amount of time they stayed off the nest according to interactions between precipitation and temperature patterns. Models generated from our observations predicted that the number of female off-bouts was the lowest under warm and dry conditions while more off-bouts were taken under cold and dry or warm and wet conditions. During cold and dry conditions, females stayed off their nest approximate to 4 times longer than under warm and dry conditions. However, this pattern was reversed under periods of rainfall; females tended to take shorter off-bouts when it was rainy and cold compared to longer off-bouts during warmer rain events. Furthermore, variation in female behavior was associated with differences in overall incubation temperature such that females that maintained greater incubation constancy produced higher incubation temperatures at a given ambient temperature than those that displayed lower incubation constancy. Our results provide perspective on the timing of breeding, as some of the advantages of breeding early may be countered by cooler, early season temperatures and precipitation that cause reproducing females to favor self-maintenance at a potential cost to optimal incubation temperatures for offspring development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0908-8857,1600-048X,,,,JUL,2015,46,4,,,,,385,394,,10.1111/jav.00581,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.00581,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000357949300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The rates of leaf expansion and of cell division were analysed in leaves located at two positions on the stem, and a spatial analysis of expansion rate was carried out. Experiments were performed in growth chamber (stable conditions), in the field or in a greenhouse (fluctuating conditions). We compared three methods for characterizing the rate and the duration of expansion, Responses to leaf temperature were consistent only when expansion was characterized as a two-phase process - a period of exponential expansion (constant relative expansion rate, RER) followed by a decrease in RER, RER and relative cell division rate (RDR) responded linearly to temperature with a common response curve for all studied conditions. This response curve was also common to all studied zones within a leaf and to leaves at two positions on the stem. The reciprocals of the durations of the periods of exponential expansion, non-zero expansion and non-zero division were also linearly related to leaf temperature with common response curves in a given leaf zone, The x-intercepts of all these response curves and of the response curve of leaf initiation rate to temperature did not significantly differ in an analysis of covariance, with a common value of 4.8 degrees C. The expression of time in cumulative degree days, with a base temperature of 4.8 degrees C, resulted in a unique time course of RER and cell division rate regardless of temperature.

Ectotherms rely on behavioral and physiological plasticity to contend with environmental fluctuations. Nonetheless, our understanding of thermal plasticity has been largely limited to laboratory settings. Here, we test whether aspects of thermal physiology respond to interannual shifts in thermal environment in a natural population of Phrynosoma orbiculare, a montane horned lizard, from Hidalgo, Mexico. At our field site, 2019 was markedly warmer than the year that preceded it. We detected population-level increases in three key thermal physiological traits: preferred temperature, the critical thermal minimum, and the critical thermal maximum. Thus, thermal phenotypes appear to shift in tandem in response to environmental fluctuations. A subset of individuals were resampled across years, allowing insight into plastic shifts within an organism's lifetime. We detected parallel increases in these lizards for the preferred temperature and the critical thermal minimum, but not for the critical thermal maximum. Our results support a growing body of literature indicating that preferred conditions and cold tolerance can be highly labile over the course of an organism's lifetime, whereas hardening over shorter time periods is more common for heat tolerance. Given that heat tolerance increased at the population-level, but not in resampled individuals, it is possible that rapid evolution occurred due to temperature increases. In short, physiological shifts can be observed in natural populations over relatively short timespans, and these shifts might reflect a combination of evolutionary and acclimatory responses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2471-5638,2471-5646,,,,JAN,2021,335,1,,,,,136,145,,10.1002/jez.2403,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.2403,,AUG 2020,,,,,,32767500,,,,,WOS:000556177100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the extent of vector competence of Aedes japonicus (Theobald, 1901) is controversial. In this work, we elucidated the dynamics of virus growth in this invasive mosquito species. Females of Ae. japonicus were reared from eggs collected in the field in Switzerland and fed on bovine blood spiked with two WNV lineage 1 strains (FIN, Italy; NY99, USA). Fully engorged females were incubated for 14 days under a fluctuating temperature regime of 24 +/- 7 A degrees C (average 24 A degrees C), 45-90% relative humidity, which is realistic for a Central European mid-summer day. Infection, dissemination, and transmission rates were assessed from individual mosquitoes by analyzing the abdomen, legs and wings, and saliva for the presence of viral RNA. Saliva was also investigated for the presence of infectious virus particles. Overall, 302 females were exposed to WNV strain FIN and 293 to strain NY99. A higher infection rate was observed for NY99 (57.4%) compared to FIN (30.4%) (p = 0.003). There was no statistical evidence that the dissemination rate (viral RNA in legs and wings) was different between females infected with FIN (57.1%) compared to NY99 (35.5%) (p = 0.16). Viral RNA load of FIN compared to NY99 was significantly higher in the hemocoel (p = 0.031) of exposed females but not at other sites (legs and wings, saliva). This is the first study describing the vector competence parameters for two WNV strains in a European population of Ae. japonicus. The high dissemination and transmission rates for WNV under a realistic temperature regime in Ae. japonicus together with recent findings on its opportunistic feeding behavior (mammals and birds) indicate its potential role in WNV transmission in Central Europe where it is highly abundant.",,,,,"Torgerson, Paul R/M-4447-2013; Kurt, Tobler/ABA-2999-2020; Glavinic, Uros/S-5451-2019","Torgerson, Paul R/0000-0003-4277-9983; Glavinic, Uros/0000-0003-2143-1611; Veronesi, Eva/0000-0003-3411-7891",,,,,,,,,,,,,0932-0113,1432-1955,,,,JUN,2018,117,6,,,,,1925,1932,,10.1007/s00436-018-5886-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-018-5886-7,,,,,,,,29705877,,,,,WOS:000432128400028,View Full Record in Web of Science

The quahogs were subjected to high magnitude thermal fluctuations of the natural, declining temperature regime of a temperate estuary during the approach to winter. Inverse correlations emerged between mortality and dietary abundance of 20:5n-3 during the upper range of the temperature decline (18 degrees-12 degrees C), and 226n-3 during the lower range (12 degrees-6 degrees C), demonstrating their unique roles in supporting homeoviscous adaptation within each respective phase of thermal decline. High survival of a group whose diet was devoid of these n-3 fatty acids was associated with high molar S increases of enclogenic non-methylene-interrupted fatty acids, 22:2 Delta 7,13 and 22:2 Delta 7,15. Conversely in the current investigation, similarly grouped juvenile quahogs all experienced reductions in incorporated 22:2 Delta 7,13 and 22:2 Delta 7,15 when subjected to a mild temperature decrease of 0.2 degrees C per day, suggesting that high magnitude thermal fluctuation is a signal for the synthesis of non-methylene-interrupted fatty acids. The unfavorable circumstance of this group of quahogs deprived of dietary 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 was exacerbated by diminishing incorporation of these compounds and suffered the earliest and highest overall mortality of all dietary treatments. High early-phase mortality of this same group was associated with high levels of previously incorporated 22:6n-3, considered to be homeoviscously unfavorable at the upper thermal range above 12 degrees C, and this direct relationship fell neatly within the 95% confidence interval of a linear regression model established in the preliminary study. Statement of relevance: Results of this supplemental experiment provide novel correlations among thermal decline, diet and mortality of juvenile northern quahogs, distinct from the preliminary investigation cited in this paper. This work distinguishes the effects of absolute temperature decline and rapid decline on mortality of juvenile northern quahogs. This work also demonstrates the requirement of high magnitude thermal decline to signal the enclogenic biosynthesis of EPA, DHA and 22:2 NMIs in juvenile northern quahogs in homeoviscous adaptation to falling temperature. Results of this work can be applied to tailor supplemental diets of northern quahog seed to prepare for forecasts of rapid thermal decline. Such timely dietary supplementation may reduce loss of bivalve seed which might improve the industries annual production and profitability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Seed of T. grandiflorum were collected from the same population however of different trees at two occasions: February (lot 1) and April 2010 (lot 2). Seed germination was assessed at constant temperatures between 10 and 40 degrees C, with an interval of 5 degrees C. Three morphological criteria were evaluated: the protrusion (>= 5 mm) of the first visible structure (physiological criterion), epicotyl length (>= 3 cm; corresponding field emergence) and normal seedling development (technological criterion). The experimental design was completely randomized, with seven constant temperatures and four replicates with 25 seeds. For each criterion, germination percentage and variables of germination speed were assessed. In T. grandiflorum the hypocotyl is the first visible structure in the germination process. Its protrusion was observed between 10 and 40 degrees C in seed lot 1 and, in seed lot 2, between 10 and 35 degrees C. The lack of epicotyl growth and the development of normal seedlings at 10, 15 and 40 degrees C, in both seed collections, indicate that the shoot is more sensitive to extreme temperatures than the hypocotyl and root. The lower temperature limit for shoot growth was between 15 and 20 degrees C and the upper limit between 35 and 40 degrees C. The temperature of 30 degrees C is recommended for the germination test of T. grandiflorum. Observing normal seedling development, the first count could be done at day 21 and final count at day 35.

Particle image velocimetry is used to determine the turbulent and mean velocity fields, and a specially designed temperature probe with sensitive thermocouples is employed to measure the temperature field. We found that the ratio [(l(x)del(x)(T) over bar)(2) + (l(y)del(y)(T) over bar)(2) + (l(z)del(z)(T) over bar)(2)]/<theta(2)> is nearly constant, is independent of the frequency of the grid oscillations, and has the same magnitude for both, stably and unstably stratified turbulent flows, where l(i) are the integral scales of turbulence along x, y, z directions, (T) over bar and theta are the mean and turbulent fluctuations components of the fluid temperature. We demonstrated that for large frequencies of the grid oscillations, the temperature field can be considered as a passive scalar, while for smaller frequencies the temperature field behaves as an active field.

They are similar in morphology and habit and are sympatric over the southern portion of their ranges. Field observations suggest that temperatures of preferred natural habitat differ among these species. To determine whole-animal physiological differences associated with thermal aspects of their habitats, we quantified and compared maximum sprint speed at four ecologically significant temperatures. This study is unique among lizard studies due to the high degree of morphological similarity exhibited by these species, thereby allowing direct comparisons of locomotor performance responses to temperature that are not confounded by differences in morphology. As expected with diurnal lizards, the sprint speed of all three species increased significantly at the temperature interval that approximate the elevation of temperature from dawn to mid-day (20 degrees C to 25 degrees C). Additionally, P. inexpectatus was significantly faster than P. fasciatus and P. laticeps at the temperatures where these species generally would be active. Plestiodon laticeps exhibited a significantly lower sprint speed at 15 degrees C than the other two species. All species exhibited their fastest sprint speed at the highest experimental temperature. The temperature coefficient (Q(10)) for maximum locomotor performance across each 5 degrees C interval follow the same general pattern, with P. laticeps exhibiting a significantly higher Q(10) over the interval of 15 degrees C to 20 degrees C.

Though it is well-known that the flight performance is influenced by body temperature and body size, the relative importance of these factors is not well-understood. We performed laboratory experiments using the male-polymorphic damselfly Mnais costalis with larger territorial males and smaller non-territorial males in a population. We analyzed the effects of body temperature and body size, measured as the thoracic temperature and left hind-wing length, respectively, on two indices of flight performance: maximum lifting force and size-corrected lifting force. The latter is an index of acceleration that is related to aerial agility. The results showed that higher body temperature produced both larger maximum lifting force and larger size-corrected lifting force. In contrast, while larger size produced a larger maximum lifting force, it produced a lower size-corrected lifting force. The results of field measurements showed that territorial males had variable thoracic temperatures depending on the insolation in their territories. In contrast, non-territorial males had less variable and generally higher thoracic temperatures than territorial males as they are mostly found in sunny spots. Until now, the influence of body temperature on behavioral performance has remained unclear although considerable studies have suggested such influence. We showed, here, for the first time, combined effects of body size and body temperature on flight performance. We also showed that body temperature was influenced by the mating strategies of a damselfly. These findings provide new insights into the cost and benefits of territorial behavior in ectothermic animals.",,,,,"Kawata, Kyoko/E-4818-2010; Tsubaki, Yoshitaka/E-5300-2010",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,,,MAR,2010,64,4,,,,,685,692,,10.1007/s00265-009-0886-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-009-0886-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000274433600020,View Full Record in Web of Science

To tackle this question we have developed a dedicated, stochastic, spatial, individual-based model of the global bullhead population dynamics at the river network scale taking into account the influence of annual mean temperature. This article focused on the model description and its validation with experimental field data. We introduced temperature fluctuations and their impact on various demographics traits, such as growth, reproduction and survival. Several effect submodels were defined to describe these relationships, leading to a set of 40 parameters. The model was written in C++, and provided several population characteristics, such as individual numbers per age-class and network compartment over the course of time. The results were compared to experimental field data, and the model robustness was validated by a complete sensitivity analysis based on a cluster analysis followed by a co-inertia analysis. The population dynamics appeared to be mainly conditioned by changes in temperature, which had a particularly great impact on the juvenile survival rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The eggs received two treatments: (A) maintenance of water volume; (B) periodical and complete change of water. Blood meal was offered daily and it was interrupted after haematophagy and restarted after first oviposition. The immature development was significantly different under the temperature regimes (P < 0.05) and the increased temperatures positively affected the development speed. The combination of higher temperatures regime and periodical and complete change of water increased the eggs viability and shortened the incubation time. Adult longevity was not different between males and females and the mortality was regular through the time. Comparing the mosquito longevity under constant and cyclic temperatures, it is suggested that the lowest temperature of the cyclic regime is a limiting factor for mosquito survival.

The pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa is a Mediterranean pine defoliator, which typically lays eggs during the summer. We evaluated the effects of heat waves on egg mortality of three populations with different phenologies: a Portuguese population with a classical life cycle (eggs laid in summer), an allochronic Portuguese population reproducing in spring, and a Tunisian population from the extreme southern limit of T. pityocampa distribution range, in which eggs are laid in fall. We tested the influence of three consecutive hot days on egg survival and development time, using either constant (CT) or daily cycling temperatures (DT) with equivalent mean temperatures. Maximum temperatures (T-max) used in the experiment ranged from 36 to 48 degrees C for DT and from 30 to 42 degrees C for CT. Heat waves had a severe negative effect on egg survival when T-max reached 42 degrees C for all populations. No embryo survived above this threshold. At high mean temperatures (40 degrees C), significant differences were observed between populations and between DT and CT regimes. Heat waves further increased embryo development time.

The generation of the electric potential can be explained by the electrode potential, which depends on ion concentrations near electrodes. However, several different hypotheses about its periodic variations have been proposed, including streaming potential, ion diffusion, charge transport, and oxygen turnover. Here, we performed long-term measurements on the electric potential and water content in the xylem of trees, and observed changes in the electric potential and transpiration rate in response to varied numbers of leaves, light radiation, temperature, and relative air humidity. The electric potential showed a distinct seasonal trend, combined with daily rhythms, and could be affected by environmental changes. Rapid changes in the electric potential routinely lagged behind those of the transpiration rate, but their ranges of change were proportional. Both annual and diurnal patterns of the electric potential were synchronous with the trees' water content. Moreover, we found potential function relationships between the electric potential and water content. Accordingly, we propose a new perspective, that the variations of the electric potential in tree xylem could be associated with water content rhythms.",,,,,,"Hao, Zhibin/0000-0003-0953-6576",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,FEB 24,2021,72,4,,,,,1321,1335,,10.1093/jxb/eraa492,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eraa492,,,,,,,,33098428,,,,,WOS:000637289700028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Species-specific and treatment-specific differences in leaf temperature, high-temperature tolerance and chlorophyll a fluorescence from photosystem II were compared, to test the hypothesis that plants at ecosystem borders will exhibit species-specific responses to climate change. Measurements were made for plants ex posed to a climate change warming manipulation on a major ecosystem border at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, Colorado, United States, in July and Au gust 1995. In July, daily maximal leaf temperatures were significantly higher for P. gracilis than for A. tridentata. Leaf temperatures were slightly lower in August than July for leaves of both species, on control and heated plots, despite the fact that daily maximum air temperatures were not significantly different for the two months. High-temperature tolerance was determined for leaves treated for 1 h at temperatures ranging from 15 degrees C to 65 degrees C. LT(50) was approximately 46 degrees C for both species on control plots, but was 43 degrees C for leaves of both species from heated plots, contrary to the predictions of the hypothesis. No shift in LT(50) (acclimation) was apparent between July and August. Changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence from photosystem II (F-V/F-M) were used to characterize the photosynthetic response to high temperatures. For both A. tridentata and P. gracilis in July, F-V/F-M was about 0.7, but decreased for temperatures above 40 degrees C.

To test this hypothesis, we assessed the survival capacities of vegetative cells of 34 benthic diatom species from terrestrial and aquatic habitats in Belgium when exposed to desiccation and temperature stress. Six different stress conditions were studied: gradual heating up to +30 degrees C and +40 degrees C, abrupt heating to +40 degrees C, freezing. to -20 degrees C and desiccation with and without preconditioning at +30 degrees C. All six conditions resulted in a significantly decreased survival of cells compared to control conditions. Desiccation killed all tested strains, freezing was survived by only three species and abrupt heating was significantly more lethal than gradual heating, suggesting a generally high sensitivity of vegetative diatom cells to these three stress factors. While tolerance to temperature extremes (+40 degrees C and -20 degrees C) was to a large extent species-specific, habitat-specific differences in cell survival were also detected. Only terrestrial species survived freezing, and aquatic diatoms were less tolerant to gradual heating to +40 degrees C, both pointing at a higher tolerance of terrestrial diatoms to temperature extremes. Moreover, in two species with both aquatic and terrestrial isolates, only the terrestrial strains survived +40 degrees C. We conclude that vegetative cells of benthic diatoms (1) are very sensitive to desiccation, freezing and abrupt heating and (2) have a habitat-dependent tolerance to temperature extremes.

The analysis shows that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) value of Ta is similar to 0.5 degrees C for all products. TropFlux captures the daily variability of Ta very well, but it has a systematic deviation in Ta. The large drop in Ta observed during intense rainfall events is very well captured by TropFlux. All products overestimate Qa by 0.3-1.5 g/kg; OAFlux has the smallest systematic deviation, whereas TropFlux has the highest correlation with buoy data. The overestimation of Qa by the products is mainly caused by high values of Qa, in the range of 18-22 g/kg. The RMSE of Qa ranges from 0.92 to 1.79 g/kg, with OAFlux having the lowest values. Latent heat flux (LHF) computed from a bulk algorithm is underestimated by all products, which can be primarily attributed to the positive bias in Qa. In the southern Bay of Bengal, LHF decreases with increasing Qa during winter and summer monsoons. In this region, a change in 1 g/kg Qa can cause about 11-15 W/m(2) errors in LHF.

To cope with cold environments, the freshwater turtle, Trachemys scripta, exhibits inverse thermal compensation, where physiological processes exhibit exaggerated Q(10) effects and are actively downregulated to limit energy requirements. The present study aimed to identify potential sites of temperature sensitivity in mitochondria from the turtle heart. The effect of acute temperature change on ADP sensitivity and respiratory flux through different components of the electron transport chain (Complexes I, I and IV) was analysed in permeabilized cardiac fibres from the turtle ventricle. An acute decrease in temperature significantly reduced the acceptor control ratio and maximum respiration rate (M-O2) through all complexes of the electron transport chain. Calculated Q(10) values for M-O2 across the three experimental temperatures tested (5, 13 and 21 degrees C) were in the range of 1.19-3.65, and although there was a tendency for exaggerated Q(10) values in the lower temperature range (5-13 degrees C), there were no significant differences in Q(10) between any temperatures or complexes examined. These results suggest the large-scale reductions in turtle cardiac function and high Q(10) values at acutely low temperatures are likely due to a reduction in energy demand (contractile function), rather than supply (mitochondrial respiration).

The emphases in this study were to (i) develop effective mechanisms for integrating meteorological ensemble systems into hydrologic forecasts; and (ii) evaluate the skill and economic values of the subsequent hydrologic forecasts. The general framework was demonstrated under a number of conditioning paradigms for the Chute-du-Diable watershed located in Quebec, Canada. For this purpose, two downscaling models were employed to generate station total daily precipitation and average daily temperature. The performances of the downscaled outputs were compared against the raw model output using suites of diagnostic measures. The comparative results indicated that the downscaled outputs yielded more accurate and realistic forecasts than the raw model output. These outputs were then forced into an HBV hydrologic model in order to generate flow forecasts up to 14 days ahead. The approach effectively generated deterministic and probabilistic flows. The subsequent simulation results revealed that the downscale-based flows yielded greater skill values than the raw-based flows. The potential economic values of flow forecasts were assessed based on a simple optimal decision-making, cost-loss analysis technique. The principal outcomes emerging from the analyses include: (i) the economic benefits associated with probabilistic flow forecasts were more useful than their deterministic counterparts; and (ii) the downscale-based flow forecasts offered greater benefits, which are applicable to a much wider range of users, than the raw-based flow forecasts. The findings of the present study clearly illustrate the potential added value that may be obtained as a result of adequate downscaling, as opposed to using the raw model output, for hydrologic applications.

However, plants grown under DLI inc produced the same leaf area as those grown under DLI10 at week 8. Nonetheless, across weeks, growth was significantly less under DLIInc compared with DLI10 , but similar to that produced by DLI8 at week 8. Photosynthetic responses were significant only at week 8, for which leaves of plants grown under DLI8 , DLI10, and DLIInc had 15% to 25% greater maximum gross carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation (A(max)) than plants grown under DLI4. The light saturation point of photosynthesis was unaffected by DLI, but showed a general increasing trend with greater DLIs. Overall, our results suggest that providing a constantly high DLI results in greater growth and yield than increasing the DLI over time. In addition, we found that changes in A max and the light saturation point are not good indicators of the capacity of whole plants to make use of the available light for photosynthesis and growth.

The measured population structure in conjunction with an updated bioenergetic model was used to estimate daily predation demands by Bythotrephes on the zooplankton community. The bioenergetic model incorporated the effect of temperature on growth and respiration and used a scalable size structure to adjust for a dynamic range in size across the season. A general linear model was developed to apply the bioenergetic results to routinely collected field data for estimating predation needs. Daily population consumption needs were estimated to be approximately equal to Bythotrephes standing biomass but varied as a function of water temperature and percent instar composition. At a temperature of 18 degrees C the predation needs of the population were equal to the population biomass. At warmer temperatures (22-24 degrees C) the daily needs were up to 35% above the population biomass. Within and across years the population was variable, while trend lines from the long-term data indicated biomass and predation needs had an initial peak in mid-August followed by a plateau period with a seasonal high peak mid-October.

However, direct field comparisons of energy expenditure and torpor use in hibernating and active free-ranging animals are scarce. Here, we followed the complete hibernation cycle of a fat-storing hibernator, the marsupial Dromiciops gliroides, in its natural habitat. Using replicated mesocosms, we experimentally manipulated energy availability and measured torpor use, hibernacula use, and social clustering throughout the entire hibernation season. Also, we measured energy flow using daily food intake, daily energy expenditure (DEE), and basal metabolic rate (BMR) in winter. We hypothesized that when facing chronic caloric restriction (CCR), a hibernator should maximize torpor frequency to compensate for the energetic deficit, compared with individuals fed ad lib. (controls). However, being torpid at low temperatures could increase other burdens (e.g., cost of rewarming, freezing risks). Our results revealed that CCR animals, compared with control animals, did not promote heat conservation strategies (i.e., clustering and hibernacula use). Instead, they gradually increased torpor frequency and reduced DEE and, as a consequence, recovered weight at the end of the season. Also, CCR animals consumed food at a rate of 50.8 kJ d(-1), whereas control animals consumed food at a rate of 98.4 kJ d(-1). Similarly, the DEE of CCR animals in winter was 47.3 & PLUSMN;5.64 kJ d(-1), which was significantly lower than control animals (DEE=88.0 & PLUSMN;5.84 kJ d(-1)). However, BMR and lean mass of CCR and control animals did not vary significantly, suggesting that animals maintained full metabolic capacities. This study shows that the use of torpor can be modulated depending on energy supply, thus optimizing energy budgeting. This plasticity in the use of heterothermy as an energy-saving strategy would explain the occurrence of this marsupial in a broad latitudinal and altitudinal range. Overall, this study suggests that hibernation is a powerful strategy to modulate energy expenditure in mammals from temperate regions.",,,,,"Fontúrbel, Francisco E./C-7756-2009","Fontúrbel, Francisco E./0000-0001-8585-2816",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,1537-5293,,,,JAN 1,2022,95,1,,,,,66,81,,10.1086/717760,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/717760,,,,,,,,34875208,,,,,WOS:000730905100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data from the constant temperature conditions were used to determine the coefficients of the egg quality prediction models, which consisted of the primary model controlling the change rate of the quality indicator at a temperature condition in differential equation form, and the secondary model controlling the change rate with temperature, which was in quadratic polynomial form. The models were applied to the data from the fluctuating temperature conditions, and the zeroth, third, and eighth order kinetic models described the stepwise change in the RWL, HU, and YI, respectively.

To better understand the temperature tolerance, growth, and stress physiology of native redband trout populations and compare the resilience and responses to reciprocal environments of stocks adapted to desert or montane conditions, we conducted controlled laboratory trials. We tested groups of age-0 progeny from naturally reproducing desert and montane fish stocks in temperature cycles that simulated the summer conditions typical in regional desert and montane stream habitats. The diel cycles ranged from 8 degrees C to 16 degrees C for montane treatments and from 18 degrees C to 26 degrees C for desert treatments, and our tests were repeated over 2 years. We evaluated survival, growth, feed efficiency, plasma cortisol, heat shock protein levels, and body proximate composition in samples of fish collected during and at the completion of the trials. All of the stocks tested had high survival under all conditions, regardless of their geographic origin. We found no differences consistently attributable to desert or montane origin. Growth rates and protein and lipid efficiencies varied among stocks, between temperature treatments, and between replicate years. We found that the expression of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) was consistently higher in all stocks maintained at desert temperatures regardless of source, but the absolute quantity of proteins measured varied among populations. We conducted an additional short-term trial to evaluate the responses of different stocks to upper lethal temperature cycles that approached a daily maximum of 30 degrees C. Although desert-and montane-adapted populations of redband trout were equally dynamic and adaptive in desert or montane diel temperature cycles, we conclude that the desert stocks will be more at risk from increasing temperatures and reduced stream flows in the summer months as climate changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,MAR,2010,139,2,,,,,339,352,,10.1577/T08-247.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T08-247.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000277125100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study is an attempt to understand how this plant adapts to wet habitats and high altitudes. Specifically, we examined the effects of cold stratification, light, GA(3), KNO3, and temperature on P. beesiana seed germination. KNO3 and GA(3) increased germination percentage and germination rate compared to control treatments at 15/5 and 25/15 degrees C. Untreated seeds germinated well (> 80%) at higher temperatures (20, 25 and 28 degrees C), whereas at lower (5, 10 and 15 degrees C) and extremely high temperatures (30 and 32 degrees C) germination decreased significantly. However, after cold stratification (4-16 weeks), the germination percentage of P. beesiana seeds at low temperatures (5-15 degrees C) and the germination rate at high temperatures (30 degrees C) increased significantly, suggesting that P. beesiana has type 3 non-deep physiological dormancy. The base temperature and thermal time for germination decreased in seeds that were cold stratified for 16 weeks. Cold-stratified seeds incubated at fluctuating temperatures (especially at 15/5 degrees C) had significantly high germination percentages and germination rates in light, but not in dark, compared to the corresponding constant temperature (10 degrees C). Seeds had a strict light requirement at all temperatures, even after experiencing cold stratification; however, the combinations of cold stratification and fluctuating temperature increased germination when seeds were transferred from dark to light. Such dormancy/germination responses to light and temperature are likely mechanisms that ensure germination occurs only in spring and at/near the soil surface, thus avoiding seedling death by freezing, inundation and/or germination deep in the soil.

Overall, females selected lower body temperatures when pregnant (mean = 32.0 degrees C) than when postpartum (mean = 33.5 degrees C). 3. Females regulated body temperature more precisely when pregnant than when postpartum as judged by their smaller variances in body temperature throughout the day. 4. When pregnant, females selected a lower mean maximum body temperature (mean: pregnant = 32.8 degrees C; postpartum = 34.5 degrees C) than when postpartum, but selected mean minimum body temperatures did not differ. 5. None of the experimental temperature treatments was detrimental to pregnant females. Female body length increased during pregnancy but the rate of increase did not differ among treatments. Moreover, length-adjusted body mass of postpartum females did not differ among treatments. 6. Pregnant females that experienced postpartum body temperatures produced neonates that were smaller in body mass and length than pregnant females that experienced pregnant body temperatures and females that were allowed to thermoregulate. 7. For neonates resulting from the postpartum body temperature treatment, the disparity in the body length, but not mass, was still observed at 9 days of age, although survival and growth of neonates was high and did not differ among treatments. 8.

Laboratory studies have demonstrated that food shortage alone can trigger the use of heterothermy. However, their potential to predict heterothermic responses in the wild is limited, and few field studies demonstrate the dependence of heterothermy on food availability under natural conditions. Thus, the view of heterothermy as an energy saving strategy to compensate for food shortage largely remains an untested hypothesis. In this paper, we review published evidence on the proximate role of food availability in heterothermy regulation by endotherms, and emphasize alternative hypotheses that remain to be tested. Most studies have relied on correlative evidence. Manipulations of food availability, that demonstrate the proximate role of food availability, have been conducted in only five free-ranging heterotherms. Several other metabolic constraints covary with food availability and can confound its effect. Shortage in water availability, the nutritional composition of food, or subsequent conversion of food in fat storage all could be actual proximate drivers of heterothermy regulation, rather than food shortage. Social interactions, competition for food and predation also likely modulate the relative strength of food shortage between individuals. The ecological relevance of the dependence of heterothermy on food availability remains to be assessed in field experiments that account for the confounding effects of covarying environmental and internal factors.",,,,,"VUARIN, Pauline/ABA-8657-2021; Henry, Pierre-Yves/G-3139-2013; VUARIN, Pauline/AAG-7290-2022; VUARIN, Pauline/AES-9500-2022","Henry, Pierre-Yves/0000-0003-2255-7347; VUARIN, Pauline/0000-0002-0997-0228; VUARIN, Pauline/0000-0002-0997-0228",,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,1432-136X,,,,AUG,2014,184,6,,,,,683,697,,10.1007/s00360-014-0833-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-014-0833-0,,,,,,,,24850375,,,,,WOS:000339886800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, a novel house-hold VRF based radiant A/C system adopting outdoor air dehumidifier (OAD) was developed and experimentally tested. This novel system employed the VRF system, applying one refrigerant cycle to the OAD to cooling and dehumidifying the outdoor air and another to the Refrigerant-Water plate heat exchanger (RWPHE) to providing chilled water for the adopted radiant terminals. Therefore, the supplying outdoor air from the OAD handled the indoor latent cooling load and the radiant terminals the indoor sensible load, so as to realize the independent control of indoor air temperature and humidity. Experiments were carried out at different outdoor air states for examining the performance of this novel THIC system. The experimental results showed that the supply air temperatures were controlled at proper levels with a moderate fluctuation below 2 degrees C and the supply air humidity ratios were within 8-10 g/kg, meeting the requirement of ASHRAE's recommendation.

Additionally, to mimic tidal variation, we used five tidal depth treatments for germination experiments in mesocosm. In mesocosm tanks, there was a wide range of daily fluctuating temperature at datum line +40 cm (17-25 degrees C), DL +20 cm (15 degrees C), and D.L +0 cm (4-7 degrees C). In contrast, the maximum temperature range at D.L -20 cm and -40 cm was narrow (5-6 degrees C). In the no cold stratification group, the maximum germination rates on sandy, muddy sand, and muddy bottom sediment were 3%, 11%, and 3%, respectively. In the cold stratification group (7 degrees C), the maximum germination rates were 40%, 53%, and 54%, respectively. First germination was observed 36 0 days and 43 6 days after the start of the germination experiment in the cold stratification group and the no cold stratification group, respectively. Bottom sediment type and tidal level did not affect seed germination in the both stratification group. Cold stratification strongly increases germination in all sediment types tested and under varying temperature regimes and at different tidal levels. We also tested whether seed germination is affected by daily fluctuations in temperature (10 degrees C constant, 15 degrees C/10 degrees C, and 20 degrees C/10 degrees C were compared) in an indoor incubator. Forty-two days after being sown, the maximum seedling emergence rates in the three groups were 3 +/- 5%, 21 +/- 7%, and 42 +/- 26%, respectively.

It is possible that high temperature has a negative impact on gametogenesis of S. intermedius. We investigated digestion, somatic and gonad growth, and gonad development of adult S. intermedius from the Rebun Island from June to September 2011. Experimental temperature treatments were: monthly average (CT, 11.2-19.9 degrees C), high (HT, 13.4-22.7 CC), and low (LT, 10.5-18.2 degrees C). These temperatures represent the temperature range of the last 30 years in the island. At the highest temperature in late August, digested kelp dry matter in HT was lower than in LT. Body weight in CT and LT increased significantly during the experiment. Testicular development in CT and LT progressed to the spent stage in late September, but remained at the partly spawned stage in HT. Ovaries in CT and LT developed to the premature, partly spawned, or the spent stage, from early to late September, a time when ovarian development in HT progressed from the premature to the partly spawned stages, although some ovaries retained the growing stage, indicating that oogenesis was suppressed. In CT and LT, oocyte area increased significantly from early to late August, when ovaries developed from the growing to the premature stages, due to initiation of oogenesis. In contrast, in late July, oocyte area in HT was significantly larger in CT and LT, which might be due to increased digested kelp dry matter and digestibility, which enable resources to accumulate for gametogenesis at < 20 T. Oocyte area in HT was significantly smaller in late August and in early September, reflecting delayed ovarian development, but it rapidly increased from early to late September, when kelp digestibility increased, possibly due to decreased temperature, which enables animals to compensate for delayed oocyte growth leading to oogenesis. Low gonad growth in HT, and delayed maturation and spawning would be the causal factor of decreased juvenile recruitment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,APR,2020,525,,,,,,,,151324,10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151324,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000520951000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Iris pseudacorus, an emergent macrophyte, has established invasive populations across a broad global range, and reduces biodiversity in wetland ecosystems. Climate change is altering germination cues, yet studies on the invasion of wetland macrophytes often ignore germination ecology despite its importance to their establishment and spread. Methods We explored germination of seeds from invasive I. pseudacorus populations in California in response to seed coat presence or absence, and several environmental factors. Using experimental results in a thermal time model, we derived germination temperature thresholds. Results Germination of I. pseudacorus seeds did not require cold or warm stratification, and was not affected by seed coat presence or absence. Germination occurred in the dark, although germinability was two- to threefold times greater under light. At constant temperature, thermal time model estimates included 18.3 +/- 1.8 degrees C base germination temperature ( T b $({T}_{b}$); 28.2 +/- 0.5 degrees C optimal temperature ( T o $({T}_{o}$); and 41.0 +/- 1.7 degrees C ceiling temperature ( T c $({T}_{c}$). Seeds exposed to 36.0 degrees C achieved over 10% germination, and embryos of ungerminated seeds presented 76% viability. Overall, germinability remained relatively low at constant temperatures (<= 25%) but was close to 90% under alternating daily temperatures.

Two raster-based models of resolution 250 m were constructed to identify suitable habitat (species distribution model) and to estimate site index (productivity model) for beech in the Cantabrian Range. Of the 23 variables retained in the spatial distribution model, climate, soil and terrain were the most important (explaining respectively 51.2%, 34.2% and 10.1% of the variation). The productivity model retained only three variables (percentage of silt in soil, mean diurnal range of temperature and plan curvature of the terrain) but was able to explain 54% of the total variation. Future projections based on two emission scenarios suggest that suitable habitat will be drastically reduced by 2070 (loss of 40-90% of the area for the moderate and pessimistic scenarios, respectively). However, the projections do not imply current population removal rather it can be probably interpreted in less favorable conditions for seedling establishment, higher mortality rates and a reduction in local density of populations. Productivity projections for suitable habitat suggest a large increase in the average site index (from current 15.19 to 18.18 m) in the moderate scenario and an increase of only 34 cm in the pessimistic scenario. The study findings provide basic information for conservation biology and could be used by decision-makers to develop and implement actions for mitigating the impact of climate change on beech forests.",,,,,"Marcos, Barrio-Anta/F-3472-2016; López-Sánchez, Carlos A./K-6486-2016","Marcos, Barrio-Anta/0000-0001-5626-7853; López-Sánchez, Carlos A./0000-0002-5135-5739; Castano-Santamaria, Javier/0000-0002-2978-5599",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1127,1872-7042,,,,OCT 15,2019,450,,,,,,,,117488,10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117488,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2019.117488,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000484651100014,View Full Record in Web of Science

For reconstruction stability, we introduce anomaly inpainting network, which does not directly complete missing SSTs but estimates the difference between the unobserved SSTs and the average SSTs. SSTs do not fluctuate much over a few days; thus, we can use recent average SSTs as a rough estimation of SSTs and can assume that the SST difference will be within a specific range.

In this study, four management systems are compared for determining management-induced changes in soil temperature at different depths: (i) conventional tillage (T-C) with the standard rate of N fertilizer (P1N1), (ii) conventional tillage with the half-standard rate of N fertilizer (P1N0), (iii) reduced tillage (T-R) with the standard rate of N fertilizer (P0N1), and iv) reduced tillage with the half-standard rate of N fertilizer (P0N0). Temporal analysis of soil temperature is assessed to examine data observed at a specific time to achieve a better understanding of the soil temperature dynamic that occurs at different time scales. The results showed that the soil temperature has decreasing amplitudes and increasing phase shifts with increasing soil depth, i.e., the deeper the measurement depth, the smoother the soil temperature changes cycle and the smaller the variability. Results showed that the diurnal temperature variation is found up to 45 cm depth of soil whereas annual temperature variation is up to a depth of 180 cm. The results, moreover, revealed that soil temperature dynamic was affected by tillage systems and fertilization and a time lag is observed between the temperature fluctuations at the surface and deeper layers, due to induced management effects on plant cover, residues, and soil properties. Although higher soil temperature at the sowing stage under TR is contributed to higher amounts of surface crop residues in crop rotations, the effect of residues on soil temperature variation reduces with an increase in percent plant cover and shading of soil, which happens in the last stage of plant growth. At the last stage of crop development regardless of tillage systems, applying more N fertilization increased crop yield, resulting in cooling soil temperature.",,,,,,"Franko, Uwe/0000-0002-1516-4003; Jarrah, Mahboube/0000-0001-6811-6892",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2073-4395,,,,MAY,2022,12,5,,,,,,,1199,10.3390/agronomy12051199,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12051199,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000803417600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Germination of cranberry seeds produces off-type varieties that are generally characterized by lower fruit productivity and higher vegetative vigor. Over time, the productivity of cranberry beds decreases as off-type frequency increases over time. Improved knowledge of cranberry germination biology would facilitate the use of targeted agronomic practices to reduce the emergence and growth of less productive off-types. The influences of light, temperature regime, pH, and water potential on cranberry seed germination were assessed in a growth chamber, whereas the effect of seeding depth on seedling emergence was evaluated in a greenhouse. Seeds stratified for 6 months at 3 degrees C were used for these experiments. Cranberry germination was influenced by light quality, with maximum germination reaching 95% after 15 minutes of exposure to red light but decreasing to 89% under far-red light. However, light was not required for inducing germination. Cranberry seeds germinated over a range of alternating diurnal/nocturnal temperatures between 5 and 30 degrees C, with an average maximum germination of 97% occurring for diurnal temperatures of 20 to 25 degrees C. The length of emerged seedlings was reduced by an average of 75% for pH 6 to 8 compared with pH 3 to 5. Seedlings that emerged at pH greater than 5 showed increasing chlorotic and necrotic injuries and were not considered viable at pH 7 or 8. Germination at 15 degrees C was reduced when seeds were subjected to water stress as low as -0.2MPa, and no germination occurred below -0.4MPa. Seeds incubated at 25 degrees C were more tolerant to water stress, with at least 70% maximum germination for osmotic potential (psi(S)) -0.6 MPa or greater. The average seedling emergence was 91% for seeds left on the soil surface or buried at a maximum depth of 1 cm; however, it was null at a burying depth of 4 cm. These results indicate that germination of cranberry seeds in cultivated beds in the northeastern United States likely occurs during the summer months, when temperatures are optimal and the moisture requirement is supported by irrigation. However, timely application of residual herbicide or sanding (a traditional cranberry agronomic practice) of open areas in cranberry beds could help prevent seed germination and reduce minimizing the onset of off-type varieties.",,,,,"BESANCON, THIERRY/N-1808-2016","BESANCON, THIERRY/0000-0003-0194-9675",,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-5345,2327-9834,,,,SEP,2021,56,9,,,,,1089,1096,,10.21273/HORTSCI15971-21,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI15971-21,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000695776000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Implications for TIR remote sensing measurements,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Atmospheric turbulence in both surface (SBL) and planetary (PBL) boundary-layers govern rapid temporal fluctuations of the surface temperature (Ts), with potentially important resulting errors on instantaneous satellite measurements in the thermal infrared (TIR). An experiment designed to evaluate the error, and its reduction with spatial resolution (expected from ergodicity properties), of Ts is described. It is based on the analysis of time series of Ts at different resolutions reconstructed from sequences of images acquired at high frequency using a helicopter borne TIR camera over 5 different surfaces in the south-west of France, in the 2010 summer. Unfortunately the non-respect of a stationary flight resulted in a contamination of the data by directional effects; the filtering process developed to correct for this also eliminated the signature of low frequency PBL turbulence related to Is measurements, and made only possible the study of high frequency turbulence impact on Ts. For decreasing resolution (i.e., increase in pixel size), the contribution of the SBL turbulence to error rapidly decreases with resolution (i.e., pixel size increase); it reaches +/- 0.5 degrees C at 50 m, the resolution selected for recent spatial mission projects, with only little variations thereafter. Recommendations are made for future experiments to evaluate the overall error induced by atmospheric turbulence on satellite Ts measurements.

The nitrate concentration in the surface water in the RS plot, where the residence time was 2 days, decreased more than the concentration in the control or RSC plots. The total estimated nitrate removal from each plot in relation to the other plots was RS > RSC = control. Measurements of the soil from each plot on 29 February 2008 showed that incorporation of RS significantly increased the denitrification potential, even at low temperatures (5-10 degrees C).

The annual runoff ratio (discharge divided by precipitation) increased about 0.1 per 300 m of mean catchment elevation over the range 1,800-2,400 m. Higher-elevation catchments have lower vegetation density, shallow soils with rapid permeability, and a shorter growing season when compared with those at lower elevations. Average annual temperatures ranged from 6.8 degrees C at 2,400 m to 8.6 at 1,950 m elevation, with annual precipitation being 75-95% snow at the highest elevations vs. 20-50% at the lowest. Peak discharge lagged peak snow accumulation on the order of 60 days at the higher elevations and 20 to 30 days at the lower elevations. Snowmelt dominated the daily streamflow cycle over a period of about 30 days in higher elevation catchments, followed by a 15-day transition to evapotranspiration dominating the daily streamflow cycle. Discharge from lower elevation catchments was rainfall dominated in spring, with the transition to evapotranspiration dominance being less distinct. Climate warming that results in a longer growing season and a shift from snow to rain would result in earlier runoff and a lower runoff ratio.",,,,,,"Hunsaker, Carolyn/0000-0002-5662-2402",,,,,,,,,,,,,1093-474X,,,,,AUG,2012,48,4,,,,,667,678,,10.1111/j.1752-1688.2012.00641.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2012.00641.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000307014000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The radiometer has been applied successfully to detect the atmospheric supercooled water content. Although the auto-gain compensative technique can compensate the gain fluctuation to keep the radiometer's stability by measuring the output variation of reference noise source, it also introduces measurement error caused by the physical temperature change of the reference noise source. For this reason, a temperature correction method for the output voltage of this radiometer is proposed. The corrected equations are derived by using the regression relationship between the measurement error and the physical temperature of the reference noise source. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this method, the outdoor contrast experiment was carried out. For the 30 degrees antenna channel, the RMSE of the two-point calibration method is 2.039K while the RMSE of the correction method is 0.718K. For the 90 degrees antenna channel, the RMSE of the two-point calibration method is 2.113K while the RMSE of the correction method is 0.448K.

Impacts of climate change on biological aspects of such communities are increasingly studied, but impacts on the chemicals that mediate key interactions of biofilm organisms have largely been overlooked. Acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), crucial bacterial signals within biofilms, are known to degrade through pH and temperature-dependent hydrolysis. However, the impact of climate change on AHLs and thus on biofilm form and function is presently unknown. This study investigates the impact of changes in pH and temperature on the hydrolysis rate, half-life time and quantitative abundance of different AHLs on daily and seasonal timescales for current conditions and future climate change scenarios.We established the mathematical relationships between pH, hydrolysis rates/half-life times and temperature, which revealed that natural daily pH-driven changes within biofilms cause the greatest fluctuations in AHL concentration (up to 9-fold). Season-dependant temperature enhanced or reduced the observed daily dynamics, leading to higher winter and lower summer concentrations and caused a shift in timing of the highest and lowest AHL concentration by up to two hours. Simulated future conditions based on climate change projections caused an overall reduction of AHL degradation and led to higher AHL concentrations persisting for longer across both the daily and seasonal cycles.This study provides valuable quantitative insights into the theoretical natural dynamics of AHL concentrations. We highlight critical knowledge gaps on the scale of abiotic daily and seasonal fluctuations affecting estuarine and coastal biofilms and on the biofilms' buffering capacity. Detailed experimental studies of daily and seasonal dynamics of AHL concentrations and assessment of the potential implications for a suite of more complex interactions are required. Substantial fluctuations like those we show in this study, particularly with regards to concentration and timing, will likely have far reaching implications for fundamental ecosystem processes and important ecosystem services such as larval settlement and coastal sediment stabilisation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,AUG 1,2022,9,,,,,,,,882428,10.3389/fmars.2022.882428,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.882428,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000844646900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study evaluated probabilistic postprocessing approaches, including the nonhomogeneous Gaussian regression (NGR), affine kernel dressing (AKD), and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) techniques, for improving daily and weekly ET0 forecasting based on single or multiple numerical weather predictions (NWPs) from the THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE), which includes the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS), and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO) forecasts. The approaches were examined for the forecasting of summer ET0 at 101 US Regional Climate Reference Network stations distributed all over the contiguous United States (CONUS). We found that the NGR, AKD, and BMA methods greatly improved the skill and reliability of the ET0 forecasts compared with a linear regression bias correction method, due to the considerable adjustments in the spread of ensemble forecasts. The methods were especially effective when applied over the raw NCEP forecasts, followed by the raw UKMO forecasts, because of their low skill compared with that of the raw ECMWF forecasts. The post-processed weekly forecasts had much lower rRMSE values (between 8% and 11 %) than the persistence-based weekly forecasts (22 %) and the post-processed daily forecasts (between 13% and 20 %). Compared with the single-model ensemble, ET0 forecasts based on ECMWF multimodel ensemble ET0 forecasts showed higher skill at shorter lead times (1 or 2 d) and over the southern and western regions of the US. The improvement was higher at a daily timescale than at a weekly timescale. The NGR and AKD methods showed the best performance; however, unlike the AKD method, the NGR method can post-process multimodel forecasts and is easier to interpret than the other methods. In summary, this study demonstrated that the three probabilistic approaches generally outperform conventional procedures based on the simple bias correction of single-model forecasts, with the NGR post-processing of the ECMWF and ECMWF-UKMO forecasts providing the most cost-effective ET0 forecasting.",,,,,,"Tian, Di/0000-0001-7752-947X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1027-5606,1607-7938,,,,MAR 3,2020,24,2,,,,,1011,1030,,10.5194/hess-24-1011-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1011-2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000518794800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the second group, the thermal insulation thickness complies with the value recommended by a national building energy standard. Weather data from four cities in Mexico with a warm climate were used as boundary conditions for the exterior surface of the roofs. The computational tool consisted of a numerical model based on the finite volume method, which was validated with experimental data. A series of comparative simulations was developed, taking a gray roof as the control case. The results demonstrated that white roofs without insulation had an exterior surface temperature between 11 and 16 degrees C lower than the gray roof without insulation. Thus, the daily heat gain of these white roofs was reduced by a factor ranging between 41 and 54%. On the other hand, white roofs with insulation reduced the exterior surface temperature between 17 and 21 degrees C compared to the gray roof with insulation. This temperature reduction caused insulated white roofs to have a daily heat gain between 37 and 56% smaller than the control case. Another contribution of this research is the assessment of two retrofitting techniques when they are applied at once.

In Australian cotton production systems, events where the minimum daily temperature falls below this value are referred to as 'cold shocks'. The number of cold shocks is used by growers and advisors in assessing retardation of crops in their areas. However, this effect has not been tested explicitly. The aim of this work was to empirically assess effects of cold shock on pre-flower development of cotton plants. Cotton seedlings were grown in controlled-temperature glasshouses. Plants were transferred to cold chambers ranging from 5 to 22degreesC during the night period for durations from 3 to 10 days. Negative effects were not seen until plants had been exposed to at least 10 nights at 10degreesC, or for at least 5 nights at 5degreesC. When differences were generated it did not delay development to first square any more than 4 days, nor was the effect consistent. These differences translated into delays to first flower, but had little effect on plant morphology, or on dry weight measured soon after flowering. In one experiment, a significant reduction in leaf photosynthesis was measured at two times of day on the day after cold shock at 5degreesC.

Offshore reefs of the Florida Keys, USA, experience milder temperatures and lower nutrient loads in comparison to inshore reefs yet remain considerably more degraded than nearshore patch reefs. A year-long reciprocal transplant experiment of the mustard hill coral (Porites astreoides) involving four source and eight transplant locations reveals that corals adapt and/or acclimatize to their local habitat on a <10-km scale. Surprisingly, transplantation to putatively similar environmental types (e.g., offshore corals moved to a novel offshore site, or along-shore transplantation) resulted in greater reductions in fitness proxies, such as coral growth, than cross-channel transplantation between inshore and offshore reefs. The only abiotic factor showing significantly greater differences between along-shore sites was daily temperature range extremes (rather than the absolute high or low temperatures reached), providing a possible explanation for this pattern. Offshore-origin corals exhibited significant growth reductions at sites with greater daily temperature ranges, which explained up to 39% of the variation in their mass gain. In contrast, daily temperature range explained at most 9% of growth variation in inshore-origin corals, suggesting that inshore corals are more tolerant of high-frequency temperature fluctuations. Finally, corals incur trade-offs when specializing to their native reef. Across reef locations the coefficient of selection against coral transplants was 0.07 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE). This selection against immigrants could hinder the ability of corals to recolonize devastated reefs, whether through assisted migration efforts or natural recruitment events, providing a unifying explanation for observed patterns of coral decline in this reef system.",,,,,"Matz, Mikhail V/K-4392-2017","Matz, Mikhail V/0000-0001-5453-9819; Kenkel, Carly/0000-0003-1126-4311",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,DEC,2015,96,12,,,,,3197,3212,,10.1890/14-2297.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/14-2297.1,,,,,,,,26909426,,,,,WOS:000367287900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fish were ponded on February 26; each treatment group had three replicates of 250 fish. Mean temperatures for the entire experiment were 12.3 degrees C for all tanks with a total of 1348 and 1341 degree days for the constant temperature and oscillating temperature tanks, respectively. Daily fluctuation in temperature averaged 7.5 degrees C in the variable temperature groups and less than 1 degrees C for the constant temperature group. Starting on April 5, bentonite clay was added each day to tanks as a pulse event to achieve a suspended sediment concentration of 200 mg l(-1); clay cleared from the tanks within approximately 8 h. Fish were sampled at approximately two week intervals from ponding until mid-June. On the last sample date, June 12, a single gill arch was removed and fixed for histological examination of gill morphology. By early May, significant differences were seen in size between the groups; control>temperature=sediment>(temperature x sediment). This relationship was consistent throughout the experiment except for the last sample date when the temperature group had a mean weight significantly greater than the sediment group. Gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity was not affected by daily temperature oscillations, but groups subjected to increased suspended sediment had significantly lower enzyme activities compared to controls. Mean cell size for gill chloride cells did not differ between groups. Plasma cortisol increased significantly during the spring, but there were no significant differences between groups.

Although models suggest increased risk of species extinction up to the year 2050 for series of different climate change scenarios, environmental complexity may result in unconsidered effects of future temperature alterations on ecosystems. Apart from these environmental changes, additional anthropogenic stressors, e.g. chemical release, may cause unprecedented interaction effects on ecosystems. Ongoing efforts to better understand such temperature-chemical interaction effects comprise almost exclusively experimental designs using constant temperature regimes instead of environmentally realistic daily temperature variations. In this paper we describe an Arduino-based temperature and heatwave control device (TENTACLE) that is transportable, inexpensive, multifunctional, and easily reproducible. TENTACLE offers water temperature monitoring and manipulation of up to 3 different climate change-related scenarios: i) natural (ambient) sinusoidal fluctuations (laboratory applications), ii) elevated fluctuations, and iii) heatwaves as extreme events. The use of replaceable heating elements and lowcost materials suitable for field studies creates a high flexibility for researchers who may conduct in- or out-door, small- or large-scale, fresh- or salt-water experiments at different geographical locations.

Adaptation is the only option to reduce the impacts. However, before starting determining adaptation strategies, it is important to conduct scientific research to understand possible pathways of future climate change under different emission scenarios. This is essential for having scientific facts that would guide the formulation of effective adaptation strategies. In this study, climate change projections for Tanzania is carried out using outputs of high resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment program (CORDEX). Future (2011-2100) projections of daily rainfall, minimum and maximum temperatures under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 are compared with baseline (1971-2000) simulations. The comparison is based on determining the departure of future climate during present (2011-2040), mid (2041-2070) and end (2071-2100) centuries from baseline (1971-2000) climate condition. Results reveal that there are likely to be an obvious increased minimum and maximum temperature trend over the entire country in three future periods (2011-2040), (2041-2070), and (2071-2100) under both emission scenarios RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5. This is especially true for the western parts of the country, southwestern highlands and the eastern parts of Lake Nyasa where maximum temperatures are projected to be greater than 3.5 degrees C and in the range of 2 to 2.4 degrees C under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios respectively. The western sides of the Lake Victoria basin and parts of Northeastern highlands are likely to feature increased minimum temperatures in the range of 4.5 to 4.8 degrees C under RCP 8.5 emission scenario. The cold season: June-July-August-September (JJAS) is likely to become warmer than the warm season that starts from October and continue to April or May. During JJAS season, the country is likely to experience increased maximum temperature in the range of 1.7 to 2.4 degrees C and 2 to 4 degrees C in mid (2041-2070) and end (2070-2100) centuries respectively. Rainfall over parts of northeastern highlands and Coastal regions is projected to increase in the range of 0.5 to 1 mm/day and 0.25 to 0.5 mm/day under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios respectively.

In the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus), an Australian lizard with TSD, data from nests in the field demonstrate that offspring sex ratios are predictable from thermal fluctuations but not from mean nest temperatures. To clarify this paradox, we incubated eggs in a factorial experiment with two levels of mean temperature and three levels of diel fluctuation. We show that offspring sex is determined by an interaction between these critical thermal parameters. Intriguingly, because these two thermal descriptors shift in opposing directions throughout the incubation season, this interactive effect inhibits seasonal shifts in sex ratio. Hence, our results suggest that TSD can yield offspring sex ratios that resemble those produced under genotypic sex-determining systems. These findings raise important considerations for understanding the diversity of TSD reaction norms, for designing experiments that evaluate the evolutionary significance of TSD, and for predicting sex ratios under past and future climate change scenarios.",,,,,,"Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,JAN 22,2011,278,1703,,,,,256,265,,10.1098/rspb.2010.1040,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2010.1040,,,,,,,,20685704,,,,,WOS:000285085600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fluctuations around the optimal temperature were always negative for the adult survival under starvation. The effect of thermal fluctuations on the number of offspring reaching adulthood was negative as well but increased with the extent of exposure. It was the strongest when the adult parents were kept and the offspring were raised under fluctuating temperatures. However, the later the offspring were exposed to fluctuations during their development, the weaker the effect of fluctuating temperatures was. Moreover, raising the parents under fluctuating temperatures but keeping them after pupation at constant temperatures fully alleviated the negative effects of fluctuations on the offspring. Finally, we demonstrate that keeping the parents a few days under fluctuating temperatures is required to induce negative effects on the number of offspring reaching adulthood.

Laboratory-bred voles (n = 5-6 for both species) were equipped with intra-abdominal data loggers that registered T-b every 10 min and were subjected to 12-h fasting periods during photophase and scotophase. In addition, 10 animals of both species were placed in outdoor cages at natural ambient temperature (T-a) and their T-b was registered at 3-h intervals between October and June. Fasted voles did not enter torpor, but the average 24-h T-b decreased by 0.2-0.5 degrees C in winter, yielding modest energy savings. The decrease in the T-b correlated with T-a but not photoperiod and could, thus, be interpreted as a response to cold.

However, little is known about the long-term effects of environmental perturbations on the production and maintenance of these secondary sex characteristics in avian species. In zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), redder beaks indicate increased carotenoid expression and implantation into beak tissue, and female zebra finches prefer males with pronounced bright red beaks as a mate. The present study examines the long-term effects of embryonic incubation temperature on the maturation of beak color in zebra finches. We also investigated the effects of embryonic incubation temperature on sensitivity to a handling and restraint stressor in adulthood. Specifically, the aims of this study were to examine: (1) whether suboptimal incubation temperatures affect the timing of beak color development and color characteristics before and after sexual maturity, (2) if repeated handling causes short-term changes in beak color and whether color changes are related to embryonic thermal environment, and (3) how thermal stress during incubation alters future responses to a repeated handling stressor. Zebra finch eggs were randomly assigned to one of three incubators: Control, Low, or Periodic Cooling. Beak color (hue, saturation, and value) was quantified before [45, 60, 75 days post-hatch (dph)] and after sexual maturity (95 dph), as well as after repeated handling stress later in adulthood (avg of 386 dph). We found that there were age- and sex- specific effects of incubation treatment on beak hue, where females from periodically cooled eggs had decreased hues (redder) in adulthood. Additionally, eggs laid later in a clutch had decreased beak saturation levels throughout life regardless of incubation environment. We found that females had lower beak hue and saturation following a capture and restraint stressor, while males showed increased beak saturation. Lastly, males subjected to the Low incubation treatment had relatively higher activity levels during restraint than those in the Control group. Overall, these findings suggest that fluctuating incubation temperatures combined with repeated, short-term stressors can have significant, sex-specific effects on sexual ornamentation and behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,JUN 24,2022,10,,,,,,,,901303,10.3389/fevo.2022.901303,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.901303,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000823033100001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Sanford, E",,,,"Sanford, E",,,"The feeding, growth, and energetics of two rocky intertidal predators (Pisaster ochraceus and Nucella canaliculata) under water temperatures simulating episodic upwelling",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although most upwelling regions are marked by strong fluctuations in water temperature, few studies have examined how episodic cold-water events affect the physiology and ecology of benthic marine invertebrates. I tested the hypothesis that upwelling-related variation in water temperature regulates the feeding, growth, and energetics of two rocky intertidal predators, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus (Brandt, 1835) and the whelk Nucella canaliculata (Duclos, 1832). Sea stars and whelks were maintained in laboratory tanks at a constant 9 degreesC, a constant 12 degreesC, and a treatment that simulated the Oregon coast upwelling regime by cycling between 14-day periods of 12 and 9 degreesC. Early in the experiments, sea stars and whelks held at 9 degreesC consumed about 30% fewer mussels (Mytilus trossulus) than those in warmer tanks. Despite lower consumption by whelks in colder tanks, 9 and 12 degreesC individuals attained the same final size. Similarly, sea stars in 9 degreesC tanks showed greater growth per gram of mussel tissue consumed than individuals held at 12 degreesC. These results suggest that reduced consumption under colder conditions was balanced by reduced metabolic costs. Moreover, there appeared to be an energetic advantage to living in the temperature regime characteristic of intermittent upwelling. Sea stars alternately exposed to 12 and 9 degreesC had a significantly higher growth rate, conversion efficiency, and storage of reserves in the pyloric caeca than individuals in the constant 12 degreesC tanks. Whelks maintained under fluctuating temperatures tended to grow faster than those held at constant 12 or 9 degreesC, although this trend was not statistically significant (p=0.069). These results suggest that benthic consumers experiencing cyclic temperatures may feed intensely during periods of warmer water while benefiting from reduced metabolic costs during cold-water intrusions. Because the fecundity of Pisaster and Nucella is a function of energy stored during the upwelling season, interannual variability in upwelling patterns could alter the reproductive output of these species.

This suggested that EOD-cooling promoted both floral differentiation and development in carnation.

Because environmental factors could affect variation, correlations between the diurnal temperature range and the difference in each survey component were examined using regression analyses. Moderate (days to flowering) and a strong (node order of flowering) correlations were found with the diurnal temperature range. Thus, the EOD-cooling treatment was advantageous in suppressing delayed flowering over a large diurnal temperature range during floral differentiation.

Blue crabs have evolutionary origins in the tropics, although they currently inhabit temperature estuaries that exhibit major fluctuations in diurnal. monthly, and seasonal environmental conditions. Therefore, harsh winter conditions in Chesapeake Bay are a potentially important source of blue crab stock loss. However, this variable has been largely unexamined. To assess the effects of variation in winter environmental conditions on blue crab survival, we measured winter morality of crabs in the field and conducted laboratory experiments to test the interactive effects of low temperature, salinity, and blue crab life stage. Field studies indicated that blue crabs suffered relatively low winter morality rates (<= 3%) during five out of eight winters, when bottom water temperature in February was at or above the 8-year average (3.4 degrees C). However, in years when bottom water temperature fell below the February average, annual mortality rates rose to 6.0-14.5%. Mortality rates were highest in the coldest regions of Chesapeake Bay, and larger crabs and female crabs were most vulnerable to these stressful conditions. Similarly.. in the laboratory, mortality was highest in the lowest temperature (1 degrees C) and salinity (8 ppt) treatments. Mature females were more sensitive to winter conditions than juvenile crabs. Of the juvenile life stages, recruits (< 15 mm carapace width) were least tolerant to winter conditions. These results indicate that temperature, salinity, and blue crab life stage are important variables in predicting survivorship over winter months.

Seed germination and vigor by plot replication were evaluated in Petri-dishes incubated over a thermal gradient ranging from 12 to 36 degrees C at approximately 1.0 degrees C increments. Growing degree day (GDD) accumulation for each temperature increment was calculated based on daily mean temperature measured by thermocouples. Lorentzian distribution models were used to establish the temperature and time (hours) to maximum germination. With respect to maximum germination and temperature; Georgia-07W (23.9 degrees C) < Florida-07 (25.0 degrees C) < Georgia Greener (25.2 degrees C) < Georgia-06G (25.3 degrees C) = Tifguard < Georgia Green (26.4 degrees C) < Georgia-09B (27.1 degrees C) = Georgia-02C. Nonlinear regression indices from logistic growth curves with three parameters were used to elucidate seed germination by cultivar. These data included maximum indices of germination for each cultivar by year establishing parameter estimates using nonlinear regression, GDD value at 80% germination (Germ80), and temperature required by each cultivar for optimum germination. Peanut cultivar vigor varied by year with respect to overall GDDs to reach Germ80 and maximum germination (b(0)). Ranking of cultivars by GDD to reach Germ80 were: Georgia Green < Georgia-02C < Georgia-06G = Georgia Greener < Georgia-09B < Georgia-07W < Tifguard < Florida-07. This indicates that Georgia Green had much greater vigor than Florida-07 over the course of the experiments. Georgia-06G peanut seed were consistent with respect to germination, Germ(80), and b(0).

The central methodological issues of this debate relate to the proper treatment of normalised temperature anomalies and trends in the studied time series which may be difficult to separate from time-evolving fluctuations. Some argue that temperature variability is indeed increasing globally, whereas others conclude it is decreasing or remains practically unchanged. Meanwhile, a consensus appears to emerge that local variability in certain regions (e.g. Western Europe and North America) has indeed been increasing in the past 40 years. Here we investigate the nature of connections between external forcing and climate variability conceptually by using a laboratory-scale minimal model of mid-latitude atmospheric thermal convection subject to continuously decreasing 'equator-to-pole' temperature contrast Delta T, mimicking climate change. The analysis of temperature records from an ensemble of experimental runs ('realisations') all driven by identical time-dependent external forcing reveals that the collective variability of the ensemble and that of individual realisations may be markedly different - a property to be considered when interpreting climate records.",,,,,"Borcia, Ion Dan/D-1132-2017","Borcia, Ion Dan/0000-0003-1092-5755",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,MAR 21,2017,7,,,,,,,,254,10.1038/s41598-017-00319-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-00319-0,,,,,,,,28325927,,,,,WOS:000396847900015,View Full Record in Web of Science

To better understand the characteristics of the organic soil that make Canadian Shield rock barrens suitable turtle nesting habitat, we measured moisture retention and evaporative potential and calculated the thermal properties of lichen (Cladonia) mats and moss (Sphagnum and Polytrichum) cushions, as well as their underlying mineral-organic soils. The upper soil profile consisted almost entirely of low density (14-49kgm(-3)), high porosity (72-98%) organic matter (loss on ignition [LOI] of 84-99%), which transitioned rapidly to comparatively high density (304-815kgm(-3)) mineral-organic soil (LOI of 10-85%). In contrast to Sphagnum and Cladonia, under laboratory conditions, Polytrichum was able to maintain an evaporation rate well above the open-water potential for several days during a drying experiment. Overall, contrasts in composition and water retention between soil layers are likely to dampen diurnal temperature fluctuations. However, differences in potential water loss between species will have a direct impact on soil thermal dynamics, particularly if substantial water loss occurs in the mineral-organic layer. Because soil depth and temperature regulation by moisture content and soil composition are an important component of nesting habitat, this research provides evidence for the need to conserve moss/lichen-dominated habitats within turtle species' home ranges.

We compare melt variability with nearby air temperature and stream discharge to show that the new CETB product allows detection of hydrologic processes in mountainous watersheds.

J,"Reid, JB",,,,"Reid, JB",,,Yield response to nutrient supply across a wide range of conditions - 1. Model derivation,FIELD CROPS RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is a strong need for quantitative advice on fertiliser rates for annual crops. There is also need for a method to estimate the degree to which nutrient availability is limiting yields in a wide variety of field experiments. Such information would greatly increase the confidence with which generalisations can be made from experimental results. Detailed mechanistic simulation models are often ill-suited for calculations that span a wide range of field conditions. Such models may need large amounts of site-specific soil and crop details, and can be difficult to validate at the level at which they ostensibly simulate the processes involved. An alternative approach is to use semi-mechanistic or empirical models that predict yield on the basis of response curves for fertiliser applications and soil nutrient content at planting. While these can be very reliable within their calibration range, they generally lack the ability to cope with changes in factors such as the weather, plant population or cultivar. This paper derives PARJIB, a model that: (1) retains the functional simplicity and modest data requirements of response curve-style empirical models; (2) provides a meaningful framework for interpreting field experiments; (3) can be used in a very wide range of conditions. In PARJIB, yield response to nutrient supply is dictated by the maximum yield, which is the potential yield (driven by climate and cultivar characteristics) adjusted for plant population and water stress. Emphasis is placed on scaling both the nutrient supply and the simulated crop yield relative to the maximum yield. Interactions between the effects of different nutrients are simulated using a simple equation that combines the effects of nutrients in less than optimal supply. The model can be calibrated against field measurements of crop performance. This is readily achieved using a genetic algorithm technique, although other non-linear fitting techniques may be used. Calibration requires information on maximum or potential yield (usually calculated from daily air temperature, rainfall/irrigation, and radiation), fertiliser and irrigation applications, potential evapotranspiration, and soil information (estimates of available water capacity and soil chemical analyses such as Olsen P, exchangeable K, etc.). Provided they are consistent within a calibration dataset, a wide range of techniques may be used for the soil chemical analysis, although the calibration produced is specific to the actual techniques used. Performance of the model for maize (Zea mays L.) is described in the second paper of this series. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The plants were grown for 9 days at 10 or 25 degrees C RZT. Mineral nutrients other than CaSO4 were supplied daily in exponentially increasing amounts to meet the demand of the plants. Al was added as Al-2(SO4)(3) at the beginning of the culture period at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 mu M. pH was kept constant at 4.1. Experimental data were analysed for interactions between Al and RZT on a fresh weight basis by the nonlinear Weibull function. Cultivar Kadett, when grown at 25 degrees C RZT, was more resistant to Al than when grown at 10 degrees C RZT. Cultivar WW 20299 was equally sensitive to Al at 10 and 25 degrees C RZT but generally more sensitive to Al than cv. Kadett. It is suggested that cv. Kadett, in contrast to cv. WW 20299, possesses a mechanism for Al resistance that is less effective at 10 degrees C than at 25 degrees C RZT and therefore may be metabolically dependent. In roots, the concentrations of K, P, Mg and Ca were not negatively affected by Al or by RZT. In shoots of both cultivars the concentrations of Ca and Mg became comparatively low when the plants were treated with Al or at low RZT, the effect being larger for Ca than for Mg. At 10 degrees C RZT under Al stress, the Ca concentrations in shoots approached the critical concentration where growth may be inhibited. As no Al was detected in the shoots, it is suggested that Al in the roots inhibits shoot growth by reducing transport of Ca from roots to shoots.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-9317,,,,,MAY,1996,97,1,,,,,5,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UM60400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In early spring we observed newly emerged Drosophila subobscura, which had overwintered as larvae and pupae. As temperatures increase during spring these flies are faced with higher minimum and maximum temperatures in their natural microhabitat Thus, there is a potential costly mismatch between winter and early spring acclimatization and the increased ambient temperatures later in adult life. We obtained individuals from a natural Danish population of D. subobscura and acclimated them in the laboratory to 20 degrees C for one generation, and compared critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) to that of individuals collected directly from their natural microhabitat The two populations (laboratory and field) were subsequently both held in the laboratory at 20 degrees C and tested for their CTmax and CTmin every third day for 28 days. At the first day of testing, field acclimatized D. subobscura had both higher heat and cold resistance compared to laboratory flies, and thereby a considerable larger thermal scope. Following transfer to the laboratory, cold and heat resistance of the field flies decreased over time relative to the laboratory flies. Despite the substantial decrease in thermal tolerances the thermal scope remained larger for field acclimatized individuals for the duration of the experiment. We conclude that flies acclimatized to their natural microhabitat had increased cold resistance, without a loss in heat tolerance. Thus while a negative correlation between cold and heat tolerance is typically observed in laboratory studies in Drosophila sp., this was not observed for field acclimatized D. subobscura in this study. We suggest that this is an adaptation to juvenile overwintering in temperate cold environments, where developmental (winter) temperatures can be much lower than temperatures experienced by reproducing adults after emergence (spring). The ability to gain cold tolerance through acclimatization without a parallel loss of heat tolerance affects thermal scope and suggests that high and low thermal tolerance act through mechanisms with different dynamics and reversibility.

There have been few assessments of how soil fungal biomass is affected by climate; however, a good understanding of how soil mycelium is correlated with climate is essential to predict long-term responses to global warming. Soil extramatrical mycelia (EMM) of Lactarius vinosus, a highly valued and edible ectomycorrhizal species, was quantified by performing qPCR analyses of soil samples that were collected monthly from 28 long-term experimental plots. The belowground moisture and temperature of these plots were individually recorded every 2 h. L vinosus soil EMM biomass fluctuated between 44 and 261 kg ha(-1), with the maximum biomass occurring during spring months and the minimum occurring during winter and summer months. Mean mycelial turnover was estimated to occur 7.0 times year Soil EMM was reduced under low soil temperatures and when there was a combination of high soil temperatures and low soil moisture, most likely caused by reduced C allocation from the host under both winter and summer conditions. Preliminary models using simulated reductions in soil moisture and increases in soil temperature showed that soil EMM increased significantly during winter spring months, whereas EMM decreased significantly during summer months.

Changes in freshwater inflow are expected to affect salinity patterns in the bay, so the effect of salinity and temperature on the growth, survival, and subsequent recruitment and harvest of this ecologically and economically important species was examined with laboratory experiments and a simulation model. Experiments were conducted to determine the response of juvenile growth and survival to temperature (15degreesC to 33degreesC) and salinity (2parts per thousand to 55parts per thousand), and results were used to refine an existing model. Results of these experiments indicated that juvenile pink shrimp have a broad salinity tolerance range at their optimal temperature, but the salinity tolerance range narrows with distance from the optimal temperature range, 20-30degreesC. Acclimation improved survival at extreme high salinity (55parts per thousand), but not at extremely low salinity (i.e., 5parts per thousand, 10parts per thousand). Growth rate increases with temperature until tolerance is exceeded beyond about 35degreesC. Growth is optimal in the mid-range of salinity (30parts per thousand) and decreases as salinity increases or decreases. Potential recruitment and harvests from regions of Florida Bay were simulated based on local observed daily temperature and salinity. The simulations predict that potential harvests might differ among years, seasons, and regions of the bay solely on the basis of observed temperature and salinity. Regional differences in other characteristics, such as seagrass cover and tidal transport, may magnify regional differences in potential harvests. The model predicts higher catch rates in the September-December fishery, originating from the April and July settlement cohorts, than in the January-June fishery, originating from the October and January settlement cohorts. The observed density of juveniles in western Florida Bay during the same years simulated by the model was greater in the fall than the spring, supporting modeling results. The observed catch rate in the fishery, a rough index of abundance, was higher in the January-June fishery than the July-December fishery in most of the biological years from 1989-1990 through 1997-1998, contrary to modeling results and observed juvenile density in western Florida Bay.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0160-8347,,,,,DEC,2002,25,6B,,,,,1355,1371,,10.1007/BF02692230,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02692230,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000180611400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is of particular importance for temperate prawn fisheries in South Australia that target the semi-tropical western king prawn Penaeus (Melicertus) latisulcatus. P. latisulcatus resides at its lower temperature limit in South Australia, where it is restricted to the warmer waters of the gulf and embayment systems. Duration and survival were determined for three larval stages of P. latisulcatus reared at constant temperatures: 17, 20, 22.5 and 25 degrees C. Data were subsequently used to construct a larval development model to generate predictions of larval duration for varying hatch dates when water temperature was within spawning range (November-May) at two different spawning grounds within Spencer Gulf (north vs. south). Results demonstrated that water temperature had affected larval development, duration and subsequently total survival. A power relationship was found between temperature and larval duration such that lower temperatures exerted the greatest influence. Under a constant laboratory temperature regime, total larval development ranged from 12.7 days (at 24.4 degrees C) to 31.3 days (at 17.1 degrees C). Stage-specific duration was generally greatest for protozoea, while developmental variability among individuals was greatest at later stages and at higher temperatures. Daily survival (similar to 98% day(-1)) was similar between 17 degrees C (total end survival: 36%) and 25 degrees C (total end survival: 74%) treatments, suggesting the upper thermal tolerance limit is greater than mean water temperature maxima in temperate Spencer Gulf. A seasonal larval duration model predicted total duration to be shorter at the beginning of the spawning season (26.8 days: 9 November) due to increasing daily water temperatures, compared to later in the season (35.4 days: 29 May). Furthermore, larval duration was predicted to be significantly shorter in warmer northern (minimum 12.7 days) compared to southern (minimum 17.2 days) spawning grounds. These results improve the understanding of the factors that affect larval dispersal, settlement and recruitment of P. latisulcatus. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The acquisition of viviparity (live-bearing reproduction) has emerged as one such innovation explaining reptile proliferations into extreme climates. By evolving viviparity, females provide embryos with internally stable environments to complete development. The classical hypothesis suggests that natural selection for viviparity arises from low temperatures in cold climates, which promote prolonged egg retention in the mother's body. An alternative hypothesis proposes that declines in atmospheric oxygen at high elevations create natural selection for embryo retention to provide them with optimal oxygen levels during development. However, although experimental studies support the negative effects of low oxygen on egg development, this hypoxia' hypothesis has never been tested quantitatively. Here, we compete the hypoxia hypothesis against the cold-climate' hypothesis, using a highly diverse lizard genus. Location: South America. Major taxa: Liolaemus lizards. Methods: We use a multivariate dataset covering 121 species varying extensively in geographical and climatic distribution (including extreme thermal and oxygen gradients) and parity mode. Based on a new molecular phylogeny for the genus, we use phylogenetic logistic regressions to generate a range of models ranking environmental factors as a function of their effects on parity mode transitions. Results: Elevation and oxygen declines were almost perfectly correlated, and both were identified as the dominant predictors of oviparity-to-viviparity transitions, whereas the role for temperature (dominated by the coldest winter temperatures and daily fluctuations) was significant but secondary. Overall, we showed that oxygen deprivation and low temperatures both play a role in the evolution of viviparity. Main conclusions: Our findings support the role for selection from declines in oxygen concentrations as the primary driver behind viviparity. However, selection arising from cold temperatures and from reduced fluctuations in daily temperatures contributes to the evolution of these transitions by creating multivariate selection on parity mode.",,,,,,"Saldarriaga-Cordoba, Monica/0000-0002-4768-4919; Pincheira-Donoso, Daniel/0000-0002-0050-6410; Garcia-Roa, Roberto/0000-0002-9568-9191",,,,,,,,,,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,NOV,2017,26,11,,,,,1238,1246,,10.1111/geb.12626,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12626,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000413906800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Genetic variation for this process is therefore important for adaptation. This study investigates the genetic response to temperature fluctuations during stem elongation and its relationship to phenology and height. Canopy height of 315 wheat genotypes (GABI wheat panel) was scanned twice weekly in the field phenotyping platform (FIP) of ETH Zurich using a LIDAR. Temperature response was modelled using linear regressions between stem elongation and mean temperature in each measurement interval. This led to a temperature-responsive (slope) and a temperature-irresponsive (intercept) component. The temperature response was highly heritable (H-2=0.81) and positively related to a later start and end of stem elongation as well as final height. Genome-wide association mapping revealed three temperature-responsive and four temperature-irresponsive quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Furthermore, putative candidate genes for temperature-responsive QTLs were frequently related to the flowering pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas temperature-irresponsive QTLs corresponded to growth and reduced height genes. In combination with Rht and Ppd alleles, these loci, together with the loci for the timing of stem elongation, accounted for 71% of the variability in height.

To generate the multimodel ensembles, we implement a new statistical postprocessor, namely, quantile regression-Bayesian model averaging (QR-BMA). Quantile regression-Bayesian model averaging uses quantile regression to bias correct the ensemble streamflow forecasts from the individual models and Bayesian model averaging to optimally combine their probability density functions. Additionally, we use an information-theoretic measure, namely, conditional mutual information, to quantify the skill enhancements from the multimodel forecasts. We generate ensemble streamflow forecasts at lead times from 1 to 7days using three hydrological models: (i) Antecedent Precipitation Index-Continuous, (ii) Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model, and (iii) Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological modeling system. As forcing to the hydrological models, we use weather ensemble forecasts from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2. The forecasting experiments are performed for four nested basins of the North Branch Susquehanna River, USA. We find that after bias correcting the streamflow forecasts from each model, their skill performance becomes comparable. We find that the multimodel ensemble forecasts have higher skill than the best single-model forecasts. Furthermore, the skill enhancements obtained by the multimodel ensemble forecasts are found to be dominated by model diversity, rather than by increased ensemble size alone. This result, obtained using conditional mutual information, indicates that each hydrological model contributes additional information to enhance forecast skill.

Large ranges of PPFD and soil temperature were obtained in a series of field and growth chamber experiments, In the field, the growth of root systems experiencing day-to-day natural fluctuation of PPFD and temperature was followed, and some of the plants under study were shaded, In the growth chamber, plants experienced contrasting and constant PPFDs and root temperatures, The direct effect of apex temperature on individual root elongation rate was surprisingly low in the range 13-25 degrees C, except for the first days after germination. Root elongation rate was essentially related to intercepted PPFD and to distance to the source, both in the field and in the growth chamber. Branch appearance rate substantially varied among days and environmental conditions. It was essentially linked to taproot elongation rate, as the profile of branch density along the taproot was quite stable. The length of the taproot segment carrying newly appeared branches on a given day was equal to taproot elongation on this day, plus a 'buffering term' which transiently increased if taproot elongation rate slowed down. The proportion of branches which stopped elongating a short distance from the taproot ranged from 50-80% and was, therefore, a major architectural variable, although it is not taken into account in current architectural models, A set of equations accounting for the variabilities in elongation rate, branch appearance rate and proportion of branches which stop elongating, as a function of intercepted PPFD and apex temperature is proposed.

Bat boxes with a suitable thermal behaviour can provide alternative roosts. However, this is particularly difficult to achieve in hot climates, where boxes may overheat. We studied roost temperatures and roost thermal preferences of this bat in attics and roofs in a Mediterranean region. Roosts reached high temperatures, experienced great thermal fluctuations and had wide spatial thermal ranges. Bats preferred the warmest locations within roosts, indicating that they are a heat tolerant species. However, they avoided temperatures of 40 degreesC and above, suggesting that this is the upper limit of the species thermally neutral zone. The study of experimental sets of white, grey and black boxes demonstrated that the latter were the ones that most often reached the temperatures observed in roosts in buildings. They were also the ones occupied by larger numbers of bats. These results suggest that, even in hot Mediterranean climates, black boxes are the best option as alternative roosts for evicted colonies. However, on particularly hot days, bats left them, suggesting that black boxes could be improved by creating a wider thermal range. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This suggests that the tolerance of temperature and salinity of brittle stars is closely related to their living environment, and that the effects of temperature on oxygen consumption are more significant at higher salinity, and that the ammonia excretion is less affected by salinity at lower temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1672-5182,1993-5021,,,,JUN,2015,14,3,,,,,549,556,,10.1007/s11802-015-2513-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11802-015-2513-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000354403700019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effects of different exposure temperatures on physiological processes of S. clava were measured at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees C. The impact of temperature on energy balance at a whole organism level was then assessed by scope for growth (SFG) and net growth efficiency (K-2) measures. Physiological rates of S. clava were well correlated with its dry tissue weight (DW). Positive allometry with DW indicated that all physiological rates investigated were generally higher in the larger individuals regardless of temperature. Some allometric equations (e.g., feces production rate vs. DW and respiration rate vs. DW) exhibited identical estimates of exponents, enabling accurate comparisons of the rates across temperatures. In contrast, disparities across temperatures of the values for the weight exponent were detected in other allometric equations, revealing that thermal effects on these rates have different degrees for large and small individuals. The SEG value in S. clava of different sizes was similar at lower temperatures (5-10 degrees C), peaking at 15 degrees C. The SFG was positive with a relatively constant K-2 in this temperature range. This positive energy balance reflects the reduction in metabolic costs at lower temperatures. In contrast, increased metabolic costs at higher temperatures (20-25 degrees C) resulted in lowered SFG and K-2 values, indicating that the feeding rate did not increase as greatly in compensation for the increased metabolic costs at higher temperatures. The lowered absorption at 25 degrees C (compared with 20 degrees C) resulted in negative SFG and K-2 values. Finally, our results confirm that the absence of compensatory adjustment to warmer conditions leads to energetic disruption at a whole organism level at such temperatures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Four tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) crops were grown in three multispan greenhouses over two seasons (2007/08 and 2008/09) in southern Spain. The experimental greenhouses were divided in two by a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film of 180 mu m thickness. The sidewalls and roof vents of the greenhouses were covered with different insect-proof screens in the two halves of each greenhouse, with porosities phi ranging from 0.32 to 0.47.

We have also analysed the screens' effect on the greenhouse ventilation rate R by means of a two-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model. The results indicate maximum differences of 27% for R and 38% for C-d between the different screens analysed. However, the wind and temperature conditions in the experimental greenhouse are generally less extreme than those simulated, reducing the effect of the ventilation on the inside climate.

Zooplankton was sampled at day and night, during two subsequent days at 4 stations inside and outside of the upwelling plume. Three depth strata were sampled: 0-20 m, 20-80 m and 80-200 m. Oceanographic data were obtained in a grid of 23 stations using a CTDO, a fluorometer and a Doppler current meter. Calanus chilensis was mostly represented by late stages, i.e. copepodid C5 and adult males and females. There were no day/night effects on vertical distribution, and abundance was significantly higher inside the upwelling plume in the upper 20-m layer at nearly 14 ind. m(-3), compared to ca. 5 ind. m(-3) outside the upwelling plume. Temperature at 10 m depth and biomass, estimated from stage numbers and their mean dry weights, were used to estimate growth and daily production of Calanus at temperature-dependent rates. The potential loss of biomass from the upwelling center because of advection in the upwelling plume was estimated from current data in the Ekman layer and biomass density. The mean cross-shelf component of the current was estimated at 10.4 km d(-1) within the upwelling plume. This yielded a loss of biomass of 9.7 mg dry weight m(-2) . Production, estimated by a temperature-dependent approach, ranged between 44 and 35 mg dry weight m(-2) d(-1), at mean temperatures of 14.6 degreesC and 15.8 degreesC inside and outside of the upwelling plume respectively. Within the plume, as much as 22% of daily production may be advected offshore. However, a higher concentration of biomass in the upwelling plume allowed a greater production compared to surrounding areas. A mass balance approach suggests that advective losses may not have a major impact on the C. chilensis population, because of very high daily production at temperature-dependent rates.",,,,,,"Marin, Victor/0000-0003-2491-6825; Escribano, Ruben/0000-0002-9843-7723",,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-8158,,,,,,2001,453,1-3,,,,,143,151,,10.1023/A:1013120005384,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013120005384,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000172600200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a supply chain with fluctuating temperatures, mathematical models will be valuable tools to simulate this formation as a function of temperature and time. These models are essential to link sensor data on the formation of TMA to the actual freshness of fish. Existing models for the formation of TMA in fish needed improvements and secondary models for the effect of temperature on the formation of TMA are lacking in the literature. Three different approaches were evaluated on their ability to simulate the experimental observed TMA formation at 4 different temperatures (0, 5, 10 and 15 degrees C). In the first approach the existing models were improved and the temperature effect was modelled by an empirical model using four parameters. This model is able to simulate the TMA formation at static temperatures. Since TMA is produced on fresh cod fillets by the micro-organisms Shewanella putrefaciens and Photobacterium phosphoreum the microbial Baranyi-Roberts model was initially used for modelling the TMA formation, but this model was found to be too complex (too many correlated parameters that could not be estimated). In the third approach it was seen that a simplified Baranyi-Roberts model with only three parameters could be used to predict the TMA formation with equal accuracy. The influence of the temperature on the parameter mu(max) was modelled using the extended square root model of Ratkowsky and the differences in TMA formation profiles of different batches could be described by the batch specific parameter N-0 representing the initial quality. The presented dynamic model is valuable in predicting the formation of TMA in a fresh fish supply chain with dynamic temperatures. This model has the potential to be used to link sensor data of TMA in the headspace to the actual freshness status of the fish. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The upper thermal threshold for survival of the deep-water coral Lophelia pertusa (Linnaeus, 1758) is generally accepted to be similar to 12-14 degrees C, based on field observations of coral distributions. However, hydrographic conditions over coral mounds are dynamic on various scales, often producing temperature fluctuations of unpredictable duration and magnitude. This study investigated the survival of L pertusa under a range of experimental temperatures: 5, 8 degrees C (ambient), 15, 20 and 25 degrees C, for two experimental durations: 24 h and seven days. There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) in survival among temperatures after both the 24 h and the seven day experiments. The experimental data were supported by survival data for coral fragments deployed on benthic landers off North Carolina, where historical data show that temperatures over coral mounds vary greatly and reached 15 degrees C on a recurring basis. Experimental and in situ data suggested that the upper lethal temperature limit for this deep-sea coral species is near 15 degrees C Tolerance to fluctuations in environmental variables, such as temperature, decreases the probability of mortality in the face of anomalous events and/or variable environments. Understanding the eco-physiology of structure forming deep-coral taxa will help inform management strategies; for example, preserving those ecosystems that are more resilient to threats from predicted changes.

One widely used approach to retrieve soil moisture data is based on satellite remote sensing technology.

Remotely sensed soil moisture data retrieved by the MWRI onboard the FY3B satellite is currently provided at a 25 km grid resolution. In this study, in terms of the thermal inertia theory, the FY3B soil moisture products were downscaled from 25 km to 1 km based on the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) grid (12.5 km). For different ranges of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the relationship of soil moisture and diurnal temperature change from the land surface model of NLDAS could be obtained.

However, another but poorly studied main characteristic of global change appears to be an increase in temperature variability. Most of the current analyses of global change have focused on mean values, paying less attention to the role of the fluctuations of environmental variables. We experimentally tested the effects of environmental temperature variability on characteristics associated to the fitness (body mass balance, growth rate, and survival), metabolic rate (VCO2) and molecular traits (heat shock protein expression, Hsp70), in an ectotherm, the terrestrial woodlouse Porcellio laevis. Our general hypotheses are that higher values of thermal amplitude may directly affect life-history traits, increasing metabolic cost and stress responses. At first, results supported our hypotheses showing a diversity of responses among characters to the experimental thermal treatments. We emphasize that knowledge about the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which animals cope with environmental changes is essential to understand the impact of mean climatic change and variability. Also, we consider that the studies that only incorporate only mean temperatures to predict the life-history, ecological and evolutionary impact of global temperature changes present important problems to predict the diversity of responses of the organism. This is because the analysis ignores the complexity and details of the molecular and physiological processes by which animals cope with environmental variability, as well as the life-history and demographic consequences of such variability.

Although there are few experimental reports on the temperature dependency of IP3R channel functions, we did not find any detailed theoretical study on this subject. For this purpose, we used a modified Gillespie algorithm to investigate the effect of temperature on the conditions affecting the open state of a single subunit of the De Young-Keizer (DYK) model. Population of the states was considered as the subject of fluctuation. Key features of the channel, such as bell-shaped dependency of open probability to the Calcium concentrations were modeled at different temperatures, too. The range of temperature variation was selected by regarding the experimental data on IP3R channel. By increasing the temperature, we had the very slow time domains (t: 10(-1) s) and the much slower time domains (t: 10(0) s) in addition to other time domains, which could be seen as new time categories in InsP3R studies, and so the results were reported in these time domains, as well. We found out that increase in temperature declined the open probability in some concentrations of Ca2+ and/or IP3. Also, by introducing the intensity graphs, broadening of the range of fluctuations and lowering of the order of frequency of fluctuations for the population of each state were observed due to the temperature increments. The temperature effects on the activation and inactivation states of the channel were studied in the framework of the reaction paths. We did not find similar paths at different time domains; several paths observed which were totally different all together. These time-dependent reaction paths are also depending on the Ca2+ and/or the IP3 concentrations. So, one can predict the most probable reaction paths at different concentrations and temperatures and also determine which kind of the path it is; a path for closing the channel or a path to open it. Finally, the temperature effects on the calcium inhibited states were studied. We found out that calcium ion inhibitions were shifted to lower calcium concentration by increasing the temperature. The results suggests that inhibiting role of calcium is not only [Ca2+] and/or [IP3] dependent, but also temperature dependent.",,,,,"Monajjemi, Majid/F-6526-2017; Hashemianzadeh, Seyed Majid/P-3560-2018","Monajjemi, Majid/0000-0002-6665-837X; Hashemianzadeh, Seyed Majid/0000-0003-1480-9014",,,,,,,,,,,,,0218-3390,1793-6470,,,,DEC,2009,17,4,,,,,817,852,,10.1142/S0218339009003058,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218339009003058,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000273426400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study quantified the spatial and temporal density and distributional patterns of the slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatits) population in Catamaran Brook, New Brunswick, with the aim of gaining a better understanding of their response to natural environmental variability. We predicted that sculpin densities would follow a longitudinal temperature (Yradient from headwater to mouth and would be hi(yhlv sensitive to fluctuations in stream flow and substrate disturbance. Electrofishing surveys conducted twice per year from 1991 to 1998 revealed significant differences in sculpin density between years, reaches, and habitats, but not between seasons. The highest sculpin densities were found in those reaches with the coolest summer water temperature. The Middle reach in Catamaran Brook annually supported the highest sculpin density, followed by the headwater or Upper reach and then by the two lowermost reaches: Gorge and Lower. Stochastic events also influenced population dynamics. A mid-winter ice break-up (1996) and its associated flood and ice scour caused the greatest disturbance of the sculpin population, resulting in a significant density decline and a shift in the population age structure. A bedload movement experiment conducted to further assess sculpins' response to substrate stability identified greater bed stability in the Upper and Middle reaches of the brook than in the Lower reach. The pattern of sculpin distribution observed in this study is consistent with the idea that distribution and abundance of sculpin are significantly influenced by stream temperature but also, in part, by stream bed stability.

We investigated the effect of acute exposure to sub-zero temperature on the heart rate and recovery capacity of invasive crayfish Faxonius limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus, and Procambarus clarkii. The experiments used non-invasive sensors to assess cardiac activity relative to survival and recovery of crayfish during short (30 min) and prolonged (60 min) exposures to -18 degrees C. All P. clarkii specimens survived freezing temperature and rewarming and recovered after the short exposure, and 25% recovered after prolonged exposure. All F. limosus and P. leniusculus died during the recovery period following both exposures. In all tested specimens a heartbeat was measurable several hours after conclusion of exposure, gradually declining in F. limosus and P. leniusculus. The P. clarkii heart rate decreased abruptly upon exposure to sub-zero temperature, and recovery to nearly the pre-exposure rate took longer than for F. limosus and P. leniusculus. Heartbeat decline slopes were as follows: P. clarkii, 80.2 degrees +/- 2.1 degrees, > F. limosus, 74.9 degrees +/- 4.1 degrees, > P. leniusculus, 70.3 degrees +/- 3.7 degrees. During the cooling warming cycle, F. limosus and P. leniusculus demonstrated more gradual heartbeat decline and more rapid recovery to original levels but ultimately did not survive, most likely due to energy depletion associated with heartbeat fluctuation while cooling. These findings may increase our understanding of the broader distribution of P. clarkii than expected according to its ecological optima and provide insight into the mechanisms of invasive crayfish adaptability.",,,,,"Buric, Milos/F-8114-2015","Buric, Milos/0000-0003-2220-5579",,,,,,,,,,,,,0075-9511,1873-5851,,,,MAR,2022,93,,,,,,,,125962,10.1016/j.limno.2022.125962,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2022.125962,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000783137500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, IoT applied to plant ecophysiology and hydrology aims to unravel the vulnerability of trees to climatic stress via a single tree assessment at costs that enable massive deployment. We present the performance of the TreeTalker to elucidate the functional relation between the stem water content in trees and respective internal/external (stem hydraulic activity/abiotic) drivers. Continuous stem water content records are provided by an in-house-designed capacitance sensor, hosted in the reference probe of the TreeTalker sap flow measuring system, based on the transient thermal dissipation (TTD) method. In order to demonstrate the capability of the TreeTalker, a three-phase experimental process was performed including (1) sensor sensitivity analysis, (2) sensor calibration, and (3) long-term field data monitoring. A negative linear correlation was demonstrated under temperature sensitivity analysis, and for calibration, multiple linear regression was applied on harvested field samples, explaining the relationship between the sample volumetric water content and the sensor output signal. Furthermore, in a field scenario, TreeTalkers were mounted on adult Fagus sylvatica L. and Quercus petraea L. trees, from June 2020 to October 2021, in a beech-dominated forest near Marburg, Germany, where they continuously monitored sap flux density and stem volumetric water content (stem VWC). The results show that the range of stem VWC registered is highly influenced by the seasonal variability of climatic conditions. Depending on tree characteristics, edaphic and microclimatic conditions, variations in stem VWC and reactions to atmospheric events occurred. Low sapwood water storage occurs in response to drought, which illustrates the high dependency of trees on stem VWC under water stress. Consistent daily variations in stem VWC were also clearly detectable. Stem VWC constitutes a significant portion of daily transpiration (using TreeTalkers, up to 4% for the beech forest in our experimental site). The diurnal-nocturnal pattern of stem VWC and sap flow revealed an inverse relationship. Such a finding, still under investigation, may be explained by the importance of water recharge during the night, likely due to sapwood volume changes and lateral water distribution rather than by a vertical flow rate. Overall, TreeTalker demonstrated the potential of autonomous devices for monitoring sap density and relative stem VWC in the field of plant ecophysiology and hydrology.",,,,,"Marchesini, Luca Belelli/M-3554-2014; Valentini, Riccardo/D-1226-2010","Marchesini, Luca Belelli/0000-0001-8408-4675; asgharinia, shahla/0000-0002-6210-1232; Valentini, Riccardo/0000-0002-6756-5634; Opgenoorth, Lars/0000-0003-0737-047X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1999-4907,,,,JUL,2022,13,7,,,,,,,1040,10.3390/f13071040,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13071040,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000831846100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Maturation of males and females and their gamete quality depended strongly on temperature regime. The highest percentages of maturing fish and highest gamete quality were obtained under a creek water temperature regime with natural seasonal fluctuations. In warmed creek water (3-4 degrees C), at a constant temperature of 8-9 degrees C, and under an abruptly increasing temperature, regime maturation rates and gamete quality were reduced. The effect was more pronounced in females than in males. The spawning dates of different wild Austrian grayling populations were also correlated with water temperature data collected during the last 10-15 years. The mean spawning date expressed as the number of days from 21 December until spawning ranged from 98 to 111 days for lower elevation populations, while it was considerably delayed for an alpine population. All populations spawned at water temperatures of 5.5-7.2 degrees C.

J,"Stewart, HA; Allen, PJ",,,,"Stewart, Heather A.; Allen, Peter J.",,,Critical Thermal Maxima of Two Geographic Strains of Channel and Hybrid Catfish,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Critical thermal maxima have been used extensively to provide physiologically and ecologically valuable reference points that identify early signs of thermal stress. In catfish pond culture, daily temperature maxima up to 36 degrees C and daily fluctuations of as much as 6 degrees C are observed. These extreme conditions will probably be exacerbated by the effects of global climate change. Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus have a broad natural distribution from southern Canada to northern Mexico. If regional genetic differences could cause strains with a southern distribution to have greater thermal tolerance than strains with a northern distribution, and consequently a greater critical thermal maximum, then hybrid catfish (Channel Catfish x Blue Catfish I. furcatus) strains might be expected to have greater critical thermal maxima than their respective Channel Catfish strains because Blue Catfish have a more southern range of distribution. To examine this, we quantified differences of acute thermal tolerance in two geographically distinct strains of Channel Catfish and their hybrid crosses with an industry standard strain of Blue Catfish. The catfish were subjected to water temperature increases of 2.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C center dot h(-1) until they lost equilibrium. Standard length, which ranged from 162 to 320mm, had a significant effect on survival, survival being greater in larger fish. The critical thermal maximum ranged from 38.6 degrees C to 40.3 degrees C. Southern Channel Catfish tolerated higher temperatures than northern Channel Catfish did, and both strains of Channel Catfish tolerated higher temperatures than their hybrid catfish strains did. This study indicates that geographically distinct catfish strains differ in acute thermal tolerance and suggests heritability for this trait, as evidenced by similar responses in Channel Catfish and their corresponding hybrid crosses with Blue Catfish.

This study introduces the Water Height and Temperature in Container Habitats Energy Model (WHATCH'EM), a state-of-the-science, physically based energy balance model of water height and temperature in containers that may serve as development sites for mosquitoes. The authors employ WHATCH'EM to model container water dynamics in three cities along a climatic gradient in Mexico ranging from sea level, where Ae. aegypti is highly abundant, to similar to 2100 m, where Ae. aegypti is rarely found. When compared with measurements from a 1-month field experiment in two of these cities during summer 2013, WHATCH'EM realistically simulates the daily mean and range of water temperature for a variety of containers. To examine container dynamics for an entire season, WHATCH'EM is also driven with field-derived meteorological data from May to September 2011 and evaluated for three commonly encountered container types. WHATCH'EM simulates the highly nonlinear manner in which air temperature, humidity, rainfall, clouds, and container characteristics (shape, size, and color) determine water temperature and height. Sunlight exposure, modulated by clouds and shading from nearby objects, plays a first-order role. In general, simulated water temperatures are higher for containers that are larger, darker, and receive more sunlight. WHATCH'EM simulations will be helpful in understanding the limiting meteorological and container-related factors for proliferation of Ae. aegypti and may be useful for informing weather-driven early warning systems for viruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti.",,,,,,"Monaghan, Andrew/0000-0002-8170-2359; Steinhoff, Daniel/0000-0002-4233-8750",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1087-3562,,,,DEC,2016,20,,,,,,1,31,,10.1175/EI-D-15-0048.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/EI-D-15-0048.1,,,,,,,,29123363,,,,,WOS:000390355300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, while both mean temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs) are expected to increase under global warming, latitudinal differences in the effects of DTFs have not been documented. We tested whether low-latitude populations of an ectotherm deal better with greater DTF than high-latitude populations, especially at a high mean temperature close to the optimal temperature for growth where DTF causes exposure to extreme high temperatures. We evaluated the impact of DTFs when assessing the effect of gradual thermal evolution at the high latitude with a space-for-time substitution. We compared effects of both mean temperatures (20 and 24 degrees C) and DTFs (constant=0 degrees C, low=5 degrees C and high=10 degrees C) on growth rates between low-latitude and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans in a common-garden experiment. DTFs, if anything, reduced growth and were generally stressful as indicated by reductions in body condition, antioxidant defence and metabolic rate, and increases in oxidative damage. Most negative effects of DTFs were only present at a mean of 24 degrees C when too high temperatures were reached during a daily cycle. Notably, while 4 degrees C warming was beneficial in terms of growth rate at both latitudes at a constant temperature regime, this changed in a negative effect at high DTF. Moreover, this modulating effect of the mean temperature by DTF differed between latitudes indicating local thermal adaptation. While 4 degrees C warming at low DTF still caused faster growth in low-latitude larvae, it already slowed growth in high-latitude larvae. This supports the emerging insight that warming would increase growth in high-latitude larvae in the absence of DTF, yet would decrease growth in the more realistic scenarios with DTF. In contrast, a space-for-time substitution approach suggested that under gradual thermal evolution, the evolved high-latitude larvae would no longer suffer a growth reduction in the presence of DTF. Our study provided important proof-of-principle that jointly integrating gradual thermal evolution and the expected increase in DTF generates opposing predictions of effects of global warming on this ectotherm.",,,,,"Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020","Verheyen, Julie/0000-0001-7496-5137; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,APR,2019,88,4,,,,,624,636,,10.1111/1365-2656.12946,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12946,,,,,,,,30637722,,,,,WOS:000467994800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The complex life cycle of M. margaritifera includes an obligate development phase of glochidia larvae on a suitable host fish. Knowledge on the progression of the parasitic phase and on the factors governing excystment of juvenile mussels are particularly crucial for artificial breeding and conservation measures. The core objective of this study was to study excystment of M. margaritifera after maintaining the infested hosts under constant water temperatures between 11 and 12 degrees C and to determine the sum of daily water temperatures (day degrees) required by M. margaritifera for completion of metamorphosis. In a standardized laboratory experiment, excystment of juvenile mussels from brown trout (Salmo trutta) was found between 1700 and 3400 day degrees post infestation, indicating highly variable, development times of individual glochidia and the absence of a previously postulated threshold temperature of >= 15 degrees C for successful excystment of living juveniles. Consequently, the parasitic phase does not seem to limit the current distribution range and reintroduction of the species into cool headwater areas, as well as the culturing under constant water temperature conditions in typical salmonid fish hatchery setups.

In this study, 40 healthy juvenile male S. serrata from the same broodstock were grouped randomly into four groups, which were kept at 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 27 degrees C, with the same feeding regime during a 3-week adaptation period. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the proteome was conducted to separate the specific proteins responsible for low temperature adaptation. Variations in the mitochondria were observed using transmission electron microscopy, and fatty acid composition was determined using gas chromatography. The results showed that different numbers of specific proteins were expressed under different low temperature adaptation, with more expressed at 5 degrees C and 10 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. Mitochondrial morphology also varied under different low temperature adaptation, but there was no linear relationship between microbial density and adaptation temperature. The composition of different fatty acids in the gill varied considerably with adaptation temperature, but elongation of the carbon chain and transition from fatty acids occurred at lower temperatures. Thus, changes in the specific proteins, mitochondria and fatty acid composition of the gill were the positive effects of low temperature on metabolism, leading to improved adaptation ability in S. serrata.

A re-activation of treated farm or laboratory animals which is set up too early might produce reduction of efficiency or falsification of experimental results. Investigations on p.op. de-synchronisation have proved that healthiness means - besides the absence of clinical symptoms - also stable relations among the circadian rhythms. As the ultradian rhythms (wavelength < 24 h) which exist beside the circadian ones depend on endogenic and exogenic factors much more than the circadian rhythms do, the aim of this study was to investigate strength and especially duration of changes p.op. in using core temperature rhythms of sheep as example, by setting great value on investigating ultradian rhythms. The core temperatures of 5 Merino-mixed sheep were permanently measured for 4 weeks p.op. by special radio telemetrical equipment, under controlled circumstances. All recorded data have been expertised macroscopically and Fourier-analysis was employed for judging phase shift and intensity of existing rhythms. Though no signs for systemic disturbances could be found and the recorded temperature always was in between the physiological range, important shifts of phases and variations in intensities in the ultradian scope as well as in the circadian one occurred.

Green roofs could contribute to cooling, providing insulation to buildings, and lead to substantial savings in energy for temperature control. This study compared the effects of hydroponic green roofs on the reductions of rooftop temperature and heat amplitude. Treatments include water depths, plant types and growth mediums. The experimental site was located in Taichung, the third largest city of Taiwan, which has a subtropical climate. The results indicate that, first, a water depth of 10 cm is sufficient to provide an ideal hydroponic green roof system that reduced rooftop temperatures and heat amplitude by 5 degrees C and 55%, respectively. Second, when vegetation was added to the ideal hydroponic roof, the rooftop temperature was further reduced by 3 degrees C to 5 degrees C and the rooftop heat amplitude was further reduced by 16%, compared with the corresponding values for the roof without vegetation. However, between the two types of plants tested, no differences were observed in the reduction of rooftop temperature and heat amplitude. Third, the solid-type growth medium slightly outperformed the hydroponic-type growth medium in reducing the rooftop temperature; however, the solid-type was more challenging regarding system installation, maintenance, and weed control.

Of particular concern is how increased warming in tidally fluctuating estuaries may impact the native and endangered delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus, Osmeridae). To help address this issue, we tested the effects of increased water temperature (fluctuating [17-21 degrees C] and warm [21 degrees C] acclimated treatments) on juvenile delta smelt individual and group behaviour, response to chemical alarm and predator cues, as well as capacity to evade predation. In addition, predation of delta smelt was tested in the presence of a dominant invasive competitor, Mississippi silversides (Menidia beryllina, Atherinopsidae), as well as comparative predation mortality on Mississippi silversides when isolated. After 7 days of increased temperature treatments, delta smelt in the warm treatment increased swimming velocity, decreased turning angle, and altered group structure with larger inter-individual distances compared to fish in the control (17 degrees C) and fluctuating temperature treatments. Following conspecific and predator chemical alarm cues, delta smelt showed anti-predator responses. Control and fluctuating treatment fish responded to conspecific cues with increased swimming speeds, decreased inter-individual distances and near-neighbour distances, and, after 15 min, fish recovered back to baseline behaviours. In contrast, fish in the warm treatment had not recovered after 15 min, and swimming speeds were maintained at roughly 25 cm/s, close to maximum capabilities. Fish in control and fluctuating treatments showed minimal responses to predator cues, whereas delta smelt exposed to warm conditions significantly increased swimming speeds and decreased turning angle. Predation of delta smelt by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides, Centrarchidae) was greatest under the warm treatment, correlating with altered behaviours of delta smelt; however, predation of Mississippi silversides was greater than delta smelt, independent of temperature. This study provides novel insight into the group behaviour of delta smelt, their response to predation, and how prolonged exposure to elevated temperature may induce negative individual and group behaviours causing alterations in predator-prey dynamics. This work highlights the importance of testing ecologically realistic temperature fluctuations in experiments as delta smelt had significantly altered responses to elevated temperature, dependent on variability of warming.",,,,,,"Davis, Brittany/0000-0003-3752-1830; Fangue, Nann/0000-0001-5419-0282; Todgham, Anne/0000-0003-1439-6985; Hansen, Matthew/0000-0001-7579-9927",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,DEC,2019,64,12,,,,,2156,2175,,10.1111/fwb.13403,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13403,,OCT 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000489221800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two commercial strains of A. japonicus, hybrid Shuiyuan No. 1 sea cucumbers (Ss) and Dalian local sea cucumbers (Ls), were used as test animals. In the MTD treatments, concentrations of soluble proteins and soluble sugars on the whole showed similar trends of an initial increase, a subsequent decrease and then an increase to a level similar to or higher than the initial level. Ca2+ concentration increased to the maximum level at 4 degrees C and did not return to the original concentration. The concentrations of Mg2+ and Cl-increased significantly to a higher level, which was maintained until the end of the experiment. However, the concentrations of Na+ and NO showed an opposite trend: an initial decrease in concentration to a low concentration that was maintained until the end of the experiment. In contrast, in the ATD experiment, the concentration of soluble proteins, soluble sugars, Mg2+, NO and Na+ showed a tendency for fluctuation or decrease. Only Ca2+ and Cl- concentrations showed a rising trend. Earlier responses and faster homeostatic ability were observed for Ss individuals than for Ls individuals, indicating a greater cold tolerance.

We conducted two experiments in January and April 2019, and performed daily observations of the timings of bud break in 1-year-old seedlings of sugar maple (Acer saccharumMarshall) from 25 Canadian provenances at two thermal conditions (14/10 and 18/14 degrees C day/night temperature) in a controlled environment. Overall, bud break started 6 days from the beginning of the experiments and finished after 125 days. The earlier events were observed in seedlings originating from the colder sites. Bud break was delayed by 4.8 days per additional degree Celsius in the mean annual temperature at the origin site. Warming advanced the timing of bud break by 17-27 days in January and by 3-8 days in April. Similar advancements in bud break were observed among provenances under warming conditions, which rejected our hypothesis that sugar maple populations have different phenological responses to warming. Our findings confirm the differentiation in ecotypes for the process of bud break in sugar maple.

The effects of material temperature on the separation were investigated by combining simulations and separation experiments. New concepts, such as separation index and direction angle, were proposed to clarify the related mechanism. It was found that reducing the material temperature can increase the Lorentz force on conductive non-ferrous particles, so the residual temperature after cryogenic crushing can be used to improve the separation between conductive nonferrous and non-conductive materials. Reducing the material temperature will also increase the fluctuation of the Lorentz force, which negatively affects the separation between different non-ferrous metals.

Soil hydraulic properties influence the redistribution of soil moisture within the soil profile. Soil moisture, in turn, influences the soil thermal properties and surface energy balance through evaporation, and hence the soil heat transfer. Synthetic experiments were used to test the hypothesis that assimilating soil temperature observations could lead to improved estimates of soil hydraulic properties. We also compared different data assimilation strategies to investigate the added value of jointly estimating soil thermal and hydraulic properties in soil moisture profile estimation. Results show that both soil thermal and hydraulic properties can be estimated using shallow soil temperatures. Jointly updating soil hydraulic properties and soil states yields robust and accurate soil moisture estimates. Further improvement is observed when soil thermal properties were also estimated together with the soil hydraulic properties and soil states. Finally, we show that the inclusion of a tuning factor to prevent rapid fluctuations of parameter estimation, yields improved soil moisture, temperature, and thermal and hydraulic properties.

Steentoft, L.M.Irvine & W.F.Farnham which often grows in many stressed Mediterranean coasts, mainly lagoons, was carried out to ascertain the optimum range and interaction of environmental factors on growth and composition with a view to potential mariculture. The methodology adopted was based on the synergy between mathematical modeling and laboratory experiments. An experimental design and a response surface methodology (RSM) were used to simulate field conditions. Experiments were done at 20 degrees C. The studied responses were daily growth rate (DGR), agar yields, and protein and R-phycoerythrin (RPE) contents. Second-order quadratic polynomial models for all studied responses were deduced and ANOVA showed them to be significant (p < 0.05). The RSM was successfully applied to assess the effects of abiotic factors (light, salinity, ammonium, and nitrate) and their interaction on the DGR, agar yields, and protein content. Gracilaria gracilis grew well (> 3% day(-1)) under all the combined abiotic factor conditions that were simulated. Hence, the optimum (5% day(-1)) was obtained around seawater salinity (36 psu), 198 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) irradiance and nitrogen concentration of 80 mu mol ammonium g(-1) fw L-1, and 210 mu mol nitrate g(-1) fw L-1. Optimum agar yields (15%) were obtained at a lower irradiance (70 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and a salinity of 24 psu combined with similar ammonium (80 mu mol g(-1) fw L-1) and nitrate (100 mu mol g(-1) fw L-1) concentrations. Optimum protein contents (23%) and RPE contents (1.2 mg g(-1) fw) were obtained at lower irradiance (70 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)), a salinity of 24 psu, an ammonium concentration of 80 mu mol g(-1) fw L-1, and lower nitrate concentration (10 mu mol g(-1) fw L-1). In addition, abiotic factor interaction effects occurred when one of them significantly contributes to response reduction. In conclusion, potential mariculture of G. gracilis in the lagoon is possible but related to their proteins and pigments (essentially RPE) contents in addition to agar yields.",,,,,,"Ben Ghedifa, Aziz/0000-0001-8083-6761; Mensi, Fethi/0000-0003-2713-7341",,,,,,,,,,,,,0921-8971,1573-5176,,,,OCT,2019,31,5,,,,,3025,3040,,10.1007/s10811-019-01826-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-019-01826-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000493895800023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our experiments showed that individuals grown under fluctuating temperature grew more than at the mean temperature. We estimated the expected sizes for the 15 degrees C treatment based on the Q(10) and for the fluctuating temperature treatment.

It is of great importance to find tools, including nutritional interventions on farms, able to reduce such imbalances and the consequent stress for animals. In light of this perspective, we investigated the correlations between temperature and metabolic performance in sea bass fed on diet containing oregano essential oil. Under the condition of our study, thermal changes affected the levels of several biomarkers (e.g., triglycerides and cholesterol) highlighting an attempt to provide for additional energy, to counterbalance the oxidative damage, and to maintain cell homeostasis. On the other side, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, TBARS levels, and the energetic balance seemed to benefit from the intake of oregano essential oil under exposure to thermal changes. A feeding trial for 150 days was carried out to evaluate the cross-effects between oregano essential oil (EO) dietary supplementation and dynamic temperature change in sea bass. Under exposure to rising temperature (13-25 degrees C), fish were fed with a control diet (CD) and two experimental diets supplemented with 100 (D100) and 200 ppm (D200) of EO. Feed inclusion of EO promoted the activity of antioxidant enzymes in sea bass exposed to increasing temperature. Consistently with the temperature rise, TBARS concentrations increased in CD and D200 groups, whereas were almost stable in D100. Trend of blood glucose in fish fed on CD was likely affected by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Similarly, the depletion of triglycerides and cholesterol in fish fed on CD likely supported the energy cost of gluconeogenesis. On the other hand, the reduction of glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol in D100 and D200 was mainly attributable to the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of EO. The higher levels of serum protein observed in D100 and D200 groups were also associated to a reduced thermal stress compared to CD.

Previous studies validating daily beak growth increments in these stages allowed age estimation and comparison of wild and cultured paralarvae. We aimed to improve age estimations in captivity, addressing the effect of temperature and diet, to obtain an accurate estimation of age in wild specimens collected from the coast to the open ocean off NW Spain and Morocco. We analysed the beak growth increments of reared paralarvae at 14 and 21 degrees C with 2 different crustacean prey taxa (Artemia and spider crab Maja brachydactyla zoeae) over 30 d. Daily increment deposition at 21 degrees C was confirmed, whereas <1 increment d(-1) was recorded at 14 degrees C. The width of the reading area grew accordingly with age; therefore, this beak region may be suitable for age estimation.

Experiments conducted in Georgia from 2017 to 2018 evaluated cultivar by storage condition by sampling date effects on three peanut cultivars. The effects of varying environments, with respect to different temperatures and humidity, on peanut seed viability was evaluated when stored up to 72 d. Seed germination and vigor were assessed in petri dishes on a thermal gradient table with temperatures ranging from 10.2 to 33.2 degrees C and incubated for 7 d. Daily mean temperature data were used to calculate growing degree day (GDD) accumulation via thermocouples. Maximum germination rates (b0) and GDD values at 80% germination (Germ80) were quantified. Results indicated that germination and vigor varied by cultivar, storage environment, and sampling date with respect to GDDs required to reach Germ80 and maximum germination (b0). Storage environment treatments consisted of (a) 9-12 degrees C and 43-51% relative humidity (RH), (b) 18-27 degrees C and 42-54% RH, (c) 12-37 degrees C and 48-74% RH, and (d) 24-46 degrees C and 33-85% RH. Storage environments affected seed germination, where environments with large fluctuations in temperature and RH (12-37 degrees C, 48-74% RH and 24-46 degrees C, 33-85% RH) for up to 72 d resulted in decreased percentage germination (>20 points) and vigor (>5 GDDs). However, excellent seed germinationand vigor were sustained where storage temperatures were below 18 degrees C and RH was below 54%.

As different ecophysiological capabilities to stand the various temperature, salinity and food conditions could explain why these two species do not coexist in the same environment, comparative experiments were performed on metabolism and feeding. The respiration and ammonia excretion of the two species were measured in different combinations of temperature (10, 15 and 20 degrees C) and salinity (15, 25 and 35 parts per thousand). For each temperature, at the salinity of 35 parts per thousand, respiration rates were less in A. clausi than in A. tonsa, the contrary being observed at the lowest salinity. At any temperature ammonia excretion was greater at the intermediate salinity in A. tonsa and least in A. clausi. In Acartia tonsa, Q(10) of respiration and excretion were minimum at the lowest salinity, while in A. clausi they were unaffected by salinity variation. The O:N atomic ratio (from respiration and ammonia excretion rates) was significantly more elevated in A. clausi (mean 21.2; range 13.6-28.7) than in A. tonsa (mean 11.3; range 4.2-25) suggesting a more proteinic oriented metabolism in the later. Feeding experiments where Dunaliella tertiolecta was used as food showed that both species obtained the same specific daily food ration at marine (> 30 parts per thousand) or lagoon (<16 parts per thousand) salinity. The relationships between ingestion and food concentration in the two species were not significantly different. These different results are compared to other ecophysiological information concerning these Acartia species (survival tolerances, osmotic regulation, feeding behaviour) and are discussed in relation with the characteristics of their niches in the studied region.

The water temperature in semi-enclosed bays fluctuates substantially compared to the neighbouring open sea, leading to thermal differences between the bay and the open sea. This phenomenon may stimulate the habitat shifts of seasonally migratory fish. To clarify the effects of temperature on the habitat shifts, we used depth-temperature data loggers to monitor the behaviour of adult Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus (range: 47.0-57.6 cm) in Omura Bay, a typical semi-enclosed bay in Japan. Ten flounder were tagged and released in December, 2007. A total of six loggers and four tagged fish were recovered; two loggers and one tagged fish were retrieved from the Omura Bay, and four loggers and three tagged fish from the East China Sea. The variations in temperature and harmonic constants of the M-2 tide extracted from the data logger showed that the emigration of three of the six fish from the bay to the open sea corresponded with the rise in temperature experienced by the fish. The water temperature in the bay continuously decreased and finally fell below the lower threshold of the optimal temperature for hatching of their eggs. Anatomical observations conducted on four individuals recaptured outside the bay revealed the presence of post-ovulatory follicles and/or oocytes at the maturing stage, indicating that they were spawning in the open sea at the time. Vertical swimming activity of the fish was significantly increased after the emigration from the bay, suggesting that spawning, foraging, and movement opportunities were increased. Therefore, it appears that adult Japanese flounder shift their habitats during the reproductive period to find higher temperatures that offer physiological and ecological advantages.

Recently, the frequent occurrence of high temperature stress has heavily influenced rice production. Proper heading date in specific environmental conditions could ensure high grain yield. Rice heading greatly depends on the accurate measurement of environmental changes, particularly in day length and temperature. In contrary to the detailed understanding of the photoperiod pathway, little has been known about how temperature regulates the genetic control of rice heading. Results: Near isogenic lines that were segregated for qHd1, were developed from a cross between indica rice varieties Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and Milyang 46 (MY46). Using a five sowing-date experiment in the paddy field, we observed the involvement of qHd1 in temperature responses. With the gradual increase of temperature from Trial I to V, heading date of MY46 homozygotes continued to decrease for about 5 d per trial from 76 to 58 d, while that of ZS97 homozygotes was promoted at the same rate from Trial I to III and then stabilized at 69 d. This thermal response was confirmed in a temperature-gradient experiment conducted in the phytotron. It is also found that tolerance of the ZS97 allele to heading acceleration at high temperature was associated with higher grain weight that resulted in higher grain yield. Then, by qRT-PCR and RNA-seq, we found the pathway OsMADS51-Ehd1-RFT1/Hd3a underlying the qHd1-mediated floral response to temperature. By sequence comparison, OsMADS51 for qHd1 displayed a 9.5-kb insertion in the 1st intron of the ZS97 allele compared to the MY46 allele. Furthermore, this large insertion is commonly found in major early-season indica rice varieties, but not in the middle-and late-season ones, which corresponds to the requirement for high-temperature tolerance during the heading and grain-filling stages of early-season rice. Conclusions: Beneficial alleles at qHd1 confer tolerance to high temperatures at the heading and grain-filling stages, playing a significant role in the eco-geographical adaptation of early-season indica rice during modern breeding. These results, together with the underlying OsMADS51-Ehd1-RFT1/Hd3a floral pathway, provide valuable information for better understanding the molecular mechanism of temperature responsive regulation of heading date and yield traits in rice.",,,,,"Zhuang, Jie-Yun/B-4131-2012","Zhuang, Jie-Yun/0000-0002-1439-5061; Chen, Jun-Yu/0000-0002-0418-3209",,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2229,,,,,JUN 7,2018,18,,,,,,,,112,10.1186/s12870-018-1330-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1330-5,,,,,,,,29879910,,,,,WOS:000434971800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To develop a better understanding of the relationship between changes in soil conditions and a plant's below-ground respiratory costs, the effects of temperature and soil drying on citrus root respiration were quantified in controlled greenhouse experiments. Chambers designed for measuring the respiration of individual roots were used. Under moist soil conditions, root respiration in citrus increased exponentially with changes in soil temperature (Q(10) = 1.8-2.0), provided that the changes in temperature were short-term. However, when temperatures were held constant, root respiration did not increase exponentially with increasing temperatures. Instead, the roots acclimated to controlled temperatures above 23 degreesC, thereby reducing their metabolism in warmer soils. Under drying soil conditions, root respiration decreased gradually beginning at 6% soil water content and reached a minimum at <2% soil water content in sandy soil. A model was constructed from greenhouse data to predict diurnal patterns of fine root respiration based on temperature and soil water content. The model was then validated in the field using data obtained by CO2 trapping on root systems of mature citrus trees. The trees were grown at a site where the soil temperature and water content were manipulated. Respiration predicted by the model was in general agreement with observed rates, which indicates the model may be used to estimate entire root system respiration for citrus.",,,,,"Eissenstat, David/AAE-2793-2020; Bouma, Tjeerd J/A-9841-2011","Bryla, David/0000-0002-9908-5993",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-7791,1365-3040,,,,AUG,2001,24,8,,,,,781,790,,10.1046/j.1365-3040.2001.00723.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2001.00723.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000170401600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Predictions of Rs and associated feedback to climate change remain largely uncertain, in part due to the high temporal heterogeneity of temperature sensitivity (apparent Q(10)) of Rs under a changing climate. Therefore, it is of critical importance to provide better insight into how Q(10) varies across multiple temporal scales. We investigated the diurnal, seasonal, and annual variabilities in the Q(10) of Rs using continuous Rs measurements (at hourly intervals) over six growing seasons in a mature temperate larch plantation in North China. We found that night-time values of Q(10) were slightly lower than daytime values. Large seasonal and annual fluctuations of Q(10) were observed, as illustrated by high coefficients of variation of 15.0% and 21.8%, respectively. The higher Q(10) in spring and autumn were primarily regulated by fine root growth and higher soil moisture after snow melt in spring, and leaf senescence in autumn. Lower Q(10) in summer may have been caused by limitations in substrate availability and microbial activity resulting from drought, which also caused a decoupling of Rs from soil temperature in summer. Furthermore, a bivariate nonlinear model incorporating both soil temperature and soil moisture best explained Q(10) variability. Generally, lower soil temperature and higher soil moisture lead to higher values of Q(10), indicating that climate warming could exert a negative effect on Q(10), partially offsetting the warming-induced increase in soil C loss. We provide long-term field experimental evidence that it would be inappropriate to estimate Rs on a multiyear scale using a fixed Q(10) value or a value obtained from one season and/or one year. Thus, we emphasize the importance of incorporating the seasonal and annual heterogeneities of Q(10) into C cycle model simulations under future climate change scenarios. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Growth became light saturated (when mu = mu(max)) between 70 and 80 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and was inhibited at similar to 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at all temperatures (5-20 degrees C). The range of temperatures at which T.curviseriata can grow (5-20 degrees C) coincides with the temperature range over which it is found in the field. In contrast, the thermal optimum for growth, 20 degrees C, was higher than the range of temperatures (between 5 and 10 degrees C) characteristic of the winter-early spring bloom in Bahia Blanca estuary. The mean specific growth rate of T.curviseriata was not affected by salinity over the tested range between 25 and 40 p.p.t. Field observations and experimental data support the characterization of T.curviseriata as a eurythermal and euryhaline species adapted to growth at relatively low light intensity. These characteristics may explain the ability of T.curviseriata to flourish seasonally when light conditions are apparently limiting and its presence almost year round under variable conditions of temperature and salinity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0142-7873,,,,,JUN,1999,21,6,,,,,1101,1110,,10.1093/plankt/21.6.1101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.6.1101,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000080923500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study was to quantify the impacts of water temperature, benthic light and nutrient enrichment on horizontal expansion of C. taxifolia, in the absence of competition from other benthic flora. Field experiments were undertaken in 1 native C. taxifolia population (Moreton Bay, Australia) and 2 invasive C. taxifolia populations (Pittwater and Port River Estuary, Australia). Manipulative experiments were conducted across a range of seasons and different shading and nutrient treatments to determine the effects of water temperature, benthic light dose and nutrient enrichment on horizontal expansion (stolon extension rate). Nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment had negligible effects on stolon extension rate at all locations, suggesting that nutrient conditions at the study sites were saturating for C. taxifolia. Shading significantly reduced stolon extension in Pittwater, and season/water temperature significantly affected stolon extension in Port River Estuary; only in Moreton Bay were both shading and season/water temperature significant. When all data were pooled in a general linear model, water temperature and average daily benthic light dose (log-transformed) significantly affected stolon extension, but nutrient enrichment did not. Site, season and the interaction between water temperature and benthic light dose also improved model performance, indicating that site-specific factors which varied between seasons also affected the measured stolon extension. Overall, our results indicate that C. taxifolia growth increased with light disproportionately at higher temperatures.",,,,,"O'Brien, Katherine/W-3011-2019; O'Brien, Katherine R/J-3198-2014","O'Brien, Katherine/0000-0001-8972-9161; O'Brien, Katherine R/0000-0001-8972-9161",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,,,,,,2013,472,,,,,,61,72,,10.3354/meps10044,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps10044,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000313344300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

To study the influence of temperature, nine temperature intervals were evaluated, ranging from 15.0 to 40.0 degrees C. A randomized block design experiment was used with five replications and 20 seeds per replication, and performed twice. To evaluate light intensity on seed germination, a randomized experimental design was used with eight replications and 25 seeds per replication. The treatments applied were: photoperiod with temperature alternation; photoperiod with constant temperature; darkness with temperature alternation; and darkness with constant temperature. The photoperiod consisted of 8 hours of light and 16 hours of darkness, and the constant temperature was 25 degrees C. The treatments with temperature alternations were established with 8 hours at 30 degrees C, and 16 hours at 20 degrees C. Germination was assessed daily to calculate the total percentage of germination as well as the Germination Velocity Index (GVI). To study the influence of seeding depth on plant emergence, 25 seeds were seeded at 0, 20, 40, and 80 mm in pots with sieved soil. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. Seedling emergence was monitored daily until the 15th day after seeding. After that period, the total percentage of emergence was calculated for each experimental unit, as well as the Emergence Velocity Index (EVI). Formation of normal seedlings and the Germination Velocity Index were different among temperatures and higher germination percentages were observed between 20.3 degrees C and 37.5 degrees C.

In this study, the role of two morphotypes of external layers inMicrocystisandNostocin mass transfer and instantaneous temperature shock were explored by noninvasive microtest technology (NMT) after a series of pretreatments, to obtain the external layers retained or stripped samples. The results showed no statistical influence on photosynthetic activity between retained and stripped samples in bothMicrocystisandNostoc. External-layer-retaining strains had higher net O(2)effluxes than stripped strains. Moreover, the net NH(4)(+)influx was significantly higher for the sheath retainingNostocthan for the stripped sample, indicating that external layers might be an important feature driving mass transfer in cyanobacteria. However, the role of slime in NH(4)(+)absorption was limited compared with that of sheath. In addition, external-layer-retaining strains exhibited a longer response time to instantaneous temperature shock, greater net O(2)effluxes at a 4 degrees C shock and lower net O(2)influx at a 35 degrees C shock, which were interpreted as reflecting a tolerance to temperature fluctuation over short time scales via a buffer function of external layers to stabilize cell activity, ameliorating the efficiency of photosynthesis and respiration. These results advance current knowledge regarding the external layers, especially the dense sheath, involved in the mass transfer in cyanobacteria, and provide new clues concerning the adaptive strategies of cyanobacteria under global climate changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-2607,,,,JUN,2020,8,6,,,,,,,861,10.3390/microorganisms8060861,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8060861,,,,,,,,32517320,,,,,WOS:000554616400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using simulation results and statistical analysis, the three main factors affecting the surface temperature for fixed supply water flow are determined as the average temperature of the non-cooling surface, the indoor air temperature, and the internal surface temperature of the outer window. The contribution rates of these factors are 47.6%, 39.2% and 10.1%, respectively.

Despite this popularity, little is known of the role of temperature acclimation and variability in shaping the breadth and amplitude of the thermal performance curve for aerobic scope. If daily thermal experience can modify the characteristics of the thermal performance curve, interpretations of aerobic scope data from the literature may be misguided. Here, tropical barramundi (Lates calcarifer) were acclimated for similar to 4 months to cold (23 degrees C), optimal (29 degrees C) or warm (35 degrees C) conditions, or to a daily temperature cycle between 23 and 35 degrees C (with a mean of 29 degrees C). Measurements of aerobic scope were conducted every 3-4 weeks at three temperatures (23, 29 and 35 degrees C), and growth rates were monitored. Acclimation to constant temperatures caused some changes in aerobic scope at the three measurement temperatures via adjustments in standard and maximum metabolic rates, and growth rates were lower in the 23 degrees C-acclimated group than in all other groups. The metabolic parameters and growth rates of the thermally variable group remained similar to those of the 29 degrees C-acclimated group. Thus, acclimation to a variable temperature regime did not broaden the thermal performance curve for aerobic scope. We propose that thermal performance curves for aerobic scope are more plastic in amplitude than in breadth, and that the metabolic phenotype of at least some fish may be more dependent on the mean daily temperature than on the daily temperature range.",,,,,"Rubio-Gracia, Francesc/ABG-5056-2021; Clark, Timothy/K-7129-2012","Rubio-Gracia, Francesc/0000-0002-0991-5341; Scheuffele, Hanna/0000-0002-6095-5103; Clark, Timothy/0000-0001-8738-3347",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,DEC,2021,224,24,,,,,,,jeb243504,10.1242/jeb.243504,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.243504,,,,,,,,34821366,,,,,WOS:000738259300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Aphids are the model species in studying the association of insect biology with large-scale climate fluctuations because they multiply only within a certain range of temperatures and their rate of development directly depends on temperature. Here, we investigate the effect of climate warming on phenology and voltinism of the juniper aphid (Cinara juniperi De Geer 1773), a native species of a temperate climate zone in Poland. We also experimentally test for the temperature optimum of the study species. Our study demonstrated that environmental conditions significantly affected phenology of juniper aphid. The timing of larval emergence depended on mean temperatures in March, and in warmer years larvae appeared earlier. The emergence of the sexual generation was related to mean temperatures in August, and higher temperatures resulted in later sexual reproduction. Despite the elongation of the entire life cycle, by almost 3 months, we observed only one additional generation in warmer years. A possible explanation for this pattern may be that the increase in temperature recorded in recent years went beyond the temperature optimum of the study species. Our chamber experiment supports this assumption - juniper aphids developed faster and reproduced more effectively at 20 degrees C than at 25 degrees C.",,,,,"Durak, Ridvan/I-3387-2014","Durak, Ridvan/0000-0002-3935-176X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0394-9370,1828-7131,,,,APR 2,2016,28,2,,,,,188,201,,10.1080/03949370.2015.1034785,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03949370.2015.1034785,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000371630400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature. through its effects on physiological processes, also influences motion. Because water viscosity is physically coupled to temperature, changes in temperature can influence the activity of microscopic organisms through both physiological and physical means. To partition these effects, we artificially altered seawater viscosity and, at two temperatures, we measured swimming speed and water movement by larvae of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus. Over an environmentally relevant, 10-degree drop in water temperature (22 to 12-degrees-C), swimming speed was reduced by approximately 40 % and water movement was reduced by 35 %. 40% of the decrease in swimming speed and 55 % of the decrease in water movement were accounted for by increases in viscosity alone. The physical effects of viscosity can therefore make up a large component of the effect of temperature on activity of microscopic organisms. If uncorrected for effects of viscosity, temperature coefficients such as Q10 values can overestimate the influence of temperature on the physiological processes that underlie the generation of motion at small spatial scales, These changes in viscosity may cause substantial reductions or increases in swimming and feeding rates that are biologically relevant. Environmental variation in viscosity due to temperature fluctuations could lead to temperature responses or adaptations that are nonphysiological.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,MAR,1993,176,,,,,,207,221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993KV68100014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The U-value of a material can be measured using the Guarded Hot Box method. The setup comprises of three parts the metering box, the guard box and the cold box. In this method a constant heat flow needs to be maintained through the test specimen from the metering box to the cold box. Thus it is important to control temperatures in all the three parts accurately. In the present work the temperatures of the metering box and the guard box have been controlled using three different software based temperature control strategies. In the first two strategies on-off control was implemented while in the third strategy proportional control was implemented. From the experimental data it was found that similar performances were obtained in the first two test cases where the temperatures could be controlled satisfactorily.

The extent to which natural fall diets both (a) vary in PUFA content and (b) influence the torpor patterns of free-ranging populations of hibernating mammals is unknown, however. We conducted a 3-yr study on the diet PUFA contents and subsequent hibernation patterns of free-ranging arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii) in the Brooks Range of Alaska. We found that the PUFA contents of fall diets varied more than threefold among individuals.

Recent expanded use of radiant heating and cooling systems has presented new challenges for the usage of globe thermometers in the built environment by causing additional radiant asymmetries and performance expectations. Therefore, we replicate the original Bedford & Warner work to reconsider and develop a more holistic understanding of black globe performance and the determination of MRT in buildings. We recreate the MRT and air temperature separation to investigate the accuracy of globe thermometers on measuring MRTs. A radiantly heated open-plan laboratory and a radiantly cooled conference room were selected and measured with multiple globe thermometers and non-contacting infrared sensors. The globe temperature results were then corrected with air movement to produce MRTs and compared against MRTs simulated from measured surface temperatures. We demonstrate a significant impact of air speed on the MRTs obtained from globe thermometers. We also illustrate a less-investigated non-graybody emissivity variation and spatial variation of MRTs of up to 5 degrees C at the same height. We believe the increasing temporal and spatial resolution of digital sensors may create new challenges for using globe thermometers to measure MRTs, since fluctuating readings may camouflage potential MRT changes. Through a validation of our spatial MRT distribution with experimental results, we believe there is a need for better sensors that could spatially resolve MRTs, and recognize issues with both air speed and emissivity.

To expand our understanding of how species respond to environmental factors, we investigated the reproductive ecology of two ground-nesting species (northern bobwhite [Colinas virginianus] and scaled quail [Callipepla squamata]) in a region (i.e., the Southern Great Plains) prone to thermal variability (i.e., extreme hot and cold temperatures). Specifically, our objective was to examine how temperature and precipitation directly influenced behavioral adjustments (i.e., off-bout duration, frequency, and nest attentiveness) and parental decisions (i.e., nest site selection), and indirectly influenced nest fate. Overall, we found that parents chose to nest in sites that were significantly cooler in temperature than randomly selected sites, and parents further altered the thermal environment experienced by embryos through incubation behavior. Daily precipitation and average ambient temperature and/or their interaction best predicted incubation behaviors, yet each species differed in the timing (i.e., morning vs. evening), frequency, and duration of off-bouts. Furthermore, successful nests were associated with cooler nest site temperatures for bobwhite and warmer nest site temperatures for scaled quail. Our finding of relatively stable (35.5 degrees C) incubation temperature for developing embryos of both species suggests that ground-nesting birds are able to regulate microclimate through behavioral adjustments and parental decisions even under extreme temperature fluctuations. Nevertheless, the ability for a ground-nesting species to effectively modify behavioral adjustments and decisions may be altered during long periods of enhanced physiological and environmental stress.",,,,,"Fuhlendorf, Samuel/A-2931-2011","Fuhlendorf, Samuel/0000-0002-8726-9402",,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4565,,,,,MAY,2018,74,,,,,,140,148,,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.020,,,,,,,,29801620,,,,,WOS:000436526200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Soil temperatures were compared among soil-landscape types, and relative to overlying water temperature, ambient air temperature, and a tidal marsh soil. Subaqueous soil temperature varied slightly among soil-landscape types, and appears to be primarily influenced by water temperature and depth. Mean annual water temperatures (11.5-12.4 degrees C) were within 1 degrees C of the associated soil temperatures regardless of water depth suggesting that mean annual water temperature would serve as an excellent surrogate for mean annual soil temperature. Soil temperatures at the 50-cm depth showed less fluctuation than temperatures measured at 25 cm from the soil-water column interface. Mean annual soil temperatures measured at 50 cm were 12.3 and 12.6 degrees C in washover fan and lagoon bottom soils, respectively.

However, selective factors will often be more complex in natural populations than in laboratory environments and produce different patterns of adaptive differentiation. Here we test the ability of laboratory experimental evolution under different temperature cycles to reproduce well-known patterns of clinal variation in Drosophila melanogaster. Six fluctuating thermal regimes mimicking the natural temperature conditions along the east coast of Australia were initiated. Contrary to expectations, on the basis of field patterns there was no evidence for adaptation to thermal regimes as reflected by changes in cold and heat resistance after 1-3 years of laboratory natural selection. While laboratory evolution led to changes in starvation resistance, development time, and body size, patterns were not consistent with those seen in natural populations.

We investigated seed germination and survival of four leguminous species from a frequently burned open Neotropical savanna in Central Brazil. Three field experiments were conducted according to seed location in/on the soil: (1) fire effects on exposed seeds; (2) fire effects on buried seeds; and (3) effects of temperature fluctuations on exposed seeds in gaps and shaded microsites in vegetation. After field treatments, seeds were tested for germination in the laboratory, together with the control (non-treated seeds). Fire effects on exposed seeds decreased viability in all species. However, germination of buried Mimosa leiocephala seeds was enhanced by fire in an increased fuel load treatment, in which we doubled the amount of above-ground biomass. Germination of two species (M. leiocephala and Harpalyce brasiliana) was enhanced with temperature fluctuation in gaps, but this condition also decreased seed viability. Our main conclusions are: (1) most seeds died when exposed directly to fire; (2) PY could be alleviated during hotter fires when seeds were buried in the soil; and (3) daily temperature fluctuations in gaps also broke PY of seeds on the soil surface, so many seeds could be recruited or die before being incorporated into the soil seed banks.

Canopy growth, photosynthetically active radiation transmittance, net radiation, soil heat flux, and temperature were monitored in a two-year plastic mulch field experiment in Wuwei (Gansu Province, China). Results showed that the simulation of daily soil surface temperature had a good performance with 2.8 and 1.5 degrees C of root mean square error (RMSE) for the transparent film mulch (TM) and black film mulch (BM), respectively.

Physiological responses and energy expenditure (EE) measurements of housed and grazing goats were recorded at 06.00 h and 14.00 h for 5 consecutive days in each season. Goats were fixed with a face mask and meteorological balloon for collection of expired air and measurement of EE. Respiration rate (RR) at 06.00 h was similar in all seasons (14 respiration/min) except in the monsoon, where a significantly (P < 0.05) higher value (26 respiration/min) was recorded. At 14.00 h, RR was higher in monsoon and summer (81 and 91 respiration/min) than in winter (52 respiration/min).

Two ozone episodes during June 8-11, 2006 and July 18-22, 2006 characterized with hourly mixing ratios of 60100 ppbv, were selected for the study. Suite of sensitivity experiments were conducted with three different planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes and three land surface models (LSM). The results indicate that Yonsei-University (YSU) PBL scheme in combination with NOAH and SOIL LSMs produce better simulations of both the meteorological and chemical species than others. YSU PBL scheme in combination with NOAH LSM had slightly better simulation than with SOIL scheme. Spatial comparison with observations showed that YSUNOAH experiment well simulated the diurnal mean ozone mixing ratio, timing of diurnal cycle as well as range in ozone mixing ratio at most monitoring stations with an overall correlation of 0.726, bias of -1.55 ppbv, mean absolute error of 8.11 ppbv and root mean square error of 14.5 ppbv; and with an underestimation of 7 ppbv in the daytime peak ozone and about 8% in the daily average ozone. Model produced 1-hr, and 8-hr average ozone values were well correlated with corresponding observed means. The minor underestimation of daytime ozone is attributed to the slight underestimation of air temperature which tend to slow-down the ozone production and overestimation of wind speeds which transport the produced ozone at a faster rate. Simulated mean horizontal and vertical flow patterns suggest the role of the horizontal transport and the PBL diffusion in the development of high ozone during the episode. Overall, the model is found to perform reasonably well to simulate the ozone and other precursor pollutants with good correlations and low error metrics. Thus the study demonstrates the potential of WRF/Chem model for air quality prediction in coastal environments. (C) Author(s) 2012.

The sinusoidal-type temperature cycles were designed to evaluate the effects of passive, ambient temperature heating during arousal from torpor in these insectivorous marsupials. It was hypothesised that diel ambient temperature cycles may offer significant energy savings during arousal in animals that employ daily torpor in summer as a response to unpredictable food availability. The cost of arousal in animals in which passive, exogenous heating occurred was significantly lower than that in animals not exposed to an ambient temperature cycle. The total cost of all three phases of torpor (entry, maintenance and arousal) was almost halved when animals were exposed to an ambient heating cycle from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C over a 24-h period. In all animals, irrespective of the experimental ambient temperature cycle employed, the minimum torpor body temperature was 17-18 degrees C. The body temperature (T-b) of animals exposed to exogenous heating increased from the torpor T-b minimum to a mean value of 22.59 degrees C before endogenous heat production commenced. This relatively small increase in T-b of Ca. 5 degrees C through 'free' passive heating was sufficient to account for the significant ca. three-fold decrease in the cost of arousal and may represent an important energetic aid to free-ranging animals.",,,,,"Lovegrove, Barry G/D-1320-2009; Geiser, Fritz/O-4175-2018","Geiser, Fritz/0000-0001-7621-5049",,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,,,,,FEB,1999,169,1,,,,,11,18,,10.1007/s003600050188,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003600050188,,,,,,,,10093903,,,,,WOS:000078985100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The chief objective of the present study was to develop a functional model for the daily change in the total energy content of a brown trout, Salmo trutta, (equivalent to growth when positive) in relation to the difference between energy intake (energy content of food) and energy losses (metabolism + losses in faeces and excretory products). Energy budgets for individual fish were obtained in earlier experiments with 210 hatchery trout (live weight = 11-270 g) kept at fairly constant temperatures (mean values ranging from 3.6 to 20.4 degrees C), but without strict control of temperature or oxygen, and in later experiments, with 252 trout (1-300 g) bred from wild parents and kept at five constant temperatures (5, 10, 13, 15 and 18 degrees C) and 100% oxygen saturation. Each trout was fed a fixed ration of shrimps, Gammarus pulex, the ration level varying between zero and maximum. 2. Energy intake (C-IN, cal day(-1)) was measured directly and expressed as a proportion (p) of the maximum energy intake (C, cal day(-1)), the latter being estimated from a model developed earlier. In a new model, energy losses (C-Q, cal day(-1)) were expressed as a function of temperature, fish weight and ration level. This model was continuous over the 3.6-20.4 degrees C range, had twelve fitted parameters and was an excellent fit to the data for the 462 trout (P < 0.001, R-2 = 0.9970). In an extended model, the weight exponent for energy losses was not assumed equal to that for energy intake, the difference between the two exponents being very small, but significant, with a slight improvement in the fit of the model (R-2 increased to 0.9972). 3. The limits of model use were discussed. An example of its utility was to elucidate the complex relationships between both positive (growth) and negative daily changes in the total energy content of the trout, and temperature, fish size and variable energy intake. The model has raised several questions for future work, including the effect of increasing energy intake by a change of diet from invertebrates to fish or fish pellets, and a comparison of growth models based on weight or energy changes.",,,,,"Hurley, Margaret A/A-8875-2013","Hurley, Margaret A/0000-0002-2502-432X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,SEP,1999,42,2,,,,,235,246,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.444483.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.444483.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082837600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

To explore patterns of energy use and behavior during voluntary exercise, we developed methods allowing nearly continuous measurements of metabolic rates in freely behaving small mammals, with high temporal resolution over periods of several days. We used this approach to examine relationships between ambient temperature (T(a)), locomotor behavior and energy costs in the deer mouse, a small mammal that routinely encounters a large range of temperatures in its natural habitat. We tested for individual consistency in running behavior and metabolic traits, and determined how locomotor costs vary with speed and T(a). Because of the importance of thermoregulatory costs in small mammals, we checked for substitution of exercise heat for thermostatic heat production at T(a), below the thermal neutral zone and determined the fraction of the daily energy budget comprising exercise costs. Locomotor behavior was highly variable among individuals but had high repeatability, at least over short intervals. We found few temperature-related changes in speed or distance run, but T(a) strongly affected energy costs. Partial substitution of exercise heat for thermogenic heat occurred at low T(a). This reduced energy expenditure during low-temperature running by 23-37%, but running costs comprised a fairly minor fraction of the energy budget, so the daily energy savings via substitution were much smaller. Deer mice did not adjust running speed to maximize metabolic economy, as they seldom used the high speeds that provide the lowest cost of transport. The highest voluntary speeds (4-5 km h(-1)) were almost always below the predicted maximal aerobic speed, and were much less than the species' maximal sprint speed. Maximum voluntarily attained rates of oxygen consumption (V(O2)) were highest at low T(a), but rarely approached maximal V(O2) during forced treadmill exercise. Mean respiratory exchange ratios coincident with maximal voluntary V(O2) increased slightly as T(a) declined, but were always below 1.0 (another indication that metabolic rate was less than the aerobic maximum). Individuals with high running performance (cumulative distance and running time) had high resting metabolism, which suggests a cost of having high capacity or propensity for activity.",,,,,"Gomes, Fernando Ribeiro/C-5997-2012; Rezende, Enrico L./S-3219-2019; Rezende, Enrico L/B-8029-2012","Rezende, Enrico L./0000-0002-6245-9605; Rezende, Enrico L/0000-0002-6245-9605; Gomes, Fernando/0000-0003-2244-6161; Garland, Theodore/0000-0002-7916-3552",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,OCT,2004,207,22,,,,,3839,3854,,10.1242/jeb.01213,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.01213,,,,,,,,15472015,,,,,WOS:000225669600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, we have limited understanding of how often it occurs in variable environments. Whether phenotypic plasticity can evolve in distinct ways among populations experiencing different patterns of abiotic variability is unclear. Abiotic conditions in coastal marine habitats can be highly heterogeneous at small spatial scales, which might promote local adaptation. The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker, 1912) has become a model system for testing whether phenotypic differences among populations are a result of local adaptation. To identify potential selective pressures in the field, temperature and salinity were measured in high shore pools for six months at three sites on San Juan Island in Washington, USA. A common garden experiment with factorial combinations of seven temperature and two salinity (32, 55 ppt) treatments was conducted on these distinct populations. Two temperature treatments varied daily, both with an average of 20 C, but different ranges (low amplitude: 15-25 C, high amplitude: 10-30 C). The other five treatments were the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures held constant. Fecundity, survivorship, and development were characterized across two generations. There were strong interactive effects of temperature and hypersalinity on copepod culture dynamics, but these effects differed among populations. Abiotic patterns in the field were correlated with few observed differences in population phenotypes, thus limited evidence for local adaptation was found. For these populations, differences in selective pressures among sites might not be strong enough to overcome the influence of genetic drift.",,,,,,"Liguori, Alyssa/0000-0002-5645-6096",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,SEP,2022,554,,,,,,,,151752,10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151752,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2022.151752,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000812013400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Tissue nitrate content (TNC) was always higher for cv. Marbello' than for cv. Bastion', while solution heating had no effect on TNC for both of the cultivars tested.

Two cooling methods were examined, namely natural ventilation (NV) and fogging combined with natural ventilation (FNV). A fog system was operated cyclically with a temperature difference between the inside dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, when over 1 degrees C it was operated, and when under 0.5 degrees C it was stopped at 1 min intervals.

Here, we demonstrate that heat stability of function (indexed by the Michaelis-Menten constant of the cofactor NADH, K-M(NADH)) and structure (indexed by rate of denaturation) of cytosolic malate dehydrogenases (cMDHs) of two congeners (E. malaccana and E. radiata) exceeds values previously found for orthologs of this protein from less thermophilic species. The ortholog of E. malaccana is more heat stable than that of E. radiata, in keeping with the congeners' thermal environments. Only two inter-congener differences in amino acid sequence in these 332 residue proteins were identified. In both cases (positions 48 and 114), a glycine in the E. malaccana ortholog is replaced by a serine in the E. radiata protein. To explore the relationship between structure and function and to characterize how amino acid substitutions alter stability of different regions of the enzyme, we used molecular dynamics simulation methods. These computational methods allow determination of thermal effects on fine-scale movements of protein components, for example, by estimating the root mean square deviation in atom position over time and the root mean square fluctuation for individual residues. The minor changes in amino acid sequence favor temperature-adaptive change in flexibility of regions in and around the active sites.

In this case, cold tolerance is a key aspect for germination and successful turfgrass establishment. The germination response to sub-optimal temperatures was investigated for Cynodon dactylon (cvs Jackpot, La Paloma, Transcontinental, Yukon, Riviera), Buchloe dactyloides (cv SWI 2000) and Paspalum vaginatum (cv Pure Dynasty). Four temperature regimes were applied, i.e., 20/30 degrees C, 15/25 degrees C, 10/20 degrees C and 5/15 degrees C, with a 12:12 h (light:dark) photoperiod. Germination assays were performed twice, with six replicates (Petri dishes) per treatment in each experiment, fifty seeds per dish. The final germinated percentages at last inspection time (FGP) were obtained for each Petri dish and processed by using a generalized linear mixed model (binomial error and logit link). Germination curves were fitted to each Petri dish by using time-to-event methods and germination rates (GR) for the 10th, 20th and 30th percentiles were derived and used to fit a linear thermal-time model. For all cultivars, FGP decreased with decreasing mean daily temperatures. Base temperatures (Tb) ranged between 11.4 degrees C and 17.0 degrees C, while the thermal time to obtain 30% germination ranged from 51.3 degrees C day for SWI 2000 to 144.0 degrees C day for Pure Dynasty. The estimated parameters were used to predict germination time in the field, considering the observed soil temperatures in Legnaro. The estimated date for the beginning of germination in the field would range from early April for SWI 2000 and Transcontinental to mid-May for Riviera.

In particular, an estimate was made of the energetic cost of diving in order to determine the proportion of dives that may exceed the calculated aerobic dive limit (cADL; estimated usable O-2 stores/estimated rate of oxygen consumption during diving). An implanted data logger enabled fH and diving behaviour to be monitored from 10 free-ranging king penguins during their breeding period. Using previously determined calibration equations, it was possible to estimate rate of oxygen consumption (V-O2) when the birds were ashore and during various phases of their foraging trips. Diving behaviour showed a clear diurnal pattern, with a mixture of deep (>40 m), long (>3 min) and shallow (<40 m), short (<3 min) dives from dawn to dusk and shallow, short dives at night. Heart rate during dive bouts and dive cycles (dive + post-dive interval) was 42% greater than that when the birds were ashore. During diving, fH was similar to the 'ashore' value (87+/-4 beats min(-1)), but it did decline to 76% of the value recorded from king penguins resting in water. During the first hour after a diving bout, fH was significantly higher than the average value during diving (101+/-4 beats min(-1)) and for the remainder of the dive bout. Rates of oxygen consumption estimated from these (and other) values of fH indicate that when at sea, metabolic rate (MR) was 83% greater than that when the birds were ashore [3.15 W kg(-1) (-0.71, +0.93), where the values in parentheses are the computed standard errors of the estimate], while during diving bouts and dive cycles, it was 73% greater than the 'ashore' value. Although estimated MR during the total period between dive bouts was not significantly different from that during dive bouts [5.44 W kg(-1) (-0.30, +0.32)], MR during the first hour following a dive bout was 52% greater than that during a diving bout. It is suggested that this large increase following diving (foraging) activity is, at least in part, the result of rewarming the body, which occurs at the end of a diving bout. From the measured behaviour and estimated values of V-O2, it was evident that approximately 35% of the dives were in excess of the cADL. Even if V-O2 during diving was assumed to be the same as when the birds were resting on water, approximately 20% of dives would exceed the cADL. As V-O2, during diving is, in fact, that estimated for a complete dive cycle, it is quite feasible that V-O2 during diving itself is less than that measured for birds resting in water. It is suggested that the regional hypothermia that has been recorded in this species during diving bouts may be at least a contributing factor to such hypometabolism.",,,,,"Fahlman, Andreas/A-2901-2011; Fahlman, Andreas/K-2256-2019; Handrich, Yves/AAD-6472-2022","Fahlman, Andreas/0000-0002-8675-6479; Fahlman, Andreas/0000-0002-8675-6479; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,OCT,2004,207,22,,,,,3917,3926,,10.1242/jeb.01232,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.01232,,,,,,,,15472022,,,,,WOS:000225669600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

(2) Is there a point at which adding additional mass to a space will not reduce the internal diurnal temperature range during summer beyond its current range? The review of existing rules of thumb concluded that an effective measure for the quantity of mass in a space is represented as a relationship between the amount of thermal capacity in a space and the volume of the space. It is known that adding thermal capacity to a space reduces the diurnal variation of the ambient air temperature in that space. Is there a point when additional mass will not reduce the diurnal variation further? This paper reports work using thermal simulation modelling and analogue test cell buildings where the quantity of thermal capacity in a space is changed incrementally and the ambient air temperature is observed.

Across the years and climatic regions, the major driver for the yield difference was found to be the diurnal temperature range (DTR) and accumulated photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). 1 degrees C decrease in DTR and 100 MJ decrease in accumulated PAR resulted in 1.0 t ha(-1) and 0.85 t ha(-1) reduction in maize grain yield, respectively. 1 degrees C increase in growing season mean temperature (Tmean) and minimum temperature (Tmin) resulted in 0.83 t ha(-1) and 0.67 t ha(-1) maize grain yield reduction. By mimicking the effect of climate change on maize grain yield, it was found that 1 degrees C increase in Tmean resulted in 0.83 t ha(-1) (5.8%) maize grain yield reduction. Decrease in PAR also decreased maize grain yield significantly and the 1% decrease in PAR decreased maize grain yield by 0.15 tons per ha.

J,"Li, HS",,,,"Li, Hongshou",,,Exploring the Source and Potential of Earth-Air Pulsation Using a Closed System,EARTH INTERACTIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Because of Earth's motion, periodic temperature fluctuations occur in soil on daily and yearly time scales, which inevitably lead to pulsation of the air pressure in the soil. The Earth-air pressure monitoring technique called hou-qi is the basis of a calendar formulated by the ancient Chinese. However, the daily/yearly variation of air pressure in the soil is very weak, according to practical monitoring experiments, so hou-qi has long been considered a pseudoscience. To determine the potential maximum change of Earth-air pressure, identify what is causing the underlying Earth-air pressure variation, and reveal the mechanism, we use a closed system, which is a more appropriate system test of the possible validity of hou-qi, to monitor Earth-air pressure variation in this paper. The results show that there are potential air pressure fluctuations of about 120-190 hPa in closed soil over the daily/yearly temperature range of 5 degrees-40 degrees C. This provides ample magnitude for hou-qi. The largest contribution made to Earth-air pressure variation was pressurization due to air warming, with vapor due to water evaporation and desorbed gas having smaller effects. The soil's water content has a significant effect on Earth-air pressure amplitude. Dry soil contributes almost no water vapor, but the adsorbed gases from dry soil have up to a 38-hPa influence on air pressure. The soil's salt content also has an important regulating role on Earth-air pressure and can reduce the influence of vapor pressure. This paper provides a scientific basis for the ancient Earth-air monitoring system of hou-qi and also has important significance for hydrometeorology and research on the ancient Chinese civilization.",,,,,,"Li, Hongshou/0000-0001-8588-122X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1087-3562,,,,,MAY,2018,22,9,,,,,1,13,,10.1175/EI-D-17-0019.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/EI-D-17-0019.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000432573900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In many species, however, the behavioral component of temperature selection is not well understood. This study addresses the thermoregulatory behavior of the common brown shrimp (Crangon crangon, L.), which is a central component of the Wadden Sea ecosystem and an important fishery resource of high commercial value. To investigate whether brown shrimp are thermosensitive and perform behavioral thermoregulation, we examined the short- and long-term thermoregulatory behavior by using the acute and gravitational method for temperature preference testing. For the acute method, female adult brown shrimp were acclimated to 5 temperatures between 9 degrees C and 19 degrees C for two weeks. For the gravitational method, the shrimp were acclimated to 3 temperatures within the same range. Hereafter, thermal preferenda were determined in an annular shaped preference chamber. Acute and gravitational thermal preference experiments revealed brown shrimp to be thermosensitive and perform behavioral thermoregulation. Using the acute method, a positive correlation of acclimation and preferred temperature was observed, resulting in a final thermal preferendum of 15.9 degrees C. In experiments using the gravitational method, preference temperature was heavily modulated by the photoperiod, with brown shrimp selecting temperatures more precisely during the scotophase than the photophase. Determined at dark exclusively, however, no effect of acclimation temperature on gravitational preference after 24 and 48 h was observed. Preferenda ranged between 13.5-15.0 degrees C after 24 h and 12.0-14.9 degrees C after 48 h, respectively, and no significant differences between both methods were detected. Based on these findings, 20-24 h of gradient exposure can be considered sufficient to obtain thermal preferenda that are unaffected by the animal's prior thermal history. Thermal preferenda determined in the present study were higher than the average temperature experienced by brown shrimp in the field. Still, thermal preferenda were considerably lower than previously reported optimum temperatures for brown shrimp. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

According to the scientific literature, the most accurate method for in-field T-mr calculation is integral radiation measurements with three net radiometers. Nevertheless, net radiometers are expensive sensors and their implementation on large scale may be hindered by their price. To provide a cost-effective alternative some researchers proposed the use of globe thermometers. Globe thermometers are affordable sensors but typically exploited indoors, and their accuracy in urban settings is still under investigation. The scope of this work is to provide information regarding the extent to which globe thermometers can substitute net radiometers in the evaluation of the T-mr in outdoor urban settings. To this purpose, an experimental comparison has been performed between the T-mr calculated using net radiometers, assumed as a reference, and using two different globe thermometers: a standard 150 mm black globe and a grey 50 mm globe. The results revealed that the black globe tends to overestimate the T-mr while the grey globe mainly underestimates it. Moreover, the analyses evidenced a wide fluctuation in the profile of the T-mr calculated using globe thermometers, due to the rapid variation of meteorological parameters and the globes' long response time. To improve the fit between globe thermometers and net radiometers' response, regressive functions have been proposed, resulting in a significant enhancement of the adherence between T-mr calculated using the standard black globe's measurements and the reference T-mr.",,,,,,"Tatti, Anita/0000-0002-2110-9705; Banfi, Alessia/0000-0001-7742-6067; FERRANDO, MARTINA/0000-0003-4060-256X; Zanghirella, Fabio/0000-0001-9332-9267",,,,,,,,,,,,,0360-1323,1873-684X,,,,AUG 15,2022,222,,,,,,,,109373,10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109373,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109373,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000831086700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Daily temperature amplitudes (DTAs) can significantly impact the traits of insects but there is limited evidence from the natural environment. Therefore, we studied the acclimation effects of DTA on the longevity, total fecundity, early fecundity, and thermal tolerance of adult diamondback moths (Plutella xylostella) under environmental conditions. The longevity, total fecundity, early fecundity, and heat thermal tolerance of adults significantly changed under different DTAs. These findings highlight the effects of DTA on the acclimation response in the P. xylostella phenotype, and DTA should be incorporated into prediction models for assessing insect populations and the effects of climate change. Daily temperature amplitudes (DTAs) significantly affect the ecological and physiological traits of insects. Most studies in this field are based on laboratory experiments, while there is limited research on the effects of changes in DTA on insect phenotypic plasticity under natural conditions. Therefore, we studied the acclimation effects of DTA on the longevity, total fecundity, early fecundity, and the thermal tolerance of adult diamondback moths (Plutella xylostella L.) under naturally occurring environmental conditions. As DTAs increased, male longevity and total fecundity decreased, and early fecundity increased. An increase in DTA was significantly associated with the increased heat coma temperature (CTmax) of both males and females, but had no significant effect on their cold coma temperature (CTmin).

Subsequent monitoring of individuals continued for an additional 58 days (72 total) within the larger VR2 array.

In contrast, average daily home range increased gradually with increasing body size, and study-length displacements showed a dichotomy between juveniles and adolescents/adults.

Potato yellow vein virus (PYVV) of the genus Crinivirus (Closteroviridae) is transmitted in a semi-persistent manner by the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). Although several approaches exist for modeling insect population growth, modeling vector-born virus spread remains difficult because fundamental knowledge on the relationship between virus transmission and temperature is lacking for most vector transmitted viruses. To address this challenge, we initially developed a temperature-dependent phenology model for the whitefly vector using the Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software. In the present study, the effect of temperature on the efficiency of virus transmission by the whitefly was determined through controlled laboratory experiments at 8 constant temperatures in the range from 10 to 25 degrees C. The vector capacity to transmit the virus was highest at 15 degrees C (about 70 % probability of infection) but decreased radically as temperature deviated from this optimum temperature to < 10 % at temperatures of 10 and 20 degrees C, respectively. The temperature-dependent probability of virus transmission by a single adult whitefly could be described by a nonlinear function, which was validated by transmission frequencies observed at fluctuating temperatures. This function combined with life table parameters calculated from previously established temperature-dependent phenology model for the vector provided a full temperature-responsive model for predicting PYVV spread potential and transmission probabilities. For spatial risk predictions, we devised two virus transmission risk indexes and tested their performance in correctly predicting virus presence/absence with field survey data. The best performing risk index was used to generate risk maps, which reflected well the current (real) occurrence of the virus but also predicted areas at high risk, where the virus has not previously been reported. One of them in western Panama was targeted for surveillance and resulted in identification of the virus in the country, where it was not previously known to occur. Simulated risk maps for the year 2050 revealed that climate change may significantly affect, the risk of distribution, generally reducing in tropical areas of the world, but increasing in the temperate regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1702,1872-7492,,,,NOV,2020,289,,,,,,,,198109,10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198109,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198109,,,,,,,,32781096,,,,,WOS:000580625200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Four sets of experiments meeting the necessary requirement of feeding the pigs ad libitum and reporting sufficient information on trial conditions were chosen to test the model. The parameters used in the model to describe the kind of pig were protein weight at maturity (P-m) the Gompertz rate parameter (B) and the ratio of mature lipid weight (L-m) to P-m. Values for P-m and B used to apply to the pigs in the four experiments were selected as those which gave the maximum daily gains equal to those reported at thermoneutral temperatures on diets not limiting in protein. The value of L-m was chosen as that which gave a value for food conversion ratio close to that seen in the experiment, again at a thermoneutral temperature and on a non-limiting diet. The model was run for each of the experiments from the given start weight until slaughter weight was reached. All pigs were assumed to have their desired bodily composition at the start of the experimental period, which is determined by their genetic descriptors and weight. From the conditions of the experiments, average daily gain (ADG) average daily food intake (ADFI) food conversion ratio (FCR) final body weight, body composition, average daily gains of each of the chemical body components and heat production (HP) were predicted. Generally as temperature increased or the crude protein content of the food increased, ADFI, ADG and the fatness of the pig decreased, whilst protein content increased. Quantitative differences between the model predictions and the observations, were probably due to the greater sensitivity of the model to temperature. This is likely to reflect the omission of long-term adaptation and acclimatization, or to incorrect estimation of the wetness of the pig's skin. However, model predictions were generally in good quantitative agreement with the observed data over the wide range of treatments tested. This gives support to the value and accuracy of the model for predicting pig performance when the thermal and nutritional environments are manipulated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1357-7298,,,,,OCT,2003,77,,2,,,,267,276,,10.1017/S1357729800059002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1357729800059002,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000222787000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

After temperature correction, both data sets suggest that this relationship might be described by a unimodal quadratic curve with the modal size (the size corresponding to the maximal growth rate) being 2.8 and 5.4 mu m in the C-14 and dilution data sets, respectively. Nutrient enrichment does not change the qualitative nature of the relationships, and we conclude that inherently low maximal growth rates of picophytoplankton, not ambient nutrient effects, play the major role in determining the positive relationships over the size range where phytoplankton size is below the modal size. Temperature-corrected phytoplankton grazing mortality rate is positively correlated with phytoplankton average size, but the proportion of daily primary production consumed by microzooplankton is negatively correlated with cell size, suggesting a reduced grazing effect as size increases. The unimodal relationship between phytoplankton growth rate and cell size is consistent with theoretical considerations and might reflect an adaptive response of phytoplankton to varying extents of nutrient limitation and grazing effect in marine systems.",,,,,"Liu, Hongbin/AAV-8862-2020; Chen, Bingzhang/D-4734-2011","Chen, Bingzhang/0000-0002-1573-7473",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,MAY,2010,55,3,,,,,965,972,,10.4319/lo.2010.55.3.0965,http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2010.55.3.0965,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000277650900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The rate of vertical change in depth during these 'drift' dives is largely a result of the proportion of lipid tissue in the body, with fatter seals having higher (more positive or less negative) drift rates compared with leaner seals. We examined the temporal changes in drift rates of 24 newly weaned southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) pups during their first trip to sea to determine if this easily recorded dive characteristic can be used to continuously monitor changes in body composition of seals throughout their foraging trips. All seals demonstrated a similar trend over time: drift rates were initially positive but decreased steadily over the first 30-50 days after departure (Phase 1), corresponding to seals becoming gradually less buoyant. Over the following similar to100 days (Phase 2), drift rates again increased gradually, while during the last similar to20-45 days (Phase 3) drift rates either remained constant or decreased slightly. The daily rate of change in drift rate was negatively related to the daily rate of horizontal displacement (daily travel rate), and daily travel rates of more than similar to80 km were almost exclusively associated with negative changes in drift rate. We developed a mechanistic model based on body compositions and morphometrics measured in the field, published values for the density of seawater and various body components, and values of drag coefficients for objects of different shapes. We used this model to examine the theoretical relationships between drift rate and body composition and carried out a sensitivity analysis to quantify errors and biases caused by varying model parameters. While variations in seawater density and uncertainties in estimated body surface area and volume are unlikely to result in errors in estimated lipid content of more than +/-2.5%, variations in drag coefficient can lead to errors of greater than or equal to10%. Finally, we compared the lipid contents predicted by our model with the lipid contents measured using isotopically labelled water and found a strong positive correlation. The best-fitting model suggests that the drag coefficient of seals while drifting passively is between similar to0.49 (roughly corresponding to a sphere-shaped object) and 0.69 (a prolate spheroid), and we were able to estimate relative lipid content to within approximately +/-2% lipid. Our results suggest that this simple method can be used to estimate the changes in lipid content of free-ranging seals while at sea and may help improve our understanding of the foraging strategies of these important marine predators.",,,,,"Fedak, Michael A/B-3987-2009; Biuw, Martin/AAF-9895-2021; Bradshaw, Corey J.A./A-1311-2008; McConnell, Bernie/G-6553-2019","Fedak, Michael A/0000-0002-9569-1128; Bradshaw, Corey J.A./0000-0002-5328-7741; Biuw, Martin/0000-0001-8051-3399; McConnell, Bernie/0000-0001-7575-5270",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,OCT,2003,206,19,,,,,3405,3423,,10.1242/jeb.00583,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.00583,,,,,,,,12939372,,,,,WOS:000187393400018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sowing date experiments are a practical and inexpensive approach for comparison of large collections of lines. Late-sown crops usually experience hotter conditions and phenotypes thus partially capture this environmental influence. Two sets of confounded factors, however, limit the value of sowing date trials. First, daily mean temperature correlates with both minimum and maximum temperature, photoperiod, radiation and vapour pressure deficit, and it may also correlate with rainfall. Second, temperature alters the genotype-dependent phenology of crops, effectively shifting the timing and duration of critical periods against the background of temperature and other environmental variables. Here we advance a crop-level framework to unscramble the confounded effects of sowing date experiments; it is based on four physiological concepts: (1) annual crops accommodate environmental variation through seed number rather than seed size; (2) seed number is most responsive to the environment in species-specific critical windows; (3) non-stressful thermal effects affecting seed set through development and canopy size can be integrated in a photothermal quotient relating intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and mean temperature during the critical window; (4) stressful temperature reduces yield by disrupting reproduction. The framework was tested in a factorial experiment combining four chickpea varieties with putatively contrasting adaptation to thermal stress and five environments resulting from the combination of seasons and sowing dates. Yield ranged from 13 to 577 gm. Shifts in phenology led to contrasting photothermal conditions in the critical window between flowering and 400 degrees C d after flowering that were specific for each variety-environment combination. The photothermal quotient ranged from 2.72 to 6.85 Mi m(-2)degrees C-1; it explained 50% of the variation in yield and maximum temperature explained 32% of the remaining variation. Thus, half of the variation in yield was associated with developmental, non-stressful thermal effect and (at most) 16% of the variation was attributable to thermal stress. The photothermal quotient corrected by vapour pressure deficit accounted for by 75% of the variation in yield and provided further insight on photosynthesis-mediated responses to temperature. Crop adaptation to non-stressful, developmental thermal effects and stressful temperatures disrupting reproduction involve different physiological processes and requires partially different agronomic and breeding solutions. Our analytical approach partially separates these effects, adds value to sowing date trials, and is likely to return more robust rankings of varieties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The germination of conidia was modelled by a generalized beta-modified Chapman Richards function, and the germ tube length was modelled by a generalized beta-power function. Conidia germinated in a wide temperature range, with an optimum at 23.3 degrees C, whereas germ tube length had a narrow nearly optimum temperature range around 28.7 degrees C, which indicates that infection by conidia is more restricted by germ tube growth than by germination. The effect of temperature on the number of lesions produced by two strains on green asparagus spears had the narrowest optimum range (optimum at 21.9 degrees C) of all parts of the polycyclic phase.

Comparing phenotypes for four treatments corresponding to a full-factorial analysis of cooler and warmer temperatures, we found evidence of significant interaction effects between day and night temperatures. We then focused on comparing phenotypes between individuals reared under two types of temperature fluctuations (warmer days with cooler nights, and cooler days with warmer nights) and individuals reared under a constant temperature of the same daily mean. We found evidence of additive-like effects (for body size), and different types of dominance-like effects, with one particular period of the light cycle (for development time) or one particular extreme temperature (for eyespot size) having a larger impact on phenotype.

This remaining error is not always random but is shown to be correlated to the air-sea temperature difference. The MCSST technique is modeled and then compared to in situ data to show this dependency. Atmospheric radiative transfer calculations are used to provide a simulation of satellite retrieval sensitivity to air-sea temperature differences. Buoy sea surface temperature (SST) and air temperature observations are then presented as experimental verification of the simulation results. Retrieval errors depend both on the mean air-sea temperature difference conditions present in the data set used to empirically derive the algorithm and on the changes in air-sea temperature difference conditions relative to the derivation data set mean conditions. Retrieval error is found to respond linearly with air-sea temperature difference changes. MCSST retrieval errors of 1.0-degrees-C can occur for air-sea temperature difference changes of 7-degrees-10-degrees-C from mean conditions when the dual-window (channels 3 and 4) or triple-window (channels 3, 4, and 5) algorithms are used. The split-window (channels 4 and 5) MCSST algorithm is shown to be less sensitive to air-sea temperature differences. Cross-product SST (CPSST) and nonlinear SST (NLSST) algorithms are also examined. These algorithms generate results similar to the MCSST algorithm for the dual- and triple-window equations. However, the CPSST and NLSST split-window algorithms demonstrate greater sensitivity to air-sea temperature difference changes than do the MCSST split-window algorithm. Retrieval errors of 1-degrees-C can occur for air-sea temperature difference changes of 10-degrees-12-degrees-C from mean conditions. Users of satellite SST retrievals in regions that experience large fluctuations in air-sea temperature difference should be aware of this possible error source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,JUL 15,1993,98,C7,,,,,12567,12577,,10.1029/93JC00913,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JC00913,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LN31000022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Determining the trigger that makes soil moisture as the primary control factor of SR will provide a deeper understanding on how SR changes under the projected future increase in droughts. Specific objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the seasonal variations and the relationship between SR and both soil temperature and moisture in a Mediterranean riparian forest along a groundwater level gradient; (2) to determine soil moisture thresholds at which SR is controlled by soil moisture rather than by temperature; (3) to compare SR responses under different tree species present in a Mediterranean riparian forest (Alnus glutinosa, Populus nigra and Fraxinus excelsior). Results showed that the heterotrophic soil respiration rate, groundwater level and 30 cm integral soil moisture (SM30) decreased significantly from the riverside moving uphill and showed a pronounced seasonality. SR rates showed significant differences between tree species, with higher SR for P. nigra and lower SR for A. glutinosa. The lower threshold of soil moisture was 20 and 17% for heterotrophic and total SR, respectively.

We designed a long-term (8 months) mesocosm experiment to explore how ambient water temperature (C: control), induced increased temperature (T: +4 degrees C), and temperature fluctuations (F: +/- 4 degrees C relative to T) change phytoplankton phenology, taxonomical diversity, and community structure, and how such changes affected zooplankton abundance and composition.

Moreover, there was a clear effect of the temperature treatments (T and F) on phytoplankton size structure that resulted in a significantly lower growth of large species (i.e., large Chlorophyta) compared to C.

The roles played by alterations in gene expression in enabling eurytherms to adjust to these two temporally distinct patterns of thermal stress are poorly understood. We used cDNA microarray analysis to examine changes in gene expression in a eurythermal fish, Austrofundulus limnaeus, subjected to long-term acclimation to constant temperatures of 20, 26 and 37degreesC and to environmentally realistic daily fluctuations in temperature between 20degreesC and 37degreesC. Our data reveal major differences between the transcriptional responses in the liver made during acclimation to constant temperatures and in response to daily temperature fluctuations. Control of cell growth and proliferation appears to be an important part of the response to change in temperature, based on large-scale changes in mRNA transcript levels for several key regulators of these pathways. However, cell growth and proliferation appear to be regulated by different genes in constant versus fluctuating temperature regimes. The gene expression response of molecular chaperones is also different between constant and fluctuating temperatures. Small heat shock proteins appear to play an important role in response to fluctuating temperatures whereas larger molecular mass chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 respond more strongly to chronic high temperatures. A number of transcripts that encode for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of nitrogen-containing organic osmolytes have gene expression patterns that indicate a possible role for these 'chemical chaperones' during acclimation to chronic high temperatures and daily temperature cycling. Genes important for the maintenance of membrane integrity are highly responsive to temperature change. Changes in fatty acid saturation may be important in long-term acclimation and in response to fluctuating temperatures; however cholesterol metabolism may be most critical for short-term acclimation to fluctuating temperatures. The variable effect of temperature on the expression of genes with daily rhythms of expression indicates that there is a complex interaction between the temperature cycle and daily rhythmicity in gene expression. A number of new hypotheses concerning temperature acclimation in fish have been generated as a result of this study. The most notable of these hypotheses is the possibility that the high mobility group b1 (HMGB1) protein, which plays key roles in the assembly of transcription initiation and enhanceosome complexes, may act as a compensatory modulator of transcription in response to temperature, and thus as a global gene expression temperature sensor.

Most tests of the model focus on morphological proxies of fitness, such as size traits, whereas early life physiological traits that are closely related to lifetime fitness might provide a framework for generalizing the Charnov-Bull model across taxa. One such trait is the strength of the early-life immune response, which is strongly linked to early-life survival and fitness. Here, we manipulated temperature, variance in temperature, and sex to test the Charnov-Bull model using a physiological trait, immune system strength, in the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina). We found no evidence of sex-specific differences in bactericidal capacity of hatchling blood, and no evidence that mean temperature influences bactericidal capacity. However, we did find that fluctuating incubation temperature (i.e. a more naturalized incubation regime) is associated with a greater bactericidal capacity compared with constant temperature incubation. We also found that egg mass, a proxy for maternal provisioning, is positively associated with bactericidal capacity. Our findings suggest that the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles is unrelated to our measure of early-life innate immunity.

Although Drosophila melanogaster develops smaller cells at fluctuating temperatures, we do not know whether this response depends on the frequency or amplitude of thermal change. In a laboratory experiment, we exposed flies to either frequent or infrequent fluctuations between 17 and 27 degrees C, while controlling the total exposure to each temperature. Flies emerged from these treatments with similar body sizes, but flies at more frequent fluctuations emerged earlier and had smaller epidermal cells for a given body size. Tissue built from small cells has more nuclei for transcription, shorter distances between cell compartments, and a larger surface area for transport across membranes. Therefore, we hypothesize that physiological effects of small cells reduce lags in metabolic activity and enhance performance of flies during warming. For plasticity of cell size to confer a fitness advantage, this hypothetical benefit must outweigh the cost of maintaining a greater area of plasma membrane. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The study area is located in the Canterbury Plains in the South Island of New Zealand. Time series of LST from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) have been analysed statistically to study the relationship between the surface skin temperature and near-surface SM. In-situ measurements of the skin temperature and surface SM with a quasi-experimental design over multiple LC types are used for validation. Correlations between MODIS LST and in-situ SM, as well as in-situ surface temperature and SM are calculated. The in-situ measurements and MODIS data are collected from various LC types. Pearson's r correlation coefficient and linear regression are used to fit the MODIS LST and surface skin temperature with near-surface SM. There was no significant correlation between time-series of MODIS LST and near-surface SM from the initial analysis, however, careful analysis of the data showed significant correlation between the two parameters. Night-time series of the in-situ surface temperature and SM from a 12 hour period over Irrigated-Crop, Mixed-Grass, Forest, Barren and Open-Grass showed inverse correlations of -0.47, -0.68, -0.74, -0.88 and -0.93, respectively. These results indicated that the relationship between near-surface SM and LST in short-terms (12 to 24 hours) is strong, however, remotely sensed LST with higher temporal resolution is required to establish this relationship in such time-scales.

Although this degree of reduction appeared to take longer to invoke when starting from higher metabolic rates, tegu lizards reduced their metabolism to the low rates seen in winter dormancy at all times of the year when given sufficient time in the cold and dark. In the spring and summer, tegus reduced their standard metabolic rate (SMR) by 80%-90% over the experimental run, but only roughly 20%-30% of the total fall was due to the reduction in temperature; 70%-80% of the total fall occurred at constant temperature. By autumn, when the starting SMR on the first night at 25 degrees C was already reduced by 59%-81% (early and late autumn, respectively) from peak summer values, virtually all of the fall (63%-83%) in metabolism was due to the reduction in temperature.

This study was conducted in 1997 to test the hypothesis that isolates representing immigrant strains of Phytophthora infestans were more adapted at causing stem lesions and more aggressive at higher temperatures than isolates representing the relatively older US-1 strain. A total of 23 Phytophthora infestans isolates representing US-1, US-8, and a new A1 compatibility type strain were tested for aggressiveness on leaflets and stems of whole potato plants (cv. Russet Burbank) in 11 trials. Plants in one set of trials were incubated at constant temperatures of 18, 23, and 28 A degrees C for six days with a 16 h photoperiod. Plants in the second set of trials were incubated at the same three day temperatures but the night temperature in all treatments was reduced to 16 A degrees C. Lesion establishment was recorded, and daily severity readings were used to calculate the area under the lesion expansion curve (AULEC). Lesion area, sporulation frequency, sporulation time, and sporulation capacity were also measured. Lesion establishment was higher on stems than on leaves for isolates of all strains. Isolates representing US-8 and new A1 strains often had higher AULEC values but had similar lesion establishment, sporulation frequency, sporulation time, and sporulation capacity values as US-1 isolates. A reduction in components of aggressiveness for all strains was noted at 28 A degrees C, with leaflets being more affected than stems. Sporulation rarely occurred at 28 A degrees C. Few differences in components of aggressiveness were observed between 18 and 23 A degrees C. These findings indicate that isolates from the relatively newer strains (US-8 and new A1) were not better adapted in causing lesions on potato stems than isolates from the old US-1 strain, nor were they better adapted to higher temperatures. The relatively newer strains, however, were generally more aggressive as indicated by higher AULEC on stems and leaflets over the range of temperatures used in this experiment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1099-209X,1874-9380,,,,OCT,2014,91,5,,,,,538,553,,10.1007/s12230-014-9387-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-014-9387-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000343049900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature change at +/- 5 A degrees C was used to simulate the diurnal variation of soil temperature between night (-5 A degrees C, 12 h) and day (5 A degrees C, 12 h) during the corresponding freeze-thaw cycles. Our results showed that both increased soil temperature and moisture significantly promoted straw aerobic decomposition as observed by carbon dioxide (CO2) production, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and its delta C-13 value in this incubation experiment. During the anaerobic incubation, straw-amended soil samples remarkably promoted CH4 production and CH4/total decomposed C. Both CH4 and CO2 productions in straw-amended soil samples were lowest at 25 A degrees C and 100 % WFPS and highest at +/- 5 A degrees C and 100 % WFPS, which could be attributed to a depletion of labile organic C derived from straw during the 24-week aerobic incubation. Total rates of straw C decomposition calculated from decomposed C production, SOC content, and delta C-13 value in the whole incubation (aerobic + anaerobic) ranged from 29.8 to 48.1, 45.0 to 64.2, and 25.7 to 35.7 %, respectively.

Morphological, behavioral and physiological features contribute to the terrapin's ability to regulate body fluid osmotic pressure in a euryhaline environment. Low integument permeability combined with aquatic-terrestrial shuttling behavior limits passive exchange of water and salts with the environment, and terrapins regulate active uptake of salts via alterations in drinking and feeding behavior. The lachrymal salt gland facilitates excretion of excess sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions through active transport mechanisms. We investigated body fluid dynamics, oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2) and osmotic status of terrapins exposed to an acute increase in salinity (12 to 35 psu) at 10 and 25 degrees C to gain insight into the relative importance of behavioral versus physiological osmoregulatory adjustments over a range of seasonally relevant temperatures. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of experimental temperature, salinity and mass. Overall, temperature effects were stronger than salinity effects. Terrapins acclimated to 25 degrees C had significantly lower blood osmolality and Na+, and higher water turnover rates, daily water flux (DWF) and (V) over dot O-2 compared with terrapins acclimated to 10 degrees C.

Climate change will lead to shifts in soil temperature and moisture; therefore, to create a more accurate forecast of ecosystem sustainability, it is important to understand how these indicators control nitrogen mineralization in soils. We studied the effect of temperature and moisture on the net ammonification and net nitrification processes in temperate peatlands of central Russia under 4 land-use types: regular plowing for 50 and 100 years, post-agrogenic reforestation for 50 years, and a near-pristine birch forest. During a laboratory incubation experiment, we found that net nitrogen mineralization was significant at all combinations of temperatures and moisture levels. Net nitrification was the main process for nitrogen mineralization, although net ammonification was also possible at low incubation temperatures. The highest rate of net mineralization was typical of forest peatlands, and the lowest rate was typical of arable sites, which were associated with the differences in the quantity, quality and regularity of the incoming plant litter. Despite significant differences in the rate of net nitrification between plots with different land-uses, the temperature sensitivity coefficient of this process was nearly the same for all peatlands and was close to 2; therefore, we did not find evidence of the effect of the organic matter quality on the temperature sensitivity of net nitrification. The moisture level also did not affect the temperature sensitivity of this process. In general, it was found that fluctuations in soil temperature and moisture with climate change will not cause a sharp increase in net nitrification in peatlands, which will prevent the soil from losing nitrogen with runoff or in the form of gaseous compounds, such as N2O.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0341-8162,1872-6887,,,,MAR,2022,210,,,,,,,,105922,10.1016/j.catena.2021.105922,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105922,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000790433700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Obligate heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inocula, because of their ability to inhibit yeasts, have been developed to prevent the aerobic deterioration of silages. The temperature during silage conservation may also play an important role in the fermentation profile of silages. This study has evaluated the effect of temperature, during the conservation of whole crop corn silage, untreated or treated with different LAB inocula, on the fermentation profile and on the aerobic stability of the silage. Corn was harvested at 42% dry matter arid either not treated (control) or treated with Lactobacillus buchneri NCIMB 40788 (LB) at 300,000 cfu/g fresh matter (FM); Lactobacillus hilgardii CNCM 1-4785 at 150,000 cfu/g FM (LH150); L. hilgardii CNCM 1-4785 at 300,000 cfu/g FM (LH300); or LB+LH at 150,000 cfu/g FM each. In an attempt to experimentally simulate temperature fluctuations in the mass or at the periphery of a silage bunker, corn was conserved in laboratory silos at a constant temperature (20 +/- 1 degrees C; MASS) or at lower and variable outdoor temperatures (PERIPH; ranging from 0.5 to 19 degrees C), and the silos were opened after 15, 30, and 100 d of conservation. Lactic acid, acetic acid, and ethanol contents increased in all the silages over the conservation period. The lactic acid content was higher (+10%) in the silages kept at a constant temperature than those conserved at the lower and variable outdoor temperatures. The acetic acid was higher in the treated silages than in the control ones conserved at a constant temperature for 100 d. Moreover, 1,2-propanediol was only detected in the treated silages after at least 30 d at a constant temperature, whereas only traces were detected in the LB+LII treatment for the other temperature conditions. The yeast count decreased during conservation at a slower rate in PERIPH than in MASS and on average reached 2.96 and 4.71 log cfu/g for MASS and PERIPH, respectively, after 100 d of conservation. The highest aerobic stability values were observed for LH300 (191 h) in the MASS silage after 100 d of conservation, whereas the highest aerobic stability was observed in LB+LH (150 h) in the PERIPH silages. After 7 d of air exposure, a pH higher than 4.5 and a higher yeast than 8.0 log cfu/g were detected in all the silages opened after 15 and 30 d of conservation. A pH value close to that of silo opening was detected in the LB, LH150, and LH300 silages conserved under MASS conditions after 100 d, whereas LB+LH was the most effective under PERIPH conditions.

Here, we aimed to clarify the influence of biochar on soil heat storage capacity and identify approaches to regulate temporal-spatial variations in Albic soil temperature. To this end, we studied thermal properties and temporal-spatial temperature variations in different soil layers (10 and 20 cm) amended with biochar at different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 g.kg(-1)) in the key growth stages of soybeans through pot experiments for two years. We found that the daily mean soil temperature and accumulated soil temperature improved during the 2 years in both soil layers after biochar application. Compared with the control, the biochar treatments increased soil daily minimum temperature, decreased soil daily maximum temperature and soil temperature fluctuations, postponed the soil heating stage by 1 h, and caused a warming effect during the soil cooling stage. Furthermore, biochar treatment enhanced the thermal capacity of the Albic soil by 7.49% and 6.53% compared with the control in 2016 and 2017, respectively, whereas thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity were decreased compared with the control. Biochar regulated the temporalspatial response variation in temperature of the Albic soil as follows: biochar distributed heat in the Albic soil more uniformly over time by changing the soil temperature cycle and reducing the temperature difference, and heat tended to move downwards into the soil layers by increasing the heat capacity and reducing soil thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. Biochar changed the heat storage capacity of the Albic soil and temporalspatial distribution of heat. These changes provide sufficient, timely, and effective heat supply for crop growth. Furthermore, biochar treatments had a significant and positive effect on soil physical properties and crop yield. In cold areas, these changes would help crops resist temperature changes caused by extreme weather and reduce the rate of cold damage. The results of this study have important practical relevance for enriching the basic scientific theory of biochar application.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-1987,1879-3444,,,,JAN,2021,205,,,,,,,,104762,10.1016/j.still.2020.104762,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2020.104762,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000582696400016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of this experiment was to determine growth rates of the endogeic earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny) over a range of temperatures (5-20 degrees C) and soil. water potentials (-5 to -54 kPa) in disturbed and undisturbed soil columns in the laboratory. We used PVC cores (6cm diameter, 15cm height) containing undisturbed and disturbed soil, and 1l cylindrical pots (11 cm diameter, 14 cm height) with disturbed soil. All containers contained about 500 g of moist soil. The growth rates of juvenile A. caliginoso were determined after 14-28 days. The instantaneous growth rate (IGR) was affected significantly by soil moisture, temperature, and the temperature x moisture interaction, ranging from -0.092 to 0.037 d(-1). Optimum growth conditions for A. coliginosa were at 20 degrees C and -5 kPa water potential, and they lost weight when the soil water potential. was -54 kPa for all temperatures and also when the temperature was 5 degrees C for all water potentials. Growth rates were significantly greater in pots than in cores, but the growth rates of earthworms in cores with undisturbed or disturbed soil did not differ significantly. The feeding and burrowing habits of earthworms should be considered when choosing the container for growth experiments in order to improve our ability to extrapolate earthworm growth rates from the laboratory to the field.

In this study standard and routine oxygen consumption rates of newly hatched and juvenile laboratory raised cuttlefish S. officinalis ranging between 0.04 and 18.48 g dry body mass (Dm), were measured over a range of temperatures (10, 15, 20 and 25A degrees C). The mass exponent (b) ranged between 0.706 and 0.992 for standard oxygen consumption and between 0.694 and 0.990 for routine oxygen consumption. Oxygen consumption scaled allometrically (b = 0.7) with body mass for cuttlefish < 2 g Dm and isometrically (b = 1) thereafter. No significant differences were apparent amongst the slopes of oxygen consumption and body mass at different temperatures for standard and routine oxygen consumption. However, the intercepts differed significantly amongst the regression lines, indicating a significant effect of temperature on the magnitude of oxygen consumption. The combined effect of temperature (T) and dry body mass (Dm) are best described by the following equations: cuttlefish < 2 g, MO2 = 0.116Dm(0.711)1.086 (T) and > 2 g, MO2 = 0.076Dm(0.983)1.091 (T) for standard oxygen consumption; cuttlefish < 2 g, MO2 = 0.538Dm(0.729)1.057 (T) and > 2 g, MO2 = 0.225Dm(0.962)1.081 (T) for routine oxygen consumption. Using these equations it was estimated that a cuttlefish of 1 g Dm held at 20A degrees C, eating 5% Dm day(-1) and undergoing standard and routine metabolism consumes 21.3 and 35.4%, respectively of its total daily energy intake. Juvenile cuttlefish (3.32-5.08 g Dm) held at 15A degrees C and deprived of food for 27 days maintained a stable standard oxygen consumption rate for the first 6 days following starvation. By the 18th day without food, oxygen consumption rate had declined by 53% and further declined to 65% below the standard oxygen consumption rate on the 27th day. Upon resumption of feeding, the respiration rate returned immediately to the initial level prior to food deprivation.

A.; Obala, Francis; Ndlela, Shepard",,,Estimating the Demographic Parameters of Tuta absoluta (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) Using Temperature-Dependent Development Models and Their Validation under Fluctuating Temperature,BIOLOGY-BASEL,,,,,,,,,,,,"Simple Summary Tuta absoluta is an invasive insect pest that has spread widely and established itself in many countries since its first detection in Spain in 2006. The devastating moth originates in South America and attacks tomato and other solanaceous vegetables, leading to huge losses in yield and potential income particularly for small-scale farmers who often lack the resources and knowledge to manage the pest. In most cases, farmers have resorted to the indiscriminate application of broad-spectrum synthetic pesticides, which in most cases are not registered and are often used at high doses. This has resulted in the pest developing resistance to most major classes of pesticides. In addition, the non-selective use of toxic pesticides has resulted in negative effects on the health of users, consumers, and non-target organisms such as pollinators and natural enemies of insect pests. Various tactics aimed at controlling T. absoluta have been developed and are at different stages of adoption by farmers. To ensure that they are effective, sustainable, and friendly to both users and the environment, there is a need for a comprehensive understanding of the pest's biology and ecology. To this effect, the present study developed models to predict intricate details of the pest's development, survival, and reproduction using data generated in laboratory studies. Among other important findings, the study reports that temperatures between 20-25 degrees C are ideal for the development, survival, reproduction, and increase in the population of T. absoluta. These findings are vital in developing strategies in managing the pest, especially in light of global climate change. The tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is an invasive pest that devastates the production of tomatoes and other solanaceous vegetables. Since its trans-Atlantic invasion in 2006, T. absoluta has spread and established in many countries across the Afro-Eurasian Supercontinent, causing huge yield losses. This study aimed to determine the relationship between temperature and the life history traits of T. absoluta and provide the thermal thresholds for development using life cycle modelling. Linear and non-linear models were fitted to life table data collected at five constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C, with Relative Humidity 70 +/- 5% and photoperiod 12L:12D. Another experiment was conducted at fluctuating temperatures to validate the laboratory results. Tuta absoluta completed its life cycle at temperatures between 15 and 35 degrees C. The development time ranged between 4.0-11 days, 6.3-16.0 days, and 5.4-20.7 days for egg, larva, and pupa, respectively. The lowest thermal threshold was estimated at 8.10, 7.83, and 11.62 degrees C, respectively for egg, larva, and pupa. While the optimum temperature for T. absoluta immature stages survival and female fecundity were predicted at a temperature range of 21-23 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), gross reproductive (GRR), and net reproductive (Ro) rates were significantly higher at temperatures between 20-25 degrees C. The model validation outcome showed similarities between observed and simulated values for development time, mortality rate, and life table parameters, attesting to the quality of the phenology model. Our results will help in predicting the effect of climate warming on the distribution and population dynamics of T. absoluta. Furthermore, the results could be used to develop management strategies adapted to different agroecological zones.",,,,,"Azrag, Abdelmutalab G. A./V-2040-2019","Azrag, Abdelmutalab G.

The reason for that would be that the most decisive factor for keeping quality is a low temperature during storage and transport. In practice, however, this low temperature is not always realised. However it is worthwhile knowing potential quality benefits that may arise from the use of modified O-2 and/or CO2 concentrations at sub-optimal temperatures. Experiments have been conducted on cut rose flowers 'First Red' to study the effect on postharvest physiology of different O-2 partial pressures (0.5-21 kPa) during 5 days at 12 degreesC. During this period of transport simulation at different O-2 partial pressures, respiration rate and ethylene production of the flowers was measured. During subsequent flower opening during vase life, diameter and longevity of the flowers were recorded. Fresh weight and area of single petals were measured daily. Growth during vase life of the inner and outer petal surfaces was estimated. Oxygen uptake rate and ethylene production were logarithmically related to O-2 partial pressure. To lower oxygen uptake rate to less than 50% of that in air, a partial pressure of O-2 should be <2 kPa. However, in the O-2 range <2 kPa the R(espiratory) Q(uotient) indicated anaerobic respiration. Vase life was not significantly affected by O-2 concentrations during a 5 day storage period. Low O-2 partial pressures during storage resulted in poor flower opening afterwards. Petal growth was not inhibited by low O-2-storage, but outer petals showed a greater increase in surface area and fresh weight after storage at 1 kPa O-2 than at higher O-2 partial pressures. Poor flower opening was the result of an increase in cell size at the upper region of the outer petal layer, which hampered outward reflex of the petals.",,,,,"van Meeteren, Uulke/AAA-9159-2019","van Meeteren, Uulke/0000-0001-8516-8512; DEVECCHI, Marco/0000-0002-5459-0398",,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,2406-6168,90-6605-478-6,,,,2003,,628,,,,,855,861,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2003.628.109,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2003.628.109,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000189407100109,View Full Record in Web of Science

The relative effects of incubation temperature and maternal/clutch effects on juvenile growth and temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) were analyzed for this population of E. marmorata. Results demonstrate that incubation temperature significantly affects hatching success and incubation duration, while both temperature and clutch have significant effects on juvenile growth.

Here we studied Trillium camschatcense, a species that is purported to have this MPD and that is sensitive to habitat fragmentation with decreased recruitment at forest edges. Methods : Trillium camschatcense seeds were collected and experiments conducted in Hokkaido, Japan over 5 years. Growth of embryos and emergence of radicles and cotyledons were tracked in relation to field temperature to determine specific temperature and light requirements for these stages under laboratory conditions. Key results: Low (winter) temperatures overcame dormancy in the underdeveloped embryos, and embryo growth and radicle emergence occurred between July and September, ca. 1 year after seed dispersal. Radicles emerged optimally over a narrow temperature range (20 -25 degrees C), in darkness, and at constant temperatures. Roots developed during the second autumn. Cotyledons needed a second low temperature (second winter) to emerge from seeds with roots, doing so in April, slightly over 1.5 years after dispersal. Conclusions: Seeds of T. camschatcense have deep simple double MPD and requirements for radicle emergence: darkness and constant temperatures. Ecologically, edges of forests may be deleterious for germination of the species due to increased light and to higher temperature fluctuations as compared to the interiors of forests. Thus, these specific requirements may play an important role in reducing seed germination of this plant at forest edges.",,,,,"Kondo, Tetsuya/A-4310-2012","Hidayati, Siti Nur/0000-0001-6979-8477",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9122,,,,,FEB,2011,98,2,,,,,215,226,,10.3732/ajb.1000151,http://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1000151,,,,,,,,21613111,,,,,WOS:000286884500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Lipson, DA; Schmidt, SK; Monson, RK",,,,"Lipson, DA; Schmidt, SK; Monson, RK",,,Carbon availability and temperature control the post-snowmelt decline in alpine soil microbial biomass,SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,,,,,,,,,,,,"In Colorado alpine dry meadow soils, microbial biomass has been observed to increase during fall and winter and to rapidly decline after snowmelt in the spring. It has been shown that these microbial population dynamics are linked to N availability to alpine plants, but the underlying mechanisms have not been explained. We hypothesized that: (1) freeze-thaw events in the spring cause reduction of the microbial biomass, (2) the winter microbial community is sensitive to prolonged temperatures above 0 degrees C, and (3) the increase of biomass in fall and its decline in spring are due to changes in C availability. We performed laboratory experiments to test the effect of temperature regime on soil microbial biomass, respiration and C availability, and made seasonal measurements of C pools. Soil microbial biomass was unaffected by freeze-thaw events in which realistic rates of freezing and thawing were used. Some significant effects were observed at faster freezing rates. Despite this tolerance to temperature fluctuations, the winter microbial community showed sensitivity to prolonged temperatures above 0 degrees C. This effect may have been caused indirectly by an effect of temperature on substrate availability. Two week incubations at increased temperatures caused a reduction in the quantity of extractable organic C in the soil. The soil concentrations of cellulose and hot water-soluble organic C were the lowest in the summer and the highest in spring and autumn, mirroring previously measured patterns of microbial biomass. This suggests that C from litter inputs could be a strong control over microbial biomass. Respiration rates in soils collected before snowmelt were high at 0 degrees C, and did not respond immediately to addition of glutamate. At 22 degrees C, or after a two week incubation at 0 degrees C, respiration in these soils became substrate-limited. Respiration rates in soils collected during the summer were very low at 0 degrees C, but responded immediately to glutamate addition at both 0 and 22 degrees C. These results show that the C balance of the soil microbial biomass undergoes a critical shift between winter and summer due to an increase in temperature and a corresponding decrease in C availability. This shift could explain the decline in microbial biomass after snowmelt. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study was intended to experimentally address the effect of straw mulch layer on soil evaporation and temperature distribution in the presence of shallow saline groundwater. A factorial-based experiment with a completely randomized design was carried out in mini-lysimeters (MLs) with different concentrations of saline groundwater and soil types, with and without straw mulch. The lysimeters were placed on the soil surface in the field. Water table in MLs was kept at the depth of 60 cm, and evaporation rate, soil moisture content, soil salinity, and temperature were continuously monitored.

The routine rates of oxygen uptake of megalopa, first and fifth instar juvenile and adult C. magister were measured, using closed vessel respirometry over 8 h during acute exposure to 100, 75 and 50% seawater at 10 and 20 degrees C. At 10 degrees C there is no significant effect of salinity on the rate of oxygen uptake of the megalopa. At 20 degrees C, however, the rate of oxygen uptake rises and is greater at 75 and 50% SW than in 100% SW The rates of oxygen uptake of the first instar juvenile, fifth instar juvenile and adult are not affected by salinity at either 10 or 20 degrees C. The oxygen uptake of the fifth instar juvenile is less temperature sensitive, at all salinities, than the other stages examined. Weight specific cardiac output is affected by both salinity and temperature. The effect of temperature on cardiac output is especially pronounced for the first instar juvenile. The first instar juvenile is the first benthic stage and therefore is an important step in recruitment of crabs in the estuary. The differences in metabolic response between the stages indicate that the first instar juvenile, in particular, may be very near the limit of its respiratory and circulatory capacities as a result of tidal changes in salinity and temperature in the intertidal estuarine habitat.

Traditional ground-referenced methods may underestimate the contribution of canopy heterogeneity to structuring the vertical profiles of forest microclimate. The present study examined how the reference height affects vertical variation of microclimate in a tropical rainforest in southwest China, based on both ground- and canopy-referenced approaches. The results show that the canopyreferenced approach yielded a higher model fit than did the ground-referenced method, and only canopy-referenced method could detect two thresholds in the leaf area index at approximately -22.6 +/- 2.7 m and -36.6 +/- 6.6 m below the canopy top; the higher threshold is consistent with thresholds of the annual mean temperature, the diurnal ranges of air temperature, and the relative humidity in the vertical profile; while the lower threshold is similar with the breakpoints of annual mean relative humidity, the annual ranges of air temperature and the relative humidity along the profile. The discontinuous variance in the microclimatic factors was due to the canopy structure in the vertical profile. Selecting the top of the canopy as the reference height could be a better approach for quantifying the microclimatic profiles in the studied forest, and this approach can improve our understanding of the effects of the vertical stratification of microclimates on species composition and diversity in this forest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1971-7458,,,,,JAN,2022,15,,,,,,24,32,,10.3832/ifor3780-014,http://dx.doi.org/10.3832/ifor3780-014,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000748372100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Alternating temperatures,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE,,,,,,,,,,,,"The germination response of 8 promising and commonly used tropical and subtropical legumes in northern Australia was tested at a range of alternating temperatures. Except at temperatures <20 degrees C or >36degreesC, total germination was largely unaffected by different alternating temperatures. Although there were statistically significant differences between constant and alternating temperatures, overall, these differences were <2% and hence of no biological importance. Increasing amplitude of fluctuation in temperature decreased the rate of germination for some species. At 8 degrees C amplitude Glycine latifolia, Macroptilium atropurpureum and Lablab purpureus showed no difference in the time taken to reach 50% of germination while Chamaecrista rotundifolia, Stylosanthes scabra and Desmanthus virgatus took 1.5-2 times as long as at constant temperature. Predicted germination against real time, using 2 different models, fitted the observed data poorly. In particular, prediction of the commencement of germination was poor for C. rotundifolia and S. scabra. This failure at more extreme or highly fluctuating temperatures indicates that further development is required before the models would be sufficiently reliable for inclusion in simulation models of legume persistence. In particular, the rate of death of seeds at temperatures distant from the optimum range needs to be included. The ability to germinate at a broad range of temperatures indicates that the species are well adapted to northern Australia. Some species may be susceptible to large fluctuations in temperature during germination, and this should be considered in criteria for selecting future species.",,,,,"MCDONALD, CAMPBELL/D-6013-2011; McDonald, Cam/AAE-5085-2019","McDonald, Cam/0000-0003-2265-2299",,,,,,,,,,,,,0816-1089,1836-5787,,,,,2002,42,4,,,,,421,429,UNSP 0816-1089/02/040421,10.1071/EA00189,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA00189,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000176670400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The seed collections used for the temperature and light studies had physical dormancy (water-impermeable), with 10-23% and 17-46% germination, respectively, of the freshly matured viable seeds. Freshly matured seeds used for the temperature study germinated to higher percentages at 15-25 degrees C constant. During winter (3 months after seed maturation), seed germination was higher at 30 degrees C constant or 22.5/37.5 degrees C fluctuating. During spring (6 months after seed maturation), there was a widening of thermal range (10-40 degrees C constant or 2.5/17.5 to 27.5/42.5 degrees C fluctuating) for germination. Germination of surface-lying or buried seeds was higher at 35-40 degrees C constant or 22.5/37.5-27.5/42.5 degrees C fluctuating in late summer (9 months after maturation) and autumn (12 months after maturation).

However, little is known about the regulation of leaf phenology in tropical trees. Methods To understand the regulation by temperature of leaf phenology in tropical trees, we performed daily observations of leaf production under rainfall-independent conditions using saplings of Shorea leprosula and Neobalanocarpus heimii, both species of Dipterocarpaceae, a dominant tree family of Southeast Asia. We analyzed the time-series data obtained using empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and conducted growth chamber experiments. Results Leaf production by dipterocarps fluctuated in the absence of fluctuation in rainfall, and the peaks of leaf production were more frequent than those of day length, suggesting that leaf production cannot be fully explained by these environmental factors, although they have been proposed as regulators of leaf phenology in dipterocarps. Instead, EDM suggested a causal relationship between temperature and leaf production in dipterocarps. Leaf production by N. heimii saplings in chambers significantly increased when temperature was increased after long-term low-temperature treatment. This increase in leaf production was observed even when only nighttime temperature was elevated, suggesting that the effect of temperature on development is not mediated by photosynthesis. Conclusions Because seasonal variation in temperature in the tropics is small, effects on leaf phenology have been overlooked. However, our results suggest that temperature is a regulator of leaf phenology in dipterocarps.

To determine the effect of the investigated factors and their interaction on culture concentration, pigment content, and photosynthetic parameters of cyanobacterium, factorial experiments and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were carried out. Both chlorophyll (Chl) a and phycobilins (PB) were influenced by the irradiance and temperature, but stronger effect was noted in the case of the former one. Chl a and PB concentration per 100 mu m of filament dropped above 4-fold with the increasing irradiance. The ratios between individual carotenoids [beta-carotene, zeaxanthin, and myxoxanthophyll (Myx)] and Chl a increased significantly with an increase in the irradiance. The greatest fluctuations were observed in the ratio of Myx to Chl a (above 10-fold). Thus, Myx was suggested as the main photoprotective carotenoid in G. amphibium. Based on photosynthetic light response (PI) curves, two mechanisms of photoacclimation in G. amphibium were recognized: a change of photosynthetic units (PSU) number and a change of PSU size. These two mechanisms constituted the base of significant changes in photosynthetic rate and its parameters, such as the compensation point (P (C)), the initial slope of photosynthetic curve (alpha), saturation irradiance (E (K)), maximal photosynthetic rate (P (max)), and dark respiration rate (R (D)). The greatest changes were observed in P (C) values (about 15-fold within the range of the factors tested).

The revised HTESSEL significantly improved the representation of soil temperature in permafrost regions compared to ERA5-Land.

Near Puerto Penasco, Sonora, sea surface temperature and algal abundance fluctuate throughout the year. To investigate how these factors influence isopod growth, we plotted the body lengths of field-collected isopods against monthly sea surface temperatures, as well as against the relative abundance of coralline algae (Corallina; Amphiroa), over a 26-month period (1983-1985). We found that average body lengths of the four adult morphs in this species (alpha-, beta-, gamma-males and females), were larger in cool months and smaller in warm months. Our records of female reproductive condition at capture allowed identification of the approximate dates on which females matured, thus the effect of temperature on growth was most clearly seen in females. Monthly average body lengths correlated negatively with temperature for all adult morphotypes, with different slopes and intercepts; morphotypes undergoing more molts had steeper slopes. Coralline algae abundance showed no seasonal patterns, and we found no significant relationships between relative algal abundance and isopod body length for any adult morph. In the laboratory, animals reared at lower temperature (21 degrees C) matured at larger body lengths than individuals reared at higher temperatures (27-30 degrees C). However, well-fed individuals grew no more rapidly than poorly-fed individuals. Thus, variation in food availability had no recognizable effect on isopod growth in either the laboratory or in the field, whereas variation in temperature significantly influenced growth in both locations, with effects proportional to the number of pre-adult molts.

The surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has a nonlinear response to warming. Cold and warm anomalies of equal size do not cancel out and it is therefore important to consider the effect of interannual fluctuations in temperature. We find that the steady-state volume of an ice sheet is biased toward larger size if interannual temperature fluctuations are not taken into account in numerical modeling of the ice sheet. We illustrate this in a simple ice sheet model and find that the equilibrium ice volume is approximately 1 m SLE (meters sea level equivalent) smaller when the simple model is forced with fluctuating temperatures as opposed to a stable climate. It is therefore important to consider the effect of interannual temperature fluctuations when designing long experiments such as paleo-spin-ups. We show how the magnitude of the potential bias can be quantified statistically. For recent simulations of the Greenland Ice Sheet, we estimate the bias to be 30 Gtyr(-1) (24-59 Gt yr(-1), 95% credibility) for a warming of 3 degrees C above preindustrial values, or 13% (10-25, 95% credibility) of the present-day rate of ice loss. Models of the Greenland Ice Sheet show a collapse threshold beyond which the ice sheet becomes unsustainable. The proximity of the threshold will be underestimated if temperature fluctuations are not taken into account. We estimate the bias to be 0.12 degrees C (0.10-0.18 degrees C, 95% credibility) for a recent estimate of the threshold.

In addition, seasonal fluctuations in temperatures significantly influence the taxonomic composition of benthic diatom communities in intertidal flats. In order to determine the physiological responses of marine benthic diatoms to temperature changes, five common species (Achnanthes brevipes C.A. Agardh, Amphora arenaria Donkin,Cocconeis peltoides Hustedt, Navicula digitoradiata (Gregory) Ralfs and N. gregaria Donkin), isolated from the Solthorn tidal flats, were chosen to study the effect of different temperatures (4, 18 and 35 degrees C) on the composition of intercellular free amino and fatty acids as well as the accumulation of polyols, saccharides and quaternary ammonium compounds (QUARCs) during short- (24h) and long-term (30d) exposures. Although the growth response of the five diatom taxa was hardly affected by temperatures in short-term temperature treatments, the growth rates were significantly lower after long-term treatments maintained at 4 and 35 degrees C. Significant differences were found in physiological responses to temperature treatments of the species tested. In experimental temperature treatments, species accumulated proline, glycerol and glucose, whereas the species in high-temperature treatments also accumulated short-chain fatty acids. By contrast, the responses to low-temperature treatments comprised accumulation of the QUARCs homarine and glycine-betaine as well as -dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In conclusion, these results showed common resistance mechanisms to temperature stresses in marine benthic diatoms, with species-specific differences in compound composition (e.g., proline). The significant differences in osmolyte compositions of the five diatom taxa during high- and low-temperature exposure suggest a species-specific physiological acclimation that may explain their growth-insensitivity towards short-term temperature variations.",,,,,"Liebezeit, Gerd/AAD-5112-2022; Scholz, Bettina/M-5882-2015","Scholz, Bettina/0000-0002-1523-5270; Scholz, Bettina/0000-0003-3440-249X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-249X,2159-8347,,,,DEC 1,2013,28,4,,,,,337,358,,10.1080/0269249X.2013.802997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0269249X.2013.802997,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000326562100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), short-term, individual developmental responses to the incubation environment have long-term consequences for populations. We took a model-based approach to study within- and among-population variation in the physiological components of TSD in 12 populations of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We used laboratory and field incubation data to quantify variation in thermal reaction norms at both population and clutch scales, focusing on the pivotal temperature that produces a 1:1 sex ratio (P) and the transitional range of incubation temperatures (TRTs) that produce mixed sex ratios. Defying theoretical expectations, among-population variation in P was not convincingly explained by geography or local thermal conditions. However, within some populations, P varied by >5 degrees C at the clutch scale, indicating that the temperature sensitivity of gonadal differentiation can vary substantially among individual nesting females. In addition, the TRT was wider at lower latitudes, suggesting responsiveness to local incubation conditions. Our results provide a potential explanation for discrepancies observed between constant-temperature experimental results and outcomes of fluctuating incubation conditions experienced in natural nests, exposing important knowledge gaps in our understanding of local adaptation in TSD and identifying shortcomings of traditional laboratory studies. Understanding individual variation and the timing of gonadal differentiation is likely to be far more useful in understanding local adaptation than previously acknowledged.

Tolerance to elevated temperatures has been particularly well-studied for a variety of intertidal species, especially with regard to upper thermal limits during summers. However, in recent years, as climates have been changing around the world, temperate zone intertidal organisms have sometimes been exposed to periods of unusually high air temperatures during the winter. The present study sought to examine the impact of elevated temperatures on survival and clearance rates of winter-acclimated intertidal individuals of the sedentary marine suspension-feeding gastropod Crepidula fornicata. Individuals were collected intertidally from Nahant, Massachusetts from late January to early April each year for 5 years, maintained in the laboratory at the acclimation temperature of 6 degrees C, and exposed in the laboratory for 3 h to temperatures as high as 37 degrees C in seawater either once or twice, 24 h apart. Although mean clearance rates were substantially reduced for at least the next 12-24 h after individuals were returned to the 6 degrees C control condition following exposures to elevated temperatures as low as 21-26 degrees C, we saw little mortality even following two 3 h exposures to 35 degrees C, or single exposures to 37 degrees C. Mortality was substantial, however, in one experiment following a double exposure to 37 degrees C. Smaller individuals (similar to 5-12 mm in shell length) were somewhat more sensitive to the thermal stress than adults were. Intertidal members of C. fornicata in Massachusetts seem well-prepared to deal with the increasing range of winter air temperatures associated with the global climate confusion predicted for future years.

Short-term tolerance of low temperature and low salinity by three species of wrasse, goldsinny Ctenolabrus rupestris rock cook Centrolabrus exoletus corkwing Crenilabrus melops caught during the summer, and winter-caught corkwing, was investigated. A 3-day period at 30 or 32 parts per thousand salinity and temperature 8, 6 or 4 degrees C (for summer-caught fish; 4 degrees C only for winter-caught) was followed by a decline in salinity to 24, 16 or 8 parts per thousand over c. 36 h, followed by a further 24 h at these salinities held constant, at each of the three temperatures. Controls in 30 or 32 parts per thousand were maintained at 8, 6 or 4 degrees C. Mortality of summer-caught corkwing and rock cook was high at 4 degrees C, whereas the influence of salinity on mortality was small. Mortality of goldsinny was low or zero in all treatments. Surviving corkwing and rock cook after 3 days at 4 degrees C and 32 parts per thousand salinity had elevated plasma osmolality: in summer-caught corkwing, plasma [Cl-] and [Na+] were high, whereas in rock cook only [Na+] was high. Haematocrit was low in summer-caught corkwing, high in rock cook. In survivors of all three species at the end of the experiment, values of all these parameters were comparable with those of fish at the beginning of the experiment, except that survivors at low salinity (8, 16 parts per thousand) had low plasma osmolality, at all temperatures, and in surviving rock cook in these treatments haematocrit was high and plasma [Cl-] was low. Winter-caught corkwing had higher osmolality, [Na+] and [Cl-] than summer-caught corkwing; there was no difference in haematocrit. Survival of winter-caught corkwing exposed to four salinities at 4 degrees C was much higher than that of summer-caught corkwing under the same conditions. Little change in blood physiology was recorded for winter-caught corkwing, with only fish subjected to 8 parts per thousand and 4 degrees C showing signs of osmoregulatory stress.

Overall, it can be seen that the SR continue to increase with the precipitation increasing and the temperature rising. SR has no significant correlation with above-ground living biomass (ALB), but is significantly correlated with root biomass (RB), so SR mainly comes from the root system, and ALB and RB both increase with rainfall rising.

The mean daily temperatures fluctuated from 18 (growing month-April) to 29 degrees C (August), while the mean sunlight intensities varied from 850 (October) to 1257 mu mol m(-2) S-1 (August). The highest biomass yield and betacyanin accumulation was obtained in the warmer growing period (July and August) at 28 to 29 degrees C mean air temperatures and 1240 to 1257 mu mol m(-2) S-1 sunlight intensity. At the warmer growing period red amaranth produced red leaves with high color index, which enhanced the betacyanin accumulations. The biomass yield and betacyanin accumulations were reduced significantly in the growing period/month April and October under low temperature regimes (mean air temperature 18 and 19 degrees C, respectively). However, growing period's air temperature contributed more for biomass and betacyanin accumulations in red amaranth than sunlight intensity. Comparing two cultivars the biomass yield of BARI-1 was higher biomass yield than that of Altopati and Altopati highlighted with the higher betacyanin accumulations than that of BARI-1 in all growing period. Quantification of the effects of daily air temperature and sunlight intensity on biomass and betacyanin accumulation is important for growers producing these crops for fresh market and also optimize the best growing period.

These factors also strongly influence grassland ecosystems. This study interpreted long-term (2009-2019) ground observation data on soil temperature, soil moisture, and meteorological factors from a study area in Inner Mongolia. The monitoring station collected soil moisture, soil temperature, and precipitation data. Covarying relationships indicated how soil properties influence each other throughout the year. Soil temperature was clearly affected by atmospheric changes, solar radiation, and freeze/thaw processes. The surface soil layers showed the greatest degree of variation, while middle and lower layers showed less seasonal variation and smaller differences between daily highs and lows. Surface soil moisture correlates strongly with the vertical temperature decline in soil. Time series revealed major variation in soil moisture throughout the year with lower soil layers showing obvious hysteresis effects. Multi-year soil moisture data allowed for subdivision of the year into seven intervals based maximum and minimum values. Soil temperature showed unique patterns of covariation with soil moisture during different time periods. Differences in soil moisture cause more rapid changes in temperature during soil thawing relative the moisture-induced temperature changes observed 1 month after soil freezing. When soil temperature was greater than 0 degrees C (32 ?), soil temperature and soil moisture showed inverse correlation. A dependency of evapotranspiration on soil temperature can explain its effect on soil moisture. When soil temperature fell below 0 degrees C(32 ?), soil temperature and soil moisture showed a positive correlation. During an interval defined as the summer fluctuation (SF), precipitation and soil moisture showed a significant positive correlation.

And their hygrothermal performance is mainly dependent on the moisture properties, such as sorption isotherm and water vapor permeability etc. Instead of a univalued function of relative humidity, sorption isotherm of wood materials is not only affected by sorption history, but also temperature dependent. This work is devoted to a better understanding of the effects of temperature dependent sorption hysteresis on moisture transport in wood and wood based materials under ambient temperature and relative humidity variations through experimental investigations and numerical modeling. In part I, the formulated hygrothermal model based on local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption and Frandsen's hysteresis model are experimentally validated. In this part, the effects of sorption hysteresis and its temperature dependency are investigated under several dynamic conditions through numerical modeling. Hysteresis should be taken into account in determining the moisture buffering capacity, and temperature dependency should be considered to investigate the RH variation in the material when it is subjected to drastic temperature fluctuation. Then heat and moisture transport through a roof assembly under natural climate conditions is further modelled to show the effects of temperature dependent sorption hysteresis in practical applications.

While growth decline under lower water temperatures are reasonably well understood, the mechanisms behind production decline under high water temperatures are yet to be well elucidated and have been hampered by a lack of data describing pre- and postprandial patterns of endocrine fluctuation. The present research therefore aims to determine whether peak nutrient flux into the blood plasma is the most appropriate time point to investigate the endocrine regulation of growth and appetite under conditions of normal and high temperature, and to investigate the interrelationship between appetite and growth on a pre- and post-prandial time scale. Two experiments are presented which examine ghrelin (GHRL) as an indicator of appetite stimulation, the GH-IGF (growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor) system to describe growth-regulating processes and free amino acids (FAA) to indicate postprandial nutrient influx and link appetite and anabolic processes. Postprandial sampling of plasma and white muscle tissue from short-term adapted postsmolt was conducted at 13 degrees C and 19 degrees C at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours (h). The same samples were taken from long-term adapted big salmon at 12 degrees C, -4, -2, -1, 0 h pre-prandially and 2, 3, 4 and 6 h post-prandially. While limited relationship between plasma ghrelin concentration and meal times was found for short term adapted postsmolt, clear ghrelin peaks were described for long term adapted salmon prior to the timing of anticipated meals. Possible explanations and consequences to experimental design in this area will be discussed. Postprandial FAA in plasma and white muscle from postsmolt was reduced at 19 degrees C compared to 13 degrees C and plasma levels peaked 8 h post-prandially. Muscle Igf1 mRNA expression levels were consistently higher at 13 degrees C than 19 degrees C, with no clear postprandial patters. In contrast, plasma IGF-1 concentration was relatively constant over time at 12 degrees C and 13 degrees C, but significantly declined from 20 h postprandially at 19 degrees C. GH receptor (ghr1) mRNA expression in muscle was unaffected by temperature, peaking 4 h post-prandially at both temperatures.

We examined the influence of diel fluctuations in developmental temperatures on the thermal sensitivity of the maximal swimming capacity in larvae of the alpine newt, Triturus alpestris. We incubated newt eggs under three thermal regimes with varying daily amplitudes (1, 5 and 9 degrees C) and similar means (17 center dot 6-17 center dot 9 degrees C), and accordingly we measured the swimming speed of hatched larvae at three experimental temperatures (12, 17 and 22 degrees C), which they would normally experience in their natural habitat. Embryonic development under low and middle temperature fluctuations produced larvae with similar swimming speeds across experimental temperatures. In contrast, the most fluctuating regime induced development of phenotypes, which at 12 degrees C swam faster than larvae developed under moderate diel fluctuations. Our results provide evidence that diel temperature fluctuations induce acclimation of thermal dependence of locomotor performance.

Being a typical brackish water species with very broad habitat preferences and environmental limits, adults are extremely tolerant to fluctuations in temperature and salinity. The life cycle of mussels however, consists of two phases: (1) from fertilization until larval settlement they are pelagic, only protected by a larval soft shell and (2) after settlement, the individuals become benthic and develop a hard mytiliform shell. The fact that adult mussels can close their protective valves is the major reason why they are important fouling species and are difficult to remove once settled. Therefore, vulnerability of different larval life stages of M. leucophaeata to temperature and salinity was investigated during standardized acute 48 h experimental tests. In addition, the survival limits of the most vulnerable larval life stage were determined at different temperature-salinity combinations. Results indicated that larval stages show a differential vulnerability: 4 h old embryos were more vulnerable to changes in temperature and salinity than 2 day old larvae. Maximal survival of 4 h old embryos was found at 22 degrees C at salinity 15. Surrounding this optimum, conditions stayed good for survival in a rather wide range: only salinities of 0 and 25 and temperatures below 10 degrees C or above 30 degrees C caused high embryonic mortality. Thus, even the most vulnerable larval stage in the life cycle of M. leucophaeata can be considered highly resistant to environmental conditions. Considering the broad environmental limits of adult as well as larval M. leucophaeata, we can expect this species to appear many brackish water bodies worldwide, with only colder regions potentially limiting its invasion success.

While field observations on organismic responses to heatwaves are emerging, experimental evidence is rare and almost lacking for shorter-scale environmental variability. For two major invertebrate predators, we simulated sinusoidal temperature variability (+/- 3 degrees C) around todays' warm summer temperatures and around a future warming scenario (+4 degrees C) over two months, based on high-resolution 15-year temperature data that allowed implementation of realistic seasonal temperature shifts peaking midpoint. Warming decreased sea stars' (Asterias rubens) energy uptake (Mytilus edulis consumption) and overall growth. Variability around the warming scenario imposed additional stress onto Asterias leading to an earlier collapse in feeding under sinusoidal fluctuations. High-peak temperatures prevented feeding, which was not compensated during phases of stress release (low-temperature peaks).

Different types of fillets were used for the experiment, fresh deepwater redfish (Sebastes mentella) fillets (105 g) and two sizes of saithe (Pollachius virens) fillets (289 g and 634 g). The fillet temperature increased with time, and more rapidly at higher ambient temperatures, particularly with smaller sized fillets. Similarly, the rate and quantity of drip formation were affected by all experimental factors. The effects decreased (p < 0.05) in the following order: holding time > type of fillets > ambient temperature. The rate of changes in both temperature and drip loss were greater during the first hour of holding but levelled off with longer holding time. Results indicated that time-temperature abuse, even during relatively short (<1 h) exposure of fillets, may lead to significant economic losses due to weight reduction of the products.

Which is more Important?,CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Plant transpiration is a key component of the terrestrial water cycle, and it is important to understand whether rates are likely to increase or decrease in the future. Plant transpiration rates are affected by biophysical factors, such as air temperature, vapour pressure deficits and net radiation, and by plant factors, such as canopy leaf area and stomatal conductance. Under future climate change, global temperature increases, and associated increases in vapour pressure deficits, will act to increase canopy transpiration rates. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, however, is likely to lead to some reduction in stomatal conductance, which will reduce canopy transpiration rates. The objective of the present paper was to quantitatively compare the importance of these opposing driving forces. First, we reviewed the existing literature and list a large range of observations of the extent of decreasing stomatal conductance with increasing CO2 concentrations. We considered observations ranging from short-term laboratory-based experiments with plants grown under different CO2 concentrations to studies of plants exposed to the naturally increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Using these empirical observations of plant responses, and a set of well-tested biophysical relationships, we then estimated the net effect of the opposing influences of warming and CO2 concentration on transpiration rates. As specific cases studies, we explored expected changes in greater detail for six specific representative locations, covering the range from tropical to boreal forests. For most locations investigated, we calculated reductions in daily transpiration rates over the twenty-first century that became stronger under higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It showed that the effect of CO2-induced reduction of stomatal conductance would have a stronger transpiration-depressing effect than the stimulatory effect of future warming. For currently cold regions, global warming would, however, lengthen the growing seasons so that annual sums of transpiration could increase in those regions despite reductions in daily transpiration rates over the summer months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2198-6436,,,,,JUN,2018,4,2,,,,,51,71,,10.1007/s40725-018-0073-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40725-018-0073-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000432549800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding the effects of incubation temperature and substrate moisture on embryos and hatchlings is of great significance for improving the artificial culture of M. reevesii. However, available studies have not yet determined the thermal and hydric optima for M. reevesii eggs, and the potential interaction between the two factors. Methods: In this study, eggs of M. reevesii were incubated at five temperature levels (23, 26, 29, 32 and 35 degrees C, fluctuation range +/- 0.5 degrees C). In each temperature level, there were three substrate moisture levels (1:0.5, 1:0.9 and 1:1.2, weight ratio of vermiculite to water). Thus, a total of 15 combinations of temperature and moisture were used to examine the effects of incubation temperature and substrate moisture on incubation duration, hatching success, hatchling phenotypes, post-hatching growth and hatchling survival. Results: Substrate moisture did not significantly affect most development parameters (except incubation duration and carapace width of hatchlings). Eggs incubated at low moisture level (1:0.5) had a longer incubation duration and produced hatchlings with smaller carapace widths than those incubated at medium (1:0.9) or high (1:1.2) moisture levels. Incubation temperature had a significant effect on incubation duration, hatching success, hatchling phenotypes and hatchling survival. Incubation duration decreased as incubation temperature increased. Eggs incubated at 23, 26 and 29 degrees C showed higher hatching success than those incubated at 32 and 35 degrees C. Hatchlings incubated at 32 degrees C were smaller in body size and mass than those incubated at 23, 26 and 29 degrees C. At 12 months of age, incubation temperature had no long-lasting effect on body mass, but hatchlings incubated at 23 and 35 degrees C had lower survival rates than those incubated at 26, 29 and 32 degrees C. For the development of embryos and hatchlings, the interaction between incubation temperature and substrate moisture was not significant. Conclusions: Our results indicate that incubation temperature has a significant influence on the development of embryos and hatchlings of M. reevesii, while substrate moisture only significantly affects the incubation duration and carapace width of hatchlings. The combination of an incubation temperature of 29 +/- 0.5 degrees C and a substrate moisture level of 1:1.2 represented optimal incubation conditions in this experiment. Such incubation conditions are helpful in obtaining higher hatching success, shorter incubation duration and higher survival rates for this aquaculture species.",,,,,,"Cao, Dainan/0000-0001-6119-9357",,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,FEB 12,2021,9,,,,,,,,e10553,10.7717/peerj.10553,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10553,,,,,,,,33614259,,,,,WOS:000617785300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, variations in the gross and net N transformation rates between two Chinese paddy soils, namely, hydragric anthrosol (HA) and anthraquic cambisol (AC) in response to temperature (5, 15, 25, and 35 A degrees C) were investigated by conducting an aerobic N-15 dilution incubation experiment. The short-term (11 days) dynamics of gross N transformation rates was estimated using the numerical model FLUAZ. The results showed that increasing incubation temperature caused an increased gross and net transformation in the tested soils. However, the sensitivity to temperature fluctuation varied among the N transformation processes. Nitrogen mineralization was less sensitive than immobilization and nitrification at low temperatures (< 15 A degrees C). The optimum temperature for gross N nitrification in the studied paddy soils was approximately 25 A degrees C. Higher gross N mineralization and gross N nitrification were observed in soil AC than in soil HA and were attributed to its higher pH (pH = 8.3), but further confirmation is needed. The ammonium (NH4 (+)) in studied paddy soils was mostly consumed through the nitrification process compared with that in the immobilization process, especially in alkaline soil AC.

Permafrost observatories with borcholes were established along a north-south transect of Alaska in undisturbed permafrost terrain. The analysis and interpretation of annual temperature measurements in the boreholes and daily temperature measurements of the air, ground and permafrost surfaces made with automated temperature loggers are reported. Permafrost temperatures warmed along this transect coincident with a statewide warming of air temperatures that began in 1977. At two sites oil the Arctic Coastal Plain, the warming was seasonal, greatest during winter months (October through May) and least during summer, months (June through September). Permafrost temperatures peaked in the early 1980s and then decreased in response to slightly cooler air temperatures and thinner snow covers. Arctic sites began warming again typically about 1986 and Interior Alaska sites about 1988. Gulkana, the southernmost site, has been warming slowly since it was drilled in 1983. Air temperatures were relatively warm and snow covers were thicker-than-normal from the late 1980s into the late 1990s allowing permaftost temperatures to continue to warm. Temperatures at some sites leveled off or cooled slightly at the turn of the century. Two sites (Yukon River Bridge and Livengood) cooled during the period of observations. The magnitude of the total warming at the surface of the permafrost (through 2003) was 3 to 4 degrees C for the Arctic Coastal Plain, I to 2 degrees C for the Brooks Range including its northern and southern foothills, and 0.3 to 1 degrees C south of the Yukon River. While the data are sparse, permafrost is wanning throughout the region north of the Brooks Range, southward along the transect from the Brooks Range to the Chugach Mountains (except for Yukon River and Livengood), in Interior Alaska throughout the Tanana River region, and in the region south of the Alaska Range from Tok westward to Gulkana (in the Copper Rivet- Valley) and beyond to the Talkeetna Mountains. Thermal offset allows permafrost to survive in the presence of positive annual mean ground Surface temperatures and was observed repeatedly since 1987 at two sites. The observed warming has not produced ail increasing trend in maximum active layer thicknesses due to its seasonality. Near Healy, permafrost has been thawing at the top since the late 1980s at about 10 cm/yr.

Empirical models of food consumption may be used to estimate energetic benefits based on abiotic and biotic conditions in patches of habitat. We performed thirty daily surveys of fish stomach contents to estimate the consumption rates for juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) in a river. The data were used to assess whether variations of daily consumption rates existed within the river, and to develop empirical models that could predict fish consumption rates using abiotic and biotic conditions as independent variables. Daily consumption rates based on stomach content surveys in the field (range: 0.15-1.49 g dry/(100 g wet day)) varied significantly depending on habitat patch (500-1000 m(2)), summer period, and sampling year. Variables such as water temperature, numerical density of salmon, water depth and moon phase explained 83-93% of the variations in daily food consumption rates. Daily consumption rates tended to increase with water temperature and depth, and were also higher near a full moon. However, they tended to decrease with the numerical density of salmon. Our work suggests that empirical models based on independent variables that are relatively simple to estimate in the field may be developed to predict fish consumption rates in different habitat patches in a river.

Soil temperatures at depths of 0, 5, 10 and 20 cm were highest in flail mowed treatment plots (up to near 45 degrees C at 5 cm depth), followed by sickle bar mowed plots (averaging 10 degrees C lower at 5 cm depth). Lowest soil temperatures were maintained in plots that were not mowed; averaging 5 degrees C lower at 5 cm depth than the sickle bar mowed plots. Increasing temperature convergence was observed below 5 cm, with the highest Microbial biomass temperature (flail mowed treatment) at 32 degrees C and the lowest (not mowed) at 27 degrees C increased significantly (P<0.05) from <100 mg C kg(-1) soil in the late spring, to >150 mg C kg(-1) in the early fall. beta-glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase activities decreased slowly throughout the experiment, and were significantly greater (P<0.05) only when comparing the not mowed treatment to both mowing treatments. Dissolved organic C (DOC) decreased sharply, perhaps due to rainfall. Similarly, soil inorganic N decreased sharply, from approximately 0.025 mg N kg(-1) soil in the not mowed plots, to approximately 0.005 mg N kg(-1) during a rainy period. Immobilization of N during rapid microbial biomass growth could also explain the decrease in inorganic N. While resin-extractable P was significantly higher in the not mowed treatment, few differences in extractable P were detected between either mowing treatment during the experiment. Standing oat residues maintained higher levels of soil enzyme activities and the lowest microbial biomass, suggesting that controlling contact of crop residues with the soil may introduce a rate limiting factor for residue decomposition. The timing of residue decomposition in this system may be delayed by leaving most of the plant biomass above the ground (i.e. not mowed or sickle bar mowed). These residue management factors may be important in controlling soil nutrient transformations and soil organic matter maintenance in subtropical climates.

Analysis of the simultaneous effects of temperature and alleochemicals is also necessary because these factors may interact. We examined the effects of three allelochemicals found in tomato (chlorogenic acid, rutin and tomatine) and thermal regime (21:10 degrees C and 26:15 degrees C, representing spring and summer respectively) on five insect herbivores (a Solanaceae specialist, Manduca sex-tn, and the polyphagous Heliothis virescens, Pseudoplusia includens, Spodoptera frugiperda and Trichoplusia iii). There were allelochemical interactions and thermal regime-allelochemical interactions for all species, and so the patterns were complex. In some cases, paired allelochemicals or the combination of three allelochemicals showed adverse additive effects on insect performance. But that was not always the case, and there were only a few examples of synergism. Negative effects of the allelochemicals were sometimes, but not always, damped by the cooler thermal regime. Comparing the growth rates of the five species in this study with those of a previous study (a total of seven species) revealed five patterns. For two of three pairs of closely-related species, the paired species had distinctly different patterns. For example, for H. virescens, tomatine prevented development and chlorogenic acid slowed growth, whereas for Helicoverpa tea, tomatine just slowed growth and the phenolics had little effect. The specialist Manduca sexta had a pattern that was midway between patterns of the generalists; it was not the most tolerant of the allelochemicals.",,,,,"Stamp, Nancy E/C-3806-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,,,,,JUL,1998,88,1,,,,,81,96,,10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00349.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00349.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000075583400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the basis of these suggestions, the present study was undertaken to compare fluctuations in RT, ST and Ht between buffaloes and tropical cattle. Fluctuations in the aforementioned parameters, particularly RT and Ht, were greater in butraloes than in cattle. Moreover, the correlation for RT or Ht v.

In a semiarid ecosystem on the Chinese Loess Plateau, the thermal properties of moss-dominated biocrust layer and bare soil (upper 2 cm) were measured, and their correlations with the biocrust characteristics as well as soil properties (especially soil water content, theta) were analyzed. Afterwards, the soil temperature dynamics of the biocrust covered soil and bare soil were continuously recorded at 2, 6, and 10 cm depths during a year. From in-situ measurements in wet season, we found that the biocrusts increased surface soil heat capacity (C) by 10.3% (1.42 vs. 1.28 MJ m(-3) K-1), thermal conductivity (lambda) by 27.7% (0.69 vs. 0.54 W m(-1) K-1), and thermal diffusivity (alpha) by 27.9% (5.01 vs. 3.92 x 10(-7) m(2) s(-1)) as compared with the bare soil, through holding more soil water (theta of the biocrusts vs. bare soil = 0.06 vs. 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3)). However, in dry season (theta < 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3)) they decreased 33.4% of surface soil C (0.78 vs. 1.17 MJ m(-3) K-1), 54.9% of lambda (0.17 vs. 0.37 W m(-1) K-1), and 22.9% of a (2.32 vs. 3.01 x 10(-7) m(2) s(-1)) mostly by decreasing surface soil bulk density. Accordingly, the biocrusts decreased soil temperature by as much as 6.3-11.1 degrees C at 0-10 cm depth in wet season (summer), and they increased soil temperature by up to 1.3-3.7 degrees C in dry season (winter). More importantly, the diurnal range of soil temperature of the biocrust covered soil was sometimes as much as 6.8-9.4 degrees C lower than that of the bare soil at 0-10 cm depth. The decreasing or increasing effects of the biocrusts on soil temperature were exactly explained by the increased thermal properties of the biocrust layer in wet season or reduced thermal properties of the biocrust layer in dry season. We concluded that the biocrusts regulated surface soil thermal properties through increasing soil water holding capacity and decreasing soil bulk density; thus, they generated considerable buffering effects on soil temperature dynamics. In dryland ecosystem, such buffering effects of the biocrusts on soil temperature should be highly considered in various soil biological and biochemical processes.",,,,,"Xiao, Bo/F-9722-2013","Xiao, Bo/0000-0002-9544-4207",,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-7061,1872-6259,,,,OCT 1,2019,351,,,,,,9,24,,10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.05.017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.05.017,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000474495700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

During spring or autumn it is difficult to obtain short compact plants by a negative DIF with regular temperature integration. In this research, temperature integration was therefore modified by applying two independent integration regimes, one for daytime and one for nighttime while a zero DIF was set.

Zooplankton often uses them as a refuge, but in the absence of predators many species frequently avoid them. It is hypothesized that plant exudates can act as repellent factors because they can be detrimental to the animals' life history. This work aimed to test both assumptions: whether exudates of two free-floating species, Eichhornia crassipes and Salvinia biloba, repel the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia and whether they affect its life history. Furthermore, given the possibility that increasing temperatures can modify the observed responses, the experimental research was carried out at two temperature levels: 21 and 25 (+/- 1) A degrees C. First, an avoidance experiment was performed inside narrow aquaria containing the plants, so that repellence was analyzed according to the location of animals after 30, 60 and 90 min. Second, for the life cycle experiments, cladocerans were raised in macrophyte-conditioned water and their lifespan, growth and reproduction were daily monitored. Macrophytes' exudates effectively repelled C. dubia and affected its life history by decreasing its life expectancy, increasing the age at first reproduction and lowering the number of eggs per female. The magnitude of such effects depended on the treatment, i.e. both plants together caused more negative effects than E. crassipes alone, and this latter was more negative than S. biloba. At higher temperature, the negative effects were intensified but C. dubia maintained the same order of sensitivity to each treatment. This suggests that temperature variations, within a tolerance range, do not alter the allelopathic interactions between the studied species.",,,,,,"Gutierrez, Maria Florencia/0000-0003-2644-3339",,,,,,,,,,,,,1439-8621,1439-863X,,,,JAN,2014,15,1,,,,,37,45,,10.1007/s10201-013-0411-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-013-0411-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000329834800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Germination rate, which is a reciprocal of the duration for 50% germination of seeds, was linearly regressed against temperature to calculate the base temperature and thermal constant of seed germination. The calculated values were 3 center dot 9 degrees C and 15 center dot 8 degree days for red clover, 4 center dot 2 degrees C and 13 center dot 6 degree days for white clover, and 2 center dot 9 degrees C and 17 center dot 7 degree days for lucerne. Using the base temperatures, thermal constants, and the daily mean air temperatures at the study site, the seedling emergence dates of the three forage legumes were predicted. At the same time, in an outdoor pot experiment, seeds of these legumes were sown approximately every 3 weeks and seedling emergence dates were determined. The predicted dates of seedling emergence generally fitted the observed dates. Another prediction was attempted using the base temperatures, thermal constants, and normal daily mean air temperatures recorded over more than 30 years in the study site. This prediction showed that the seedlings of the three forage legumes began to emerge at the beginning of April and could continue to emerge until the beginning of November when their non-dormant seeds were present in the site, and that when the seeds were sown from mid-November of one year to late March of the next year, the emergence of seedlings was delayed until the beginning of April.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0142-5242,,,,,JUN,2010,65,2,,,,,212,219,,10.1111/j.1365-2494.2010.00739.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2010.00739.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000277380700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

One linear and seven nonlinear regression functions were fit to egg-to-adult development rate data to characterize thermal performance curves. Temperature fluctuations significantly affected both development and longevity of T. radiata. Estimates of degree-days predicted by the linear model were 30% higher for the fluctuating regime than the constant regime. Nonlinear model estimations of theoretical minimum and maximum developmental thresholds were lower for the fluctuating regime when compared to the constant regime. These predictions align with experimental observations. Parasitoids reared under fluctuating profiles at low average temperatures developed faster (15 degrees C) and survived longer (15-20 degrees C) when compared to those reared under constant regimes with corresponding means. In contrast, high average fluctuating temperatures produced parasitoids with an extended developmental period (35 degrees C) and reduced longevity (30-35 degrees C). A meta-analysis of published T. radiata development datasets, together with the results of this study, indicated convergence in degree-days and theoretical minimum developmental thresholds among geographically distinct parasitoid populations.

At normal temperature (16 degrees C), both gill and liver phospholipids of Atlantic salmon had lower saturated fatty acid (SFA) and higher unsaturated (UFA) compositions than those of Steelhead trout. Atlantic salmon was more sensitive to the temperature decline than Steelhead trout at the early stage of the experiment. Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) contents of Atlantic salmon liver phospholipids significantly increased as temperature decreased from 16 degrees C to 12 degrees C. However, both PUFA and MUFA contents decreased significantly at temperatures below 4 degrees C. In contrast, there was only a negligible decrease in MUFA content in Steelhead trout liver phospholipids at 1 degrees C. Starvation and cold stress influenced liver phospholipid FA composition in Atlantic salmon but not in Steelhead trout, suggesting that the latter can better adapt to low temperatures. Changes in gill phospholipid composition in response to temperature fluctuations were species-specific. When the ambient temperature was below 8 degrees C, SFA content of gill phospholipids decreased whereas PUFA content increased and MUFA content was unaltered in Atlantic salmon. Although the FA composition of gill phospholipids in Atlantic salmon was altered at 6 degrees C, it remained stable as temperature further decreased. These results indicate that the FA composition of gill phospholipids in Atlantic salmon is less influenced by starvation stress than that of liver phospholipids. Moreover, fewer changes in FA composition were observed for gill as compared to liver phospholipids in both species of fish.

When extra soil nitrate and carbon contents were not supplied, observed potential denitrification ranged from 2 to 6 kg N ha(-1) day(-1) depending on soil water content. The effect of temperature was also studied with the aim of calibrating the influence of the day-night cycle on denitrification. A simple experiment was carried out indicating a N2O + N-2 emission four times greater in the case of treatment at a constant temperature than for treatment with a fluctuating temperature, but with the same average temperature. Field experiments were carried out for 2 years on two crops with different cycles: oats, grown in winter and spring with a short irrigation period, and maize, an intensively irrigated summer crop. Moreover, three N treatments were tested: two controls with different N levels and one fertilized with urea. Denitrification was periodically estimated, and soil temperature, water and nitrate content simultaneously measured. Daily denitrification rates (kg N ha(-1) day(-1)) ranged from O for all treatments to 1.2 for the urea-treated plot. Maximum emission was observed with the urea treatment (40.7 kg N ha(-1)) during the whole period of the experiment; 10% of N applied with urea fertilizer was estimated to be lost, mainly during the maize period, when high temperatures and soil N and water contents coincide. Finally, a prediction model was evaluated with acceptable results. This makes it possible to evaluate agronomic practices in relation to their effect on denitrification losses.

N.",,,Improvement of the Method for Reconstructing the Temperature and Salinity Three-Dimensional Fields of the Black Sea Based on Insufficient Measurements and Altimetry,PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The article represents the results of two special numerical experiments aimed at improving the previously proposed procedure of reconstructing salinity and temperature three-dimensional fields based on the altimetry data and the insufficient measurements performed at the stations and the Argo buoys in 2012. In the Experiment 1, the monthly average coefficients of sea level linear dependence and depths where the salinity values of the zero gradation altimetry level profile lie within the salinity profiles of positive and negative gradations are applied. The procedure for calculating the daily average coefficients of the depth linear trends is realized in the Experiment 2. It is shown that the thermohaline fields reconstructed in the Experiment 2 for the deepwater area are more accurate; on the horizons of the 100-500 m layer their values range smoothly from one day to another. The Black Sea hydrophysical fields are reconstructed by assimilation in the model of three-dimensional thermohaline parameters in the reanalysis for 2012. It is revealed that, as compared to the observations on the overwhelming majority of horizons in the 0-500 m layer (the Experiment 2), the standard root-mean-square deviations of temperature and salinity are lower than those in Experiment 1. The root of the measured salinity field dispersion exceeds the standard deviations on all the horizons within 0-500 m, inclusive. Application of the daily average coefficients of the linear trends for reconstructing three-dimensional fields of temperature and salinity, and their subsequent assimilation in the model is preferable. It is revealed that the model of the upper 0-100 m layer thermodynamics requires improvement.",,,,,"Lishaev, Pavel/A-7770-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0928-5105,1573-160X,,,,,2016,,6,,,,,3,14,,10.22449/1573-160X-2016-6-3-14,http://dx.doi.org/10.22449/1573-160X-2016-6-3-14,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000452651400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, a few studies have tested these relationships in the wild. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of nest characteristics and environment (hatch year, nest basal area and height, clutch size, distance to shore line, and vegetation cover), to incubation temperature and hatching success among Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii). The study was carried out during the nesting seasons of Morelet's crocodile, from 2007 to 2009 in the Laguna de Las Ilusiones, an urban lake located in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico. We physically characterized 18 nests and inserted a temperature data logger in each nest chamber. At the end of the nesting season and prior to hatching, we recovered the crocodile eggs and data loggers and calculated hatching success, under laboratory conditions. We related the environmental variables of the nest with the mean and fluctuation (standard deviation) of nest temperature, using linear models. We also related the environmental variables affecting the nest, to mean nest temperature and fluctuation in incubation temperature and to hatching success, using linear models. Although we found differences in incubation temperature between nests, mean incubation temperature did not differ between years, but there were differences in nest thermal fluctuation between years. The mean incubation temperature for 11 nests (61.1%) was lower than the suggested Female-Male pivotal temperature (producing 50% of each sex) for this species, and all hatchlings obtained were males. There were no differences in clutch size between years, but hatching success varied. Our study indicates that hatching success depends on certain environmental variables and nest conditions to which the eggs are subjected, including season, nest size and clutch size. We also discuss the importance of the fluctuation of incubation temperature on hatching success and sex determination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Daily temperature variation differs between microhabitats, which means that subpopulations of the same species may respond differently to temperature. The aim of this study is to determine how physiological responses to temperature of the limpet Cellana tramoserica differ between limpets from variable and from stable thermal environments. Oxygen consumption and anaerobic and aerobic metabolic capacities were measured over a range of temperatures in limpets from thermally stable and variable field sites in summer and winter, and in laboratory acclimation treatments. Limpets from both variable and stable sites, showed acclimatisation of anaerobic and aerobic potentials. Limpets from stable environments, but not from variable environments, showed increased oxygen consumption in winter. Comparison of field and laboratory data showed that temperature was the signal for acclimatisation. The physiological response of C. tramoserica to temperature depends on season and microhabitat. Care must therefore be taken when conducting interspecies comparisons of response to temperature to address the confounding effects of phenotypic plasticity. Differences in physiological response to temperature in phenotypically flexible species like C. tramoserica may simply reflect individual reactions to immediate environmental conditions.

While we know a great deal about how different constant temperatures impact the phenotypes of developing ectotherms, we know remarkably little about the impacts of temperature fluctuations on the development of ectotherms. In this study, we used a meta-analytic approach to compare the mean and variance of phenotypic outcomes from constant and fluctuating incubation temperatures across reptile species. We found that fluctuating temperatures provided a small benefit (higher hatching success and shorter incubation durations) at cool mean temperatures compared with constant temperatures, but had a negative effect at warm mean temperatures. In addition, more extreme temperature fluctuations led to greater reductions in embryonic survival compared with moderate temperature fluctuations. Within the limited data available from species with temperature-dependent sex determination, embryos had a higher chance of developing as female when developing in fluctuating temperatures compared with those developing in constant temperatures. With our meta-analytic approach, we identified average mean nest temperatures across all taxa where reptiles switch from receiving benefits to incurring costs when incubation temperatures fluctuate. More broadly, our study indicates that the impact of fluctuating developmental temperature on some phenotypes in ectothermic taxa are likely to be predictable via integration of developmental temperature profiles with thermal performance curves.",,,,,"Riley, Julia/H-6756-2019; Noble, Daniel WA/H-6214-2013","Riley, Julia/0000-0001-7691-6910; Raynal, Rebecca/0000-0001-6932-2292; Noble, Daniel WA/0000-0001-9460-8743",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAR,2022,225,,,1,SI,,,,jeb243369,10.1242/jeb.243369,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.243369,,,,,,,,35258602,,,,,WOS:000766348200016,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a particularly vulnerable step in the transmission, trematode cercariae are directly exposed to ambient conditions during their search for a host. Here, we investigated the survival of cercariae of the intertidal trematode Maritrema novaezealandensis in a multifactorial experiment (2x2x2 design) with temperature (20 and 30 degrees C), salinity (35 and 40 practical salinity units (psu)) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR; exposed and not exposed) as main factors. All factors had significant effects, with cercariae dying faster at the higher temperature, increased salinity and when exposed to UVR. Full activity ceased within similar to 6 h in all treatments at 30 degrees C, except at 35 psu under no exposure to UV; in all other treatments full activity was maintained for >6 h. Several factor interactions were identified, of which the interactive negative effect of temperature and UVR was the most important. These results imply that conditions during the main transmission window of M. novaezealandensis are highly challenging for cercariae.

We quantified how the mean DLI influenced rooting and subsequent growth and development of two popular vegetatively propagated species, New Guinea impatiens (Impatiens hawkeri Bull.) and petunia (Petunia x hybrida hort. Vilm.-Andr.). Three cultivars of each species were propagated under a mean DLI ranging from 1.2 to 10.7 mol.m(-2).d(-1). Cuttings were rooted in a controlled greenhouse environment maintained at 24 to 25 degrees C with overhead mist, a vapor-pressure deficit of 0.3 kPa, and a 12-h photoperiod. Rooting and growth evaluations of cuttings were made after 8 to 16 d. In a separate experiment, rooted cuttings under DLI treatments were then transplanted into 10-cm containers and grown in a common greenhouse at 21 +/- 2 degrees C under a 16-h photoperiod to identify any residual effects on subsequent growth and development. In both species, rooting, biomass accumulation, and quality of cuttings increased and subsequent time to flower generally decreased as mean propagation DLI increased. For example, root number of petunia 'Tiny Tunia Violet Ice' after 16 days of propagation increased from 17 to 40 as the propagation DLI increased from 1.2 to 7.5 mol.m(-2).d(-1). In addition, cutting shoot height decreased from 6.3 to 4.5 cm, and root and shoot dry biomass of cuttings harvested after 16 days of propagation increased by 737% and 106%, respectively. Subsequent time to flower for 'Tiny Tunia Violet Ice' from the beginning of propagation decreased from 50 to 29 days as propagation DLI increased from 1.4 to 10.7 mol.m(-2).d(-1) regardless of the DLI provided after propagation. In New Guinea impatiens 'Harmony White', root and shoot dry weight of cuttings increased by 1038% and 82%, respectively, and subsequent time to flower decreased from 85 to 70 days as the propagation DLI increased from 1.2 to 10.7 mol.m(-2).d(-1).
