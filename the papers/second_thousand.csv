Our intention is to model complex systems of biological interest. We find that an effective temperature allows one to rationalize the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the system. This parameter is measured in several independent ways-from fluctuation-dissipation relations and by using tracer particles-and they all yield equivalent results. The effective temperature takes a higher value than the temperature of the bath when the effect of the motors is not correlated with the structural rearrangements they induce. We show how to use this concept to interpret experimental results and suggest possible innovative research directions.,,,,,"Mossa, Stefano/B-8230-2014; Cugliandolo, Leticia/M-9733-2013","Mossa, Stefano/0000-0001-6335-762X; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1744-683X,1744-6848,,,,,2011,7,8,,,,,3726,3729,,10.1039/c0sm01484b,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0sm01484b,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000289173500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Franco], western hemlock [Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.] and western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn) seedlings to determine the effects of temperature on whole-plant photosynthetic and stomatal responses to short-term fluctuations in irradiance (Q). Following a step change in Q, time constants (tau, the period over which 63% of the total change occurs) for stomatal conductance (g(s)) and assimilation rate (A) decreased linearly with increasing air temperature (T-air). For example, in western redcedar tau(A) decreased ham 30 +/- 4 min at 5 degrees C to 10 +/- 1 min at 25 degrees C. In all cases, tau(A) was within 10-15% of tau(gs). There was considerable variation in tau among individuals within a given species, Differences between species became more pronounced with decreasing temperature, Multiplicative models that included functions for tau accounted for 99% of the diurnal variability in A and g(s) for seedlings exposed to varying air temperature, irradiance and vapour pressure deficit, Estimates of daily A were within 2% of those measured. intermittent cloud cover and understory shading were approximated by exposing seedlings to 3-4 episodes (greater than or equal to 1 h) of shade (200 or 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) or complete darkness during the day. In such cases, daily A was overestimated by up Po 4 and 21%, respectively, if a function for tau was excluded from the models, Our results suggest that there is scope for selecting seedling stock for increased carbon assimilation on the basis of reduced time constants, For example, in western redcedar, a 40% reduction in tau could lead to increases in daily carbon gains of almost 5% depending on the frequency and degree of shading, If these daily gains were translated into increased dry matter production and compounded, seasonal gains would be even larger.",,,,,,"Pepin, Steeve/0000-0002-2003-5687",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-7791,,,,,DEC,1997,20,12,,,,,1462,1472,,10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-40.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-40.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000071562300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lizards in a laboratory thermal gradient were fed rodent meals of three different sizes (5, 10, or 20% of body mass), or sham fed (meal of 0% body mass), and T(b)s were recorded for three days before feeding and seven days after feeding. Gila monsters selected a mean T-b of 25.2 degrees C while fasting (set-point range 23.6-27.1), and increased T(b)s after feeding. The magnitude and duration of post-prandial T-b increases are positively related to meal size, and Gila monsters selected mean T(b)s up to 3.0 degrees C higher and maintain elevated T(b)s for 3-6 days after feeding. Selection of T-b does not appear to differ between day and night time periods, and because the lizards are both diurnal and nocturnal (at different times of year), photoperiod may not be an important influence on T-b selection.

Isarangkool Na; Rocheteau, A.",,,Transient thermal dissipation method for xylem sap flow measurement: implementation with a single probe,TREE PHYSIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Comparisons of tree water relations between treatments, species and sites are facilitated by the use of simple and low-cost measurements of xylem sap flow rates. The transient thermal dissipation (TTD) method is a variant of the constant thermal dissipation (CTD) method of Granier. It has the advantages of limiting thermal interference and of saving electrical energy. Here, our concern was to test a new step towards simplicity and low cost: the applicability of the TTD method with a single probe, i.e., without a reference sensor, following a cycle of 10 min heating and 10 min cooling, and using the same thermal index and multi-species calibration previously assessed with a dual probe. First, the responses of the dual and single probes were compared in an artificial hydraulic column of sawdust in the laboratory over a complete range of flux densities, from 0.3 to 4.0 l dm(-2) h(-1). Second, diurnal kinetics were compared in a young tree with rapid changes in the sapwood reference temperature of up to 5 degrees C h(-1) for 5 consecutive days. With a relatively stable reference temperature, laboratory results showed that a single probe yielded the same temperature signal and thermal index as a dual probe for the full range of sap flux densities. Within the tree, the cooled temperature of the heated probe, linearly interpolated, proved to be an accurate indicator of the change in the reference temperature over time. Logically, the temperature signals and estimates of sap flux density with the single probe did not differ from the dual-sensor measurements when the cooled temperature was interpolated. Additionally, the responses of the thermal index, yielded in the hydraulic experiment with the sawdust column, fell within the variability of the multi-species calibration. This result supports the previous assessment of a non-species-specific calibration for the TTD method with diffuse porous media. In conclusion, our results showed that the TTD method can be directly applied with a single probe. Limitations and possible future progress are pointed out. This measurement system is probably the simplest technique currently available to measure xylem sap flow.",,,,,"C., F./Q-8274-2019","Isarangkool Na Ayutthaya, Supat/0000-0002-5354-1527",,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,APR,2011,31,4,,,,,369,380,,10.1093/treephys/tpr020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpr020,,,,,,,,21498407,,,,,WOS:000290590100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective was to examine the effect of supplemental dietary organic selenium (Se) on improving semen quality and antioxidative status in male domestic fowls exposed to high ambient temperature. 2. Thirty-six Egyptian local cross males, 42 weeks old, were housed individually in cages in an open-sided building under 16 h L:8 h D and were provided with commercial feed and water ad libitum. In the house average daily temperature ranged from 33 to 36 degrees C and relative humidity from 60 to 70%. Birds were divided into 4 experimental treatments (n = 9) and were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 01, 02 or 03 mg organic Se/kg in the form of a yeast source (Sel-Plex (R)) for 8 weeks. 3. Under heat stress conditions, inclusion of organic Se in the cockerel diets enhanced the semen quality traits, including the sperm count and motility and reduced the percentage of dead sperms in a dose-dependent manner. 4. In seminal plasma, organic Se supplementation ameliorated some of the adverse effects of heat stress on lipid peroxidation and antioxidative properties. The inclusion of organic Se (03 mg/kg) in the cockerel diets doubled seminal plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, compared to controls and reduced lipid peroxidation. 5. In conclusion, supplemental dietary organic Se improved semen quality characteristics when cockerels were subjected to heat stress.

The data collected during these experiments are processed and discussed in order to evaluate the contribution to the thermal radiation of both long term and fluctuating parts of the temperature field. This study presents pioneering measurements about the heat transfer governing a wildfire spread in the open. Second, this work attempts to evaluate the incidence of fluctuations in thermal data. Using simple statistical assumptions we show that neglecting fluctuations of the thermal source can lead to underestimate the radiant flux density emitted ahead of the fire front and therefore, the related fire hazard.

During days of strong winds, the diurnal signal in surface temperature at the protected end of the bay (site CTGN) was attenuated and decoupled from the northern sites (ECIM and PCHC) which are directly exposed to wind forcing, suggesting that wind intensity drives shifts in the relative importance of physical transport processes across the bay. Overall, the mean settlement rates of both chthamaloids were higher at PCHC, whereas N.flosculus settled at higher rates in CTGN. Under strong wind conditions, settlement rates of both chthamaloids decreased at the northern sites, while the settlement of N. flosculus reached minima at all three sites. Moreover, the effect of wind stress on the spatial pattern of settlement across the bay differed between species. A significant and positive correlation between the spatial heterogeneity of settlement and maximum daily wind stress - used as a metric for the intensity of the afternoon sea breeze was found only for J. cirratus. It is concluded that daily changes in wind stress have a strong effect on the spatial pattern of diurnal temperature fluctuations, and on the spatial pattern of barnacle settlement around the bay. Such association emerges from the effect of wind on near-shore circulation and its differential modulation of thermal structure around an open embayment and, by extension, on the patterns of larval transport and onshore delivery to sites located at extremes of the bay, which probably is common in other bays with similar characteristics.

The effects of temperature on the development of Z. cucurbitae were investigated at eight constant temperatures. Freshly deposited egg and emerged larvae of Z. cucurbitae were used for experiment and the development of eggs, larvae and pupae was examined daily. With the exception of the lowest temperature (12.0 degrees C), Z. cucurbitae developed successfully from the egg stage to the adult stage at all the assessed temperatures. The lower developmental thresholds and thermal constants of each life stage were determined using linear regression. The lower and higher temperature thresholds were estimated using the Lobry-Rosso-Flandrois (LRF) and Sharpe-Schoolfield-Ikemoto (SSI) models. The lower developmental threshold and thermal constant from egg to adult emergence were 10.7 degrees C and 218.7 degree-days, respectively. The intrinsic optimum temperatures of the egg, larval, pupal and egg to pupal stages were 30.3, 24.4, 24.5, and 25.7 degrees C, respectively. Using the SSI model, we determined a temperature range of 23.1 degrees C (13.3-36.4 degrees C) for the total immature stage of Z. cucurbitae from lower and higher temperature threshold. The cumulative 50% adult emergence estimated using the SSI model was approximately 1 day later than that observed from Momordica charantia L., which was used for validating the distribution of adult Z. cucurbitae emergence. We elucidated the thermal performance of Z. cucurbitae using linear and non-linear models, and these models will contribute to the development of an effective management program for Z. cucurbitae.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0334-2123,1876-7184,,,,JUL,2022,50,3,,,,,601,616,,10.1007/s12600-022-00985-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-022-00985-5,,FEB 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000754342800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we used Phrynocephalus vlangalii females kept under seven thermal regimes for the whole gestation period to test the hypothesis that viviparity in high-altitude Phrynocephalus lizards is adaptive because embryos cannot fully develop without maternal thermoregulation. All females at 24 A degrees C and 93 % of the females at 28 A degrees C failed to give birth or produced stillborns, and proportionally fewer females gave birth at 29 or 35 A degrees C than at 32 A degrees C. Though the daily temperatures encountered were unsuitable for embryonic development, 95 % of the females in nature and 89 % of the females thermoregulating in the laboratory gave birth. There was no shift in the thermal preferences of females when they were pregnant. Although thermal conditions inside natural burrows were unsuitable for embryonic development, mass and sprint speed were both greater in neonates produced in nature. Our data show that (1) long-term exposure of P. vlangalii embryos to temperatures outside the range of 29-35 A degrees C may result in the failure of development, but daily or short-term exposure may not necessarily increase embryonic mortality; (2) low gestation temperatures slow but do not arrest embryonic development, and females produce high-quality offspring in the shortest possible time by maintaining gestation temperatures close to the upper thermal limit for embryonic development; and (3) viviparity is currently adaptive at high elevations because embryos in nature cannot fully develop without relying on maternal thermoregulation.

Rate estimates were made at three different temperatures in situ (0 degrees C), +3 degrees C and +6 degrees C over ambient. In situ Chlorophyll a (Chl a) doubled during the observation period to similar to 12 mu g Chl a L-1, with 60-97% of CM a in the >20 mu m size-fraction dominated by the diatom genus Chaetoceros. Herbivorous dinoflagellates comprised 60-80% of microplankton grazer biomass. At in situ temperatures, phytoplankton growth or grazing by herbivorous predators <200 mu m was not measurable until 11 days after observations commenced. Thereafter, phytoplankton growth was on average 0.25 d(-1). Phytoplankton mortality due to herbivorous grazing was only measured on three occasions but the magnitude was substantial, up to 0.58 d(-1). Grazing of this magnitude removed similar to 100% of primary production. In short-term temperature-shift incubation experiments, phytoplankton growth rate increased significantly (20%) at elevated temperatures. In contrast, herbivorous protist grazing and species-specific growth rates decreased significantly (50%) at +6 degrees C. This differential response in phytoplankton and herbivores to temperature increases resulted in a decrease of primary production removed with increasing temperature. Phaeocystis spp. abundance was negatively correlated with bulk grazing rate. Growth and grazing rates were variable but showed no evidence of an inherent, low temperature limitation. Herbivorous protist growth rates in this study and in a literature review were comparable to rates from temperate waters. Thus, an inherent physiological inhibition of protistan growth or grazing rates in polar waters is not supported by the data. The large variability between lack of grazing and high rates of primary production removal observed here and confirmed in the literature for polar waters implies larger amplitude fluctuations in phytoplankton biomass than slower, steady grazing losses of primary production.",,,,,"Franzé, Gayantonia/H-8378-2019; Franze, Gayantonia/AAI-7305-2020","Franze, Gayantonia/0000-0003-0028-4739; Lawrence, Caitlyn/0000-0002-3073-1715",,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,JUL 23,2018,6,,,,,,,,e5264,10.7717/peerj.5264,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.5264,,,,,,,,30057859,,,,,WOS:000439652700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Differences among breeds or lines of pigs in terms of growth and carcass characteristics may be affected by rearing environment (genetic x environment interaction). Aims. The present study compared the growth performance and carcass composition of pigs from two sire lines reared under constant thermoneutral (22 degrees C; TN) or high ambient temperature (33 degrees C; HT) conditions. Methods. Hampshire (HAM) and synthetic-cross (SYN) castrated male pigs (n = 12 per group; 32.0 +/- 2.0 kg) were kept in individual pens at either 22 degrees C (TN) or 33 degrees C (HT) for 55 days (two experimental phases: 0-27 and 28-55 days) following an adaptation period of 7 days. Throughout the experimental period, growth performance and body composition (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry on Days 27 and 55) were assessed, and a range of other measurements (serum parameters and physiological responses), which were divided into four measurement groups, was taken on 9 days. Key results. Irrespective of genetic line (G), the pigs in the HT treatment had lower average daily feed intake values (P < 0.001, by 29% and 41%) than did the pigs in the TN treatment during both experimental phases (0-27 and 28-55 days). During the second growth phase, the average daily gain of the SYN pigs in the HT treatment was reduced by 50%, whereas that of the HAM pigs was reduced by 24% (P < 0.05 for G x ambient temperature (AT)). On Days 27 and 55, pig bodyweight was lower (P < 0.05) in the HT treatment than in the TN treatment. On Day 27, a G x AT interaction was detected for backfat thickness (P < 0.05); among the SYN pigs, the value of this trait was lower (16%; P < 0.05) in the HT treatment than in the TN treatment, while for the HAM pigs, it was not influenced by treatment type.

Data were recorded on the same 14 Holstein-Friesian cows, at evening (15:00 to 16:00) milking every day over a 2-mo period. Surface temperature measurements of all udders were extracted from thermal images. After imaging, milk was extracted from each quarter and analyzed for SCC. Environmental and cow-related factors (i.e., ambient temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed, distance walked to the parlor, number of days since the udder was shaved, parity, and stage of lactation) were recorded on each day of the experiment. A large array of descriptive temperature parameters (DTP) were extracted from every udder image including temperature-based (e.g., maximum, average and minimum USST), pixel count-based, and textural-based DTPs. Several different analytical methods were tested in an attempt to relate any given DTP to SCC; this included investigating the relationship between USST and the log transform of SCC (i.e., somatic cell score; SCS). The temperature range within each udder was also compared with the natural log of the range in SCC of the respective quarters. In a separate analysis, the temperature difference between each DTP and its respective daily baseline (i.e., average of the 5 lowest values of that DTP across the herd) was compared with SCS. Finally, the association between environmental and cow-related factors with each DTP was investigated to create prediction models for each DTP, the residuals of which were compared with SCC. Results from the present study indicate that the correlation between any DTP and SCS was weak (range of -0.16 to 0.19) and so could not be used to identify quarters with high SCC. Although some alternative measures had a significant relationship with SCS, again, the correlation was too weak for practical use on its own. Maximum and average USST could be predicted with a root mean square error of 0.23 and 0.35 degrees C, respectively, although the residuals from the prediction model could not be used to identify animals with high SCC. This suggests that infrared thermography alone could not be used as a real-time automated tool to detect high SCC for dairy cows in a pasture-based system.",,,,,"McHugh, Noirin/R-4668-2016; Berry, Donagh/J-7616-2012","McHugh, Noirin/0000-0002-3105-8796; Berry, Donagh/0000-0003-4349-1447",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8812,1525-3163,,,,OCT,2018,96,10,,,,,4458,4470,,10.1093/jas/sky281,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jas/sky281,,,,,,,,30032183,,,,,WOS:000445881700037,View Full Record in Web of Science

Determination of the pest's population life table parameters is essential for understanding population development and growth under a variety of climates and as part of a pest risk analysis. The development, mortality and reproduction were studied in two pest populations (from Peru and Ecuador) in which cohorts of each life stage were exposed to different constant temperatures ranging from 10 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Using the Insect Life Cycle Modeling software, nonlinear equations were fitted to the data and an overall phenology model established to simulate life table parameters based on temperature. The temperature-dependent development curve was statistically well described for eggs by Ratkowsky's model and for larvae and pupae by Taylor's model. Variability in development time among individuals independent of temperature was significantly described by a log-logistic model. Temperature effects on immature mortality were described using different nonlinear models. Optimal temperature for survival was between 14 degrees and 17 degrees C. Temperature effects on adult senescence and oviposition time were described by simple exponential models; within-group variability was described by a Weibull distribution function. Fecundity per female due to temperature followed a nonlinear model indicating maximum reproduction at similar to 17 degrees C. The established model revealed good convergence with historical life tables established at fluctuating temperatures. The results confirm that S.tangolias is more adapted to cooler temperature than the common potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller). S.tangolias develops at temperatures within the range of 8-28.8 degrees C with a maximum finite rate of population increase (=1.053) at 21 degrees C. The established process-based physiological model can be used globally to simulate life table parameters for S.tangolias based on temperature and should prove helpful for evaluating the potential establishment risk and in adjusting pest management programmes.",,,,,"Sporleder, Marc/AAD-7961-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0931-2048,1439-0418,,,,APR,2017,141,3,,,,,202,218,,10.1111/jen.12321,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.12321,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000397474100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The causes for such trends have yet to be fully understood, although several factors including elevated temperatures and decreased atmospheric deposition of acid, nitrogen and sulfur, are considered responsible for the release of carbon from soils into streams. In order to determine how seasonal temperature patterns and soil physical and chemical characteristics influence iron (Fe)(III) reduction and DOC release to pore-water in subalpine wetland soils, we measured potential Fe(II) and DOC export rates at low (6 degrees C) and high (18 degrees C) temperatures using flow-through reactors containing undisturbed wetland soils sampled in the Fraser Experimental Forest (Colorado, USA) in two wetland types and at two depths. Higher temperature, soil organic matter, nitrogen, and extractable Fe concentrations, but lower soil C:N ratios and extractable manganese concentrations promoted Fe(II) export from soil to water. Additionally, Fe(III) reduction was 1.5-5 times more responsive to temperature in shallow, organic matter-rich soils, compared to organic-poor deeper soils. Conversely, DOC export declined at higher temperature in all soils, consistent with a temperature-related increase in carbon respiration by Fe(III)-reducers. While higher temperature is expected to reduce carbon storage in wetland soils, our findings suggest that temperature-related increase in Fe(III) reduction will not generate additional release of DOC from soils to rivers.

Early authors pointed to dry summers as the trigger; around 1980, the explanation was improved via modelling of historical data. The number of precipitation days and the July temperature proved to be important, and in experiments, moist soil caused considerable mortality. This information was used in preliminary forecasting with pheromone trap catches as biofix for estimations of occurrence and survival. As more precise information on temperature effects on growth and survival was needed, we performed experiments on growth and mortality effects on egg, all larval instars and pupae. We found clear positive relations between temperatures below 35 degrees C and development rates of eggs, all larval instars and pupae. Mortality was also affected, and low temperature caused pronounced mortality of young larvae. The severe mortality under cold, moist conditions versus high survival under warm, dry conditions may explain both the lack of relation between captures and injuries and the pronounced fluctuations of cutworm attacks in NW Europe reported from 1905 to present. These variations are likely to increase with the climate change and suggest a reanalysis of data on trap capture and injuries to improve decision support and sustainability in Integrated Pest Management.",,,,,"Sigsgaard, Lene/GQQ-6286-2022; Sigsgaard, Lene/F-7182-2014","Sigsgaard, Lene/0000-0001-6478-5079",,,,,,,,,,,,,2075-4450,,,,,JAN,2019,10,1,,,,,,,7,10.3390/insects10010007,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects10010007,,,,,,,,30621348,,,,,WOS:000457198700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

To simulate the impact of the real passengers, thermal passenger dummies were used. The spatial spreading of the heat released by the local source could be characterized for the state of the art mixing ventilation system (MV-mixing ventilation) and a novel ventilation system (CCDV-ceiling based cabin displacement ventilation), which provides fresh air at low momentum through the cabin ceiling. As expected, CCDV provides lower cabin temperatures due to its higher heat removal efficiency. While MV tends to accumulate the heat released by the local source in the passenger zone, warm air is able to ascend to the ceiling more easy at CCDV due to the lower inertia forces.

Temperature has pervasive effects on poikilotherm physiology, and embryos are especially vulnerable to temperature shifts. To identify critical windows, we incubated whitefish embryos at control temperatures of 2 degrees C, 5 degrees C, or 8 degrees C, and shifted treatments among temperatures at the end of gastrulation or organogenesis. Heart rate (f(H)) and oxygen consumption ((V) over dot(O2)) were measured across embryonic development, and Vo, was measured in 1-day old hatchlings. Thermal shifts, up or down, from initial incubation temperatures caused persistent changes in f(H) and ((V) over dot(O2)) compared to control embryos measured at the same temperature (2 degrees C, 5 degrees C, or 8 degrees C). Most prominently, when embryos were measured at organogenesis, shifting incubation temperature after gastrulation significantly lowered ((V) over dot(O2)) or f(H). Incubation at 2 degrees C or 5 degrees C through gastrulation significantly lowered ((V) over dot(O2)) (42% decrease) and f(H) (20% decrease) at 8 degrees C, incubation at 2 degrees C significantly lowered ((V) over dot(O2)) (40% decrease) and f(H) (30% decrease) at 5 degrees C, and incubation at 5 degrees C and 8 degrees C significantly lowered ((V) over dot(O2)) at 2 degrees C (27% decrease). Through the latter half of development, ((V) over dot(O2)) and f(H) in embryos were not different from control values for thermally shifted treatments. However, in hatchlings measured at 2 degrees C, ((V) over dot(O2)) was higher in groups incubated at 5 degrees C or 8 degrees C through organogenesis, compared to 2 degrees C controls (43 or 65% increase, respectively). Collectively, these data suggest that embryonic development through organogenesis represents a critical window of embryonic and hatchling phenotypic plasticity.

Little attention has been paid to the effects of thermal variation on competition within species. Understanding the temperature-dependence of competition is important since it might affect dynamics within and between populations. In a laboratory experiment we investigated the effects of thermal variation on growth and cannibalism in larvae of a damselfly. The temperature treatments included three amplitudes between 20 and 26 degrees C with an average of 23 degrees C, and a constant control at 23 degrees C. Larvae were also raised at five constant temperatures for an estimation of the thermal performance curve, which showed that the thermal optimum for growth was 26.9 degrees C. Cannibalism was significantly positively correlated with initial body size variance. There was neither a difference among the temperature variation treatments, nor between the constant and the variation treatments in growth and cannibalism. Hence, positive and negative effects of temperature variation within the linear range of a species thermal performance curve might cancel each other out.

In contrast, interspecific interactions clearly influenced the fitness of all three species, both positively and negatively. Temperature regime did have a substantial effect on the interactions between the species. In the two-species treatment, temperature regime altered the interaction from a sort of mutualism to commensalism. In addition, the strength of the interspecific interactions changed depending on the temperature regime in the three-species treatment.

In the morphospecies complex of the bacterivorous nematode Litoditis marina, four cryptic species (Pm I, Pm II, Pm III and Pm IV) frequently occur with mostly two or more of these species together. This co-occurrence displays fluctuating abundances that have been linked to seasonal dynamics in the environment. In intertidal marine environments, salinity and temperature play an important role in species distributions. In the here presented experiments, the impact of these two abiotic variables on juvenile development time, fecundity and population development was investigated. Monospecific cultures were reared at three different temperatures: 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C (salinity 25) and at two different salinities: 15 and 25 (temperature: 20 degrees C) in 2 separate experiments. Our results showed that differences in life history are present between the four species: Pm III had a higher instantaneous fecundity than the other three species. Furthermore, differences in reproduction strategy were observed between the cryptic species: Pm II and Pm III were always oviparous in this experiment, whilst Pm land Pm IV were mostly viviparous species. Abiotic factors affected the life history characters and the reproductive strategy of some of these cryptic species, with temperature clearly having a stronger effect than salinity. Temperature had an effect on juvenile development time for all species and a species-specific influence on population development. Pm III performed better at higher temperature, Pm II and Pm IV at lower temperature, whereas Pm I proved to be a more eurytherm species, which nicely correlates with their respective seasonal field distribution pattern in the south-eastern coast of the North Sea and adjacent estuaries. Juvenile development time was also influenced by salinity, with a shorter development time at the lower salinity for all cryptic species. Moreover, Pm III and Pm IV performed better at lower than at the higher salinity. Pm IV also changed its reproductive strategy, depending on the salinity. The effect of salinity was less clearly reflected in the geographical distribution of the four species. Different temperature preferences of the cryptic species on the other hand may result in niche differentiation and can provide an important mechanism for coexistence of these closely related species.

Microtubules deposited on prefabricated substrates were deformed in an atomic force microscope during imaging, in two different experimental geometries. Microtubules were modeled as anisotropic, with the Young's modulus corresponding to the resistance of protofilaments to stretching and the shear modulus describing the weak interaction between the protofilaments. Measurements involving radial compression of raicrotubules deposited on flat mica confirm that microtubule elasticity depends on the temperature. Bending measurements performed on microtubules deposited on lithographically fabricated substrates show that this temperature dependence is due to changing shear modulus, implying that the lateral interaction between the protofilaments is strongly determined by the temperature. These measurements are in good agreement with previously repot led measurements of the disassembly rate of microtubules, demonstrating that the mechanical and dynamic properties of microtubules are closely related.",,,,,"Kis, Andras/I-8882-2019; Kulik, Andrzej J/A-1236-2010; Kis, Andras/A-4631-2011","Kis, Andras/0000-0002-3426-7702; Kis, Andras/0000-0002-3426-7702",,,,,,,,,,,,,0743-7463,,,,,JUN 17,2008,24,12,,,,,6176,6181,,10.1021/la800438q,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/la800438q,,,,,,,,18494514,,,,,WOS:000256656500031,View Full Record in Web of Science

We report here on experiments using different stocks and selected lines of a tropical butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, to examine whether genotype-environment interactions occur for three traits describing pre-adult growth. These traits were measured over two pairs of environments differing in mean temperature, each of which had a constant, and a cycling temperature regime. Development time, pupal weight and growth rate show genotype-environment interactions, especially at comparatively low average temperatures.

The reproduction of parasitic isopods is thought to occur synchronously with host molting because the brood would be unsuccessful if molting occurred before the larvae were free swimming. Temperature affects the length of the molting cycle of shrimp, and therefore may also affect the incubation time of isopod broods. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of temperature on brood development of the parasite and on the degree of synchronization with the molting of its host. Parasitized P. pugio were monitored daily at 2 experimental temperatures, 23 and 15 C, in temperature-controlled chambers for the duration of a full parasite reproductive cycle. Developmental stage was determined by the visible coloration of the brood through the exoskeleton of the host, and was designated as egg, embryo I, embryo II, or epicaridium larvae. Temperature significantly affected median brood incubation time, which was only 11 days at 23 C, as compared to 35 days at 15 C. The final developmental stage (epicaridium larvae) was 3 times shorter at 23 C (median 3 days; n = 45) than at 15 C (median 9 days; n = 15). Temperature significantly affected the intermolt period of parasitized shrimp, which was shorter at 23 C (median 12 days) than at 15 C (median 37 days). A smaller percentage of the intermolt period elapsed between larval release and shrimp molting at 23 C (0.0%) than at 15 C (3.1%), indicating closer synchronization between host molting and parasite reproduction at the warmer temperature. At 15 C, the isopods utilized a smaller proportion of the time that was available for brood incubation during the intermolt period of their host. Brood size ranged from 391 to 4,596 young and was positively correlated with parasite and host size. Because development progressed more rapidly at 23 C, warmer temperatures could increase the prevalence of P. pandalicola. The corresponding reduction in the abundance of ovigerous grass shrimp as a result of sexual sterilization by bopyrids could adversely impact estuarine ecosystems, as grass shrimp are a crucial link in transferring energy from detritus to secondary consumers.",,,,,,"Brinton, Brigette/0000-0001-5361-8195",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3395,1937-2345,,,,AUG,2015,101,4,,,,,398,404,,10.1645/14-599.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/14-599.1,,,,,,,,25826017,,,,,WOS:000360297300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In LTM trials, we increased temperatures 0.3 degrees C/min and death occurred at 36.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C (mean +/- SE) for fish (37-49 turn total length) acclimated to 30 degrees C and at 36.4 +/- 0.07 degrees C for fish acclimated to 25 degrees C.

Arctic spring-streams, subject to extreme annual fluctuations in light but stable water temperatures, provide a rare contrast that allows the parsing of their independent effects. Over 30 months, we assessed the effects of light and temperature on ecosystem metabolism and nutrient uptake in Ivishak Spring, Alaska, USA. (latitude 69 degrees N, water temperature range approximate to 4 degrees-7 degrees C) using open-channel methods and short-term NH4+-N, NO3--N, and P additions, respectively. We predicted that rates of ecosystem respiration (ER) would mirror seasonal patterns of gross primary production (GPP), rather than temperature, due to relatively constant rates of metabolic demand year-round, resulting in carbon limitation during winter (October-March) when photosynthesis effectively ceases. Because patterns of nutrient uptake and GPP are often coupled due to assimilatory demand, we also predicted that extreme annual cycles of light would result in equally extreme cycles of nutrient uptake, with demand being relaxed during winter. In accordance with our prediction, we found that ER scaled linearly with GPP. Peak summer rates of GPP (>4.0 g Cm(-2)d(-1)) and ER (>5.0 g Cm(-2)d(-1)) were surprisingly high, being comparable to those of productive streams at temperate latitudes. Winter rates (GPP approximate to 0.0, ER <1.0 g Cm(-2)d(-1)) were low, however, and Arrhenius plots showed clear deviations from theoretical temperature dependence of GPP and ER during winter when other factors assumed primacy. For GPP, this factor was undoubtedly light availability, but for ER, carbon limitation is implicated due to low GPP. Significant nutrient uptake occurred only for NH4+-N, indicating N limitation, and rates of uptake were also synchronous with cycles of light availability. Consequently, light, rather than temperature, was the major driver of annual patterns of ER and nutrient cycles in this arctic ecosystem. Synchronous light and temperature cycles are pervasive among ecosystems. The winter onset and severity of energy limitation we document highlights the importance of this synchrony and how the confounding of light and temperature obscures details of mechanisms by which these fundamental drivers affect ecosystem processes.",,,,,"Parker, Stephanie/L-6580-2019","Parker, Stephanie/0000-0002-7180-7245",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,OCT,2014,95,10,,,,,2826,2839,,10.1890/13-1963.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-1963.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000344317300015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adult questing ticks were collected from vegetation following standard flagging procedures. The time series was evaluated by singular spectrum analysis. Correlation coefficients were calculated for the observed tick abundances and meteorological data (mean daily air temperature and precipitation) for the current year and preceding years. Analysis of the time series revealed the trend and harmonic components with periods of 8, 2.5 and 4years. Around 83% of the total variance is explained by the first principal component, which governs the general vector of changea gradual reduction in I. persulcatus abundance from 2003 to 2017. Correlations between tick abundance and climatic indices were observed in all years and were associated with both temperature and precipitation. The greatest number of significant coefficients was obtained for correlations between tick abundance and weather conditions in the preceding season. An equation was suggested where tick abundance is described by a linear function with four variables: mean air temperature in April and July, total precipitation in February, and annual number of days with temperatures above 5 degrees C. Thus, the observed long-term dynamics are characterized by the following key patterns: a sharp population rise early in the 2000s, some recent decline (stabilization) of the abundance, the presence of quasi-periodic cycles, and a close correlation between tick abundance and climatic variables.",,,,,"Bugmyrin, Sergey V/L-7750-2013","Bugmyrin, Sergey V/0000-0001-5285-6933",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-8162,1572-9702,,,,FEB,2019,77,2,,,,,229,240,,10.1007/s10493-019-00342-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-019-00342-y,,,,,,,,30758799,,,,,WOS:000460581000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moulting was seasonal, with crayfish entering pre- and postmoult between May and August. Haemolymph pHa levels declined in the spring when temperatures increased from 8 to 18-degrees-C (DELTApH/DELTAt=0.013 pH units degrees-C-1). This decrease was accompanied by a fall in [HCO3-] (of 4.12 mmol l-1) and [lactate] (of 4.71 mmol l-1) and a premoult elevation in P(CO2) to 0.59 kPa. After ecdysis, when water temperatures and pH were at their maxima, pHa levels increased, they continued to increase as temperature fell in late summer, reaching 7.97 in intermoult crayfish at 13-degrees-C during September. This increase was accompanied by a decrease in P(CO2) to 0.22 kPa at constant [HCO3-] (5-6 mmol l-1). Between September (13-degrees-C) and October (11-degrees-C) pHa fell to 7.87 with an elevation in P(CO2) (of 0.18 kPa) and [lactate] (of 1.84 mmol l-1). As temperature continued to decrease (11-1-degrees-C), pHa remained unchanged despite an elevation in [HCO3-] by 2.4 mmol l-1 at constant P(CO2). A mechanism accounting for the unvarying haemolymph pH values at low temperatures is proposed, stressing the importance of temperature-related seasonal changes in CO2 Solubility and measured values for pK1' in addition to adjustments in [HCO3-] and P(CO2).

For each mussel species (except Q. pustulosa), treatments tested included two water temperatures (25 and 10 degrees C), five air temperatures (ranging within +/-20 degrees C of the water temperature), three aerial exposure durations (15, 30, and 60 min), and a no emersion control. All treatments were duplicated, with 10 organisms per emersion time and aerial exposure temperature (n = 320 mussels per test). Behavioral response (ability to upright) and mortality were measured daily for 14 d postemersion. Both water and aerial exposure temperature (air shock) were important predictors of times to first uprighting. The intensity function of first uprighting differed among species (P < 0.01), and there was a significant interaction between E. dilatata versus the other species and water temperature (P +/- 0.01). Over-all mussel survival after emersion was high (93%); however, E. dilatata experienced significant treatment related mortality at the 25 degrees C test water, 45 degrees C aerial exposure temperature. Because of the high incidence of uprighting and survival of mussels in our study, emersion at moderate temperatures (15 to 35 degrees C) and durations (15 to 60 min) does not seem harmful to mussels, and, therefore, conducting relocations and status surveys under these conditions should not impair mussel survival and over-all success.",,,,,,"Bartsch, Michelle/0000-0002-9571-5564",,,,,,,,,,,,,0730-8000,,,,,JUN,2000,19,1,,,,,233,240,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088636000038,View Full Record in Web of Science

That knowledge is needed for their use in different cultivation zones in Finland however. We examined the effect of different preconditioning temperatures (3, -3, -7 and -10 degrees C) and their durations (one or three weeks) on FH of two cultivars of apple (Malus domestica), three cultivars of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) and three cultivars of blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum) to find out the condition for reaching FHmax. FH was assessed by controlled freezing tests at different temperatures. Frost damage was determined by electrical impedance (EIS), relative electrolyte leakage (REL) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) of stems, and by visual damage scoring (VD) of stems and buds. In apple, FH of stems was at the highest (-43 degrees C) at a preconditioning temperature of -7 degrees C and the lowest (-18 degrees C) at 3 degrees C as assessed by REL and EIS respectively. By DTA, low temperature exotherm (LTE) was observed at the lowest at around -40 degrees C in both apple cultivars after preconditioning at -7 degrees C. The highest level of FH in blueberry (from -39 degrees C to -45 degrees C) and in blackcurrant (from -39 degrees C to -50 degrees C) was found in all cultivars after preconditioning at -3 degrees C or -7 degrees C by EIS and REL. Some additional hardening especially in apple and blueberry was found with prolonged preconditioning for 3 weeks.

We find that because ice particle grain sizes are very small compared to the 0.5-2 GHz wavelengths, volume scattering effects are small. Variations in firn density over cm-to m-length scales, however, cause significant effects. Both incoherent and coherent models are used to examine these effects. Incoherent models include a cloud model that neglects any reflections internal to the ice sheet, and the DMRT-ML and MEMLS radiative transfer codes that are publicly available. The coherent model is based on the layered medium implementation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem for thermal microwave radiation from a medium having a nonuniform temperature. Density profiles are modeled using a stochastic approach, and model predictions are averaged over a large number of realizations to take into account an averaging over the radiometer footprint. Density profiles are described by combining a smooth average density profile with a spatially correlated random process to model density fluctuations. It is shown that coherent model results after ensemble averaging depend on the correlation lengths of the vertical density fluctuations. If the correlation length is moderate or long compared with the wavelength (similar to 0.6x longer or greater for Gaussian correlation function without regard for layer thinning due to compaction), coherent and incoherent model results are similar (within similar to 1 K). However, when the correlation length is short compared to the wavelength, coherentmodel results are significantly different from the incoherent model by several tens of kelvins. For a 10-cm correlation length, the differences are significant between 0.5 and 1.1 GHz, and less for 1.1-2 GHz.

Extreme temperature events are short periods of high temperature (i.e., >95th percentile of temperature distribution), and their occurrences are difficult to predict. These extreme temperature events pose great challenges to living organisms, especially ectotherms such as insects whose body temperature is greatly influenced by environmental temperature. Temperature is known to play an essential role in driving insect performance as well as inducing behavioral changes. Exposure to extreme temperatures causes physiological damage leading to potential long-lasting effects on insect performance. We aimed at assessing the impact of direct (i.e., current) and indirect (previously experienced) exposure to extreme temperature on the oviposition success of Diadegma semiclausum Hellen (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). Diadegma semiclausum is a larval endoparasitoid of Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), a worldwide pest of brassicaceous crops. Oviposition success, measured as the percentage of parasitized P. xylostella, was significantly lower at 33 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. However, previous exposure to 33 degrees C did not significantly impact the egg-laying performance of D. semiclausum, indicating that, after a heatwave, the egg-laying performance can recover. Neither the direct nor indirect exposure to extreme temperature altered D. semiclausum host-instar preference. These results indicate that temperature directly impacts D. semiclausum parasitism performance, although more detailed research is needed to disentangle direct physiological mechanisms from behavioral responses. Overall, these study results confirm others, suggesting that control of P. xylostella by D. semiclausum is likely to be impaired by more frequent heatwaves predicted under climate change scenarios.",,,,,"; Dicke, Marcel/B-2300-2010","Gols, Rieta/0000-0002-6839-8225; Dicke, Marcel/0000-0001-8565-8896; Costaz, Thibault Pierre Marius/0000-0003-4721-5060",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,1570-7458,,,,AUG,2022,170,8,,,SI,,656,665,,10.1111/eea.13197,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.13197,,JUN 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000808382800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Environmental variability during seed development can present important problems for the grower, particularly when that variability is in the form of high temperatures. In conventional experiments, heat stress is implemented suddenly, with a temperature increase of 20 degreesC being implemented in several minutes, whereas in normal field conditions, atmospheric temperatures usually increase over a number of days. Growth cabinet experiments to determine the effects of contrasting heat stresses during seed development were conducted on 3 cultivars of canola, namely, Monty, Range, and Oscar. The control comprised 21 degreesC days and 16 degreesC nights. One treatment comprised a rapid increase to 40 degreesC, which was then maintained for 4 h on 5 successive days, giving a total of 15 degree-days of stress (15 DD/40 degreesC). The second treatment comprised 5 days of stepwise increase in daily maximum temperature to 40 degreesC, giving a total of 45 degree-days above control conditions (45 DD/stepped). The 15 DD/40 degreesC heat treatment accelerated plant maturity and resulted in drastically decreased seed weight, and therefore yield, compared with the control, whereas the 45 DD/stepped treatment had much less effect on the 3 lines, particularly Oscar. Oil concentration of the seed was reduced following the 15 DD/40 degreesC treatment by a half in Range, a quarter in Monty, and a fifth in Oscar, in contrast to reductions of a third, a tenth, and nil following the 45 DD/stepped treatment. The 15 DD/40 degreesC stress was also associated with much greater increases in protein and glucosinolate concentrations over control values than the 45 DD/stepped stress. The 15 DD/40 degreesC treatment had a pronounced effect on fatty-acid composition, increasing saturated fatty-acid content and decreasing oleic acid content, in both Monty and Range but not in Oscar, whereas the 45 DD/stepped treatment had no significant effect on fatty-acid composition. These results show that although the gradual temperature increase as implemented in this experiment resulted in a greater degree-days heat load, it was not as detrimental to quality as a sudden increase. The cultivars varied in their responses to the heat load.",,,,,"Stoddard, Frederick/E-6436-2015","Stoddard, Frederick/0000-0002-8097-5750",,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-9409,1836-5795,,,,,2001,52,8,,,,,817,824,,10.1071/AR00120,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR00120,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000170044700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A Test Using Parthenogenetic Geckos,PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many lineages of parthenogenetic organisms have persisted through significant environmental change despite the constraints imposed by their fixed genotype and limited evolutionary potential. The ability of parthenogens to occur sympatrically with sexual relatives may in part be due to phenotypic plasticity in their responses to their environment, especially with respect to incubation temperature-a maternally selected trait. Here we measured the incubation temperatures selected by two lineages of triploid parthenogenic geckos in the Heteronotia binoei complex by allowing them to deposit clutches along a thermal gradient. The average nest temperature selected was 28.4 degrees C, with no significant differences between parthenogenic races or individual clones. To investigate the effect of nest-temperature variability on physiological and morphological traits, we incubated eggs from different races at one of four incubation regimes (32 degrees +/- 0 degrees, +/-3 degrees, +/-5 degrees, or +/-9 degrees C). Embryos incubated at constant 32 degrees C developed faster than embryos reared under increasing extremes of diel temperature fluctuation (+/-3 degrees, +/-5 degrees C), and incubation at 32 degrees +/- 9 degrees C was unsuccessful. Incubation regime had no effect on the body size, preferred substrate temperature, or mass-specific (V) over dotO(2) of hatchlings.. However, parthenogenic race had a significant effect on egg mass, tail length, snout-to-vent length, total length, and (V) over dotO(2) We conclude that developmental traits are strongly influenced by clonal genotypes in this parthenogenic complex but are well buffered against fluctuations in incubation temperature.",,,,,"Mitchell, Nicola J/K-5277-2012; Andrewartha, Sarah/K-4189-2012; Mitchell, Nicola/AAE-4132-2020","Mitchell, Nicola J/0000-0003-0744-984X; Andrewartha, Sarah/0000-0003-1973-9502; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,1537-5293,,,,JUL-AUG,2010,83,4,,,,,597,607,,10.1086/652245,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/652245,,,,,,,,20477533,,,,,WOS:000278785100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) in air and on water for a small diving bird, the Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus), and compared these results to published data for other diving birds of diverse taxa and sizes. For 8 Cassin's auklets (similar to 165 g), the lower critical temperature was higher on water (21 degrees C) than in air (16 degrees C). Lowest values of RMR (W kg(-1)) averaged 19% higher on water (12.14 +/- 3.14 SD) than in air (10.22 +/- 1.43). At lower temperatures, RMR averaged 25% higher on water than in air, increasing with similar slope. RMR was higher on water than in air for alcids, cormorants, and small penguins but not for diving ducks, which appear exceptionally resistant to heat loss in water. Changes in RMR (W) with body mass either in air or on water were mostly linear over the 5- to 20-fold body mass ranges of alcids, diving ducks, and penguins, while cormorants showed no relationship of RMR with mass.

Yield loss became smaller in cultivars with increasing levels of resistance in adult plant reaction and did not appear in cultivars with seedling susceptibility and moderate or better adult plant reaction levels in the 3 years when epidemics began after emergence of the flag leaf. However, in 1984 the stripe rust epidemic began during stem elongation, and yield losses of up to 21% occurred in cultivars with seedling susceptibility and a moderate or better adult plant reaction. Yield was significantly negatively correlated with the proportion of leaf area affected by stripe rust at stages of crop development from the end of heading to late milk. The correlation was greatest at the early milk stage of growth where the relationship was logarithmic. Two factors significantly influenced this relationship. Yield loss increased as the length of the epidemic increased, and decreased as temperature increased during grain development. The relationship that was developed for predicting yield loss accounted for 80.5% of the variance across all experiments, and was: y = 100(1 - e(-10-4X(393 + 1.65L - 14.1T))) where y = yield loss (%); X = stripe rust (leaf area affected, range 0-99%) at early milk; L = time from 1% disease to early milk (range 0-70 days); and T = mean daily maximum temperature from 7 days before to 14 days after early milk (range 19.8-27.5 degrees C).",,,,,"cullis, brian r/E-7078-2010","Cullis, Brian/0000-0001-6319-8155",,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-0862,,,,,APR,1994,43,2,,,,,397,405,,10.1111/j.1365-3059.1994.tb02701.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.1994.tb02701.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NN15300021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Simulations using this model show that monotonic temperature rise or fall only affects the oscillations amplitude and frequency. In contrast, fluctuating temperature can induce irregular periodicity, aperiodic outbursts of varying magnitude and duration and/or extinction, depending on the temperature fluctuations' complexity, and frequency relative to that of the biological system's own. This suggests that coupling of the regular oscillations of a population or biological process, with temperature or other fluctuations in its environment could be a cause of irregular and apparently chaotic patterns, at least in principle. For lack of suitable data, the described model is yet to be validated. However, it is a testable model that could be confirmed experimentally by future research. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Assuming a linear response, therefore, overestimates spore release from decaying leaves. The calculated discrepancy was more pronounced with recalcitrant oak leaves (greater toughness, phenolics concentration, lower N and P concentration than alder), and reached 26.6 % when temperature was assumed to oscillate between 1 and 9 A degrees C, rather than remaining constant at 5 A degrees C. The maximum fluctuation of water temperature over 48 h during the field experiment was approximately 3 A degrees C, which would result in a discrepancy of up to 6 %.

Sows on CW (both 10 and 15 degrees C) consumed more feed and water than did control (P < 0.01) and higher estimated milk production compared with control (P < 0.01), but had lower rectal temperature and respiration rate compared with control (P < 0.01). Mean weaning weight (P < 0.01) and average daily gain (P < 0.01) of litters in CW groups were higher than those in control group. There were no differences in the measured variables, with the exception of the respiration rates, between the two CW treatment groups. These results suggest that CW may improve the performance of sows and their litters exposed to high ambient temperatures and the 15 degrees C water, from an energy viewpoint, may be more effective.

S. Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment/Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC). Comparisons show that most reports in the ICOADS and FNMOC are of the same origin as NCEP GTS. Quality control (QC) information is either unavailable (NCEP), not well documented (FNMOC), or nonuniform (ICOADS, FNMOC). Preliminary QC was implemented in this study and uniformly applied to all data sets. All analyses are stratified by major types of in situ platforms including ships, drifters, and moored buoys, the latter being further subdivided into tropical and coastal. Ships overwhelmingly prevailed before 1990 but then declined, whereas the number of drifters significantly increased, as did their reporting density. Although both platforms sample the full SST range well, drifters cover the global ocean much more uniformly than ships. Statistical analyses are performed on the in situ SST anomalies with respect to daily Reynolds and daily Pathfinder. Different global mean biases are observed for different platform types (e. g., similar to+0.03 K for drifters and tropical moorings and similar to+0.15 K for ships, with respect to Reynolds SST), suggesting existence of cross-platform biases that need to be reconciled. Root mean square (RMS) errors of the four types of in situ data have been estimated via three-way analyses proposed in O'Carroll et al. (2008). The geographical distributions of RMS errors in Pathfinder, Reynolds, and in situ SSTs show distinct spatial patterns, which require further understanding and remediation.",,,,,"Ignatov, Alexander/F-5594-2010; XU, Feng/A-4582-2010","Ignatov, Alexander/0000-0002-7463-5944; XU, Feng/0000-0002-7015-1467",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,SEP 22,2010,115,,,,,,,,C09022,10.1029/2010JC006129,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JC006129,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000282325100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Survival rate (percent adult emergence from parasitized host eggs) varied significantly among the experimental temperatures, with the highest (59%) and lowest (0%) occurring at 30.4 and 33.8 degrees C, respectively. The survival rates (%) were fitted with a polynomial model to describe a temperature-dependent pattern. Developmental rates (1/d) across seven temperatures were fitted with the nonlinear Briere model, which estimated the lower threshold to be 8.06 degrees C, the optimal temperature to be 29.22 degrees C, and the upper threshold to be 33.49 degrees C. A linear model fitted to developmental rates at 14.8-28.7 degrees C indicated that 189.75 degree-days above the lower threshold of 9.71 degrees C were required to complete development. A simulation model of G. morgani adult emergence was constructed to predict daily counts over the entire range of constant temperatures by incorporating the survival rate model, the Briere model, and the Weibull model. In outdoor validation, a degree-day model for predicting adult emergence showed <= 2 d differences between prediction and observation. Based on the observed temperature requirement, the insect could complete thirteen to sixteen generations per year in southern California, depending on weather and location.

Historical data from 1961-2000 indicate these temperature fluctuations may seriously affect grain yield of winter wheat crops. In this study, a field air temperature control system (FATC) was used to simulate the winter warming, spring cold and freezing events in the field experiment in 2010-2011 to explore their impacts on growth and yield of winter wheat. Eight elite wheat varieties released during 1961-2000 were included and four temperature scenarios were applied, including late spring freeze alone, winter warming + late spring freeze, early spring cold + late spring freeze and the normal temperature condition as control. Winter warming combined with late spring freeze significantly decreased tiller survival rate, leaf photosynthetic rate and leaf growth in wheat plants, and reduced the spike number and kernel number per spike, and the final grain yield. In contrast, the wheat plants experienced early spring cold had higher tiller survival rate, leaf photosynthetic capacity and sugar accumulation and improved tolerance to the late spring freeze, resulting in less yield loss, as compared with those without experiencing early spring cold. Both the meta-analyses and the field experimental data demonstrated that the effects of later spring freeze stress on wheat yield were exacerbated by winter warming but were extenuated by early spring cold events.

A total of 120 juveniles (initial body weight: 132 +/- 4.2 g) were stocked in triplicate groups (10 individual per replicate) in 12 fiberglass tanks (500 L capacity). Four temperature regimes were applied: The first group was maintained as control at constant 22 +/- 0.6 degrees C (mean temperature around which the temperature of the other test trials fluctuated). The second group was exposed to temperature fluctuations between 19 and 25 degrees C over a 24 h cycle, starting with the upward part of the cycle during daytime (feeding period). The third group started the exposure of the 24 h temperature cycle at the higher value (at 25 degrees C; declining over the daytime) while the fourth group was exposed to two complete daily cycles of the same temperature fluctuations (between 19 and 25 degrees C). Biometry of fish (total length and weight) was determined monthly. Blood samples were also collected every month and body composition was determined at the end of the experiment. After 17 weeks final weights were significantly affected by the daily temperature fluctuations (P < 0.05). The highest final weight and SGR was recorded in regime 2 followed by the control. The Highest body protein and lowest body lipid were recorded in fish exposed to the fourth temperature regime (two full temperature cycles in 24 h). Fish reared under this temperature regime also showed significantly lower blood plasma glucose levels than the other treatments (P < 0.05). Hemoglobin and hematocrit content in blood samples were not affected by any of the tested daily temperature fluctuations (P > 0.05). The leukocyte count increased slightly in regimes 2 and 4 compared to regime 1 (control) but differences were not significant (P > 0.05).

This study assessed the effect of low temperature on the outdoor establishment potential of E. eremicus in Britain. The developmental threshold calculated by three linear methods was between 6.1degrees and 11.6 degreesC, with a degree-day requirement per generation between 256.3 and 366.8degrees day(-1). The supercooling points of non-acclimated and acclimated larvae were similar (approximately -25 degreesC). Non-acclimated and acclimated larvae were subject to considerable pre-freeze mortality, with lethal temperature (LTemp(50)) values of -16.3 and -21.3 degreesC, respectively. Lethal time experiments indicated a similar lack of cold tolerance with 50% mortality of both non-acclimated and acclimated larvae after 7 days at -5 degreesC, 10 days at 0 degreesC and 13 days at 5 degreesC. Field trials showed that neither non-acclimated nor acclimated larvae survived longer than 1 month when exposed to naturally fluctuating winter temperatures.

To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the growth as a function of temperature. The temperature is often not constant in various stages of distribution. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of shifts in temperature. The suitability and usefulness of several models to describe the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum with fluctuating temperatures was evaluated. It can be assumed that temperature shifts within the lag phase can be handled by adding relative parts of the lag time to be completed and that temperature shifts within the exponential phase result in no lag phase. With these assumptions, the kinetic behavior of temperature shift experiments was reasonably well predicted, and this hypothesis was accepted statistically in 73% of the cases. Only shifts of temperature around the minimum temperature for growth showed very large deviations from the model prediction. The best results were obtained with the assumption that a temperature shift (within the lag phase as well as within the exponential phase) results in an additional lag, phase. This hypothesis was accepted statistically in 93% of the cases.

This analysis was carried out in a series of field experiments in northern and southern France over several seasons and years, and in growth chamber experiments. LER was measured with 10 min steps, together with meristem temperature, VPD and PPFD at leaf level in three types of experiments: in growth chamber experiments with steps in PPFD or VPD at constant meristem temperature, in growth chamber experiments with several combinations of constant, but contrasting, PPFDs, VPDs and meristem temperatures, and in the field with fluctuating conditions. (i) When evaporative demand was low (night or day with low air VPD), LER was only linked to meristem temperature, regardless of other climatic conditions. (ii) Light had no effect per se on LER in the range from 0 to 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for time-scales longer than 2 h, provided that its indirect effects on meristem temperature and on evaporative demand were corrected (in the growth chamber) or taken into account (in the field), and provided that cumulated PPFD over a weekly time-scale was compatible with field conditions. (iii) Evaporative demand sensed by growing leaves, as estimated by meristem-to-air vapour pressure difference, markedly affected LER in the range from 1-4 kPa, at all time-scales under study, with a unique relationship in the growth chamber (constant conditions) and in the field (fluctuating conditions). This effect was only observed when PPFD was high enough for stomata to open. The negative effect of evaporative demand on LER was probably not due to long distance root-to-shoot signalling, since soil was wet, calculated root water potential remained close to 0 MPa and concentration of ABA in the xylem sap was very low. Therefore, it is proposed to model maize LER with a two-step process, involving the calculation of the maximum LER at a given meristem temperature and then the calculation of the reduction in LER due to evaporative demand. Joint analysis of the whole set of data by using the two equations yielded a r(2) of 0.75. This two-step process would be more accurate than the provision of LER from temperature only in cases where air VPD frequently exceeds 2 kPa.",,,,,"Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,,,,,NOV,1996,47,304,,,,,1689,1698,,10.1093/jxb/47.11.1689,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/47.11.1689,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996WA29200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such variations may have important implications on the distribution and on aquaculture site selection. The upper and lower temperature tolerances and the percentage of byssal attachment at different temperatures (11 to 35 degreesC) were studied for spat, juvenile and adult scallops. The lethal and sublethal effects of reduced salinity (13parts per thousand to 33parts per thousand) on spat, juvenile and adult scallops were studied at ambient temperature (23.5 degreesC) and on spat also at low (16 degreesC) and high (29 degreesC) temperatures during 96-h bioassays. In addition, the influences of short exposure (1 h) to low salinity (13parts per thousand and 17parts per thousand) at different temperatures (16 and 28 degreesC), and the effects of exposure (2 and 4 h) to high temperature (33 degreesC) at ambient salinity (33parts per thousand) were studied. N. nodosus is a moderately eurythermal but stenohaline tropical species, adults having lower tolerance to high temperature and low salinity than spat. Lethal temperatures for a 48-h exposure (LT50) were 29.8 degreesC for adult and juveniles, and 31.8 degreesC for spat. Maximum rate of byssal attachment occurred in a narrower temperature range for juveniles and adults (23 to 27 degreesC) than for spat (19 to 27 degreesC), which are suggested as the optimum ranges of temperatures for growth. Lethal salinities (LC50) for a 48-h exposure at ambient temperature were 23.2parts per thousand, 23.6parts per thousand and 20.1parts per thousand for adults, juveniles and spat, respectively, but the percent byssal attachment was significantly reduced below salinities of 29parts per thousand indicating that scallops were physiologically stressed. A 1-h exposure to 17parts per thousand was lethal to spat at 28 degreesC, but at 16 degreesC there was a 28.5% survival, 96 It after the exposure. Temperatures and salinity in coastal areas of southern Brazil can reach levels leading to sublethal effects, and in some sites, it may surpass the limits of tolerance for the survival of the species.

The simulation is validated with short-term, long-term and cross-section temperature measurements. For diurnal sea surface temperature (SST) a correlation between 0.79 and 0.89 was obtained. Comparisons with observed sea surface temperatures from Helgoland Roads (1873-2007) in the German Bight indicate a moderate warm bias in the order of 0.5 degrees C; but relatively high correlation of 0.89 suggests that long-term variability and change are simulated reasonably. Biases at other stations appear to be negligible. Analysis of hindcast temperatures reveals that SSTs in the German Bight remained relatively constant until the mid 1980s with some inter-annual variability superimposed. Later a strong increase in SST was found reaching values of up to 0.05 degrees C-1 year between 1988 and 2007. A similar behaviour was identified in observations from Helgoland, the only station for which a long temperature record was available. The heat content for the entire North Sea region showed a comparable development, indicating that the surface warming observed over the last decades extends over a larger depth range. The variability of stratification is mainly dominated by year-to-year variability. A number of sensitivity experiments are performed, confirming existing hypotheses, that the local air-sea interactions are the main drivers behind the observed changes in North Sea heat content and SST and in particular for the strong warming emerging in the mid 1980s in the North Sea.

Here, we examined the phytoplankton community composition before, during, and after a simulated 1-month heat wave in a mesocosm facility in Silkeborg, Denmark. The experiment was conducted over three contrasting temperature scenarios (ambient (A0), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario (circa +3 degrees C, A2) and A2+ %50 (circa +4.5 degrees C, A2+)) crossed with two nutrient levels (low (LN) and high (HN)) with four replicates. The facility includes 24 mesocosms mimicking shallow lakes, which at the time of our experiment had run without interruption for 11 years. The 1-month heat wave effect was simulated by increasing the temperature by 5 degrees C (1 July to 1 August) in A2 and A2+, while A0 was not additionally heated. Throughout the study, HN treatments were mostly dominated by Cyanobacteria, whereas LN treatments were richer in genera and mostly dominated by Chlorophyta. Linear mixed model analyses revealed that high nutrient conditions were the most important structuring factor, which, regardless of temperature treatments and heat waves, increased total phytoplankton, Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Cyanobacteria biomasses and decreased genus richness and the grazing pressure of zooplankton. The effect of temperature was, however, modest. The effect of warming on the phytoplankton community was not significant before the heat wave, yet during the heat wave it became significant, especially in LN-A2+, and negative interaction effects between nutrient and A2+ warming were recorded. These warming effects continued after the heat wave, as also evidenced by Co-inertia analyses. In contrast to the prevailing theory stating that more diverse ecosystems would be more stable, HN were less affected by the heat wave disturbance, most likely because the dominant phytoplankton group cyanobacteria is adapted to high nutrient conditions and also benefits from increased temperature. We did not find any significant change in phytoplankton size diversity, but size evenness decreased in HN as a result of an increase in the smallest and largest size classes simultaneously. We conclude that the phytoplankton community was most strongly affected by the nutrient level, but less sensitive to changes in both temperature treatments and the heat wave simulation in these systems, which have been adapted for a long time to different temperatures. Moreover, the temperature and heat wave effects were observed mostly in LN systems, indicating that the sensitivity of phytoplankton community structure to high temperatures is dependent on nutrient availability.",,,,,"Lauridsen, Torben L/K-9417-2013; Öğlü, Burak/V-6027-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Søndergaard, Martin/P-2417-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012","Öğlü, Burak/0000-0002-3302-2500; Søndergaard, Martin/0000-0002-1514-0482; Davidson, Thomas/0000-0003-2326-1564; Lauridsen, Torben/0000-0003-0139-2395; CAO, YU/0000-0003-2716-6580; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2073-4441,,,,DEC,2020,12,12,,,,,,,3394,10.3390/w12123394,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12123394,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000602931000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a first experiment, seven Pelibuey and seven Suffolk ewes were kept in a climatic chamber for 6 h daily during 10 days (temperatures within the 18 to 39.5 A degrees C range). As chamber temperature rose, sheep rectal temperature increased in both groups, but to a lesser extent in Pelibuey (0.3 A degrees C) than in Suffolk sheep (0.7 A degrees C) (P < 0.05). In a second experiment, cellular viability was assessed using cultured blood mononuclear cells from 15 Pelibuey and 15 Suffolk sheep. They were incubated at 37 A degrees C for 24 h (control) or 43 A degrees C for 6 h followed by 18 h at 37 A degrees C (HS). In a third experiment, another blood mononuclear cells culture from eight Pelibuey and eight Suffolk sheep was kept at 37 A degrees C for 15 h; these were subsequently cultured for 6 h at 37 A degrees C (controls) or 43 A degrees C (HS). Next, HSP-70 concentration was determined. HS reduced the percentage of viable cells to a greater extent in Suffolk [37 A degrees C (73.7 %) vs. 43 A degrees C (61.9 %); P < 0.05] than in Pelibuey sheep [37 A degrees C (74.9 %) vs. 43 A degrees C (66.7 %); P > 0.05]. HS significantly increased HSP-70 average concentrations for both breeds at 43 A degrees C.

Most of our understanding of thermal physiology of intertidal organisms has come from laboratory experiments that acclimate organisms to submerged conditions and steady-state increases in temperatures. For organisms experiencing the ebb and flow of tides with unpredictable low tide aerial temperatures, the reliability of reported tolerances and thus predicted responses to climate change requires incorporation of environmental complexity into empirical studies. Using the mussel Mytilus californianus, our study examined how stochasticity of the thermal regime influences physiological performance. Mussels were acclimated to either submerged conditions or a tidal cycle that included either predictable, unpredictable or no thermal stress during daytime low tide. Physiological performance was measured through anaerobic metabolism, energy stores and cellular stress mechanisms just before low tide, and cardiac responses during a thermal ramp. Both air exposure and stochasticity of temperature change were important in determining thermal performance. Glycogen content was highest in the mussels from the unpredictable treatment, but there was no difference in the expression of heat shock proteins between thermal treatments, suggesting that mussels prioritise energy reserves to deal with unpredictable low tide conditions. Mussels exposed to fluctuating thermal regimes had lower gill anaerobic metabolism, which could reflect increased metabolic capacity. Our results suggest that although thermal magnitude plays an important role in shaping physiological performance, other key elements of the intertidal environment complexity such as stochasticity, thermal variability and thermal history are also important considerations for determining how species will respond to climate warming.",,,,,,"Todgham, Anne/0000-0003-1439-6985",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUL,2022,225,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,35749162,,,,,WOS:000834580400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

AMF inoculation is used to increase plant productivity, including in horticulture, and AMF are introduced into commercial peat-based substrates. Little is known, however, about long-term persistence of AMF in these substrates, especially if presuming adverse storage conditions. The study tested long-term infectivity of AMF introduced to a peat-based substrate stored in five different temperature regimes (constant temperatures of -20, 5 or 20 degrees C) and two outdoor regimes simulating actual practice (shade and direct sunlight). Eight AMF inocula were tested, including monocultures of Claroideoglomus claroideum, Funneliformis caledonium, and F. mosseae plus two isolates of Rhizophagus irregularis, all applied as 4% (v) of the substrate, or their mixture in 1%, 4% and 8% (v) doses. Their infectivity was monitored for 56 weeks at 8-week intervals as measured by mycorrhizal root colonization of bioassay plants. In general, infectivity significantly decreased with time, but in three regimes including periods of cold (5 degrees C, shade and sunlight), cold stratification probably broke spore dormancy and led to temporal stimulation of AMF infectivity. Except for storage at 5 degrees C, where a wider AMF spectrum maintained sufficient long-term viability, infectivity became very low after 1 year. Temperature fluctuations in direct sunlight were less negative than expected, whereas infectivity decline was surprisingly strong also in mild storage conditions (20 degrees C). Higher inoculum dose lengthened AMF infectivity. R. irregularis isolates were found most resistant among the tested AMF. We ascribe the general decline of infectivity to unfavorable properties inherent to peat.",,,,,"Smilauer, Petr/D-7277-2016; Püschel, David/G-3085-2014; Kolaříková, Zuzana/C-3558-2009","Smilauer, Petr/0000-0003-3065-5721; Püschel, David/0000-0002-1949-3242; Kolarikova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3693-2657",,,,,,,,,,,,,0929-1393,1873-0272,,,,AUG,2019,140,,,,,,98,107,,10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.04.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.04.020,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000466929200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Leaf temperature monitoring has the advantages of convenience, reduced damage to the plant without contact, and a larger measurement area. Stomatal conductance to water vapor estimation models, based on leaf temperature, have been proposed in agricultural studies in recent years. However, observations for verification of these models are still lacking, which has limited the application of these models. We performed a drought stress experiment on three typical psammophytes: Artemisia ordosica, Salix psammophila, and Caragana korshinskii. We monitored their leaf temperature and built two leaf temperature-based models to test whether the models could accurately estimate stomatal conductance. Results verified that neither of the two models accurately quantified psammophytes' stomatal conductance in field operations. We further tested the differences among plants and identified that the differences in stomatal mechanism and physical morphology of the leaves drives leaf temperature differences, which affects the accuracy of stomatal conductance estimation using the models. We concluded that more precise measurements of leaf temperature-related parameters, such as wind speed and leaf physical morphology, are needed to improve the models' estimation accuracy.

Plant water status, expressed in terms of the water potential index (WPI), growth in leaf area and dry weight, seed yield and yield components, flowering and seed quality parameters were measured throughout the growing seasons. The adopted irrigation schemes produced a clear differentiation among treatments concerning their plant water status. Seed yield and leaf growth showed close positive correlations with WPI. An irrigation effect was also detected for the number of pods/plant, but not for the average weight of seeds/pod. Less negative values of WPI, and, especially, higher temperatures during flowering were also positively associated with a longer duration of flowering, as well as with higher total numbers of inflorescences. A very good description of the time course of seed germination was performed by fitting the Richards' function to the real data. By examining the germination parameters derived from this function it was found that final germination and germination rate were improved, while germination duration was shortened with more negative values of WPI. The effects of growing season and seeding period were occasionally equally or more important than irrigation effects.

A typical seasonal (or monthly) fluctuation of intertidal MPB PP was found in association with biotic (benthic Chl-a) and/or abiotic parameters (irradiance and temperature) over a period of three years. From a series of field -laboratory experiments using the oxygen micro -profiling method (totaling 28 surveys), three consistent phenomena were observed: 1) winter to early spring algal blooms, 2) seasonal changes in Q(10), and 3) temperature dependent MPB photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I). In particular, both the chlorophyll-specific maximum photosynthetic capacity (P-ma(b).) and the saturated light intensity (I-k), derived from 126 P-I curves (1870 data sets of oxygen micro-profiling in the sediment), were significantly correlated with sediment temperature (p < 0.01). To develop an empirical MPB PP model, the relationships between P-I parameters and environmental variables were parameterized following established exponential forms (e.g., Q(10)). It was possible to estimate the MPB PP in Daebu mudflat area by using easily accessible explanatory factor, suitable to be used for future explorations of parameters such as sediment temperature, irradiance, chlorophyll concentration, and tidal height. The estimated annual MPB PP based on the empirical PP model were found to be greater than that in the Wadden Sea and average annual PP in the temperate zones of the world.

However, it is unknown if temperature fluctuations that ecosystems naturally experience can alter the predicted impacts of warming. We address this uncertainty by exposing a natural marine plankton community to warming conditions (+3?C) under a constant vs. fluctuating (?3?C) temperature regime using an experimental mesocosm approach. We evaluated changes in stoichiometry, biomass, nutrient uptake, taxonomic composition, species richness and diversity, photosynthetic performance, and community metabolic balance. Overall, warming had a stronger impact than fluctuating temperature on all biological organization levels considered. As the ecological succession progressed toward post-bloom, the effects of warming on phytoplankton biomass, species richness, and net community productivity intensified, likely due to a stimulated microzooplankton grazing, and the community metabolic balance shifted toward a CO2 source. However, fluctuating temperatures reduced the negative effects of warming on photosynthetic performance and net community productivity by 40%. Our results demonstrate that temperature fluctuations may temper the negative effect of warming on marine net productivity. These findings highlight the need to consider short-term thermal fluctuations in experimental and modeling approaches because the use of constant warming conditions could lead to an overestimation of the real magnitude of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems.",,,,,"Cabrerizo, Marco J./O-4677-2019","Cabrerizo, Marco J./0000-0001-5576-6095; Fernandez-Gonzalez, Cristina/0000-0001-5197-5519; Alonso-Nunez, Adrian/0000-0002-3488-9173",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,APR 9,2021,8,,,,,,,,,10.3389/fmars.2021.656282,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.656282,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000640437800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We predicted that voles exposed to transient low temperatures would elevate their food intake until they reached some alimentary limit and thereafter they would withdraw reserves. During short-term (24-h) exposure to temperatures below the lower critical temperature (25 degrees C) daily food intake actually decreased significantly to a minimum of 1.51 +/- 0.41 g at 10 degrees C but was greater at 5 degrees and -5 degrees C. Weight loss (g) increased significantly with decreasing temperature; however at -5 degrees C vole mass increased. During more prolonged exposure for 4 d, food intake increased significantly with the duration of cold exposure (5 degrees and 15 degrees C) to a maximum on days 3 and 4. In a separate experiment voles were randomly exposed for 3-d intervals to a range of temperatures from 20 degrees to 5 degrees C and were returned to 25 degrees C for 3 d between exposures. Both food intake and weight loss increased significantly with decreasing temperature; voles gained mass at 20 degrees and 25 degrees C. There was 40% mortality in voles exposed to -5 degrees C for 24 h (n = 10). When voles were exposed to 5 degrees C for 6 d before they were exposed to -5 degrees C, there was zero mortality at -5 degrees C for 12 d (n = 6). The basal metabolism (BMR) of voles before transient cold exposure, 1.71 +/- 0.41 mL . min(-1), was not significantly different from that of the same voles after transient cold exposure (2.17 +/- 0.71 mL . min(-1)). Maximum food intake at 5 degrees C (5.67 +/- 1.45 g . d(-1)) represented 1.7 times BMR, which is considerably lower than the limit on alimentary uptake of seven times BMR previously suggested. Our results suggest that the voles were using a strategy of energy minimization during transient cold exposure that combined increased energy intake with body reserve utilization. However, the duration of cold exposure had a profound effect on this strategy. The mortality data in this species at low temperatures combined with levels of food intake relative to BMR suggest that sustainable metabolic rate is not limited by constraints imposed centrally by the alimentary system but rather by constraints at the sites of energy utilization.",,,,,"Speakman, John R./A-9494-2008","Speakman, John R./0000-0002-2457-1823",,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-935X,,,,,SEP-OCT,1994,67,5,,,,,1103,1116,,10.1086/physzool.67.5.30163884,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/physzool.67.5.30163884,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PR10700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recruitment was simulated at 57 locations throughout the CD with a daily, multilayer soil water model (SOILWAT) that was parameterized and tested to develop recruitment parameters for E. lehmanniana using long-term data from research stations in the SD and CD. Logistic regression was used to predict recruitment across the CD using climate and soil factors to create a map of simulated recruitment under current and alternative climate scenarios. Simulated recruitment under current climate was low for most of the CD. However, localized areas with high probabilities (>0.8) occurred along the western transition between the CD and the SD, and in the southern extent of the CD. In general, the CD climate is too cool and dry for rapid and widespread invasion. However, increases to temperature and precipitation are likely to increase recruitment success.

The resulting biochar properties were measured, which included the yield, specific surface area (SSA), pH, EC (electricity conductivity), the bulk and surface elemental composition, and the contents of moisture, ash, fixed carbon, and volatile matter. The results showed that the pyrolysis temperature was more determinant for the modification of all biochar, but the residence time had a significant effect on the yield, pH, and SSA of branch-based biochar (B-biochar) at specific temperatures. However, such a phenomenon only happened on the pH of leaf-based biochar (L-biochar). Results: (1) With the temperature at 350 and 650 degrees C, the residence time had a significant effect on the yield of B-biochar. (2) The pH of B-biochar and L-biochar varied considerably between durations when the heating temperature hit 650 and 750 degrees C.

According to the properties measured above, the principal component and the cluster analysis classified the 24 types of biochar made in this experiment into four groups and revealed that an obvious disparity existed between B-biochar and L-biochar that were pyrolyzed at temperatures ranging from 450 to 750 degrees C, which suggested that biomass type was the primary factor for biochar-making.

Little consideration has been given to the effects of fluctuating water temperatures and dietary protein levels on the morphology of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of abalone. Because these factors are known to impact growth in other aquatic species, it is important that they are investigated further to improve growth in abalone species. In this study, the histological changes of the GIT of greenlip abalone in response to 2 water temperatures and 4 dietary levels of crude protein (juvenile, 27% and 36%; subadult, 24% and 33%) for juveniles (1.75 g) and subadults (22.93 g) were investigated. The epithelial thickness of the stomach and crop; intestinal villus height, width, and area; lamina propria height; and stomach, crop, and intestinal neutral and acidic goblet cell numbers were measured. The stomach epithelium was significantly thicker at 14 degrees C than 22 degrees C in both juveniles and subadults, whereas the crop epithelium was significantly thicker at 22 degrees C than 14 degrees C in juveniles. The crop epithelial thickness of subadults was reduced by increasing dietary protein; however, juveniles did not show the same response. Juvenile abalone were more sensitive to temperature fluctuations than subadults, whereas significant effects of dietary protein levels were only observed in subadults. The alterations in the morphology of the GIT did not appear to be detrimental to the health and growth of the abalone. Further research is required to investigate the interactive effects of water temperature and dietary ingredients, particularly in regard to antinutritional factors, on the morphology and function of the GIT to improve our understanding of abalone physiology.",,,,,"Howarth, Gordon/AAM-8699-2020; Harris, James/C-8653-2009","Howarth, Gordon/0000-0001-6979-6084; Harris, James/0000-0002-0997-3015",,,,,,,,,,,,,0730-8000,1943-6319,,,,APR,2013,32,1,,,,,131,141,,10.2983/035.032.0119,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.032.0119,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000331514500019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The role of diurnally alternating temperatures (Delta T) in terminating dormancy will be a major factor in this disruption, as its effects on seed germination are immediate. Methods The effect of Delta T on seed germination was modelled using two populations of the wetland sedge Carex diandra, one from a montane site and one from a subalpine site. A cardinal-temperature model was fitted to germination results obtained from a thermal gradient plate, and the model was used to simulate changes in germination under two possible future climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, for representative concentration pathways) as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Key Results Scenario RCP2.6 projected moderate increases in average temperatures and Delta T, whereas RCP8.5 projected greater warming and higher Delta T. Increasing Delta T decreased the base temperature for seed germination and the thermal time required for germination. The effect of higher Delta T together with the higher temperatures increased germination under both climate scenarios. Conclusions Carex diandra germination is highly responsive to potential changes in Delta T, and thus this study highlights the role of Delta T in seed responses to climate change. Comprehensive cardinal-temperature models, encompassing the different effects of temperature on seed germination, are needed to understand how climate change will affect plant regeneration.",,,,,"Fernández-Pascual, Eduardo/AAQ-6315-2020; Fernández-Pascual, Eduardo/A-4387-2013; Seal, Charlotte/E-5495-2017","Fernández-Pascual, Eduardo/0000-0002-4743-9577; Fernández-Pascual, Eduardo/0000-0002-4743-9577; Seal, Charlotte/0000-0002-9329-9325",,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,FEB,2015,115,2,,,,,201,209,,10.1093/aob/mcu234,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcu234,,,,,,,,25564469,,,,,WOS:000349561700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, a study was conducted to assess the effect of altered ambient temperature through shelter modifications on physiological indicators of Malpura lambs reared in the semi -arid region during winter. Twenty-one Malpura lambs of 3-5 week age and average body weight 9.97 0.51 kg were used in the present study. The lambs were divided into three groups (eg. Gl, G2, and G3) and were kept in the different microenvironment by manipulation of shelter design. The G1 lambs were maintained at lower minimum temperature (8.59 0.71 C) in asbestos roofed shed, while G2 lambs were maintained at higher minimum temperature (14.59 0.54 C) in local handmade bamboo dome structure, and G3 lambs were kept at a medium minimum temperature (11.84 0.64 C) in thermocol insulated roofed shed from evening 18:30 h to morning 07:00 h. The study was carried out for one month between January and February. The parameters studied were physiological response (respiration rate, pulse rate, rectal temperature), skin temperature, blood metabolites and endocrine profile. The data were analyzed by general linear models. Higher average daily weight gain was recorded in the lambs kept in higher minimum temperature groups (20.54% higher in G2 and 24.68% higher in G3) as compared to G1 lambs. Microenvironment manipulation had no significant (P > 0.05) effect on most of the physiological response and skin temperature except morning respiration rate within low -temperature range. The present study reveals that Hb, PCV, T3, and cortisol level were significantly (P < 0.05) influenced by microenvironment manipulation.

One ecologically relevant approach consists of examining the thermal responses of a large number of traits, both related with population dynamics and trophic interactions (i.e. a multi-trait approach). Based on in situ climatic data and projections from climate models, we here designed two daily fluctuating thermal regimes realistically reflecting current and future conditions in Eastern France. These models detected an increase in mean temperature and in the range of daily thermal fluctuations as two local facets of global warming likely to occur in our study area by the end of this century. We then examined the responses of several fitness-related traits in caterpillars of the moth Lobesia botrana - including development, pupal mass, survival rates, energetic reserves, behavioral and immune traits expressed against parasitoids - to this experimental imitation of global warming. Increasing temperatures positively affected development (leading to a 31% reduction in the time needed to complete larval stage), survival rates (+19%), and movement speed as a surrogate for larval escape ability to natural enemies ( + 60%). Conversely, warming elicited detrimental effects on lipid reserves ( - 26%) and immunity (total phenoloxidase activity: - 34%). These findings confirm that traits should differ in their sensitivity to global warming, underlying complex consequences for population dynamics and trophic interactions.

J,"Alonso, L; Renard, F",,,,"Alonso, Lucille; Renard, Florent",,,A New Approach for Understanding Urban Microclimate by Integrating Complementary Predictors at Different Scales in Regression and Machine Learning Models,REMOTE SENSING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Climate change is a major contemporary phenomenon with multiple consequences. In urban areas, it exacerbates the urban heat island phenomenon. It impacts the health of the inhabitants and the sensation of thermal discomfort felt in urban areas. Thus, it is necessary to estimate as well as possible the air temperature at any point of a territory, in particular in view of the ongoing rationalization of the network of fixed meteorological stations of Meteo-France. Understanding the air temperature is increasingly in demand to input quantitative models related to a wide range of fields, such as hydrology, ecology, or climate change studies. This study thus proposes to model air temperature, measured during four mobile campaigns carried out during the summer months, between 2016 and 2019, in Lyon (France), in clear sky weather, using regression models based on 33 explanatory variables from traditionally used data, data from remote sensing by LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), or Landsat 8 satellite acquisition. Three types of statistical regression were experimented: partial least square regression, multiple linear regression, and a machine learning method, the random forest regression. For example, for the day of 30 August 2016, multiple linear regression explained 89% of the variance for the study days, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 0.23 degrees C. Variables such as surface temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have a strong impact on the estimation model. This study contributes to the emergence of urban cooling systems. The solutions available vary. For example, they may include increasing the proportion of vegetation on the ground, facades, or roofs, increasing the number of basins and water bodies to promote urban cooling, choosing water-retaining materials, humidifying the pavement, increasing the number of public fountains and foggers, or creating shade with stretched canvas.",,,,,,"Alonso, Lucille/0000-0002-4910-2732; Renard, Florent/0000-0003-1942-8819",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2072-4292,,,,AUG,2020,12,15,,,,,,,2434,10.3390/rs12152434,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12152434,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000559113500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, what are the dynamics when the snow-free summer growth season coincides with a 6-month seasonal drought? We tested this fundamental question by measuring tree growth and leaf activity across elevations in Mt Hermon (2814 m; in Israel and Syria), where oak trees (Quercus look and Quercus boissieri) form an observed treeline at 1900 m. While in theory, individuals can be established at higher elevations (minimum daily temperature >6.5 degrees C for >4 months even at the summit), soil drying and vapor pressure deficit in summer enforces growth cessation in August, leaving only 2-3 months for tree growth. At lower elevations, Q. look Kotschy is replaced by Quercus cerris L. (1300 m) and Quercus calliprinos Webb (1000 m) in accompanying Q. boissieri Reut., and growth season length (GSL) is longer due to an earlier start in April. Leaf gas exchange continues during autumn, but assimilates are no longer utilized in growth. Interestingly, the growth and activity of Q. boissieri were equivalent to that of each of the other three species across the similar to 1 km elevation gradient. A planting experiment at 2100 m showed that seedlings of the four oak species survived the cold winter and showed budding of leaves in summer, but wilted in August. Our unique mountain site in the Eastern Mediterranean introduces a new factor to the formation of treelines, involving a drought limitation on GSL. This site presents the elevation edge for each species and the southern distribution edge for both the endemic Q. look and the broad-range Q. cerris. With ongoing warming, Q. look and Q. boissieri are slowly expanding to higher elevations, while Q. cerris is at risk of future extirpation.",,,,,,"Kopler, Idan/0000-0001-5855-707X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,SEP 8,2022,42,9,,,,,1700,1719,,10.1093/treephys/tpac070,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpac070,,JUN 2022,,,,,,35738872,,,,,WOS:000843389600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

(Diptera: Culicidae) towards temperate regions in the Americas is causing concern because of its public health implications. As for other insects, the distribution limits of Ae. aegypti have been suggested to be related to minimum temperatures and to be controlled mainly by cold tolerance. The aim of this study was to assess the daily mortality of immature stages of Ae. aegypti under natural winter conditions in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in relation to preceding thermal conditions. The experiment was performed outdoors, and one cohort of larvae was started each week for 16 weeks, and reared up to the emergence of the adults. Three times a week, larvae, pupae and emerged adults were counted, and these data were used to calculate the daily mortality of larvae, pupae and adults and to analyze their relationship with thermal conditions. The results showed that mortality was generally low, with a few peaks of high mortality after cold front events. The mortality of pupae and larvae showed a higher correlation with the cooling degree hours of previous days than with the minimum, maximum or mean temperatures. Pupae and adults showed to be more vulnerable to low temperatures than larvae. A delay in mortality was observed in relation to the low temperature events, with a proportion of individuals dying in a later stage after the end of the cold front. These results suggest that thermal conditions during cold fronts in Buenos Aires are close to the tolerance limit of the local Ae. aegypti population. The wide range of responses of different individuals suggests that low winter temperatures may constitute a selective force, leading the population to a higher tolerance to low temperatures, which might favor the further expansion of this species towards colder regions.",,,,,"Fischer, Sylvia/AAB-6125-2020","Fischer, Sylvia/0000-0002-1184-0414; Montini, Pedro/0000-0003-1631-084X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4565,1879-0992,,,,JAN,2021,95,,,,,,,,102808,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102808,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102808,,,,,,,,33454038,,,,,WOS:000609163700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We downscaled temperatures for the Fraser River, British Columbia to evaluate the impact of climate warming on the frequency of exceeding thermal thresholds associated with salmon migratory success. Alarmingly, a modest 1.0 degrees C increase in average summer water temperature over 100 years (1981-2000 to 2081-2100) tripled the number of days per year exceeding critical salmonid thermal thresholds (i.e. 19.0 degrees C). Refined thresholds for two populations (Gates Creek and Weaver Creek) of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were defined using physiological constraint models based on aerobic scope. While extreme temperatures leading to complete aerobic collapse remained unlikely under our warming scenario, both populations were increasingly forced to migrate upriver at reduced levels of aerobic performance (e.g. in 80% of future simulations, >= 90% of salmon encountered temperatures exceeding population-specific thermal optima for maximum aerobic scope; T-opt=16.3 degrees C for Gates Creek and T-opt=14.5 degrees C for Weaver Creek). Assuming recent changes to river entry timing persist, we also predicted dramatic increases in the probability of freshwater mortality for Weaver Creek salmon due to reductions in aerobic, and general physiological, performance (e.g. in 42% of future simulations >= 50% of Weaver Creek fish exceeded temperature thresholds associated with 0-60% of maximum aerobic scope). Potential for adaptation via directional selection on run-timing was more evident for the Weaver Creek population. Early entry Weaver Creek fish experienced 25% (range: 15-31%) more suboptimal temperatures than late entrants, compared with an 8% difference (range: 0-17%) between early and late Gates Creek fish.

Their development times were fitted to the linear degree-day model and three nonlinear models (DEVAR, Lactin, and Rueda). Parameter values and 95% CL were estimated. The lower development threshold is estimated to be 15 degrees C (linear DEVAR model) and 17.5 degrees C (Lactin model), and the temperature resulting in the shortest development time is estimated to be between 26 degrees C (Lactin model) and 37 degrees C (nonlinear DEVAR model). The thermal death point by the Lactin model is 34.4 degrees C, and conforms well with other studies. Differences between the present results and those of other studies for T. guasayana are discussed in terms of the maternal effects, the influence of experimental conditions, and the rate summation effect.

However, there has been limited research into avian thermoregulation during migration in extreme environments. This study aimed to investigate the effect of flight performance and high altitude on body temperature (T-b) of free-flying bar-headed geese (Anser indicus), a species that completes a high-altitude trans-Himalayan migration through very cold, hypoxic environments. We measured abdominal T-b, along with altitude (via changes in barometric pressure), heart rate and body acceleration of bar-headed geese during their migration across the Tibetan Plateau. Bar-headed geese vary the circadian rhythm of T-b in response to migration, with peak daily T-b during daytime hours outside of migration but early in the morning or overnight during migration, reflecting changes in body acceleration. However, during flight, changes in T-b were not consistent with changes in flight performance (as measured by heart rate or rate of ascent) or altitude. Overall, our results suggest that bar-headed geese are able to thermoregulate during high-altitude migration, maintaining T-b within a relatively narrow range despite appreciable variation in flight intensity and environmental conditions.",,,,,"Batbayar, Nyambayar/N-7066-2015; Hawkes, Lucy/L-7407-2014","Batbayar, Nyambayar/0000-0002-9138-9626; Parr, Nicole/0000-0001-6115-6816; Hawkes, Lucy/0000-0002-6696-1862",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,OCT,2019,222,19,,,,,,,jeb203695,10.1242/jeb.203695,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.203695,,,,,,,,31601684,,,,,WOS:000490244400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, studies focusing on the measurement of physiological traits are usually performed under constant temperature regimes. This mismatch between thermal exposure in the field and experimental conditions could act as a stressor agent, as physiological functions are strongly influenced by temperature. Herein, we asked the question whether constant thermal regimes would cause a stress response and impact the immunity of the South American rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus) when compared with a fluctuating thermal regime. We addressed this question by determining heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratio, plasma bacteria-killing ability (BKA) and corticosterone (CORT) levels in snakes kept under a constant temperature regime at 30 degrees C, and under a fluctuating regime that oscillated between 25 degrees C at night and 35 degrees C during the day. The experiments had a mirrored design, in which half of the snakes were subjected to a fluctuating-to-constant treatment, while the other half was exposed to a constant-to-fluctuating treatment. The shift from constant to fluctuating thermal regime was accompanied by an increase in plasma CORT levels, indicating the activation of a stress response. Exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime at the onset of the experiments induced a decrease in the BKA of rattlesnakes. H:L ratio was not affected by treatments and, therefore, the shift between thermal regimes seems to have acted as a low-intensity stressor. Our results suggest that removal from temperatures close to the snake's preferred body temperature triggers a stress response in rattlesnakes.",,,,,"Madelaire, Carla/ABI-4033-2020; Andrade, Denis/A-9145-2013","Gomes, Fernando/0000-0003-2244-6161; Bonetti Madelaire, Carla/0000-0002-4399-715X; Fabricio Neto, Ailton/0000-0002-9072-0401; Andrade, Denis/0000-0002-7662-2848",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,NOV,2019,222,22,,,,,,,jeb208645,10.1242/jeb.208645,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.208645,,,,,,,,31672725,,,,,WOS:000499647100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the occurrence of ENSO will affect the redistribution of precipitation and the temperature (T) spatial pattern on a global scale. This condition will further lead to flood or drought disasters in Southeast China. Therefore, the method of monitoring the occurrence of ENSO is important and is the focus of this paper. The spatiotemporal characteristics of precipitable water vapor (PWV) and T are first analyzed during ENSO using the empirical orthogonal function (EOF). The results showed that a high correlation spatiotemporal consistency exist between PWV and T. The response thresholds of PWV and T to ENSO are determined by moving the window correlation analysis (MWCA). If the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) at the Nino 3.4 region exceeded the ranges of (-1.17 degrees C, 1.04 degrees C) and (-1.15 degrees C, 1.09 degrees C), it could cause the anomalous change of PWV and T in Southeast China. Multichannel singular spectral analysis (MSSA) is introduced to analyze the multi-type signals (tendency, period, and anomaly) of PWV and T over the period of 1979-2017. The results showed that the annual abnormal signal and envelope line fluctuation of PWV and T agreed well in most cases with the change in SSTA. Therefore, a standard PWV and T index (SPTI) is proposed on the basis of the results to monitor ENSO events. The PWV and T data derived from the grid-based European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) reanalysis products and GNSS/RS stations in Southeast China were used to validate the performance of the proposed SPTI. Experimental results revealed that the time series of average SPTI calculated in Southeast China corresponded well to that of SSTA with a correlation coefficient of 0.66 over the period of 1979-2017. The PWV values derived from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and radiosonde data at two specific stations (WUHN and 45004) were also used to calculate the SPTI. The results showed that the correlation coefficients between SPTI and SSTA were 0.73 and 0.71, respectively.

The offspring were cultivated at 1.5-2-degrees-C to naupliar stage III-VI, and then separated into three different temperature regimes almost-equal-to 40 days after hatching. A significant difference in abundance and stage composition in the three different experimental series evolved within 6 days after differentiation in temperatures, and greater similarities were found for those series which experienced a temperature increase. The stage composition of C. finmarchicus in the three different series was equal at the start of the experiments with the dominance of nauplius stage IV (NIV). In one series, with a constant temperature increase of 0.2-degrees-C day-1, the populations gradually changed into copepodites and a small proportion appeared as copepodite stage IV (CIV) in the period 18-24 days after incubation. At a lower rate of temperature increase (i.e., 0.1-degrees-C day-1) CIV did not appear in the populations, and only three copepodite stage II (CII) and one copepodite stage III (CIII) were found at the end of the experiment. In a third series at a constant temperature of 2-degrees-C population abundance decreased constantly throughout the experimental period, and only a low proportion of the population appeared as copepodite stage I (CI) at Day 18. A tendency for arrested development was observed since CI was not present in the populations at Day 24. The present experiments demonstrate that C. finmarchicus is dependent on a certain temperature increase for successful stage development at low temperatures. However, the results differ from earlier experiments conducted in 1980 on the same species from the same region, since the naupliar developmental rates at 2-degrees-C obtained in 1980 were definitely higher than those obtained in 1989. The overwintering temperature, which female C. finmarchicus experienced, differed markedly between 1980 and 1989. This indicates that different overwintering temperatures experienced by adults could shift the low temperature tolerance of the offspring. The formulated hypothesis for ontogenetic differences in the physiological response to temperature in C. finmarchicus (Tande, 1988) must also be considered in relation to the possibility that the maternal acclimation to the overwintering temperature could modify the rate-temperature response in the offspring later in the spring. This means that caution should be applied when adopting the commonly used empirical temperature functions for estimating stage durations of copepods in high-latitude environments until the possible effect of acclimation has been ruled out in quantitative terms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,,1992,155,2,,,,,183,197,,10.1016/0022-0981(92)90062-F,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(92)90062-F,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992HL11600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Preoviposition period of fertilized and virgin females varied with temperature from ca. 9 days at 17.5A degrees C to ca. 1.5 day at 32.5A degrees C and then increased to ca. 3 days at 35A degrees C. Virgin female oviposition period was significantly shorter than for fertilized females at the temperatures examined with the exception of 17.5A degrees C. The mean total number of eggs per fertilized (169.7 +/- A 6.6) and virgin female (60.7 +/- A 4.3) was highest at the temperature of 30A degrees C. The data indicated a significant positive and nearly doubling effect of fertilization on female fecundity at the temperatures examined with the exception of 17.5A degrees C.

Increasing numbers of producers are opting to use calf jackets as a means of mitigating the potential negative effects of low ambient temperatures, wind speed and precipitation on growth and health. This study aimed to use a range of noninvasive monitoring technologies to investigate the effects of using calf jackets in the first 3 weeks of life on calf performance and behavioural and physiological parameters. Ninety Holstein-Friesian calves were allocated to one of the two treatments: (i) Jacketed until 21 days of age and (J; n = 44) ii. Nonjacketed (NJ; n = 46). Calves were group housed and fed milk replacer (MR) and concentrate solid feed via automatic feeders. Calves were weaned at day 56, and the experiment was completed at day 63. Health assessments were conducted on a daily basis throughout the experiment using predefined faecal and respiratory scoring protocols. A range of novel, noninvasive monitoring technologies were used to examine the activity, heart rate and thermal profiles of calves on an individual basis throughout the experimental period. There were no differences in calf live weight (LWT), average daily gain (ADG) or feed conversion efficiency (FCE) in J and NJ calves between days 5 to 20. However, NJ calves consumed more MR and had more unrewarded visits to the milk feeder than J calves during this period. Although calf LWT was comparable across treatments in the week following jacket removal (days 21 to 28), both ADG and FCE tended to be greater in NJ calves. There were no treatment differences in calf LWT at the end of the study (d63). When measured over a period of 24 h and at a mean ambient temperature of 7.7 degrees C, skin surface temperature was 6.37 degrees C higher in J calves. Core body temperature was higher in J calves between days 5 to 20; however, there were no differences in IR eye or IR rectal temperature. No differences in lying behaviour occurred, with calves spending 18 and 17 h/day lying between days 5 to 20 and days 21 to 28, respectively.

Despite the importance of Arctodiaptomus salinus in these systems, little is known about the effect of temperature on its population dynamics. Through an individual-based experimental protocol, we studied the effect of this factor and food on its reproduction. This approach has revealed a large range of variability in reproductive parameters in all the experimental conditions. Temperature positively affected egg production and negatively longevity, but did not affect clutch size. Under unsuitable food conditions, the clutch size decreased and the inter-clutch period increased, and when the food conditions improved, the number of eggs increased gradually in every clutch. Eggs from the same clutch hatched synchronously. In contrast, there were significant differences between the hatching times of clutches from different females and between those of the same female. The observed individual variability increased when temperature moved away from the medium values. The thermal tolerance threshold for A. salinus development might be around 25-29A degrees C. Since water pond is close to this thermal limit for long periods of time, an increment of temperature because of global warming might have dramatic consequences on this population.

Shifts in environmental conditions-and the resulting effects on growth-are of particular concern for high latitude species, which are experiencing more pronounced impacts of climate change. We measured effects of temperature on growth, consumption, and respiration of young-of-year (YOY) Sablefish (218-289 mm TL; Anoplopoma fimbria) in laboratory trials. Physiological response functions were used to outfit a novel, life stage specific bioenergetics model. Average daily growth rates ranged from 0.82 to 3.42 g(-1) (46.7 to 122 J g(-1) d(-1)), with optimum growth occurring at 12-16 degrees C and declining substantially outside of this range. We then validated the model by comparing model estimates of growth to known growth rates for a separate cohort of Sablefish reared under controlled conditions. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the consumption-related parameters had the greatest influence on model outputs. As such, consumption parameters should be determined with care. Finally, we used the model to characterize the conditions necessary for wild YOY Sablefish to successfully settle from neustonic to demersal stages by modeling temperature-prey scenarios that reflect the transition from neustonic offshore to demersal nearshore habitats observed over the period from August to October. Our findings suggest that Sablefish in the Gulf of Alaska could thrive under warming ocean conditions given sufficient food, which corroborates reports of high Sablefish recruitment events following a marine heat wave in 2014.",,,,,,"Krieger, Joseph/0000-0002-1524-0088",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,MAY,2020,526,,,,,,,,151340,10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151340,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151340,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000528044300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used field sampling and laboratory experiments to explore the mechanisms underlying first winter growth and Survival of white crappie Pomoxis annularis, which exhibits variable recruitment. We sampled age-0 white crappies from four Ohio reservoirs before winter to evaluate whether large individuals had a greater energy density (kJ/g) than small ones and whether mean energy density differed among reservoirs. Energy density increased with fish size in all reservoirs, suggesting that small fish Could die earlier if energy stores become limiting during winter. Mean energy density varied among reservoirs Lis well, Suggesting that prewinter energy reserves Could influence recruitment variability across reservoirs through their effects on winter starvation. Our laboratory experiment evaluated how fish size (small or large), feeding level (starved or fed). and winter severity (mild or severe) interact to influence the growth and survival of age-0 white crappies. The two winter severity treatments represented two extremes for Ohio winters (i.e., mild and severe). We calculated daily individual growth rates for all fish, energy density for a Subset of fish, and percent survival across treatments. Winter severity strongly influenced Survival: only 47% of all white crappies survived the severe winter, whereas 97% Survived the mild winter. In the severe winter, neither size nor feeding level influenced mortality. Bomb calorimetry revealed energy density to be similar among fish that died and those that Survived the severe winter, suggesting that energy depletion did not cause mortality. Rather, osmoregulatory failure may have occurred during exposure to temperatures colder than 4degreesC for at least I week. Thus. the availability of warm (greater than or equal to4degreesC), oxygenated water during winter may be critical to the Survival of age-0 white crappies.

Knowledge of the temperature response of leaf extension, particularly variations close to the thermal limit of growth, helps define physiological growth constraints and breeding-related genotypic differences among cultivars. Here, we present a novel method, called 'Leaf Length Tracker' (LLT), suitable for measuring leaf elongation rates (LERs) of cereals and other grasses with high precision and high temporal resolution under field conditions. The method is based on image sequence analysis, using a marker tracking approach to calculate LERs. We applied the LLT to several varieties of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), summer barley (Hordeum vulgare), and ryegrass (Lolium perenne), grown in the field and in growth cabinets under controlled conditions. LLT is easy to use and we demonstrate its reliability and precision under changing weather conditions that include temperature, wind, and rain. We found that leaf growth stopped at a base temperature of 0 degrees C for all studied species and we detected significant genotype-specific differences in LER with rising temperature. The data obtained were statistically robust and were reproducible in the tested environments. Using LLT, we were able to detect subtle differences (sub-millimeter) in leaf growth patterns.

In the western north Atlantic Ocean juvenile tarpon occur in estuaries of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) north of Florida near the northern limit of its distribution, but it is currently unknown whether these individuals can survive winter, grow to maturity, and contribute to the adult population. As a first step to determine whether juvenile tarpon can survive winter conditions in the SAB, we conducted laboratory experiments to estimate minimum lethal temperatures of tarpon exposed to 1) ambient fluctuating winter water conditions and 2) a constant rate of temperature decline. Juvenile tarpon exposed to ambient winter water conditions had a mean +/- standard deviation (SD) minimum lethal temperature of 13.7 +/- 3.4 +/- degrees C. When exposed to a constant rate of temperature decline (2 degrees C day(-1)), mean +/- SD minimum lethal temperature (9.2 +/- 0.8 degrees C) was lower than when tarpon were exposed to ambient fluctuating conditions. A combination of our results with all published data on the cold tolerance of juvenile tarpon resulted in an overall mean +/- SD minimum lethal temperature of 12.0 +/- 2.8 degrees C. Based on available long-termtemperature records from SAB estuaries, overwinter survival of juvenile tarpon is unlikely in most aquatic habitats (e.g., tidal creeks, flats, open water).

Flowering branches were exposed to filtered air (control) and to 60 ppb of ozone (ozone) for 3 h in fumigation chambers during spring, autumn, winter and summer. After exposure, they were maintained for 24-120h under filtered air for recovery. A sub-group of each treatment was taken every 24 h, when MCN was scored in inflorescences and the levels of AA were determined in bracts. Ozone caused a significant increase in the frequency of MCN after 24-120 of recovery, compared to measurements in inflorescences from the control treatment, but maximal MCN rate was reached between 72 and 120 h of recovery. The highest percentages of MCN in both fumigation treatments were found during the winter experiment. Ozone exposure did not induce significant changes in the content of AA. However, it was positively influenced by daily amplitude of air temperature during the period of the bioassay. The intensity of genotoxic damage and the time lag necessary to visualize an enhanced number of MCN depended on the levels of ascorbic acid in bracts 24 h before MCN scoring and on the daily amplitude of air temperature during the development of the bioassay. Narrower ranges between daily maximum and minimum temperatures (around 4 degrees C) during the days of experiment seemed to promote a more efficient diagnostic of genotoxiciy induced by ozone.

ESD is thought to be adaptive when seasonal variations in environmental conditions provide a sex-specific fitness advantage. In vertebrates, temperature is the most common determinant of sex, and seasonal variation in temperature serves as a temporal cue of environmental quality such as length of the growing season. Some environments, however, lack strong seasonal temperature fluctuations and other cues, particularly photoperiod, may provide a more reliable indicator of the environment offspring enter. We tested this hypothesis by rearing the offspring of the California grunion (Leuresthes tenuis, Ayres), which experiences low seasonal temperature variation in nature, under common garden conditions at three temperature and two photoperiod treatments. Our experiments revealed that both temperature and photoperiod significantly affected sex ratios in L tenuis. More females were produced at cooler temperatures and longer day lengths, which is consistent with female-biased sex ratios early in the breeding season, and likely adaptive through increased female size and fecundity. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of photoperiod-dependent sex determination in a gonochoristic vertebrate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This speeding up is attributed to a shortening of the correlation time of the frequency fluctuations most probably by preventing water molecules from leaving the protein interior. Superimposed to the frequency fluctuation dynamics is a relaxation dynamics that manifests itself as an aging process in the spectral diffusion broadening. Although the trehalose environment speeds up the fluctuations, it does not have any influence on the relaxation. Both relaxation and fluctuations are governed by power laws in time. The respective exponents do not seem to change with the protein environment. From the spectral dynamics, the mean square displacement in conformation space can be determined.

Here, we report on a review of the effects of four environmental variables (elevated temperature, N and CO2 and reduced moisture) on the capitulum biomass, length increment, respiration, photosynthetic capability, N and P exchange and content of the 3 most studied Sphagnum subgenera (Acutifolia, Cuspidata, Sphagnum). Overall, we observe that, when compared to in situ experiments, laboratory experiments tend to exacerbate length increments and underestimate maximum photosynthesis in most of the studies inventoried. This review underscores some differences among results that can be associated with the used of different protocols (e.g. exposure time, instrumental analysis). Studies that investigated the impact of elevated temperature (2-5 degrees C) on Sphagnum reveal an increase in length, respiration and photosynthesis regardless of the experimental conditions and subgenus. Elevated N (3-23 g Nm(-2)y(-1)) on the other hand appears to reduce the length increment but had contrasting effects on photosynthesis. Some divergent responses are found with Cuspidata species because of their tolerance to high doses of N.

A characteristic feature of the hippocampal region is its expression of different electrical population rhythms and activities during different brain states. Physiological fluctuations in brain temperature affect the activity patterns in hippocampus, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the thermal modulation of hippocampal activity at the cellular network level. Primary cell cultures of mouse E17 hippocampus displayed robust network activation upon light cooling of the extracellular solution from baseline physiological temperatures. The activity generated was dependent on action potential firing and excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Involvement of thermosensitive channels from the transient receptor potential (TRP) family in network activation by temperature changes was ruled out, whereas pharmacological and immunochemical experiments strongly pointed towards the involvement of temperature-sensitive two-pore-domain potassium channels (K-2P), TREK/TRAAK family. In hippocampal slices we could show an increase in evoked and spontaneous synaptic activity produced by mild cooling in the physiological range that was prevented by chloroform, a K-2P channel opener. We propose that cold-induced closure of background TREK/TRAAK family channels increases the excitability of some hippocampal neurons, acting as a temperature-sensitive gate of network activation. Our findings in the hippocampus open the possibility that small temperature variations in the brain in vivo, associated with metabolism or blood flow oscillations, act as a switch mechanism of neuronal activity and determination of firing patterns through regulation of thermosensitive background potassium channel activity.",,,,,"Elvira, De la Pena/O-7380-2015; Viana, Felix/U-8533-2017; Vara Rivera, Hugo/L-4480-2018","Elvira, De la Pena/0000-0001-5961-5067; Viana, Felix/0000-0003-1439-949X; Vara Rivera, Hugo/0000-0002-7287-815X; Caires, Rebeca/0000-0002-5202-6080",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,DEC 31,2012,7,12,,,,,,,e52475,10.1371/journal.pone.0052475,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052475,,,,,,,,23300680,,,,,WOS:000313872600016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Field experiment was carried out in 2020-2021 in Xinjiang, China. The experiment included two topping treatments: chemical topping using heavy amount of mepiquat chloride and traditional manual topping; and two typical row spacing for machine-harvesting: equal row spacing (76 cm) and narrow-wide row spacing (10 cm + 66 cm). Sap flow was measured using a heat ratio method after cotton first flowering stage and then calculated to transpiration per plant and per unit ground area. Chemical topping increased cotton plant height by 12%, leaf area index by 13%, and stem diameter by 9% but did not affect cotton lint yield compared with manual topping across two years and row configurations. The sap velocity of drip-irrigated cotton ranged overall from 20 to 45 cm hr(-1) at the daytime and close to zero at nighttime. Across two years, the daily transpiration in chemical topping after flowering was 5.57 mm d(-1) and 14.8% higher than in manual topping. That in narrow-wide row spacing was higher than in equal rows. However, the water use efficiency did not differ between topping and row spacing treatments, being 5.64 kg m(-3) on average for aboveground dry matter.

The specific host-parasitoid life system used in the evaluation was the boil weevil-Catolaccus grandis system. Four forms of functional response equations were tested: Type I, Type II, a Type II modified to yield constant attack probabilities under constant host:parasitoid ratios, and a temperature-dependent Type II. Simulation runs showed that the parasitoid is potentially capable of considerable suppression of the host population. Predicted host numbers under Type I and II equations did not differ markedly, because realistic host numbers per parasitoid were often found in the linear portion of the Type II equation. The probability of attack using a Type I equation was always near 100% despite arbitrarily increasing the host population to create a wide range of host:parasitoid ratios. The Type II equation resulted in fluctuating attack probabilities which steadily declined as host:parasitoid ratio exceeded 100:1. The modified Type II equation yielded attack probabilities starting at 52% and steadily declining to about 8% when host:parasitoid ratios neared 1000:1. We introduced a realistic, but hypothetical, relationship between functional response and temperature. Simulations using actual weather data from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas suggest that there is little difference between using Types I or II equations, but that the effect of temperature on attack rates is substantial in this system. Caution should be used when incorporating data from experiments into simulation models because experimental conditions are often unrealistically optimal.

Most parents that physically incubate their eggs through direct contact are challenged to balance their time on the nest with taking foraging recesses to satisfy their energetic requirements. To explore the costs and investment strategies of incubating female Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa), we manipulated the nnicroclimate of nests by reducing down insulation from the typical 4.0 g to 0.5 g. Cooling rates of clutches during morning recesses increased when down insulation was reduced, especially at low ambient temperatures. Females with reduced down responded to increased cooling rates by shortening morning recesses and increasing daily incubation constancy, and these behavioral changes were independent of their body mass at the start of incubation. Females in both treatment groups responded similarly to changes in ambient temperature and spent less time incubating as ambient temperatures increased. Clutch temperatures at the end of morning recesses were similar for females with reduced and normal insulation. Average clutch temperatures for the full incubation period did not differ between treatments, and, correspondingly, there were no differences in length of the incubation period, hatching success, or duckling phenotype. Our results show that female Wood Ducks were sensitive to changes in both clutch temperature and ambient temperature and that they modified their time on the nest to provide developing eggs with an optimal thermal environment without negatively affecting their body mass at the end of incubation. Further examination of the limits of behavioral plasticity in incubating birds will be essential, particularly in light of future challenges presented by climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1938-4254,,,,OCT,2014,131,4,,,,,672,680,,10.1642/AUK-14-57.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-14-57.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000344823200018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Minimum values of mean coldest-month temperature (T-c) and 'effective' growing degree days (GDD*) were fitted to species' range limits. GDD* is total annual growing degree days (GDD) minus GDD to budburst (GDD(o)). Each species was assigned to one of the chilling-response categories identified by Murray, Cannell & Smith (1989) to calculate GDD(o).

There was no significant difference in survival between static temperatures and fluctuating temperatures that shared the same mean temperature, yet there was a slight difference in LT50s. Upper thermal tolerance of Apache Trout eyed eggs and alevins is much lower than that of fry to adult life stages (2223 degrees C).

Interactions between Color Change and Heat Avoidance Behavior in Battus philenor Larvae,AMERICAN NATURALIST,,,,,,,,,,,,"Having multiple plastic responses to a change in the environment, such as increased temperature, can be adaptive for two major reasons: synergy (the plastic responses perform better when expressed simultaneously) or complementarity (each plastic response provides a greater net benefit in a different environmental context). We investigated these hypotheses for two forms of temperature-induced plasticity of Battus philenor caterpillars in southern Arizona populations: color change (from black to red at high temperatures) and heat avoidance behavior (movement from host to elevated refuges at high host temperatures). Field assays using aluminum models showed that the cooling effect of the red color is greatly reduced in a refuge position relative to that on a host. Field assays with live caterpillars demonstrated that refuge seeking is much more important for survival under hot conditions than coloration; however, in those assays, red coloration reduced the need to seek refuges. Our results support the complementarity hypothesis: refuge seeking facilitates survival during daily temperature peaks, while color change reduces the need to leave the host over longer warm periods.

The most important ones include: the presence of a honey-bearing base, climatic conditions, temperature of the environment, etc. It significantly affects the growth of families and the stability of the microclimate in the nest. The welcome temperature range in the postembryonic period fluctuates within 30-38 degrees C. Therefore, the purpose of the work was to find out the physiological and biochemical peculiarities of the adaptation of the body of honeybee bees under the influence of the lowered temperature in the nest. For research, two groups of honeybees were selected that differed in terms of maintenance. The control group was constantly in the nest of the bee family, and the experimental at the stage of the prepupa was placed in a thermostat where the temperature was maintained at 32 degrees C. Materials for researches were tissues of prepupa and pupa. The method of thin-layer chromatography identifies the classes of lipids, phospholipids and cholesterol. Based on the performed researches, it was found that the violation of the optimal parameters of the microclimate in the post-embryonal period affects the increase in the weight of the prepupa of the body by 19.4% (P < 0.001) and the decrease in the intensity of the processes of dehydration in tissues by 63.8% (P < 0.05), which is associated with the accumulation of bound water in cells. It is proved that the decrease of the optimum temperature of the incubation of the breeding breed at 2 degrees C leads to prolongation of the post-embryonic development period by 35-42 hours. Under such conditions, throughout the period of incubation in bees, high levels of total lipids are observed. At the stage of prepupa, the number of triacylglycerols in the lipids increases by 49.0% (P < 0.001). In ontogenesis in pupa tissues, a gradual decrease in the content of triacylglycerols, including the imaging stage, is evidently due to the effect of the stress factor. It was found that lowering the temperature on the second day of incubation of the breeding plant reduces the content of phospholipids in the lipid tissues by 11.9% (P < 0.05). At the same time, the decrease in the content of lysophosphatidylcholine was detected by 6.6% (P < 0.001). The violation of the optimum temperature during the development of bees leads to a steady increase in the content of esterified cholesterol by an average of 47.9% (P < 0.01).

Consequently, the energetically demanding period of egg production may coincide with periods of lower food availability, fluctuating temperature and more unstable weather. Little is known about the physiological mechanisms underlying temperature-induced variation in egg production. We therefore examined the influence of low ambient temperature (7 degrees C vs 21 degrees C) on reproductive output (e.g. egg mass, clutch size, laying interval, laying rate), daily food consumption and lipid variables in zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata. When faced with egg production at 7 degrees C, laying zebra finches increased energy intake by 12.67 kJ day(-1), and were thus able to maintain body condition (e.g. body mass, fat and muscle score) and circulating triacylglyceride at levels comparable to those at 21 degrees C. However, when producing eggs at 7 degrees C, females took longer to initiate egg laying (6.5 vs 6.1 days at 21 degrees C), and ultimately laid fewer eggs (5.5 vs 6.0 eggs) at a slower rate (0.90 eggs day(-1) vs 0.95 eggs day(-1)). These temperature-related declines in reproductive output were accompanied by decreases in modal (from 36.6 at 21 degrees C to 24.3 nm at 7 degrees C) and median very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle diameter (from 29.6 to 26.4 nm) and in the proportion of VLDL particles that were capable of passing through the pores in the ovary to access the developing ovarian follicles (i.e. particles with diameters between 25 and 44 nm; from 45.90% to 32.55%). However, variation in reproductive output was not related to any static concentration or structural measure of VLDL.

The interannual variability of AGCM simulated rainfall over South Africa and Namibia (southern Africa) are compared with observations. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analyses revealed a strong correlation between the dominant observed austral summer season (October-March) and mid-summer season (December and January) rainfall patterns over southern Africa and the corresponding model results. It is shown that the AGCM simulated austral summer season rainfall variability in the dominant amplitude time series (first principle component or PCI time series) compare well with SST fluctuations over the equatorial Pacific and tropical western Indian Oceans. Although the associated dominant observed rainfall time series accounts for a larger fraction of the total variability (relative to the AGCM), it also compares well with equatorial Pacific and tropical western Indian Ocean SST fluctuations. To a certain degree these results accentuates the model's ability to capture the major summer seasonal rainfall variability as a response of global SST forcing, which might make the AGCM suitable for future use in seasonal rainfall forecasting research.

However, if there are too many leaves, the lower part of the canopy becomes heavily shaded and yields are reduced. Experiments were conducted to determine if cultivars of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) grown in Queensland, Australia have excessive leaf production for adequate cropping. Seven cultivars and breeding lines were planted from March to May from 2004 to 2016 and the number of fully-expanded leaves, dry weight of the flowers and fruit, and yield/plant recorded (n = 23). Information was collected on daily maximum and minimum temperatures and solar radiation. Increases in the number of leaves/plant over the season followed a linear pattern (range in R-2 from 0.81-0.99), with the relationship generally similar or better than a dose-logistic (sigmoid) function (range in R-2 from 0.79-0.99). There were strong linear relationships between the number of leaves/plant and growing degree-days (GDDs), using a base temperature of 7 degrees C (range in R-2 from 0.81-0.99). In contrast, there was no relationship between the number of leaves/plant produced each day and average season daily mean temperature (15.7 degrees C to 17.8 degrees C) or radiation (13.0 to 15.9 MJ/m(2)/day) (R-2 < 0.10).

There was no relationship between yield and the number of leaves/plant (R-2 < 0.10) because rain before harvest damaged the fruit in some years.

Using the measurements of soil CO2 diffusivity and soil CO2 production, an analytical model was applied to correct the data, aiming to quantify the method-induced error. The results showed that Rm and Rr responded differently to biotic and abiotic factors and exhibited different diurnal and seasonal variations. The diurnal variation of Rm was strongly controlled by soil temperature, while Rr might be mainly controlled by photosynthesis. The combination of soil temperature and moisture could better explain the seasonal variation in Rm (r(2) = 0.76, P < 0.001). The seasonal variation of Rr was influenced mainly by the plant activity. The contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration (Rr/Rt ratio) also exhibited substantial diurnal and seasonal variations, being higher at night-time and lower at daytime. In the different growing stages, the Rr/Rt ratios ranged from 15.0% to 62.0% in 2008 and 14.5% to 63.6% in 2009. The mean values of the Rr/Rt ratio in the growing season and the annual mean Rr/Rt ratio were 41.7% and 41.9%, respectively, during the experiment period. Different precipitation distributions in the two years did not change the yearly Rr/Rt ratio. Corrected with the analytical model, the trenching method in small root-free plots led to an underestimation of Rr and Rr/Rt ratio by 4.2% and 1.8%.

A unique set of coincident surface and subsurface oceanic temperature measurements from CBLAST-Low is used to investigate the subsurface expression of this spatially organized SST variability, and the SST variability is linked to internal waves. The data are used to test two previously hypothesized mechanisms for SST signatures of oceanic internal waves: a modulation of the cool-skin effect and a modulation of vertical mixing within the diurnal warm layer. Under conditions of weak winds and strong insolation ( which favor formation of a diurnal warm layer), the data reveal a link between the spatially periodic SST fluctuations and subsurface temperature and velocity fluctuations associated with oceanic internal waves, suggesting that some mechanism involving the diurnal warm layer is responsible for the observed signal. Internal-wave signals in skin temperature very closely resemble temperature signals measured at a depth of about 20 cm, indicating that the observed internal-wave SST signal is not a result of modulation of the cool-skin effect. Numerical experiments using a one-dimensional upper ocean model support the notion that internal-wave heaving of the warm-layer base can produce alternating bands of relatively warm and cool SST through the combined effects of surface heating and modulation of wind-driven vertical shear.",,,,,"Farrar, John T./F-3532-2012; Jessup, Andrew T/E-5625-2017","Farrar, John T./0000-0003-3495-1990; Jessup, Andrew T/0000-0003-0463-3289; Zappa, Christopher J/0000-0003-0041-2913",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,JUN 20,2007,112,C6,,,,,,,C06014,10.1029/2006JC003947,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JC003947,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000247536200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The magnitude, sign and significance of these errors depend on the sap-flow rate and on the relationship between stem temperature and air temperature. Sap-flow rates were found to be more prone to errors caused by heat storage effects under low flow conditions than at higher rates of sap flow. Furthermore, daytime fluctuations of air temperature and stem temperature inside the heat balance sensor were either in phase when a low, or in opposite phase when a high sap-flow rate was passing through the stem of the young tree. To investigate this relationship, we developed an experimental set-up with cut stem segments through which tap water could be pressed. This set-up allowed the effects of air temperature and sap-flow rates on stem temperatures within heat balance sensors to be clearly separated. Good mathematical relationships were obtained and were successfully used to assess the relative importance of air temperature and sap-flow rate with respect to the fluctuations in stem temperature of the young oak tree.

Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is critical to ensure sufficient cellular energy production, and it is strongly influenced by temperature. The thermally induced changes to the regulation of specific steps within the OXPHOS process are poorly understood. In our study, we used the eurythermal species of planarian Dugesia tigrina to study the thermal sensitivity of the OXPHOS process at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. We conducted cold acclimation experiments where we measured the adjustment of specific steps in OXPHOS at two assay temperatures (10 and 20 degrees C) following 4 weeks of acclimation under normal (22 degrees C) or low (5 degrees C) temperature conditions. At the low temperature, the contribution of the NADH pathway to the maximal OXPHOS capacity, in a combined pathway (NADH and succinate), was reduced. There was partial compensation by an increased contribution of the succinate pathway. As the temperature decreased, OXPHOS became more limited by the capacity of the phosphorylation system. Acclimation to the low temperature resulted in positive adjustments of the NADH pathway capacity due, at least in part, to an increase in complex I activity. The acclimation also resulted in a better match between OXPHOS and phosphorylation system capacities. Both of these adjustments following acclimation were specific to the low assay temperature. We conclude that there is substantial plasticity in the mitochondrial OXPHOS process following thermal acclimation in D. tigrina, and this probably contributes to the wide thermal range of the species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,SEP,2019,222,18,,,,,,,jeb207951,10.1242/jeb.207951,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.207951,,,,,,,,31439652,,,,,WOS:000488952100012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two of the animals were additionally subjected to air temperatures ranging from -2.4 to 17.8 degrees C while maintaining water temperature approximately 3 degrees C above their individual LCT(w). The LCT(w) ranged from 5.5 to 10.6 degrees C and generally decreased with increasing animal mass; for dolphins in excess of 187kg, the LCT(w) ranged from 5.5 to 5.7 degrees C. No LCT(a) could be determined across the range of air temperatures tested. Core body temperature remained within the limits of normal body temperatures reported for dolphins but demonstrated a direct relationship to water temperature in three subjects and varied across a range of 1.5 degrees C. Air and water temperature had a minimal synergistic effect on dolphin thermoregulation, i.e. water temperature exerted the predominant impact on thermoregulation. For dolphins in excess of 187 kg, water temperature alone would appear to be insufficient to limit the use of habitat north of current bottlenose dolphin ranges along the coastal United States.

Soil samples were obtained in November 2016 to determine the effects of various vehicular passages on C and nitrogen (N) contents and CO2 emissions. Soil CO2 fluxes were measured from November 16, 2016, to May 30, 2017, on the bi-weekly (November to December and April to May) and monthly (January to March) basis by using high-density polyvinyl chloride static gas chambers. The soil CO2 fluxes ranged from -1.05 to 9.03 g CO2 m(-2) d(-1). The lowest soil CO2 fluxes were observed in December coinciding with the minimum soil temperature. In general, daily soil CO2 fluxes were higher under C-0 than those under other treatments. Vehicular traffic and axle load reduced the cumulative emission of CO2 by 22.6 and 29.8% under C-2 and C-4, respectively, compared with that under C-0 (6.09 Mg ha(-1)). Soil and air temperatures had a significant positive correlation with the diurnal fluxes of soil CO2 in all the treatments except that under C-4. Electrical conductivity, soil C and N contents and pools did not differ significantly among the treatments. Further, 2 to 4 passages of vehicles with 2.5 Mg of axle load decreased the soil CO2 emission on Crosby silt loam under NT as compared to that under the control.

Root colonization remained unchanged between the two pulses but warming the hyphal compartment increased ERM length. delta C-13 signals peaked within the first 10 h and were higher in mycorrhizal treatments. The concentration of CO2 in the gas samples fluctuated diurnally and was highest in the mycorrhizal treatments but was unaffected by temperature.

Specifically, we assessed if they were different in their daily pattern of metabolic heat production, regulation of body temperature and use of evaporative heat transfer pathways. Six Nellore bulls with 669 +/- 65 kg of body weight and twelve crossbred bulls (F1, Nellore x Angus) with 606.5 +/- 25.09 kg of body weight, were evaluated in two experiments. Individual bulls were secured and attached to instruments in the biometeorology laboratory to enable recording of the proportion of respiratory gases in the exhaled air (oxygen, O-2; carbon dioxide, CO2), saturation pressure of the exhaled air (PS{T-EXP}, kPa) and skin surface (PS{T-SKIN}, kPa), respiratory rate (R-R, breath min(-1)), ventilation rate (VE, L s(-1)); skin (T-SKIN, degrees C), hair coat (T-S, degrees C), rectal (T-R, degrees C) and exhaled air temperatures (T-EXP, degrees C) from 0600 to 1800 h.

The mean of metabolic heat production was higher for crossbred (2.24 W kg(-1)) than Nellore cattle (1.09 W kg 1) (P <0.0001), as the crossbred had higher values for ventilation rate (P <0.0001), and proportion of the oxygen extracted from the inhaled air.

Yet a comprehensive comparison of thermal performance among animals varying in T-body (mean and variance) and heat production is lacking. Thus, we examined the thermal sensitivity of immune function (a crucial fitness determinant) in Vertebrata, a group encompassing species of varying thermal biology. Specifically, we investigated temperature-related variation in two innate immune performance metrics, hemagglutination and hemolysis, for 13 species across all seven major vertebrate clades. Agglutination and lysis were temperature dependent and were more strongly related to the thermal biology of species (e.g., mean T-body) than to the phylogenetic relatedness of species, although these relationships were complex and frequently surprising (e.g., heterotherms did not exhibit broader thermal performance curves than homeotherms). Agglutination and lysis performance were positively correlated within species, except in taxa that produce squalamine, a steroidal antibiotic that does not lyse red blood cells. Interestingly, we found the antithesis of a generalist-specialist trade-off: species with broader temperature ranges of immune performance also had higher peak performance levels. In sum, we have uncovered thermal sensitivity of immune performance in both endotherms and ectotherms, highlighting the role that temperature and life history play in immune function across Vertebrata.",,,,,,"Butler, Michael/0000-0002-8390-2960",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,JUN,2013,181,6,,,,,761,774,,10.1086/670191,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/670191,,,,,,,,23669539,,,,,WOS:000318996500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Participants using predictive intervals were better able to identify unreliable forecasts, expected a narrower range of outcomes, and were more decisive than were participants using deterministic forecasts. Predictive interval format was also manipulated to determine whether adding visualizations enhanced understanding. Some participants using visualizations misinterpreted predictive intervals as expressions of diurnal fluctuations (deterministic forecasts). Almost no misinterpretations occurred when the predictive interval was expressed in text alone. Moreover, no advantages were found for visualizations over text-only formats, demonstrating that visualizations, especially those investigated in these studies, may not be suitable for expressing this concept. Thus, predictive intervals are both understandable and advantageous to non-expert decision makers, as long as they are carefully expressed.

Seasonal acclimation of terrestrial and aquatic locomotor capacity in newts,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"P>1. Many organisms respond to seasonal temperature fluctuations by the reversible modification of whole-animal performance. Semiaquatic ectotherms, which possess this acclimatory capacity in swimming speed, lack the plastic response in terrestrial locomotor performance and vice versa. Theory predicts that the presence of reversible (seasonal) thermal acclimation or fixed phenotypes depends on the predictability of future thermal conditions (i.e. accuracy of temperature cues) in a given environment. Alternatively, comparative data suggest that thermal acclimation is induced by disparate temperature cues in water and on land. 2. We tested both predictions by examining the seasonal acclimation response in thermal sensitivity of maximal swimming and running speed in adult alpine newts, Ichthyosaura (formerly Triturus) alpestris. 3. Following the seasonal variation in environmental temperatures, we exposed newts to 5 degrees C from November to March and, after a gradual temperature increase, to either a constant (15 degrees C) or fluctuating (10-20 degrees C) thermal regime from May to June. At the end of each treatment, we measured newt swimming and running capacity at five temperatures (range 5-25 degrees C). In the field, hourly temperatures were recorded in various aquatic and terrestrial microhabitats to obtain information about the predictability of thermal conditions in both environments. 4. Seasonal acclimation shaped the thermal sensitivity of swimming speed under both constant and fluctuating temperature treatments. Thermal sensitivity of running speed was markedly modified by a fluctuating thermal regime so that newts ran at the highest test temperature faster than cold-acclimated individuals. Natural thermal environment contained a similar proportion of predictable variation in water and on land. 5. Complex seasonal acclimation of locomotor capacity in newts was influenced by the disparate thermal cues, i.e. mean acclimation temperature or diel temperature fluctuations, rather than by the different accuracy of these cues in water and on land. Future confrontations of theory with empirical data will require more attention not only on the assumptions of adaptive thermal acclimation but also on the ecologically relevant thermal conditions during acclimation experiments.",,,,,"ASCR, IVB/A-9883-2011; Gvoždík, Lumír/G-1178-2014","Gvoždík, Lumír/0000-0002-6495-2233",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,OCT,2010,24,5,,,,,1023,1030,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01720.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01720.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000281895800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Composting is characterized by distinct temperature changes that are associated with a succession of microbial communities adapted to the prevailing temperature. The temperature fluctuations are spatially and temporally variable. The transition between mesophilic and thermophilic communities can result in loss of degradation efficiency. We tested the resilience of microbial communities to temperature fluctuations in laboratory reactors containing tree bark and pulverized wood amended with pot ale liquor, a waste by-product of the whisky manufacturing process. The laboratory reactors were operated in fixed temperature mode at 50degreesC, 35degreesC, and 20degreesC, in three replicates of each treatment, from which COD, suspended solids, BOD and pH of the resultant leachate were monitored on a daily basis. After running at fixed temperatures for 45 days, the reactors, initially operated at 50, 35 and 20degreesC, were switched to 20, 50 and 35degreesC, respectively. A further temperature switch was made after 90 days so that, at the conclusion of the experiment after 135 days, each triplicate set of incubators had experienced a 45-day period at each of the three temperature settings. Microbial community structure, measured using phospholipid fatty acid analysis, showed that communities at different temperatures were quite distinct. The communities conditioned at low temperature adapted to the higher temperature imposed and were indistinguishable from other thermophilic populations. In contrast, the thermophilic communities that had been conditioned at high temperature and switched to low temperature evolved a mesophilic community that was distinct from the mesophilic communities previously conditioned at low temperature. The loss in process efficiency after the thermophilic phase may therefore be limited by the recovery of surviving populations and/or by slow recolonisation from low-temperature zones.",,,,,"Campbell, Colin D/B-3944-2010; Anderson, John G/O-1068-2013","Campbell, Colin D/0000-0002-5163-7656; Anderson, John G/0000-0003-4151-1619",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3-540-67568-X,,,,2002,,,,,,,3,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000177064700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we present results from the cruise. We describe both the mean structures and the response of the upper ocean to changing meteorological conditions in terms of changes in the dynamic and thermodynamic structure over a 10 degrees latitude band and over a period of approximately 70 days. The mean thermal and haline structures were consistent with the ongoing El Nino conditions of 1992-1993. Only between 1 degrees N and 3 degrees N did salinity play a greater role than that of temperature in the mean stratification of the upper 80 m. The zonal currents were weak in the mean but highly variable, correlating significantly in the 0-60 m depth range with the zonal winds. We show that a cyclonic, cold core structure, identified at 2 degrees S around January 9, will heavily influence any heat budget performed there. Meteorological conditions varied dramatically during the experiment, with strong westerlies, strong easterlies, and periods of little wind observed. Throughout these conditions and at all latitudes a diurnal thermal cycle was seen. The maximum depth of the diurnal thermocline varied from 30 to 35 m, being shallower at more southerly latitudes. The near-surface temperature showed a mean diurnal signal of approximately 0.4 degrees C. The halocline depth also exhibited a diurnal signal of around 17 m, suggesting that salinity stratification plays a role in limiting vertical mixing at all latitudes, and more so in northern latitudes. Thicker barrier layers were found north of the equator; we show that barrier layers thicker than approximately 25 m correspond to significantly reduced entrainment cooling of the mixed layer (0(0.1 degrees C)). The observed spatial and temporal variability is discussed in the context of the analyses made by others within the intensive flux array near 2 degrees S.",,,,,"Inall, Mark/I-4835-2014","Inall, Mark/0000-0002-1624-4275",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 15,1998,103,C10,,,,,21385,21400,,10.1029/98JC01681,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/98JC01681,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000075863500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thermal experiments typically use constant temperatures; however, weather and hydrography cause marine temperatures to fluctuate on diel cycles and over multiple days. We incubated natural communities of phytoplankton collected from California coastal waters during spring, summer, and fall under present-day and future mean temperatures, using thermal treatments that were either constant or fluctuated on a 48 h cycle. As assayed by marker-gene sequencing, the emergent microbial communities were consistent within each season, except when culture temperatures exceeded the highest temperature recorded in a 10-year local thermal dataset. When temperature treatments exceeded the 10-year maximum the phytoplankton community shifted, becoming dominated by diatom amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) not seen at lower temperatures. When mean temperatures were above the 10-year maximum, constant and fluctuating regimes each selected for different ASVs. These findings suggest coastal microbial communities are largely adapted to the current range of temperatures they experience. They also suggest a general hypothesis whereby multiyear upper temperature limits may represent thresholds, beyond which large community restructurings may occur. Now inevitable future temperature increases that exceed these environmental thresholds, even temporarily, may fundamentally reshape marine microbial communities and therefore the biogeochemical cycles that they mediate.",,,,,"Hutchins, David A/D-3301-2013","Hutchins, David A/0000-0002-6637-756X; Qu, Pingping/0000-0003-2487-5402",,,,,,,,,,,,,1751-7362,1751-7370,,,,FEB,2020,14,2,,,,,413,424,,10.1038/s41396-019-0525-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41396-019-0525-6,,,,,,,,31636366,,,,,WOS:000509197100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature is a key factor in the growth and development of all organisms(1,2). Plants have to interpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development with the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses(3,4), but the mechanisms that integrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3)(5-7), a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically silenceFLOWERING LOCUS C(FLC) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression(5,6,8-11). Here, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that constitutively activateVIN3expression and alter the slowVIN3cold induction profile. In the wild type, the NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulatesVIN3transcription. Through combining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this slow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent growth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information forVIN3upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct thermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures.",,,,,"Antoniou-Kourounioti, Rea Laila/AAY-3284-2020; Howard, Martin/C-3629-2016","Antoniou-Kourounioti, Rea Laila/0000-0001-5226-521X; Dean, Caroline/0000-0002-6555-3525; Zhao, Yusheng/0000-0002-5893-504X; Howard, Martin/0000-0001-7670-0781",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-0836,1476-4687,,,,JUL 30,2020,583,7818,,,,,825,+,,10.1038/s41586-020-2485-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2485-4,,JUL 2020,,,,,,32669706,,,,,WOS:000552814800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Female cephalothorax length was 840 +/- 52 and 692 +/- 39 mu m at 9 and 24 degrees C, respectively. Parallel hatching experiments were performed between non-acclimatized and acclimatized cultures across a range of temperatures reflecting natural conditions in Danish waters. A greater fraction of eggs enter quiescence as temperature declines. Eggs were able to hatch at temperatures as low as 1.5 degrees C. Final egg hatching success increased with temperature. Acclimatization of the copepods resulted in a lower maximum hatching rate, but a higher final hatching success at 9 and 6 degrees C compared with egg hatching from non-acclimatized copepods. Eggs develop significantly better at low temperatures when compared with females in culture. This adaptation suggests that the observed annual population fluctuations in, for example, Danish waters can be explained as follows: the population of copepods in the pelagic virtually die out during the autumn-winter months; the population the following year emerges from resting eggs from the sediment and is produced by the pelagic copepods the previous year(s).",,,,,"Drillet, Guillaume/B-6608-2009; Hansen, Benni W/K-3299-2015","Hansen, Benni W/0000-0003-1145-561X; Drillet, Guillaume/0000-0001-5908-0568",,,,,,,,,,,,,0142-7873,,,,,MAR,2010,32,3,,,,,305,315,,10.1093/plankt/fbp122,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbp122,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000274339900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Frequent measurements were performed during the first 28 days of soil-fertilizer incubation. The peak of ammonia volatilization from the soil occurred in the first week after the application of traditional urea, and two or three days later for urea with urease inhibitor. Ammonia loss was not always higher from conventional than from treated urea, nor from solid than from liquid fertilizers. Ammonia volatilization increased with increases in soil pH, temperature and N rate and was lower at the lowest (5 %) and highest (20 %) soil moisture content. For surface-applied fertilizers, the maximum daily N loss rate was 14 kg ha(-1) and the total cumulative loss ranged from 2 to 50 % of the applied N, depending mainly on the physical state of the fertilizer, temperature and on soil moisture.

The number of laid eggs increased for the first 10 days before reaching a plateau, ranging daily from less than 10 to more than 1000 eggs per parasite, with the mean daily output throughout the observation period being 51.2-362 eggs per parasite. Egg strings laid in a single output were calculated to be 2-157 cm long. The frequency of egg-laying, monitored in a fish with a single parasite, ranged from several outputs in a day to no egg-laying for up to 3 days.

Predicting the consequences of warming requires understanding how temperature affects ingestion (energy gain) and metabolism (energy loss). Here, we studied the temperature dependence of metabolism and ingestion in laboratory experiments with terrestrial arthropods (beetles and spiders). From this data, we calculated ingestion efficiencies (ingestion/metabolism) and per capita interaction strengths in the short and long term. Additionally, we investigated if and how body mass changes these temperature dependencies. For both predator groups, warming increased metabolic rates substantially, whereas temperature effects on ingestion rates were weak. Accordingly, the ingestion efficiency (the ratio of ingestion to metabolism) decreased in all treatments. This result has two possible consequences: on the one hand, it suggests that warming of natural ecosystems could increase intrinsic population stability, meaning less fluctuations in population density; on the other hand, decreasing ingestion efficiencies may also lead to higher extinction risks because of starvation. Additionally, predicted long-term per capita interaction strengths decreased with warming, which suggests an increase in perturbation stability of populations, i.e., a higher probability of returning to the same equilibrium density after a small perturbation.

We investigated the effect of different temperature regimes (constant 30 A degrees C, constant 35 A degrees C, fluctuating with a daily mean of 30 A degrees C, or fluctuating with a daily mean of 35 A degrees C) on sex-specific development time and body mass in Tribolium castaneum. Using a half-sib breeding design, we also examined whether there is any evidence for genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI) for the studied traits. In response to fluctuating temperature regimes, beetles demonstrated reaction norm patterns in which thermal fluctuations influenced traits negatively above the species' thermal optimum but had little to no effect close to the thermal optimum. Estimated heritabilities of development time were in general low and non-significant. In case of body mass of pupae and adults, despite significant genetic variance, we did not find any GEI due to crossing of reaction norms, both between temperatures and between variability treatments. We have observed a weak tendency towards higher heritabilities of adult and pupa body mass in optimal fluctuating thermal conditions. Thus, we have not found any biasing effect of stable thermal conditions as compared to fluctuating temperatures on the breeding values of heritable body-size traits.

The resulting data set contained a large amount of temporally highly resolved information on the variation in Soil CO2 efflux together with environmental variables. Based on this background, the dependencies of the soil CO2 efflux rate on the controlling environmental factors were analysed in-depth. Of the abiotic factors, soil temperature alone explained 72% of the variation in the efflux rate, and including soil water content (SWC) as an additional variable increased the explained variance to about 83%. Between April and December, average rates ranged from 0.43 to 5.15 mumol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) (in November and July, respectively) with diurnal variations of up to 50% throughout the experiment. The variability in wind speed above the forest floor influenced the CO2 efflux rates for measuring locations with a litter layer of relatively low bulk density (and hence relatively high proportions of pore spaces). For the temporal integration of flux rates for time scales of hours to days, however, wind velocities were of no effect, reflecting the fact that wind forcing acts on the transport, but not the production Of CO2 in the soil. The variation in both the magnitude of the basal respiration rate and the temperature sensitivity throughout the growing season was only moderate (coefficient of variation of 15 and 25%, respectively). Soil water limitation of the CO2 production in the soil could be best explained by a reduction in the temperature-insensitive basal respiration rate, with no discernible effect on the temperature sensitivity. Using a Soil CO2 efflux model with soil temperature and SWC as driving variables, it was possible to calculate the annual Soil CO2 efflux for four consecutive years for which meteorological data were available. These simulations indicate an average efflux sum of 560 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (SE = 22 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). An alternative model derived from the same data but using temperature alone as a driver over-estimated the annual flux sum by about 7% and showed less inter-annual variability. Given a likely shift in precipitation patterns alongside temperature changes under projected global change scenarios, these results demonstrate the necessity to include soil moisture in models that calculate the evolution Of CO2 from temperate forest soils.

Aims We evaluated the ability of the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model to predict field-measured soil surface CO2 and N2O emissions in crop rotations managed with cover crop (CC) and without cover crop (NC) under the 27-year no-till field experiment in South Dakota, USA. Methods Emissions were measured in a 2-year corn-soybean and a 4-year corn-soybean-oat-winter wheat rotation. The model was calibrated with 2-year NC treatment and evaluated against three treatments (2-year CC, 4-year NC and 4-year CC) during the growing season of corn (2017) and soybean (2018). Key results Across all treatments, the model simulated soil temperature (MBE, -0.73-0.29 degrees C; RMSE, 1.47-4.03 degrees C; NSE, 0.54-0.90; d, 0.89-0.98; R-2, 0.64-0.93) and moisture [water-filled porosity (wfps)] (MBE, 0.03-0.06 wfps; RMSE, 0.09-40.13 wfps; NSE, -0.24-0.49; d, 0.78-0.87; R-2, 0.45-0.69) that agreed well with field measurements. Predicted daily soil CO2 fluxes (kg C ha(-1)) provided 'good' agreement with MBE (range -0.58-4.67), RMSE (range 2.10-7.36), d (range 0.68-0.93), NSE (range -0.92-0.79), and R-2 (range 0.49-0.85). Statistics showed 'poor' agreement between the simulated and measured daily N2O emissions because peak emissions events in the measured data were less than predicted. Cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions and crop yields were well estimated by the model.

We studied the interaction between spring environmental conditions, egg and larval abundances, and growth rates, of pearlside Maurolicus australis along a 10 degrees latitudinal range in western Patagonia. Using onboard field experiments, otolith-based back-calculated daily growth rates, CTD data, together with sea surface temperature (SST, 2002-2019) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a, 2017-2018) satellite images, we studied the effect of short-term mesoscale variability on larval growth as well as their interactions with environmental conditions. SST of 2017 and 2018 were similar, with colder than average (2003-2018) springs for both years. Onboard experiments indicated that egg size directly influenced the size-at-hatch, though this was independent of lipid reserves. Larvae were categorized into Oceanic (Oc), Inner Seas (IS) and off the Southern Ice Fields (SIF). On the shelf (Oc), larvae were more abundant with faster growth rates; a second maximum density was observed off the SIF. The latter individuals had the smallest otolith-at-size and showed the slowest recent growth rates, despite spatially coinciding with relatively large Chl-a concentrations (>8 mg m(-2)). Latitudinally, the decrease in sea surface temperatures and the rise in vertical salinity gradients, reduced the recent larval growth of the pearlside. However, daily fluctuations in SST did not trigger significant variations in the back-calculated detrend growth rates. Although low temperatures in the SIF lead to slow growth rates of M. australis, compared to the northern population, the area presents some benefits regarding food availability, retention and protection from predators. Moreover, it is possible that the low temperatures might affect the energy balance of fish larval stages by intervening in the allocation of energy for tissue formation and metabolism, resulting in slow growth rates in the southern population.",,,,,"LANDAETA, MAURICIO/X-4293-2019","LANDAETA, MAURICIO/0000-0002-5199-5103; Molina, Victor/0000-0001-9651-1515",,,,,,,,,,,,,0079-6611,1873-4472,,,,JUL,2021,195,,,,,,,,102572,10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102572,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102572,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000660310500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The implementation of tillage with mulching during fallow after the autumn harvest may be an effective management strategy to help reduce soil evaporation and conserve more soil water for spring sown potato. We conducted a three-year field experiment in a semiarid area of the Loess Plateau in 2014-2015, 2015-2016, and 2016-2017 to study the interactive effects of autumn tillage and mulching practices during fallow on the soil temperature, moisture, tuber yield, and water-use efficiency of potato. The treatments comprised three tillage systems in the main plots, i.e., no-tillage (NT), subsoiling (ST), and plowing tillage (PT), and three mulching methods in the subplots, i.e., straw mulch (SM), plastic-film mulch (PM), and no mulch (NM), in a replicated split plot design. Autumn tillage with mulching during fallow significantly influenced the soil water storage, especially in the early growing season of potato. Among the mulching methods, SM and PM increased the mean soil water storage by 6.3% and 5.9% (P < 0.05), respectively, compared with the NM plots. Conservation tillage combined with PM (NT x PM and ST x PM) significantly increased the topsoil temperature, whereas conservation tillage combined with SM (NT x SM and ST x SM) significantly decreased the temperature, which could have improved the topsoil conditions for potato tuber yield formation in the three experimental years. Among the tillage systems, the PM plots increased the mean topsoil temperature by 2.4 degrees C (P < 0.05), whereas the SM plots reduced the temperature by 3.0 degrees C (P < 0.05) during the whole period. The beneficial effects of the changes in moisture and temperature in the PM and SM plots improved the tuber yield of potato, in comparison with NM plots. Tillage and mulching had significant interaction effects on the potato tuber yield and water-use efficiency. The highest mean potato tuber yields were obtained in the ST x SM and NT x SM treatments, respectively, which were 41.0% and 35.3% higher (P < 0.05) than those with the PT x NM treatment. The three-year mean water-use efficiency increased significantly by 50.5% and 39.9% (P < 0.05) under the ST x SM and NT x SM treatments, respectively, and the three-year mean rainwater-use efficiency increased by 30% and 29% (P < 0.05) when compared with CT x NM treatment. Overall, our findings demonstrate that conservation tillage with SM and PM significantly increased the potato tuber yield and water-use efficiency. Considering the years with warm and dry climate conditions, we recommend conservation tillage with SM may be a more efficient method for improving the potato productivity, WUE and RUE in the semiarid region of the Loess Plateau.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-3774,1873-2283,,,,SEP 1,2019,224,,,,,,,,105747,10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105747,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105747,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000495461500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

A.",,,Can animal performance be predicted from short-term grazing processes?,ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite all the biotic and abiotic factors affecting foraging by ruminants, there is a common and fundamental process, which is bite gathering. We hypothesised that because the mechanics of bite formation dominate the foraging process, changes in short-term bite mass are reflected in longer-term animal performance across a wide range of sward conditions. We focus at the meal level of foraging, using experiments in which the effect of abiotic factors and digestive constrains are minimised, making intake rate the main currency. We estimated bite mass across a wide range of structural challenges to large-herbivore foraging in a long-term experiment with heterogeneous native grasslands. A conceptual model was developed for average daily gain, where energy gain and energy costs were proximate causal variables. Energy gain was a function of diet quality and components of daily intake rate, where bite mass was the main component estimated. In turn, components of intake rate were determined by sward structure and bodyweight. Energy costs were a function of bodyweight and abiotic conditions. Finally, sward structure, bodyweight and abiotic conditions were determined by experimental treatments, seasons and years. Then, the conceptual model was translated into statistical models that included variables measured or estimated, and coefficients representing all links in the conceptual model. Weight gain was a function of bite mass, forage characteristics, and animal and abiotic conditions. Models were set up to test whether forage and stocking conditions affected monthly gain beyond the effects through bite mass, after correcting for abiotic factors. Forage mass, height and disappearance did help predict monthly gain after bite mass was included in the model, which supported our hypothesis. However, stocking treatments and season had significant effects not incorporated in bite mass. Although the model explained 77.9% of liveweight gain variation, only 35.2% was due to fixed effects, with 10.8% accounted by bite mass and its interactions. Concomitant experiments showed that sward structure (first with sward height and the second with tussock cover) does determine bite mass and short-term intake rate in the complex native grasslands we studied. Yet, other temporal varying components of monthly gain not correlated with bite mass, temperature or wind, added most of the observed variation in monthly animal performance. Part of the model failure to account for variation in performance may be related to a significant and temporally variable grazing of tussocks. We used a bite mass model that assumed no tussock grazing. In light of these results and a parallel experiment, we conclude that tussock grazing must be incorporated in future versions of the model.",,,,,"Bonnet, Olivier/J-3702-2015; Da Trindade, Julio Kuhn/G-9254-2012; de Faccio Carvalho, Paulo César/A-7381-2012; Bremm, Carolina/ABC-5134-2020","Da Trindade, Julio Kuhn/0000-0001-5022-2320; de Faccio Carvalho, Paulo César/0000-0002-7020-3001; Bremm, Carolina/0000-0002-7612-2771; Laca, Emilio/0000-0002-7551-0721",,,,,,,,,,,,,1836-0939,1836-5787,,,,,2015,55,3,,,,,319,327,,10.1071/AN14546,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN14546,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000349524500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Six cases of gradient Richardson number, Ri(g) = N-2/(d (U) over bar /dz)(2), where N is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency (N-2 = (g/(T) over bar )d (T) over bar /dz), are studied, spanning a range 0.015 less than or equal to Ri(g) less than or equal to 0.5. Three- to five-hundred high-resolution temperature profiles are made for several streamwise stations for each case of Ri,. These measurements are supplemented with standard fixed-point, Eulerian measurements of streamwise and vertical velocity fluctuations and temperature fluctuations and with an eight-point vertical rake of temperature probes using standard hot-wire and cold-wire techniques. Vertical profiles uniquely enable the computation of available potential energy (APE), Thorpe scales (L-Th;), and the diapycnal flux (phi (d)), as well, as one-dimensional vertical wavenumber temperature spectra. These quantities are compared with Eulerian measurements of turbulent kinetic energy (KE), potential energy (PE), and buoyancy flux. It is found that the one-dimensional vertical wavenumber temperature spectrum contains more energy at smaller scales compared to the horizontal spectrum, owing in part to shear distortion, which leads to larger mean square vertical gradients of fluctuating temperature as compared to mean square horizontal gradients. The combination of shear and stratification, especially for cases where the turbulence decays with evolution, accelerates the evolution toward small-scale anisotropy compared to just shear or just stratification. It is found that in highly stratified cases, the diapycnal flux can persist after buoyancy flux has collapsed to negligible values, indicating enhanced heat transfer without turbulent mixing. For low Ri(g), large-scale vertical advection creates both high local temperature gradients and regions of static instability. Associated with the regions of instability is APE, which grows relative to KE for the least stratified cases. For high Ri(g), the turbulence evolves to a wavelike state, containing some counter gradient fluxes and unstable patches. This wavelike state has higher heat flux efficiency than the more turbulent states owing to the low dissipation but relatively high diapycnal flux.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1120,1469-7645,,,,DEC 25,2000,425,,,,,,1,29,,10.1017/S0022112000002111,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112000002111,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000166307300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To characterize the physiological response of some common Mediterranean gorgonians to fluctuations in temperature, four species (Paramuricea clavata, Eunicella singularis, Eunicella cavolinii and Corallium rubrum) were maintained in aquaria, in which the temperature was increased every ten days with increments of 2-3 degrees C, starting at 14 degrees C, ending at 25 degrees C. Oxygen consumption, number of open/closed polyps and percentage of necrotic tissue were monitored. All species showed similar activity patterns with increasing temperature. P. clavata and E. singularis showed the highest respiration rate at 18 degrees C, E. cavolinii and C rubrum at 20 degrees C. Above these temperatures, both oxygen consumption and polyp reactivity decreased in all species. The present data confirm a reduction of the metabolic activity in Mediterranean gorgonians during periods of high temperature. At temperatures above 18 degrees C, the percentage of open polyps (considered as a parameter to evaluate polyps reactivity) decreased, thus mirroring the trend of oxygen consumption. The average values of Q(10) indicated that gorgonians have a definite temperature limit over which the metabolism (oxygen consumption) stop to follow the temperature increase. After three days at 25 degrees C, metabolic activity in E. cavolinii, C. rubrum and P. clavata further decreased and the first signs of necrosis were observed. At this temperature, activity remained unchanged in E. singularis. This species seems to more resistant to thermal stress. The symbiotic zooxanthellae present in this species are likely to provide an alternative source of energy when polyps reduce their feeding activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This article reports an attempt to reproduce miniature sorted patterns by repeating needle-ice formation, which simulates frost sorting in regions dominated by diurnal freeze-thaw cycles. Six full-scale laboratory models were tested. They consisted of near-saturated volcanic fine soil topped by small stones of uniform size; the models explored a range of stone size (similar to 6, similar to 12, similar to 17 and similar to 22mm) and surface abundance (20, 40 and 60% cover). The stones were placed in a grid on the surface. These models were subjected to 20-30 temperature excursions between 10 degrees C and -5 degrees C in 12hours. The evolution of surface patterns were visually traced by photogrammetry. A data logging system continuously monitored vertical soil displacements, soil temperatures and moistures at different depths. All experimental runs displayed needle-ice formation (2-3cm in height) and resulting displacement of stones. The soil domains tended to heave faster and higher than the stones, leading to outward movement of the former and concentration of the stones. In plan view, smaller stones showed relatively fast and long-lasting movements, while larger stones stabilized after the first five cycles. The 20% stone cover produced stone islands, whereas the 40% cover resulted in sorted labyrinths (a circle-island complex) that may represent incipient sorted circles. The average diameter or spacing of these forms are 12-13cm, being comparable to those in the field. The experiments imply that needle-ice activity promotes rapid formation of sorted patterns, although the formation of well-defined sorted circles may require hundreds of diurnal frost heave cycles.

This was done by applying the models at a set of generic forest types, in combination with climate scenarios generated in accordance with recent GCM output. In the scenario analysis, special attention was paid to acclimation of forest ecosystems to changing site conditions, impacts on growth rates, and impacts on phenology and timing of vegetation-atmosphere exchange of water and carbon dioxide. Results obtained so far show high variation in model output, even when applied using the same input data for site conditions, thereby reflecting the differences in modelling concepts and the resulting differences in sensitivity to changing site conditions. Modelling results show agreement on growth increases as a result of increased CO, and temperature, but the variation in model output requires additional model evaluation to determine the suitability of the individual models for such scenario analysis. In the second phase of the project (1998-2000) the models will be updated using recent results from experimental work such as carried out within the ECOCRAFT project, and the models will be tested against time series of daily values of carbon and water fluxes such as measured in the EUROFLUX programme using eddy-covariance measurements. Based on this evaluation, selected models will then be used in combination with forest inventory data to analyse regional-scale impacts of climate change on forests, as well as regional feedback's in terms of carbon sequestration and timing of carbon and water fluxes over Europe.",,,,,"Mohren, Godefridus M.J./C-5608-2015","Mohren, Godefridus M.J./0000-0002-7004-4602",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0-7923-4921-0,,,,1998,52,,,,,,307,316,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000074895800040,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ectoparasite removal is an obvious hypothesis to explain nocturnal basking and has also been proposed as a key driver of diurnal basking. However, the efficacy of basking, day or night, to remove leeches has not been experimentally tested. Therefore, we examined the number of leeches that were removed from Krefft's river turtles (Emydura macquarii krefftii) after experimentally making turtles bask at a range of times of day, durations, and temperatures. Turtles had high initial leech loads, with a mean of 32.1 leeches per turtle. Diurnal basking under a heat lamp for 3 hr at ~28 degrees C significantly reduced numbers of leeches relative to controls. In diurnal trials, 90.9% of turtles lost leeches (mean loss of 7.1 leeches per turtle), whereas basking for 30 min under the same conditions was not effective (no turtles lost leeches, and all turtles were still visibly wet). Similarly, nocturnal basking at ~23 degrees C for 3 hr was not effective at removing leeches. Only 18% of turtles lost leeches (one turtle lost one leech and another lost four leeches). Diurnal basking outdoors under direct sunlight for 20 min (mean temp = 34.5 degrees C) resulted in a small reduction in leeches, with 50% of turtles losing leeches and an average loss of 0.7 leeches per turtle. These results indicate basking can remove leeches if temperatures are high or basking durations are long. However, it was only effective at unusually long basking durations in this system. Our data showed even the 20-min period was longer than 70.1% of natural diurnal basking events, many of which took place at cooler temperatures. Therefore, leech removal does not appear to be the purpose of the majority of basking events.",,,,,"Schwarzkopf, Lin/C-1242-2012","Schwarzkopf, Lin/0000-0002-1009-670X; Nordberg, Eric/0000-0002-1333-622X; Wirth, Wytamma/0000-0001-7070-0078",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,AUG,2021,11,16,,,,,10936,10946,,10.1002/ece3.7876,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7876,,,,,,,,34429892,,,,,WOS:000685910200018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Soil and air temperatures under the mulch treatments and in the open were recorded and the daily accumulation of Ontario heat units (OUs) calculated for each treatment based on the air temperatures experienced by the crop for the periods that it was under plastic mulch and in the open. The interval from sowing to emergence was proportional to the accumulated heat units above a soil base temperature of 8.2degreesC. The phenology of leaf emergence varied widely in terms of calendar date across the sowing date and plastic mulch treatments but relative to adjusted OUs the treatments were more closely aligned. Treatment PU advanced the crop less than the other mulch treatments relative to calendar date but, relative to OUs, more than these treatments. Physical damage to plants emerging through the TC treatment and air temperatures exceeding 40degreesC during the first month under treatments TC and EL did not appear to retard physiological development. The total adjusted OUs to reach 50% silking ranged from 1432 to 1753. Close relationships were found between the total OUs from silking to harvest and the whole crop DM content, cob DM content, cob yield and starch concentration of the whole crop at harvest so that differences between the treatments could largely be accounted for by the differences in silking date. It was concluded that the OU system can provide a reasonable model of maize growth for crops sown under TC plastic mulch providing air temperatures under the plastic are used for the period that the crop experiences them. However, the OU system is less reliable for crops grown under punch plastic because of the soil warming effect of the mulch that is not taken into account by the OU system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0142-5242,,,,,DEC,2003,58,4,,,,,372,384,,10.1111/j.1365-2494.2003.00390.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2003.00390.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000189025400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, we compared the effects of treatment 2 versus the effects of having a set temperature during photophase and another set temperature during scotophase versus a constant daily average temperature. The experimental design was completely random, and 150 nymphs were used per treatment at the outset of the biossays. However, the number of repetitions was altered in relation to survival of the aphids in the different instars and treatments. By daily use of a stereoscopic microscope, we evaluated the following parameters: the duration (days) and survival (%) of each instar and stage as well as the reproductive capacity (offspring per female per day) and the longevity (days) of adults. The simulation of mean hourly temperatures of an uncontrolled greenhouse favored the survival, reproductive capacity, and longevity of adults -which are factors of great importance in the insect population growth -compared with those insects kept at 27 degrees C (photophase) and 18 degrees C (scotophase) or kept at the constant daily average temperature.

Cold stress caused slower shifts in the bacterial community in winter than in summer, whereas a more rapid shift occurred under heat stress in both seasons. Results supported our hypothesis that bacterial community composition of corals in winter are more stable in cold temperatures but changed rapidly in hot temperatures, with opposite results for the bacterial communities in summer.

The results reveal that projected warming would enhance sulphide toxicity in P. oceanica and, hence, the risk of seagrass loss. We assessed sulphide stress of seagrasses by estimating the sulphide intrusion (F-sulphide) into leaf tissue from the sulphur isotopic signature in sediments (delta S-34(sulphide)), in the water column (delta S-34(sulphate)) and in P. oceanica leaves (delta S-34(tissue)). Seagrasses were grown at 6 seawater temperature treatments, ranging from 26 degrees C to 32 degrees C, in 3 replicated experimental mesocosms for 50 days. At the end of the experiment, the seagrass shoots in all of the treatments exhibited sulphide intrusion (F-sulphide > 0%), which had been negligible when the experiment started. Similarly, the leaf delta S-34(tissue) was lighter at the end of the experiment than at the beginning, when seagrasses in the field were experiencing a seawater temperature of 23 degrees C. F-sulphide linearly increased with experimental warming, while leaf delta S-34(tissue) declined with increasing temperature at a rate of 0.3 parts per thousand for each centigrade degree of warming. The daily production of new leaves per shoot decreased as the sediment became more reduced. Leaf delta S-34(tissue) below 20.5 parts per thousand, indicative of 1% sulphide intrusion, is expected to compromise P. oceanica performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, we investigated induction after floods, in relation to fluctuating temperature requirements for germination in seeds from mountain, floodplain and successional grasslands. A laboratory experiment was conducted in which seeds were imbibed or immersed in water at 5 degrees C. Seeds were also buried in flood-prone and upland grasslands and exhumed during the flooding season. Additionally, seeds were buried in flooded or drained grassland mesocosms. Germination of exhumed seeds was assayed at 25 degrees C or at 20 degrees C/30 degrees C in the dark or in the presence of red light pulses. After submergence or soil flooding, a high fraction (>32%) of seeds from the floodplain required fluctuating temperatures to germinate. In contrast, seeds from the mountains showed maximum differences in germination between fluctuating and constant temperature treatment only after imbibition (35%) or in non-flooded soil conditions (40%). The fluctuating temperature requirement was not clearly related to the foregoing conditions in the successional grassland seeds. Maximum germination could also be attained with red light pulses to seeds from mountain and successional grasslands. Results show that the fluctuating temperature requirement might help floodplain seeds to germinate after floods, indicating a unique feature of the dormancy of S. parviflora seeds from floodplains, which suggests an adaptive advantage aimed at postponing emergence during inundation periods.

Four models were validated using data from three generations of natural populations of the pest. All models gave a good prediction for both embryos and larvae in all the years considered.

Landsat 8 data is used for experimentation during 21st Jan 2018 and 6th Feb 2018 for LST analysis of identified area. More than half of the land area in the Mandya district is under agricultural use. Fluctuations in LST affects the quality of agricultural production. As a result, proper estimation of LST is very much required for the management of crop growth, development, and yield component. Spectral radiance from band 10 and emissivity of thermal infrared bands was used as input for LST estimation. Surface emissivity was obtained with the help of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Albedo in the Mandya region. ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS software were used for modeling. The obtained data compared with weather station data collected by KSNDMC (Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre). For this analysis, we considered two sets of data taken on different dates during the said period. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient are used as statistical criteria for evaluating the model efficiency. From the comparison, it is found that RMSE and R for the first date are 0.94 degrees C, 0.62, and for the second date, it is 1.26 degrees C, 0.88, respectively.

Little information is available about the ambient temperatures above which group-housed pigs start to adapt their mechanisms of balancing heat loss and heat production. The temperature above which an adaptive response occurs (also called the critical temperature or inflection point temperature) may well differ depending on which physiological or behavioral parameter is studied. The objective of these studies was to determine the reactions of pigs to a hot environment (experiment 1) and to study the effects of different cooling systems (sprinklers and water bath) on behavioral, physiological and productive parameters (experiment 2). In experiment one 12 groups of 10 pigs of 60 kg were studied in respiration chambers. Each day, the temperature was increased by 2 degrees C from low (16 degrees C) to high (32 degrees C). In experiment two 12 groups of 5 pigs were studied under the humid tropical climate of Viet Nam. The pig's first visible reaction to increasing ambient temperature was a change in behavior. Wallowing was the first of all behavioral changes. It occurs at relatively low ambient temperature: from 16 to 17 degrees C. The first physiological reaction to high ambient temperatures was an increase in respiration rate; on average this occurred at 22.4 degrees C. An increase in rectal temperature occurred above an average ambient temperature of 26.1 degrees C. This implies that pigs can prevent an increase in their body temperature for an ambient temperature range of about 3.7 degrees C. An increase in rectal temperature and an extra reduction in feed intake are indicators that room temperature is clearly above the upper limit of the thermal neutral zone. Pigs in pens with sprinklers or water bath had lower respiration rate and skin temperature than pigs in control pens, especially during the hot period of the day in pens with outside yard. No effect of cooling on the rectal temperature was found. Pigs in pens with outside yard without cooling were less active than pigs in cooling pens. Pigs in control pens were lying more in lateral position than pigs in the cooled pens. Pigs in pens with sprinklers had the highest feed intake and the highest daily gain. It is concluded that the availability of cooling systems reduces heat stress in pigs. The indicators of heat stress found in this study could be used as set points for these cooling systems, in order to improve animal performance and welfare in hot conditions.",,,,,"Verstegen, Martin W.

We conducted a series of laboratory experiments to evaluate the tolerance of Burbot embryos to various thermal regimes. Both cyclical and constant warming between 4.0 degrees C and 5.5 degrees C during the initial 25 degree-days of embryo development led to significant deformity and mortality of protolarvae, with faster rates of temperature increase (i.e., 0.4 degrees C/d) causing greater harm than gradual rates of warming. Random family effects interacted with incubation temperature of embryos to account for significant variability in deformity and survival of protolarvae. These findings have management implications for identifying and/or augmenting the thermal fitness of populations in modified ecosystems, particularly in Burbot populations where aquaculture production supports abundance. A model of hatching time based on degree-days of embryo development was also developed to improve predictions of natural emergence, peak larvae abundance, and optimal timing for larvae stocking. It is recommended that hydropower operations avoid thermopeaking during winter spawning of Burbot, especially if reservoir discharges exceed 4 degrees C. Maintaining water temperatures below 3 degrees C for at least the first 2 weeks of embryogenesis is critical for Burbot reproduction and underscores the importance of ice-covered spawning habitats.

J., 2013, 105, 2385] applicable to a wider range of temperatures based on experimental data analysis of F1 derived from thermophilic Bacillus under high ATP concentration conditions. Our simulation shows that the rotary angle distribution manifests a stronger non-equilibrium feature as the temperature increases, because ATP hydrolysis and Pi release are more accelerated compared with the timescale of rotary angle relaxation. This effect causes the rate coefficient obtained from dwell time fitting to deviate from the Arrhenius relation in Pi release, which has been assumed in the previous activation thermodynamic quantities estimation using linear Arrhenius fitting. Larger negative correlation is also found between hydrolysis and Pi release waiting time in a catalytic dwell with the increase in temperature. This loss of independence between the two successive reactions at the catalytic dwell sheds doubt on the conventional dwell time fitting to obtain rate coefficients with a double exponential function at temperatures higher than 65 degrees C, which is close to the physiological temperature of the thermophilic Bacillus.",,,,,"Watanabe, Rikiya/AAO-1390-2021","Watanabe, Rikiya/0000-0001-7146-2745; Komatsuzaki, Tamiki/0000-0001-7175-8474; Li, Chun-Biu/0000-0001-8009-6265",,,,,,,,,,,,,1463-9076,1463-9084,,,,JAN 21,2018,20,3,,,,,1872,1880,,10.1039/c7cp06256g,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7cp06256g,,,,,,,,29292807,,,,,WOS:000423019600055,View Full Record in Web of Science

Extensive efforts to exploit the potential of remotely sensed observations to help quantify this complex variable are still underway. Among the various methods, several investigators have explored a combination of surface temperatures and spectral vegetation index (SVI) measurements, the TVX method, as a means to account for the variable influence of vegetation cover in soil moisture assessment. Although considerable empirical evidence has been presented exploring the potential of TVX methods to assess regional moisture conditions, less attention has been given to assessing the underlying biophysics of the observed TVX patterns. In this study, the Simplified Simple Biosphere (SSiB) model is exploited to examine the factors that lead to the observed TVX relation. For a range of typical, midlatitude, growing season conditions, the SSiB model produces the expected TVX relationship, surface temperature decreases with increasing SVI values. The most critical factors that cause the TVX relation to vary include near-surface soil moisture (2 cm), incident radiation (IR), and, to a lesser degree, wind speed. Whereas many empirical studies have suggested that the slope of the TVX relation may provide an important diagnostic of soil moisture conditions, in this analysis, the impact of plant stomatal function is shown to confuse this interpretation of the TVX slope. However, other aspects of the TVX metrics, specifically bare soil temperature and canopy temperature. do provide diagnostic near-surface soil moisture information. Growing season variations in TVX metrics were examined for the conditions recorded at the Hydrological and Atmospheric Pilot Experiment-Modelisation du Bilan Hydrique (HAPEX-Mobilhy) study site. The results from this analysis indicate that soil and canopy temperatures vary as a function of soil moisture conditions and, to a lesser degree, as a result of varying solar insolation and wind speed. The results also show that the TVX metrics are able to provide daily soil moisture variation up to 2 cm of soil depth and seasonal trend up to 10 cm. Using the satellite-derived surface temperatures and a SSiB-derived retrieval equation, the retrieved soil moistures at the HAPEX-Mobilhy site generally closely approximate the conditions recorded on the ground.

The field experiment was carried out during the dry season in two regions of northern Australia with differing soils subject to seasonal inundation, one a heavy black cracking clay, the other solodic. 2. The distinction is drawn between causes of seed bank depletion - the external environmental factors resulting in losses of seed - and the processes of depletion death or germination - through which the various causes operate. 3. Overall, 66 and 59%, respectively, of seeds remained viable in the two regions after the 7 months of the dry season had elapsed. The causes of loss were diurnal temperature fluctuations of up to 50 degrees C and soil micro-organisms. Both caused germination and death of seeds in the seed bank, germination stimulated by temperature fluctuations being the more important. 4. Fungicide reduced the overall loss of seeds significantly in both regions, but only by 10-16%.

Little is known of the effects of grazing on crop microclimate, particularly the effects of defoliation on crown temperatures. Knowledge of such effects is important because temperature is the main factor underpinning crop ontogeny, and ontogeny drives dry matter allocation, leaf appearance rates and the timing of anthesis, which are key determinants of grain yield. The primary aim of this study was to examine the influence of grazing intensity and duration on the crown temperatures of winter wheat crops grown at Canberra, Australia. A secondary aim was to examine the association between crown temperature and phenology. In 2007, wheat cv. Mackellar was grazed at intensity-duration combinations of low-short (LS, 33 sheep/ha for 31 days), heavy-short (HS, 67 sheep/ha for 31 days) or low-long (LL, 33 sheep/ha for 62 days). In 2008, cvv. Mackellar and Naparoo were grazed at the HS intensity-duration. Cubic smoothing splines were fitted to crown temperature data measured between the end of grazing and anthesis to facilitate identification of long-term trends and statistical differences caused by the effects of defoliation on crown temperature. Grazing treatments with greater intensity or longer duration significantly elevated maximum daily crown temperature; differences of 6-78 degrees C were common in the month following grazing. Cubic-spline analysis showed that long-term trends in maximum crown temperature of the HS and LL treatments were significantly greater than corresponding temperatures of controls for the entire post-grazing duration. By contrast, effects of grazing on minimum diurnal crown temperature were small. Increasing biomass removal significantly delayed stem elongation and anthesis. We demonstrate that although initial phenological delays caused by defoliation are large, greater diurnal crown temperature fluctuation in grazed crops leads to greater growing degree-day accumulation between the end of grazing and anthesis. This increases the rate of thermal time accumulation during the post-grazing-anthesis period and is likely prominent in driving greater development rates of grazed crops. We further demonstrate that delays in phenology associated with grazing can be largely accounted for by a thermal time constant, with the LS, HS and LL treatments delaying stem elongation by similar to 52, 141 and 214 degree-days, respectively, above a base temperature of 0 degrees C. Results from these experiments and interpretations herein will be of use in designing crop-grazing regimes, and in studies examining implications of defoliation on vegetative microclimate and on physiological feedback effects caused by elevated temperature.",,,,,"Virgona, Jim/AAN-5705-2021; Harrison, Matthew/AAH-8915-2020; Harrison, Matthew T/D-4668-2013; Harrison, Matthew Tom/C-2434-2014","Harrison, Matthew/0000-0001-7425-452X; Harrison, Matthew T/0000-0001-7425-452X; Harrison, Matthew Tom/0000-0001-7425-452X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1836-0947,1836-5795,,,,,2015,66,3-4,,,,,235,248,,10.1071/CP13380,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP13380,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000352351000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Caterpillars showed distinct, highly synchronized activity bouts during which they left their tent, fed on their host-plant and returned to their tent. Caterpillars stayed almost inactive during their digestion phases when they rested inside or on the tent. The number of daily foraging bouts varied over a wide range. On warm and sunny days with high solar irradiation caterpillars left their tent up to 9 times, whereas there was only one foraging bout on cool and rainy days. On average, 4.8 daily foraging bouts were performed by fourth (prefinal) instar larvae, which is higher than the number reported for another well-known CPF species, the eastern tent caterpillar Malacosoma americanum. Overall, E. lanestris colonies required 31 +/- 2 foraging periods to pass their fourth instar within 7.3 +/- 1.2 days under the temperature conditions prevailing over the course of our experiment. The length of individual foraging bouts as well as the phase of digestion proved to be strongly temperature dependent. In contrast to patterns reported for M. americanum, foraging activities were not bound to specific times of day and also continued during night time if temperature permitted. Changes in light phases only had a modulatory effect on the onset of the next foraging bout. E. lanestris is the first lepidopteran species with CPF social caterpillars reported to show a plastic, but nevertheless strictly synchronized foraging pattern.

In the Northern Hemisphere, a species is likely to be living very close to its upper thermal tolerance limits at the southern limit of its biogeographic range. With global warming, this southern limit is expected to shift poleward. Moreover, intertidal ecosystems are expected to be especially strongly affected, mostly due to their large daily and seasonal variations in temperature and exposure. Hence, these are model systems in which to conduct experiments examining the ecological effects of climate change. In this study we determined the upper lethal thermal limits, for both air and water, of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis via laboratory experiments. Tolerances vary seasonally, with a difference between media of 0.7 degrees C in June and 4.8 degrees C in November, as well as a decrease with multiple exposures. Measured lethal limits were then compared to field measurements of environmental temperature and concurrent measurements of mortality rates. Field results indicate that mortality in the intertidal occurs at rates expected from laboratory responses to elevated temperature. Hindcasts, retrospective analyses of historical data, indicate that high rates of mortality have shifted 51 and 42 days earlier in Beaufort, North Carolina, and Oregon Inlet, North Carolina, respectively, between 1956 and 2007. The combined data suggest that the historical southern limit of M. edulis near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, is indeed the result of intolerance to high temperature, and that this range edge is shifting poleward in a manner indicative of global warming.",,,,,"Mieszkowska, Nova/U-8479-2019; Wethey, David S/K-8063-2014","Mieszkowska, Nova/0000-0002-9570-7759; Wethey, David S/0000-0002-2549-1606",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3185,1939-8697,,,,AUG,2009,217,1,,,,,73,85,,10.1086/BBLv217n1p73,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/BBLv217n1p73,,,,,,,,19679724,,,,,WOS:000269097400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Similarly, few have studied gross N transformation rates (mineralization, nitrification and immobilization) as an interactive unit. N cycling was examined in clover amended or unamended soil incubated under constant laboratory temperatures of 2, 5, 10 or 15 degreesC for 161 days. Under laboratory conditions we also examined the impact of a sudden change in soil temperature whereby amended soil previously incubated for 98 days at 2, 5 or 10 degreesC was subsequently incubated at 15 degreesC, while amended soil previously incubated at 15 degreesC was incubated at 2 degreesC for a further 63 days. The effect of fluctuating winter temperatures was studied using intact soil cores under winter field conditions for 35 days. The kinetics of N transformations were determined in the laboratory incubation and field experiment by measuring soil ammonium (NH4+-N) and nitrate (NO3--N) concentrations and gross rates of mineralization, nitrification and immobilization. The fate of N-15 labelled clover residue was also measured in the field experiment. In the laboratory incubation and field experiments, soil mineral-N concentration was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in amended, compared with unamended soil. Under laboratory conditions mineral-N concentration significantly (P < 0.05) increased with increasing incubation temperature in amended soil. In unamended soil, mineral-N concentration was significantly (P < 0.05) greater when incubated at 15 degreesC than at 2, 5 or 10 degreesC alone. Under winter field conditions all mineral-N released from clover residues was at risk of leaching during winter rainfall. Gross nitrification was initially (7-56 days) inhibited in amended soil incubated at 2 or 5 degreesC, causing an accumulation of NH4+-N. However, after 77 days at 2 or 5 degreesC, gross nitrification rates increased, such that NO3--N increased to concentrations which were greater than those of NH4+-N. This suggests that nitrifying bacteria took longer to acclimatize to the cold conditions than ammonifying microorganisms. Nitrate-N was the dominant form of mineral-N throughout the incubation experiment in amended soil incubated at 10 or 15 T. In unamended soil, gross immobilization rates generally followed the same pattern as gross mineralization rates throughout the incubation. Unamended soil incubated at 10 degreesC and below produced negligible NO3--N, indicating that N or carbon limited nitrification at these temperatures. Increasing incubation temperature from 2, 5 or 10 degreesC to 15 degreesC caused a rapid increase in soil NO3--N concentration and gross mineralization and nitrification rates, but significantly (P < 0.05) less mineral-N was released than if incubated at a constant 15 T. This suggests that intermediate substrates may have been depleted during the initial incubation period at 2, 5 or 10 degreesC, hence limiting mineralizable-N. Decreasing soil temperature from 15 to 2 degreesC caused an initial increase in mineral-N, which was quickly followed by rapid immobilization of mineral-N; gross immobilization rates were up to 2.8 fold greater than gross mineralization rates. Similarly, under field conditions, microbial biomass N and gross immobilization increased with decreasing soil temperature suggesting there was population growth of adapting micro-flora. The release of mineral-N from clover residues in the incubation experiment also seemed to occur in two-phases, interpreted as first the mineralization of the labile and then the more recalcitrant fractions of the residues. This research has shown that significant mineral-N is released from soil amended with clover residues at temperatures as low as 2 degreesC. Therefore, the incorporation of N-rich plant material should be delayed until spring to avoid winter N leaching. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The time and temperature combinations required to achieve 100% mortality of field-collected, cold-acclimated P. interpunctella larvae obtained from laboratory mortality experiments were used to develop the mortality model. Accumulation of mortality rate over time was called the cumulative lethality index (CLI). Complete mortality of insect populations would occur when CLI equals 1. Observed mortality of field-collected, cold-acclimated P. interpunctella larvae in five 76.2-T (3,000-bu) shelled corn bins located in Rosemount, MN, during the winters of 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 were used to validate the CLI model (i.e., mortality model). Excellent agreement between predicted and measured time to 100% larval mortality was observed. The CLI model would be useful for developing low-temperature aeration management strategies for controlling overwintering P. interpunctella in grain bins. In addition, this model will be useful when determining if additional control measures will be required as a result of above-seasonal ambient temperatures.",,,,,"Kells, Stephen/GYU-9455-2022; Kaliyan, Nalladurai/D-1332-2011","Kaliyan, Nalladurai/0000-0003-3894-5328",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,,,,,DEC,2007,36,6,,,,,1318,1327,,10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36[1318:MOIMLP]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2007)36[1318:MOIMLP]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,18284759,,,,,WOS:000252060700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Diurnal monitoring of chlorophyll fluorescence, under 2 different flow regimes (< 3 and 20 cm s(-1) flow rates) in an outdoor aquarium, showed reduced photoinhibition, but only under moderate flow conditions (20 cm s-1). Experimental (laboratory) measurements, on time scales ranging from minutes to hours, showed that flow-mediated reductions in photoinhibition occurred not by enhancing recovery of the damaged photosystem, but rather through inducing differential photodamage. Moreover, experiments involving sequential light oscillations (500/20 and 1000/20 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) at 3 flow regimes, < 3, 10, and 20 cm s(-1), on a time scale ranging from hours to days, revealed water-velocity-dependent reductions of dynamic photoinhibition.

After three weeks of age, the ambient temperature was adjusted to daily fluctuations between 24 degrees C and 38(sic)C, simulating diurnal temperature during heat stress (HS). From day one, all birds were divided into 3 treatments, with 6 replicates of 10 birds each. The birds were fed a corn-soybean meal basal diet (control) or the same diet supplemented with 250 mg/kg GEO (diet GEO) or 200 mg/kg CuSO4 (diet CuSO4). Feeding diet GEO decreased (P = 0.003) average daily gain (ADG), but increased (P = 0.018) feed conversion ratio (FCR) at 1 -21 day period. However, all diets resulted in no significant change (P > 0.05) in body weight at 42 days and average daily feed intake, ADG and FCR in the second (days 22-42) and the overall (days 1-42) experimental period. The use of CuSO4 enhanced (P < 0.05) the plasma albumin and Cu concentrations, but decreased (P = 0.005) blood uric acid level compared to the control diet. Dietary GEO also decreased (P < 0.01) the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Both supplementation of CuSO4 and GEO reduced (P = 0.023) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.026) when compared to the control group. In contrast, no diets affected (P > 0.05) the values of plasma total protein and globulin.

Simultaneously, ongoing climate change is modifying ecosystems and will have far-reaching impacts on the structure and function of ecological communities. Rising surface temperatures are predicted to have negative effects on plants and animals, but such predictions are typically broad and poorly matched to the spatial scale at which most organisms experience the environment. Microclimate thermal regimes are often moderated by land-cover, and intensive forest management practices have the potential to either ameliorate or exacerbate climate change effects on biota. In this study, we examined the degree to which air temperature varied across an experimental gradient of herbicide application intensity within early-seral forests in the Coast Range mountains of western Oregon. We evaluated stand-level air temperatures in regenerating stands subjected to light, moderate, and intensive herbicide treatments, as well as a no-spray control. We examined whether daily temperature measurements (minimum, mean, and maximum) and their associated coefficients of variation were influenced by herbicide treatments. We found that herbicide treatments had some influence on mean and maximum air temperatures, but not on minimum temperature or on measures of temperature variability. However, temperature effects were small (< 0.5 degrees C), the direction of these effects were inconsistent, and pairwise contrasts often failed to detect significant differences after accounting for multiple comparisons. Our results suggest that post-harvest vegetation management has limited impacts on fine-scale air temperatures and is unlikely to either amplify or buffer the projected effects of climate change within early-seral forests.",,,,,"Betts, Matthew G/Q-2978-2019","Betts, Matthew G/0000-0002-7100-2551",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-344X,2161-9859,,,,MAY,2018,92,2,,,,,107,118,,10.3955/046.092.0204,http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.092.0204,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000438571800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Environment-by-embryo interactions are particularly consequential for species with temperature-dependent sex determination, a mode of sex determination common in non-avian reptiles and fish, in which thermal cues during a discrete period of development drive the formation of either an ovary or a testis. Here we examine the impact of thermal variation during incubation in combination with developmental exposure to a common endocrine-disrupting contaminant on fitness-related hatchling traits in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination. Using a factorial design, we exposed field-collected eggs to five thermal profiles (three constant temperatures, two fluctuating temperatures) and two environmentally relevant doses of the pesticide metabolite dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene; and we quantified incubation duration, sex ratios, hatchling morphometric traits, and growth (9-10 days post-hatch). Whereas dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene exposure did not generally affect hatchling traits, constant and fluctuating temperatures produced diverse phenotypic effects. Thermal fluctuations led to subtle changes in incubation duration and produced shorter hatchlings with smaller heads when compared to the constant temperature control. Warmer, male-promoting incubation temperatures resulted in larger hatchlings with more residual yolk reserves when compared to cooler, female-promoting temperatures. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how complex environmental factors interact with developing organisms to generate phenotypic variation and raise questions regarding the mechanisms connecting variable thermal conditions to responses in hatchling traits and their evolutionary implications for temperature-dependent sex determination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3185,1939-8697,,,,AUG 1,2021,241,1,,,,,43,54,,10.1086/714572,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/714572,,AUG 2021,,,,,,34436964,,,,,WOS:000659233500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Spectral levels in the -2/3 range varied with g, and the spectrum width was a function of x. The wavelength of the spectral peak decreased as -xi (>0) increased. The variation of spectral level in the inertial subrange suggested that dissipation due to wave breaking was enhanced by a factor of 1.7 at 2-m depth for a wind speed of 10 m s(-1). Root-mean-square temperature fluctuations at 2-m depth versus -xi were in excellent agreement with atmospheric surface layer observations and agreed moderately well ( within 30%) with the results of large-eddy simulation experiments. Root-mean-square fluctuations were proportional to (-xi)(-1/3) for -xi > 0.4, consistent with the predictions of similarity theory. The skewness of temperature fluctuations varied with -xi, qualitatively similar to variation in the atmospheric surface layer.

This might alter the greenhouse gas balance and significantly reduce the carbon sink potential of tropical seagrass meadows. In order to assess such consequences, we simulated temperature stress during low tide exposures by subjecting seagrass plants (Thalassia hemprichii) and associated sediments to elevated midday temperature spikes (31, 35, 37, 40, and 45 degrees C) for seven consecutive days in an outdoor mesocosm setup. During the experiment, methane release from the sediment surface was estimated using gas chromatography. Sulfide concentration in the sediment pore water was determined spectrophotometrically, and the plant's photosynthetic capacity as electron transport rate (ETR), and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) was assessed using pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry. The highest temperature treatments (40 and 45 degrees C) had a clear positive effect on methane emission and the level of sulfide in the sediment and, at the same time, clear negative effects on the photosynthetic performance of seagrass plants. The effects observed by temperature stress were immediate (within hours) and seen in all response variables, including ETR, Fv/Fm, methane emission, and sulfide levels. In addition, both the methane emission and the size of the sulfide pool were already negatively correlated with changes in the photosynthetic rate (ETR) during the first day, and with time, the correlations became stronger. These findings show that increased temperature will reduce primary productivity and increase methane and sulfide levels. Future increases in the frequency and severity of extreme temperature events could hence reduce the climate mitigation capacity of tropical seagrass meadows by reducing CO2 sequestration, increase damage from sulfide toxicity, and induce the release of larger amounts of methane.",,,,,"Lyimo, Thomas/ABC-1507-2020; Björk, Mats/B-4299-2010","Björk, Mats/0000-0003-0363-110X; George, Rushingisha/0000-0002-2793-2970",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,FEB,2020,10,4,,,,,1917,1928,,10.1002/ece3.6009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6009,,FEB 2020,,,,,,32128125,,,,,WOS:000511019900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this experiment was to compare sap flow and canopy temperature (T-c) measurements with more classical methods like psi(s) or g(s) to predict the effect of deficit irrigation on fresh fruit weight in citrus trees. The experiment was performed during the summer of 2011 in a Clementina de Nules orchard undergoing RDI. Sap flow was determined by means of the compensation heat pulse method in well-watered and RDI trees. T-c was measured continuously with infrared thermometers (IRTs) mounted over the canopies and also weekly with an infrared hand-operated thermographic camera taking frontal images of the sunlit side of tree crowns. Concurrently psi(s) and g(s) were also measured on all trees. Results showed that the evolution of the relative transpiration obtained with the sap flow sensors was in agreement with the plant water stress experienced. The values of T-c obtained with the fixed IRTs, normalized by air temperature (T-c - T-a) were in general poorly related with psi(s) and g(s). However, when T-c was obtained from thermal imaging, there was a good correlation with psi(s) in days of relatively high water stress (i.e. when psi(s) differences among treatments were >1.0 MPa). The average fruit weight at harvest was significantly correlated with all the stress indicators, and the best correlation was that of thermographic followed by psi(s) and g(s). Overall, results showed that in citrus trees T-c measurement obtained from thermal imaging is a good tool to predict the effect of water deficit on fresh fruit weight. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Eggs incubated at fluctuating temperatures exhibited surprisingly high hatching success and also produced large and well-performed hatchlings in spite of the extremely wide range of temperatures (11.6-36.2 degrees C) they experienced. This means that exposure of eggs to adversely low or high temperatures for short periods does not increase embryonic mortality. The variance of fluctuating temperatures affected hatchling morphology and locomotor performance more evidently than did the mean of the temperatures in this case.

Moreover, accurate measurement of temperature under high pressure environment using Rayleigh Brillouin scattering is of great significance to monitoring of Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Preburner and the scramjet engine. Both the deconvolution method and the convolution method are used to achieve the temperature retrieving of air under different pressures based on the spontaneous Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering. And the reasons induced the temperature retrival error are studied and a comparison of temperature measurement between the two methods is made. Before the deconvolution method based on Wiener filterbeing performed on the measured spectrum directly, the convolved spectra between the spontaneous Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering model and instrument transmission function are deconvolved to obtain the deconvolved spectra and the decovolved spectra are compared with the theoretical calculation spectra to retrieve temperatures. And the optimized singular value stacking number being 150, which is the key parameter of the deconvolution method, is obtained on account of temperature retriecal error being less than 1. 0 K, the relatively unobvious fitting error and the short time consumption of retrieving temperature. And the spontaneous Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering spectra of air induced by the wavelength of 532nm of laser under the pressure of 1 similar to 7 bar at the temperature of 294. 0 K are measured in experiment and the optimized scattering angle of 90. 7 degrees is obtained by the combination of theoretical spectrum and the principle of minimum value of chi(2). After that, the deconvolution method and the convolution method are used to retrieve temperatures severally. Experiment results demonstrate that the spectral resolution is improved by using deconvolution method to some extent. Meanwhile, both the deconvolution method and the convolution method have good performance on temperature measurement under different pressures and the maximum errors between the retrieved temperature and the reference temperature are less than 2. 0 K, temperature retrieving results of the deconvolution method are improved and time consumption of retrieving temperature is reduced with the pressure increasing, and temperature retrieving results using convolution method are better than those using the deconvolution method when the air pressure is low (<= 2 bar), however, the results of both methods are close to each other and the absolute temperature errorsareless than 1. 0K when the air pressure is high (>2 bar). By analysis, it is found that the factors causing the temperature retrieval errors for both methods include the temperature fluctuations (+/- 0. 2 K), the effect of uncertainty of scattering angle and the known parameters on temperature retrieving and the spectral disturbancescaused by the nonlinear amplification of spectral noise of deconvolution method. The parameter measurement result can be improved in experiment by improving the signal-to-noise ratio of measured spectrum, the accuracy of optimized scattering angle and the deconvolution method.",,,,,"Wu, Tao/AAO-1567-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-0593,,,,,OCT,2019,39,10,,,,,2998,3006,,10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2019)10-2998-09,http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2019)10-2998-09,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000496898700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

A change in temperature means an alteration in the respiration rate of the product and in the gas transmission rates through the film. Because of their high metabolic activity, minimally processed products are particularly sensitive to temperature variation, and hence this study has been carried out with five cultivars of fresh-cut peaches (Prunus persica). Their respiratory activity has been determined by a closed system at 4, 15, and 25 degrees C. The peach segments are wrapped in microperforated films whose transmission rate is determined according to the size of the microperforations (between 100 x 130 mu m and 215 x 190 mu m). To quantify the effect of temperature fluctuations (5h at 25 degrees C) on the O-2 and CO2 concentrations of the packaging atmosphere of the product, a mathematical model has been applied. Using experimental data, it has been established that the rate of O-2 consumption is a potential function of the O-2 concentration, while the production of CO2 is linear. Although, all cultivars are of nonmelting fresh with no big differences in respiratory activity; these differences are accentuated with O-2 concentrations greater than 10% and raising the temperature. The solution of the model provides knowledge of the behavior of the product during its nonstationary period and equilibrium once reached. The results show in all cases that the CO2 concentration is more sensitive (increase of 5 units) to it break in the cold chain than that of O-2 (reduction of 2 units).",,,,,"Valdenegro, Monika/G-3791-2012; Buesa, Jaime Gonzalez/C-7413-2012","Buesa, Jaime Gonzalez/0000-0003-4147-3616; Salvador Solano, Maria Luisa/0000-0001-6013-3399",,,,,,,,,,,,,1082-0132,1532-1738,,,,OCT,2008,14,,,5,,,109,116,,10.1177/1082013208095326,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1082013208095326,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000263675300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

A longer measurement duration reduced values for all variables for all start times, and this was an effect of reduced animal activity rather than random sampling. However, there was also an effect of circadian rhythm on the timing of minimal physiological values. Experiment start time had a significant effect on time taken to reach minimal values for all variables, ranging from 0400 hours +/- A 38 min (body temperature, start time 2300 hours) to 0854 hours +/- A 52 min (evaporative water loss, start time 1700 hours). It also influenced the time of day that minimal values were obtained, ranging from 2224 hours +/- A 40 min (carbon dioxide production, start time 1500 hours) to 0600 hours +/- A 57 min (oxygen consumption, start time 2300 hours), and the minimum values measured. Consequently, both the measurement duration and the experiment start time should be considered in experimental design to account for both a handling and a circadian effect on the animal's physiology.

We used experimental evolution to determine how metabolism evolves in populations of Drosophila melanogaster exposed to one of three selective treatments: a constant 16 degrees C, a constant 25 degrees C, or temporal fluctuations between 16 and 25 degrees C. We tested August Krogh's controversial hypothesis that colder environments select for a faster metabolism. Given that colder environments also experience greater seasonality, we also tested the hypothesis that temporal variation in temperature may be the factor that selects for a faster metabolism. We measured the metabolic rate of flies from each selective treatment at 16, 20.5, and 25 degrees C. Although metabolism was faster at higher temperatures, flies from the selective treatments had similar metabolic rates at each measurement temperature. Based on variation among genotypes within populations, heritable variation in metabolism was likely sufficient for adaptation to occur. We conclude that colder or seasonal environments do not necessarily select for a faster metabolism.

Mean in situ egg production rate increased with ambient chlorophyll-a concentration, ranging from 0 to 47 eggs female(-1) d(-1), while no diurnal synchronous spawning behavior was observed. Under the spring bloom condition, E. bungii showed prey preference for less mobile and larger-sized prey (a parts per thousand yen30 mu m ESD) and bloom-forming diatom Thalassiosira spp. accounted for > 80% of ingested carbon. In the laboratory, E. bungii was successfully reared from newly hatched nauplii to adult with the diatom, Thalassiosira nordenskioldi, as a food resource. Nauplii newly hatched from eggs reached the adult stage in ca. 150 days (5A degrees C) with a sigmoidal developmental pattern and no sexual difference in development pattern. Starvation experiments indicated that the starved copepodids (C1-C4) became more vulnerable to high temperature with the progression of developmental stage, suggesting that the post-bloom condition with low food availability and increased temperature is harsh for their copepodids. The results of this study in conjunction with previous findings suggest that E. bungii is well adapted to utilize large-sized phytoplankton, such as a bloom-forming diatoms and, therefore, their recruitment processes, including egg production, development and mortality would be strongly affected by the duration and intensity of the spring bloom.",,,,,"Takahashi, Kazutaka/AAM-6305-2020","Takahashi, Kazutaka/0000-0002-5846-0240",,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-8158,1573-5117,,,,MAY,2011,666,1,,,,,99,109,,10.1007/s10750-010-0093-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0093-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000289002100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Winter survival is believed to be the single most important life-history trait in long-lived species but its determinants are largely unknown. Seabirds are inaccessible during this season, so conventional metabolic studies are extremely challenging and new approaches are needed. This paper describes and uses a state-of-the-art mechanistic model, Niche Mapper (TM), to predict energy expenditure and food requirements of the two main seabird species wintering in the northwest Atlantic. We found that energy demand increased throughout the winter phase in both species. Across this period, mean estimated daily energy requirements were 1306 kJ day(-1) for Brunnich's guillemots (Uria lomvia) and 430 kJ day(-1) for little auks (Alle alle) wintering off Greenland and Newfoundland. Mean estimated daily food requirements were 547 g wet food day(-1) for Brunnich's guillemots, and 289 g wet food day(-1) for little auks. For both species and both wintering sites, our model predicts a sharp increase in energy expenditure between November and December, primarily driven by climatic factors such as air temperature and wind speed. These findings strongly suggest the existence of an energetic bottleneck for North Atlantic seabirds towards the end of the year, a challenging energetic phase which might explain recurrent events of winter mass-mortality, so called 'seabird winter wrecks'. Our study therefore emphasizes the relevance of thermodynamics/biophysical modelling for investigating the energy balance of wintering marine top predators and its interplay with survival and population dynamics in the context of global change.",,,,,"Gremillet, David/W-1946-2018; Fort, Jerome/F-1157-2016","Gremillet, David/0000-0002-7711-9398; Fort, Jerome/0000-0002-0860-6707",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,AUG 1,2009,212,15,,,,,2483,2490,,10.1242/jeb.032300,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.032300,,,,,,,,19617442,,,,,WOS:000268136700030,View Full Record in Web of Science

During the stratified season, the deep offshore cold (dense) water, when shoaled into shallow water along the bottom, was often trapped for a few hours and dissipated in the nearshore region (water depth of 10-20 m) during the ebb phase of the diurnal surface tide. It appears that perturbations propagating onshore along the shoaled isopycnals can form an upslope surging front and an internal bolus. Our data allow the application of theoretical/lab criteria for internal hydraulic jumps, internal bolus formation, and internal wave breaking and all criteria are fulfilled during a part of the tidal shoaling cycle. Nonlinear advection associated with the internal boluses causes higher (close to omega(-3)) spectral falloff rate of near-bottom temperature with frequency omega than the canonical Garret-Munk spectra (omega(-2)) in the range of 0.1-1.0 cph, implying strong scattering of tidal energy toward smaller scales. We are able to directly calculate the offshore eddy heat flux by cold water intrusion onto the shelf resulting from this process.

It produces egos throughout the year with two seasonal peaks in summer and winter, respectively. Uncertainty exists with regard to the relative importance of the two egg production seasons for the mass invasion of juvenile recruits of 10-20 mm length in May/June, which is the dominant seasonal signal in the German and Dutch Wadden Sea, and which is presumed to grow into the exploitable stock by the autumn, causing the typical rise of commercial catches at that time of the year. A simulation model was developed that predicts the daily abundance of juvenile recruits attaining a given length, typically in the range of 10-20 mm. The model uses: (i) experimental data on the development times of eggs and larvae and the growth rates of juveniles; (ii) field data on the seasonal temperature cycle in different years (1986, 1992 and 1993 or mean conditions) and areas (German and Dutch Wadden Sea) of the North Sea; and (iii) a calculated index of the relative seasonal egg production intensity of adult C. crangon. Predictions of the simulations are compared with field observations on the seasonal occurrence of juvenile recruits in the German and Dutch Wadden Sea. Using temperature data from German waters, in the simulations peak recruitment was predicted to occur 1-2 months later than that observed in the field. However, if seasonal temperature data from Dutch waters were used, the predicted time of the first mass occurrence of recruits matched the field observations more closely. Simulations revealed that the first mass invasion of juveniles originates almost entirely from the winter egg production.

There was a wide range of fertilizer inputs at each site. Rates of denitrification were estimated by a coring and field incubation technique using acetylene to inhibit the reduction of N2O to N2. Major features of the detailed results from two of the sites were: (i) the large ranges in rates of loss, (ii) the relatively low contributions to total annual loss during autumn and winter, (iii) the apparent association of high rates of loss with fertilizer additions made when the soil was wet or immediately preceding a rainfall event, and (iv) significant losses from soil at 10-30 cm in the profile. Multiple quadratic regression analysis of the effects of soil NO3--N, soil temperature and water was used to explain variability in rates of loss. When separate regressions were fitted within each site x year x season x fertilizer level subset, 51% of the variation in loss was explained on a poorly drained fine loam/silt but only 38% on a freely drained loam.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,1573-5036,,,,FEB,1991,131,1,,,,,77,88,,10.1007/BF00010422,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00010422,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991EZ29300009,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Zhang, C; Liu, Z",,,,"Zhang, Chao; Liu, Zhen",,,Freezing of water confined in porous materials: role of adsorption and unfreezable threshold,ACTA GEOTECHNICA,,,,,,,,,,,,"It has been widely accepted in scientific communities that water confined in porous materials gradually freezes from large pores to small pores at subfreezing temperatures (<0 degrees C), though we still describe a soil as frozen or unfrozen in engineering practice and daily life. Therefore, it is more accurate to say how frozen instead of whether frozen. This gradual freezing process is temperature-dependent because water in pores of different sizes has different energy levels, which requires different temperatures for its phase transition, leading to a relationship between unfrozen water content and temperature in soils. However, the understanding of this relationship, i.e., the Phase Composition Curves (PCC), is still incomplete, especially in the low-temperature range. We still lack answers to even the most fundamental questions for frozen soils and their PCCs: (1) How much pore water could be frozen? (2) How do capillarity and adsorption control the freezing of pore water? This study investigates two basic physical mechanisms, i.e., unfreezable threshold and adsorption, for their dominant roles in the low-temperature range of the PCC. To quantify the effects of the unfreezable threshold, molecular dynamics simulation was employed to identify the unfreezable threshold of cylindrical pores. The simulation results, for the first time, revealed that the unfreezable threshold corresponds to a pore diameter of 2.3 +/- 0.1nm and is independent of the wettability of the solid substrates. Combining this unfreezable threshold with a modified Gibbs-Thomson equation, a mathematical model was proposed to predict the melting temperature in pores of different sizes, which considers both unfreezable threshold and adsorption. Comparisons of the results calculated with the new model and other two conventional equations against experimental results indicated that the model can improve conventional equations which have been used for centuries by including the two mechanisms, which significantly improved our understanding of frozen soils.",,,,,"Zhang, Chao/ABG-8379-2021","Liu, Zhen/0000-0001-8013-3804; Zhang, Chao/0000-0002-6675-3940",,,,,,,,,,,,,1861-1125,1861-1133,,,,OCT,2018,13,5,,,,,1203,1213,,10.1007/s11440-018-0637-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11440-018-0637-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000443969100012,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is unknown to what extent sow fertility and piglet survival are affected under moderate climatic conditions in indoor systems. Therefore, this study estimated effects of temperature and temperature-humidity index (THI) on sow fertility and piglet survival under practical husbandry conditions. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded in six piglet-producing farms in Lower Saxony, Germany, from July 2011 to August 2012. Based on that, the THI was calculated. In one farrowing, waiting and servicing unit of each farm two data loggers were installed. Reproductive parameters of 8279 successful inseminations and 10 369 litters including total number of piglets born, liveborn, stillborn and weaned piglets as well as pre-weaning mortality were evaluated. The effects of temperature and THI on reproductive parameters were estimated for varying periods after breeding and before and after farrowing, respectively. Average daily temperature across all units ranged from 15.6 degrees C to 29.0 degrees C, and average THI from 62.4 to 75.1. Season and parity significantly affected total number of piglets born, number of liveborn, stillborn and weaned piglets (P < 0.001). The number of piglets born increased with rising temperature and THI in the 1st week post breeding. Higher temperatures and THI values before farrowing resulted in a reduced number of liveborn piglets. Elevated temperature and THI values after farrowing were associated with a greater number of weaned piglets. The pre-weaning mortality significantly decreased with increasing temperature and THI values after farrowing (P < 0.05). In conclusion, temperature and THI affected the reproductive performance of the sows and the survival of the piglets in different ways. While increased climatic values at the time of breeding positively affected the total number of piglets born, increased values at the time of farrowing had negative impacts on the reproductive performance of the sows. Piglets benefited from higher temperature and THI values after farrowing.",,,,,"Lambertz, Christian/AAJ-9769-2020; Daş, Gürbüz/A-8403-2011; Reiner, Gerald/A-2879-2015","Daş, Gürbüz/0000-0001-6690-0050; Gauly, Matthias/0000-0003-4212-5437",,,,,,,,,,,,,1751-7311,1751-732X,,,,SEP,2014,8,9,,,,,1526,1533,,10.1017/S1751731114001219,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1751731114001219,,,,,,,,24846319,,,,,WOS:000342219000016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ammonium excretion rate of juveniles acclimated to 20, 24, 28 and 32 degreesC was measured. Fluctuating salinity levels were applied to these animals in a sequence of 40 parts per thousand, 33, 25, 18, 11, 18, 25, 33 and back to 40 parts per thousand. The results indicate that when the salinity was reduced from 40 to 11 parts per thousand the ammonium excretion of the shrimp was reduced. The osmotic concentration of the animals was hyposmotic as the salinity decreased from 40 to 25 parts per thousand, hyperosmotic during the 18-11-18 in V. interval and hyposmotic as the salinity increased from 25 to 40 parts per thousand again. The range of isomotic points over this range of salinity was 712-777 mmol Kg(-1). The ammonium excretion of P. vannamei exposed to these experimental conditions can be attributed to the process of osmoregulation because excretion was increased when the shrimp were hyper-regulating and reduced when they were hypo-regulating. Based on our results, the animals experience the lowest stress in a temperature between 27 to 30 degreesC and a salinity close to the isosmotic, point between 25-27 parts per thousand.

Empirical evidence increasingly shows that short episodes of high temperature experienced around flowering can have large negative impacts on cereal grain yields, a phenomenon increasingly referred to as heat stress. Crop models are currently the best tools available to investigate how crops will grow under future climatic conditions, though the need to include heat stress effects has been recognized only relatively recently. We reviewed literature on both how key crop physiological processes and the observed yields under production conditions are impacted by high temperatures occurring particularly in the flowering and grain filling phases for wheat, maize and rice. This state of the art in crop response to heat stress was then contrasted with generic approaches to simulate the impacts of high temperatures in crop growth models. We found that the observed impacts of heat stress on crop yield are the end result of the integration of many processes, not all of which will be affected by a high temperature regime. This complexity confirms an important role for crop models in systematizing the effects of high temperatures on many processes under a range of environments and realizations of crop phenology. Four generic approaches to simulate high temperature impacts on yield were identified: (1) empirical reduction of final yield, (2) empirical reduction in daily increment in harvest index, (3) empirical reduction in grain number, and (4) semi-deterministic models of sink and source limitation. Consideration of canopy temperature is suggested as a promising approach to concurrently account for heat and drought stress, which are likely to occur simultaneously. Improving crop models' response to high temperature impacts on cereal yields will require experimental data representative of field production and should be designed to connect what is already known about physiological responses and observed yield impacts.

We examined the responses of R (S), heterotrophic respiration (R (H)), autotrophic respiration (R (A)), nitrogen (N) availability, and fine-root biomass to increased temperature in an open-field soil warming experiment. The experiment was conducted in a cool-temperate deciduous forest ecosystem in northern Japan. As this forest is subjected to strong temporal variation in temperature, on scales ranging from daily to seasonal, we also investigated the temporal variation in the effects of soil warming on R (S), R (H), and R (A). Soil temperature was continuously elevated by about 4.0A degrees C from 2007 to 2014 using heating wires buried in the soil, and we measured soil respiratory processes in all four seasons from 2012 to 2014. Soil warming increased annual R (S) by 32-45%, but the magnitude of the increase was different between the components: R (H) and R (A) were also stimulated, and increased by 39-41 and 17-18%, respectively. Soil N availability during the growing season and fine-root biomass were not remarkably affected by the warming treatment. We found that the warming effects varied seasonally. R (H) increased significantly throughout the year, but the warming effect showed remarkable seasonal differences, with the maximum stimulation in the spring. This suggests that warmer spring temperature will produce a greater increase in CO2 release than warmer summer temperatures. In addition, we found that soil warming reduced the temperature sensitivity (Q (10)) of R (S). Although the Q (10) of both R (H) and R (A) tended to be reduced, the decrease in the Q (10) of R (S) was caused mainly by a decrease in the response of R (A) to warming. These long-term results indicate that a balance between the rapid and large response of soil microbes and the acclimation of plant roots both play important roles in determining the response of R (S) to soil warming, and must be carefully considered to predict the responses of soil C dynamics under future temperature conditions.",,,,,"Saitoh, Taku M/G-8436-2011; Hiura, Tsutom/S-7395-2017","Saitoh, Taku M/0000-0003-4667-9736; Hiura, Tsutom/0000-0002-6735-1935",,,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,APR,2016,19,3,,,,,504,520,,10.1007/s10021-015-9948-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-015-9948-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000373018200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Trade-offs that arise from this migration have already attracted much attention and the cold temperature in the hypolimnion is thought to be the main cost of this behaviour. In this study we additionally looked at the extra costs daphnids have from being exposed to a fluctuating temperature regime (cold during the day and warm during the night) which is less well studied until today. In our experiment Daphnia hyalina Leydig and Daphnia magna Straus either spent 24 h in constant warm water (19 degrees C), 24 h in constant cold water (12 degrees C), or spent 12 h in warm and 12 h in cold water in an alternating way (fluctuating temperature regime). We expected the values of the life history parameters of Daphnia in the fluctuating temperature regime to be exactly halfway between the values of the life history parameters in the warm and cold treatments because the daphnids spent exactly half of the time in warm water, and half of the time in cold water. Concordant with earlier studies our results showed that age at first reproduction and egg development time were reduced at higher temperatures. In the fluctuating temperature regime the values of both parameters were exactly halfway between the values at permanently warm and cold temperature regimes. In contrast, somatic growth was higher at higher temperatures but was lower in the fluctuating temperature regime than expected from the mean somatic growth rate. This suggests that a fluctuating temperature regime experienced by migrating daphnids in stratified lakes involves additional costs for the daphnids.",,,,,"Reichwaldt, Elke/A-4046-2012; Wolf, Isabelle/V-1373-2017","Wolf, Isabelle/0000-0002-9573-3017; Reichwaldt, Elke/0000-0003-1234-5658",,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-8158,,,,,JUL 15,2005,543,,,,,,199,205,,10.1007/s10750-004-7451-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-7451-x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000231958400017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temporary fishery closures in response to population declines should be based on a thorough understanding of the magnitude of winter mortality. We used three methods to estimate the low-temperature tolerance of Spotted Seatrout: the chronic lethal method (CLM) and the acclimated chronic exposure (ACE) method using both static and fluctuating temperatures. All three methods use an environmentally realistic temperature change of 1 degrees C/d. Fish acclimated to 14 degrees C (n = 24) for 10 d and subsequently exposed to constantly declining temperatures using the CLM experienced loss of equilibrium at a temperature of 3.57 +/- 0.24 degrees C (mean +/- SD) and mortality at a temperature of 3.08 +/- 0.31 degrees C. The ACE method, which uses changing temperatures until a base temperature is reached, was used to evaluate how Spotted Seatrout are affected by prolonged, sublethal temperatures. The ACE method was performed with static and fluctuating temperatures at two base temperatures (5.25 degrees C and 4.25 degrees C). Fish exposed to static temperatures of 5.25 degrees C (n = 46) and 4.25 degrees C (n = 46) had significantly different survival rates (P < 0.001) and 4% and 91% mortality, respectively. Temperature fluctuations around a 5.25 degrees C base temperature did not significantly affect loss of equilibrium or mortality compared with the static treatment at 5.25 degrees C. Temperature fluctuations at the 4.25 degrees C base temperature did not cause greater mortality, but did cause fish to lose equilibrium significantly faster than in the static treatment (P < 0.001). Results of this study suggest that temperatures below 5 degrees C should be cause for concern for this species, though the duration of cold temperatures and the spatial distribution of temperature conditions will determine the severity of a winter mortality event. These data can be used to develop predictive mortality estimates for juvenile Spotted Seatrout (175-220 mm).",,,,,"Arnott, Stephen/D-1014-2013","Arnott, Stephen/0000-0003-0761-709X; Anweiler, Katie/0000-0002-9344-0691",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,2014,143,4,,,,,999,1010,,10.1080/00028487.2014.911203,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2014.911203,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000338728600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

A laboratory study was undertaken to assess the effects of these temperature fluctuations on sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) growth and metabolism. In a factorial design, scallops were subjected to constant (10 degrees C) or a variable (6 to 15 degrees C) 8 d temperature cycle, and either a low (seston in filtered seawater) or high (seston supplemented with cultured phytoplankton) food diet. During the 48 d experiment scallop mortality was low and growth positive in all treatments. Shell and total tissue growth rate did not differ between temperature treatments, but growth in the high food treatments was 40 to 50% higher than in the low food treatments. However, soft tissue (excluding adductor) growth did show a temperature treatment effect; growth rates were significantly higher in the fluctuating temperature treatment, due in part to greater gonad development. Weight-standardized rates of scallop oxygen consumption (VsO2, mu mol O-2 g(-1) h(-1)) were 20 to 25% higher in high food than in low food treatments, consistent with the expected increase in respiration due to the higher growth rates. Scallop metabolism did not acclimate to the fluctuating temperature cycle; VsO2 and ammonium excretion (VsNH4+, mu mol O-2 g(-1) h(-1)) remained dependent on ambient temperature throughout the experiment. VsNH4+ Q(10) (2.77) was higher than VsO2 Q(10) (2.01) which was reflected in a decrease in the O:N ratio at 15 degrees C, indicating a shift toward increased protein catabolism and a stressed state. At 10 degrees C, VsO2 and VsNH4+ in the variable temperature treatments were 15 to 18% lower than in the constant temperature treatments, a difference that was not detected in growth measurements. Results demonstrate that the metabolism of Placopecten magellanicus, unlike some bivalve species, is tightly coupled to fluctuations in ambient temperature.

Five experimental plots including one fallow field were established at the experimental farm of Barayev Kazakh Research and Production Center of Grain Farming, Shortandy, northern Kazakhstan (mean annual precipitation and average year temperature are 323 mm and 1.6degreesC, respectively). Mean daily soil temperature increased to above 0degreesC in early April, remaining at above 20degreesC from mid-June to mid-August, and then sharply decreased to below 5degreesC at the end of September. Most of the biological activities were considered to be limited from April to September. On the other hand, the soil moisture content remained high after thawing until mid-June and then continuously decreased in the cropped plots except during the rainfall events. The soil respiration rate recorded the highest values from late June to early July and overall fluctuations were similar to those of the soil temperature, unlike the fluctuations of soil microbial C and N contents, which exhibited similar patterns to those of the soil moisture content. In order to, represent the daily soil respiration rates using the soil environmental factors, the following relationship was introduced as a model function: Cem = aM(b)exp(-E/RT). The coefficients, a, b, and E (activation energy in Arrbenius equation), were determined by stepwise multiple regression after logarithm transformation using the measured data, Cem (daily soil respiration rate), M (volumetric soil moisture content), and T (absolute soil temperature). As a result, a significant relationship was always obtained between the soil respiration rate and the activation energy, E, while the contribution of the soil moisture content to the soil respiration rate was uncertain. Using the regression equations and monitored data of soil temperature and moisture content, cumulative soil respiration throughout the cropping period was calculated to be in the range of 2.5 to 3.2 Mg C ha(-1). On the other hand, the amounts of crop residues in the cropped plots that were expected to be incorporated into the soils ranged from 1.6 to 4.4 Mg C ha-1. Except for the plot planted with oats (higher amounts of residues than for wheat), the SOM budget was slightly negative in this year, that is, the soils lost their organic matter stock. Although it is difficult to generalize the C budget in different years because of the large variations in crop growth due to fluctuating water resources, the disadvantage of summer fallow (no residues) was obvious in terms of SOM budget. The net soil respiration rate in the fallow plot, 2.9 Mg C ha(-1), was approximately equivalent to 4% of the total SOM stock in the plow layer (30 cm) (70 to 80 Mg C ha(-1)).

This study analysed the effects of summer droughts and heat waves on the persistence and production of perennial forage grasses. Mediterranean and temperate populations of Dactylis glomerata L. and Festuca arundinacea (Schreb.) were compared at both Mediterranean and temperate sites in France. By manipulating canopy temperatures and water availability, grass swards in the field were subjected to cumulative summer and spring water deficits (CSSWD) ranging from 329 to 707 mm to test different projected climatic conditions and extreme summer events. Under controlled summer heat waves (621 days at a mean daily canopy temperature higher than 3035 degrees C), there was no increase in membrane damage to surviving aerial tissues. Plant stress was thus mainly generated through greater soil water deficit. Under the greatest CSSWD, annual biomass production was reduced on average by 60% and 30% with temperate and Mediterranean populations, respectively. Thresholds for a significant increase in summer tiller mortality were seen at CSSWD higher than 450 mm for temperate populations and 550 mm for Mediterranean populations. The latter displayed lower predawn leaf water potentials in summer and recovered through intense tillering in the subsequent seasons. Under the most extreme CSSWD, fewer than 20% of tillers of temperate populations survived and their nitrogen uptake ability was drastically altered. The higher potential productivity of Mediterranean populations in winter was associated with greater frost sensitivity. The identification of thresholds for vulnerability and the determination of the role of genetic diversity will improve the management of plant resilience and the design of new plant material to cope with climate change.",,,,,,"POIRIER-POCOVI, Magalie/0000-0003-3640-7964",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,,,,,DEC,2012,18,12,,,,,3632,3646,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02800.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02800.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000310564200015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The centerpiece is a highly contained, 13-m(3) chamber to host communities of aquatic and terrestrial species and control climate (temperature, humidity, rainfall, irradiance) and atmosphere conditions (O-2 and CO2 concentrations). Temperature in the atmosphere and in the water or soil column can be controlled independently of each other. All climatic and atmospheric variables can be programmed to follow dynamical trajectories and simulate gradual as well as step changes. We demonstrate the Ecolab's capacity to simulate a broad range of atmospheric and climatic conditions, their diurnal and seasonal variations, and to support the growth of a model terrestrial plant in two contrasting climate scenarios.

The experiment consisted of two hydrographic surveys and a three-dimensional instrumented array that included 51 current/temperature sensors distributed on 18 moorings. Moorings were maintained across the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca (to monitor the fluctuating buoyant source/sink) and along three cross-shelf transects roughly 40, 90, and 130 km north of the mouth of the strait. To detect possible incoming propagating coastal-trapped waves (CTWs), moorings were also located approximately 10 and approximately 30 km south of the mouth of the strait. The main thrust of the experiment was to attempt to identify signals specifically associated with buoyant outflow from the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Four such signals were identified. (1) A seasonally varying mean poleward flow over the mid and inner shelf. (2) Velocity and temperature fluctuations associated with buoyant plumes over the shelf. The plumes, which occur at roughly monthly and bimonthly intervals, are driven by anomalously strong freshwater pulses from the strait, and the associated fluctuations in the along-isobath component of velocity accounted for about 20% (10%) of the variance during summer (fall) in the region within about 50 km of the mouth of the strait. (3) Positive temperature anomalies (approximately 3-degrees-C) related to the cessation of strait outflow. These anomalies, which are strongest at and south of the mouth of the strait, occur during periods of regional southwesterly winds and have a south-to-north lag consistent with poleward advection of the pre-existing (usually cold) plume water at about 30 km d-1. (4) Phase modification of the wind-driven CTW and local wind-driven velocity signals across the mouth of the strait: a south to north phase difference of about 90-degrees is observed across the mouth of the strait at low (< 0.12 cpd) frequencies during both summer and fall. Statistical analysis as well as application of a first-mode wind-driven CTW model demonstrated that the dominant variance over the Vancouver Island shelf is related primarily to the first-mode wind-driven CTW (summer, approximately 55%) or local wind forcing (fall, approximately 80%). This being the case, and also because of the rugged shelf topography in the area, the analysis proved insufficient to identify definitively more subtle results of plume and strait processes such as the local generation of CTWs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,JUN 15,1991,96,C6,,,,,10507,10538,,10.1029/90JC02578,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/90JC02578,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991FT34300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

These are not homogeneously distributed in time: Instead, they appear within irregularly intermittent temporal intervals, whose irregular duration varies, in general, with the signal fluctuation frequency. A similar irregularly intermittent, frequency-dependent appearance of energetic fluctuations is found in long-term Earth system model integrations, consisting of a multi-millennia control experiment (i.e., an unforced simulation) and forced simulations covering the last millennium. Here, for the first time, we investigate the long-term relative importance of internal and externally-driven variability and their possible interferences on Global Surface Temperature (GST). Multidecadal GST fluctuations are mostly associated to internal variability. Externally-forced perturbations acting predominantly on centennial timescales tend to overwhelm such variability and to enhance O(similar to 200 years) GST fluctuations. Externally-forced perturbations tend also to correspond to major changes in the coherency among internal climate processes, and among them and GST. Citation: Zanchettin, D., A. Rubino, and J. H.

This provides a reference distribution, characteristic of the studied genotype, to which any distribution in stressed plants can be compared, (2) Evaporative demand and soil water deficit affected independently the distribution of relative elongation rate and had near-additive effects.

Using an ex situ population of Cryptobranchus alleganiensis, an aquatic North American salamander, we tested the hypothesis that naturally occurring periods of temperature variation negatively impact amphibian health, either through direct effects on immune function or by increasing physiological stress. We exposed captive salamanders to repeated cycles of temperature fluctuations recorded in the population's natal stream and evaluated behavioral and physiological responses, including plasma complement activity (i.e. bacteria killing) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila. The best-fit model (Delta AIC(c)=0, w(i)=0.9992) revealed 70% greater P. aeruginosa killing after exposure to variable temperatures and no evidence of thermal acclimation. The same model predicted 50% increased E. coli killing, but had weaker support (Delta AIC(c)=1.8, w(i)=0.2882). In contrast, plasma defenses were ineffective against A. hydrophila, and other health indicators (leukocyte ratios, growth rates and behavioral patterns) were maintained at baseline values. Our data suggest that amphibians can tolerate, and even benefit from, natural patterns of rapid warming/cooling. Specifically, temperature variation can elicit increased activity of the innate immune system.

The structure of the temperature-index method is simple and produces reasonable simulation results if the parameters are well within empirical ranges. Although the data requirement for the energy balance method in current observation is difficult to meet and the existence of uncertainty is associated with the experimental approaches of physical processes, the SWAT-JTH model still produced a reasonably high NSE. We conclude that using temperature-index methods to simulate the snowmelt process is sufficient, but the energy balance-based model is still a good choice to simulate extreme weather conditions especially when the required data input for the model is acquired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1672-6316,1993-0321,,,,MAR,2015,12,2,,,,,368,381,,10.1007/s11629-014-3081-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-014-3081-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000351664200009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because of their narrow thermal ranges, tropical ectotherms are predicted to be most threatened by global warming, yet tests of this prediction are often confounded by other anthropogenic disturbances. We used a tropical forest soil warming experiment to directly test the effect of temperature increase on litter-dwelling ants. Two years of continuous warming led to a change in ant community between warming and control plots. Specifically, six ant genera were recorded only on warming plots, and one genus only on control plots. Wasmannia auropuctata, a species often invasive elsewhere but native to this forest, was more abundant in warmed plots. Ant recruitment at baits was best predicted by soil surface temperature and ant heat tolerance. These results suggest that heat tolerance is useful for predicting changes in daily foraging activity, which is directly tied to colony fitness. We show that a 2-year increase in temperature (of 2-4 degrees C) can have a profound effect on the most abundant insects, potentially favouring species with invasive traits and moderate heat tolerances.",,,,,,"Kaspari, Michael/0000-0002-9717-5768; Bujan, Jelena/0000-0002-7938-0266; Meir, Patrick/0000-0002-2362-0398; Yanoviak, Stephen/0000-0001-6425-1413",,,,,,,,,,,,,1744-9561,1744-957X,,,,APR 6,2022,18,4,,,,,,,20210518,10.1098/rsbl.2021.0518,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0518,,,,,,,,35382584,,,,,WOS:000780820500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experimental results show that two formalisms of current crop simulation models are not adapted for the simulation of sunflower leaf development: - in the first formalism, it is considered that the absolute expansion rate of a leaf on one day is related to the carbon balance on the same day. Moderate water deficits cause a reduction in leaf expansion without affecting net photosynthesis per leaf They cause an increase in sugar concentration in the leaf; - in the second one, daily increase in size of an organ (absolute expansion rate) is linked to environmental conditions on the same day. Water deficits or reduction in light interception affect absolute expansion during the period of stress but also after the re-establishment of favourable conditions. We propose a model of leaf expansion in which the consideration of relative expansion rate instead of absolute expasnsion rate allow to take into account the negativ after effect of a water deficit or of a decrease in light interception. Relative expansion rate at one time depends on the environmental conditions at the same time. its expression in thermal time allow to take into account the effect of temperature. Relative expansion rate is reduced by water deficit and by a reduction in light interception. Durations of expansion and of cell division in a leaf are stable if expressed in thermal time for a given position on the stem in a large range of light and soil water status conditions.",,,,,"Christine, Granier/C-5226-2010; Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1258-8210,,,,,MAR-APR,2000,7,2,,,,,219,228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088891900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) have a broad natural distribution from Canada to Mexico, it was hypothesized that natural differences in thermal tolerance and seasonal growth may be attributed to different geographical strains. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that these differences would be observed in hybrid catfish (I. punctatus x [blue catfish] I. furcatus). Chronic thermal tolerance and growth rate were quantified in two geographically distinct strains of channel catfish and a corresponding hybrid catfish from one of these strains with a cross to an industry standard blue catfish strain. In a 6-week growth experiment, catfish were subjected to daily cycling temperatures of either 27-31 degrees C or 32-36 degrees C, mimicking pond fluctuations. Hybrid catfish had the highest survival at both temperatures, and both strains of channel catfish had greater growth in weight or length at 27-31 degrees C than at 32-36 degrees C.

No differences in susceptibility to the Cordyceps sp. isolates were observed among 1st, 2nd, and 3rd instar nymphs with respect to median lethal time (LT50) values. Confirmed mortalities ranged from 63.7 to 87.8% when the isolates were tested at 5 x 10(7) conidia mL(-1). The 4th instar was the least susceptible to the fungal isolates (<= 36.6% mortality). However, 60.0 to 99.5% of the adults that emerged from 4th instar nymphs previously treated with the fungus succumbed to the infection. Temperature was more detrimental to Cordyceps sp. virulence towards B. tabaci nymphs than relative humidity (RH). At similar RH, median LT50 for 1st instar (9.4 days) was higher than for 3rd instar (5.3 days) when the fungus was tested at 5 x 10(7) conidia mL(-1); minimal temperatures of >= 12.6 degrees C compared to >= 17.0 degrees C were registered for experiments with 1st and 3rd instars, respectively.

While an increasing number of empirical studies have shown that environmental changes can alter the strengths of species interactions, these studies are typically short (<1-2 generations) and therefore give only partial information about longer term population dynamics. To focus on longer term dynamics, we investigated population cycles of pea aphids and their most common parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, in Wisconsin, USA. Data collected over three years in alfalfa fields showed an apparent host parasitoid population cycle. Furthermore, higher pea aphid population growth rates and increased parasitism were correlated with higher naturally occurring temperatures. While these effects were observed with seasonal fluctuations in temperature, they beg the question of how long-term changes in mean annual temperature might change aphid-parasitoid population cycles, a question which we further pursued with laboratory experiments. To quantify temperature-dependent demographic parameters, we used short-term (<1 generation) experiments conducted at 20 degrees C and 27 degrees C. The higher temperature increased aphid and parasitoid development rates, adult aphid life span and fecundity, and parasitoid attack rates. We then conducted multi-generation population-level laboratory experiments to reveal the effects of temperature (20 degrees C vs. 27 degrees C) on population dynamics. We fit the resulting time series data using a nonlinear age-structured state-space model to estimate population-level processes that could not be estimated in short-term laboratory experiments. Using the model, we parsed out the demographic rates that had the largest impacts on aphid-parasitoid population cycles. This analysis showed that there were frequent contrasts in the effects of temperature operating through different demographic rates. For example, the temperature-dependent increase in aphid development rate decreased cycle amplitude, while the increase in parasitoid attack rate increased cycle amplitude: There were also striking interactions among demographic rates. For example, the temperature-dependent increase in aphid development rate could either increase or decrease the cycle period depending on the values of other demographic rates. Although these complexities make predictions difficult, overall they suggest that increasing long-term mean temperature will decrease the period, increase the amplitude, and tend to destabilize pea aphid-A. ervi dynamics.",,,,,"Harmon, Jason/AAW-3036-2021","Harmon, Jason/0000-0002-2533-5005",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,,,AUG,2014,84,3,,,,,457,476,,10.1890/13-1933.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-1933.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000340081900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, to fully understand the variation in body temperature over the course of the day, we also need to consider effects of variation in work rate. We made use of a dataset on body temperature during the resting and active periods in female marsh tits (Poecile palustris) that bred in a temperate area and were subjected to experimental changes in reproductive investment through brood size manipulations. Furthermore, the amplitude increased with daytime, but were unaffected by nighttime, ambient temperature. Amplitudes in females with manipulated broods were 44% above predictions based on inter-specific allometric relationships. In extreme cases, amplitudes were > 100% above predicted values. However, no individual female realised the maximum potential amplitude (8.5 degrees C, i.e. the difference between the highest and lowest body temperature within the population) but seemed to prioritise either a reduction in body temperature at night or an increase in body temperature in the day. This suggests that body temperature amplitude might be constrained by costs that preclude extensive use of both low nighttime and high daytime body temperatures within the same individual. Amplitudes in the range found here (0.5-6.7 degrees C) have previously mostly been reported from sub-tropical and/or arid habitats. We show that comparable values can also be found amongst birds in relatively cool, temperate regions, partly due to a pronounced increase in body temperature during periods with high work rate.",,,,,,"Nilsson, Jan-Ake/0000-0001-8982-1064",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,OCT,2021,197,2,,,,,365,371,,10.1007/s00442-021-05026-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-05026-2,,SEP 2021,,,,,,34494171,,,,,WOS:000695349300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Humidity had no effect on the softening rate of hard seed under constant temperature conditions. High humidity increased the softening rate of hard seed compared to 0% humidity under fluctuating temperatures. In another experiment, hard seeds of subterranean clover were subjected to constant or fluctuating temperature conditions and an atmosphere of butanol, ethanol, n-butylamine or a no solvent control. Butylamine increased the softening rate of hard seed at the constant temperature. Fluctuating temperatures increased the softening rate of hard seed with all solvent treatments. The order of softening rate among the solvents was butanol < ethanol < butylamine. The correlation between the relative swelling ability of the three solvents with mean percentage hard seed after exposure to fluctuating temperatures for 56 days was - 99.7 (P < 0.01). Results were interpreted to mean that fluctuating temperatures cause changes in the adsorption of water to cell wall fibres in the seed coat.

Additionally, common cocklebur achenes were collected in fall of 2003 and of 2004 to assess changes in tight and temperature requirements for germination over a 12-mo period under field conditions. Common cocklebur germination in response to the light environment and to constant and fluctuating temperatures were evaluated under controlled conditions following achene retrieval from the Field. There was a linear inverse relationship between shade intensity and soil thermal amplitude, which explained 77% of the variability in emergence in the field over 2 yr. Emergence decreased as soil thermal amplitude declined, with 95% shading resulting in a 72 to 88% reduction in emergence. Neither red nor far-red light had much effect on germination, and burial did not induce a light requirement. Germination of achenes retrieved from the soil surface or buried in soil generally was not affected by red or far-red light, and the achenes did not acquire a red-light requirement following burial. Daily exposure to natural greenhouse light at 24 to 30 C was essential for germination immediately following achene maturation, whereas no germination occurred in darkness. A thermal fluctuation of 15 C increased germination percentages over those at constant temperatures regardless of time after maturation or retrieval-depth of achenes. The mean fluctuating temperature over all sample dates that was generally optimal for germination was 25 C (17-5/32.5 C low/high temperatures; 15 C daily fluctuation) in April or May and July or August in both years. Germination was generally Optimum at constant temperatures of 35 or 40 C. The higher mean temperature requirement for germination at constant temperatures than at fluctuating temperatures likely contributes to reduced emergence in spring and summer months, when earlier emerging weed species or crops have already become established, and the thermal fluctuation requirement for germination reduces the likelihood of emergence in an environment where light availability is diminished.",,,,,"Norsworthy, Jason/GXZ-5733-2022","Norsworthy, Jason/0000-0002-7379-6201",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1745,1550-2759,,,,MAY-JUN,2007,55,3,,,,,227,234,,10.1614/WS-06-184,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WS-06-184,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000246418600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unfortunately, fluctuating ambient temperatures can cause dramatic pressure variations due to the presence of confined air inside the infiltrometer, thereby affecting the intended pressure head to be applied to the soil surface and hence also the measured infiltration rate. This is especially true for low infiltration rates and long equilibration times typical of low permeability materials, including unsaturated fractured rock. We developed a model to analyze the effects of temperature changes on the static pressure of the confined air volume within tension infiltrometers. The model was tested using several prototype infiltrometer designs in a computer-controlled variable-temperature room. Experimental results confirmed the model simulations. For example, predicted and measured changes in the pressure head in one experiment were 11.2 and 12.5 cm following a change of 18.5 degrees C in the temperature.

Less understood are the effects of increased thermal fluctuations predicted to accompany climate change. Greater fluctuations could accelerate feminization of species that produce females under warmer conditions (further endangering TSD animals), or counter it (reducing extinction risk). Here we use novel experiments exposing eggs of Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta) to replicated profiles recorded in field nests plus mathematically-modified profiles of similar shape but wider oscillations, and develop a new mathematical model for analysis. We show that broadening fluctuations around naturally male-producing (cooler) profiles feminizes developing embryos, whereas embryos from warmer profiles remain female or die. This occurs presumably because wider oscillations around cooler profiles expose embryos to very low temperatures that inhibit development, and to feminizing temperatures where most embryogenesis accrues. Likewise, embryos incubated under broader fluctuations around warmer profiles experience mostly feminizing temperatures, some dangerously high (which increase mortality), and fewer colder values that are insufficient to induce male development. Therefore, as thermal fluctuations escalate with global warming, the feminization of TSD turtle populations could accelerate, facilitating extinction by demographic collapse. Aggressive global CO2 mitigation scenarios (RCP2.6) could prevent these risks, while intermediate actions (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios) yield moderate feminization, highlighting the peril that insufficient reductions of greenhouse gas emissions pose for TSD taxa. If our findings are generalizable, TSD squamates, tuatara, and crocodilians that produce males at warmer temperatures could suffer accelerated masculinization, underscoring the broad taxonomic threats of climate change.",,,,,"Riley, Julia/H-6756-2019; Neuwald, Jennifer/AAH-3468-2021","Riley, Julia/0000-0001-7691-6910; Neuwald, Jennifer/0000-0002-8850-5534; Literman, Robert/0000-0002-1784-0407; Valenzuela, Nicole/0000-0003-1148-631X; Mizoguchi, Beatriz Akemi/0000-0003-0735-3530",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,MAR 12,2019,9,,,,,,,,4254,10.1038/s41598-019-40597-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40597-4,,,,,,,,30862793,,,,,WOS:000460922200090,View Full Record in Web of Science

Central to this debate is the fact that oxygen availability relative to demand for living organisms decreases with increasing temperature. We examined whether rotifers Lecane inermis exposed to hypoxic conditions would evolve smaller sizes than rotifers exposed to normoxic conditions, using experimental evolution with the same fluctuating temperature but differentiated by three regimes of oxygen availability: normoxia, hypoxia throughout the whole thermal range, and hypoxia only at the highest temperature. Immediately after the six-month experiment (more than 90 generations), we tested the plasticity of size responses to temperature in three post-evolution groups, and we related these responses to fitness. The results show that normoxic rotifers had evolved significantly larger sizes than two hypoxic rotifer groups, which were similar in size. All three groups displayed similar plastic body size reductions in response to warming over the range of temperatures they were exposed to during the period of experimental evolution, but they showed different and complex responses at two temperatures below this range. Any type of plastic response to different temperatures resulted in a similar fitness pattern across post-evolution groups. We conclude that (i) these rotifers showed a genetic basis for the pattern of size decrease following evolution under both temperature-dependent and temperature-independent hypoxia; and (ii) plastic body size responds consistently to temperatures that are within the thermal range that the rotifers experienced during their evolutionary history, but responses become more noisy at novel temperatures, suggesting the importance of evolutionary responses to reliable environmental cues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3185,1939-8697,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1086/722028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/722028,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000863979300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We considered that this behavior could result in daily fluctuations of the statolith strontium/calcium ratio (Sr/Ca ratio), if this ratio is thermally sensitive, as is found for coral skeletons. To investigate this hypothesis, Japanese Common Squid were reared under constant temperature (15 degreesC) for 64 days and their statolith Sr/Ca ratios, in the area that had been deposited while in captivity, measured by wavelength dispersive spectrometer. Small repetitive fluctuations were observed in the statolith Sr/Ca ratios of the captive squid (N=5, 2.7-day cycle) but similar fluctuations were also observed in the statoliths of Japanese Common Squid collected from the wild (N=5, 2.4-day cycle). These results imply that the daily vertical movements in the water column are not reflected in the statolith Sr/Ca ratios in the Japanese Common Squid.

Its population dynamics are driven by numerous environmental factors, including parasitism, particularly by trematodes. The complex life cycle of trematodes includes a free living stage (cercaria) between the first (a mollusk) and the second (an invertebrate or a vertebrate) intermediate hosts. Taking the example of Himasthla quissetensis, a dominant trematode in Arcachon Bay (France) utilizing Nassarius reticulatus as first intermediate host and the cockle as second intermediate host, we investigated the correlation between cockle infection and cercariae emergence by N. reticulatus, including the role of water temperature and light. Experimental and field data provided evidence that cercariae emergence from N. reticulatus took place during the night and for water temperature comprised between 15 degrees C and 22 degrees C (optimum at 20 degrees C). The lifespan of cercariae did not exceed 48 h and 50% of them were no more infectious after 7 h. A model was designed (emergence = f(water temperature)) in order to calculate an average monthly cercarial emergence rate according to water temperature that was daily recorded for 5 years (1998-2002). Concomitantly, non-infected cockles were transplanted each of these years in order to assess the infection rate by H. quissetensis. Infection occurred strictly for the same water temperatures (and dates) as those expected for cercariae emergence. Within each year, there was often (but not always) a good correlation between the predicted number of emerging cercariae and the observed number of cercariae transformed into metacercariae in cockles. However, the among-years variability of cockle infection (x4.4 range) was not explained by the predicted annual number of emerging cercariae. This study highlights the importance of water temperature and light in stimulating cercariae emergence which is closely related to the occurrence of cockle infection. Accordingly, climate change would be expected to alter certain parasite transmission traits. Conversely, the lack of correlation between the total number of metacercariae in cockles and the expected number of cercariae suggests that other factors contribute to infestation variability.

Past research has primarily focused on survival, making it unclear if temperature fluctuations constrain reproductive success, and if so whether populations harbour the potential to respond to climatic shifts. Here, using two decades of data from a large experimental breeding programme of the iconic ostrich (Struthio camelus) in South Africa, we show that the number of eggs females laid and the number of sperm males produced were highly sensitive to natural temperature extremes (ranging from -5 degrees C to 45 degrees C). This resulted in reductions in reproductive success of up to 44% with 5 degrees C deviations from their thermal optimum. In contrast, gamete quality was largely unaffected by temperature. Extreme temperatures also did not expose trade-offs between gametic traits. Instead, some females appeared to invest more in reproducing at high temperatures, which may facilitate responses to climate change. These results show that the robustness of fertility to temperature fluctuations, and not just temperature increases, is a critical aspect of species persistence in regions predicted to undergo the greatest change in climate volatility. Climate change may pose a challenge not only for survival of animals but also for their reproduction.

Heat stress, in particular, is known to affect plant offspring, but we do not know to what extent these effects depend on the temporal patterns of the stress, and whether transgenerational responses are adaptive and genetically variable within species. To address these questions, we carried out a two-generation experiment with nine Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes. We subjected the plants to heat stress regimes that varied in timing and frequency, but not in mean temperature, and we then grew the offspring of these plants under controlled conditions as well as under renewed heat stress. The stress treatments significantly carried over to the offspring generation, with timing having stronger effects on plant phenotypes than stress frequency. However, there was no evidence that transgenerational effects were adaptive. The magnitudes of transgenerational effects differed substantially among genotypes, and for some traits the strength of plant responses was significantly associated with the climatic variability at the sites of origin. In summary, timing of heat stress not only directly affects plants, but it can also cause transgenerational effects on offspring phenotypes.

However, the dynamics and quantitative outcome of this response in individual cells of a population, and how this influences pathogenicity are unknown. Here, we address these questions using a thermosensing virulence regulator of an intestinal pathogen (RovA of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis) as a model. We reveal that this regulator is part of a novel thermoresponsive bistable switch, which leads to high-and low-invasive subpopulations within a narrow temperature range. The temperature range in which bistability is observed is defined by the degradation and synthesis rate of the regulator, and is further adjustable via a nutrient-responsive regulator. The thermoresponsive switch is also characterized by a hysteretic behavior in which activation and deactivation occurred on vastly different time scales. Mathematical modeling accurately mirrored the experimental behavior and predicted that the thermoresponsiveness of this sophisticated bistable switch is mainly determined by the thermo-triggered increase of RovA proteolysis. We further observed RovA ON and OFF subpopulations of Y. pseudotuberculosis in the Peyer's patches and caecum of infected mice, and that changes in the RovA ON/OFF cell ratio reduce tissue colonization and overall virulence. This points to a bet-hedging strategy in which the thermoresponsive bistable switch plays a key role in adapting the bacteria to the fluctuating conditions encountered as they pass through the host's intestinal epithelium and suggests novel strategies for the development of antimicrobial therapies.",,,,,,"Wittmann, Christoph/0000-0002-7952-985X; Jahn, Dieter/0000-0002-4064-9205",,,,,,,,,,,,,1553-7366,1553-7374,,,,DEC,2016,12,12,,,,,,,e1006091,10.1371/journal.ppat.1006091,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006091,,,,,,,,28006011,,,,,WOS:000392202100058,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been argued that species living under unpredictable thermal conditions need to have more flexible physiological capabilities to meet with thermal stress than species living in thermally stable environments. Here we investigate if the ability to rapidly cold-harden in Collembola is influenced by thermal conditions of the habitat. 2. Collembola exploit diverse habitats and are therefore exposed to different thermal environments: soil dwelling (euedaphic) species occupy relatively stable environments, whereas surface dwelling (epedaphic) species can be exposed to more fluctuating thermal environments, but a single species can also be found in diverse thermal habitats within its geographic distribution. 3. We compared the inherent cold shock tolerance and ability to rapidly cold-harden in three epedaphic, two near surface dwelling (hemiedaphic) and four euedaphic species of Collembola using a similar experimental approach for all species. Additionally we compared three populations of the epedaphic species, Orchesella cincta, sampled along a climatic gradient (Norway, Denmark, Italy). 4. Inherent cold shock tolerance was estimated as LT50 by assaying cold shock survival following a 2 h exposure to a range of temperatures from 1 degrees C to -12 degrees C. Rapid cold-hardening (RCH) was induced by cooling individuals from 20 degrees C to a temperature 7 degrees C above the LT50 during 80 min, followed by 1 h at the specific cold shock temperature, which was close to the LT50 of the particular species. 5. There was large variation in cold shock survival among species. The capacity to rapidly cold-harden was found in all three ecotypes. 6. Genetic difference in the ability to rapidly cold-harden was seen in O. cincta from different climatic regions, consistent with the predictability of the thermal environment of their habitat. Population differences matched the daily fluctuations in temperature (CV) recorded at the site of collection as well as the day-to-day predictability (autocorrelation). The role of phylogenetic inertia was tested using sequence data from the cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene and no signal of phylogeny was detected that could explain these population differences. 7. Our results show that genetic differences in RCH ability exist, consistent with latitudinal gradients in thermal fluctuations and predictability; thus comparative studies can provide important insight when exploring the role of acclimation in the geographical distribution of species.",,,,,"Pertoldi, Cino/I-1746-2012; Loeschcke, Volker/J-2527-2013; Dietz, Rune/F-9154-2015; Holmstrup, Martin/I-7463-2013; Holmstrup, Martin/E-8731-2017; Beier, Claus/C-1789-2016","Pertoldi, Cino/0000-0002-4644-8981; Loeschcke, Volker/0000-0003-1450-0754; Dietz, Rune/0000-0001-9652-317X; Holmstrup, Martin/0000-0001-8395-6582; Holmstrup, Martin/0000-0001-8395-6582; Beier, Claus/0000-0003-0348-7179; Bahrndorff, Simon/0000-0002-0838-4008",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,APR,2009,23,2,,,,,340,347,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01503.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2008.01503.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000264185500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Field-collected copepods were acclimated for 24 h at 2000 cells ml-1 T. constricta, and then transferred to a range of low food concentrations (15 to 876 cells ml-1). Gut pigments were determined fluorimetrically after a 5 h period of feeding, which was calculated to be sufficient for gut contents to equilibrate to the new food concentration. Experiments were carried out during the same phase of the diel cycle (05:00 to 10:00 h) and were terminated near midday, a time when feeding rate was relatively stable, in order to standardize the effects of the diel feeding rhythm. Lower feeding thresholds of 280, 127, 282, and 214 cells ml-1 respectively at 4, 8, 12, and 16-degrees-C were indicated by segmented linear regression analysis of the relationship between gut pigments and phytoplankton concentration.

Populations of the terrestrial isopod Armadillidum vulgare (Latreille) fluctuated in density by over an order magnitude on each of three grassland sites differing markedly in habitat structure. Density and survivorship were negatively correlated with rainfall but not significantly with mean litter layer temperatures. An interaction between temperature and rainfall accentuated the negative effects on excess moisture. Tussocks in lightly grazed swards provide an important source of shelter from excessively wet conditions and from extremes of diurnal temperature fluctuation. Reduction of spatial heterogeneity in habitat structure caused by heavier grazing pressure resulted in increased mortality and decreases in population density. Shorter, more heavily grazed, swards have a higher biomass of dicotyledonous plants, the leaf litter of which forms a high quality food resource for which competition in lent: swards leads to reduced growth rates, fecundity, and natality rates in A. vulgare. When availability of this food source was experimentally increased on the site which already had the highest levels of dicotyledonous litter production, marked increases in growth and development rates and fecundity occurred, despite decreases in litter layer temperatures. We conclude that population regulation by intra-specific competition for limited food resources occurs throughout the density ranges observed but that the levels of this resource, which determine the carrying capacity of these habitats for this species, are subject to frequent changes due to variation in rabbit grazing intensity which results in dynamic equilibrium levels for the populations. Stochastic changes in the availability of shelter can reduce densities to levels at which competition for food is reduced. Under these conditions, near to the 'density floor' of the populations, extinction is avoided and recovery accelerated by the increases in growth and natality rates that result from reduced competition for food. This density dependent process therefore does act as a biotic compensating mechanism increasing the probability that the populations will persist throughout stochastic environmental perturbations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-4056,,,,,JUL,1997,41,4,,,,,342,360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XM97300011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Daily temperature fluctuations of 8 degrees C resulted in highest levels of sclerotial germination and apothecial production. The earliest appearance of apothecia occurred in the 8 degrees C fluctuation treatment, 24 days after the start of the experiment. Sclerotia in the 12 degrees C fluctuation treatment germinated last; its first sclerotium germinated 44 days after experiment initiation. For the soil water potential experiments, constant saturation (approximately -0.001 MPa) and three levels of soil water potential fluctuation from saturation - '' low '' (-0.03 to -0.04 MPa), '' medium '' (-0.06 to -0.07 MPa), and '' high '' (-0.09 to -0. 1 MPa) - were tested. Constant saturation yielded the highest number of germinated sclerotia and apothecia.

The objective for the ongoing project is, therefore, to evaluate the possibility of ensuring an indoor climate within an acceptable range making use of large exposed massive wood surfaces. An experimental study, being performed in four occupied apartments of a multi-storey residential building in Sweden, is described in this paper.

The effects of environmental conditions on various traits in laboratory populations are often extrapolated to field populations; for example, the thermal performances of laboratory populations are used to predict the phenology and abundance of wild pest populations. However, these studies generally do not consider the potential rapid evolution of the laboratory populations. Therefore, it is not certain whether laboratory populations reflect the performance of field populations in natural fluctuating and sometimes extreme conditions. Here, we used a global insect pest, the English grain aphid [Sitobion avenae (Hemiptera: Aphididae)] as the model system, to compare the demography of field and laboratory populations experimentally under constant and ecologically relevant fluctuating temperatures. Our results indicated that the field population adapted better to fluctuating temperatures and high temperatures. By contrast, the laboratory population adapted better to mild constant temperatures but reduced ability to withstand extremely high temperatures under diurnal fluctuations and chronic high temperatures. Therefore, caution is needed when extending the ecological effects of temperature from laboratory populations to wild populations, especially in environments with extreme events.

We studied the ecological conditions in these pools, the breeding behavior of females, and the larval development and behavior on the Jamaican north coast in spring and summer 1992 to 1994. Individually marked females showed a high sire fidelity, visited, molted and released their larvae repeatedly in the same pools. Larvae occurred in rockpools throughout the study periods. An abundant microfauna as well as detritus in the pools provided food resources for developing larvae. Experiments with a predatory corixid bug, which sometimes populates rockpools, indicate that larval survival in pools is significantly threatened by these bugs. Diurnal variations in pools were highest for temperature, ranging on average from 24.4 to 32.7 degrees C, and for oxygen saturation ranging from 20 to 155%. The mean pH values varied moderately between pH 8.3 to 8.9 and the salinities remained constant. Seasonal salinity variations were influenced by seawater spray, evaporation, precipitation and the distance of pools from the shore. Mean salinities and the pattern of their variation differed greatly between pools. In pools near the shore, mean salinities in 1992 ranged from 31.5 to 36.1 ppt and salinity varied between 0 to 120 ppt. In one pool distant from the shore mean salinity was 2.7 ppt and salinity varied between 0 to 8 ppt. Average salinities in the same pools were significantly higher in 1992 than in 1993, because of higher precipitation in 1993. Stratification in salinity and temperature occurred after heavy rains. Stratification in oxygen saturations occurred every night with on average 26% in the surface ;, or less below the surface. Exposed to oxygen saturations below 30% for several layer and 20% hours, larvae did not survive in laboratory experiments.

Canopy development in OTCs supplied with non-filtered air (NF) and in ambient (AA) plots was followed by measuring leaf area index (LAI). The dry matter yield was determined after three growth periods in each of two consecutive seasons. Boundary layer conductance (g(bw)) and wind speed (u) were measured along a vertical profile, and day-time flux of O-3 was estimated throughout the experiment on the basis of a mass balance. The vertical profile of u showed values in the range 1-1.2 m s(-1) at the top of the canopy, and maximum g(bw) was 20-25 mm s(-1). Average reduction in global radiation in OTCs was 25%, and volumetric soil water content was reduced by about 5%. Daily mean T-air was increased by 1.3 degrees C, mean daily maximum svpd by 0.08 kPa, and the temperature sum (degree days with base temperature of +5 degrees C) by 12%. Fluctuations in the difference in daily mean T-air and svpd during the daytime between OTCs and ambient air were related to canopy structure. Differences were largest after each cut and declined with increasing LAI. A small effect of changes in LAI on T-air and svpd occurred during periods with low soil water content. The flux of O-3 in OTCs was largest (> 100 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) before and smallest (< 20 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) after each cut. Calculated deposition velocities for O-3 (v(d)) in the range 0-3 cm s(-1) were generally higher than those measured under most field conditions. Overall, in OTCs the deficit in soil and atmospheric moisture was larger than in the open field, and the incraease in daily mean T-air was strongly influenced by the stage of canopy development. Changes in microclimate and incoming radiation affected pasture development. LAI was slightly reduced in OTCs as compared to AA plots. The total accumulated dry matter yield for all six growth periods was only about 7% lower in OTCs, but the contribution of clover to total forage mass declined during the experiment. OTCs had no significant effect on weeds. The results indicate that OTCs reduce the competitiveness of clover, and that the increase in growth of grasses compensates for the loss in clover yield.

To characterize web blight development in response to leaf wetness, plants were inoculated with two isolates of binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-U and maintained in a glasshouse in open-topped, clear plastic chambers with 0-, 4-, 8-, 12-, 16- and 20-h daily cycles of 20-30s mist at 30-min intervals under day and night temperatures of 29 and 22 degrees C, respectively.

A mixed model procedure was used to compare area under the disease progress curves (AUDPC) over 4-6weeks in experiments performed in 2008 to 2010. Isolate response to mist cycle durations was not different (P=0.4283) in 2008, but was different in 2009 (P=0.0010) and 2010 (P<0.0001) due to one isolate becoming less aggressive over time. AUDPC was consistently higher on azaleas under 16- and 20-h mist cycles, which formed a higher disease group not significantly different from each other. AUDPC under 0-, 4-, and 8-h mist cycles mostly formed a lower disease group, while ranking for a 12-h mist cycle varied across experiments from the higher, intermediate, or lower AUDPC groups.

A high-resolution mapping approach combined with mutant analysis revealed a cereal ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana LUX ARRHYTHMO/PHYTOCLOCK 1 (LUX/PCL1) as a promising candidate for the earliness per se 3 (Eps-3A(m)) locus in einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L.). Using delayed fluorescence measurements it was shown that Eps-3A(m) containing einkorn wheat accession KT3-5 had a distorted circadian clock. The hypothesis was subsequently confirmed by performing a time course study on central and output circadian clock genes, which showed arrhythmic transcript patterns in KT3-5 under constant ambient conditions, i.e., constant light and temperature. It was also demonstrated that variation in spikelet number between wild-type and mutants is sensitive to temperature, becoming negligible at 25 degrees. These observations lead us to propose that the distorted clock is causative for both early flowering and variation in spike size and spikelet number, and that having a dysfunctional LUX could have neutral, or even positive, effects in warmer climates. To test the latter hypothesis we ascertained sequence variation of LUX in a range of wheat germplasm. We observed a higher variation in the LUX sequence among accessions coming from the warmer climate and a unique in-frame mutation in early-flowering Chinese T. turgidum cultivar 'Tsing Hua no. 559.'

We conducted a nine-year survey in alpine meadow and alpine steppe to investigate the effects of inter-annual temperature and precipitation variation on plant community composition, species richness, and species diversity on the central Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. We unexpectedly found that annual variability of growing season temperature, and not precipitation, is a driver of plant composition and species diversity in both habitats. Generally, increasing temperature had a negative effect on species diversity in meadow (r(2)=0.94) and steppe (r(2)=0.95). In the meadow habitat, the proportion of grass decreased with increasing temperature and ultimately had positive impacts on the proportion of sedges. In steppe habitat, legumes increased and forbs decreased with the increase of growing season temperature; both legumes and forbs negatively affected proportion of grass and resulted in grass remaining stable under temperature change. Our results provide evidence that responses of functional group composition and species richness to temporal change of temperature are very different from those responses to mean temperature increase on the central Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

The model predicted well the bacterial growth curves, similar to the Baranyi model and better than the modified Gompertz model, especially in terms of the rate constant and the lag period of the growth curves. Using the experimental data obtained at the constant temperatures, the new logistic model was studied for growth prediction at a dynamic temperature.

We determined sex ratios in juvenile tortoises hatched from first clutches of 4 annual cohorts at the head-start facility at the US Marine Corps Base, Twentynine Palms, California, USA, using non-fatal, endoscopic inspection of gonads. Cohort sexes ranged from 97% females (female:male ratio of 6.25:1) in 2008 to 84% males (female:male ratio of 0.19:1) in 2009, apparently primarily in response to local weather conditions during the temperature-sensitive phase of incubation. Warmer weather during development of a second clutch laid in 2009 led to fewer males (55%, female:male ratio of 0.82). Efforts to cool (artificially shade) some nesting burrows were unsuccessful in increasing the proportion of male hatchlings in 2009. Cohort sex ratios were associated with average daily air temperatures during incubation, such that more females were produced during warmer periods, in good agreement with published temperature-controlled laboratory experiments. These results suggest that weather played a major role in determining sex ratios, with apparently smaller or negligible influences resulting from initial location, structure and operation of the head-start facility; experimental shading of nests; and individual mothers' variation in the timing of egg laying and placement of nests within the natal burrows.

However, we lack understanding of how single-species and multispecies associations are affected by interactions between multiple environmental stressors. We address this gap by examining how environmental degradation interacts with daily stochastic temperature variation to affect individual life history and population dynamics in a host-parasitoid trophic interaction, using the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, and its parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens. We carried out a single-generation individual life-history experiment and a multigeneration microcosm experiment during which individuals and microcosms were maintained at a mean temperature of 26 degrees C that was either kept constant or varied stochastically, at four levels of host resource degradation, in the presence or absence of parasitoids. At the individual level, resource degradation increased juvenile development time and decreased adult body size in both species. Parasitoids were more sensitive to temperature variation than their hosts, with a shorter juvenile stage duration than in constant temperatures and a longer adult life span in moderately degraded environments. Resource degradation also altered the host's response to temperature variation, leading to a longer juvenile development time at high resource degradation. At the population level, moderate resource degradation amplified the effects of temperature variation on host and parasitoid populations compared with no or high resource degradation and parasitoid overall abundance was lower in fluctuating temperatures. Top-down regulation by the parasitoid and bottom-up regulation driven by resource degradation contributed to more than 50% of host and parasitoid population responses to temperature variation. Our results demonstrate that environmental degradation can strongly affect how species in a trophic interaction respond to short-term temperature fluctuations through direct and indirect trait-mediated effects. These effects are driven by species differences in sensitivity to environmental conditions and modulate top-down (parasitism) and bottom-up (resource) regulation. This study highlights the need to account for differences in the sensitivity of species' traits to environmental stressors to understand how interacting species will respond to simultaneous anthropogenic changes.",,,,,"Fowler, Mike/H-5092-2013","Fowler, Mike/0000-0003-1544-0407; Sait, Steven/0000-0002-7208-8617",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2019,88,11,,,,,1657,1669,,10.1111/1365-2656.13069,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13069,,AUG 2019,,,,,,31330040,,,,,WOS:000480494200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature and humidity variations might effect or even damage materials sensitive to moisture. For this reason, it is important to understand the response of hygroscopic materials to variable indoor environmental conditions. Existing methods looked into the dynamic sorption capacity of materials, by analysing the impact of only humidity fluctuations, with temperature usually considered non-influential or non variable. However, temperature fluctuations may impact the moisture capacity of the materials, as materials properties might substantially vary with temperature. Moreover, in existing protocols, the humidity variations are considered to be varying under square wave fluctuations, which may not be applicable in environments, where the indoor is influenced by daily and seasonal climate variations, which presents more complex fluctuation. In this study, a simulation method that can predict the impact of environmental condition on materials under simultaneous temperature and humidity fluctuations was developed. Clay and gypsum plaster were analysed in the numerical model and results were then validated with experimental data. Materials were subjected to either sinusoidal and triangular temperature and RH variations and different cycle time intervals. The investigation of sinusoidal and triangular environmental variations pushed to a better understanding of materials response to different environments and to the improvement of the simplified model.

We tested the morphological response (shoot density and growth) of four Indo-West Pacific seagrass species (Cymodocea serrulata, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis and Zostera muelleri) to six daily light levels ranging from 0 to 23 mol m(-2) d(-1) (0-70% surface irradiance) in cool (-23 degrees C) and warm temperatures (-28 degrees C) over 14 weeks. The impact of light limitation on shoot densities and growth rates was higher at warm than at cool temperatures, and for 1 muelleri and H. ovalis than for C. serrulata and H. uninervis, in terms of both the time taken for the low light treatment to take effect and the predicted time to shoot loss (e.g. 17-143 days at 0 mol m(-2) d(-1)). Using fitted curves we estimated temperature-dependent thresholds (with estimates of uncertainty) for 50% and 80% protection of growth and shoot density, defined here as potential light thresholds in recognition that they were derived under experimental conditions. Potential light thresholds that maintained 50% and 80% of seagrass shoot density fell within the ranges 1.1-5.7 mol m(-2) d(-1) and 3.8-10.4 mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively, depending on temperature and species. Light thresholds calculated in separate in situ studies for two of the same species produced comparable results. We propose that the upper (rounded) values of 6 mol m(-2) d(-1) and 10 mol m(-2) d(-1) can be used as potential light thresholds for protecting 50% and 80% of shoot density for these four species over 14 weeks. As management guidelines should always be more conservative than thresholds for biological declines, we used error estimates to provide a quantitative method for converting potential light thresholds into guidelines that satisfy this criterion. The present study demonstrates a new approach to deriving potential light thresholds for acute impacts, describes how they can be applied in management guidelines and quantifies the timescales of seagrass decline in response to light limitation. This method can be used to further quantify cumulative impacts on potential light thresholds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies of these lines have shown clear acclimation benefits to heat tolerance induced by the fluctuating regime. First, we tested the existence of an evolved circadian controlled adjustment of heat resistance in selected flies. This was done by investigating the daily variation in time to heat knockdown in flies from both selection regimes when exposed to either a constant or a daily fluctuating thermal regime for a single generation. While daily variation in heat resistance was found, the results suggest that there was neither an evolved adaptive circadian controlled adjustment of heat resistance nor a continuous acclimation response induced by fluctuating temperatures in these lines. Second, in order to reveal functional candidates for adaptation to the fluctuating thermal regime, we investigated the global transcriptomic response to a high temperature exposure in flies from both regimes. We found that flies selected both in constant and fluctuating thermal regimes responded similarly to increasing temperature.

Developing models of seedling establishment for invasive and native species will help in the selection of species for restoration projects that are able to establish and compete with invasive species given the abiotic conditions of specific sites. Modeling germination is the first step in modeling seedling establishment. We developed thermal germination models and compared predicted and measured germination timing in incubators as a precursor to testing germination model prediction in field seedbeds. We incubated 11 revegetation species and three weed (Bromus tectorum L) seedlots at constant temperatures to develop linear and curvilinear regression equations to estimate days to 10, 25, and 50% germination for each seedlot. We compared actual time to germination with predicted time for three field-simulated diurnal temperature regimes representing March, mid-March to mid-April, and May temperatures in a big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) plant community. Bromus tectorum seedlots germinated faster than perennial grasses and forbs, especially at cooler temperatures. However, most of the revegetation species had high and fast germination for a wide range of temperatures. Germination time generally fit constant temperatures well with R(2) values >= 0.85 for 33 of 40 linear equations and >= 0.80 for 40 of 48 curvilinear equations.

Throughout the observation period, the soil at both sites functioned exclusively as a sink for atmospheric CH4. Mean CH4 oxidation rates at both sites were almost identical in magnitude (82.2 +/- 34.6 mug CH4 m(-2) h(-1) for the unfertilized site, and 84.2 +/- 31.8 mug CH4 m(-2) h(-1) for the N fertilized site) during the observation period. Results from an additional small-scale N fertilization experiment indicate that high N applications to the soil of this N-limited forest resulted only in a small reduction of CH4 oxidation: less than 30% for less than 72 d. The results indicate that the atmospheric CH4 uptake activity of the soils of forest ecosystems characterized by N limitation has the capacity to recover rapidly from the inhibitor): effects of high inorganic N inputs. CH4 oxidation rates at both sites showed no significant diurnal variation. However, there were significant seasonal differences in the magnitude of CH4 oxidation rates at both experimental sites with high rates during summer, relative low rates during winter and intermediate rates during spring and autumn. Correlation analysis revealed that CH4 oxidation rates were positively correlated with soil temperature and negatively with soil moisture. However, at low soil temperatures (<10<degrees>C), temperature was a stronger modulator of CH4 oxidation than soil moisture. Process studies on soil samples in the laboratory confirmed a pronounced positive response of CH, oxidation to changes in temperature, only within a range of 0-10 degreesC. At both experimental sites, the highest CH4 oxidation activity was observed in the A(h) layer (0-120 mm soil depth). Exposure of this layer to the atmosphere, as a result of the removal of the organic layer, resulted in a significant increase of CH4 oxidation rates. Apparently the organic layer functions as a diffusive barrier for atmospheric CH4 or O-2 to CH4 oxidizing sites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There is a need to assess yield variation with a view to facilitate crop management as well as investment decision-making, such as irrigation schemes. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of using crop simulation modelling to quantify potential and attainable yield at contrasting sites. Potential yield is that limited by temperature, radiation, for a given cultivar and season length, while attainable yield has the additional constraint of water supply (rainfall and irrigation where it is applied). The sugar cane module of the Agricultural Productions Systems Simulator (APSIM-Sugar cane) had not been previously used under Mauritian conditions. Hence, the first step is to validate the model using data from growth analysis experiments with plant and ratoon crops of three contrasting commercial cultivar (R 570, M 13/56 and M 555/60), harvested at two dates (July and October) at two sites. The validation step showed that only a limited number of crop coefficients needed adjustment: those concerning canopy expansion, biomass partitioning and crop development. Linear fit of simulated and observed data were close to the 1:1 line and coefficients of determination were highly significant for LAI (r(2)=0.66), above-ground biomass (r(2)=0.84), dry weight of cane (r(2)=0.73) and sucrose yield (r(2)=0.78). There was some indication that model modification for the effects of water stress and flowering on canopy development and biomass accumulation would improve the simulations. The model was used to assess the variability in potential and attainable yield at three sites (Pamplemousses, Medine and Reduit) using long-term climate data for the period 1961-1995, Simulations were conducted for rainfed and fully irrigated scenarios. The three sites contrasted in annual rainfall, solar radiation and mean temperature and hence in expected potential and attainable yield. The range in model-simulated yields of cultivar R 570 were close to the range of experimentally observed yields at the selected sites under rainfed and fully irrigated conditions. Simulated yields were more variable under rainfed than irrigated production, with variability increasing across sites as mean annual rainfall decreased. Under rainfed production, yield was poorly correlated with annual rainfall at all sites. At all sites, irrigated yields across the climatic record were highly positively correlated with mean daily solar radiation. The study showed that it is feasible to import a pre-existing model, parameterise it for local cultivars and conduct scenario analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Growing wild-type or non-expressing segregate plants (controls) and transformants at two PFDs (600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and full sun) resulted in a range of total antioxidant enzyme activities. Total SOD activities above that for control leaves grown in full sun did not substantially improve the recoveries of CO2-saturated photosynthesis, especially for stress treatments lasting more than 1 h, while elevated APX or GR activity did improve recoveries after 1-3 h of the chilling treatment. No synergistic effects were noted when the activities of more than one antioxidant enzyme were elevated in transgenic hybrids. Although these results suggest that the protection of photosynthesis can be realized by reducing either superoxide or H2O2 levels, thereby reducing the possibility of hydroxyl radical formation, the situation is complicated, since elevated APX or GR activity can improve recoveries even when additional SOD activity has no effect. In conclusion, to enhance the protection of photosynthesis using stroma-targeted antioxidant enzymes, enhancing metabolism associated with H2O2 is more effective than enhancing the capacity for superoxide scavenging. Although small, the improvement in the protection of photosynthetic capacity may be sufficient to improve cotton yield in temperate regions with large diurnal temperature fluctuations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,DEC,2001,52,365,,,,,2345,2354,,10.1093/jexbot/52.365.2345,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jexbot/52.365.2345,,,,,,,,11709584,,,,,WOS:000172422800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Heterotherms can use daily torpor to overcome resource shortages and adverse environmental conditions. The expression of this adaptive energy-saving strategy varies among individuals, but the factors constraining individual flexibility remain largely unknown. As energy availability depends on individual stores and/or on the ability to acquire food, the propensity and flexibility in torpor use are expected to be constrained by body condition and/or size, respectively. The aim of this study was to test whether the dependency of torpor depth on air temperature was constrained by body condition and/or body size in a small heterothermic primate, the grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). During the onset of the dry season, we monitored air temperature as well as skin temperatures of 14 free-ranging individuals (12 females, two males) of known body mass and size. Unexpectedly, torpor depth depended as much on air temperature as on body condition and size. Fatter, or larger, mouse lemurs underwent deeper torpor than smaller, or leaner, ones. Individual reaction norms of torpor depth to air temperature also revealed that the propensity to undergo deep torpor and the flexibility in torpor depth were enhanced by large body size and high body condition, whereas small, lean individuals remained normothermic. Our study illustrates that alternative physiological strategies to overcome temperature constraints co-occur in a population, with body size and condition being key determinants of the energy conservation strategy that an individual can launch.",,,,,"VUARIN, Pauline/ABA-8657-2021; Dammhahn, Melanie/AAD-5479-2019; VUARIN, Pauline/AES-9500-2022; VUARIN, Pauline/AAG-7290-2022; Henry, Pierre-Yves/G-3139-2013","VUARIN, Pauline/0000-0002-0997-0228; VUARIN, Pauline/0000-0002-0997-0228; Henry, Pierre-Yves/0000-0003-2255-7347",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,JUN,2013,27,3,,,SI,,793,799,,10.1111/1365-2435.12069,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12069,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000319420500023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results showed that the predator was able to successfully develop and reach the adult stage, on average, after 20.1 (females) and 20.6 (males) days at a temperature of 30+/-1degreesC with A gossypii as prey. On the other hand, it was not able to develop at 35+/-1degreesC, here all N-1 instars used at the beginning of the experiments had died even before moulting to N-2 instar. At alternating temperatures of 25/15+/-1degreesC, the predator reached the adult stage 23.7 (females) and 23.5 (males) days after egg hatching, whereas when the temperatures were increased to 35/22+/-1degreesC, it took a significantly shorter period: 20.6 (females) and 20.9 (males) days. In general, the highest mortality occurred during the first two nymphal instars. The total percentage mortality during development from N-1 to adult stage was 30% and 100% at the constant temperatures 30+/-1degreesC and 35+/-1degreesC, respectively. At the alternating temperatures of 25/15+/-1degreesC, it was lowest with 16.5%, while at 35/22+/-1degreesC, it was 20%. The results of the experiments on prey consumption showed that an individual D. tamaninii consumed during its development to adult stage at 30+/-1degreesC an average of 442.2 (females), 433.6 (males) aphids. At the constant temperature of 35+/-1degreesC, the average daily prey consumption started with 4 aphids and decreased continuously till it approached nil on the 9th day, where all predatory nymphs died. At the alternating temperatures of 25/15+/-1degreesC, the total prey consumption during development was, on average, 359.3 (females) and 297.0 (males) aphids, while at 35/22+/-1degreesC it was 348.5 (females) and 334.0 (males) aphids. The effect of the four temperatures on the prey consumption by D. tamaninii during the first 10 days after emergence was also studied. At a constant temperature of 30+/-1degreesC, a total of 446.4 (females) and 372.0 (males) aphids were consumed, compared to 40.6 (females) and 39.0 (males) at 35+/-1degreesC. At alternating temperatures of 25/15+/-1degreesC, the predatory adult consumed, on average, a total of 267.0 (females) and 207.0 (males) aphids. Increasing the temperature to 35/22+/-1degreesC resulted in a higher prey consumption by the adult predator, reaching 351.5 (females) and 267.7 (males) aphids over the same period.

Nine different temperatures were used for the eggs and seven for the larvae, in both cases ranging from 2 to 35-degrees-C. The temperature range where visible development was obtained was between 4 and 31-degrees-C, with the lowest lethal temperature (temperature at which the eggs did not show any sign of development and development did not resume when the eggs were placed at 15-degrees-C) being between 2 and 4-degrees-C and the highest lethal temperature between 31 and 35-degrees-C for both eggs and larvae. Temperature was found to be inversely related to developmental time. The incubation period (D) fluctuated between 76 days at 10-degrees-C and 17.6 days at 25-degrees-C, with an increase in the rate of development (100/D) from 1.13 to 5.55 between these two temperatures. The larval period varied between 48.5 days at 15-degrees-C and 28 days at 25-degrees-C with rates of development of 2.08 and 3.57 respectively. The adjustment equations used show that temperature has a greater accelerating effect on eggs than on larvae. A simple potential equation, D = aT(b), describes the relationship between temperature and developmental time better than the Belehradek equation, D = a(T-t0)-b. According to the fitted equations developmental time from spawning to the first post-larval stage is completed in 91-105 days at temperatures of 13-15-degrees-C which is very close to our experimental data. The model proposed also fits most of the data from the available literature even those for other species such as Liocarcinus holsatus (Fabricius, 1798) and Carcinus maenas (L., 1758), which suggests that a similar response of developmental time vs temperature could be expected from other related Portunidae.",,,,,"González-Gurriarán, Eduardo/A-5907-2011","González-Gurriarán, Eduardo/0000-0002-3360-7306",,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3154,,,,,NOV,1991,71,4,,,,,787,798,,10.1017/S0025315400053455,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315400053455,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GQ86900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we quantify changes in fitness and known thermal tolerance traits in replicated experimental D. melanogaster populations following more than 40 generations of evolution to either cyclic cold or hot temperatures. By evaluating fitness for both evolved populations alongside a reconstituted starting population, we show that the evolved populations were the best adapted within their respective thermal environments. More strikingly, the evolved populations exhibited increased fitness in both environments and improved resistance to both acute heat and cold stress. This unexpected parallel response appeared to be an adaptation to the rapid temperature changes that drove the cycling thermal regimes, as parallel fitness changes were not observed when tested in a constant thermal environment.

Land data assimilation can play a key role in improving heat flux prediction by merging information from a range of remotely sensed products with LSMs. This paper demonstrates this potential for an open grassland site in Australia via one-dimensional experiments spanning a year-long period. With a focus on how a LSM is impacted, in-situ field observations were assimilated. Data types as available from passive microwave and thermal infra-red remote sensors were tested for their impact, with individual and joint assimilation of LE and H, near-surface soil moisture, and skin temperature observations-all on time scales approximating satellite overpass intervals. Assessed against independent data from field observations, the multi-observation approach of joint near-surface soil moisture and skin temperature assimilation made the greatest improvements to LE (expressed as daily evapotranspiration; ET), being slightly better than for joint LE and H assimilation. This result questions the value of using LE and H retrievals from thermal imagery within an assimilation context. Individually, skin temperature assimilation was one of the best performers for soil temperature estimates but with degraded root-zone soil moisture estimates and minimal ET improvements. Likewise, near-surface soil moisture assimilation produced the greatest root-zone soil moisture improvement but with relatively modest ET improvement. Combined near-surface soil moisture and skin temperature assimilation balanced the improvements to both soil moisture and temperature states along with strong improvements to ET estimates, highlighting the benefits of multi-observation assimilation.

In addition, the combined activity and rumination data captured by accelerometers were evaluated to provide a more accurate indication of ovulation than the activity and rumination data alone. Thermal images of 30 cows were captured for different body areas (eye, ear, muzzle, and vulva) twice daily after AM and PM milking sessions during the entire experimental period. Milk progesterone data and insemination records were used to determine the date of ovulation. Cows were fitted with SCR heat and rumination long-distance tags (SCR HR LD) for 1 month. Activity- and rumination-based estrus alerts were initially identified using default threshold values set by the manufacturer; however, a range of thresholds was also created and tested for both activity and rumination to determine the potential for higher levels of accuracy of ovulation detection. Visual assessment of mounting indicators resulted in 75% sensitivity (Se), 100% specificity (Sp), and 100% positive predictive value (PPV). Overall, IRT showed poor performance for detecting cows about to ovulate. Vulval temperature resulted in the greatest (80%) Sp but the poorest (21%) Se compared with the IRT temperatures of other body areas. The SCR HR LD tags default threshold value resulted in 78% Se, 57% Sp, and 70% PPV. Lowering the activity threshold from the default value improved the sensitivity but created a large number of false positives, which resulted in a decrease in specificity. Lowering the activity threshold to 20 resulted in a detection performance of 80% Se, 94% Sp, and 67% PPV, whereas the rumination levels achieved 35% Se, 69% Sp, and 14% PPV. The area under the curve for the activity level, rumination level, and the combined measures of activity and rumination levels were 0.82, 0.54, and 0.75, respectively. Alerts generated by SCR HR LD tags based on a lower activity threshold level had high sensitivity and may be able to detect a high proportion of cows in ovulatory periods in pasture-based system; however, the specificities and positive predictive value were lower than the visual assessment of mounting indicators.

Some ectotherms possess the acclimatory capacity to shift seasonally their thermoregulatory behavior, but the frequent use of constant acclimation temperatures during experiments and the lack of information about thermal heterogeneity in the field obscures the ecological relevance of this plastic response. We examined the experimentally induced seasonal acclimation of preferred body temperatures (T-p) in alpine newts Ichthyosaura (formerly Triturus) alpestris subjected to a gradual increase in acclimation temperature from 5 degrees C during the winter to a constant 15 degrees C or diel fluctuations between 10 degrees and 20 degrees C during the spring/summer. Both the mean and range of T-p followed the increase in mean acclimation temperature without the influence of diel temperature fluctuations. The direction and magnitude of this acclimatory capacity has the potential to increase the time window available for thermoregulation.

Consequently, we expect the modification of daily temperature cycles to alter microbial biological reactions in stream sediments. Here, we aimed to study the effect of warming and changes of the diel temperature patterns on stream sediment biofilm functions tied to organic carbon decomposition, as well as on biofilm meiofaunal community structure. We performed an eight-week experiment with 12 artificial streams subjected to three different diel temperature patterns: warming, warmer nights and control. Significant effects of warming on biofilm function and structure were mainly detected in the long term. Our results showed that warming altered biofilm function, especially in the warmer nights' treatment, which enhanced beta-glucosidase enzyme activity. Interestingly, clear opposite diel patterns were observed for dissolved organic carbon and b-glucosidase activity, suggesting that, at night, sediment bacteria quickly consume the input of photosynthetic dissolved organic carbon labile compounds created during light-time. The biofilm structure was also altered by warming, as both warming and warmer night treatments enhanced copepod abundance and diminished abundances of turbellaria and nematodes, which, in turn, controlled bacterial, algal and ciliate communities. Overall, we conclude that warming has strong effect on sediment biofilm structure and enhanced microbial organic matter degradation which might, consequently, affect higher trophic levels and river carbon cycling.",,,,,"FREIXA, ANNA/L-2785-2014; Freixa, Anna/T-3330-2019; Acuña, Vicenç/L-6608-2014; Romaní, Anna M/L-7572-2014","FREIXA, ANNA/0000-0003-1149-6526; Acuña, Vicenç/0000-0002-4485-6703; Romaní, Anna M/0000-0001-5183-8231",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,SEP,2017,23,9,,,,,3825,3837,,10.1111/gcb.13664,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13664,,,,,,,,28208235,,,,,WOS:000406812100032,View Full Record in Web of Science

The amplitudes of temperature variation and the ability of species to tolerate thermal stress are crucial for species fitness and survival in rapidly changing environments. Small differences in the life histories of species or in their responses to environmental variation can differentiate their niche and support coexistence; hence, even small changes in environmental conditions may not only affect the fitness of individual species, but also the outcome of species interactions. In the present experiments, the free-living nematode species Halomonhystera disjuncta is used as a model organism to investigate physiological and behavioural responses to environmental change in an ecological context of species interactions. We examine population fitness and food-taxis behaviour of H. disjuncta under different temperature regimes in the presence and absence of a competing species. Both stressors - temperature and competition - affected life-history traits and population development of the model species in different ways; the nematode populations exhibited higher fitness under a daily fluctuating temperature regime, but a lower fitness under an increased constant temperature. The presence of a competing species had a negative effect on its population fitness and food-finding behaviour at all temperature regimes, yet the most pronounced effects of competition were observed at the highest temperatures, suggesting that interspecific interactions such as competition may weaken a species' intrinsic tolerance to environmental change. Thermal stress thus not only affects species fitness but also species interactions, which in turn will likely have repercussions for species coexistence.",,,,,"Vafeiadou, Anna-Maria/F-4216-2017","Vafeiadou, Anna-Maria/0000-0003-1858-027X; Moens, Tom/0000-0001-6544-9210",,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,JAN,2021,120,,,,,,,,106958,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106958,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106958,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000591903100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Population recovery rates and phenology depend on reproductive and development rates, which in turn are driven largely by temperature. We aimed to quantify the relationships between eggsac development rates and temperature in order to understand the relative value of different linyphiid species for the biological control of agricultural pests. Female adults of nine linyphiid species were collected from winter wheat in the UK over 3 years; Bathyphantes gracilis (Blackwall), Erigone atra ( Blackwall), Erigone dentipalpis ( Wider), Erigone promiscua O. P.- Cambridge), Tenuiphantes tenuis ( Blackwall) [ formerly Lepthyphantes tenuis ( Blackwall)], Meioneta rurestris ( C. L. Koch), Oedothorax apicatus ( Blackwall), Oedothorax fuscus ( Blackwall), and Oedothorax retusus (Westring). These are agrobiont species that are dominant in agroecosystems. We tested how well development in the field can be predicted on the basis of laboratory experiments. We also built a simple phenology simulation model to test whether spider phenology in the field can be predicted by a general knowledge of the relationship between temperature and development rate. The relationships between temperature and development rates of eggsacs were not linear as described by a day-degree model, but exponential as described by a biophysical model. Duration of the eggsac development period in the field was predicted accurately from laboratory experiments. We only found minor differences between development thresholds of eggsacs at constant temperatures compared with fluctuating temperatures. The phenology model predicted the phenology of L. tenuis and E. atra well, but the number of generations predicted for O. fuscus was not realised in the field. This suggests that development of this species may be affected by factors other than temperature.

Muscari spp.,SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ecophysiological aspects of seed germination were investigated in four Mediterranean geophytes of the genus Muscari (Liliaceae): M. comosum (tassel hyacinth), M. neglectum (common grape hyacinth), M. commutatum and M. weissii. Experiments were performed at constant temperatures in the dark and under temperature and light conditions simulating those prevailing in nature during November-January, i.e. well into the rainy season of the Mediterranean climate. In all species, no primary dormancy was revealed, and germination occurred in a rather narrow range of cool temperatures (optimum at 10 or 15degreesC) and at a remarkably slow rate; both germination characteristics seem to be associated with autumn/winter seed germination and seedling establishment. Such a postulated strategy is ecologically advantageous within an unpredictable rainfall regime, known to prevail during the start of the rainy period of the Mediterranean climate. This strategy may also explain the spread of germination of M. comosum seeds over two consecutive years, observed by Theophrastus. Far-red light, simulating light conditions under a dense canopy, resulted in only a slight delay of germination compared to dark controls. Diurnal white light, qualitatively simulating natural daylight, caused a significant decrease of the germination rate in all four species studied. Moreover, white light was found to suppress considerably final seed germination (photoinhibition) in M. weissii and M. neglectum; in the latter species, prolonged imbibition under white light also led to the induction of secondary dormancy.",,,,,"Thanos, Costas/A-3877-2008; Doussi, Maria A./AAA-4319-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-2585,1475-2735,,,,SEP,2002,12,3,,,,,193,201,,10.1079/SSR2002111,http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/SSR2002111,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000177534100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results of these models can be very different when parameterised to different species of host snail, which have varying temperature preferences. Currently, the experimental data needed by these models are available for only a few species of snail. The choice of density-dependent functions can also affect model results, but the effects of increasing densities on Biomphalaria populations have only previously been investigated in artificial aquariums. Methods: Laboratory experiments were conducted to estimate Biomphalaria sudanica mortality, fecundity and growth rates at ten different constant water temperatures, ranging from 13-32 degrees C. Snail cages were used to determine the effects of snail densities on B. sudanica and B. stanleyi mortality and fecundity rates in semi-natural conditions in Lake Albert. Results: B. sudanica survival and fecundity were highest at 20 degrees C and 22 degrees C respectively. Growth in shell diameter was estimated to be highest at 23 degrees C in small and medium sized snails, but the relationship between temperature and growth was not clear. The fecundity of both B. sudanica and B. stanleyi decreased by 72-75% with a four-fold increase in population density. Increasing densities four-fold also doubled B. stanleyi mortality rates, but had no effect on the survival of B. sudanica. Conclusions: The optimum temperature for fecundity was lower for B. sudanica than for previously studied species of Biomphalaria. In contrast to other Biomphalaria species, B. sudanica have a distinct peak temperature for survival, as opposed to a plateau of highly suitable temperatures. For both B. stanleyi and B. sudanica, fecundity decreased with increasing population densities. This means that snail populations may experience large fluctuations in numbers, even in the absence of any external factors such as seasonal temperature changes. Survival also decreased with increasing density for B. stanleyi, in contrast to B. sudanica and other studied Biomphalaria species where only fecundity has been shown to decrease.",,,,,"Booth, Mark/D-2266-2011","Booth, Mark/0000-0002-5507-888X; McCreesh, Nicky/0000-0003-1409-8531; Moses, Arinaitwe/0000-0001-6340-465X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1756-3305,,,,,NOV 12,2014,7,,,,,,,,503,10.1186/s13071-014-0503-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-014-0503-9,,,,,,,,25388819,,,,,WOS:000348550000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the generalists tolerate wide variations in body temperature (T-b), the specialists maintain T-b at a more constant level. The model has gained support from inter-specific comparisons relating to species and population levels. However, little is known about consistent among-individual variation within populations that could be shaped by natural selection. We studied the consistency of individual heterothermic responses to environmental challenges in a single population of yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), by verifying the hypothesis that T-b variation is a repeatable trait. To induce the heterothermic response, the same individuals were repeatedly food deprived for 24 h. We measured T-b with implanted miniaturised data loggers. Before each fasting experiment, we measured basal metabolic rate (BMR). Thus, we also tested whether individual variation of heterothermy correlates with individual self-maintenance costs, and the potential benefits arising from heterothermic responses that should correlate with body size/mass. We found that some individuals clearly entered torpor while others kept T-b stable, and that there were also individuals that showed intermediate thermoregulatory patterns. Heterothermy was found to correlate negatively with body mass and slightly positively with the BMR achieved 1-2 days before fasting. Nonetheless, heterothermy was shown to be highly repeatable, irrespective of whether we controlled for self-maintenance costs and body size.

Roots of young tomato seedlings were bathed in containers of nutrient solution kept at temperatures ranging from 10-degrees to 35-degrees-C at 5-degrees-C intervals. The experiments ran from 14 to 21 days beginning at cotyledon expansion. Shoot and root growths of seedlings kept at root temperatures 25-degrees and 30-degrees-C were greater than those of seedlings grown at other root temperatures. The number of flowers on the first truss of plants whose roots were exposed to 25-degrees-C was greater than those on trusses of seedlings grown at other root temperatures, whether the air temperature remained constant at 20-degrees or fluctuated between 20-degrees and 30-degrees-C. No difference in the number of nodes on the primary axes among plants was found in this experiment. 2. In experiments conducted during three different times of the year; spring, late spring to early summer, and late fall to early winter, roots of plants were exposed to various temperatures from anthesis of flowers on the first truss to fruit harvest on the third truss. Shoot growth of plants grown at root temperatures between 20-degrees and 30-degrees-C was better than that of plants grown at other root temperatures. Root temperatures favorable for root growth have a range lower than that for optimum shoot growth. Fruit production from plants grown at root temperatures of 10-degrees and 35-degrees-C was very low because of poor fruit set and growth, especially on those of second and third trusses. 3. Fruit ripening was accelerated on plants grown at root temperature of 10-degrees and 15-degrees-C, especially in the 15-degrees-C treatment if the nutrient solution was low in nitrogen. 4.

The benefit of fluctuating temperature has generally been attributed to the non-linear properties of the relationship of many life history traits with temperature. Daily temperature rise, however, usually coincide with the light phase of the photoperiodic cycle and there could be a benefit in linking daily temperature fluctuations with light and dark phases e.g. to anticipate the change in temperature. Such synergistic effects have primarily been studied in the light of activity patterns and gene expression, but have not yet been shown to extend to population dynamics and aspects of individual fitness like oviposition behavior. We therefore explored possible synergistic effects on life history traits of the springtail Orchesella cincta. We first test the primary effect of ecologically relevant temperature fluctuations of different amplitudes on population growth and total population mass. The slowest population growth was observed in the constant temperature regime treatment and the highest population growth in the regime with high amplitude fluctuations. In a second experiment, population growth and oviposition rhythm were measured under four different regimes; a constant light and temperature regime, thermoperiod only, photoperiod only and thermoperiod and photoperiod aligned as under natural conditions. The regime in which thermoperiod was aligned with photoperiod resulted in a higher population growth than could be realized by either factor alone. Also, significantly fewer eggs were laid in the constant temperature/light regime than in the other three regimes, strongly suggesting that this regime is stressful to O. cincta. Additionally, the fraction of eggs laid at night was highest in the regime with the combined temperature and light cycle. In conclusion, our results show that under these experimental conditions there is a synergistic effect of daily temperature fluctuations in combination with light/dark phases that can considerably influence important life history traits and affect behavior. Such effects are likely to be relevant under natural conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It is known that starch degradation is regulated by the clock in source-limited plants, which degrade their starch in a linear manner such that it is almost but not completely exhausted at dawn. We asked whether this response is maintained under an extreme carbon deficit. Arabidopsis was subjected to a sudden combination of a day of low irradiance, to decrease starch at dusk, and a warm night. Starch was degraded in a linear manner through the night, even though the plants became acutely carbon starved. We conclude that starch degradation is not increased to meet demand in carbon-limited plants. This network property will allow stringent control of starch turnover in a fluctuating environment. In contrast, in sink-limited plants, which do not completely mobilize their starch during the night, starch degradation was accelerated in warm nights to meet the increased demand for maintenance and growth. Across all conditions, the rate of growth at night depends on the rate of starch degradation, whereas the rate of maintenance respiration decreases only when starch degradation is very slow. The impact of demand on the rate of starch breakdown was compared in source- and sink-limited Arabidopsis plants. In source-limited plants the rate of starch breakdown is paced by the clock such that starch is almost but not completely exhausted at dawn, and is not increased above this rate to meet demand, even when starch reserves are so low that they do not cover the requirements for maintenance and catabolism is induced early in the night. In sink-limited plants, which do not completely mobilise their starch during the night, starch degradation is accelerated to meet the increased demand for maintenance and growth. The rate of growth at night is closely linked to the rate of starch breakdown, while maintenance respiration is largely independent of starch breakdown except in conditions when carbon reserves are very low.",,,,,"Stitt, Mark/GVT-1242-2022; Pilkington, Sarah/R-9898-2017","Pilkington, Sarah/0000-0002-0948-5716; Stitt, Mark/0000-0002-4900-1763; Pyl, Eva-Theresa/0000-0002-1495-4660",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-7791,1365-3040,,,,JAN,2015,38,1,,,,,157,171,,10.1111/pce.12381,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.12381,,,,,,,,24905937,,,,,WOS:000346429800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our model predicts that traits that are subject to temperature effects during development will evolve a flat or U-shaped reaction norm (average scale count as a function of developmental temperature). We tested this prediction by maintaining 67 female garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) at eight different constant temperatures (21degrees-33degreesC) during pregnancy and making a series of scale counts on their newborn offspring (n=491). To insure that the experimental temperatures were ecologically 491 relevant, we used automated radiotelemetry to record the body temperature of pregnant, free-ranging females. The resulting temperature data allowed us to test the prediction that the inflection points of reaction norms would correspond to the average temperature experienced by embryos in the field. In line with predictions of the Osgood model, reaction norms were flat or U-shaped. In the case of U-shaped reaction norms, the inflection point of the curves corresponded to the average temperature imposed on embryos by free-ranging females. In contrast to some past studies, none of the standard scale scores (ones commonly used in systematics) showed significant temperature effects in either sex. Reaction norms were flat. In contrast, incidences of various abnormalities showed U-shaped reaction norms. Temperature effects were more pronounced in males than in females.

Thus, the direction and intensity of sexual selection should be affected by thermal conditions. However, the effects of temperature variation during mating events have sometimes been overlooked. We assessed traits associated with pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection in the cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne, using three thermal mating conditions: 19 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 31 degrees C. Thermal conditions did not affect precopulatory traits (mating rate, mating latency and courtship intensity). Mating duration increased with decreasing temperature, whereas the number of sperm transferred and female fecundity were greatest at 25 degrees C. To investigate whether these thermal differences affected the risk of sperm competition (remating rate) and fitness consequences for both sexes, we conducted double-mating experiments using a black colour mutant. Females that had first mated at low or high temperatures were more likely to accept remating and exhibited higher fecundity compared to females that rejected remating; when females remated, the paternity of the first male was highest at 25 degrees C. Thermal conditions at the first mating event affected the fitness consequences for both sexes, irrespective of the females' remating acceptance. Changes to the thermal conditions for the female remating event caused no difference in the female remating rate or fecundity; however, the paternity of the second mate was highest at the intermediate temperature, and this could be attributed to the decreased sperm transfer at low and high temperatures. Our results suggest that temperature conditions during mating affect postcopulatory processes in L. serricorne. In particular, when females first mated at extreme temperatures, polyandry was promoted, potentially favouring males with higher sperm competitive ability through increased likelihood and intensity of sperm competition.

The comparison between the sasa and no-sasa forests suggested that removal of S. borealis by sika deer had an indirect positive effect on seedling emergence and survival.

It was therefore suggested that cormorants might employ a behavioural strategy to reduce daily energy expenditure by minimizing the amount of time spent in water. However, European shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) have been observed to spend up to 7 h day(-1) diving in water of around 5-6 degrees C. To gain a better understanding of the energetic requirements in European shags, we measured their metabolic rates when resting in air/water and during shallow diving using respirometry. To investigate the effects of water temperature and feeding status on metabolic rate, birds dived at water temperatures ranging from 5 to 13 degrees C in both post-absorptive and absorptive states. In parallel with respirometry, stomach temperature loggers were deployed to monitor body temperature. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) was almost identical to allometric predictions at 4.73 W kg(-1). Metabolic rate when resting on water, during diving and after feeding was significantly elevated when compared with the resting-in-air rate. During diving, the metabolic rate of post-absorptive shags increased to 22.66 W kg(-1), which corresponds to 4.8 X BMR. Minimum cost of transport (COT) was calculated at 17.8 J kg(-1) m(-1) at a swim speed of 1.3 m s(-1). Feeding before diving elevated diving metabolic rate by 13 for up to 5 h. There was a significant relationship between diving metabolic rate and water temperature, where metabolic rate increased as water temperature declined. Thermal conductance when resting in air at 10-19 degrees C was 2.05 W m(-2) degrees C-1 and quadrupled during diving (7.88 W m(-2) degrees C-1). Stomach temperature when resting in air during the day was 40.6 degrees C and increased during activity. In dive trials lasting up to 50 min, stomach temperature fluctuated around a peak value of 42.0 degrees C. Hence, there is no evidence that European shags might employ a strategy of regional hypothermia. The energetic costs during shallow diving in European shags are considerably lower than has previously been reported for great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and are comparable to other foot-propelled divers. The lower dive costs in shags might be the consequence of a more streamlined body shape reducing hydrodynamic costs as well as a greater insulative plumage air layer (estimated to be 2.71 mm), which reduces thermoregulatory costs. The latter might be of great importance for shags especially during winter when they spend extended periods foraging in cold water.",,,,,"Gremillet, David/W-1946-2018","Gremillet, David/0000-0002-7711-9398",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,SEP,2005,208,18,,,,,3451,3461,,10.1242/jeb.01791,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.01791,,,,,,,,16155218,,,,,WOS:000232546800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The complexity of managing N and water in these systems is increasingly being aided by the use of crop models which require quantitative estimates of the various components of growth. A study to predict plant leaf area (PLA) of 3 tropical forage legumes as a function of temperature under irrigated conditions was conducted at Gatton, south-eastern Queensland. The legumes were phasey bean [Macroptilium lathyroides (L.) Urban.], vigna [Vigna trilobata (L.) Verdc.], and sesbania (Sesbania cannabina Retz.). The PLA was to be predicted by establishing a relationship between plastochron index (PI) and accumulated thermal time, and then between PLA and PI. Daily rate of increase in PI (DIPI) was strongly related to accumulated thermal time in all species, with DIPI higher for phasey bean (0.51 degree-days) and sesbania (0.54 degree-days) than for vigna (0.14 degree-days). At a plant density of 50 plants/m(2), the relationship between PI and PLA was largely dependent upon the proportion of PLA originating from branches rather than from the main stem. In sesbania, <20% of the PLA was contributed from leaves originating from branches, compared with about 40% in phasey bean and about 75% in vigna. The slope of the linear component of the relationship between PLA and PI in sesbania (85 cm(2)) was slightly less than the maximum leaf area per node recorded. The comparable slope for phasey bean was 57 cm(2), being greater than the area of any individual leaf (40-50 cm(2)) because of the greater contribution of leaves originating from branches. In vigna, the very large contribution of leaves originating from branches to PLA, together with the slower DIPI for that species, resulted in the relationship between PI and PLA being much steeper than in either of the other species. The parameters developed for each species were successfully validated using independent data from other experiments in south-eastern Queensland. Increase in PLA in response to accumulated thermal time can be successfully predicted for these 3 tropical legumes at the set plant density. The successful prediction of PLA for legumes with a high degree of branching is of special significance, as it indicates that these methods may have application in predicting leaf growth in legumes which are being grazed and which have a number of active growing points. Nevertheless, the stability of the derived parameters needs to be assessed under a range of plant densities before they can be widely used to predict leaf area development in ley legumes.",,,,,"Pengelly, Bruce/D-6994-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-9409,,,,,,1999,50,2,,,,,253,259,,10.1071/A98055,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/A98055,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000078800600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examined the effects of water temperature and food resource gradients on the growth rate of zooplankton undergoing vertical migration in Lake Michigan. In three laboratory experiments, juvenile Daphnia mendotae, native herbivorous cladocerans, were incubated for 5 days at water temperatures associated with the epilimnion and deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) of Lake Michigan and were fed food resources collected directly from these regions. Growth rate strongly depended on water temperature, as Daphnia incubated at the epilimnetic temperature (21 degrees C) grew 42% faster than those at the DCM temperature (8 degrees C). Growth rate of Daphnia that alternated between the two temperatures every 12 h (0.108 day(-1)) was similar to the arithmetic average growth rate of the two water temperature treatment extremes (0.110 day(-1)), suggesting fluctuating temperatures alone do not substantially influence Daphnia growth. In contrast, food resources derived from different depths did not affect growth rate, nor was there a significant interaction between food resource origin and water temperature effects. Our results indicate that vertical migration will reduce growth rate, and hence zooplankton production, through reduced temperature, not from changes in resources. Consideration of the effects of vertical migration, especially given the known variability in this behavior, may substantially improve zooplankton production estimates in the Great Lakes.

The Met Office Unified Model (UM) has a significant cold LST bias in semi-arid regions when compared with satellite observations; a range of UM configurations were assessed with different model resolutions, land surface cover datasets and bare soil parameterisations. UM LST biases were evaluated at global resolution and in a limited area model (LAM) at a 2.2 km resolution over the SALSTICE (Semi-Arid Land Surface Temperature and IASI Calibration Experiment) experimental domain in south-eastern Arizona. This validation is in conjunction with eddy-covariance flux tower measurements. LST biases in the Global Atmosphere/Land 3.1 (GA/L3.1) configuration were largest in the mid-morning with respect to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra (-13.6 +/- 2.8 K at the Kendall Grassland site). The diurnal cycle of LST in Global Atmosphere/Land 6.1 (GA/L6.1) showed a significant improvement relative to GA/L3.1 with the cold LST biases reduced to -1.4 +/- 2.7K and -3.6 +/- 3.0 K for Terra and Aqua overpasses, respectively. The higher-resolution LAM showed added value over the global configurations. The spatial distribution of the LST biases relative to MODIS and the modelled bare soil cover fraction were found to be moderately correlated (0.61 +/- 0.08) during the daytime, which suggests that regions of cold LST bias are associated with low bare soil cover fraction. Coefficients of correlation with the shrub surface fractions followed the same trend as the bare soil cover fraction, although with a less significant correlation (0.36 +/- 0.09), and indicated that the sparse vegetation canopies in south-eastern Arizona are not well represented in UM ancillary datasets. The x component of the orographic slope was positively correlated with the LST bias (0.41 +/- 0.05 for MODIS Aqua) and identified that regions of cold model LST bias are found on easterly slopes, and regions of warm model LST bias are found on westerly slopes.

Previous studies and industry experience suggest that there has already been an effect of warmer temperatures on grapevine phenology; harvest dates have advanced and vintages have become shorter over the past 30 years in Australia. In addition, increasing [CO2] in the atmosphere will likely alter grapevine growth, development, and grape quality. Understanding the interactive effects of [CO2] and temperature on grapevines is essential to determine the potential impact of future climate on grape phenology, grape composition, and final wine quality. Open-top chambers (OTC), capable of maintaining air temperature 2 degrees C above ambient throughout the diurnal cycle using an active heating system and fan-assisted air circulation, were established in an experimental vineyard managed to current commercial practice. A system was then developed to elevate atmospheric [CO2] to 650 mu mol mol(-1) around the grapevines within the OTC. The main engineering goal of the system was to maintain an even temporal and spatial distribution of CO2. Monitoring showed that the mean daytime [CO2] at the center of each OTC varied between 620 and 665 mu mol mol(-1) maintaining [CO2] at or above 95.4% of the target [CO2] and not exceeding the target by more than 2.3%, meeting the performance criteria of within +/- 10% of the target concentration. Both the temporal and spatial distributions of [CO2] were more even in heated OTCs than non-heated OTCs. In all heated OTCs, the [CO2] was at or above 90% of the target and within aL10% of the target at all locations assessed (spatial distribution). The mean [CO2] was between 80% and 86% of the target at 40% of locations in OTCs without heating; however, the overall mean [CO2] in the OTCs was 97.5% of the target. The system performed satisfactorily over a wide range of temperatures (20 degrees C to 50 degrees C), with overall standard deviation varying between 85 and 112 mu mol mol(-1). This indicates that the CO2 injection system showed satisfactory performance in controlling [CO2] at the center of each OTC and providing confidence in the results that will be generated from experiments using the system.

However, little is known about the plant physiological response to climate change. Results Here, we select the Kobresia pygmaea, an important perennial Cyperaceae forage, to examine the physiological indices to temperature changes in different growing months. We determined the contents of malondialdehyde, proline, soluble sugars, superoxide dismutase, peroxidation, and catalase activity in leaves and roots of Kobresia pygmaea at 25celcius, 10celcius, 4celcius and 0celcius from June to September in 2020. The results showed that the content of osmotic adjustment substances in the leaves and roots of Kobresia pygmaea fluctuated greatly with experimental temperature in June and September. The superoxide dismutase activity in the leaves and roots of the four months changed significantly with temperatures. The peroxidation activity in the leaves was higher than that in the roots, while the catalase activity in leaves and roots fluctuates greatly during June, with a relative stable content in other months. Membership function analysis showed that higher temperatures were more harmful to plant leaves, and lower temperatures were more harmful to plant roots. The interaction of organs, growing season and stress temperature significantly affected the physiological indicators. Conclusions The physiological indicators of Kobresia pygmaea can actively respond to temperature changes, and high temperature can reduce the stress resistance Kobresia pygmaea.

In two greenhouse experiments stabilization of root zone temperatures, fluctuating between 43.3 and 8.3 degrees C in the summer and 27.8 and 8.5 degrees C in the winter, close to 20 degrees C resulted in consistently lower proline levels in leaves. But even in the case of stabilized root zone temperatures different proline levels were determined for the two experiments and a large temporal variation was observed during the winter experiment. Correlation analyses indicated, that the higher proline levels for the fluctuating root zone temperatures in the summer were mainly caused by low night temperatures. The chilling stress potential of the low temperatures became evident in a short-term experiment, where a continuous relative increase of proline level up to 300 % of the control (20 degrees C) was obtained after a cold treatment of roots (10 degrees C) for two days. Stabilization of root zone temperatures slightly increased the cutting yield only in the winter experiment. Mean proline levels and mean numbers of cuttings per harvest date of both experiments combined with the data of earlier experiments followed a consistent non-linear dose relationship indicating a mean proline threshold range for the reduction for the investigated cultivar.

When calculated over the whole duration (24 h) of the field soil-warming experiment, temperature sensitivities of R-A and R-H were similar (no significant difference at P < 0.05); Q(10) values were 3.16 and 3.96 for R-A and 2.94 and 3.35 for R-H calculated with soil temperatures at 1 and 5 cm soil depth, respectively. Laboratory incubation showed that different soil moisture contents of trenched and control plots affected rates of R-H, but did not affect the temperature sensitivity of R-H. We conclude that a single parameter is sufficient to describe the temperature sensitivity of R-S in soil C models which operate on larger temporal and spatial scales. The strong short-term response of R-A may be of relevance in soils suspected to experience increasingly strong diurnal temperature variations.",,,,,"Kitzler, Barbara/ACM-1987-2022; Zechmeister-Boltenstern, Sophie/L-4186-2018","Zechmeister-Boltenstern, Sophie/0000-0001-5839-5904; Kitzler, Barbara/0000-0002-1617-9186",,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,1573-5036,,,,FEB,2008,303,1-2,,,,,323,330,,10.1007/s11104-007-9511-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-007-9511-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000252800000026,View Full Record in Web of Science

This can be especially challenging during situations of fluctuating cold temperatures and food scarcity, but phenotypic plasticity may offer an adaptive advantage during these periods. We examined how lifespan, fecundity, pre-oviposition periods, and body nutrient contents were affected by dietary protein and carbohydrate (P:C) ratios at variable low temperatures in two morphs (winter morphs WM and summer morphs SM) of an invasive fly, Drosophila suzukii. The experimental conditions simulated early spring after overwintering and autumn, crucial periods for survival. At lower temperatures, post-overwintering WM lived longer on carbohydrate-only diets and had higher fecundity on low-protein diets, but there was no difference in lifespan or fecundity among diets for SM. As temperatures increased, low-protein diets resulted in higher fecundity without compromising lifespan, while high-protein diets reduced lifespan and fecundity for both WM and SM. Both SM and WM receiving high-protein diets had lower sugar, lipid, and glycogen (but similar protein) body contents compared to flies receiving low-protein and carbohydrate-only diets. This suggests that flies spend energy excreting excess dietary protein, thereby affecting lifespan and fecundity. Despite having to recover from nutrient depletion after an overwintering period, WM exhibited longer lifespan and higher fecundity than SM in favorable diets and temperatures. WM exposed to favorable low-protein diet had higher body sugar, lipid, and protein body contents than SM, which is possibly linked to better performance. Although protein is essential for oogenesis, WM and SM flies receiving low-protein diets did not have shorter pre-oviposition periods compared to flies on carbohydrate-only diets. Finding adequate carbohydrate sources to compensate protein intake is essential for the successful persistence of D. suzukii WM and SM populations during suboptimal temperatures.",,,,,"Souza, Ivana/GSN-3243-2022","Souza, Ivana/0000-0001-5618-6578",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,MAR,2019,9,5,,,,,2615,2628,,10.1002/ece3.4928,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4928,,,,,,,,31061698,,,,,WOS:000460668800021,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this purpose, Sarcophaga (Liopygia) argyrostoma (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830), a forensically important species has been chosen. Whether the constant (25 degrees C) and fluctuating (25.2 degrees C averaged over natural conditions) temperatures would make a difference on the timing of intrapuparial development of this species was investigated. First larval instars were placed in rearing cages until they reached post-feeding third larval instar, which is considered the beginning of intrapuparial development. Relevant morphological changes were observed by hourly dissections. At fluctuating temperature treatment, the post-feeding third instar larvae were transferred to containers under natural, open-air conditions. Minimum and maximum starting times of 23 intrapuparial development periods were determined for both treatments. These times, medians, and standard deviations were compared by Mann-Whitney U tests. Accumulated degree hour values were also calculated for these periods. Regardless of temperature treatment, intrapuparial development periods were similar and adult emergence was observed at 289.5 ( +/- 1.52) h under 25 degrees C constant temperature and 319 ( +/- 1.41) h under fluctuating temperature conditions. No statistical difference was found between the intrapuparial development of S. argyrostoma reared under constant and fluctuating temperatures, except pupal-adult apolysis and checkered pattern on the abdomen becoming distinct periods.

Infested fish with sea lice reduces appetite, food-conversion efficiency and increase stress level, which results in decreased growth. The skin wounds, caused by the ectoparasite feeding, leave fish exposed to secondary infections and antiparasitics treatment expenses are high. To evaluate the impact of environmental variables on the early development of C. rogercresseyi, egg strings were obtained from mature females (reared in laboratory conditions) and exposed to different combinations of salinity (14, 20, 26 and 32 PSU) and temperature (6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 degrees C). The hatching success and time, pelagic life time, survival and size of nauplius I, nauplius II and copepodid were quantified. Our results indicate that salinity and temperature have a significant effect on the hatching success of this parasite. Salinities between 26 and 32 PSU result in a hatching success of 100%, whereas lower salinities (14 PSU) reduce hatching success by 60% (at all experimental temperatures) generating an increase in mortality of these early developmental stages. A temperature reduction from 18 degrees C to 6 degrees C in culture conditions significantly extended the incubation time of C. rogercresseyi by 50%. Specifically, temperature had a higher impact on nauplius I and nauplius II larvae, increasing development times to 50 and 100 h respectively, when temperature was decreased to 6 degrees C. Although combination of salinity and temperature have a significant effect on hatching time and survival in C. rogercresseyi, the combination of these variables had no impact on the size of nauplius I, nauplius II and copepodid stage. Thus, the effects on the survival and pelagic life time of the early stage of C. rogercresseyi, might substantially affect the fitness of the species under fluctuating conditions of salinity and temperature.",,,,,"Montory, Jaime/AAL-5187-2020; Gebauer, Paulina/D-8661-2013","Montory, Jaime/0000-0003-3383-7467; Gebauer, Paulina/0000-0001-8319-9868",,,,,,,,,,,,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,,,FEB 3,2018,486,,,,,,68,74,,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.12.017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.12.017,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000425875900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within these, protozoa play an important role in structuring planktonic food webs and sequestering CO2. We hypothesized that short-term (similar to 20 days) fluctuations, of 2-10 degrees C, will significantly alter carbon flux associated with predator-prey interactions within the microbial planktonic food web. We examined the model ciliate, Urotricha farcta, which is abundant and common; it was fed the autotrophic flagellate Cryptomonas sp., which is also common. Laboratory experiments were conducted over relevant ranges: 8-24 degrees C; 0-2 x 10(5) prey mL(-1). Mechanistic-phenomenological multiple regressions were developed and fit to the data to obtain relationships for (1) growth rate and volume changes of the flagellate vs. temperature and (2) growth rates, grazing, and cell volume change of the ciliate vs. temperature and prey concentration. Responses revealed interaction between temperature and prey levels on all ciliate parameters, indicating it is inappropriate to apply simple temperature corrections (e.g. Q(10)) to such functions. The potential impact of such temperature changes on carbon flux was illustrated using a simple ciliate-flagellate predator-prey model, with and without the top grazer, Daphnia, added. The model indicated that predator-prey pulses occurred over 20 days, with the ciliate controlling the prey population. For ciliates and prey, carbon production peaked at 20 degrees C and rapidly decreased above and below this maximum; differences between minimum and maximum were approximately fourfold, for both prey and ciliate, with low levels at 25-30 degrees C and 10-15 degrees C. Including literature data to parameterize, the influence of the grazer Daphnia did not alter the prediction that the ciliate may control short-term flagellate pulses and temperature will influence these in a nonintuitive fashion.",,,,,"Atkinson, David/D-4664-2009; Atkinson, David/Q-6933-2019","Atkinson, David/0000-0002-9956-2454; Atkinson, David/0000-0002-9956-2454; Weisse, Thomas/0000-0001-6103-6558",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,DEC,2008,14,12,,,,,2823,2838,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01700.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01700.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000261061000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The canopy of each vine was enclosed in an open-system gas exchange cuvette, and a computer-controlled sampling and logging system enabled multiplexed analysis of gas exchange rates for each vine. The canopy leaf area, estimated on five occasions, increased on average from 0.25 m2 m-2 at 15 days after bud burst to 2.39 m2 m-2 at 85 days after bud burst. Inter-vine differences in leaf area were consistent throughout the measurement period. Diurnal integrals of quantum flux density (Q), measured above the canopy within the cuvette, varied from 9 to 56 mumol m-2 day-1, and did not show a clear tendency to increase with increasing daylength towards the summer solstice. Mean daily air temperatures within the cuvettes tended to increase during the measurment period, from 12-14-degrees-C soon after bud burst to 15-21-degrees-C near the summer solstice. Diel integrals of canopy A tended to increase during the measurment period, from ca -0.7 mumol CO2 m-2 day-1 soon after bud burst to as high as 1.4 mumol CO2 m-2 day-1 near the summer solstice. Inter-vine differences at any stage of the season were related to differences in leaf area. The temporal trend for increasing diel integrals of canopy A during spring followed the increasing leaf area, although large day-to-day differences at any stage of the season could be associated with concomitantly varying diurnal integrals of Q. The temporal trend of increasing canopy A was almost entirely due to increasing day-time A, as night-time A (negative) changed relatively little during the measurement period. Asymptotic exponential curves were used to describe the relationship between instantaneous Q and canopy A at three stages of the season. These relationships indicated that the initial response of canopy A to increasing incident Q (the apparent quantum yield) was 0.03, 0.07 and 0.08 mol CO2 mol-1 Q at ca 35, 55 and 85 days after bud burst, respectively. The quantum saturated rate of canopy A at any stage, however, responded significantly to inter-vine differences in leaf area, ranging from 9.6 to 11.9 mumol CO2 m-2 s-1 at ca 35 days after bud burst, 25.7-29.7 mumol CO2 m-2 s-1 at ca 55 days after bud burst, and 29.0-37.8 mumol CO2 m-2 s-1 at 85 days after bud burst.

However, downscaling predicted ecological effects of climate change to local scales and individual species comprises a key knowledge gap. As temperature modifies both abiotic and biotic processes, the fate of refugial populations may depend on interactions of temperature with susceptibility of organisms to other factors, rather than on the impact of temperature alone. To explore this, we examined whether temperature regulates the sensitivity to hypoxia of an aquatic glacial relict, Mysis salemaai, an opossum shrimp.

MethodsWe used laboratory experiments to determine thermal sensitivity of M.salemaai and quantify the effect of temperature on survival and regulation of aerobic metabolism in progressive hypoxia. The resulting temperature and oxygen sensitivity thresholds were then validated in the field. ResultsSurvival of M.salemaai in reduced oxygen conditions was significantly lower at higher temperatures, even though the tested temperature range did not cause mortality on its own. Results of respiration assays suggest that this was a consequence of impaired capacity at elevated temperatures for regulating oxygen uptake in hypoxic conditions.

Flow reduction due to water abstraction, elevated levels of nutrients and chemical contaminants are common agricultural stressors worldwide. Concurrently, stream ecosystems are also increasingly affected by climate change. Interactions among multiple co-occurring stressors result in biological responses that cannot be predicted from single-stressor effects (i.e. synergisms and antagonisms). At the ecosystem level, multiple-stressor effects can be further modified by biotic interactions (e.g. trophic interactions). We conducted a field experiment using 128 flow-through stream mesocosms to examine the individual and combined effects of water abstraction, nutrient enrichment and elevated levels of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) on survival, condition and gut content of juvenile brown trout and on benthic abundance of their invertebrate prey. Flow velocity reduction decreased fish survival (-12% compared to controls) and condition (-8% compared to initial condition), whereas effects of nutrient and DCD additions and interactions among these stressors were not significant. Negative effects of flow velocity reduction on fish survival and condition were consistent with effects on fish gut content (-25% compared to controls) and abundance of dominant invertebrate prey (-30% compared to controls), suggesting a negative metabolic balance driving fish mortality and condition decline, which was confirmed by structural equation modelling. Fish mortality under reduced flow velocity increased as maximal daily water temperatures approached the upper limit of their tolerance range, reflecting synergistic interactions between these stressors. Our study highlights the importance of indirect stressor effects such as those transferred through trophic interactions, which need to be considered when assessing and managing fish populations and stream food webs in multiple-stressor situations. However, in real streams, compensatory mechanisms and behavioural responses, as well as seasonal and spatial variation, may alter the intensity of stressor effects and the sensitivity of trout populations.",,,,,"Salis, Romana Katerina/J-4374-2019; Bruder, Andreas/AFC-9051-2022","Bruder, Andreas/0000-0002-4591-491X; Salis, Romana/0000-0001-7724-4984; Jones, Peter/0000-0002-1432-3826",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,SEP,2017,23,9,,,,,3882,3894,,10.1111/gcb.13696,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13696,,,,,,,,28323368,,,,,WOS:000406812100037,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increasing the duration of the single 35 degrees C temperature pulse from 30 minutes to 12 hours did not increase budbreak. Even a 3-minute 35 degrees C pulse caused 63% budbreak. A single gradual shift (0.02 degrees C per minute) from 20 to 35 degrees C was as effective as a rapid shift (0.5 degrees C per minute) in stimulating budbreak. Nonsprouted tubers preincubated at 25 degrees C were stimulated to cause budbreak by exposure at 35 degrees C for 12 hours, but not at 15 degrees C for 12 hours. A single temperature pulse of at least 10 degrees C differential (from 20 to 30, 35, or 40 degrees C) stimulated budbreak, while a 5 degrees C differential (from 20 to 25 degrees C) did not; all pulses had the same heat unit (degrees C >20 degrees C x time (minutes)=3600 degrees C/minute).

Earthworm mass, surface casting and burrowing activities were affected significantly by soil temperature, moisture and the temperature-moisture interaction. Burrow Length and maximum burrow depth increased with increasing temperature, but there was less burrowing in wetter soil (-5 kPa) than drier soil. (-11 kPa). Weight gain and surface casting, however, were greater in soil at -5 kPa than -11 kPa. Our results suggest more intensive feeding and limited burrowing in wetter soil than drier soil. Earthworms inhabiting the non-compacted, drier soil may have pushed aside particles without ingesting them to create burrows.

Understanding how these variations in ocean temperature affect processes such as metabolism and energy consumption is important for many species, and may be particularly important for sedentary species that cannot make large-scale movements in response to changes in environmental conditions. We examined how metabolic rates and energetic demands responded to temperature in a temperate reef fish, the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli). Using respirometry, we estimated resting oxygen consumption (V02) for 42 L. dalli individuals of varying sizes and calculated metabolic rates (MR) at three different temperatures (13 degrees C, 16 degrees C, and 20 degrees C). As predicted, V02 and MR increased significantly with temperature and mass, but the rate of temperature-dependent increase in metabolism indicated a very high degree of thermal sensitivity for L. dalli (Q10 value for VO2 was 5.21 across the range of experimental temperatures). The mass-scaling exponent (b) was estimated to be 0.95 and aligned closely with other benthic species. Our results suggest that changes in temperature especially those that occur over weeks and seasons likely play a significant role in the ecology of these gobies.

The infrared (IR) heating technique used in terrestrial vegetation warming experiments has been continuously improved over the past two decades, but the temperature control methods applied thus far inadequately reflect natural conditions. 2. Current control methods base the IR radiation administered on measured canopy or air temperatures. However, these temperatures are influenced by stomatal responses of the vegetation, which depend on moisture conditions and therefore also on warming. In nature, drought-stressed vegetation warms up more than well-watered vegetation, leading to potential differences in heat stress. Current control methods preclude such differences from developing. 3. We propose an alternative approach to render temperature control independent of plant responses. Theoretical canopy temperatures associated with given (target) air temperatures are calculated, based on reference canopy conductance determined from controls and fluctuating meteorological conditions. The IR radiation needed to attain the theoretical temperature is subsequently applied. Actual canopy and air temperatures are free to deviate from that temperature, as measured temperatures no longer control the heaters' radiation output. 4. Synthesis. We devised an alternative control method for IR heaters that is independent of plant responses to heating.

Core body temperatures were 0.7-1.7 degrees C higher than ambient water temperatures and were kept relatively constant. Unsteady numerical simulations using a spherical thermodynamic model provided mechanistic explanations for these phenomena, and the body temperature responses to fluctuating water temperature can be simply explained by a large body mass with a constant thermal diffusivity and a heat production rate rather than physiological thermoregulation. By contrast, body temperatures increased 2.6-5.1 degrees C in 107-152 min during their emergences to nest on land. The estimated heat production rates on land were 7.4-10.5 times the calculated values in the sea. The theoretical prediction that temperature difference between body and water temperatures would increase according to the body size was confirmed by empirical data recorded from several species of sea turtles.

We tested hypotheses concerning the effects of feeding, season, sex, and reproductive condition on thermoregulation of individuals. The mean preferred body temperature (PBT) for captive snakes from the study population was 27.1 degrees C, similar to that reported for other populations, and PET range (defined as the 25th-75th percentiles of selected temperatures) was 25-30 degrees C. When environmental conditions allowed, the mean and range of body temperature (T-b) of free-living snakes were nearly identical to those observed in captivity. The typical daily pattern in snake T-b was an increase in late morning to a plateau temperature in the preferred range, followed by a decrease in the evening with a nightime plateau at approximately the temperature of the water. We calculated indices of thermoregulation to relate T-b data to available ambient temperatures. Despite the northern latitude of the study population, ambient conditions were favorable over much of the activity season and offered the potential for the snakes to maintain T-b within the PET range almost 24 h per day for much of the season. However, the thermoregulation indices indicated that N. sipedon are only moderate thermoregulators, and often do not exploit opportunities to achieve PET, particularly during the day. Variation in annual ambient temperatures affected growth rates of the snakes, and was sufficient to affect the age of maturity of females. Feeding did not elicit a thermophilic response under laboratory conditions or when snakes were fed experimentally in the field, suggesting that the benefits of increasing T-b after eating did not outweigh the costs. Reproductive females thermoregulated more carefully than nonreproductive females during the July-August gestation period. Pregnant females may increase thermoregulatory behavior to enhance the rate and efficiency of embryogenesis. Males thermoregulated less than both reproductive and nonreproductive females, particularly later in the activity season when thermoregulation by females increased. We hypothesized that males pursue a survival strategy following the spring mating season and thus remain cool and secretive during the later part of the activity season. This strategy by males clearly contributes to their slowed growth and smaller size relative to females.",,,,,"Brown, Gregory P./F-9897-2011","Brown, Gregory P./0000-0002-2924-9040",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,,,MAY,2000,70,2,,,,,311,330,,10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0311:TEASSD]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9615(2000)070[0311:TEASSD]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000086984100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

A growing number of recent studies have shown beneficial effects of exposing insects to recurrent brief warm pulses during low-temperature stress (fluctuating thermal regime, FTR). The physiological underpinnings of the beneficial effects of FTR on cold survival have been extensively studied over the past few years. Profiling with various '-omics' techniques has provided supporting evidence for different physiological responses between insects exposed to FTR and constant low temperature. Evidence from transcriptomic, metabolomic and lipidomic studies points to a system-wide loss of homeostasis at low temperature that can be counterbalanced by repair mechanisms under FTR. Although there has been considerable progress in understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of FTR, here we discuss how many areas still lack clarity, such as the precise role(s) of heat shock proteins, compatible solutes or the identification of regulators and key players involved in the observed homeostatic responses. FTR can be particularly beneficial in applied settings, such as for model insects used in research, integrated pest management and pollination services. We also explain how the application of FTR techniques in large-scale facilities may require overcoming some logistical and technical constraints. FTR definitively enhances survival at low temperature in insects, but before it can be widely used, we suggest that the possible fitness and energy costs of FTR must be explored more thoroughly.

However, we know little about the interactive effects of both stressors and in particular about the interaction of increased climatic variability and biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning. This should be remedied because larger climatic variability is one of the main features of climate change. Here, we demonstrated that temperature fluctuations led to changes in the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning. We used microcosm communities of different phytoplankton species richness and exposed them to a constant, mild, and severe temperature-fluctuating environment. Wider temperature fluctuations led to steeper biodiversity-ecosystem functioning slopes, meaning that species loss had a stronger negative effect on ecosystem functioning in more fluctuating environments. For severe temperature fluctuations, the slope increased through time due to a decrease of the productivity of species-poor communities over time. We developed a theoretical competition model to better understand our experimental results and showed that larger differences in thermal tolerances across species led to steeper biodiversity- ecosystem functioning slopes. Species-rich communities maintained their ecosystem functioning with increased fluctuation as they contained species able to resist the thermally fluctuating environments, while this was on average not the case in species-poor communities.

One (IDMT model) is based on the integrated daily mean temperature, and the other (IDMR model) on the integrated daily mean rate. The IDMT model predicts that vertical migration causes no difference in either daily growth or daily metabolism. The IDMR model suggests that daily growth will increase by a factor of 1.04, and metabolism by a factor of 1.58. Because of the small difference between the models in respect of growth, the experimental results are consonant with either. Experiments support the IDMT model results for daily metabolism. The results are discussed in light of existing views of physiological rate processes of vertical migrators and regarding the adaptive theory of vertical migration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0142-7873,,,,,JUL,1992,14,7,,,,,925,935,,10.1093/plankt/14.7.925,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/14.7.925,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JD90700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results indicate that C. psychrerythraea 34H is capable of chemotaxis at all temperatures tested, with strongest chemotaxis at the temperature at which it was first grown, whether 8 degrees C or -1 degrees C. This model marine psychrophile also showed significant halotaxis towards 15 and 55 ppt solutions, as well as strong substrate-specific chemohalotaxis.

In adulthood, however, individuals incubated at cycling temperatures had significantly lower immune function than control birds but did not differ from individuals incubated at constant low temperatures.

The pattern in the response of unrestricted yeast S. cerevisiae culture to changes in the temperature of cultivation is revealed experimentally. Yeast population, in the absence of environmental constraints on the functioning of cell chemosmotic bioenergetic system, demonstrates the ability of thermoresistance when the temperature of cultivation switches from the range of 12-36 degrees C to 37.5-40 degrees C. During the transient period that is associated with the temperature switching and lasts from 1 to 4 turnover cycles, yeast reproduction rate remains 1.5-2 times higher than under stationary conditions. This is due to evolutionary acquired adaptive activity of cell chemosmotic system. After the adaptive resources exhausting, yeast thermoresistance fully recovers at the temperature range of 12-36 degrees C within one generation time under conditions of both restricted and unrestricted nourishment.

Furthermore, since most experiments utilize constant temperature incubation treatments to explore phenotypic response to temperature, few studies have addressed the consequences of incubation under natural conditions. In this study I utilized constant-temperature laboratory incubations and natural-nest incubations to determine the effects of temperature on sex, size, growth, and locomotor performance in the tortoise Gopherus polyphemus. Constant-temperature incubations do induce substantial growth and performance variation in these tortoises.

However, culture temperatures used to demonstrate the effects of heat on development have been higher than the body temperatures experienced typically by heat-stressed cows. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposing bovine oocytes and embryos to temperatures characteristic of body temperatures of heat-stressed cows would affect embryonic development in vitro. The CO2 percentage of the gas phase was adjusted in all experiments to prevent pH changes in the medium caused by decreased solubility of CO2 at high temperatures. Fertilization of oocytes at 41.0 degreesC reduced cleavage rate and the percentage of oocytes that became blastocysts compared with at 38.5 degreesC. There was no deleterious effect of fertilization at 40.0 degreesC. When putative zygotes and two-cell embryos were exposed to a range of temperatures from 38.5 to 41.0 degreesC for 3, 6, 9 or 12 h, heat shock reduced the number that developed to the blastocyst stage but only after exposure to 41.0 degreesC for 9 or 12 h, In addition, it was tested whether low O-2 tension would reduce the detrimental effects of heat shock. The deleterious effect of 41.0 degreesC was not dependent upon oxygen content or the gas mixture used for culture (5% versus 20.35% O-2), indicating that the deleterious effects of heat shock did not depend upon a high O-2 environment. In the final experiment, embryos were exposed to 24h fluctuations in temperature designed to mimic the rectal temperatures of cows exposed to heat stress. Exposure of embryos to this pattern of temperatures starting after fertilization reduced development when embryos were exposed to this environment for 8 days but not when embryos were exposed for 1 day only. These findings indicate that embryonic development can be disrupted by a short-term severe or a prolonged mild heat shock and that the effects of heat shock are not artefacts of changes in pH or high oxygen tension.",,,,,,"Rivera, Rocio Melissa/0000-0002-9832-9618",,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-1626,,,,,JAN,2001,121,1,,,,,107,115,,10.1530/rep.0.1210107,http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.0.1210107,,,,,,,,11226033,,,,,WOS:000168328900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our model predicts that shifts in thermal opportunities resulting from climate change alter energy intake primarily through digestion rather than feeding, because simulated lizards were able to fill their gut faster than they can digest their food. Moreover, since rates of energy assimilation decelerate with increasing thermal opportunity, shifts in daily energetic assimilation would depend on the previous opportunity for thermoregulation. In particular, the same changes in thermal opportunity will have little impact on lizards from warm locations, while having a large impact on lizards from cold locations where thermoregulation is possible for only a few hours each day. Energy expenditure followed spatial patterns in thermal opportunity, with greater annual energy expenditure occurring at warmer locations. Our model predicts that lizards will spend more energy under climate change by maintaining higher body temperatures and remaining active longer. However, the predicted changes in energy assimilation following climate change greatly exceeded the predicted increases in energy expenditure. Simple models, which assume constant rates of energy gain during activity, will potentially mislead efforts to understand and predict the biological impacts of climate change.",,,,,"Buckley, Lauren/ABD-6759-2021; Levy, Ofir/H-6217-2013","Buckley, Lauren/0000-0003-1315-3818; Levy, Ofir/0000-0003-0920-1207",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,MAY,2017,98,5,,,,,1217,1228,,10.1002/ecy.1803,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1803,,,,,,,,28328067,,,,,WOS:000400598500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hydrothermal vents in Tutum Bay, Ambitle Island, Papua New Guinea, occur at depths of 10 m and are surrounded by a tropical fringing coral reef. Live specimens of seven species of larger benthic foraminifers were collected from a nearby reef location, placed in small mesh bags, and deployed for five days at six different sites along a gradient of temperature (60-29 degrees C) and pH (5.9-8.1). Foraminiferal species that differ in shell structure (porcelaneous vs. hyaline) and composition (high- and intermediate-Mg calcite) were used in the experiment. Approximately 25% of the specimens, representing four of the seven species, retained normal symbiont color and exhibited minimal dissolution when exposed for five days to temperatures up to 60 degrees C and pH as low as 6.2; shells of specimens that lost symbiont color during deployment exhibited extensive corrosion. More than 80% of the specimens, representing at least one of each species, retained normal symbiont color where the temperature was approximately 40 degrees C and pH fluctuated between 5.9 and 7.4.

Here, we show for the first time that normal within-daytime fluctuations in temperature of less than 3 degrees C have large effects on personality for two species of juvenile coral reef fish in both observational and manipulative experiments. On average, individual scores on three personality traits (PTs), activity, boldness and aggressiveness, increased from 2.5- to sixfold as a function of temperature. However, whereas most individuals became more active, aggressive and bold across temperature contexts (were plastic), others did not; this changed the individual rank order across temperatures and thus altered personality. In addition, correlations between PTs were consistent across temperature contexts, e. g. fish that were active at a given temperature also tended to be both bold and aggressive. These results (i) highlight the importance of very carefully controlling for temperature when studying behavioural variation among and within individuals and (ii) suggest that individual differences in energy metabolism may contribute to animal personality, given that temperature has large direct effects on metabolic rates in ectotherms.",,,,,"Biro, Peter/D-4327-2009; Stamps, Judy A/A-5142-2010; Beckmann, Christa/G-2754-2012","Beckmann, Christa/0000-0002-7904-7228; Biro, Peter/0000-0002-3565-240X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,,,,,JAN 7,2010,277,1678,,,,,71,77,,10.1098/rspb.2009.1346,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2009.1346,,,,,,,,19793748,,,,,WOS:000272028900011,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, the low nest temperatures associated with cold climate habitats are thought to be detrimental to the developing embryos or hatchlings of oviparous squamates, providing a selective advantage for the retention of developing eggs in utero, where the mother can provide warmer incubation temperatures for her eggs (By actively thermoregulating) than they would experience in a nest. However, it is not entirely clear M-hat detrimental effects cold incubation temperatures may have on eggs and hatchlings, and what role these effects may play in favouring the evolution of viviparity. Previous workers have suggested that viviparity may be favoured in cold climates because cold incubation temperatures slow embryogenesis and delay hatching of the eggs, or because cold nest temperatures are lethal to developing eggs and reduce hatching success. However, incubation temperature has also been shown to have other, potentially long-term, effects on hatchling phenotypes, suggesting that cold climates may favour viviparity because cold incubation temperatures produce offspring of poor quality or low fitness. We experimentally incubated eggs of the oviparous phrynosomatid lizard, Sceloporus virgatus, at temperatures simulating nests in a warm (low elevation) habitat, as is typical for this species, and nests in a colder (high elevation) habitat, to determine the effects of cold incubation temperatures on embryonic development and hatchling phenotypes. Incubation at cold nest temperatures slowed embryonic development and reduced hatching success, but also affected many aspects of the hatchlings' phenotypes. Overall, the directions of these plastic responses indicated that cold-incubated hatchlings did indeed exhibit poorer quality phenotypes; they were smaller at hatching (in body length) and at 20 days of age (in length and mass), grew more slowly (in length and mass), had lower survival rates, and showed greater fluctuating asymmetry than their conspecifics that were incubated at warmer temperatures. Our findings suggest that cold nest temperatures are detrimental to S. virgatus, by delaying hatching of their eggs, reducing their hatching success, and by producing poorer quality offspring. These negative effects would likely provide a selective advantage for any mechanism through which these lizards could maintain warmer incubation temperatures in cold climates, including the evolution of prolonged egg retention and viviparity.

Below the thermal optimum, performance should be positively correlated with food-temperature covariance and the opposite is predicted above it. At lower temperatures, covariance should determine whether food and temperature variance increases or decreases performance compared to constant conditions.

It is thought that facilitation results from stress amelioration, but it is unclear which of the many stressors acting in these environments is ameliorated. We aimed at determining the relative importance of different stressors as drivers of facilitation by the tussock Festuca tolucensis in Mexico. We employed eight experimental treatments to manipulate five stressors in the field: minimum temperatures by using electric radiators that kept plants warm; maximum temperatures by means of reflective sand that precluded temperature build-up during the day; UV radiation by using screens opaque to UV; poor soil properties by comparing soils from beneath tussocks and from bare ground; and low water availability by adding vermiculite to the soil. The performance (survival and growth) of Mexerion sarmentosum (a plant usually associated with Festuca) in these treatments was compared to that recorded under tussocks and in bare ground. Amelioration of extreme temperatures had the largest positive effects on Mexerion survival. UV radiation and increased soil humidity did not affect survival, although humidity increased growth rates. Nevertheless, tussocks reduced the growth of Mexerion, which is consistent with observations of competition between plants and soil microorganisms favoured by tussocks.

Nocturnal warming increased leaf respiration of two dominant grass species by 36.3%, enhanced consumption of carbohydrates in the leaves (72.2% and 60.5% for sugar and starch, respectively), and consequently stimulated plant photosynthesis by 19.8% in the subsequent days. Our experimental findings confirm previous observations of nocturnal warming stimulating plant photosynthesis through increased draw-down of leaf carbohydrates at night. The enhancement of plant photosynthesis overcompensated the increased C loss via plant respiration under nocturnal warming and shifted the steppe ecosystem from a minor C source (1.87 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)) to a C sink (21.72 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)) across the three growing seasons from 2006 to 2008.

These results challenged the widespread notion that both elevated temperatures (e.g. 30 degrees C) and temperature fluctuations are required for digestion and growth in temperate climate reptiles. Here, we investigated the impact of constant cool temperatures on another physiological performance that is crucial to population persistence: gestation. At the time when reproductive females were midway through vitellogenesis, we placed ten reproductive and two non-reproductive female aspic vipers at each of two contrasted constant temperature conditions: cool (23 degrees C) versus warm (28 degrees C). Sixty percent of the females placed at 28 degrees C gave birth to healthy offspring, suggesting that constant warm body temperatures were compatible with normal offspring production. Conversely, none of the cool females gave birth to healthy offspring. A blister disease affected exclusively cool pregnant females. Apparently, the combination of cool temperatures plus gestation was too challenging for such females. Our results suggest that reproduction is more thermally sensitive than digestion or growth, indeed gestation faltered under moderately cool thermal constraints. This sensitivity could be a crucial factor determining the capacity of this species to colonize different habitats. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A comparison between elapid and viperid snakes in the field and in experimental conditions,ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER,,,,,,,,,,,,"Temperature profoundly influences the biology of ectotherm organisms, for example reptiles, which mostly regulate their body temperature behaviorally by shuttling between heat sources and sinks. The thermal quality of the environment directly affects the amount of time that a reptile takes to keep the body temperature within the optimal range. The foraging strategy of reptiles is often correlated to the thermoregulatory strategies. Depending on their foraging strategy, carnivorous reptiles can be high-energy consumers (active foragers) or low-energy consumers (ambush foragers). Our study allowed to get insights into basking versus non-basking behaviors of (i) snakes belonging to two different families (eight viperids and four elapids) with contrasted life-styles by either field or captive observations, (ii) free-ranging snakes (n = 3245) inhabiting contrasted habitats (forest versus savannah), and (iii) captive snakes (n = 4) outside the feeding activity and during digestion phase. We observed a tendency to spend more time in thermoregulation in the viperids than in the elapids and this pattern were consistent between field and experimental observations. We suggest that the higher basking activity of viperids is correlated to their predominantly nocturnal and ambush habits compared to the diurnal and active-foraging habits of the elapids. We also observed an effect of the thermal environmental quality with the savannah species tending to bask less than forest species. As for postprandial termophily, viperids showed a longer postprandial basking time than elapids even if all the snakes in the captivity sample were fed identically in terms of prey type and relative prey mass.

Banks grass mite development time in degree days, fecundity, and leaf area coverage were measured on sorghum lines previously classified as either preflowering drought-resistant, postflowering drought-resistant, overall drought-resistant, or drought-susceptible. Pre- and postflowering, drought-resistant lines were the most resistant to Banks grass mite population growth under dryland conditions with moderate postflowering drought stress. Banks grass mite development time depended on leaf temperature and was also different among lines, suggesting that leaf temperatures varied among lines. Likewise, fecundity was affected by temperature, but after the temperature differences were taken into account, fecundity was not significantly different among lines. Under dryland conditions with moderate postflowering drought stress, the leaf area covered by mite colonies was lower on pre- and postflowering, drought-resistant lines than on drought-susceptible lines but not different between overall drought-resistant lines and drought-susceptible lines. Under irrigated conditions, the leaf area covered by mite colonies was not different among lines. These results suggest that pre- and postflowering drought-resistant lines maintained relatively lower leaf temperatures in dryland plots but not irrigated plots during Banks grass mite colonization. Besides the leaf temperature effect, antibiosis also was associated with drought resistance. When leaf temperatures were similar, more degree days were needed for Banks grass mites to complete development on postflowering, drought-resistant lines than on drought-susceptible lines. However, leaf temperature appeared to be the most important factor affecting Banks grass mite developmental time and population growth. Host plant resistance based on leaf temperature may suppress spider mite outbreaks more effectively over time than host plant resistance based on plant-derived allelochemicals because of reduced selection pressure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0493,1938-291X,,,,DEC,1992,85,6,,,,,2170,2184,,10.1093/jee/85.6.2170,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/85.6.2170,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992KB23700021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using microbial experimental evolution, V. fischeri was selected to low (8 degrees C), high (34 degrees C), and fluctuating temperature stress (8 degrees C/34 degrees C) for 2000 generations.

V. fischeri demonstrated significant adaptation to low, high, and fluctuating temperature stress. V. fischeri did not display significant adaptation to the benign temperatures. Adaptation to stressful temperatures facilitated V. fischeri's ability to colonize the squid host relative to the ancestral lines. Bioluminescence levels also increased.

Bioenergetic costs of emersion are likely to vary based on an organism's vertical location in the intertidal. The present study quantified the metabolic costs of microhabitat choice in the important intertidal predator Pisaster ochraceus. Rates of oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured at a range of ecologically relevant temperatures in both water and air. In both media, rates increased with increasing temperature but, at any given temperature, aerial VO2 was approximately 50% that of aquatic VO2. These rates, along with biomimetic body temperature data from two field sites in Bodega Bay, California, were used to estimate the metabolism of sea stars at different vertical locations over a 10-day period in the summers of 2006, 2007, and 2010. Results suggest that vertical location would have a much smaller effect on sea star VO2 than would inter-annual temperature differences. The influence of higher body temperatures experienced by sea stars at low tide in the mid-high intertidal, as compared to the low intertidal, was almost negligible because aerial VO2 was lower than aquatic VO2. By contrast, the higher average water temperature experienced by sea stars in 2006 yielded a 50% higher metabolic cost relative to sea stars in 2007 and 2010. These results suggest that energetic demands of intertidal organisms can vary markedly according to global environmental fluctuations such as El Nino and Pacific Decadal Oscillations.

This hypothesis requires that (i) natural nests are poorly buffered thermally, such that ambient regimes affect temperatures inside the nest, and (ii) short-term thermal variations modify attributes of the offspring. Field data on natural nests of the sub-alpine skink Bassiana duperreyi confirm the existence of this first effect, and laboratory experiments substantiate the latter. Exposure to warmer-than-usual temperatures for 2 weeks during the 9- to 16-week incubation period doubled hatching success, and significantly modified hatchling phenotypes thatching dates, offspring size and locomotor performance). The proportion of development completed prior to this exposure influenced the degree of response. Exposure to a brief 'window' of higher-than-usual temperatures soon after oviposition had more effect on hatching time, egg survival and hatchling phenotypes than if the exposure occurred later in development.

R3bv2 is a quarantine pathogen in North America and Europe because of its potential to damage the potato industry in cooler climates. However, R3bv2 will not become established if it cannot survive temperate winters. Previous experiments showed that in water at 4 degrees C, R3bv2 does not survive as long as native U. S. strains, but R3bv2 remains viable longer than U. S. strains in potato tubers at 4 degrees C. To further investigate the effects of temperature on this high-concern pathogen, we assessed the ability of R3bv2 and a native U. S. strain to survive typical temperate winter temperature cycles of 2 days at 5 degrees C followed by 2 days at -10 degrees C. We measured pathogen survival in infected tomato and geranium plants, in infected potato tubers, and in sterile water. The population sizes of both strains declined rapidly under these conditions in all three plant hosts and in sterile water, and no culturable R. solanacearum cells were detected after five to seven temperature cycles in plant tissue. The fluctuations played a critical role in loss of bacterial viability, since at a constant temperature of -20 degrees C, both strains could survive in infected geranium tissue for at least 6 months. These results suggest that even when sheltered in infected plant tissue, R3bv2 is unlikely to survive the temperature fluctuations typical of a northern temperate winter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0099-2240,1098-5336,,,,NOV,2010,76,21,,,,,7061,7067,,10.1128/AEM.01580-10,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01580-10,,,,,,,,20851983,,,,,WOS:000283439800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, predicting the dynamics of future SSTs is of vital importance which can help identify these extreme events and alleviate the losses they cause. In this paper, a machine learning method combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep recurrent neural network model and the AdaBoost ensemble learning model (LSTM-AdaBoost) is proposed to predict the short and mid-term daily SST considering that LSTM is good at modelling long-term dependencies but suffers from overfitting, while AdaBoost has strong prediction capability and is not easily overfitted. By combining these two strong and heterogeneous models, the prediction errors related to variance may cancel out each other and the final results can be improved. In this method, the historical time-series satellite data of SST anomaly (SSTA) is used instead of SST itself considering that the fluctuations of SSTs are very small compared to their absolute magnitudes. The seasonality of the SSTA time series is first modelled using polynomial regression and then removed. Then, the deseasonalized time series are used to train the developed LSTM model and AdaBoost model independently. Daily SSTA predictions are made using these two models, and eventually, their predictions are combined as final predictions using the averaging strategy. A case study in the East China Sea that predicts the daily SSTA 10?days ahead shows that the proposed LSTM-AdaBoost combination model outperforms the LSTM and AdaBoost separately, as well as the optimized support vector regression (SVR) model, the optimized feedforward backpropagation neural network model (BPNN), and the stacking LSTM-AdaBoost model (S_LSTM-AdaBoost), when judged using multiple error statistics and from different perspectives.

In relation to thermal tolerance limits, the effects of elevated pCO(2) could be expected to be more pronounced at the upper limits of the thermal tolerance window. Our study focused on Crepidula fornicata, an invasive gastropod which colonized shallow waters around European coasts during the 20th century. We investigated the effects of 10 weeks' exposure to current (380 A mu atm) and elevated (550, 750, 1,000 A mu atm) pCO(2) on this engineer species using an acute temperature increase (1 A degrees C 12 h(-1)) as the test. Respiration rates were measured on both males (small individuals) and females (large individuals). Mortality increased suddenly from 34 A degrees C, particularly in females. Respiration rate in C. fornicata increased linearly with temperature between 18 and 34 A degrees C, but no differences were detected between the different pCO(2) conditions either in the regressions between respiration rate and temperature or in Q(10) values. In the same way, condition indices were similar in all the pCO(2) treatments at the end of the experiment, but decreased from the beginning of the experiment. This species was highly resistant to acute exposure to high temperature regardless of pCO(2) levels, even though food was limited during the experiment.

Thus, wildlife management agencies and sportsmen's organizations have invested substantial time and resources in the construction arid maintenance of water catchments. Although the availability of freestanding water sources is believed to influence many aspects of the ecology of desert bighorn sheep, the efficacy of these water sources has been questioned arid his not been examined experimentally. We used a before-after-control-impact study design to determine if removal of water catchments changed diet, characteristics of foraging areas used by female desert bighorn sheep, home-range size, movement rates, distance to catchments, adult mortality, productivity, or juvenile recruitment in 2 mountain ranges on the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona, USA. During pretreatment (2002-2003), we ensured that water catchments were available to desert bighorn sheep in both mountain ranges; during posttreatment (2004-2005), we drained all water catchments in the treatment range. We measured diet composition, characteristics of foraging areas, 50% and 95% kernel home ranges, movement rates, and distance to water catchments seasonally from 2002 to 2005. We also estimated adult survival, lamb:female, and yearling:female ratios from 2002 to 2005. We predicted that removal of water catchments would result in 1) increased use of foraging areas with more vegetation cover, more thermal cover, and higher succulent abundance; 2) increased consumption of cacti and other succulents; 3) an increase in home-range size, movement rates, and distance to nearest catchment; and 4) a decrease in adult survival, productivity, and juvenile recruitment. Removal of water catchments in the treatment range did not result in predicted changes in diet, foraging area selection, home-range size, movement rates, mortality, productivity, or recruitment. Female desert bighorn sheep did use areas with more thermal cover during the summer after removal of water catchments, but other characteristics of foraging areas used by bighorn sheep and their diet did not change appreciably with removal of water catchments. We did not document changes in home-range area, movement rates, or distance sheep were from water during hotter months; we only documented changes in home-range area, movement rates, and distance to water catchments during winter and autumn. There were 10 desert bighorn sheep mortalities in the treatment range and 8 in the control range; 7 mortalities in each mountain range were during pretreatment. Twelve of the 18 total mortalities occurred during summer. Survival rate was lower during pretreatment than posttreatment in both mountain ranges. We did not document increased mortality or a change in lamb:female or yearling:female ratios after removal of water catchments. Home-range area and movement rates declined with increasing precipitation. Annual Survival rites increased with increases in the current year's total precipitation and total precipitation during the previous year; annual survival rates declined with increases in average daily temperature during winter. There was a severe drought during pretreatment and abnormally wet conditions during posttreatment. The increase in precipitation that coincided with removal of water sources improved forage conditions during posttreatment arid many have provided adequate water for female desert bighorn shep. The lick of change in home-range size, movement rates, and distance to the nearest water catchment during hot, dry seasons after removal of water sources suggests that forage conditions played a greater role in determining home-range area arid movement rates than did the presence of water catchments. Higher mortality rates during the drought of the pretreatment period indicates that during droughts as severe as that of 2002, presence of water catchments was not sufficient to prevent mortalities of desert bighorn sheep and a lack of forage quality and quantity was likely the primary limiting factor of the population during this time. Improving forage conditions during posttreatment, increases in forage moisture content, and availability of naturally occurring sources of free water in the treatment range likely minimized any impact of removing water catchments on survival rates and lamb:female and yearling:female ratios. However, due to the climatic conditions during the study we were unable to assess how the treatment population would have responded to a lack of water sources during a drought period. The influence of anthropogenic water catchments, if any, Oil desert bighorn sheep populations may be strongest during years with weather conditions that are neither drought nor wet periods. Given the high interannual variability in precipitation in many areas of the and Southwest, it is important for wildlife managers to determine if and when water is the primary limiting factor for populations of desert bighorn sheep in order to make the most efficient use of agency time and resources.",,,,,,"Cain, James/0000-0003-4743-516X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0084-0173,1938-5455,,,,SEP,2008,,171,,,,,1,32,,10.2193/2007-209,http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2007-209,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000258931000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Incubation temperature affected the body size (linear length and mass) and shape of hatchlings, with eggs incubated at 26, 28, and 30 degrees C producing larger and heavier hatchlings than did those incubated at 24 degrees C, 32 degrees C, or fluctuating temperatures. Our results showed that exposure of P. chinensis eggs to extreme temperatures for brief periods of time did not increase embryonic mortality and, in the fluctuating-temperature treatment, the thermal variance affected hatchling morphology more evidently than the thermal mean. Our results highlight the importance of the thermal variance in affecting embryonic development and hatchling morphology, and add further evidence that temperatures within the range of 26-30 degrees C are optimal for P. chinensis embryos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2095-0357,,,,,,2017,8,4,,,,,262,268,,10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170029,http://dx.doi.org/10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.170029,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000419555800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The microtopographical differences in polygonal geomorphology produce heterogeneity in permafrost depth, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil geochemistry, and plant distribution. Few measurements have been made, however, of how water fluxes vary across polygonal tundra plant types, limiting our ability to understand and model these ecosystems. Our objective was to investigate how plant distribution and geomorphological location affect actual evapotranspiration (ET). These effects are especially critical in light of the rapid change polygonal tundra systems are experiencing with Arctic warming. At a field site near Barrow, Alaska, USA, we investigated the relationships between ET and plant cover in 2014 and 2015. ET was measured at a range of spatial and temporal scales using: (1) An eddy covariance flux tower for continuous landscape-scale monitoring; (2) An automated clear surface chamber over dry vegetation in a fixed location for continuous plot-scale monitoring; and (3) Manual measurements with a clear portable chamber in approximately 60 locations across the landscape. We found that variation in environmental conditions and plant community composition, driven by microtopographical features, has significant influence on ET. Among plant types, ET from moss-covered and inundated areas was more than twice that from other plant types. ET from troughs and low polygonal centers was significantly higher than from high polygonal centers. ET varied seasonally, with peak fluxes of 0.14 mm h(-1) in July. Despite 24 hours of daylight in summer, diurnal fluctuations in incoming solar radiation and plant processes produced a diurnal cycle in ET. Combining the patterns we observed with projections for the impact of permafrost degradation on polygonal structure suggests that microtopographic changes associated with permafrost thaw have the potential to alter tundra ecosystem ET.

Consequently it is difficult to estimate the regional distribution of CH4 emissions in space and time from rice fields across China. Two water treatments (controlled irrigation (CI), a routine WSI practice in China, and a traditional continuous flooded irrigation (CI)) were used to examine diurnal and seasonal variations of CH4 emissions in field experiments in Kunshan, east China. The heavy barns in the site have organic matter content of 30.3 g/kg while percolation rates in the shallow groundwater range from 2 to 10 mm per day. Gas samples were collected and analyzed using a static chamber technique and a Gas Chromatograph system respectively. The results show that under WSI conditions, the diurnal variation of CH4 emissions presented regular afternoon-maximum mode during the initial and middle tillering stage, which mainly depends on air temperature. Only one peak of CH4 emission occurred in tillering growth stage of rice season under CI conditions, which is mainly regulated by drainage or water layer receding. For CI, seasonal CH4 emission is 2.4 g.m(-2)similar to 24.5g.m(-2), and the seasonal average flux is 0.8 mg.m(-2).h(-1)similar to 8.15 mg.m(-2).h(-1), which is 39-85% lower than that for FI.

When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability (> 20 degrees C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24 C) or fluctuating temperatures (18-32 degrees C) under high or low UV-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment.",,,,,"Cramp, Rebecca L/A-4488-2010; Kern, Pippa/AAU-5236-2020; Franklin, Craig/G-7343-2012","Cramp, Rebecca L/0000-0001-9798-2271; Kern, Pippa/0000-0001-8658-2811; Franklin, Craig/0000-0003-1315-3797",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,APR,2014,217,8,,,,,1246,1252,,10.1242/jeb.097006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.097006,,,,,,,,24363412,,,,,WOS:000334673700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

In boreal coastal environments, temperature and pH vary greatly seasonally, but sometimes also rapidly within hours due to upwelling events. We studied if copepod zooplankton living in a fluctuating environment are tolerant to climate change effects predicted for 2100, i.e., a temperature increase of 3 degrees C and a pH decrease of 0.4. Egg production of the copepod Acartia sp. was followed over five consecutive days at four temperature and pH conditions (17 degrees C/ambient pH; 17 degrees C/low pH; 20 degrees C/ambient pH; 20 degrees C/low pH). Egg production was higher in treatments with warmer temperature but the increase was smaller when copepods were simultaneously exposed to warmer temperature and lowered pH. To reveal if maternal effects are important in terms of adaptation to a changing environment, we conducted an egg transplantation experiment, where the produced eggs were moved to a different environment and egg hatching was monitored for three days. When pH changed between the egg production and hatching conditions, it resulted in lower hatching success, but the effect was diminished over the course of the experiment possibly due to improved maternal provisioning. Warmer egg production temperature induced a positive maternal effect and increased the egg hatching rate. Warmer hatching temperature resulted also in earlier hatching. However, the temperature effects appear to be dependent on the ambient sea temperature.

A Weibull function was fitted to the data points, describing maximum survival time as a function of temperature. In another experiment at -6 degrees C, the progress of mortality increasing with exposure time was identified. These values were fitted by a sigmoidal function converging asymptotically to 100% mortality for very long exposure times. Analysing mortality data from the maximum survival experiment by a generalized linear model showed a significant common slope parameter (p <.001) that reveals parallelism of the survival curves at each temperature if a log time axis is used. These curves appear stretched (time scaled) if plotted with a nonlogarithmic time axis. By combining these mathematical relations, it was possible to calculate a speciesspecific `mortality surface' which exhibits mortalities, depending on temperature and duration of exposure. In order to accumulate hourly mortalities for courses of varying temperatures, an algorithm was developed which yields mortality values from that surface taking into account the attained mortality level. In validation experiments, recorded mortalities were compared against modelled mortalities. Prediction of mortality was partially supported by the model, but pupae experiencing intensely fluctuating temperatures showed decreased mortality, probably caused by rapid cold hardening during exposure. Despite this observation, mortality data converged to distinct levels very close to 100% depending on the intensity of temperature fluctuations that were characteristic for different types of experiments. The highest mortality limit occurred at intensely fluctuating temperatures in laboratory experiments. This constituted a benchmark that was not reached under various field conditions. Thus, it was possible to identify temperature limits for the extinction of field populations of Tuta absoluta pupae.",,,,,,"Reinbacher, Lara/0000-0003-1436-115X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0931-2048,1439-0418,,,,DEC,2019,143,10,,,,,1143,1153,,10.1111/jen.12693,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.12693,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000862588000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Samples from 0.5 and 5 m showed a similar peroxidation pattern, which was maximal after the fall off in algal biomass. The rapid decline in Peridinium biomass coincided with ambient lake temperatures of 21-23 degrees C. Fatty acid composition profiles were similar at both depths, although after the peak of the bloom, a significant increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids and oleic acid was only found at 0.5 m, together with a decrease in the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These effects were related to ambient light stress rather than a result of lipid peroxidation. Lake samples taken at different periods of the bloom and incubated at various temperatures showed differential peroxidation. Higher temperatures caused increased lipid peroxidation, but this appeared to be dependent on the sampling period. Samples withdrawn from the lake at the beginning of the bloom showed little peroxidation after a 5 day incubation at 14 degrees C, room temperature (25 degrees C) or ambient lake temperature (16 degrees C) compared to mid-bloom samples in which there was a significant increase in peroxidation when they were incubated at room temperature (25 degrees C) or ambient lake temperature (22 degrees C). Incubation at 14 degrees C inhibited peroxidation; however, samples from mid-bloom again showed enhanced peroxidation compared with those from the beginning of the bloom. These in situ results suggested a relationship between temperature, another environmental variable during the bloom and lipid peroxidation in Peridinium. As total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIG) concentrations fall significantly during the progress of the bloom and represent an important source of environmental stress, laboratory experiments were established to investigate the synergistic effect of temperature and carbon nutrition on lipid peroxidation in Peridinium cultures. Increased temperature alone caused a slight increase in lipid peroxidation, but this was greatly augmented by carbon limitation. Although carbon limitation induced increased catalase activity, at higher temperatures activity declined after 48 h, allowing for the substantial increase in lipid peroxidation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0142-7873,1464-3774,,,,FEB,1998,20,2,,,,,355,369,,10.1093/plankt/20.2.355,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/20.2.355,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000072676300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Phenotypic plasticity offers a particularly powerful mechanism to cope with short-time temperature fluctuations. While temperature-induced plasticity in thermal tolerance has been widely explored, effects of other environmental factors have received much less attention. Using a full-factorial design we here show that variation in temperature stress resistance can be triggered by photoperiod (and temperature) in the fly Protophormia terraenovae, with shorter day lengths inducing more cold- and longer day lengths more heat-tolerant phenotypes. Such plastic changes were not related to different developmental pathways (reproductive activity or reproductive diapause), and can be induced during development but also in the adult stage (at least for cold tolerance). We suggest that short-term, photoperiod-mediated changes in insect thermal tolerance represent a mechanism of adaptive seasonal plasticity.

Recommendations for water requirements are usually reported on a flock basis without considering individual variation. In the present study, a total of 18 turkeys were used to measure water intake over a 1-wk period starting at 15 wk of age by applying the deuterium dilution technique. Poults originated from eggs exposed to different incubation treatments, with eggs incubated at normal temperature (37.5 degrees C) and eggs subjected to 38.5 degrees C at embryonic d 9 to 12. Experimental birds were kept in flocks of 22 to 30 birds separated by sex and treatment. Feed and water were provided ad libitum. Incubation treatment had no significant effect on any of the parameters investigated (BW, daily gain, water turnover rate, total body water, TWI), whereas sex exerted a significant effect on nearly all traits. Total body water ranged between 60 and 65% of BW, with significantly (P < 0.05) greater values for toms (63.2%) than for hens (60.9%). Males had approximately 30% greater water influxes than females (1,054 +/- 198 vs. 742 +/- 153 mL/d, mean +/- SD). However, the significant influence of sex was eliminated (P = 0.464) when TWI was expressed as grams per kilogram of BW (76 +/- 18 vs. 70 +/- 12 mL/kg of BW; males vs. females). Water consumed averaged 837 mL in male and 569 mL per day in female birds.

We test the hypothesis that the timing of spatial variation relative to diel temperature cycles can meaningfully alter movement patterns and population dynamics, using the motile green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our results indicate that C. reinhardtii individuals growing in environments with positive relationships between spatial variability and mean temperature show reduced population growth rates, more directed movement as indicated by a reduced turning angle, and decreased negative thermotaxis over time, relative to those growing in environments with a negative relationship between spatial variability and mean temperature.

Temperatures are increasing globally, but this increase is not symmetrical; instead, night-time minimum air temperatures increase faster than daytime maximum temperatures. However, we still know little about when and how this differential increase in maximum versus minimum air temperatures affects ecological interactions between species. Understanding the connection between different types (night vs. day) of warming and interspecific interactions is essential to predict the ecological consequences of climate change for natural ecosystems. 2. Here we used experiments in a common predator (lady beetle)-prey (aphid) system to examine how night warming, thermal regime (constant vs. fluctuating) and prey density influence demographic rates and per capita feeding rate and thus predation pressure. We mainly focused on the demographic variables and prey consumption as well as energy-related variables of the predators to understand how changes in night-time temperature, temperature regime and prey density affect predator performances and to differentiate these effects between constant and fluctuating thermal conditions. 3. We found that warming effects on most of the individual demographic rates and per capita consumption rates of the predator differed between constant and fluctuating regimes. These differences scaled up to alter population stage structure and population growth rate of the predator and ultimately the predation pressure in our system. Furthermore, warming had stronger and negative consequences on predator population growth and thus predation pressure in constant regime, but little or even positive effects under fluctuating conditions. Importantly, these results are consistent across prey densities. 4. Our results suggest that compared to night warming, predictions based on mean warming can under- or overestimate species demographic rates and per capita predation effects, causing inaccurate or even misleading expectations on population structure, long-term population growth and interspecific interactions. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for both ecologically relevant diurnal temperature cycle and lifelong demographics and per capita consumption when assessing how warming affects interspecific interactions. Our findings thus provide better understanding of how night warming will affect predator-prey interactions and energy flux within trophic cascades and also have implications for predicting the consequences of top-down control in natural and agricultural ecosystems under climate change.",,,,,"Ma, Chun-Sen/K-5414-2019; Rudolf, Volker/B-7913-2009","Ma, Chun-Sen/0000-0002-3253-6921; Ma, Gang/0000-0002-3378-9488; Rudolf, Volker/0000-0002-9214-2000",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,SEP,2021,35,9,,,,,2094,2107,,10.1111/1365-2435.13833,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13833,,JUN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000657152800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A Weibull function was fitted to the data points, describing maximum survival time as a function of temperature. In another experiment at -6 degrees C, the progress of mortality increasing with exposure time was identified. These values were fitted by a sigmoidal function converging asymptotically to 100% mortality for very long exposure times. Analysing mortality data from the maximum survival experiment by a generalized linear model showed a significant common slope parameter (p < .001) that reveals parallelism of the survival curves at each temperature if a log time axis is used. These curves appear stretched (time scaled) if plotted with a nonlogarithmic time axis. By combining these mathematical relations, it was possible to calculate a species-specific 'mortality surface' which exhibits mortalities, depending on temperature and duration of exposure. In order to accumulate hourly mortalities for courses of varying temperatures, an algorithm was developed which yields mortality values from that surface taking into account the attained mortality level. In validation experiments, recorded mortalities were compared against modelled mortalities. Prediction of mortality was partially supported by the model, but pupae experiencing intensely fluctuating temperatures showed decreased mortality, probably caused by rapid cold hardening during exposure. Despite this observation, mortality data converged to distinct levels very close to 100% depending on the intensity of temperature fluctuations that were characteristic for different types of experiments. The highest mortality limit occurred at intensely fluctuating temperatures in laboratory experiments. This constituted a benchmark that was not reached under various field conditions. Thus, it was possible to identify temperature limits for the extinction of field populations of Tuta absoluta pupae.",,,,,,"Reinbacher, Lara/0000-0003-1436-115X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0931-2048,1439-0418,,,,OCT,2019,143,10,,,,,1143,1153,,10.1111/jen.12693,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.12693,,SEP 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000487531700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Herein, we used mark-release-recapture (MRR) to derive seasonal abundance estimates of Aedes albopictus population sizes within a delimited geographical area in Reunion Island. Population size of Ae. albopictus was estimated through four mark-release-recapture experiments carried out separately in different seasons. Marked males and females were released each time, and recaptured using BG sentinel traps for six consecutive days. Data were used to estimate the population size using a conceptual model that incorporates the variation in daily mortality rates. The likely influence of environmental factors on the magnitude of catches and on population fluctuation was analyzed. A total of 2827 mosquitoes (1914 males and 913 females) were marked and released on four occasions during dry and wet seasons. After release, 138 males (7.21%) and 86 females (9.41%) of the marked specimens were recaptured in subsequent samplings. The effectiveness of the daily captures of wild and released mosquitoes was significantly influenced by meteorological conditions such as temperature, rainfall, wind speed and light intensity. The estimates of Ae. albopictus population size obtained with our model estimator ranged from 298 to 1238 males and 604 to 2208 females per ha, with seasonal variability - higher population size in the humid season.

The federally listed threatened Bliss Rapids snail, Taylorconcha serpenticola Hershler et al., 1994 (Family: Hydrobiidae), survives in and near these fluctuation zones. Remaining T. serpenticola populations occur only in sections of the Snake River that are impacted by these hydroelectric facilities and associated springs. Because effects of rapid draw-down in fluctuation zones on T. serpenticola are unknown, we conducted a laboratory experiment to evaluate potential impacts of desiccation. Our experiment compared desiccation resistance at several air temperatures, on dry and wetted substrates, and for 'small' vs. 'large' snails. Probit regression-maximum likelihood models estimated lethal time (LT50) values. Survival was significantly greater on wetted substrate than on dry substrate and was lowest at temperatures <0 degrees C and at 37 degrees C on dry substrate. Survival was greatest at 17 degrees C on wetted substrate. There was no significant difference in survival at temperatures above 0 degrees C on dry substrate other than at 37 degrees C. LT50 survival ranged from 0.5 hours at -7 degrees C to 157.0 hours at 17 degrees C on wetted substrate. There were no significant differences in survival relative to snail size in any treatment. Our results suggest that desiccation could impact T. serpenticola populations if snails become stranded on dry substrates during rapid water-level fluctuations of the Snake River, particularly during subzero winter or extreme high summer temperatures. The most important factor determining survival would be the ability to find refuge on the undersides of cobbles, where snails typically occur, or in habitats that remained moist for the duration of the draw-down of the river.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0740-2783,2162-2698,,,,MAR 21,2008,24,1-2,,,,,91,96,,10.4003/0740-2783-24.1.91,http://dx.doi.org/10.4003/0740-2783-24.1.91,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000254870200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Following initial desiccation, a strong CO2 pulse was measured within two hours of rewetting and a return to equilibrium conditions obtained within 168 hours, with the magnitude of the initial pulse varying by soil temperature and moisture addition. At equilibrium conditions, no correlation was found between CO2 flux and temperature across all moisture levels, although a weak positive correlation (r(2) = 0.1 to 0.2) was seen at moderate to high moisture levels. A much stronger correlation (r(2) > 0.4) was found between CO2 flux and soil moisture across the full range of temperatures and at both low and high temperatures.

Special emphasis was laid on the effect of fluctuating temperatures and on intraspecific differences between populations from two different field sites in the Swiss prealps (i.e. River Necker and River Thur). 2. Dinocras cephalotes embryos develop between 6.3 and 26.6 degrees C. The lower threshold temperature is lower than has been reported for more northern populations (i.e. from England and Norway), indicating the existence of a latitudinal gradient. Perla grandis eggs only developed between 9.9 and 18.4 degrees C. In P. marginata, successful embryogenesis was observed between 9.9 and 18.4 degrees C, but not enough eggs were available to explore the threshold temperatures. 3. Embryogenesis of D. cephalotes and P. grandis was significantly faster at a 12/16 degrees C daily fluctuating temperature regime than at a constant 14 degrees C. However, no significant difference was found between the development under simulated field temperature regimes (with less distinct daily amplitudes) and constant temperatures. 4. D. cephalotes, hatching of eggs from the Necker population was much less synchronous than that in the Thur population. Since the Necker discharge regime is harsher than the Thur regime, it is possible that this asynchrony spreads the risk of destruction during bed-moving floods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,DEC,1996,36,3,,,,,497,508,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00100.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00100.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996WA16200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The thermal environment affected size and several morphometric characteristics of hatchling lizards. Hatchlings from eggs incubated at 32 degrees C were smaller (snout-vent length, SVL) than those from 26 and 29 degrees C and had smaller mass residuals (from the regression on SVL) as well as shorter tail, head, and femur relative to SVL. Variation in the level of fluctuating asymmetry in meristic and morphometric traits associated with incubation temperatures was quite high but not clearly consistent with the prediction that environmental stress associated with the highest incubation temperatures might produce the highest level of asymmetry. When tested for locomotor capacity in trials developed at body temperatures of 32 and 35 degrees C, hatchlings from the 32 degrees C incubation treatment exhibited the worst performance in any aspect considered (burst speed, maximal length, and number of stops in the complete run). Repeated measures ANCOVAs (with initial egg mass as covariate) of snout-vent length and mass of lizards at days 0 and 20 revealed significant effects of incubation temperature only for mass, being again the hatchlings from eggs incubated at 32 degrees C those exhibiting the smallest final size. All together, our results evidenced a pervasive effect of thermal regime during incubation (and hence of nest site selection) on hatchling phenotypes. However, incubation temperature does not affect hatchling phenotypes in a continuous way; for most of the analysed traits a critical threshold seems to exist between 29 and 32 degrees C, so that hatchlings incubated at 32 degrees C exhibited major detrimental effects.

Understanding insects' thermal biology is therefore integral to population forecasting and pest management decision-making such as when to utilise crop spraying or biological control. Aphids are important crop pests in temperate regions, causing considerable yield losses. The aphid thermal-biology literature is, however, heavily biased towards the effects of rising mean temperatures, whereas the effects of fluctuating, extreme climatic events (e.g., heat waves and sub-zero cold periods) are largely overlooked. This study assessed the effects of laboratory-simulated heat waves and sub-zero cold periods on the survival, development period, and fecundity of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae: Microsiphini), in addition to assessing maternal effects on the birth weight and development period of the offspring of exposed individuals. Exposure to heat stress periods (total of 16h at 30 degrees C) significantly reduced aphid fecundity and increased physiological development period (in day-degrees) resulting in a reduced population growth rate. Cold exposure (total of 1.33h at -15 degrees C) reduced population growth rate due to an elongated development period (in days), but did not affect fecundity or physiological development period (in day-degrees). Both cold and heat stress significantly reduced aphid survival. Maternal experience of heat stress reduced nymphal birth weight although nymphal development period was not affected by either cold or heat stress. The results suggest that including the effects of fluctuating, extreme temperature events on aphid life history in population forecast models is likely to be of great importance to pest management decision-making. The demonstration of maternal effects on birth weight also suggests that cross-generational effects of heat waves on population growth rates could occur.",,,,,"Leather, Simon R/H-7921-2019","Leather, Simon R/0000-0003-3007-8514",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,1570-7458,,,,MAR,2014,150,3,,,,,240,249,,10.1111/eea.12160,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.12160,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000330907500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the other hand, much less is known about how fire affects the thermal properties and the long-term thermal regime of soils. Such knowledge is important for understanding the nature of the soil's post-fire recovery because plant roots and soil microbes will have to adapt to any changes in the day-to-day thermal regime. This study, which was carried out at Manitou Experimental Forest (a semiarid site in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado, USA), examines three aspects of how fire can affect the long-term (post-fire) thermal energy flow in soils. First, observational evidence is presented that prescribed burns can alter the thermal conductivity of soils to a depth of at least 0.2m without altering its bulk density. Second, data are presented on the thermal properties of ash. (Such data are necessary for understanding and modeling the impact any remaining post-fire ash layer might have on the daily and seasonal flow of thermal energy through the soil.) Third, observational data are presented on the long-term effects that prescribed burns can have on soil surface temperatures. In an effort to quantify long-term changes in the soil temperatures and heat fluxes resulting from fire this study concludes by developing and using an analytical model of the daily and annual cycles of soil heating and cooling, which incorporates observed ( linear variation of) vertical structure of the soil thermal properties and observed changes in the surface temperatures, to synthesise these fire-induced effects. Modeling results suggest that under the dry soil conditions, typical of the experimental forest, the amplitudes of the daily and seasonal cycles of soil heating/cooling in the fire-affected soils will greatly exceed those in the soils unaffected by fire for several months to years following the fire and that these effects propagate to depths exceeding one metre.",,,,,"Frank, John/ABD-2324-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1049-8001,1448-5516,,,,,2008,17,1,,,,,131,146,,10.1071/WF06118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF06118,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000253219200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, studies on the effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations on organisms, especially the effects on specific life stages, are still limited. We examined the immediate effects of the same average temperature (25 degrees C) and different temperature amplitudes (+/- 4, +/- 6, +/- 8, +/- 10, +/- 12 degrees C) on the development and survival of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). We also assessed carry-over effects on adult longevity, reproduction, development, and survival of offspring across generations. The effect of moderate temperature amplitudes was similar to that of constant temperature. Wide temperature amplitudes inhibited the development of pupae, reduced total reproduction, lowered intrinsic rates of population growth, and slowed the development and survival of eggs on the first day, but the proportion of females ovipositing on the first three days increased. Insects coped with the adverse effects of wide temperature amplitudes by laying eggs as soon as possible. Our results confirmed that a logistic model based on daily average temperature cannot predict development rates under wide temperature amplitudes. These findings highlight the effect of environmental temperature fluctuations at the pupal stage on the development and oviposition patterns of P. xylostella and should be fully considered when predicting field occurrence.",,,,,,"Zhao, Fei/0000-0003-4158-3604",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,AUG,2021,50,4,,,,,888,897,,10.1093/ee/nvab044,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvab044,,MAY 2021,,,,,,33974683,,,,,WOS:000709908300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The egg density-weighted mean environmental temperature until day 30 of the experiment was 20-24 degrees C for the anchovy and 17-20 degrees C for the sardine, which can be explained by spawning areas and seasons, and interannual oceanic variability. Regression analyses revealed that the contribution of environmental temperature to the logarithm of recruitment per spawning (expected to have a negative relationship with the mean mortality coefficient) was significant for both the anchovy and sardine, especially until day 30, which can be regarded as the initial stages of their life cycles. The relationship was quadratic for the anchovy, with an optimal temperature of 21-22 degrees C, and linear for the sardine, with a negative coefficient.

The Logan model was particularly successful at estimating seed germination rates at sub-optimal temperatures (5-25 degrees C) that occur under field conditions and at temperatures near the base and maximum germination temperatures. Based on the Logan Type III model, a computer simulation was developed using Time Varying Distributed Delays as implemented in the USDA-ARS Hermes (Hierarchical Environment for Research Modeling of Ecological Systems) simulation modeling system, tested across fluctuating temperatures in the laboratory, and applied to predict seed germination of Z. palustris under actual field conditions over an entire year in differing sections of the Fall River.

Majority of the studies reporting shifts in plant phenology are available from the North America and Europe and largely scarce from the developing world, including the Himalaya; and studies integrating multiple methodological approaches to investigate the climate-driven phenological shifts are too rare. Here, we report the shifts in spring flowering phenology of model plant species, Sternbergia vernalis in response to the changing climate in Kashmir Himalaya, by integrating decadal field observational records with long-term herbarium and dated-photograph data, and supported with experimental evidences. Our results revealed a significant increasing trend of 0.038, 0.016 and 0.023 degrees C/year in the annual mean maximum temperature (Tmax), mean minimum temperature (Tmin) and diurnal temperature range (DTR) respectively; but an insignificant decreasing trend in annual precipitation of -1.24 mm/year over the last four decades (1980-2019) in this Himalayan region. The flowering phenology of S. vernalis has significantly advanced by 11.8 days/degrees C and 27.8 days/degrees C increase in Tmax and Tmin respectively, indicating that the climate warming has led to substantial shifts in flowering phenology of the model plant species. We also observed a strong association of seasonal Tmax (December-February) and DTR on the early onset of spring flowering, however precipitation had no significant effect on the timing of flowering. The greenhouse experiment results further supported a significant effect of temperature in triggering the phenological shifts, wherein the model plant grown under different temperature treatments flowered 9-20 days earlier compared to the control. Our study showcases the integrated use of multiple methodological approaches for unravelling the long-term phenological shifts in response to climate change, and contributes in filling the knowledge gaps in the phenological research from the developing world in general and the Himalaya in particular.

Laboratory experiments carried out 50 years ago provide extensive measures of temperature-dependent rates of development, fat consumption and mortality in tsetse pupae. We improve on the models originally fitted to these data, providing better parameter estimates for use in population modelling. A composite function accurately models rates of pupal development for T = 8-32 degrees C. Pupal duration can be estimated by summing the temperature-dependent daily percentage of development completed. Fat consumption is modelled as a logistic function of temperature; the total fat consumed during pupal development takes a minimum for T approximate to 25 degrees C. Pupae experiencing constant temperatures <16 degrees C exhaust their fat reserves before they complete development. At high temperatures, direct effects kill the pupae before fat stores are exhausted. The relationship between pupal mortality and temperature is well described by the sum of two exponential functions. Summing daily mortality rates over the whole pupal period does not reliably predict overall mortality. Mortality is more strongly correlated with the mean temperature experienced over pupal life or, for T <= 30 degrees C, the fat consumption during this period. The new results will be particularly useful in the construction of various models for tsetse population dynamics, and will have particular relevance for agent-based models where the lives of individual tsetse are simulated using a daily time step.",,,,,,"Hargrove, John/0000-0003-0346-5260",,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-4853,1475-2670,,,,FEB,2020,110,1,,,,,44,56,PII S0007485319000233,10.1017/S0007485319000233,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485319000233,,,,,,,,31190649,,,,,WOS:000505825100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The final size and shell density of inshore reef foraminifera were unaffected by elevated temperature, and the enzyme activity in these individuals showed that they were able to acclimate to new temperature conditions. In contrast, offshore A. lobifera were more sensitive to changes in temperature, and heat stress caused growth impairment and inhibited Mg-ATPase activity. However, newly added chambers were not affected. These results suggested that Mg-ATPase plays an important role in regulating intracellular Mg2+ ions, but has little influence in the onset of calcification in A. lobifera.

To date, most multi-pool SOC models assume a general Q(10) of 2 despite experimental evidence suggesting different Q(10) for different carbon fractions. The aim of this study was to test if the use of experimentally derived pool specific Q(10) values improves the performance of SOC models. Five contrasting data sets from three field experiments and two laboratory incubations were used to study the link between carbon pool recalcitrance and Q(10) using two different approaches: a) Bayesian calibration of the Daisy SOC model parameters to infer Q(10) of SOC and crop-litter pools, and b) using measured Q(10) values of carbon degrading enzymes as proxies for Q(10) of different Daisy pools. Namely beta-glucosidase (median Q(10) of 1.82) was assigned to metabolic litter and phenol/peroxidase (1.35) to structural litter and both SOC pools. To partition litter-carbon and SOC into model pools, the lignin-to-nitrogen ratio and the ratio of aliphatic/aromatic-carboxylate carbon were used, respectively. Measurements included soil microbial biomass, soil carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution and remaining carbon in soils and crop-litter. In the Bayesian calibration, strong differences in inferred Q(10) values of the same pools between experiments suggested that intrinsic substrate recalcitrance was not the main driver of temperature sensitivity. For field experiment simulations, both the Q(10) values derived by Bayesian calibration and measured enzyme Q(10) were centered around values below 2, contrasting with high Q(10) values for mineralization under laboratory incubations (close to 3). Furthermore, assigning measured phenol/peroxidase Q(10) values to the slow crop-litter as well as both SOC pools and (beta-glucosidase to the fast crop-litter pool (approach b), could significantly improve model performance compared to using the default Q(10) value of 2 for all pools. Root-mean-squared-deviation reductions were between 3 and 10% for field experiments, with no change in the laboratory experiments. Thus, site specific Q(10) values of soil enzymes show potential as proxies for pool specific Q(10). We present a new conceptual framework to explain the observed differences in temperature sensitivities between experiments as a result of two fundamental driving factors classified in a) state variables, that fluctuate in time, and b) soil properties, that are constant over decades.

We conducted a common garden experiment using isolates of the fungal pathogen Rhynchosporium commune from nine barley populations representing climatically diverse locations. Clonal replicates of 126 genetically distinct isolates were assessed for their growth rate at 12 degrees C, 18 degrees C, and 22 degrees C. Populations originating from climates with higher monthly temperature variation had higher growth rate at all three temperatures compared with populations from climates with less temperature fluctuation. Population differentiation in growth rate (QST) was significantly higher at 22 degrees C than population differentiation for neutral microsatellite loci (GST), consistent with local adaptation for growth at higher temperatures. At 18 degrees C, we found evidence for stabilizing selection for growth rate as QST was significantly lower than GST. Heritability of growth rate under the three temperatures was substantial in all populations (0.580.76). Genetic variation was lower in populations with higher growth rate at the three temperatures and evolvability increased under heat stress in seven of nine populations. Our findings imply that the distribution of this pathogen is unlikely to be genetically limited under climate warming, due to its high genetic variation and plasticity for thermal tolerance.",,,,,"McDonald, Bruce A/A-2748-2008","McDonald, Bruce A/0000-0002-5332-2172",,,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,APR,2013,6,3,,,,,524,534,,10.1111/eva.12039,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.12039,,,,,,,,23745143,,,,,WOS:000316957800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate models project decreases in the amount of snowfall received throughout the temperate-boreal region by 2100, as average wintertime temperatures increase. We used a paired-plot experimental design to assess the effect of snow removal on soil temperature and frost development at six forested peatland sites in northern Minnesota, USA, during the three winters from 2017 to 2020. Treatments consisted of 1) removal of snow throughout the winter, or 2) ambient snow cover conditions. During the three years of the study, there was a significant effect of snow removal by mid-winter that continued into late winter and spring, where removal of snow increased soil frost depth compared to plots with ambient snow cover treatment. Soil temperatures in the removal plots were highly responsive to air temperature fluctuations to depths of 20 cm or more, whereas the ambient snow cover soils exhibited little fluctuation and degrees maintained temperatures near or above 0 C for much of the winter season. We found that each cumulative freezing degree day resulted in an average of 0.36 cm of soil frost development in snow removal plots, as compared to 0.07 cm depth in the ambient treatment plots. Soils were significantly colder through much of the summer growing season in the removal treatment compared to the ambient treatment, with detectable soil frost in the soil profile as late as mid- to late-June. These results indicate that predicted changes in wintertime precipitation may result in increased development of soil frost in forested peatland systems, although some of this effect may be offset by predicted concurrent increases in air temperature. We did not measure indicators of biological activity, but the large and prolonged reduction in soil temperature with snow removal is likely to depress biological activity throughout the growing season and the many ecosystem functions it influences. Because of the role that soil temperature and frost play on the hydrologic and ecological processes of peatlands, as well as the crucial role of soil frost in peatland forest management, findings of this study provide important insight into the potential effects of altered winter conditions on these expansive and ecologically important ecosystems.",,,,,,"Friesen, Hannah/0000-0003-4245-2294; Karwan, Diana/0000-0002-4529-0369",,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-7061,1872-6259,,,,JUL 15,2021,394,,,,,,,,115015,10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115015,,MAR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000641587900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Long-term exposure to low temperatures, commonly referred to as chilling, can lead to physiological effects collectively known as chill injury. Periodically increasing temperatures during long-term chilling has been shown to increase survival in many insects. However, the transcripts responsible for this increase in survival have never been characterized. Here, we present the first transcriptome-level analysis of increased longevity under fluctuating temperatures during chilling. Overwintering post-diapause quiescent alfalfa leafcutting bees (Megachile rotundata) were exposed to a constant temperature of 6 degrees C, or 6 degrees C with a daily fluctuation to 20 degrees C. RNA was collected at two different time points, before and after mortality rates began to diverge between temperature treatments. Expression analysis identified differentially regulated transcripts between pairwise comparisons of both treatments and time points. Transcripts functioning in ion homeostasis, metabolic pathways and oxidative stress response were up-regulated in individuals exposed to periodic temperature fluctuations during chilling. The differential expression of these transcripts provides support for the hypotheses that fluctuating temperatures protect against chill injury by reducing oxidative stress and returning ion concentrations and metabolic function to more favorable levels. Additionally, exposure to fluctuating temperatures leads to increased expression of transcripts functioning in the immune response and neurogenesis, providing evidence for additional mechanisms associated with increased survival during chilling in M. rotundata.",,,,,"Torson, Alex/AAV-5215-2020","Bowsher, Julia/0000-0001-6347-9635; Torson, Alex/0000-0002-5142-6162",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,APR,2015,218,7,,,,,1060,1068,,10.1242/jeb.113829,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.113829,,,,,,,,25657206,,,,,WOS:000354113300021,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, current remote sensing-based ET models can generally only provide snapshots of ET at the time of a satellite overpass and do not satisfy the expectations of hydrologists, irrigation engineers, or water resource managers concerned with practical applications. Four commonly used ET upscaling schemes, namely, the constant reference evaporative fraction (EFr) method, the constant evaporative fraction (EF) method, the constant extraterrestrial solar radiation ratio (R-p) method, and the constant observed global solar radiation ratio (R-g) method, were evaluated in this study using ground-based eddy covariance (EC) measurements and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived estimates from a two-source energy balance model. Analysis was made of both closed and un-closed surface fluxes and of different assumed satellite overpass times from mid-morning to mid-afternoon. Data for the analysis were collected at the Yucheng comprehensive experimental station in Northern China, spanning the period from late April 2009 to late October 2011. The results show that all four upscaling factors from noon to mid-afternoon had a better agreement with their corresponding daily averages. Overall, the EFr (R-g) method had the best (second best) performance of the four upscaling methods. The EF method was found to significantly underestimate the daily latent heat flux (LE) and performed the worst of the four upscaling methods. With the correction of the energy imbalance of EC measurements, the R-g method's performance was improved and outperformed the EF, method in the morning. The presence of clouds either increased or decreased the BIAS but generally increased the root mean square error (RMSE) for all four upscaling methods. When the upscaling methods were applied to convert the instantaneous MODIS remote sensing estimates of ET to daily values, the accuracy of the extrapolated daily ET was controlled by the accuracy of both the remote sensing ET estimates and the upscaling methods themselves. With the insignificantly biased estimates of the instantaneous LE from the N95 model at 101 MODIS overpass times in this study, using the EF method underestimated the daily ET by 11%, while all the remaining three factors overestimated the daily ET by a range of 5%-18%. This study was conducted to provide a scientific basis for developing an operational and more accurate ET-upscaling method with easy access to data in future studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, the lack of field observations at leaf and plant level hinders our ability to understand how aerosols could affect plant water use. Aerosol concentrations in northern China fluctuate periodically over a wide range. Taking advantage of this unique natural experiment opportunity, we conducted a series of physiological and environmental measurements at different times of the day to explore diurnal aerosols' effect on leaf transpiration and sap flow of planted poplar saplings (Populus x canadensis Moench). We found that high aerosol concentrations suppressed sun leaf transpiration by reducing leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit (VPDleaf), while had no effect on shade leaf transpiration mainly because the negative effect of reduced VPDleaf on transpiration offset the positive effects of the increased stomatal conductance (g(s)). As aerosol concentration increased, the g(s) of both sun and shade leaves decreased more rapidly with an increase in VPDleaf, which caused their transpiration rates to become less sensitive to VPDleaf. Similarly, aerosols reduced sap flow density and its sensitivity to VPD. Synthesis.

Therefore, the ability of insects to survive rapid changes in temperature is an important aspect to investigate in current population ecology. The hemlock looper (HL), Lambdina fiscellaria (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), a defoliator of boreal balsam fir forests in eastern Canada, overwinters at the egg stage on tree trunks and branches where eggs can be exposed to very low subzero air temperatures. Using eggs from the island of Newfoundland (NL) and Quebec mainland (QC), we undertook field and laboratory experiments to determine: (1) their supercooling point (SCP) in mid-January and mid-February; (2) overwintering mortality; (3) cold tolerance to various combinations of subzero temperatures (-25, -30, -33, -35, or -37 degrees C) and exposure durations (2, 4, 8, 12, or 16h); and (4) potential causes of death at subzero temperatures above the SCP. Regardless of population or sampling date, eggs supercooled on average at -40.1 degrees C. In the field, 59% of eggs from either population that overwintered in Sainte-Foy (QC) and Corner Brook (NL) hatched successfully, whereas none did in Armagh (QC) or Epaule (QC). In the laboratory, 50% of eggs survived after 4h at -34.4 degrees C or after 14h at -32.9 degrees C. In contrast, regardless of exposure duration, >50% of eggs hatched at temperatures -33 degrees C, but <50% did so at -35 degrees C, suggesting high pre-freeze mortality. However, when eggs were attached to thermocouples and exposed to temperatures ranging from -25 to -37 degrees C for 16h, 69% froze at temperatures of -35 to -37 degrees C, but only 2% did at -25 or -30 degrees C. Time to freeze decreased as subzero temperatures declined, and this was more evident in island eggs than in mainland eggs. Overall, eggs can freeze after a brief exposure to subzero temperatures higher than the standard SCP, and are thus highly vulnerable to cold spells.",,,,,,"bauce, eric/0000-0002-3455-0719; Royer, Lucie/0000-0001-9438-644X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,1570-7458,,,,DEC,2013,149,3,,,,,206,218,,10.1111/eea.12123,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.12123,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000326844400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, larviculture is still a bottleneck due to the lack of protocols supporting survival and performance. Fluctuating Asymmetry (FA), which is the random deviation in bilateral symmetry in response to environmental conditions, can be used as a proxy of fish performance. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate, through microcosms experiments whether the FA levels in larvae of E. brasilianus will change with different temperatures (20 degrees C, 25 degrees and 30 degrees) and salinities (25, 30 and 35). A total of 92 larvae were analyzed. The Student t-test (p = .53) rejected the occurrence of directional asymmetry and validated the presence of FA in larvae's. The survival of larvae did not differ significantly under different temperatures (PERMANOVA; p = .58) and salinity (p = .68), probably because the early larval stage (i.e. before yolk sac assimilation) and short duration of the experiments. Eye asymmetry changed significantly among temperatures (PERMANOVA; p = .0001), but not with salinity (PERMANOVA; p = .77), revealing that waters <= 20 degrees C might have adverse effects on the Brazilian mojarra. This species is eurihaline, tolerating a wide range of salinity, explaining thus the null effect of this variable on eye asymmetry.

The contrasting water temperature regimes may remarkably affect the survival of submerged plants in the TGR. Plant survival in such prolonged flooding might depend on the carbohydrate status of the plants. Therefore, we investigated the effects of water temperature on survival and carbohydrate status in a flood-tolerant plant species and predicted that both survival and carbohydrate status would be improved by lower water temperatures. Methodology A growth chamber experiment with controlled water temperature were performed with the flood-tolerant species Arundinella anomala from the TGR region. The plants were submerged (80 cm deep water above soil surface) with a constant water temperature at 30 degrees C, 20 degrees C or 10 degrees C. The water temperature effects on survival, plant biomass and carbohydrate content (glucose, fructose and sucrose and starch) in the viable and dead tissues were investigated. Principal findings The results showed that the survival percentage of A.anomala plants was greatly dependent on water temperature. The two-month submergence survival percentage was 100% at 10 degrees C, 40% at 20 degrees C and 0% at 30 degrees C. Decreasing the water temperature led to both later leaf death and slower biomass loss. Temperature decrease also induced less reduction in glucose, fructose and sucrose in the roots and leaves (before decay, p < 0.05), but only marginally significant in the stems (p < 0.05). However, the starch content level did not differ significantly between the water temperature treatments (p > 0.05). Different water temperatures did not alter the carbon pool size in the stems, leaves and whole plants (p > 0.05), but a clear difference was found in the roots (p < 0.05), with a larger pool size at a lower temperature. Conclusions/Significance We concluded that (1) A. anomala is characterized by high flooding tolerance and sustained capability to mobilize carbohydrate pool. (2) The survival percentage and carbohydrate status of submerged A. anomala plants were remarkably improved by lower water temperatures. The survival of submergence seemed to be closely associated with the sugar content and carbohydrate pool size of the roots, which contained the lowest amount of carbohydrates.

Here we report on an experimental investigation into the effects of increased CO2 concentration and elevated temperature on sedimentary meiofaunal communities. Cohesive (muddy) and noncohesive (sandy) sediments were collected from the Eden Estuary in St. Andrews, Scotland, UK, placed within a flume setup and exposed to 2 levels of CO2 concentration (380 and 750 ppmv, current at the time of the experiment, and predicted CO2 concentration by 2100, respectively) and 2 temperature levels (12 degrees C and 16 degrees C, current in-situ and predicted temperature by 2100, respectively). We investigated the metazoan meiofauna and nematode communities before and after 28 days of exposure under these experimental conditions. The most determinative factor for abundance, diversity and community structure of meiofauna and nematodes was sediment type: on all levels, communities were significantly different between sand and mud sediments which agrees with what is generally known about the influence of sediment structure on meiofaunal organisms. Few CO2 and temperature effects were observed, suggesting that meiofauna and nematodes are generally much less responsive than, for instance, microbial communities and macrofauna to these environmental changes in estuarine environments, where organisms are naturally exposed to a fluctuating environment. This was corroborated by the observed effects related to the different seasons in which the samples were taken from the field to run the experiment. After 28 days, meiofauna and nematode communities in muddy sediments showed a greater response to increased CO2 concentration and temperature rise than in sandy sediments.

The speed of seedling emergence changes with the temperature for all species. The germination rate is modified significantly only for charophytes, with a strong decrease under cold conditions. The size of the diaspore bank explains a large part of the germination dynamics for Chara sp. and Zannichellia spp. At the end of the establishment stage, the cover is maximum under warm conditions and Callitriche truncata and Zannichellia spp. have the largest cover values.

Species biomass varies with the temperature during the establishment or (and) the growth stage, except for Zannichellia spp. There is no obvious ''preemption'' effect: the contrasted life history strategies among species allow dominance relationship modifications during the life cycle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-4026,,,,,JUL,1996,74,7,,,,,1086,1094,,10.1139/b96-133,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b96-133,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996UY56300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many seasonal phenotypic adjustments are coordinated by endogenous signals entrained to the photoperiod. The cues determining variation in the resting metabolism of ungulates remain equivocal, however, largely because of the confounding effects of food intake and thus the heat increment of feeding. To distinguish endogenous seasonal and environmental effects on metabolism, we subjected 15 female red deer to two feeding treatments, 80% food restriction and low/high protein content, over two winter seasons in a cross-over design experiment. We used rumen-located transmitters to measure heart rate and rumen temperature, which provided indices of metabolism and core body temperature, respectively. Our mixed model (R-2=0.85) indicated a residual seasonal effect on mean daily heart rate that was unexplained by the pellet food treatments, activity, body mass or air temperature. In addition to an apparently endogenous down-regulation of heart rate in winter, the deer further reduced heart rate over about 8. days in response to food restriction. We found a strong correlation between rumen temperature and seasonal or periodic variation in heart rate. An effect of lowered rumen (and hence core body) temperature was enhanced during winter, perhaps owing to peripheral cooling, which is known to accompany bouts of hypometabolism. Our experimental results therefore support the hypothesis that a reduction in body temperature is a physiological mechanism employed even by large mammals, like red deer, to reduce their energy expenditure during periods of negative energy balance.",,,,,"Arnold, Walter/C-3394-2013","Arnold, Walter/0000-0001-6785-5685; Turbill, Christopher/0000-0001-9810-7102; Ruf, Thomas/0000-0002-9235-7079",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAR,2011,214,6,,,,,963,970,,10.1242/jeb.052282,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.052282,,,,,,,,21346124,,,,,WOS:000287649500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Diet characteristics add complexity to the effect of temperature on animals' life history traits. This is even more intricate in phytophagous insects that develop inside hosts. Here, using the seed beetle Zabrotes subfasciatus Boheman we tested life history trait response to five different ambient temperatures (15, 25, 30, 35, and 45 degrees C). We also tested the effect of the interaction between temperature and diet on the weevils' life history traits and estimated fitness for individuals at different temperature and food supplementation conditions. We first showed that the relationship between temperature and egg size and number, and adult emergence is altered by sugar ingestion, mainly at 30 degrees C. Additionally, we showed that temperature and sugar ingestion have opposite effects on longevity, with this trait being heightened by sugar ingestion at 25 degrees C. Interestingly, except at 35 degrees C, egg size shows a response that opposes the temperature-size rule, which states increasing environmental temperature reduces insect's size. Finally, excluding the extreme temperatures, fitness patterns increased with temperature and the clearer effect of parental feeding on fitness was registered at 30 degrees C. Since 30 degrees C is the temperature at which our weevil populations are maintained in the laboratory, these results point to a possible long-term acclimation effect on the weevils' fitness. Thus, testing the effect of the temperature experienced by the original population on the experimental weevils' fitness might shed light on the biological explanation of the observed temperature vs diet interaction.",,,,,"Teixeira, Isabel/AAS-2029-2021","Ribeiro do Valle Teixeira, Isabel/0000-0001-6534-5016",,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6962,1365-3032,,,,DEC,2021,46,3-4,,,,,189,199,,10.1111/phen.12358,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phen.12358,,MAR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000631850900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effect of the three temperature regimes on the timing of spermiation and ovulation, on the maturation rate of males and females and on physiological and biochemical parameters of spermatozoa and oocytes were investigated. T1 was the optimal one for maturation of males and females. Under these conditions >70% of males produced semen of high quality (defined by a volume >3.5 mL, a motility rate >65%, a swimming velocity >135 mu m/sec, and a fertility >65%) for a period of 4 weeks. Females ovulated synchronously and the oocytes were of high quality, too (fertility >80%). In T2 the peak in the percentage of mature males was delayed and shortened, the percentage of spermatozoa with DNA damages increased, and peroxidase and lysozyme activity decreased which are indicative for a decrease in semen quality. In females the time point of ovulation was delayed, the fertility of oocytes was reduced, and their phospholipid and free fatty acids levels were decreased. In T3 maturation of fish was not synchronized. However, no negative effect on gamete quality was observed. J. Exp. Zool. 319A:138148, 2013.

We develop a mathematical model for vernalization that operates on multiple timescales-long term (month), short term (day), and current (hour)-and is constrained by experimental data.

Instead, temperature sensing is broadly distributed, with each thermosensory process responding to specific features of the plants' history of exposure to warm and cold.

The optimum temperature for ascocarp production was 20 degrees C; fewer chasmothecia were produced at 15 degrees C and even fewer at 25 degrees C; at 10 and 30 degrees C, no or very few chasmothecia were observed, and none reached maturity. Nonlinear equations describing ascocarp development as a function of time and temperature were developed, parameterized with data from experiments at constant temperatures, and evaluated under fluctuating temperatures. Goodness-of-fit showed high agreement between observed and predicted data: the model efficacy ranged from 0.74 to 0.97 (1.0 indicates a perfect fit), and the root mean square error ranged from 0.001 to 0.01 (zero indicates a perfect fit). The high proportion of the observed variability accounted for by these equations (R2 = 0.830.98) supported the hypothesis that temperature has a predominant role in ascocarp development under natural conditions, when all environmental factors interact. The equations tended to overestimate the production of mature chasmothecia (the coefficient of residual mass was -0.23), but this inconsistency mainly occurred when rainfall apparently washed the mature chasmothecia from leaves during the logarithmic phase of the ascocarp developmental curve.

On the basis of the different boundary conditions and sine-shaped daily and annual temperature cycles, a number of equations were proposed for calculating the thermal diffusivity that contained logarithms, arctangents of amplitudes, and the phase shift between the daily temperatures at two depths. A mean-integral solution was obtained for the estimation of the average temperature in a specific soil layer. A number of methods were developed starting from the analysis of the temperature dynamics on the basis of four daily observations at the same depth with 6-hour intervals, and nomograms were given for the rapid and simple calculation of the soil thermal diffusivity at a specific depth.

Phenotypic plasticity can help plants to overcome negative effects of temperature variability and allow them to rapidly adjust traits to adverse conditions. Moreover, genetic variation in such plasticity could provide potential for adaptive evolution in response to changing climate variability. Here, we conducted an experiment with 11 Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes to investigate intraspecific variation in plant responses to two aspects of variable temperature stress: timing and frequency. We found that the timing but not frequency of temperature stress affected the phenology, growth, reproduction and allocation strategy of plants, and that genotypes differed substantially in their responses. Moreover, trait plasticity was positively related to precipitation variability of origin, suggesting an adaptive role of plasticity. Our results indicate that the developmental stage of a plant during heat stress is a key determinant of its response, and that plasticity to temperature variability is an evolving and possibly adaptive trait in natural populations of A. thaliana.

Estuarine waters at the interface of marine and freshwater bodies are among the most volatile ecosystems, particularly for aquatic species, and will be strongly influenced by the temperature with extreme flooding events. This study aimed to quantify the acclimation capacity of coastal fish species to estuarine plume modifications. The thicklip mullet (Chelon labrosus) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) were selected as representative species of estuarine ecological guilds. These fish were subjected to an experiment mimicking a brief freshwater intrusion (35-5). These experiments were conducted at two different temperatures that these two species would encounter during their incursion from the sea through estuarine waters to freshwater habitats. The experimental results confirmed the high capacity for acclimation of both species to changes in salinity and temperature. Interspecific differences were observed. For example, the salinity has a greater effect on the metabolism of the seabass than on that of the mullets. Meanwhile, the temperature has a greater effect on the mullets. These differences in metabolic responses to fluctuating salinities and temperatures may modify the use of estuarine waters by these species and should be considered when predicting future specific distribution areas in the context of global change.

Five experimental fires were conducted in the field across plots of living vegetation. This study focussed on characterising heat transfer ahead of the flame front. The temperature and heat flux were measured at the top of the vegetation as the fire spread. The results showed the existence of two different fire spread regimes that were either dominated by radiation or governed by mixed radiant-convective heat transfer. For plume-dominated fires, the flow strongly responds to the great buoyancy forces generated by the fire; this guides the fire plume upward. For wind-driven fires, the flow is governed by inertial forces due to the wind, and the fire plume is greatly tilted towards unburned vegetation. The correlations of the temperature (ahead of the flame front) and wind velocity fluctuations change according to the fire regime. The longitudinal distributions of the radiant heat flux ahead of the fire front are also discussed. The data showed that neither the convective Froude number nor the Nelson convection number - used in the literature to predict fire spread regimes - reflect the observed behaviour of wind-driven fires.",,,,,"Silvani, Xavier/M-9625-2018","Silvani, Xavier/0000-0002-0387-1667",,,,,,,,,,,,,1049-8001,1448-5516,,,,,2010,19,5,,,,,570,582,,10.1071/WF08113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF08113,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000280708000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

When the breeding environment fluctuates across generations, reproductive traits may evolve plasticity that optimises the balance between survival and mating success for the prevailing environment. 2. For sexually selected colouration, this balance can depend on environmental temperatures. Accordingly, breeding colouration often co-varies with temperature through space and time. However, whether such traits exhibit plasticity in response to environmental temperatures is poorly understood. 3. In the present study, a dragonfly (Pachydiplax longipennis) was reared under ambient or experimentally warmed conditions and tested for plasticity in its intrasexually selected wing colouration. Although wing colouration improves male territorial success, these advantages are smaller under warmer conditions than cooler conditions. It was therefore predicted that males reared under the ambient thermal conditions of the study site (Cleveland, Ohio) would develop more wing colouration than those reared under experimentally warmed conditions. 4. Contrary to this prediction, males reared in warm larval temperatures produced more wing colouration. Thus, although the secondary sexual colouration of this species displays some thermal plasticity, it does not appear to be adaptive relative to the known thermal variation of intrasexual selection in this population. 5. Given that the environment often determines the strength and direction of sexual selection, future studies should consider the potential for non-adaptive, and even maladaptive, developmental plasticity in the sexually selected traits of insects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,JUN,2020,45,3,,,,,663,670,,10.1111/een.12839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.12839,,JAN 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000509600900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The net effluxes of CO2 from the paddy soil were lower when the paddy was flooded than when it was drained. The CO2 emissions for the drained conditions showed distinct diurnal variation with a maximum efflux observed in the afternoon. When the paddy was flooded, daytime soil CO2 fluxes reversed with a peak negative efflux just after midday. In draining/flooding alternating periods, a sudden pulse-like event of rapidly increasing CO2 efflux occured in response to re-flooding after draining.

These products are based solely on temperature and yet coral bleaching is known to result from both temperature and light stress. This study presents a novel methodology (still under development), which combines temperature and light into a single measure of stress to predict the onset and severity of mass coral bleaching. We describe here the biological basis of the Light Stress Damage (LSD) algorithm under development. Then by using empirical relationships derived in separate experiments conducted in mesocosm facilities in the Mexican Caribbean we parameterize the LSD algorithm and demonstrate that it is able to describe three past bleaching events from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). For this limited example, the LSD algorithm was able to better predict differences in the severity of the three past GBR bleaching events, quantifying the contribution of light to reduce or exacerbate the impact of heat stress.

Pairs were fed either a high or low quantity diet based on average and minimum feeding rates in the wild. Both water temperature and food supply affected reproductive output. Fewer pairs bred at elevated water temperatures and no pairs reproduced at either of the higher temperatures on the lower quantity diet. Furthermore, eggs produced were smaller at. 30.0 and 31.5 degrees C compared to those at 28.5 degrees C.

Twenty mink from a commercial mink farm were housed in a free-range enclosure (290 m(2)) at the age of 13 weeks. In the enclosure, the mink were offered 20 nest boxes (animal-to-nest-box ratio: 1:1), food ad libitum, and 3 kinds of water basins. The activity rhythms and the use of the nest boxes were assessed by an automatic registration device that recorded the amount of time spent inside or outside the nest box or in the entrance tunnel for each individual mink over a period of 18 weeks between July and December. In addition to analyzing the mink's daily and seasonal activity patterns, we sought to detect any social preferences or preferences for individual nest boxes. Results showed that the mink had crepuscular activity patterns with 2 activity peaks during dusk and dawn and that the former shifted when the daylight period shortened. Throughout the experiment, the activity time spent outside the nest boxes declined with increasing age and decreasing ambient temperature. In addition, the mink showed a preference for nest boxes that faced the feeding lots and not the water basins. During sleep and rest periods, the mink spent high amounts of time using the nest boxes in company. Furthermore, the mink structured their own habitat by using certain nest boxes for sleeping and others as latrine boxes. Small differences between male and female mink existed in their activity (i.e., time spent inside or outside nest boxes) but not in their preference for certain nest boxes or other individuals. Based on our results, any environmental enrichment item should be presented all day long, so each mink has the opportunity to use them individually during their main activity times mostly at dusk and dawn, and their daily handling should be adjusted to this rhythm. A mink-to-nest-box ratio of 1:1 does not seem necessary as juvenile mink often slept in groups of 2 or more animals in 1 nest box. Furthermore, the animals should be,given the opportunity to distinguish between a sleeping and a latrine area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Effective control or inhibition of E. coli O157:H7 growth depends on our understanding of mechanisms that regulate its growth at low temperature. We hypothesized that polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) plays a critical role in E. coli O157:H7 low-temperature growth. Methods: To test this hypothesis, the pnp deletion mutant of E. coli O157:H7 was generated using the lambda Red recombinase system, and the growth and survival of wild-type and pnp deletion mutant strains were compared at low temperatures. Results: The growth of pnp deletion mutant strains in Luria Broth (LB) and agar plate at 37 degrees C was similar to their corresponding wild-type strains, while the deletion of pnp impaired E. coli O157:H7 growth in LB at 10 degrees C and 22 degrees C; growth impairment could be partially recovered in the mutant strains by ectopic expression of the pnp complementation plasmid, demonstrating that growth impairment was PNPase-specific. During 14 days of 10 degrees C storage in both LB and milk, wild type strain EDL933 grew and reached >8 log(10) colony-forming units per milliliter after 4 days of 10 degrees C storage, while EDL933 Delta pnp gradually died off with effects more pronounced in milk, which were again mitigated by pnp overexpression. In addition, pnp deletion impaired the motility of E. coli O157:H7 but did not affect its susceptibility to H2O2.

The global analysis, which evaluates the overall effect of parameters on model output, showed that 6 out of 24 parameters account for 0 center dot 79-0 center dot 89 of the model variation.

The duration of the seed-setting phase was estimated from records of the progress of lowering on he main stem and an estimate (obtained using an optimisation procedure) of the thermal time from flowering at which the uppermost reproductive node reached the final stage of seed abortion (FSSA). The FSSA at a particular node was assumed to be achieved 200degreesC day (T-b = 4degreesC) after flowering at the same node. The grain-filling phase was assumed to run from the achievement of FSSA at the first reproductive node through to 200degreesC day (T-b 0degreesC) after the date of achievement of the FSSA by the second flowering node. The treatments (cultivar, sowing date, year) produced important ranges of above-ground biomass (AGB) at maturity (2111782 m(-2)). seed yield (SY, 119-331 g m(-2)), SN (1062-3698 seeds m(-2)) and USW (67-150 mg seed(-1)). Seed yield was strongly correlated with SN, and there was full compensation between SN and USW in large-seed cultivars in the high SO ranee. but not at lower values of SN or in small-seeded cultivars. Both PN (r = 0.83) and SN (r = 0-81, P < 0.0005) were strongly correlated with the mean daily value of the photothermal quotient (PQ = incident radiation/(mean temperature - base temperature)) for the seed-setting phase. Large- and small-seeded cultivars had PN/PQ and SN/PQ relationships with slopes which did not differ among categories but with significantly different intercepts. When the effects of low temperatures during flowering and early Train growth were allowed for, outliers on the PN/PQ and SN/PQ relationships for unstressed crops fell within the confidence limits of the respective linear regressions. Unit seed weight showed a negative response to mean temperature during the grain-filling phase in large- and small-seeded cultivars.

For this, contaminated or spiked and control soils from two different geographic origins (PT-Portugal and DK-Denmark) were used. The DK soil was from a historically contaminated study field, representing a long-term exposure to Cu while the PT soil was from a clean site and freshly spiked with Cu. Soil bacterial communities were exposed in mesocosms during 84 days to 3 different temperatures based on values typically found in each geographic region and temperature conditions that simulated a warming scenario. Obtained results indicate that Cu stress alters the structure of bacterial community and that this effect is, to some extent, temperature-dependent. Effects on bacterial diversity for both soils were also observed. Differences in the DK and PT communities' response were apparent, with the community from the historically contaminated soil being more resilient to temperature fluctuations. This study presents evidence to support the hypothesis that temperature alters the effect of metals on soils. Further, our results suggest that the definition of soils quality criteria must be based on studies performed under temperatures selected for the specific geographic region.

J,"Heuvelink, E",,,,"Heuvelink, E",,,Dry matter partitioning in tomato: Validation of a dynamic simulation model,ANNALS OF BOTANY,,,,,,,,,,,,"A model for dynamic simulation of dry matter distribution between reproductive and vegetative plant parts and the distribution among individual fruit trusses in glasshouse tomato, is validated. The model is part of the crop growth model TOMSIM and is based on the hypothesis that dry matter distribution is regulated by the sink strengths of the plant organs, quantified by their potential growth rates, i.e. the growth rates at non-limiting assimilate supply. Within the plant, individual fruit trusses are distinguished and sink strength of a truss is described as a function of its development stage. Truss development rate is a function of temperature only. The same potential growth curve, proportional to the number of fruits per truss, is adopted for all trusses. In a simple version of the model, vegetative plant parts are lumped together as one sink with a constant sink strength. In a more detailed version, vegetative sink strength is calculated as the sum of sink strengths of vegetative units (three leaves and stem internodes between two trusses). The model was validated for six glasshouse experiments, covering effects of planting date, plant density, number of fruits per truss (pruning at anthesis), truss removal (every second truss removed at anthesis), single- and double-shoot plants and a temperature experiment conducted in climate rooms at 17, 20 or 23 degrees C. Daily increase in aboveground dry weight, average daily temperatures and number of set fruits per truss were inputs to the model. Both the simple and the more detailed model showed good agreement between measured and simulated fraction of dry matter partitioned into the fruits over lime. For the simple version of the model, the slope of the lines relating simulated to measured fraction partitioned into the fruits (16 data sets), varied between 0.92 and 1.11, on average it was 1.04, implying 4% over-estimation for this fraction. For the detailed model these numbers were slightly better: 0.89, 1.08 and 1.01, respectively. The temperature experiment revealed no important direct influence of temperature on the ratio between generative and vegetative sink strength. Simulated truss growth curves showed reasonable agreement with the measurements, although both models over-estimated (17% on average) final dry weight of the lower trusses (truss 1-3) on a plant. Modelling dry matter partitioning based on sink strengths of organs is promising, as it is a general, dynamic and flexible approach, showing good agreement between measurements and simulation for a range of conditions. Applicability of the model is, however, still limited as long as the number of fruits per truss (flower and/or fruit abortion) is not simulated, as this is a major feedback mechanism in plant growth.

Acropora spp., however, are not the most common species found in Hong Kong. In the present study, we examined comparable temperature effects, both low and elevated, on Platygyra acuta, one of the most dominant coral species in Hong Kong.

Results from these experiments indicated that P. acuta fragments were generally tolerant to temperature changes within the range tested. In contrast to those observed for A. valida, they were not found to be attractive to the subsequent Drupella corallivory.

With the objective of determining whether environmental temperature is one of the possible causes which explains the observed distribution pattern, two behavioural responses were analysed during an experimental period of increasing water temperature: number of opercular movements (an indirect measure of energy expenditure) and activity levels. The interactions of temperature x time and body size x time had a significant effect on the number of opercular movements. At low temperatures (13-15degrees C, large fish reached a maximum number of opercular movements, while small fish reached a maximum only at high temperatures (23-25degreesC . The interaction temperature x time had a significant effect on activity levels of different body sizes. In general, large fish appeared to be less active than small fish, however, at very high temperatures (24-26degrees C all individuals increased their activity levels. These data indicate that small fish are acclimatized to live in a wider range of temperatures (13-23degrees C, and, for fish of all body sizes, the highest temperatures (23-26degrees C probably constitute a suboptimal microhabitat. Strong territoriality was observed, with large individuals displacing smaller individuals. These data suggest that temperature is an important factor in explaining why large individuals are not present in high tidal pools (high temperatures), whereas territoriality explains why small individuals are not in low tidal pools (habitat of large individuals).

However, little is known about how different mammalian taxa respond morphologically and physiologically to a rapid change of climate. Our objective was to provide the first quantitative data on the effect of continuous cold exposure during development on morphological and functional variables of a marsupial. Fat-tailed dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata, Dasyuridae) were reared at an ambient temperature (T-a) of 16 degrees C [cold-reared (CR)] or 22 degrees C [warm-reared (WR)] until they reached adult age (>200 days). Body and head length of CR animals were significantly longer than in WR animals (mean +/- s.e.m.; body: CR 80.8+/-6. mm, WR 76.4+/-5 mm; head: CR 29.4+/-3 mm, WR 27.5+/-2 mm), but other body attributes were not significantly different. Use of torpor was more frequent, torpor bout duration was longer and average daily metabolic rate and percentage of savings when using torpor were significantly higher (P<0.01) in CR than in WR animals at 16 degrees C T-a but not at 24 degrees C. Furthermore, resting metabolic rates measured at 16 degrees C T-a were significantly lower in CR than WR animals; at 30 degrees C T-a values were similar. Our results do not conform to Allen's rule, but to some extent they do conform to Bergmann's rule. However, the data demonstrate that a relatively moderate cold exposure from birth until adulthood induces marked changes in the morphology and thermal energetics of small marsupials. Such short-term phenotypic responses without the need for long-term selection are likely important for the ability to cope with different climates over a wide range of distribution, but will also play a crucial role in enhancing the survival of species during climate change.",,,,,"Geiser, Fritz/O-4175-2018; Riek, Alexander/H-2202-2011","Geiser, Fritz/0000-0001-7621-5049; Riek, Alexander/0000-0002-1045-6904",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAY,2012,215,9,,,,,1552,1558,,10.1242/jeb.069559,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.069559,,,,,,,,22496292,,,,,WOS:000302786300024,View Full Record in Web of Science

During feeding experiments, relative daily food intake of hatchling marine iguanas was approximately three times higher than that of adults (0.042 vs 0.013 g dry mass . g-0.8 wet mass . day-1), and mean gut passage time was two times shorter (5 vs 1 0 days). The hatchlings also maintained high body temperatures (36.7-degrees-C) even under relatively cool day-time air temperatures of 32-degrees-C. Apparent digestibility of algal food measured both during feeding trials and by Mn2+ AAS (atomic absorption spectrometry) for free-ranging iguanas was 70%, independent of body size and temperature. The red algae prevailing in the diet were high in protein (30% dry mass) and energy (12. 1 kJ/g dry mass).

These reefs are at risk from climate change, in part because altered rainfall patterns may amplify local fluctuations in salinity, impacting oyster recruitment, survival, and growth. As in other marine organisms, warming water temperatures might interact with these changes in salinity to synergistically influence oyster physiology. In this study, we used comparative transcriptomics, measurements of physiology, and a field assessment to investigate what phenotypic changes C. virginica uses to cope with combined temperature and salinity stress in the Gulf of Mexico. Oysters from a historically low salinity site (Sister Lake, LA) were exposed to fully crossed temperature (20 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and salinity (25, 15, and 7 PSU) treatments. Using comparative transcriptomics on oyster gill tissue, we identified a greater number of genes that were differentially expressed (DE) in response to low salinity at warmer temperatures. Functional enrichment analysis showed low overlap between genes DE in response to thermal stress compared with hypoosmotic stress and identified enrichment for gene ontologies associated with cell adhesion, transmembrane transport, and microtubule-based process. Experiments also showed that oysters changed their physiology at elevated temperatures and lowered salinity, with significantly increased respiration rates between 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. However, despite the higher energetic demands, oysters did not increase their feeding rate. To investigate transcriptional differences between populations in situ, we collected gill tissue from three locations and two time points across the Louisiana Gulf coast and used quantitative PCR to measure the expression levels of seven target genes. We found an upregulation of genes that function in osmolyte transport, oxidative stress mediation, apoptosis, and protein synthesis at our low salinity site and sampling time point. In summary, oysters altered their phenotype more in response to low salinity at higher temperatures as evidenced by a higher number of DE genes during laboratory exposure, increased respiration (higher energetic demands), and in situ differential expression by season and location. These synergistic effects of hypoosmotic stress and increased temperature suggest that climate change will exacerbate the negative effects of low salinity exposure on eastern oysters.",,,,,"Marquez Johnson, Kevin/Q-1310-2018","Marquez Johnson, Kevin/0000-0003-3278-3508; Jones, Hollis/0000-0003-1911-4107; Kelly, Morgan/0000-0001-6998-5053",,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,AUG,2019,59,2,,,,,306,319,,10.1093/icb/icz035,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icz035,,,,,,,,31076748,,,,,WOS:000493075400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The use of long-term datasets that cover a variety of environmental conditions will be essential for assessing possible carry-over effects of weather experienced in one season on behavior and fitness in subsequent seasons. In this study, we evaluated the effects of weather variables measured over multiple temporal scales on the reproductive performance and behavior of greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) in Osage County, Oklahoma, USA, from 2011-2019. Considering weather over a range of temporal extents allowed us to determine the relative importance of short-term weather events, such as daily temperature and precipitation, versus more chronic shifts in weather such as persistent drought on the reproductive performance of greater prairie-chickens. We used an information-theoretic model building approach to develop models describing the effects of daily weather variables and drought conditions on daily nest survival, nest incubation start dates, and clutch size. Daily nest survival was primarily influenced by conditions experienced during incubation with daily nest success declining in years with wetter than average springs and during extreme precipitation events. Daily nest survival also declined under higher maximum daily temperatures, especially in years with below-average rainfall. Greater prairie-chickens began nesting earlier and had smaller clutch sizes for initial nests and renests in years with warmer temperatures prior to the nesting season. Additionally, incubation of nests started later in drought years, indicating carry-over effects in greater prairie-chicken reproductive behaviors. Our work shows that if the weather in the Great Plains becomes more variable, with increasing frequency of drought and extreme precipitation events, wildlife species that inhabit these grassland landscapes will likely experience changes in reproduction, potentially influencing future populations.

The same quality and yield as common climate control (CCR) should be achievable fixed set points. In MTI, TI was applied with two nested control cycles. Long-term TI was applied over a 6-day period and optimum temperature was calculated in a short-term TI (24-h) with the aid of weather forecasting.

We tested this assumption and observed a slight mixing effect between 10 psu and normal marine values emphasizing the need to test this assumption in estuarine settings. Microsamples of shell carbonate were analyzed for delta O-18, delta C-13, and Mg/Ca ratios. Measured delta O-18(SHELL) and delta C-13(SHELL) were compared to predicted values to assign dates to shell samples. Once samples and dates were aligned, corresponding temperature and salinity for a particular sample were known, enabling comparison of Mg/Ca-SHELL ratios and temperature. When all Mg/CaSHELL data were compared to temperature, a weak but statistically significant correlation was observed (r(2) = 0.05, p < 0.01). Because date assignments may become increasingly uncertain further back in time and earlier studies identified ontogenetic effects in juvenile portions of shells from other bivalve species, we examined the relationship from only the last year of growth. When only data from the last year of growth were compared, a slightly stronger positive relationship between Mg/CaSHELL ratios and D-Mg (the partition coefficient) emerged (Mg/Ca-SHELL, r(2) = 0.30, p < 0.01; D-Mg, r(2) = 0.33, p < 0.01). The improved correlation may result from either ontogenetic effects influencing the incorporation of Mg into the younger portion of the shell and/or inaccurate date assignments. Regardless of the cause, our equations are similar to previously published equations for C. virginica and other taxa.

First published November 21, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00440.2012.-During winter hibernation, brown bears (Ursus arctos) reduce basal O-2 consumption rate to similar to 25% compared with the active state, while body temperature decreases moderately (to similar to 30 degrees C), suggesting a temperature-independent component in their metabolic depression. To establish whether changes in O-2 consumption during hibernation correlate with changes in blood O-2 affinity, we took blood samples from the same six individuals of hibernating and nonhibernating free-ranging brown bears during winter and summer, respectively. A single hemoglobin (Hb) component was detected in all samples, indicating no switch in Hb synthesis. O-2 binding curves measured on red blood cell lysates at 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C showed a less temperature-sensitive O-2 affinity than in other vertebrates. Furthermore, hemolysates from hibernating bears consistently showed lower cooperativity and higher O-2 affinity than their summer counterparts, regardless of the temperature. We found that this increase in O-2 affinity was associated with a significant decrease in the red cell Hb-cofactor 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) during hibernation to approximately half of the summer value. Experiments performed on purified Hb, to which DPG had been added to match summer and winter levels, confirmed that the low DPG content was the cause of the left shift in the Hb-O-2 equilibrium curve during hibernation. Levels of plasma lactate indicated that glycolysis is not upregulated during hibernation and that metabolism is essentially aerobic. Calculations show that the increase in Hb-O-2 affinity and decrease in cooperativity resulting from decreased red cell DPG may be crucial in maintaining a fairly constant tissue oxygen tension during hibernation in vivo.",,,,,"Evans, Alina/AAH-8881-2019; Malte, Hans/J-6018-2013; Fago, Angela/J-5946-2013","Fago, Angela/0000-0001-7315-2628; Frobert, Ole/0000-0002-5846-345X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0363-6119,1522-1490,,,,JAN,2013,304,1,,,,,R43,R49,,10.1152/ajpregu.00440.2012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00440.2012,,,,,,,,23174858,,,,,WOS:000313051200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature observations in the bay exhibit a diurnal cycle that is strongest near the surface (upper 10 m) and is associated with solar heating. In early summer (May June), as the upper mixed layer warms and a shallow seasonal thermocline develops, temperature fluctuations in deeper bay waters (> 15 m depth) become dominated by large semidiurnal variations (up to 2.7 degrees C) that are attributed to the internal tide. These temperature drops caused by the internal tide occur consistently twice a day under summer stratification at depths as shallow as 15 m, while smaller temperature drops (up to 1.8 degrees C) occur occasionally at 5 m. Although semidiurnal band temperatures vary seasonally, semidiurnal band currents exhibit similar magnitudes in spring and summer. This suggests that the weak temperature fluctuations in spring are due to the bay residing entirely in the upper mixed layer at this time of year, while internal tide energy continues to influence currents. Observations made along a cross-shore/vertical transect at the center of the bay with an autonomous underwater vehicle highlight the structure of cold intrusions that fill a large portion of the bay as well as the relationship between temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and backscatter. Near-bottom, advective heat flux estimates at the mouth of the bay indicate that the internal tide tends to advect cold water into the bay primarily on the northeast side of the bay entrance, with cold water outflow on the opposite side. The observations highlight the role of the internal tide along with seasonal changes in stratification in temperature variability in shallow ecosystems, particularly those close to generation sites.

Baranyi and T. A. Roberts, Int. J. Food Microbiol. 23:277-294, 1994) was applied to model the lag period and exponential growth of Listeria monocytogenes under conditions of fluctuating temperature and water activity (a(w)) values. To model the duration of the lag phase, the dependence of the parameter h(0), which quantifies the amount of work done during the lag period, on the previous and current environmental conditions was determined experimentally. This parameter depended not only on the magnitude of the change between the previous and current environmental conditions but also on the current growth conditions. In an exponentially growing population, any change in the environment requiring a certain amount of work to adapt to the new conditions initiated a lag period that lasted until that work was finished. Observations for several scenarios in which exponential growth was halted by a sudden change in the temperature and/or a(w) were in good agreement with predictions. When a population already in a lag period was subjected to environmental fluctuations, the system was reset with a new lag phase. The work to be done during the new lag phase was estimated to be the workload due to the environmental change plus the unfinished workload from the uncompleted previous lag phase.",,,,,"George, Susan/W-7494-2019; pin, carmen/C-8959-2014; Fernandez, Pablo S/K-5694-2017","Fernandez, Pablo S/0000-0002-4273-7268",,,,,,,,,,,,,0099-2240,,,,,MAY,2010,76,9,,,,,2908,2915,,10.1128/AEM.02572-09,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02572-09,,,,,,,,20208022,,,,,WOS:000276907400026,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the response of soil CH4 uptake to future climate change in the alpine meadows remains poorly understood. We carried out an alpine meadow field experiments to determine how warming and altered precipitation (drought and wetness) affect CH(4 )uptake, as well as its underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that this mesic alpine meadow was a CH4 sink under all treatments (ranging from -311.4 to -487.1 mg m- 2 CH4). Warming significantly increased CH4 uptake by an average of 18.14% of the annual cumulative CH4 uptake and by 48.68% of the non-growing season cumulative CH4 uptake. Drought enhanced the positive warming effect on CH4 uptake by decreasing soil water content, but wetness weakened this effect. Moreover, using high-throughput sequencing and GeoChip approaches, we found that warming stimulated CH4 uptake not only by increasing CH4 oxidation but also by decreasing CH4 production through changing the methanotroph community compositional structure. Further analysis revealed that the dynamics of daily CH4 uptake were mainly regulated by soil water content during the growing season, whereas daily CH4 uptake was strongly correlated with soil temperature during the non-growing season. Warming and altered precipitation influence soil CH4 uptake in different ways during the growing and non-growing seasons. Based on our results, we predict that Tibetan Plateau mesic alpine meadows will remain a net sink of CH(4 )under future climate warming and drought scenarios, but soil CH4 uptake will decrease if precipitation increases in future.",,,,,"He, Jin-Sheng/A-4053-2009; Qi, Qi/CAF-7160-2022","He, Jin-Sheng/0000-0001-5081-3569; Wang, Hao/0000-0001-9115-1290; Qi, Qi/0000-0002-7974-9609",,,,,,,,,,,,,0929-1393,1873-0272,,,,NOV,2021,167,,,,,,,,104061,10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104061,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104061,,MAY 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000691498900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In these ecosystems, groundwater level (GWL) and temperature, two factors likely to be altered by climate change, exert important control over CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes. However, little is known about the temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of the combined GHG emissions from hydromorphic soils and how this Q(10) varies with GWL. We performed a greenhouse experiment in which three different (plant-free) hydromorphic soils from a temperate spruce forest were exposed to two GWLs (an intermediate GWL of -20 cm and a high GWL of -5 cm). Net CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured continuously. Here, we discuss how these fluxes responded to synoptic temperature fluctuations. Across all soils and GWLs, CO2 emissions responded similarly to temperature and Q(10) was close to 2. The Q(10) of the CH4 and N2O fluxes also was similar across soil types. GWL, on the other hand, significantly affected the Q(10) of both CH4 and N2O emissions. The Q(10) of the net CH4 fluxes increased from about 1 at GWL = -20 cm to 3 at GWL = -5 cm. For the N2O emissions, Q(10) varied around 2 for GWL = -20 cm and around 4 for GWL = -5 cm. This substantial GWL-effect on the Q(10) of CH4 and N2O emissions was, however, hardly reflected in the Q(10) of the total GHG emissions (which varied around 2), because the contribution of these gases was relatively small compared to that of CO2.",,,,,"Janssens, Ivan A/P-1331-2014; Vicca, Sara/I-3637-2012; Flessa, Heinz/N-8427-2013","Janssens, Ivan A/0000-0002-5705-1787; Vicca, Sara/0000-0001-9812-5837; Fiedler, Sabine/0000-0001-9696-9630",,,,,,,,,,,,,1472-4677,1472-4669,,,,SEP,2009,7,4,,,,,465,476,,10.1111/j.1472-4669.2009.00205.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4669.2009.00205.x,,,,,,,,19570105,,,,,WOS:000268926300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

While studying a forested watershed in Southern Chile (40 S), we detected a DVS when the external logger was placed 1.5 m above ground, under a marked diurnal fluctuation in air temperature (amplitude 12.4 degrees C) and a dampened fluctuation in stream temperature (amplitude 1.4 degrees C). Synchronization was apparent between air and stream temperature in a direct relationship, but the synchronization between air/stream temperature and streamflow was negative, with some hours of lag time. In laboratory experiments, when the external logger is considerably warmer than the water-level logger, depth measurements can be underestimated by up to 1.5 cm.

Finally, we relocated the external logger in front of the water-level logger and inside a weir, but exposed to the air.

Modeling based on experimentally determined ventilation parameters and sedimentary O-2 and NO3- turnover rates predicted that NO3- concentrations inside the burrow and in the sediment surrounding the burrow fluctuated and were on average lower than those in the water column. In contrast, NO3- concentrations measured in the gut and hemolymph of the microcosm-incubated larvae were at least as high as in the water column.

Although consumer stress models suggest that physical extremes may often reduce predation and herbivory through negative impacts on the physiological performance of consumers, few field studies have rigorously tested how environmental variation affects feeding rates. I review and analyze field experiments that quantified per capita feeding rates of a keystone predator, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, in relation to aerial heat stress, wave forces, and water temperature at three rocky intertidal sites on the Oregon coast. Predation rates during 14-day periods were unrelated to aerial temperature, but decreased significantly with decreasing water temperature. There was suggestive but inconclusive evidence that predation rates also declined with increasing wave forces. Data-logger records suggested that thermal stress was rare in the wave-exposed habitats that I studied; sea star body temperatures likely reached warm levels (>24degreesC) on only 9 dates in 3 yr. In contrast, wind-driven upwelling regularly generated 3 to 5degreesC fluctuations in water temperature, and field and laboratory results suggest that such changes significantly alter feeding rates of Pisaster. These physiological rate effects, near the center of an organism's thermal range, may not reduce growth or fitness, and thus are distinct from the effects of environmental stress. This study underscores the need to consider organismal responses both under normal conditions, as well as under extreme conditions. Examining both kinds of responses is necessary to understand how different components of environmental variation regulate physiological performance and the strength of species interactions in intertidal communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,,,,,AUG,2002,42,4,,,,,881,891,,10.1093/icb/42.4.881,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/42.4.881,,,,,,,,21708787,,,,,WOS:000180793500021,View Full Record in Web of Science

To determine the suitability of these fertilizers for plants in semi-arid environments, these fertilizers need to be evaluated under varying placement and temperature conditions. Several urea fertilizers were evaluated, including: uncoated, sulfur-coated (SCU), polymer-coated-sulfur-coated (PCSCU), and polymer-coated (PCU) with projected release timings between 45 and 180 d. Nitrogen release was measured under daily fluctuating or static temperatures applied either to the surface or buried in the soil. A second experiment consisted of two PCU sources and added a hanging bag placement comparison and low and high soil moisture treatments. For the first Experiment, the N in uncoated urea released shortly after application. The SCU and PCSCU treatments released > 80% of the N before the first sampling date. With fluctuating temperatures, the PCU 45, 75, 120, and 180 incorporated into the soil released N within +9, +9, -22, and -68 d of their expected timing. However, they released their N within 35 d when surface applied. Conversely, with static temperatures, PCU products released slowly, releasing under 80% for the entire study. The second experiment verified these results and showed no difference between low and high moisture and minimal release with fertilizer not in contact with soil. Each coated fertilizer in these studies exhibited slow/control release properties, but the PCU (surface applied) and SCU/PCSCU (surface applied or incorporated in soil) release was much more rapid than expected. Our research suggests that, although the SCU and PCSCU showed minimal slow-release properties (regardless of placement), the PCU fertilizers incorporated in the soil do have a controlled release approximate to what is expected, but have a much more rapid release when surface applied.",,,,,"Hopkins, Bryan G./F-3670-2011","Hopkins, Bryan G./0000-0001-7313-055X; Ransom, Curtis/0000-0002-1268-7247",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUN 17,2020,15,6,,,,,,,e0234544,10.1371/journal.pone.0234544,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234544,,,,,,,,32555670,,,,,WOS:000542759600051,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, this causes problems of huge energy consumption and poor indoor air quality. In contrast, electric fans promise an indoor cooling effect with lower energy consumption. This makes the exploration of air flow utilization significative. This paper discusses the results of a research with both an online survey and a series of climate chamber experiment to study user requirements for air movement in their daily life. The online survey results showed that electric fans were widely accepted in both homes and offices because they were environmental friendly, low-cost and could provide a fresh feeling. The results of climate chamber experiment identified suitable range of indoor temperature to use electric fans and their corresponding range of air speeds. The air flow generated by electric fans could be used as an effective cooling method to maintain a comfortable environment at 28 degrees C-32 degrees C. Compared with the acceptable range of temperature and air speeds for the comfort zone recommended by the ASHRAE Standard 55-2010, this study showed that air speeds over 0.8 m/s were acceptable and they could offset a higher temperature.

Within the achieved range of E. coli concentrations in seawater (4x10-4.6x10(3) CFU/100 ml), bacteria accumulated rapidly in the bivalves, reaching the highest concentrations (plateau) after 1 h in mussels and 2 h in oysters. Under the same concentrations of E. coli in seawater, a significantly higher plateau was reached in mussels than oysters. Significant correlations between the E. coli concentration in seawater and bivalves (CR; concentration ratio) were found. The results clearly showed that CR was controlled by temperature and salinity of seawater. Changes in temperature had a strong effect on CR fluctuation, whereas in oysters an effect of changes in salinity on CR variation was also found only in oysters. The interaction between temperature and salinity was statistically significant and suggested that their simultaneous effects on CR were significantly greater than when each of these factors acted independently.

This study proposes a dynamic physical-empirical hybrid model for the transient air temperature in a stratum-ventilated classroom, concerning specific locations and dynamics in the breathing zone, accuracy to the second. The model is validated through experiments of four cases and twelve measurement points at the height of 1.1 m each case. The raw air temperature signal is divided into an approximation component maintaining the major fluctuations and a detail component representing the stochastic volatility, by a validated denoising structure using wavelet decomposition. Firstly, the dynamic model can accurately predict the raw air temperature, with the root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.04-0.07 degrees C. Secondly, the rate of air temperature variation positively correlates to the air velocity variation between the idle/duty period and the steady state, as well as the supply air velocity deviation, with the Pearson correlation coefficient value of about 0.7 (p < 0.01). Thirdly, the dynamic models for the approximation component are consistent with that for the raw air temperature signal, with an improved coefficient of determination of 0.91-0.97, and the RMSE of 0.02-0.05 degrees C. The decomposition level is the key hyperparameter to denoise the air temperature signal for approaching the modelled value.

Understanding the delay mechanism is indispensable to achieve stable production. Heat sensitivity has been shown to fluctuate throughout the day, as if it is regulated by a circadian clock. This paper studied the involvement of a circadian clock and photoperiod in the fluctuation of heat sensitivity throughout the day by applying pulses of heat at different times to Chrysanthemum seticuspe and Chrysanthemum morifolium under different regimens of light and dark. One experiment examined the elevation of heat sensitivity under different photoperiods in order to determine whether the transition from light to dark or vice versa serves as a signal for a clock-like regulation of heat sensitivity. Maximum heat sensitivity was frequently observed at a constant interval after light-off, but not after light-on, identifying the transition to darkness as the signal that initiates the elevation mechanism. We also examined the descending phase of heat sensitivity. Heat sensitivity peaked approximately 16 h after light-off and then gradually declined under dark conditions, suggesting an endogenous clock-controlled fluctuation. We further studied the effect of light on elevated sensitivity by conducting trials with dark periods of 13 or 16 h. Sensitivity peaked at both 10-13 and 13-16 h after light-off under the 16 h-dark condition, but only at 10-13 h after light-off under the 13 h-dark condition, indicating a rapid decline in heat sensitivity induced by light supplied 13 h after light-off. Results of the three experiments suggest that the daily elevation in heat sensitivity is potentially controlled by an internal clock that is reset by a transition from light to dark. A subsequent transition to light appears to eliminate elevated sensitivity. From this, we conclude that heat sensitivity is maximized toward the end of the night, irrespective of photoperiod, in chrysanthemums.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2189-0102,2189-0110,,,,,2020,89,5,,,,,602,608,,10.2503/hortj.UTD-192,http://dx.doi.org/10.2503/hortj.UTD-192,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000588727200012,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Kamenkovich, IV",,,,"Kamenkovich, IV",,,Role of daily surface forcing in setting the temperature and mixed layer structure of the Southern Ocean,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The role of high-frequency surface forcing in setting the temperature and mixed layer structure in the Southern Ocean is investigated in an ocean general circulation model. The analysis suggests that daily fluctuations in the momentum flux, and the enhanced vertical mixing they produce, have the biggest effect on the time-mean temperature and mixed layer structure. In particular, summertime (December-February) surface temperatures are cooler, subsurface temperatures are warmer, and the mixed layer is thicker in the experiment with daily forcing than in the one without. The wintertime mixed layer in the Pacific sector is, however, thinner in the presence of daily forcing owing to the enhanced density contrast between the mixed layer and the ocean below. Daily fluctuations in the surface momentum flux are the leading cause of the high-frequency temperature variability at the high latitudes of the Southern Ocean, whereas the daily variability in the surface heat flux is more important at the midlatitudes. Since the air and sea-surface temperatures do not co-vary on short timescales in this study, daily fluctuations in the air temperature/humidity cause substantial variability in the air-sea turbulent exchanges of heat. The high-frequency part of the wave number-frequency spectrum of the daily sea surface temperatures is interpreted using a conceptual model of the response of the Southern Ocean to passing atmospheric storms. For high-to-medium frequencies, the preferred wavelengths in the conceptual model are determined by fast atmospheric advection; preferred low frequencies, in contrast, are determined by slow oceanic advection.",,,,,"Kamenkovich, Igor/AAG-3451-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,JUL 13,2005,110,C7,,,,,,,C07006,10.1029/2004JC002610,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004JC002610,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000230836400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Growth rates of Stenonema spp. in artificial streams were correlated with temperature (r2 = 0.71) and were as high as 0.12 mg mg-1 d-1 in the summer. Baetis spp. growth rates were also temperature-dependent (r2 = 0.84) and summer values were even higher (0.35 d-1) than those of Stenonema. Experimental treatments at natural temperatures, but reduced algal food (no light) or reduced detrital/bacterial food (20-mu-m filtered vs. 0.5-mu-m filtered river water) showed little effect on Stenonema growth rates. Algae were a small component of the biofilm that accumulates on solid substrata (snags) and Stenonema were able to feed and grow very well on only non-algal microfine particulate organic matter and microbes. The high densities of sestonic bacteria and tendency for dissolved organic carbon to flocculate on substrata in this Coastal Plain river make it unlikely that food limits Stenonema growth rates through most of the year. These results are consistent with independent feeding experiments using radio-labelled bacteria showing that bacteria can comprise a major component of Stenonema diets and serve as an important trophic link between organic matter and macroconsumers.

Eggs of the lizard Anolis sagrei were incubated under one of three fluctuating thermal regimes that mimicked natural nest environments and differed in mean and maximum temperatures. After emergence, all hatchlings were raised under common garden conditions until reproductive maturity, at which point heat tolerance was measured.

Diapause allowsin situadaptation to adverse environmental conditions, providing sufficient parent propagules for insect pest proliferation when optimal conditions resurface. This phenomenon has however not been observed in the invasive South American tomato pinwormTuta absolutain its Mediterranean invaded areas. Moreover, no studies have looked at its overwintering survival in sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we thus investigated the cold hardiness ofTuta absolutalarvae and adults to better explain its local overwintering adaptation strategy. RESULTS Larval lower lethal temperatures ranged from -1 to -17 degrees C for 0.5 to 4 h durations. Adults showed lower temperature activity limits than larvae albeit freeze strategy experiments showed neither survived internal freezing. Fasting and dehydration pre-treatment generally depressed SCPs, although asymmetrically, conferring more negative SCPs for larvae. Ramping rates, synonymic to diurnal temperature changes also significantly affected SCPs while, inoculative freezing significantly compromised freezing temperatures in both larvae and adults. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that (i)Tuta absolutalarvae and adults are chill-susceptible and may successfully overwinter, (ii) larvae appear more cold hardy than adults and (iii) ecological factors e.g.inoculative freezing, cooling rates, feeding- and hydration-status may affect cold hardiness.

We carried out a seven-year factorial experiment with warming and nutrient addition in two alpine vegetation communities. We analyzed the relationship between fruit production and monthly mean, maximum, and min temperatures during the fall of the pre-fruiting year, the fruiting summer, and the whole fruit production period, and measured the effects of precipitation and growing and thawing degree days (GDD & TDD) on fruit production. Nutrient addition (heath: 27.88 +/- 3.19 fold change at the end of the experiment; meadow: 18.02 +/- 4.07) and combined nutrient addition and warming (heath: 20.63 +/- 29.34 fold change at the end of the experiment; meadow: 18.21 +/- 16.28) increased total fruit production and fruit production of graminoids. Fruit production of evergreen and deciduous shrubs fluctuated among the treatments and years in both the heath and meadow. Pre-maximum temperatures had a negative effect on fruit production in both communities, while current year maximum temperatures had a positive impact on fruit production in the meadow. Pre-minimum, pre-mean, current mean, total minimum, and total mean temperatures were all positively correlated with fruit production in the meadow. The current year and total precipitation had a negative effect on the fruit production of deciduous shrubs in the heath. GDD had a positive effect on fruit production in both communities, while TDD only impacted fruit production in the meadow. Increased nutrient availability increased fruit production over time in the high alpine plant communities, while experimental warming had either no effect or a negative effect. Deciduous shrubs were the most sensitive to climate parameters in both communities, and the meadow was more sensitive than the heath. The difference in importance of TDD for fruit production may be due to differences in snow cover in the two communities.",,,,,"Dai, Junhu/H-2849-2014; Erfanian, Mohammad Bagher/P-6119-2019; Alatalo, Juha/C-1269-2018","Erfanian, Mohammad Bagher/0000-0002-8671-9037; Alatalo, Juha/0000-0001-5084-850X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,AUG 25,2022,836,,,,,,,,155450,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155450,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155450,,,,,,,,35490820,,,,,WOS:000832998500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We selected a model system, three allopatric closely related species of cordylid lizards that differ in skin reflectance, to test this hypothesis. Cordylus niger and Cordylus oelofseni are melanistic and inhabit peninsular and montane areas, respectively, whereas Cordylus cordylus is more widespread and inhabits low inland areas. By combining theoretical, experimental, and field data on these species, we demonstrate that the difference in body temperature (T-b) between melanistic and non-melanistic lizards under ecologically relevant climate variation ranged from 0 degrees to 2 degrees C. Despite its small magnitude, however, the faster heating rate and higher T-b of melanistic species relative to non-melanistic species conferred an advantage under cold conditions. Comparison of habitat thermal quality (d(e)) and thermal accuracy (d(b)) across species indicated that, in winter, melanism conferred the greatest advantage during small windows of thermal opportunity. This finding was most pronounced for C. oelofseni, which is most constrained by cold temperatures in its habitat. By contrast, due to their rock-dwelling habits, melanistic and non-melanistic species benefited from rock refugia in summer, giving similar levels of thermoregulatory effectiveness across species, regardless of skin reflectance. This study therefore demonstrates that skin reflectance variation across cordylids has significant effects on their thermal balance. Furthermore, studies investigating the role of varying skin reflectance in field populations and species should incorporate. ne and broad temporal scales (daily, monthly, and seasonal), environmental variability, and cost-benefit trade-offs of thermoregulation.",,,,,,"van Wyk, JH/0000-0002-3500-4496",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,AUG,2009,90,8,,,,,2297,2312,,10.1890/08-1502.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-1502.1,,,,,,,,19739391,,,,,WOS:000268293000028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ecological studies indicate a temporal variation, including occasional absence, in the distribution of both G. cylindrata and T. parva; this led us to examine the physiological adaptations of the three species (collected at Western Bay, Twin Cays, Belize in 1985, 1986 and 1988). Each was subjected to acute, repeated exposure to either control (35 parts per thousand S) and decreased (25 parts per thousand S) salinity or to control and increased (45 parts per thousand S) salinity. Ability to regulate water and ion content (g H2O or mu mol g(-1) solute free dry wt) was examined. A. viridari behaved as a hyperosmotic conformer at decreased salinity but as an osmoconformer at increased salinity. Regardless of direction of salinity change, A. viridari regulated water content through change in Na+, K+, and Cl- contents. In contrast, G. cylindrata behaved as an osmoconformer and did not demonstrate ability to regulate water content. T. parva behaved as an osmoconformer, showed incomplete regulation of water content via change in Na+, K+, and Cl- contents but had limited survival following exposure to 45 parts per thousand S. Each species was also exposed to change in temperature. Species were subjected to acute, repeated exposure either to control (28 degrees C) and decreased (21 degrees C) temperature or to control and increased (35 degrees C) temperature. A. viridari regulated water and ion content under both experimental conditions. In contrast, T. parva did not regulate water and ion content under either experimental temperature. G. cylindrata did not regulate water and ion content during exposure to decreased temperature and did not survive exposure to increased temperature. For A. viridari, weight specific oxygen uptake rates (mg O-2 g(-1) ash-free dry wt) were determined. Exposure to decreased salinity or to increased temperature resulted in a small sustained elevation in O-2 uptake. It is concluded that, unlike A. viridari, T. parva and G. cylindrata are only marginally adapted to withstand the salinity and temperature stresses, respectively, of the mangrove habitat. The inability of T. parva and G. cylindrata to fully adapt to extremes in the mangrove habitat could well explain the temporal variation seen in the distribution of these two species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,,,,,OCT,1994,120,3,,,,,397,406,,10.1007/BF00680213,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00680213,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PP94500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

An experimental aviary offered two artificial tree-roosts with different microclimatic conditions which varied according to the outdoor conditions (mainly due to solar radiation) and microclimate retention capability of roosts. Birds actively explored roosts before the final choice of sleeping site. Two hours prior to sunset, there were significant differences between the roosts (n = 11 adult males tested, each six nights).

Therefore, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, which results in ocean acidification/carbonation, is predicted to have a positive impact on seagrass productivity. Previous studies have confirmed the positive influence of increasing CO2 on photosynthesis and survival of the temperate eelgrass Zostera marina, but the acclimation of photoprotective mechanisms in this context has not been characterized. We aimed to quantify the long-term impacts of ocean acidification on photochemical control mechanisms that promote photosynthesis while simultaneously protecting eelgrass from photodamage. Eelgrass were grown in controlled outdoor aquaria at different aqueous CO2 concentrations ranging from similar to 50 to similar to 2100 mu M from May 2013 to October 2014 and examined for differences in leaf optical properties. Even with daily and seasonal variations of temperature and light, CO2 enrichment consistently increased plant size, leaf thickness and chlorophyll use efficiency, and decreased pigment content and the package effect while maintaining similar lightharvesting efficiency. These acclimation responses suggest that a common photosynthetic sensory function, such as redox regulation, can be manipulated by COCO(2)2 availability, as well as light, and may serve to optimize photosynthetic carbon gain by seagrasses into the Anthropocene.",,,,,"Ergin, Billur Celebi/Y-9577-2018","Ergin, Billur Celebi/0000-0002-9949-1617",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,AUG 5,2021,671,,,,,,111,128,,10.3354/meps13777,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps13777,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000691313900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature is such a potential cue in temporary waterbodies, as if fluctuates more widely with decreasing pond size than in deeper permanent ponds. We compared the temperature-induced response of a permanent-pond and a temporary-pond cyclopoid copepod focusing on juvenile development duration, diapause induction and survival during diapause. Nonlinear regression analysis suggested a stronger effect of temperature on the duration of juvenile development in the temporary-pond species. This species also showed a higher and temperature-dependent variation in development duration (highest coefficient of variation 26%) compared with the permanent species, for which variation was lower and similar at all temperatures (maximal coefficient of variation 6%). Temperature significantly influenced the induction of diapause in the temporary-pond species, where the percentage of individuals entering diapause increased from 0% at 5degreesC and 10degreesC to 63% at 15degreesC and 91% at 20degreesC. In the permanent-pond species, diapause induction was independent of temperature and was induced in 100% of experimental specimens. This suggests an obligatory diapause in the permanent-pond species, a type of dormancy that has not been described previously for cyclopoid copepods. Survival during diapause in both species was higher when the diapausing copepodid stage was reached at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, the temporary-pond species survived longer than the permanent-pond species. These results suggest different temperature optima of the two species. The strategy displayed by the permanent-pond species might be selected for in more stable habitats and may preclude the colonization of temporary ponds. Higher flexibility in life-history traits and the use of temperature as an environmental cue in the temporary-pond species could be favoured in unpredictable habitats.",,,,,"Frisch, Dagmar/AAE-9499-2019; Frisch, Dagmar/F-6363-2012","Frisch, Dagmar/0000-0001-9310-2230; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-0613,1937-3791,,,,MAY,2004,6,4,,,,,541,553,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000221990800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In mammals, only the number of cervical vertebrae is invariable. Variation of total vertebral centra numbers is well documented in teleost fish, often related to temperature. Less information is available about which part of the vertebral column and which associated elements are liable to variation. Here, variation in number of vertebral centra and associated elements is studied in Chinook salmon in six distinct anatomical regions. Animals are raised at 8 and 12 degrees C to ask whether the vertebral centrum numbers, the pattern, and the frequency of variation in particular regions are temperature dependent. No significant difference concerning the total number of vertebrae was found, but regional differences occurred between the 8 and 12 degrees C groups. Twelve specimens out of 60 of the 12 degrees C group had three postcranial vertebrae compared to only one specimen in the 8 degrees C group. The number of transitional vertebrae is significantly different in 8 and 12 degrees C specimens. Fewer transitional vertebrae occur in more anterior positions in 8 degrees C specimens.

Specimens of the 12 degrees C group show more variation in the presence of the vestigial ribs associated with transitional vertebrae. Clearly, the postcranial, transitional, and ural regions are temperature sensitive.

High temperatures (19 degrees C, 22 degrees C) alone did not produce additional changes in the stress indicators. However, high pH induced significant additional rises in glucose and cortisol levels in both high-and control-temperature tanks. At low temperatures the stress response was delayed; low temperature (7-9 degrees C) alone produced significant elevations in glucose and cortisol compared with controls at 24 h, suggesting that cold water acted as a stressor, albeit with a delayed reaction. Cold water combined with high pH induced higher cortisol concentrations after 24 h than high pH alone. Warm temperatures combined with high pH did not synergistically affect the stress response, but they significantly increased mortality at 22 degrees C. Mortality in the field occurred at pH levels greater than 9.3-9.4 and temperatures of 19.9-22.8 degrees C. Diel fluctuations in pH measured in four reservoirs ranged 0.1-0.5 units.

We found positive effects of acclimation on thermotolerance range, especially on the thermal critical minimum of both species. In contrast, CCRT did not respond to acclimation in either. Our results reveal the plasticity of these Triatomines thermal tolerance in response to a wide range of acclimation temperatures.

However, winter soil carbon dynamics in these areas, which are often characterized by shallow snow cover, are poorly understood due to infrequent sampling at the soil surface. Our objectives were to continuously measure winter CO2 flux from soils and the overlying snowpack while also monitoring drivers of winter soil respiration in a humid temperate forest. We show that the relative roles of soil temperature and moisture in driving winter CO2 flux differed within a single soil-to-snow profile. Surface soil temperatures had a strong, positive influence on CO2 flux from the snowpack, while soil moisture exerted a negative control on soil CO2 flux within the soil profile. Rapid fluctuations in snow depth throughout the winter likely created the dynamic soil temperature and moisture conditions that drove divergent patterns in soil respiration at different depths. Such dynamic conditions differ from many previous studies of winter soil microclimate and respiration, where soil temperature and moisture are relatively stable until snowmelt. The differential response of soil respiration to temperature and moisture across depths was also a unique finding as previous work has not simultaneously quantified CO2 flux from soils and the snowpack. The complex interplay we observed among snow depth, soil temperature, soil moisture, and CO2 flux suggests that winter soil respiration in areas with shallow seasonal snow cover is more variable than previously understood and may fluctuate considerably in the future given winter climate change.",,,,,"Frey, Serita D/Y-3397-2019; Varner, Ruth K/E-5371-2011","Frey, Serita D/0000-0002-9221-5919; Varner, Ruth K/0000-0002-3571-6629; Burakowski, Elizabeth/0000-0001-5429-9886; Contosta, Alexandra/0000-0002-1201-1765",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-8953,2169-8961,,,,DEC,2016,121,12,,,,,3072,3088,,10.1002/2016JG003450,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JG003450,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000393134800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experiments were conducted to determine chilling requirements for completion and breaking of diapause and development rate of larvae at different temperatures in the laboratory. Egg hatch required at least 4 mo for induction of diapause, and approximate to 200 growing degree-days (GDD) at a calculated base temperature of 8.2 degrees C for breaking of diapause in the laboratory. Development of all larval instars was significantly faster at 22 than at 17 degrees C and faster at 27 than at 22 degrees C, but 27 degrees C appeared to be nearing the upper developmental threshold, because mortality was uniformly high, and deformities of adults were observed. We confirmed that larvae pass through three instars and found that head capsule width increased geometrically with instar. We calculated the larval developmental threshold to be approximate to 11.7 degrees C at constant temperatures in the laboratory. Development under ambient conditions, where temperatures fluctuate, was considerably faster than that observed in the laboratory at constant temperatures. Thus, rearing experiments conducted in the laboratory at constant temperatures provide useful estimates of threshold temperatures but unrealistic estimates of GDD thresholds for P. viburni and other insects whose developmental rate differs between constant and fluctuating temperatures.",,,,,"Weston, Paul/H-6638-2014","Weston, Paul/0000-0002-9720-8283",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,,,,,OCT,2005,34,5,,,,,985,989,,10.1603/0046-225X(2005)034[0985:TRADOI]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2005)034[0985:TRADOI]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000232405800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Correlations between methane flux and water table position were significant at all sites for one annual cycle when water table fluctuations ranged from 15 cm above to 50 cm below the peat surface. Correlations were not significant during the second and third annual periods with smaller water table fluctuations. Methane flux was strongly correlated with peat temperatures at -5 to -40 cm (r(s) = 0.82 to 0.98) for all three years at sites with flora acting as conduits for methane transport. At shrub sites, the correlations between methane flux and pear temperature were weak to not significant during the first two years, but were strong in the third year. Low rates of methane consumption (-0.2 to -1.5 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) were observed at shrub sites when the water table was below -20 cm, while sites with plants capable of methane transport always had positive net fluxes of methane. The methane oxidizing potential at both types of sites was confirmed by pear core experiments. The results of this study indicate that methane emissions occur at rates that cannot be explained by diffusion alone; plant communities play a significant role in altering methane flux from peatland ecosystems by directly transporting methane from anaerobic pear to the atmosphere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-2563,,,,,,1994,27,1,,,,,35,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PU50800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies have shown that various signals can be affected by changes in temperature. However, research into the effect of temperature on mating signals and subsequently communication between mates and on female choice is still rare. In the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis, which emerges early in spring and is therefore subject to extensive temperature changes, females choose suitable males based on, among other criteria, their thorax vibrations and odor. So far there has been no research into the effect of temperature changes on these signals. We therefore investigated whether the environmental temperature has an influence on the male's mating signals by measuring vibrations using a laser vibrometer and collecting male and female odor at different temperatures. Furthermore, we performed behavioral experiments in order to show whether there is an effect of temperature-induced changes and female choice. Our results showed that rejected males differed in their vibrations between the two temperature settings but accepted ones did not. Temperature changes therefore seem to have a stronger effect on those males that are rejected by the females, whereas the accepted males are the ones that can produce desirable signals despite temperature fluctuations. Furthermore, we found that the differences in odor profiles were greater between temperature settings than between the sexes and that females change their preference for odor with temperature. We conclude that temperature strongly influences the male mating signals and therefore may have a major impact on sexual selection in this species. This is an important aspect to consider, not only in future studies on mating behavior, but also in view of our ever raising temperatures.",,,,,,"Conrad, Taina/0000-0002-0115-498X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,NOV,2017,7,21,,,,,8966,8975,,10.1002/ece3.3331,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3331,,,,,,,,29152191,,,,,WOS:000414873600028,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ascending and descending passes of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System Sensor (AMSR-E) observed the Antarctic ice sheet in the afternoon (the warmest period) and at midnight (a cold period), enabling us to make full use of the diurnal amplitude variations (DAV) in brightness temperature (T-b) to detect snowmelt. The DAV in vertically polarized 36.5 GHz T-b (DAV36V) is extremely sensitive to liquid water and can reduce the effects of the structural changes in snowpacks during melt seasons. A set of controlled experiments based on the microwave emission model of layered snow (MEMLS) were conducted to study the changes of the vertically polarized 36.5 GHz T-b (Delta 36V) during the transitions from dry to wet snow regimes. Results of the experiments suggest that 9 K can be used as a DAV36V threshold to recognize snowmelt. The analyses of snowmelt suggest that the Antarctic ice sheet began to melt in November and became almost completely frozen in late March of the following year. The total cumulative melt area from 2002 to 2011 was 2.44 x 10(6) km(2), i.e., 17.58% of the Antarctic ice sheet. The annual cumulative melt area showed considerable fluctuations, with a significant (above 90% confidence level) drop of 5.24 x 10(4) km(2)/year in the short term. Persistent snowmelt (i.e., melt that continues for at least three days) detected by AMSR-E and hourly air temperatures (T-air) were very consistent. Though melt seasons became longer in the western Antarctic Peninsula and the Shackleton Ice Shelf, Antarctica was subjected to considerable decreases in duration and melting days in stable melt areas, i.e., -0.64 and -0.81 days/year, respectively.

In this work, we conducted chemical marking and recapture techniques to study the fluctuation of delta O-18 values of oyster shells of the species Magallana gigas reared in natural environment in Normandy (France) for two years. The results were compared to the continuous monitoring of temperature and salinity and monthly records of seawater delta O-18. Isotopic measurements were performed on the hinge area that regroups the whole life of the oysters. Here we demonstrate that oysters mineralized their shells with no significant growth breaks during the two-years experiment, even at temperatures below 6 degrees C. The results confirm that adult oysters (i.e. > 1 yr) mineralized their shells at equilibrium. However, juvenile specimens exhibit a strong isotopic disequilibrium, with a maximum shift of the delta O-18 values of 3% in winter, likely due to kinetic isotope effects. This corresponds to a reconstructed temperature up to 13 degrees C warmer than expected. This work indicates that although these oyster shells can be used as an accurate archive of (paleo)environmental conditions, the shell portion mineralized during the juvenile stage (i.e. < 1 yr) should be avoided for paleotemperature reconstructions.

Pooled field training data from several sites and seasons were used to parameterise the model. N2O fluxes were assigned one of three values: the geometric means of the ranges 1-10, 10-100 and 100-1,000 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1), respectively, depending on threshold lines (a) relating flux and N-min and (b) relating flux, WFPS and T. The model was applied to give daily and seasonal total fluxes, and the overall relationships with measured emissions from ammonium nitrate treatments were analysed separately for those site-seasons not used as a source of training data, for the training data site-seasons, and for all site-seasons together. Results for both training and non-training site-seasons showed, with some exceptions, reasonable agreement with experimental measurements in the timings of main emission peaks, and also in the magnitude of daily flux rate variations over time. Generally, modelled seasonal N2O emissions were somewhat higher than measured values, possibly because at very high WFPS values the actual N2O flux was lower than predicted as a result of greater reduction of nitrate to N-2, rather than release as N2O. However, one site was an outlier, with predicted emissions much lower than those observed.

We studied the effects of these scenarios on flowering phenology and flower production of Andromeda polifolia (woody evergreen) and Rubus chamaemorus (perennial herb) during 2 years. The second year of our study (2002) was characterized by unusually high spring and early summer temperatures. Our winter manipulations led to consistent increases in winter snow cover. As a result, average and minimum air and soil temperatures in the high snow cover treatments were higher than in the winter ambient treatments, whereas temperature fluctuations were smaller. Spring warming resulted in higher average, minimum, and maximum soil temperatures. Summer warming led to higher air and soil temperatures in mid-summer (June-July), but not in late summer (August-September). The unusually high temperatures in 2002 advanced the median flowering date by 2 weeks for both species in all treatments. Superimposed on this effect, we found that for both Andromeda and Rubus, all our climate treatments (except summer warming for Rubus) advanced flowering by 1-4 days. The total flower production of both species showed a more or less similar response: flower production in the warm year 2002 exceeded that in 2001 by far. However, in both species flower production was only stimulated by the spring-warming treatments. Our results show that the reproductive ecology of both species is very responsive to climate change but this response is very dependent on specific climate events, especially those that occur in winter and spring.

A continuous period of PSW was not necessary for successful infection. Successive short periods of PSW were not strictly additive. A dry period following a wet period delayed the start of infection for longer than the duration of the dry period. The length of the delay depended on the preceding degrees h PSW and on the duration of the dry period. From this information, a model was constructed to predict when first infections could be expected. This model was tested in small plot held experiments in two seasons.

We used a six-year (2005-2010) grazing experiment to test the prediction that the relative abundance of C4 plants (P-C4) in the semi-arid grassland of Inner Mongolia is related to growing-period temperature and disturbance by grazing. Paddocks were stocked with sheep at six rates (0.375-2.25 sheep ha(-1) a(-1)) between June and September. P-C4 was estimated from the relative C-13/C-12 composition (delta C-13) of wool grown during the grazing period of each year and a two-member mixing model of the delta C-13 of the C3 and C4 communities in the paddocks. Stocking rate had a slight effect (<0.5 parts per thousand) on the delta C-13 of the C3 and the C4 end-members. Annual average P-C4 varied between 5% and 24%. Stocking rate had no significant effect on P-C4 but the growing-season temperature had a large effect, and Pot increased with temperature. Importantly, the growing season shifted between years due to changing seasonal distribution of rainfall and soil moisture availability from winter precipitation causing large variation in temperature of the effective growing season. Changes in temperature and in amount and seasonal distribution of rainfall as a consequence of inter-annual fluctuations and long-term change can thus have a large impact on the C4 abundance and its spatial pattern.",,,,,"Auerswald, Karl/C-5186-2008; Schnyder, Hans/B-7089-2011","Auerswald, Karl/0000-0001-5275-4320; Schnyder, Hans/0000-0002-0139-7535; Taube, Friedhelm/0000-0001-7175-2881",,,,,,,,,,,,,1439-1791,,,,,,2012,13,1,,,,,67,75,,10.1016/j.baae.2011.11.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2011.11.004,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000301277500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study addresses Fourier-series-based evaluation and prediction of hourly ambient air humidity fluctuation. It is shown that hourly ambient humidity fluctuation displays a significant 24-hour cyclical variation. Then on the basis of daily periodic extension for hourly ambient air humidity fluctuation, a finite Fourier-series-based evaluation model is introduced for describing its hourly fluctuation. The Fourier-based analysis in its conventional form, however, cannot be straightly applicable to prediction. Then in combination with the least-squares method for coefficient-seeking based on finite observations of hourly air humidity, the extended version of the Fourier-series model in the least-squares is proposed for forecasting. The proposed Fourier-series-based method is applied to experiments of evaluating and forecasting hourly air humidity fluctuations at different monitoring stations with satisfying results. The experimental results, further mathematical analysis of the conjugate symmetry property and spectrum characteristic analysis for the Fourier-series involved in the Fourier-based model indicate that daily 24-hour air humidity fluctuation is well described by about 12-term harmonics and the extended Fourier-series forecasting model predicts the hourly humidity fluctuation best fitting with less than 6-term harmonics.

However, this subject is poorly addressed. In the order Mesostigmata, an abundance of species lives in the soil. Among these species, Stratiolaelaps scimitus (Womersley) is a predator used in the control of pest organisms that live in the soil. Mites of this species are commercialized in several countries, including Brazil, presenting efficiency in pest control in several crops. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of thermal shock on S. scimitus females, as well as to monitor the temperature variation in the environment. For each temperature, 80 experimental units were assembled for different periods (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h). Experimental units were maintained at 25 degrees C, after exposure of the mites. Mortality and oviposition were evaluated. The results showed a 40% reduction in the survival of mites exposed to 37 degrees C for 4 h, compared to the control treatment (25 degrees C). Oviposition was less affected at 1 h exposure to temperatures of 19 and 12 degrees C and thermic fluctuation was observed in the greenhouse, especially inside the slabs.

For secondary forest pests, such as the pine bark beetle Ips sexdentatus, the resulting increase in population level could trigger more frequent outbreaks. However, this positive effect could be outweighed by a temperature-dependent decrease in offspring quality. To test these hypotheses, we carried out a laboratory rearing experiment with maritime pine logs at six temperature regimes reproducing hourly fluctuations and averaging 12-25.5 degrees C. We estimated the thermal requirements for a complete development of the beetle and the number of offspring per female. The offspring quality was estimated using three traits: dry body weight, elytra length and lipid content. The minimum and maximum developmental threshold were estimated at 10.9 and 36 degrees C, respectively, and the thermal requirements for complete development were estimated at 517 degree-days. We predicted a mean of two generations per year in southwestern France, although an additional generation could occur during warmer years. The number of offspring increased exponentially with temperature, although we observed a curvilinear response of offspring traits to temperature, with optima at 15-18 degrees C. This suggests that there are trade-offs between productivity and quality of offspring. Global warming is therefore likely to result in higher number of generations of I. sexdentatus per year, with larger broods but of reduced fitness at high temperatures.",,,,,"David, Guillaume/AAH-5138-2021; DAVID, Guillaume/GXZ-9649-2022","David, Guillaume/0000-0002-2692-0409; Salle, Aurelien/0000-0003-3876-9272",,,,,,,,,,,,,1461-9555,1461-9563,,,,FEB,2017,19,1,,,,,23,33,,10.1111/afe.12177,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.12177,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391954400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Day degrees per day could be related to age-specific changes in the daily rate of yeast autolysate and sucrose consumption, the rate of accumulated consumption of these foods, and thus the time taken to consume the amount of yeast autolysate known to be required for the attainment of sexual maturity.

The number of model parameters is reduced using allometric relationships. The model can represent more isohydric (pinon) and more anisohydric (juniper) responses. Analysis of the parameter space suggests four main controls on hydraulic failure and carbon starvation: xylem vulnerability curve, root:shoot area ratio, rooting depth and water use efficiency. For pinon, an intermediate optimal (1.5-2 m(2) m(-2)) tree leaf area index reduces the risk of hydraulic failure. For both pinons and junipers, hydraulic failure was relatively insensitive to root:shoot ratio across a range of tree LAI. Higher root: shoot ratios however strongly decreased the time to carbon starvation. The hydraulic safety margin of pinons is strongly diminished by large diurnal variations in xylem/leaf water potential. Diurnal drops of water potential are mitigated by high maximum hydraulic conductivity, high root:shoot ratio and stomatal regulation (more isohydric). The safety margin of junipers is not very sensitive to diurnal drops in water potential so that there is little benefit in stomatal regulation (more anisohydric). Narrower tracheid diameter and a narrower distribution of tracheid diameters reduce the risk of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation by reducing diurnal xylem water potential drop. Simulated tree diameter-dependent mortality varies between these two species, with pinon mortality decreasing with increasing tree size, whereas juniper mortality increases with tree size. Juvenile pinons might thus be overimpacted by water stress.

Current methods used to estimate ecosystem respiration (ER) do not include diel ER fluctuations, which limit testing predictions about short-term drivers of ecosystem metabolism. Diel changes in delta O-18(O2) can be used to estimate diel ER due to discrimination against O-18(O2) during respiration. We monitored diel delta O-18(O2), O-2, light, and water temperature in three Wyoming streams and measured respiration fractionation (alpha(R)) against O-18(O2) in dark benthic flow chambers in two streams. The ranges of measured and literature alpha(R) values were used to estimate uncertainty in metabolism parameters associated with not measuring alpha(R) directly. Daytime ER was 54-340% higher than nighttime ER using delta O-18(O2), but diel ER parameter estimates were highly uncertain relative to traditional estimates of ecosystem metabolism. Diel variations in water temperature only accounted for 4-55% of the range of diel ER calculated using diel delta O-18(O2). Measured benthic flow chamber alpha(R) varied within the range of literature values: from 0.9755 to 0.9954. Metabolism parameter estimates were very sensitive to choice of alpha(R) within the measured and published range of values. The mean and uncertainty of diel ER estimates increased with decreasing alpha(R), with daily ER more than ten times higher given an alpha(R) of 0.975 vs. 0.999. Diel changes in ER can be modeled using delta O-18(O2) and O-2, but diel ER estimates depend on the choice of alpha(R), suggesting the need to better understand how alpha(R) may vary within spatial and temporal scales appropriate for delta O-18(O2) metabolism models.",,,,,,"Hotchkiss, Erin/0000-0001-6132-9107",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,MAY,2014,59,3,,,,,798,810,,10.4319/lo.2014.59.3.0798,http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2014.59.3.0798,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000339904300013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dietary chlorogenic acid, rutin and tomatine levels reflected those occurring naturally in the leaves of tomato, a hostplant of this herbivore. We compared the effects of four thermal regimes having a daytime temperature of 26 degrees C, with the night-time temperature increased from 14 to 26 degrees C by increments of 4 degrees C. The effect of a particular allelochemical on developmental rate was similar among the four thermal regimes. Chlorogenic acid and tomatine each reduced final larval weight, but there was no effect of night-time temperature. In contrast, rutin had no effect on final weight, whereas final weight declined with increasing night-time temperature. Night-time temperature did not influence amount eaten. Larvae ate less when chlorogenic acid or tomatine was in the diet. For each allelochemical, there were no allelochemical by thermal regime interactions. In addition, we compared the effects of allelochemicals and the thermal regime of 26:14 degrees C and constant 20 degrees C, which was the average temperature of the 26:14 degrees C regime. Developmental rate was lower at the constant 20 degrees C regime, chlorogenic acid and tomatine each depressed developmental rate, and there were no allelochemical by thermal regime interactions. Thus, regardless of the specific allelochemical or amount, the pattern of response at the fluctuating regime was similar to that at the constant temperature. In contrast, comparison of the thermal regime of 26:22 degrees C and constant 24 degrees C, which was the average temperature of the 26:22 degrees C regime, showed several allelochemical by thermal regime interactions. At the 26:22 degrees C regime, developmental rate was disproportionatly higher at the maximal rutin concentration compared to that at constant 24 degrees C. At the constant 24 degrees C, final larval mass was disproportionately lower at the moderate tomatine concentration compared to that at the 26:22 degrees C regime. Because these results differ from that of other studies examining another species, it appears that the response to incremental changes in night-time temperature will reflect the allelochemicals and insect species tested. The contrast between the constant 24 degrees C and 26:22 degrees C regimes indicates that even small fluctuations (+/-2 degrees C) in temperature over 24 h can yield differences in the response to an allelochemical.",,,,,"Stamp, Nancy E/C-3806-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,1570-7458,,,,APR,1997,83,1,,,,,63,72,,10.1046/j.1570-7458.1997.00157.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1570-7458.1997.00157.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997WV48200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

We conducted an experiment to evaluate the impacts of global warming on the phenology and yield of two determinate soybean cultivars in a temperate region (37.27 8 degrees N, 126.99 degrees E; Suwon, South Korea). These two soybean cultivars, Sinpaldalkong [maturity group (MG) IV] and Daewonkong (MG VI), were cultured on various sowing dates within a four-year period, under no water-stress conditions. Soybeans were kept in greenhouses controlled at the current ambient temperature (AT), AT+ 1.5 degrees C, AT+ 3.0 degrees C, and AT+ 5.0 degrees C throughout the growth periods. Growth periods (VE-R7) were significantly prolonged by the elevated temperatures, especially the R1-R5 period. Cultivars exhibited no significant differences in seed yield at the AT+ 1.5 degrees C and AT+ 3.0 degrees C treatments, compared to AT, while a significant yield reduction was observed at the AT+ 5.0 degrees C treatment. Yield reductions resulted from limited seed number, which was due to an overall low numbers of pods and seeds per pod. Heat stress conditions induced a decrease in pod number to a greater degree than in seed number per pod. Individual seed weight exhibited no significant variation among temperature elevation treatments; thus, seed weight likely had negligible impacts on overall seed yield. A boundary line analysis (using quantile regression) estimated optimum temperatures for seed number at 26.4 to 26.8 degrees C (VE-R5) for both cultivars; the optimum temperatures (R5-R7) for single seed weight were estimated at 25.2 degrees C for the Sinpaldalkong smaller-seeded cultivar, and at 22.3 degrees C for the Daewonkong larger-seeded cultivar. The optimum growing season (VE-R7) temperatures for seed yield, which were estimated by combining the two boundary lines for seed number and seed weight, were 26.4 and 25.0 inverted perpendicular C for the Sinpaldalkong and Daewonkong cultivars, respectively. Considering the current soybean growing season temperature, which ranges from 21.7 (in the north) to 24.6 degrees C (in the south) in South Korea, and the temperature response of potential soybean yields, further warming of less than approximately 1 degrees C would not become a critical limiting factor for soybean production in South Korea.",,,,,,", Byun-Woo/0000-0003-2284-1348",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,NOV 3,2016,11,11,,,,,,,e0165977,10.1371/journal.pone.0165977,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165977,,,,,,,,27812185,,,,,WOS:000386910000087,View Full Record in Web of Science

Metabolic rate responses to changes in temperature were estimated by measuring the activity of the electron transport system (ETS) in muscle tissue and in vivo rates of oxygen consumption. Lipofuscin accumulation oscillated with simulated seasonal changes in temperature and was described by seasonalised von Bertalanffy growth functions. The incremental accumulation in lipofuscin between sampling dates was linearly related to the number of degree days that accumulated between dates, irrespective of the amplitude of temperature fluctuation that had occurred. ETS activity increased with acclimation temperature and was modelled using a polynomial function. This indicated a lower temperature sensitivity in the temperature mid-range (12 to 16 degreesC), although the Q(10) for this mid-range was 2.1. ETS activity ill lobsters acclimated to 8 and 18 degreesC and assayed at 13 degreesC was similar, indicating no compensation for changes in environmental temperature. Oxygen consumption rate was significantly higher at 14 degreesC than at 10.5 degreesC and had a Q(10) of 3.6, again suggesting no compensation to temperature change. The absence of metabolic compensation in response to temperature change in H. gammarus to is consistent with the predictability of changes in temperature and food availability in the sub-littoral environment of this species. As lipofuscin accumulates according to metabolic rate, and metabolic rate in H. gammarus is directly correlated with temperature, geographic differences and long-term temporal trends in temperature will need to be considered when converting physiological age indices, obtained from lipofuscin estimates, to a chronological scale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,,,,,DEC,2000,137,5-6,,,,,1031,1040,,10.1007/s002270000410,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002270000410,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000166005800030,View Full Record in Web of Science

The molecular basis of temperature-dependent flowering-time regulation has been extensively studied, but little is known about how gene expression is controlled in natural environments. Without a memory of past temperatures, it would be difficult for plants to detect seasons in natural, noisy environments because temperature changes occurring within a few weeks are often inconsistent with seasonal trends. Our 2-y census of the expression of a temperature-dependent flowering-time gene, AhgFLC, in a natural population of perennial Arabidopsis halleri revealed that the regulatory system of this flowering-time gene extracts seasonal cues as if it memorizes temperatures over the past 6 wk. Time-series analysis revealed that as much as 83% of the variation in the AhgFLC expression is explained solely by the temperature for the previous 6 wk, but not by the temperatures over shorter or longer periods.

Our model organism is the collembolan Orchesella cincta that occurs in a wide variety of habitats and is known to be adapted to local thermal conditions. Because sequence information is lacking in O. cincta, we constructed cDNA libraries enriched for temperature-responsive genes using suppression subtractive hybridization. We compared gene expression of O. cincta with steep thermal reaction norms (high plasticity) to those with flat thermal reaction norms (low plasticity) for juvenile growth after exposure to a temperature switch composed of a cooling or a warming treatment. Using suppression subtractive hybridization, we found differential expression of ten nuclear genes, including several genes involved in energy metabolism, such as pantothenate kinase and carbonic anhydrase. In addition, seven mitochondrial genes were found in the cloned subtracted library, but further analysis showed this was caused by allelic variation in mitochondrial genes in our founder population, and that a specific haplotype was associated with high thermal responsiveness.

J,"Hall, JM; Warner, DA",,,,"Hall, Joshua M.; Warner, Daniel A.",,,Ecologically relevant thermal fluctuations enhance offspring fitness: biological and methodological implications for studies of thermal developmental plasticity,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Natural thermal environments are notably complex and challenging to mimic in controlled studies. Consequently, our understanding of the ecological relevance and underlying mechanisms of organismal responses to thermal environments is often limited. For example, studies of thermal developmental plasticity have provided key insights into the ecological consequences of temperature variation, but most laboratory studies use treatments that do not reflect natural thermal regimes. While controlling other important factors, we compared the effects of naturally fluctuating temperatures with those of commonly used laboratory regimes on development of lizard embryos and offspring phenotypes and survival. We incubated eggs in four treatments: three that followed procedures commonly used in the literature, and one that precisely mimicked naturally fluctuating nest temperatures. To explore context-dependent effects, we replicated these treatments across two seasonal regimes: relatively cool temperatures from nests constructed early in the season and warm temperatures from late-season nests. We show that natural thermal fluctuations have a relatively small effect on developmental variables but enhance hatchling performance and survival at cooler temperatures. Thus, natural thermal fluctuations are important for successful development and simpler approximations (e.g. repeated sine waves, constant temperatures) may poorly reflect natural systems under some conditions. Thus, the benefits of precisely replicating real-world temperatures in controlled studies may outweigh logistical costs. Although patterns might vary according to study system and research goals, our methodological approach demonstrates the importance of incorporating natural variation into controlled studies and provides biologists interested in thermal ecology with a framework for validating the effectiveness of commonly used methods.",,,,,"Hall, Joshua/AAP-7302-2020","Hall, Joshua/0000-0002-5587-3402",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,OCT,2020,223,19,,,,,,,jeb231902,10.1242/jeb.231902,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.231902,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000582938000024,View Full Record in Web of Science

For example, indirect bioprotection can operate via biotic influences on microclimate whereby physical decay processes associated with fluctuations in temperature and moisture (salt crystallization, thermal fatigue and wetting-drying), are limited. In the intertidal zone, the spatial and temporal distribution of macroalgae (seaweeds) is patchy, related to physical and ecological conditions for colonization and growth, and the nature and frequency of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. We examined the influence of seaweed canopies (Fucus spp.) on near-surface microclimate and, by implication, on conditions for mechanical rock decay and under-canopy ecology. Monitoring on hard artificial coastal structures in South West England, UK, built from limestone and concrete showed that both the range and maxima of daily summertime temperatures were significantly lower, by an average of 56% and 25%, respectively, in areas colonized by seaweed compared to experimentally cleared areas. Short-term microclimatic variability (minutes-hours) was also significantly reduced, by an average of 78% for temperature and 71% for humidity, under algal canopies during low-tide events. Using seaweed as an example, we develop a conceptual model of the relationship between biological cover and microclimate in the intertidal zone. Disturbance events that remove or drastically reduce seaweed cover mediate shifts between relatively stable and unstable states with respect to mechanical decay and ecological stress associated with heat and desiccation. In urban coastal environments where disturbance may be frequent, facilitating the establishment and recovery of canopy-forming species on rocks and engineered structures could enhance the durability of construction materials as well as support conservation, planning and policy targets for biodiversity enhancement.

We measured body temperature, metabolic rate and evaporative water loss, and calculated wet thermal conductance, for bats exposed to air temperatures ranging from 0 to 40degreesC for periods of 2-5h. Pregnant females maintained normothermic body temperatures (35.7+/-0.7degreesC; mean +/- S.E.M.) independent of air temperature. In contrast, males became torpid during the majority (68%) of exposures to air temperatures <25degreesC. The thermal neutral zone (TNZ) ranged between approximately 30degreesC and 34degreesC in both sexes and, within the TNZ, females had lower mass-specific metabolic rates (6.1+/-0.2 mW g(-1)) than males (9.0+/-0.9 mW g(-1)). Wet thermal conductance values in torpid bats (0.7+/-0.5 mW g(-1) deg.(-1)) were lower than those of normothermic individuals (1.1+/-0.3 mW g(-1) deg.(-1)). Mass-specific rates of evaporative water loss in males were consistently higher than in females at most air temperatures and rates of water loss in torpid bats were 63+/-6% of normothermic values. These results suggest that male and pregnant female L. cinereus employ different thermoregulatory strategies during their spring migration. Females defend normothermic body temperatures, presumably to expedite embryonic growth, while males use torpor, presumably to minimize energy and water deficits. These variable thermoregulatory strategies may reflect continental differences in the summer distribution of the sexes.",,,,,,"Cryan, Paul/0000-0002-2915-8894",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,OCT,2003,206,19,,,,,3381,3390,,10.1242/jeb.00574,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.00574,,,,,,,,12939370,,,,,WOS:000187393400016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Incubation and skeletal growth monitoring of juveniles of the scleractinian coral Acropora solitaryensis for 4 months from the planula stage, in seawater with mMg/Ca ratios of 5.2, 1.0, and 0.5, and temperatures of 19-28 degrees C, indicated that polymorphism of present-day scleractinian corals in low mMg/Ca seawater is also influenced by seawater temperature. However, corals produced more aragonite than formed in inorganic CaCO3 precipitation experiments under the same conditions, except at 19 degrees C. Although the aragonite content reflected the results of the latter (abiotic) experiments at 19 degrees C, it is suggested that aragonitic scleractinian corals controlled skeletal formation biologically under low mMg/Ca conditions at higher temperature, growth rates being faster at 25 degrees C and slower at 19 degrees C for all mMg/Ca ratios. Compared with growth rates under the present-day-equivalent seawater Mg/Ca level of 5.2, juvenile growth decreased by 62.8% +/- 14.7% and 56.7% +/- 6.7% under mMg/Ca levels of 1.0 and 0.5, respectively; the results suggest that growth of aragonitic scleractinian corals is suppressed throughout varying seasonal temperatures under low mMg/Ca conditions.

Comparison of AOZ and room temperature showed that during the first 10 days of the two experimental batches, AOZ temperature was lower and showed greater fluctuations than room temperature, most likely due to the switching of the heating system (on/off). Animals close to the sensor could disturb the AOZ measurement. This was not the case during colder nights, when animals moved away from the sensor and the measured AOZ temperature was a good indicator of the air temperature around the animals. The data for those periods were suitable,for use in this climate control study, but when applying the system in practice the disturbing effect needs to be prevented by better protection of the AOZ sensor For the second objective, the course of the AOZ temperature was modeled based on data for five nights when the heating switched on and off several times (goodness of fit R-t(2) = 0.77). One of the models was integrated in a simulated MBP controller that uses the model to predict future AOZ temperature; the controller switches the heating system on before the AOZ gets too cold and off before it gets too warm.

Larvae were exposed to high temperatures and low salinities for 24 hours, followed by feeding on the alga Isochrysis galbana in high or low salinity for another 10 minutes. Exposing Pisaster larvae to high temperatures and low salinities, followed by feeding in low salinity, did not impair ingestion rates. In fact, these larvae ingested particles at similar and sometimes higher rates than those in the controls. In sharp contrast, a 24-hour exposure to a high temperature and low salinity, followed by continued exposure to low salinity to feed, led to a decrease in the number of particles ingested by 8-arm Dendraster larvae. Larvae of both species captured very few particles when returned to 30 parts per thousand after a low-salinity event, indicating that continuous interruption of larval feeding by low-salinity events during development could be deleterious.

In addition to very high salinity (43-47g/I), other stressors such as large fluctuations in temperature exist that when combined with salinity can result in a severe physiological challenge to resident fishes. Fish kills during winter months are predominantly comprised of 'California' Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus x O. urolepis hornorum, so we investigated the effects of temperature and salinity interaction as a cause of the mortality. Tilapia acclimated to 43 g/I were transferred from 25 degrees C to 15 or 35 degrees C in order to assess the effect on osmoregulatory ability. There were significant increases in plasma osmolality and [Na+] 24 h after tilapia were transferred to 15 degrees C that recovered to pre-transfer values by 120 h. In order to demonstrate the additive effects of temperature and salinity, we transferred tilapia from 35 g/I salinity at 25 degrees C to 43 g/I salinity at 15,25, and 35 degrees C. The combined temperature and salinity challenge significantly affected plasma osmolality and branchial Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) activity, with fish in the 15 degrees C group experiencing mortality after 12 h. Branchial NKA activity was significantly increased 3 h following transfer, but was reduced by 6h in the 15 and 35 degrees C groups. The ability of this species to effectively osmoregulate as well as tolerate salinity transfer was impaired following a reduction in ambient temperature. Based on these experimental findings, we concluded that cold-induced tilapia mortality during winter months at the Salton Sea is due to osmoregulatory failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-1078,,,,,FAL,2007,93,4,,,,,200,213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000251775300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The trials were located at latitudes between 0.6 and 29.3 degrees and at altitudes from 780 to 2200 m asl. In those 13 trials where daily records of maximum and minimum temperature were available, mean preflowering temperatures for individual genotypes ranged from 17.9 to 24.6 degrees C and mean preflowering photoperiods varied from 12.7 to 14.7 h d(-1). The time from sowing to first flowering (f) for the 25 genotypes varied from 26 to 42 d in the most-inductive regime to as late as 47 to 80 d in the least-inductive circumstances. The stepwise linear regression on daily mean temperature during the pre-flowering period explained most (52-86%) of the variation in the rate of progress from sowing towards flowering of 21 genotypes. In contrast, in four genotypes (GLPx 92, Ikinimba, G 13671 and G 2816) the fitted values of days to flowering using temperature alone were much earlier than the times observed in the two trials at Maseru in Lesotho (the highest latitude and coolest location). These differences may well reflect photoperiodic effects but from the photothermal combinations encountered this could not be confirmed and so remains to be proven. The overall mean absolute difference between the observed and fitted time to flowering was just 2.6 d. The estimated optimum temperatures ranged from 20.4 to 23.3 degrees C, at which the minimum times taken to flower were between 28 and 44 d. The derived base and ceiling temperatures ranged from 7.1 to 13.2 degrees C and from 29.1 to 40.2 degrees C respectively. Not surprisingly, the use of long-term monthly temperatures (for those trials from which daily temperature records were not available) gave poor agreement between predicted and observed flowering times.

J,"Temple, GK; Johnston, IA",,,,"Temple, GK; Johnston, IA",,,Testing hypotheses concerning the phenotypic plasticity of escape performance in fish of the family Cottidae,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"A knowledge of the natural history of two species of marine Cottidae was used to construct a set of complex a priori hypotheses to test the idea that seasonal temperature acclimation conferred a fitness advantage and to examine whether acclimation responses were constant through development. The species studied were the short-horn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius L.) and the long-spined sea scorpion (Tartulus bubalis Euphr.). Fast-start escape performance was measured as a proxy of fitness, and maximum body-length-specific speed ((U) over cap(max)) acceleration ((A) over cap(max)), and angular velocity (<(omega)over cap>(max)) cumulative turning angle (CTA) were quantified. Fish were acclimated to 5, 15 and 20 degrees C and filmed using high-speed cinematography at 0.8, 5.0, 15.0 and 20.0 degrees C. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) improvements in escape performance following acclimation to high temperature in adult short-horn sculpin that live offshore would involve a trade-off in performance at low temperature, (2) the escape response of the sea scorpion, which experiences large daily temperature variation, would exhibit low thermal sensitivity and be unchanged by acclimation between 5 and 15 degrees C, and (3) in short-horn sculpin, the ability to acclimate maximum speed thermally is acquired during ontogeny in parallel with the offshore migration of the late juvenile stage. At 20.0 degrees C, in adult short-horn sculpin, (U) over cap(max) (A) over cap(max) were 110% and 55% higher, respectively, in 15 degrees C than in 5 degrees C-acclimated fish. No evidence was obtained for improved fast-start performance at 0.8 degrees C or 5.0 degrees C following cold acclimation. In the long-spined sea scorpion, acclimation to 5 and 15 degrees C did not improve (U) over cap(max) or (A) over cap(max) compared with fish acutely exposed to these temperatures, although acclimation to 5 degrees C increased omega(max) (P=0.005). When tested over the most extreme thermal range found in the field, all variables were improved at a test temperature of 0.8 degrees C in 5 degrees C-compared with 15 degrees C-acclimated sea scorpion. Acclimation therefore appeared to be beneficial in some instances in both species. How this affects relative fitness is uncertain. The scaling of (U) over cap(max) with acclimation to 5 and 15 degrees C was examined in both species over the test range 5.0-15.0 degrees C. Temperature acclimation did not affect scaling relationships of (U) over cap(max) in long-spined sea scorpion ranging in total body length (L) from 45 to 160 mm. At a test temperature of 15.0 degrees C, the scaling of (U) over cap(max) for shorthorn sculpin ranging in total body length from 43 to 270 mm changed from aL(-0.98) in 5 degrees C-acclimated fish to aL(-0.50) (where a is the proportionality coefficient in the regression equation) in 15 degrees C-acclimated fish (P<0.01). In short-horn sculpin, therefore, the ability to modify escape performance with temperature acclimation was found to vary during ontogeny, potentially paralleling a migration from a more variable to a more stable thermal environment.",,,,,"Johnston, Ian A./AAE-2044-2019; Johnston, Ian A/D-6592-2013","Johnston, Ian A/0000-0002-7796-5754",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,FEB,1998,201,3,,,,,317,331,,,,,,,,,,,9427667,,,,,WOS:000072287600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seed of a fourth line of burr medic, a naturalised line, was harvested from Hermitage Research Station at that time. Pods were placed on the soil surface and buried at a depth of 7 cm, both in flywire envelopes and as free pods. Residual hard seed numbers were determined each year for 3 years from the envelopes, and seedlings were counted and removed from the free pods after each germination event. Patterns of softening of seeds from the same seed populations were also determined after placing them in a laboratory oven with a diurnal temperature fluctuation of 60/15 degrees C for periods of 16, 40 and 64 weeks followed, after each time period, by 4 diurnal cycles of 35/10 degrees C. More than 90% of the original seeds were hard. Seed softening at the soil surface ranged from 26% after 3 years in button medic to almost complete softening in the gama medic after only 2 years. Burial had little effect on the rate of softening of the button medic but about halved the rate of softening of the other lines. The barrel medics were vulnerable to losses of large numbers of seedlings which softened and germinated in January-February and the snail medics from seedlings emerging in August-December. The proportion of soft seeds recovered as seedlings in the buried compared with the surface pods was higher in the larger-seeded medics, snail and gama, and lower in the other, smaller-seeded medics. Laboratory techniques effectively ranked the medic lines for their rate of seed softening in the field and provided some insight into their seasonal patterns of seed softening. A wide range of seed softening patterns is available for fitting the requirements of various farming systems. The most appropriate pattern of softening will depend on the variability of medic seed production between years and the need for self regeneration of the medic after a cereal crop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0816-1089,,,,,,1997,37,7,,,,,767,778,,10.1071/EA97060,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA97060,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000071707000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about the variation in cold tolerance of marine invertebrates among local populations of the same species. In this study, three experiments were conducted to demonstrate inter-population variation in the cold tolerance of the intertidal gastropod Littorina brevicula, and to explore factors driving the variation. First, seasonal changes in the freezing temperature (the supercooling point, SCP) and the median lower lethal temperature (LLT50) of snails collected from a single population were examined to identify the cold tolerance strategies of this species. Seasonal fluctuation was clear in only the LLT50 which was lower than the SCP in winter, indicating that cold tolerance strategy of this species was freeze tolerant. Second, the cold tolerance of snails from four populations was compared. These populations were distributed at latitudinally different locations, and the comparisons were performed before winter when their cold tolerance was not required and in winter when their cold tolerance increased. In this experiment, while the cold tolerance of snails collected in winter was higher than that of snails collected before winter in all four populations, there were differences in tolerance among the populations. Furthermore, to estimate their ability of acclimation to cold environments, snails that were collected from the northernmost and southernmost populations in the four populations before winter were acclimated to a constant low temperature in the laboratory for a long period (120-130 days). This long period of acclimation led to an increase in the cold tolerance of both populations, but the latitudinal difference was maintained. Additionally, after imposing the long period of acclimation to snails that were collected at 12 locations before winter, factors that might cause local variation in their cold tolerance were explored. This experiment clearly showed that local variation in cold tolerance was explained by the lowest local air temperature. Our study demonstrated inter population variation in the cold tolerance of an intertidal mollusc, and that the variation is explained by thermal gradients in winter. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In eastern Canada, hemlock looper (HL) Lambdina fiscellaria (Guene) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) females generally oviposit in September, with eggs entering an obligatory diapause quickly after their deposition. We therefore simulated an early start of the HL reproduction cycle of 2, 4, 6, or 8 weeks to examine the extent to which freshly laid eggs from two populations (island and mainland) can withstand exposure to four temperature conditions (15, 20, 25 degrees C, or fluctuating temperature in an outdoor insectary), with all treatments ending on 1 September 2007. On this date, half the eggs from each population were immediately incubated at 15 degrees C, while the rest were stored in an outdoor insectary until their incubation at 15 degrees C the following spring. In a separate experiment, the effect of temperature on pre-diapause duration was determined from the number of days required for eggs to change colour after oviposition. The pre-diapause phase was completed faster as temperature increased. Regardless of incubation date and population, percent hatch decreased significantly after 6-8 weeks of exposure to 25 degrees C or in the outdoor insectary. Under most treatments, the odds of dying as pharate larvae increased with exposure duration. When eggs were incubated at 15 degrees C immediately after treatment, time to hatch and diapause duration remained constant over treatments, except at 25 degrees C when they both decreased. After 8 weeks of exposure to 15 or 20 degrees C, eggs transferred outdoors were more likely to hatch precociously than those exposed to 25 degrees C or insectary conditions. Globally, mortality seemed greater among eggs stored outdoors than among those kept indoors. Most eggs that survived the winter hatched synchronously after incubation in spring.

The fragments were acclimatized at 27 degrees C during eight days and then exposed to thermal shock at two temperatures (28.5 degrees C and 30.5 degrees C) for 72 h. The stress response was evaluated quantifying the total lipid content, symbiont density, and tissue damage. Changes in the evaluated estimators were evident at 30.5 degrees C when an initial increase in the amount of lipids was detected, followed by a decrease after 30 h; symbiont density diminished up to 84% at the end of the experiment relative to the initial density estimated. The control and 28.5 degrees C treatments presented no differences. Damage to the polyp tissue was mainly observed as a thinning of the mesenteries and the gastrodermal layer.

Results indicated that tomato subjected to high TF (15 +/- 5 degrees C) had higher respiration rate and weightlessness rate, earlier ethylene release peak, and developed rapid color transfer greater than that to 15 +/- 0 degrees C. Besides, tomato exposed to high TF (15 +/- 5 degrees C) reveal low lycopene, total phenols, and ascorbic acid content, and inferior activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase later in the storage period. Indicated in this study is the fact that a consistent storage temperature (15 +/- 0 degrees C) helps to delay ripening and the senescence process of mature green tomato, and a good sensory quality and high antioxidant capacity after storage is maintained. Practical applications Storage temperature fluctuation in cold chain logistics of fresh fruits and vegetables is one of the main factors leading to quality loss. In this experiment, the effects of different temperature fluctuations on ripening quality and antioxidant properties of mature green tomato were evaluated. The results showed that the high TF would lead to the abnormal ripening of tomatoes and reduce the ripening quality and antioxidant capacity, while the constant storage temperature had the opposite effect. Operators should ensure as far as possible that the temperature of any link in the cold chain logistics of fresh food is stable, so as to extend the full-ripening time of green mature tomato after harvest, and improve their edible quality and antioxidant capacity.",,,,,,", Yanfang/0000-0002-8987-7110; Chen, Lan/0000-0003-3736-4636",,,,,,,,,,,,,0145-8892,1745-4549,,,,NOV,2020,44,11,,,,,,,e14831,10.1111/jfpp.14831,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.14831,,SEP 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000571850800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Average mean, low, and high values in 2-wk periods throughout the year were 22.5,14.9, and 28.5 degrees C for Ta and 61.0, 49.6. and 68.5% for RH, respectively. Animal measurements occurred monthly from December, 2006 through October, 2007. Animals were fed alfalfa hay to meet the maintenance energy requirement. Because BW was relatively constant throughout the experiment, EE was considered equal to metabolizable energy (ME) intake. In January, April, July, and October, the day of measuring heart rate (HR) occurred within a 7-day period when bucks were housed in metabolism crates for total collection of feces and urine. Individual EE to HR ratio was estimated at those times and used to predict EE throughout the year based on HP, EE in kJ/kg BW0.75 was greater for Shami than for Balady goats in January, July. and October (P<0.05), for Balady ranked (P<0.05) July and October<January and April, and for Shami ranked (P<0.05) January, April, and July>October. EE:HR was greatest among times (P<0.05) in April and greater (P<0.05) for Shami vs. Balady. Digestibilities of DM and energy were slightly greater for Shami than for Balady (P<0.05). For monthly measures, rectal temperature, blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and HR were similar between breeds. HR differed among months, with means ranging from 57.0 to 77.6 bpm. There were large differences among months in the difference between EE at particular measurement daily times and the average (EEdiff). No climate measure in the preceding 2 or 4 wk was correlated with EE or EEdiff (P>0.10). The same was true for correlations based on all data of EEdiff and the full-day measurement of climate conditions in the month preceding HR measurement. However, when correlations were conducted separately for each genotype, some relationships for Balady goats were significant while those for Shami goats were nonsignificant. A regression of EEdiff of Balady goats against mean Ta and THI on the preceding HR measurement day revealed a coefficient of 4.17 or 2.78 kJ/kg BW0.75 per 1 degrees C or THI unit, respectively. In conclusion, EE of Balady goats appears sensitive to climate conditions, whereas that of Shami goats is not or at least is relatively less impacted. With hot conditions, Balady goats have an advantage in a decreased ME requirement for maintenance and with low Ta, Balady goats have an increased requirement. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis focuses on the signature of the ocean large-scale climate fluctuations driven by the atmospheric forcing and do not address the mesoscale variability. We use the ECCO version 4 ocean reanalysis to unravel the role of ocean transport and surface buoyancy fluxes in the observed SSH, SST and OC variability. We show that the SSH regional variability is dominated by the steric effect (except at high latitude) and is mainly shaped by ocean heat transport divergences with some contributions from the surface heat fluxes forcing that can be significant regionally (confirming earlier results). This is in contrast with the SST regional variability, which is the result of the compensation of surface heat fluxes by ocean heat transport in the mixed layer and arises from small departures around this background balance. Bringing together the results of SSH and SST analyses, we show that SSH and SST bear some common variability. This is because both SSH and SST variability show significant contributions from the surface heat fluxes forcing. It is evidenced by the high correlation between SST and buoyancy-forced SSH almost everywhere in the ocean except at high latitude. OC, which is determined by phytoplankton biomass, is governed by the availability of light and nutrients that essentially depend on climate fluctuations. For this reason, OC shows significant correlation with SST and SSH. We show that the correlation with SST displays the same pattern as the correlation with SSH with a negative correlation in the tropics and subtropics and a positive correlation at high latitude. We discuss the reasons for this pattern.",,,,,"Racault, Marie-Fanny/D-7190-2016; Meyssignac, Benoit/GLQ-5451-2022","Racault, Marie-Fanny/0000-0002-7584-2515; Meyssignac, Benoit/0000-0001-6325-9843; Brewin, Robert/0000-0001-5134-8291",,,,,,,,,,,,,0169-3298,1573-0956,,,,JAN,2017,38,1,,,SI,,187,215,,10.1007/s10712-016-9383-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10712-016-9383-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000395073100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our laboratory experiments demonstrated that Chinook salmon can readily survive and grow at temperatures up to 24degreesC. However, juveniles reared at 21-24degreesC experienced significantly decreased growth rates, impaired smoltification indices, and increased predation vulnerability compared with juveniles reared at 13-16degreesC. Fish reared at 17-20degreesC experienced similar growth, variable smoltification impairment, and higher predation vulnerability compared with fish reared at 13-16degreesC.

Yet, through anthropogenic alteration many large river systems have become simplified through the construction of levees and dams that reduce lateral connectivity and flow variability. The extent to which shifts in habitat mosaics create conditions that support different trophic responses that manifest in differences in fish growth across the landscape remains largely untested. This is primarily due to limitations in linking habitat features, dynamic physical processes, and trophic transfer of energy to higher taxa at the landscape scale. Here, we conducted large-scale enclosure experiments across varying habitats on a fluvial floodplain as a model system to measure factors that influence habitat-specific growth rates in multiple Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) stocks important to fisheries and of conservation concern. Using an ecosystem approach, we reveal that landscape context, water residence time, and habitat type (agricultural, wetland, river channel) result in different hot-spots of primary and secondary food production. This variation in the aquatic foodscape resulted in significant variation in salmon growth rates and ultimate size and morphology across the landscape. Floodplain habitats generally exhibited higher water residence times as highlighted by higher specific conductance, salinity, and chlorophyll-a values. Pelagic invertebrate abundance was 10 to 100 times more abundant in the off-channel habitats compared to the river channels. The average daily growth rates of the juvenile Chinook Salmon ranged from 0.15 mm day(-1) and 0.01 g day(-1) in the riverine habitat to 0.55 mm day(-1) and 0.07 g day(-1) in the off-channel habitat. These data were used to build mixed effects models that showed the influence of chlorophyll-a concentration, water temperature and pelagic invertebrate composition on fish growth across locations throughout the experiment. As landscapes become increasingly simplified there is increased risk of losing the mosaic of habitats necessary to achieve enhanced fish growth and phenotypically diverse and sustainable salmon populations. This in-situ experimental and modeling approach can be applied to other systems to develop ecosystem indicators such as habitat-specific fish growth rates to manage landscapes and processes to support resilient fish populations.",,,,,"Cordoleani, Flora/AGO-5247-2022","Cordoleani, Flora/0000-0002-6017-2678",,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,MAR,2022,136,,,,,,,,108681,10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108681,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.108681,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000761403500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In response to these changes, some species have been adversely impacted while others have benefited. One species that has benefited from climate change, historically and in response to experimental treatments, is common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), a widely distributed annual weed and a leading cause of hay fever in North America. To better understand how climate change may affect the distribution of common ragweed, we built a maximum entropy (Maxent) predictive model using climate and bioclimatic data and over 700 observations across the eastern U.S. Our model performed well with an AUC score of 0.765 using four uncorrelated variables, including precipitation seasonality, mean diurnal temperature range, August precipitation, and January maximum temperature. After building and testing our model, we then projected potential future common ragweed distribution using a suite of 13 global climate models (GCMs) under two future greenhouse gas scenarios for mid and late-century. In addition to providing georeferenced hot spots of potential future expansion, we also provide a metric of confidence by evaluating the number of GCMs that agree. We show a substantial contraction of common ragweed in central Florida, southern Appalachian Mountains, and northeastern Virginia and areas of potential expansion at the northern margins of its current distribution, notably in northeastern U.S. However, the vast majority of this increase is projected to occur by mid-century and may be moderated somewhat by the 2070s, implying that common ragweed may be sensitive to climatic variability. Although other factors and modeling approaches should be explored, we offer preliminary insight into where common ragweed might be a new concern in the future. Due to the health impacts of ragweed, local weed control boards may be well advised to monitor areas of expansion and potentially increase eradication efforts.",,,,,,"Case, Michael/0000-0003-4111-2298",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,OCT 31,2018,13,10,,,,,,,e0205677,10.1371/journal.pone.0205677,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205677,,,,,,,,30379857,,,,,WOS:000448823700062,View Full Record in Web of Science

The temperature-humidity index (THI) differed significantly between all stationary loggers. The lowest THI was measured at the window logger in the experimental stall and the highest THI was measured at the central logger in the experimental stall. The THI at the mobile cow loggers was 233 THI points higher than at the stationary loggers. Furthermore, the mean daily THI was higher at the mobile cow loggers than at the stationary loggers on all experimental days. The THI in the experimental pen was 044 THI points lower when the experimental cow group was located inside the milking parlour. The THI measured at the mobile cow loggers was 163 THI points higher when the experimental cow group was located inside the milking parlour. However, there was no significant difference for all climate variables between primiparous and multiparous cows. These results indicate, there is a wide range of climate conditions inside a dairy barn and especially areas with a great distance to a fresh air supply have an increased risk for the occurrence of heat stress conditions. Furthermore, the heat stress conditions are even higher at cow level and cows not only influence their climatic environment, but also generate microclimates within different locations inside the barn.

However, the phenoloxidase cascade also plays a significant role in insect immunity, leading to the additional hypothesis that the thermal environment indirectly shapes immune function via direct selection on cuticle color. Support for the latter hypothesis comes from the cricket Allonemobius socius, where cuticle darkness and immune-related phenoloxidase activity increase with latitude. However, thermal environments vary seasonally as well as geographically, suggesting that seasonal plasticity in immunity may also exist. Although seasonal fluctuations in vertebrate immune function are common (because of flux in breeding or resource abundance), seasonality in invertebrate immunity has not been widely explored. We addressed this possibility by rearing crickets in simulated summer and fall environments and assayed their cuticle color and immune function. Prior to estimating immunity, crickets were placed in a common environment to minimize metabolic rate differences. Individuals reared under fall-like conditions exhibited darker cuticles, greater phenoloxidase activity and greater resistance to the bacteria Serratia marcescens. These data support the hypothesis that changes in the thermal environment modify cuticle color, which indirectly shapes immune investment through pleiotropy. This hypothesis may represent a widespread mechanism governing immunity in numerous systems, considering that most insects operate in seasonally and geographically variable thermal environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,NOV,2013,216,21,,,,,4005,4010,,10.1242/jeb.091538,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.091538,,,,,,,,23868839,,,,,WOS:000325806300016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Those process parameters were filter media types (Type A Biofill (R), BactoBalls (R) and MECHpro (R) rings), temperatures (24.3 degrees C, 19.0 degrees C, 15.3 degrees C) and production of TAN (1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 g per day) while other process parameters values remained constant. TAN production was simulated with the addition of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) in the recirculation system. Constant measuring of the total ammonia nitrogen concentration in the biofilter effluent was required to perform a model of N-TAN fluctuation based on a specific feeding regime and to ascertain performance differences between biofilters. At the end of the experiment, notable differences were observed in the ammonia removal rates depending on different process parameters.

Scleractinian corals are detrimentally affected by thermal fluctuations, which often lead to an uncoupling of their mutualism with Symbiodinium spp. (coral bleaching) and potentially coral death. Consequently, on many Caribbean reefs scleractinian coral cover has plummeted. Conversely, gorgonian corals persist, with their abundance even increasing. How gorgonians react to thermal anomalies has been investigated utilizing limited parameters of either the gorgonian, Symbiodinium or the combined symbiosis (holobiont). We employed a holistic approach to examine the effect of an experimental five-day elevated temperature episode on parameters of the host, symbiont, and the holobiont in Eunicea tourneforti, E. flexuosa and Pseudoplexaura porosa. These gorgonian corals reacted and coped with 32 degrees C seawater temperatures. Neither Symbiodinium genotypes nor densities differed between the ambient 29.5 degrees C and 32 degrees C. Chlorophyll a and c(2) per Symbiodinium cell, however, were lower at 32 degrees C leading to a reduction in chlorophyll content in the branches and an associated reduction in estimated absorbance and increase in the chlorophyll a specific absorption coefficient. The adjustments in the photochemical parameters led to changes in photochemical efficiencies, although these too showed that the gorgonians were coping. For example, the maximum excitation pressure, Q(m), was significantly lower at 32 degrees C than at 29.5 degrees C. In addition, although per dry weight the amount of protein and lipids were lower at 32 degrees C, the overall energy content in the tissues did not differ between the temperatures. Antioxidant activity either remained the same or increased following exposure to 32 degrees C further reiterating a response that dealt with the stressor. Taken together, the capability of Caribbean gorgonian corals to modify symbiont, host and consequently holobiont parameters may partially explain their persistence on reefs faced with climate change.",,,,,,"Ramsby, Blake/0000-0001-9961-945X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,FEB 2,2017,12,2,,,,,,,e0171032,10.1371/journal.pone.0171032,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171032,,,,,,,,28152002,,,,,WOS:000396161200076,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few seagrass experiments have examined whether exposure to multiple stressors causes antagonistic, additive, or synergistic effects, and this has limited our ability to predict the future health status of seagrass beds. We conducted a laboratory experiment to test whether abundance of Gracilaria comosa (3 levels; 0, 1.2, and 3.4 kg WW m(-2)), an algae that is resistant to wide environmental fluctuations (e.g. light, temperature, salinity, and oxygen levels), has negative effects on the small ephemeral seagrass, Halophila ovalis and whether the effects are exacerbated by high temperature (3 levels; 20, 25, and 30A degrees C). We found an additive negative effect of the two stressors when tested simultaneously on 14 seagrass performance measures, with most data variability explained by the drift algae. For the individual plant performance measures (above- and below-ground growth and mortality, leaf area, internode distance, and root length and root volume), we found 5 additive effects, 4 synergistic effects, and 5 effects that were significant only for drift algae. We also documented a significant additive effect of drift algae and temperature on dissolved porewater sulphide (DS). A follow-up correlation analysis between DS and the 14 plant performance measures revealed significant or near-significant linear correlations on 9 of these responses (above- and below-ground growth, leaf area and weight, leaf mortality, and internode distance). In summary, we showed (a) that a stress-resistant drift algae can have strong negative effects on a small ephemeral seagrass, (b) this negative effect can increase both additively and synergistically with increasing temperature depending on performance measure, and (c) the negative effects may be mediated by a build-up of porewater DS.

We located 31 nests, distributed from head-of-tide to the lowermost dam; no spawners or nests were observed in the tidally influenced zone or upstream of this dam. Mean longevity in the stream and the number of nests attended were correlated with arrival date; early migrants were alive longer and attended more nests than later migrants. Males were more likely to be observed away from a nest, or attending three or more nests, than were females, which attended usually one or two nests.

Results: For validation, we compared our model's predictions with the results of several experimental studies. We showed that the model gives reliable predictions of growth, nutrient utilization (including amino acid retention), and body composition over a timespan of several months, longer than most of the previously developed predictive models.

Among four diel different fluctuation amplitudes of +/- 1, +/- 2, +/- 3 and +/- 4 degrees C, the growth rate of shrimp at 25 +/- 2, 25 +/- 3, 28 +/- 2 and 31 +/- 1 degrees C were significantly higher than those at corresponding constant temperatures of 25, 28 and 31 degrees C, respectively, while growth rate at 31 +/- 4 degrees C was significantly lower than at 31 C degrees. There is a trend that the optimal thermal amplitude for shrimp growth decreased with the increase of average temperature in the present study. The growth rate of Chinese shrimp was a quadratic function of the thermal amplitude at the same average temperature. Such a growth model may be described by G = beta(0) + beta(1) (TA) + beta(2) (TA)(2) where G represents the specific growth rate on a 33-day basis, TA is thermal amplitude in degree Celsius, beta(0) is intercept on G axis, and beta(1) and beta(2) are the regression coefficients. The optimal thermal amplitude for the growth of shrimp at sizes of this experiment at average temperature of 25, 28 and 31 T was estimated to be 2.0, 2.2 and 1.4 degrees C, respectively. The changes of food conversion efficiency were similar to the growth rate, while the trends of food consumption of shrimp between fluctuating temperature and constant temperature were variable at different average temperatures. There was no significant difference in apparent digestibility coefficient between diel fluctuating temperatures and corresponding constant temperatures. Therefore, more food consumption, high food conversion efficiency and more energy partitioned into growth might account for the enhancement in the growth of shrimp at the diel fluctuating temperatures in the present study.

Larger eggs enhance offspring traits, but as a tradeoff, laying large eggs also infers energetic costs to the female. Income breeders usually lay larger eggs later in the season, when temperatures and food availability are higher. Egg size is thus affected by the daily amount of energy available to produce an egg under cold conditions, but it is less well known in how far temperature exerts direct effects on egg size. We show that great tit females Parus major with access to ad libitum food and breeding in climate-controlled aviaries varied their egg investments. The size of an individual egg was best predicted by mean temperatures one week pre-laying, with females laying larger, rather than smaller, eggs under colder conditions. Eggs increased in size over the season, but not significantly over the laying sequence. The degree of daily temperature fluctuation did not influence egg size. In addition to a substantial between-female variation, sisters were more similar to each other than unrelated females, showing that egg size does also reflect heritable intrinsic female properties. Natural variation in egg size is thus not only determined by energy-limitation, but also due to females allocating more resources to eggs laid in colder environments, thus increasing early survival of the chicks. That the positive correlation between temperature and egg investments that is found in a natural population is reversed under ad libitum food conditions demonstrates that wild great tits tradeoff own condition with survival prospects of their chicks as a function of available food, not ambient temperature.",,,,,"Visser, Marcel E/A-9151-2009; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Visser, Marcel E/0000-0002-1456-1939; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0908-8857,,,,,JUN,2013,44,3,,,,,245,254,,10.1111/j.1600-048X.2012.00129.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2012.00129.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000318811100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Self-propelled bacteria swimming in this viscoelastic medium induce director deformations which can strongly influence their velocity, and we study the temperature behavior of their motility in the whole range of the nematic phase. We observe experimentally that, with increasing temperature, while the viscosity drops exponentially and the frequency of the flagellum rotation grows linearly, the swimmers' speed first conventionally increases but then, above some crossover temperature, slows down and at the same time bacteria-induced director distortions become visible. It is shown that the physics behind this temperature-driven effect is in a sharp rise in the ability of the bacterium's flagellum to induce director deformations. As temperature increases, the splay and bend elastic constants sharply decrease and the anchoring extrapolation length of the flagellum surface gets shorter and shorter. At the crossover temperature the resulting effective anchoring effect dominates the fast dropping viscosity and the distortion strengthens. As a result, a fraction of the torque the flagellum applies for the propulsion is spent for the elastic degrees of freedom, which results in a bacterium slowdown. To find the director distortions, the flagellum is presented as a collection of anchoring-induced elastic monopoles, and the bacterium velocity is found from the balance of the energy spent for the propulsion and the viscous drag and nematodynamic dissipation.",,,,,"; Buluy, Oleksandr/Y-9555-2018","Skivka, Larysa/0000-0002-2171-1085; Faidiuk, Yuliia/0000-0003-2982-3919; Buluy, Oleksandr/0000-0001-9470-0662",,,,,,,,,,,,,2470-0045,2470-0053,,,,NOV 5,2021,104,5,,,,,,,54603,10.1103/PhysRevE.104.054603,http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.104.054603,,,,,,,,34942701,,,,,WOS:000718893500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We subjected individuals to either a single prolonged three hour heating event, or three one hour heating events with a recovery time of 24 h between bouts. Aphids exposed to repeated bouts of high temperatures had more glucose and higher expression of proteins and osmolyte compounds, such as glycerol, compared to the prolonged exposure group. However, aphids exposed to the repeated high temperature treatment had reduced sources of energy such as trehalose and triglyceride compounds than the prolonged exposure group. Recovery time had more physiological costs (based on production of more protein and consumption of more trehalose and triglyceride) and benefits (based on production of more osmolytes) in repeated high temperature treatments. As aphids are known to respond differently to constant versus 'natural' fluctuating temperature regimes, conclusions drawn from constant temperature data sets may be problematic.

However, in the field, corals live in dynamic environments, which can be subjected to multiple types of stressors that can not be mimicked in the laboratory. Furthermore, the temporal scales over which many environmental conditions can vary in the reef, such as extreme temperature anomalies, tidal fluctuations, and point source pollution events are far shorter than most field estimates of coral growth, which are generally at annual or seasonal scales. To measure the impact to coral growth of environmental variables that vary on time scales of less than a year or a few months requires developing new growth measurement techniques. With the goal of measuring coral growth at sub-weekly scales in the field, we developed a technique to measure 5-day linear extension growth rates. We tested our approach on colonies of Acropora hyacinthus living in a shallow back-reef ecosystem with routine extreme daily fluctuations in temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen saturation. Using serial skeletal staining and petrographic thin sectioning we measured linear extension in A. hyacinthus during three consecutive 5-day growth periods that had differing amounts of environmental variability. At our field site in American Samoa, the second growth period had the largest tidal swings, resulting in higher variability: within a day temperature ranged up to 5.4 degrees C (reaching a maximum of 31.9 degrees C) and pH ranged up to 0.41 units (with a minimum of pH 7.78). We tested whether corals are able to maintain even linear extension rates across these short periods of time or not. After confocal microscopy analysis of stained skeletal samples we found that linear extension rates were similar across the three growth periods.

To assess changes in the gas-phase O-2 concentration in a pecan orchard soil in response to flood irrigations throughout a growing season, two types of O-2 sensor were field tested: a galvanic O-2 sensor and a spectometer-coupled chemical sensor (FOXY sensor). Galvanic sensors, housed in diffusion chambers, were buried at four depths and a datalogger recorded continuous voltage output. The FOXY O-2 sensor was utilized as part of a mobile O-2 detection system to field analyze gas samples withdrawn periodically from buried diffusion chambers. The FOXY sensor was found to be unstable, however, and difficult to calibrate under conditions of changing temperature and humidity. Laboratory experiments simulating submersion of the galvanic sensor indicated that voltage outputs were comparable to the range observed in the field, but the absence of diurnal concentration fluctuations, typically found in soil measurements, provided a way to discriminate between normal and aberrant output. The responsiveness of the galvanic sensor and its capability to continuously gather hourly data makes it superior to methods dependent on manual sample collection. Galvanic sensors were adequately suited for long-term in situ use in agricultural soil when housed in appropriate diffusion chambers. Higher costs, limited access to diffusion chambers during flood periods, and high variability associated with manually collected data make the FOXY mobile O-2 detection system comparatively less optimal for use in agricultural settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0361-5995,1435-0661,,,,MAY-JUN,2008,72,3,,,,,758,766,,10.2136/sssaj2007.0170,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2007.0170,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000255900300022,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Rognstad, RL; Hilbish, TJ",,,,"Rognstad, Rhiannon L.; Hilbish, Thomas J.",,,Temperature-induced variation in the survival of brooded embryos drives patterns of recruitment and abundance in Semibalanus balanoides,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Geographic distributions of species are frequently influenced by temperature and as a result, there is considerable interest in predicting the effect of climate change on biogeography. Previous studies have found strong correlations between sea surface temperature and recruitment in the acorn barnacle Semibalanus balanoides, an important member of temperate intertidal communities in the Northern Hemisphere. The underlying mechanism that drives this relationship is, however, unknown. The hypothesis tested here is that variation in recruitment is determined by temperature-induced variation in survival of brooded embryos. Brooding adults were held under several environmentally-relevant temperature conditions from 7 degrees C to 13 degrees C until eggs were ready to hatch. There was no significant effect of temperature on embryonic development rate. Brooding individuals held at colder temperatures had more than twice the reproductive mass of those held at warmer temperatures. This mass difference is caused by an over three-fold larger number of embryos surviving in the coldest treatment (7 degrees C) compared to the warmest treatment (13 degrees C). Temperature-induced variation in number of surviving embryos likely contributes to differences in recruitment following cold winters vs. warm winters. Such temperature-dependent variation in recruitment has been shown to cause year to year fluctuations in the positions of the geographic limits of the species in Southwest England, France, and Spain. This study illustrates the key role of adult input into the larval pool in generating variation in recruitment and its influence on biogeography. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In the first, seeds of four Juncus species, Alopecurus aequalis, and Carex nebrascensis were stored overwinter at 3-4 degrees C either dry or wet. In spring, these groups were further divided into four constant temperature treatments (15, 20, 25, or 30 degrees C) and 3 fluctuating temperature treatments (low, moderate, high). In the second experiment, the duration of cold-wet storage, photoperiod, and temperature were further evaluated. In the first experiment, cold-wet seed storage led to higher and faster germination for all but C nebrascensis; Fluctuating temperatures produced the highest germination of A. aequalis, C. nebrascensis, Juncus tenuis, and J. ensifolius. In Experiment 2, seed storage time effects varied with species. Photoperiod effects (12v. 14h light) were generally insignificant. Diel temperature fluctuations of 15-27 degrees C produced higher seed germination than 32-38 degrees C for all four Juncus species. The highest germination percentages of J. balticus (64-69%) and J. ensifolius (61-73%) occurred after at least 2 months of cold-wet storage and incubation at 15-27 C, whereas J. tenuis and J. torreyi had 51-58% germination both at the start of the study and after a year of wet vernalization. The conditions for germination of the species studied still needs further optimization, but the effects of temperature, temperature fluctuation, overwinter storage conditions, as well as the days to germinate at a given temperature, have been at least partly elucidated for the species studied.

A model developed over 20 years ago has been used to estimate daily food intake in brown trout living in streams and lakes over a wide geographical range. The chief disadvantages of this early model are that it is not continuous and requires twelve parameters, not all of which can be interpreted biologically. A new model, using a larger data set, was therefore developed to overcome these problems and estimate the mean daily energy intake. 2. The two data sets used to develop the original model were also used to develop the general form of the new one, but a third data set was used to specify the model more precisely and to estimate the parameters. This third data set originated from experiments in which 185 trout (live weight range 1-350 g) were kept individually at 19 constant temperatures (range 3.8-21.7 degrees C) usually for 5-6 weeks. They were fed freshly killed shrimps (Gammarus pulex) and their food consumption was recorded throughout each experiment. 3. Five, six and eight parameter versions of the new model were all excellent fits to the data (P < 0.001, R-2 > 0.99), with the eight parameter version being slightly the best. All parameters can be interpreted in biological terms; three define threshold temperatures, three define the curvilinear slopes in the model over different temperature ranges, one is a weight exponent and one is the maximum daily energy intake of a 1g trout. The simpler six parameter model was adequate at temperatures above 7 degrees C. 4, An additional experiment with twenty-eight trout feeding on six different invertebrate foods provided estimates of energy intake that were very similar to those predicted from the model. However, when daily intake was converted to dry weight, agreement with values from the model (also as dry weight) was poor. Possible reasons for this are discussed, as are other studies using the earlier model, and it is shown that different conclusions can be reached depending upon whether comparisons are based on units of energy, dry weight or wet weight.",,,,,"Hurley, Margaret A/A-8875-2013","Hurley, Margaret A/0000-0002-2502-432X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,MAR,1998,39,2,,,,,339,349,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00288.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00288.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000072885600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Oviparous, non-avian reptiles have received considerable attention because eggs are left to develop under prevailing conditions, leaving developing embryos vulnerable to increases in temperature. Though many studies assess embryo responses to long-term (i.e., chronic), constant incubation temperatures, few assess responses to acute exposures which are more relevant for many species. We subjected brown anole (Anolis sagrei) eggs to heat shocks, thermal ramps, and extreme diurnal fluctuations to determine the lethal temperature of embryos, measure the thermal sensitivity of embryo heart rate and metabolism, and quantify the effects of sublethal but stressful temperatures on development and hatchling phenotypes and survival. Most embryos died at heat shocks of 45 degrees C or 46 degrees C, which is ~12 degrees C warmer than the highest constant temperatures suitable for successful development. Heart rate and O-2 consumption increased with temperature; however, as embryos approached the lethal temperature, heart rate and CO2 production continued rising while O-2 consumption plateaued. These data indicate a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand at high temperatures. Exposure to extreme, diurnal fluctuations depressed embryo developmental rates and heart rates, and resulted in hatchlings with smaller body size, reduced growth rates, and lower survival in the laboratory. Thus, even brief exposure to extreme temperatures can have important effects on embryo development, and our study highlights the role of both immediate and cumulative effects of high temperatures on egg survival. Such effects must be considered to predict how populations will respond to global change.",,,,,"Hall, Joshua/AAP-7302-2020","Hall, Joshua/0000-0002-5587-3402; Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785",,,,,,,,,,,,,2471-5638,2471-5646,,,,JAN,2021,335,1,,,,,72,85,,10.1002/jez.2359,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.2359,,,,,,,,32297716,,,,,WOS:000614938000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We have carried out experiments with phytochrome mutants in cucumber and Arabidopsis as well as with cryptochrome mutants in Arabidopsis to investigate the involvement of specific light receptors in this thermoperiodic response. The WT and the phytochrome B deficient, long hypocotyl (lh) mutant of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) were grown under alternating DT and NT (DT/NT) of 25/19degreesC and 19/25degreesC combined with a 30 min. exposure to EOD-red (R) or EOD-FR light in growth rooms. WT and two phytochrome (phyA and phyB) and two cryptochrome deficient mutants (cry1 and cry2) of Arabidopsis thaliana 'Landsberg Erecta' were grown at DT/NT combinations of 25/17degreesC and 17/25degreesC. In WT cucumber grown under EOD-R light, stem, internode and hypocotyls were shorter under a low DT/high NT (negative DIF) compared to a high DT/low NT regime (positive DIF). EOD-FR light treatment completely eliminated the growth retarding effect of negative DIF on hypocotyl elongation and strongly reduced the negative DIF response on stem length. With respect to hypocotyl length, the lh mutant did not respond to the EOD treatment or alternating DT/NT. In Arabidopsis, DT/NT alternation showed similar responses on flower stem elongation and leaf morphology for the phyA, cry] and cry2 mutants compared to the WT. However, the phyB mutant showed significantly less response to alternating DT/NT than the WT. These results suggest that phytochrome B is required for a maximum effect of daily temperature alternations on stem elongation and leaf morphology in cucumber and Arabidopsis. The EOD-FR treatment, which almost eliminated the effect of negative DIF on stem elongation, indicates that a high amount of phytochrome in the active form (P-fr) is needed for a strong response to DIF in those species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,90-6605-238-4,,,,2003,,624,,,,,279,285,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2003.624.39,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2003.624.39,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000188827000039,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a growth experiment, mussels that were exposed to elevated aerial temperatures (21.5 degrees +/- 0.1 degrees C) for three hours each day displayed higher levels of FA compared to mussels exposed to cooler aerial temperatures (12.6 degrees +/- 0.1 degrees C). Reciprocal field transplant experiments revealed that FA increased under higher aerial temperatures (e.g., on a south facing surface [19.6 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C]) compared to individuals living in cooler habitats (e.g., on a north facing surface [15.2 degrees +/- 0.2 degrees C] or lower in the intertidal zone [14.1 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees C]).

The temperature calibration equations reduced inappropriate variations of qst caused by daily fluctuations in stem temperature, suggesting that these are essential for correct interpretation of monitoring data of qst in arid environments. The qst of the mesquite trees in Sudan clearly increased after heavy rainfall events and started decreasing when the soil water content became close to the wilting point. These findings indicate that mesquite trees use soil water in rainy seasons, even though they are generally considered to use groundwater through deep tap roots. The qst of neither species in the United States responded clearly to rainfall events, indicating that they depend on shallow saline groundwater.

What is the purpose of genetic variation of the mitochondrial DNA between individuals from the same population? As a simple laboratory model, Drosophila species can give us the answer to this question. Creating experimental lines with different combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear genomic DNA and testing how successful these lines were in surviving in different experimental set-ups enables us to deduce the effect that both genomes have on fitness. This study on D. obscura experimentally validates theoretical models that explain the persistence of mitochondrial DNA variation within populations. Our results shed light on the various mechanisms that maintain this type of variation. Finally, by conducting the experiments on two experimental temperatures, we have shown that environmental variations can support mitochondrial DNA variation within populations. The adaptive significance of sympatric mitochondrial (mtDNA) variation and the role of selective mechanisms that maintain it are debated to this day. Isofemale lines of Drosophila obscura collected from four populations were backcrossed within populations to construct experimental lines, with all combinations of mtDNA Cyt b haplotypes and nuclear genetic backgrounds (nuDNA). Individuals of both sexes from these lines were then subjected to four fitness assays (desiccation resistance, developmental time, egg-to-adult viability and sex ratio) on two experimental temperatures to examine the role of temperature fluctuations and sex-specific selection, as well as the part that interactions between the two genomes play in shaping mtDNA variation. The results varied across populations and fitness components. In the majority of comparisons, they show that sympatric mitochondrial variants affect fitness. However, their effect should be examined in light of interactions with nuDNA, as mito-nuclear genotype was even more influential on fitness across all components. We found both sex-specific and temperature-specific differences in mitochondrial and mito-nuclear genotype ranks in all fitness components. The effect of temperature-specific selection was found to be more prominent, especially in desiccation resistance. From the results of different components tested, we can also infer that temperature-specific mito-nuclear interactions rather than sex-specific selection on mito-nuclear genotypes have a more substantial role in preserving mtDNA variation in this model species.",,,,,"Davidović, Slobodan/GPX-0991-2022; Erić, Pavle/GWC-5625-2022","Rakic, Mina/0000-0002-6069-3369; Stamenkovic-Radak, Marina/0000-0002-6937-7282; Eric, Katarina/0000-0002-3456-2576; Jelic, Mihailo/0000-0002-1637-0933; Savic Veselinovic, Marija/0000-0001-8461-4373; Eric, Pavle/0000-0002-0053-1982; Tanaskovic, Marija/0000-0003-1440-2257; Davidovic, Slobodan/0000-0001-9317-6870; Patenkovic, Aleksandra/0000-0001-5763-6294",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2075-4450,,,,FEB,2022,13,2,,,,,,,139,10.3390/insects13020139,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects13020139,,,,,,,,35206713,,,,,WOS:000763620200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A linear model of the kinetics accounting for simple and interactive effects of storage time, temperature and pH was developed. Pre-dictions of the linear model were inconsistent with laboratory observations. The limitations of the linear model were reflected in the poor correlation of model predictions to the observed values (r(2) = 0.58). A proposed nonlinear model was therefore used to model the observed data. The four model parameters (N(0), C-c(0), k(max) and N-res) were optimized for each of the nine treatments.

Pioneer species use temperature fluctuations and light level as gap detection signals, but the relative importance of these two factors may differ among species with differently sized seeds. 2. We monitored changes in these environmental signals at different soil and litter depths in gaps and the adjacent forest understorey. We conducted a seed germination experiment in growth chambers to test the effects of darkness and red to far-red (R:FR) light ratios of 0.1, 0.4 and 1.0 under fluctuating (30/10 degrees C day/night) and constant (20 degrees C) temperatures; the experimental subjects belonged to 10 pioneer tree species with different seed sizes. 3. In forest gaps, light is a germination cue that is detectable only at or within 2 mm below the soil surface when litter is absent, whereas temperature signals can be detected in deeper soil. 4. The proportion of seeds germinating (percent germination) in small-seeded species (seed mass <= 1.05 mg) was strongly promoted by higher R: FR ratios, thereby ensuring germination of seeds close to the soil or litter surface. In contrast, the percent germination of large-seeded species (seed mass >= 200 mg) was strongly facilitated by temperature fluctuations, ensuring germination of seeds buried in even deep soil and litter. We detected interactive effects of the two signals in three species with medium-sized seeds (2.84-9.50 mg). 5. Across the temperate pioneer trees tested, the relative importance of light versus temperature regimens (as germination cues for gap detection) was strongly related to seed size.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,JUN,2016,30,6,,,,,866,874,,10.1111/1365-2435.12584,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12584,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000379979800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In general, ERA5 has the best performance in the CTD during the study period, followed closely by ERA-Interim. However, NCEP2 produces the largest error. The errors of all the reanalysis data show significant diurnal variations, and the diurnal variations differ from each other. Moreover, the results indicate that the reanalysis datasets have the largest deviation at 850 hPa (near the ground), which means that in the desert region complex interactions may exist between the land surface and the atmosphere.

LT50 values were established by freezing tests at different times of year. Damage and deaths were assessed on leader buds, subapical lateral buds, needles and cambium. Minor parallel experiments involved Abies nordmanniana, Picea abies and Picea sitchensis. Lower acclimation temperatures resulted in deeper frost hardiness during late autumn but less during spring, compared with ambient temperature controls. Elevated temperatures resulted in less deep frost resistance. Apical buds generally developed deeper frost hardiness than lateral buds but less deep than the cambium, varying with species, however. Frost damage in buds ranged from death over partially destroyed bud contents resulting in distorted shoots to buds seemingly remaining dormant. Responses to warm spells differed with duration, timing and species, ranging from dramatic decrease in frost hardiness with or without subsequent recovery to no reaction. Furthermore, the reactions did not show any clear relation to dormancy level. For A. procera, exposure to fluctuating temperatures appeared to be particularly problematic. This explains why this species develops best in coastal climates, and in sites sheltered from temperature extremes either by hedging, a winter snow cover, or topography. The Christmas tree production will suffer severely on sites with harsh temperatures due to losses of lateral and terminal buds, which destroy the crown symmetry. Clipping of greenery is less influenced by frost damages, although the development of normal branch whorls is often disturbed.",,,,,"Zimmerman, Steven C.

While a negative correlation between water temperatures and the time required between constitutive nesting events (termed the internesting interval) has been previously reported in loggerhead Caretta caretta and green turtles Chelonia mydas, it is not understood whether this relationship remains constant across other sea turtle species. Here, we expanded upon these pre-vious studies on loggerhead and green turtles by using larger sample sizes and including data from species with a wider range of body-sizes; specifically: hawksbill Eretmochelys imbricata, leatherback Dermochelys coriacea, and olive ridley turtles Lepidochelys olivacea. In total, we compiled temperature data from biologgers deployed over internesting intervals on 23 loggerhead, 22 green, 7 hawksbill, 26 leatherback and 11 olive ridley turtles from nesting sites in 8 different countries. The relationship between the duration of the internesting interval and water temperatures in green and loggerhead turtles were statistically similar yet it differed between all other turtle species. Specifically, hawksbill turtles had much longer internesting intervals than green or loggerhead turtles even after controlling for temperature. In addition, both olive ridley and leatherback turtles exhibited thermal independence of internesting intervals presumably due to the large body-size of leatherback turtles and the unique capacity of ridley turtles to delay oviposition. The observed interspecific differences in the relationship between the length of the internesting interval and water temperatures indicate the complex and variable re-sponses that each sea turtle species may exhibit due to environmental fluctuations and climate change.",,,,,,"Santidrian Tomillo, Pilar/0000-0002-6895-7218",,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4565,1879-0992,,,,OCT,2022,110,,,,,,,,103342,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103342,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2022.103342,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000868952600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Time series of 5-min EKG monitoring and body-temperature measurements were obtained for each animal in the CAPs and filtered air sham exposure groups. Our hypothesis was that chronic exposure could cause cumulative health effects. We used our recently developed nonparametric method to estimate the daily time periods that mean heart rates (HR), body temperature, and physical activity differed significantly between the CAPs and sham exposed groups. CAPs exposure most affected heart rate between 1:30 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. With the response variables being the average heart rate, body temperature, and physical activity, we adopted a two-stage modeling approach to obtain the estimates of chronic and acute effects on the changes of these three response variables. In the first stage, a time-varying model estimated daily crude effects. In the second stage, the true means of the estimated crude effects were modeled with a polynomial function of time for chronic effects, a linear term of daily CAPs exposure concentrations for acute effects, and a random component for unknown noise. A Bayesian framework combined these two stages. There were significant decreasing patterns of HR, body temperature, and physical activity for the ApoE(-/-) mice over the 5 mu of CAPs exposure, with smaller and nonsignificant changes for the C57 mice. The chronic effect changes of the three response variables for ApoE(-/-) mice were maximal in the last few weeks. There was also a significant relationship between CAPs exposure concentration and short-term change of heart rate in ApoE(-/-) mice during exposure. Response variables were also defined for examining fluctuations of 5-min heart rates within long (i.e., 3-6 h) and short time periods (i.e., similar to 15 min). The results for the ApoE(-/-) mice showed that heart-rate fluctuation within the longer periods increased to 1.35-fold by the end of exposure experiment, while the heart-rate fluctuation within 15 min decreased to 0.7-fold.",,,,,"Hwang, Jing-Shiang/AAP-2835-2021; Cjem, Lung-Chi/H-5030-2012","Hwang, Jing-Shiang/0000-0002-5807-7583; Chen, Lung Chi/0000-0003-1154-2107",,,,,,,,,,,,,0895-8378,1091-7691,,,,APR,2005,17,4-5,,,,,199,207,,10.1080/08958370590912761,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08958370590912761,,,,,,,,15804937,,,,,WOS:000227779500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the distribution laws of freeze-thaw cycles in a tunnel were carried out, and the concrete deterioration induced by freeze-thaw cycling was explored. First, in situ monitoring equipment was used to collect the temperature in the longitudinal direction of the tunnels. A one-dimensional heat transfer model was used to analyze the temperature distribution in the circumferential direction of the tunnels, where a function was proposed to describe both the annual and diurnal temperature fluctuations. After that, the distribution laws of freeze-thaw cycles inside a tunnel were investigated. Specifically, in the tunnel longitudinal direction, the number of freeze-thaw cycles decreased from the entrance to the middle and then increased while approaching the exit, thereby exhibiting a V-shaped distribution. In the circumferential direction, the intrados lining nearly always exhibited freeze-thaw cycles. The number of freeze-thaw cycles and the temperature amplitude decreased rapidly with increasing depth. Furthermore, a series of unsaturated concrete experiments were performed to explore the concrete deterioration under different numbers of freeze-thaw cycles. The results showed that after being subjected to 100 freeze-thaw cycles, the concrete specimens displayed visible damage, whereas the concrete compressive strength was not affected.

J,"Lolavar, A; Wyneken, J",,,,"Lolavar, Alexandra; Wyneken, Jeanette",,,Experimental assessment of the effects of moisture on loggerhead sea turtle hatchling sex ratios,ZOOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Sex determination in marine turtles is described by a cool-male, warm-female pattern. Nest sand temperature strongly influences sea turtle embryo development and sex differentiation. Yet, variation in hatchling sex ratios is explained only partially by nest temperature and can be predicted only at the warmest and coolest temperatures. Hence, other factors during development influence sex determination. Rainfall is a common environmental variable that may impact development and sex determination. We experimentally evaluated bias in sex ratio production associated with nest moisture. Conditions tested in surrogate nests were sand moisture in combination with (i) very restricted evaporation, (ii) moderate evaporation (allowing evaporative cooling), and (iii) evaporative cooling plus cooling from rain-temperature water. We collected eggs from 32 unique loggerhead (Caretta caretta L.) turtle clutches, distributed them among the three different conditions, and incubated the eggs until they hatched. All hatchlings were raised for several months and sex was verified laparoscopically to establish sex ratios for each treatment. The nests were expected to produce 50:50 sex ratios or a moderate female bias (-70%) based on incubation temperatures. All experimental treatments produced high male bias (87-96%). These results support the hypothesis that moisture impacts sex ratios through evaporation and rainfall-based cooling. High male bias was observed in nests with and without restricted evaporative cooling and no direct cooling due to watering as well as those nests hydrated via cool (rainwater temperature) water. High moisture conditions may produce males through thermal or other mechanisms, highlighting the importance of examining other nest environmental factors on sex determination. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

High levels were twice the amount of fertilizer at low levels maturity stage was expressed as days from heading during at spring growth. To measure aNDF degradation characteristics. feed samples were incubated in rumen for 0-144 h. The 144 h incubation was used as a measurement of IaNDF. A positive curvilinear relationship was observed between aNDF content and maturity stage. The IaNDF content (g/kg aNDF g/kg DM) increased (P<0.05) with maturity stage. At Vollebekk, the daily increase during spring growth was 2.2. 6.1 and 3.4 g IaNDF/kg DM in 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively, and corresponding values during summer growth was 3.0. 1.2 and 2.6g IaNDF/kg D M. At Holt, the content of IaNDF in summer growth was low and not affected (P<0.05) by maturity stage. The kdPaNDF decreased (P<0.05) with maturity stage. Increased N fertilization resulted in a higher (P<0.05) crude protein (CP) content. but did not affect (P>0.05) aNDF degradation characteristics. At Vollebekk the accumulated temperatures. measured in degree-days front the start of growth until heading. were 496, 486 and 504 degree-days ( Cd) over the 3 years.

Splitting the dataset with regard to location and spring growth/summer growth, R2 ranged from 0.53 to 0.90. It is concluded that the ruminal aNDF degradation characteristics are affected by maturity Stage, and interactions with climatic factors such as temperature and water availability probably interact with maturity stage.

We examined the position of the upper elevational limits of vascular plants in E Ladakh, India, by transplanting individuals of 14 subnival species from 5800-5850 m elevation to a control site at the same elevation, as well as to edaphically suitable sites at 5960 m (subnival belt with sparse plant cover), to 6030 m (the highest elevation reached by vascular plants in the area) and to 6160 m elevation (no vascular plants observed). Two years later, transplants of 13 species survived at the control elevation, whereas 5 species survived at 5960 m, 2 species (Waldheimia tridactylites, Poa attenuata) at 6030 m, and none at 6160 m. The highest elevation at which transplanted flowering plants survived corresponds well to the observed elevational limit. Soil temperature data at the sites suggest that the growing season, defined as the period with mean daily soil temperature above zero, lasted nearly 3 months at 5960 m, ca 1.5 month at 6030 m, but < 3 weeks at 6160 m, moreover interrupted at the highest elevation by several days with temperatures remaining below zero. The experiment confirmed the observed sharp limit of vegetation, set not by any physical barrier per se (e.g. not by the top of the massif), but instead by physiological constraints of the species.

First, we measured daily prey consumption rate and growth of age-0 and age-1 saugeyes fed two daily rations (ad libitum and 50% of maximum) at five temperatures ranging from 10 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Additional experiments quantified routine respiration rates and waste losses for three ages of saugeye (ages 0, 1, and 2) at five temperatures ranging from 10 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Mean daily rates of prey consumption (g.g(-1).d(-1)) by saugeyes increased from 10 degrees C to 25 degrees C, declining at 28 degrees C. Respiration rates (gO(2).g(-1).d(-1)) increased over the entire range of water temperatures. Waste losses were minor for saugeyes as egestion averaged 3.5% of consumed energy and energy lost via excretion was 4.5% of assimilated energy. We evaluated the accuracy of bioenergetics model predictions of saugeye prey consumption using daily prey consumption and corresponding growth data from our first set of experiments. Model estimates of prey consumption rates (g.g(-1).d(-1)) closely followed observed trends, providing reasonable estimates of cumulative prey consumption across temperature and fish size. The saugeye model provided improved estimates of consumption compared with a model published for walleyes (Kitchell et al. 1977), especially when water temperatures were in excess of 25 degrees C. The differences we observed in predictive performance between the two models resulted from higher thermal optima for saugeyes compared with walleyes, and waste constants for saugeyes were two to three times lower than those calculated from the walleye model. These differences may largely be responsible for the walleye model's overestimation of consumption. Saugeye thermal optima are warmer than those of either parent species, and saugeye is better suited for warm, productive midwestern U. S. reservoirs. The saugeye model developed herein will improve the ability of managers to more accurately predict the consumptive demand of in situ saugeye populations and better tailor stocking rates to match available prey biomass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8487,,,,,MAY,2010,139,3,,,,,855,867,,10.1577/T08-129.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T08-129.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000277639200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the same experiment, the TMAO content was determined for several tissues at varying plasma TMAO concentrations. TMAO accumulation begins at 5-7 degrees C, well above that which might be normally associated with an antifreeze response. The plasma concentration reached a plateau of 20 mM as temperatures reached 0 degrees C. Plasma TMAO concentration drops to pre-accumulation levels, less than 5 mM, when fish are held at elevated temperature (8-11 degrees C) and increases when fish are chilled below ambient seawater temperatures. However, despite temperatures near or below 0 degrees C, plasma TMAO decreases after the winter season. Changes in TMAoxi activity do not correlate with TMAO levels, suggesting that the activity of this enzyme does not play a key role in regulating TMAO concentrations in smelt. For the first time in any teleost fish, tissue TMAO contents in liver, kidney, brain, and intestine were found to strongly correlate with plasma TMAO concentrations. For these tissues, the intracellular and extracellular concentration of TMAO appears to be approximately equal. Conversely, the heart and white muscle accumulate TMAO, and in the case of white muscle, intracellular concentration is maintained at a constant level of approximately 35 mmol/kg, despite fluctuating plasma concentrations over a range from 0 to over 25 mM.

A link between temperature fluctuations and changes in fish stress response is well established. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of a short- (4 days) or a long-term (4 months) exposure to warm temperature in the stress physiology of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae and juveniles. First, cortisol (i.e. the main stress hormone in fishes) analysis was used to confirm that a steady and short-term elevation of temperature acts as a physiological stressful event in these fish, and cortisol release is indeed above a metabolic increase linked to temperature. Moreover, our results verified that measurement of cortisol released into the water can be reliably employed as a non-invasive indicator of acute thermal stress in experimental conditions. Secondly, the different effects on the genetic cascade underlying the stress response between long-term low or high thermal treatments were evaluated at two larval development stages via candidate-gene and whole-transcriptome approaches. Interestingly, opposite expression for some key stress genes (nr3c1, nr3c2 and hsd11b2) were observed between developmental stages, highlighting the distinct adaptive mechanisms controlling the primary and secondary responses to a stressor. Surprising expression patterns for some understudied genes involved in the stress axis were also revealed, including crhr1, mc2r, mc5r, trh or trhr, which should be further explored. Finally, evaluation of cortisol content in scales was successfully used as a biomarker of chronic thermal stress, with 10x more cortisol in fish kept at 21 degrees C vs 16 degrees C after 4 months, supporting the gene expression results observed. The use of such a method as a proxy of long-term stress, unprecedented in the literature, holds a vast array of applications in further research, in particular, in the investigation of the impact of global warming on wild fish populations.",,,,,"Goikoetxea, Alexander/AAA-8268-2021; Geffroy, Benjamin/D-1541-2012","Goikoetxea, Alexander/0000-0002-3503-4943; Geffroy, Benjamin/0000-0001-6120-1103; Blondeau-Bidet, Eva/0000-0002-8409-3544; Sadoul, Bastien/0000-0001-5968-3983",,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,JAN,2021,120,,,,,,,,106937,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106937,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106937,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000591880800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Body temperature increased faster in beetles of dark morph than in beetles of light morph under exposure to artificial irradiation. Dark males ran faster than light males in both field and laboratory experiments, and this difference decreased with increasing ambient air temperature, from significant at 10 degrees C to non-significant at 20 degrees C and 26 degrees C. On cold days (6-14 degrees C), significantly more dark males than light males were found on their host plants in copula (40.8% and 27.3% respectively); on warm days (15-22 degrees C) this difference disappeared. Light females produced twice as many eggs as dark females; this difference did not depend on the ambient temperature. The proportion of dark morphs in the progenies of pairs with one dark parent was twice as high as that in the progenies of pairs in which both parents were light, and this proportion was greater when larvae developed at low (10 and 15 degrees C) than at high (20 and 25 degrees C) temperatures. We conclude that low temperatures may increase the frequencies of dark morphs in degrees C. lapponica populations due to both the mating advantages of dark males over light males and developmental plasticity. Variation in frequencies of low-fecund dark morphs in the population, caused by among-year differences in temperature together with density-dependent selection, may contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of the colour polymorphism and may influence abundance fluctuations in these leaf beetle populations.",,,,,"Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013; Forsman, Anders/G-8778-2012","Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244; Forsman, Anders/0000-0001-9598-7618",,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4565,,,,,MAY,2018,74,,,,,,100,109,,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.03.019,,,,,,,,29801614,,,,,WOS:000436526200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The adoption of gravel-sand mulching has shown improvements in the growth of crops such as watermelon. The ridge and furrow rainwater harvest system (RFRHS) has been shown as an easy and efficient way to collect rainwater. A field experiment was conducted from 2007 to 2009 at Gaolan, Lanzhou, Gansu, China, to measure the effects of URNS, plastic mulch and gravel-sand mulch combinations on soil temperature, evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency (WUE) and watermelon yield. There were eight treatments: (1) flat gravel-sand mulched field, (2) RFRHS with a sand mulched furrow, entire plastic mulch and the ratio 1:1 of ridge and furrow, (3) RFRHS with a sand mulched furrow, entire plastic mulch and the ratio 4:3 of ridge and furrow, (4) RFRHS with a sand mulched furrow, entire plastic mulch and the ratio 5:3 of ridge and furrow, (5) RFRHS with a sand and plastic mulched furrow, bare ridge and the ratio 4:3 of ridge and furrow, (6) RFRHS with an entire plastic mulch and the ratio 4:3 of ridge and furrow, (7) conventional ridge planting with a plastic mulched ridge, and (8) flat gravel-sand mulched field plus 23 mm supplementary irrigation. Soil temperature for RFRHS with a gravel-sand plus plastic mulched furrow was slightly lower than that of flat gravel-sand mulch. The RFRHS caused a significant increase in watermelon yield and WUE. The increase in watermelon yield and WUE was greatly influenced by the ratio of ridge and furrow when RFRHS was combined with gravel-sand mulch. Watermelon yield was highest for the 1:1 ratio, and WUE was highest for the 5:3 and 1:1 ratios of ridge:furrow, and these were significantly greater than that of flat gravel-sand mulch, without or with irrigation. The use of ridge with plastic film mulch increased the beneficial effect of RFRHS on yield. The watermelon yield and WUE for non-plastic-mulched ridge were even lower than that of flat gravel-sand mulch. In summary, the findings suggest that RFRHS with gravel-sand mulched furrow plus plastic film mulch, and 1:1 ratio of ridge:furrow, would facilitate the use of limited rainfall most efficiently in improving watermelon yield, by reducing ET and increasing WUE in this semiarid region.

Nevertheless, the effect of illumination on the constant rate of residual nitrite depletion was dependent on the storage temperature.

Annual or geographic fluctuations in yield due to heat stress can have a significant influence on total production. To increase the stability of canola yield, breeders need to select for increased heat tolerance in a reliable, repeatable, cost effective manner that represents commercial production conditions. Field experiments with 10 (5 maintainer and 5 restorer) inbreds and the 25 corresponding hybrids were conducted across 2 years with 2 locations per year. Each experiment had two planting dates (normal planting date and a late planting date). The experiments were designed to determine If: 1) planting date can be used as a proxy for heat stress; 2) heterosis can minimize the impact of heat stress; and 3) direct selection within a heat-stress environment improves genetic gain for heat stress tolerance. Principal component analysis of the Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, soil moisture, daily light integral and yield were conducted. The resulting biplot analyses demonstrate that the temperature variables had a greater impact on yield than soil moisture or daily light integral and therefore planting date was identified as a successful proxy for heat stress. The heat-stress treatment caused a 23% mean reduction in seed yield (20% reduction within the hybrids and 25% reduction within the inbreds) indicating that heterosis can reduce the impact of higher temperatures on canola yield. The mean heat susceptibility index was 0.94 and 1.20 for the hybrids and inbreds respectively; further demonstrating that the hybrids were more heat tolerant than the inbreds. Analyses of the GCA for the inbreds shows 4 cross-over interactions between the two temperature treatments indicating that direct selection for heat tolerance will be necessary to increase the response to selection for this trait. Overall canola breeders interested in increasing heat tolerance need to consider utilizing planting date as a high-temperature treatment and cannot rely on indirect selection from experiments under optimal conditions.",,,,,,"Gardner, Stuart/0000-0001-9022-2579",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-4290,1872-6852,,,,MAY 15,2018,221,,,,,,61,70,,10.1016/j.fcr.2018.02.014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2018.02.014,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000430767300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a laboratory study conducted under seasonally varying temperature conditions, we evaluated the nutritional vulnerability in different cohorts (August, September, October, November, December, and January) of first-stage larvae of a porcellanid crab, Petrolisthes laevigatus. Besides continuously fed and starved control groups (FC, SC), the experimental treatments comprised: (1) differential periods of initial starvation and subsequent feeding (point-of-no-return. PNR: minimum time of initial starvation preventing recovery after later feeding); (2) initial feeding and subsequent starvation (point-of-reserve-saturation. PRS: minimum time of initial feeding allowing for food-independent development through the rest of the moulting cycle); (3) limited daily access to prey (feeding pulses, 4 and 6 h/day). The development time of FC larvae ranged from 10.6 +/- 0.4 days (January) to 21.9 +/- 2.6 days (August), without significant variation in mortality among cohorts. Under continuous absence of food (SC), first-stage larvae never survived to the zoea II. Short-term feeding pulses had significantly different effects on development time of different cohorts, but not on survival. The PNR was lowest in larvae produced near the end of spring (November). However, when the PNR was expressed as a percentage of the development time in FC larvae, no significant differences were found among cohorts (relative PNR: 32.8-42.5%). The relative PRS was reached after 60.6-73.5% of the development time in FC larvae. In spite of strong seasonal (presumably temperature-induced) differences in the absolute PNR and PRS values of different cohorts, the relative values were generally similar. This suggests that successive cohorts of early larvae can develop with similar success, unless severe winter conditions or oceanographic fluctuations cause a significant decline in short-term prey availability or plankton productivity. Due to long development duration at low temperatures, the larvae produced in winter and early spring have greater potential for dispersal, favoring a genetic exchange between distant populations and colonization of new habitats. Summer larvae, by contrast, may be more important for maintaining local populations. An index of nutritional vulnerability (NVI = PRS50/PNR50) is proposed in this paper to compare larvae with differential developmental times. In most larvae studied so far, the NVI is <1, indicating some degree of independence of food. In larvae of P. laevigatus an index >1 reflects a relatively high degree of dependence on planktonic food, especially in winter larvae. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Average monthly soil temperatures within the top 65 cm ranged from about 8 to 20degreesC under pine and 7 to 18degreesC under oak. Average monthly water contents ranged from 8 to 32% (by volume) under pine and 6 to 32% under oak. In contrast, average monthly soil temperatures within the top 65 cm under chamise ranged from 6 to 23degreesC and average monthly water contents were 6 to 36%. Diurnal variation in soil surface temperature under chamise was much more pronounced than under oak and pine because of the relatively open canopy and thin litter layer. Microclimate created by chamise may play an important role in the decomposition rate of litter, but appears to have little influence on soil processes occurring within the mineral soil. Soil macrofannal communities appear to have a greater effect than microclimate in causing the divergent soil morphologies under oak and pine.",,,,,"Johnson-Maynard, Jodi L/E-9518-2013; Quideau, Sylvie A/C-9646-2015","Johnson-Maynard, Jodi L/0000-0002-4450-4636; Quideau, Sylvie A/0000-0002-2297-9024",,,,,,,,,,,,,0361-5995,1435-0661,,,,MAY-JUN,2004,68,3,,,,,876,884,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000221351400021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Densities in the tank ranged from five to twenty parr, at water temperatures ranging from 4.6 degrees C to 15.8 degrees C. The wide channel of the stream tank, with mean water velocity of 18.8 cm center dot s(-1), was the preferred section, where territorial behaviour was observed. Biomass was regulated in the wide channel by territorial mosaics or by dominance hierarchies. Dominance hierarchies were reflected in coloration of the fish. Dominant salmon were generally in the wide channel. Densities of salmon parr (of mean fork length 10.2cm) in the channel ranged from 0.84 m(-2) to 1.73 m(-2), with an average biomass of 14.2 g center dot m(-2). Growth was least at the 5.9 degrees C temperature treatment. In experiments at temperatures below 10 degrees C, feeding, dominance hierarchy and territorial behaviour were observed in daylight hours, contrary to the published literature. Interactions with other species may affect behaviour. Some observations were made on a closely related species, brown trout (Salmo trutta L.), a commonly cohabiting species in many systems. Trout displaced salmon from their preferred locations in the tank and were more aggressive than the salmon, reducing agonistic behaviour by the salmon. The commonest agonistic act shown by salmon was 'charge' and that by the trout was 'approach'. Some field observations affecting behaviour and production are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-6691,1600-0633,,,,JUL,2015,24,3,,,,,397,411,,10.1111/eff.12154,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12154,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000356455900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

It was hypothesized that the development rate lines of ectotherms within a taxon such as a family would have a common intersection. Thus for a given temperature, the development time should be the same for all the species within any specified taxon. In the current study, the data on temperature-dependent development rates of species of the Aphididae and Tetranychidae families were used to test the validity of the common-intersection hypothesis. The hypothesis was supported with either dataset used. In addition, the current study tested the common-intersection hypothesis through mathematical analysis on the basis of two linear relationships (i.e., the linear relationship between temperature and development rate and that between the lower developmental threshold and the sum of effective temperatures). An attempt was made to combine the rate isomorphy hypothesis that all the lower developmental thresholds of different stages were assumed to be equal for a single species with the common-intersection hypothesis for related species within a taxon and hypothesize that if these two hypotheses hold, then for any developmental stages a common temperature of all stages should exist.

Such evolution will expectedly lead to changes in the populations' thermal reaction norm and improve their ability to cope with stressful conditions. Conversely, evolutionary constraints might limit the adaptive response. Here, we test these expectations by performing a real-time evolution experiment in historically differentiated Drosophila subobscura populations. We address the phenotypic change after nine generations of evolution in a daily fluctuating environment with average constant temperature, or in a warming environment with increasing average and amplitude temperature across generations. Our results showed that (1) evolution under a global warming scenario does not lead to a noticeable change in the thermal response; (2) historical background appears to be affecting responses under the warming environment, particularly at higher temperatures; and (3) thermal reaction norms are trait dependent: although lifelong exposure to low temperature decreases fecundity and productivity but not viability, high temperature causes negative transgenerational effects on productivity and viability, even with high fecundity.

Yet, relatively little species-specific information is available regarding the stress responses and associated welfare implications for this species in captivity. We addressed this knowledge gap by using a combination of implantable heart rate bio-loggers and a range of traditional stress indicators (e.g. haematological parameters and plasma concentrations of cortisol, glucose and ions) to comprehensively evaluate the physiological responses of freely swimming whitefish in captivity, as well as when subjected to aquaculture practices and stressors that commonly occur prior to and during slaughter. Whitefish appeared to recover rapidly from surgery, as resting heart rate decreased within 36 h to stabilize at similar to 25 beats min(-1) for the next 18 days when fish were left relatively undisturbed (i.e. personnel were only present when feeding fish). In contrast with previous studies on farmed rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon, whitefish did not exhibit a clear circadian heart rate rhythm, which may be related to species-specific differences in diurnal locomotor activity. Whitefish also appear to have a well-developed capacity for thermal acclimation of heart rate, as daily resting heart rate did not change during the undisturbed period despite an increase in body temperature from similar to 6.8 to 11.2 degrees C. Following acute stressors such as crowding and transportation, the physiological response of whitefish typically involved transient elevations in heart rate, plasma cortisol and glucose, and red blood cell swelling, while plasma [K+] decreased. In contrast, the heart rate of whitefish plummeted following the combination of brailing (i.e. to haul in fish with a brail/net) and CO2 exposure prior to slaughter, while plasma cortisol, glucose and [Ca2+] significantly increased. An unforeseen finding concerns the substantial and long-lasting physiological stress response observed in whitefish when held in close proximity (i.e. within similar to 10 m) to a rainbow trout net pen, as the mean heart rate of whitefish increased from similar to 32 to 43 beats min(-1) (i.e. an increase of similar to 34%). This may represent an innate physiological response to the threat of predation, which consequently increases the allostatic load and energetic expenditure of whitefish when farmed alongside salmonids. To conclude, this study highlights the importance of performing long-term, species-specific evaluations of freely swimming fish in real aquaculture settings, and provides a platform for further research aiming to determine the welfare implications of simultaneously farming predatory and prey species in close proximity.",,,,,"Roques, Jonathan A.C/Q-3539-2016; Berg, Charlotte/G-5760-2012; Sundell, Kristina/F-8884-2016","Roques, Jonathan A.C/0000-0002-9971-5975; Berg, Charlotte/0000-0001-5671-5273; Grans, Albin/0000-0003-0268-1199; Sundell, Kristina/0000-0002-7643-2083",,,,,,,,,,,,,0044-8486,1873-5622,,,,MAR 15,2021,534,,,,,,,,736258,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736258,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736258,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000614763900015,View Full Record in Web of Science

These effects arises from associated changes in skin permeability, metabolism and lung ventilation. Herein, we determined the rates of EWLSkin and EWLResp in the terrestrial toad, Rhinella diptycha at different temperatures and hydration states. We measured oxygen uptake rates to verify whether alterations in the partitioning between EWLSkin and EWLResp were associated to metabolic induced changes in pulmonary gas exchange. We also measured the influence of hydration and temperature on water uptake (WU) through the skin. Finally, since estimates of skin resistance to evaporation (R-s) are usually inferred from total evaporative water loss (EWLTotal), under the assumption of negligible EWLResp, we calculate the potential error in accepting this assumption, under different temperature and hydration states. EWLSkin and EWLResp increased with temperature, but this response was greater for EWLResp, which was attributed to the temperature-induced elevation in metabolism and lung ventilation. Dehydration caused a decrease in the relative contribution of EWLSkin to EWLTotal, mirrored by the concurrent increase in the contribution of EWLResp, at all temperatures. Thus, R-s increased with dehydration. WU rates were dictated by dehydration with little influence of temperature. The partitioning between EWLSkin and EWLResp was affected by both temperature and hydration state and, under some set of conditions, considering EWLResp as negligible led to significant errors in the assessment of skin resistance to evaporation.",,,,,,"Senzano Castro, Luis Miguel/0000-0001-9627-1355",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,DEC,2018,221,24,,,,,,,jeb188482,10.1242/jeb.188482,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.188482,,,,,,,,30385484,,,,,WOS:000454692700012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experiment 1 showed that after 18 days of storage at 2 degrees C fertilization capacity of eggs was undiminished. At 7 degrees C, unimpaired fertilization capacity was maintained for 12 days and at 10 degrees C for 6 days. This leads to the conclusion that for storage up to approximately 1 week an ordinary household refrigerator will suffice; for more extended storage periods lower temperatures are advised. If PE bags filled with unfertilized eggs were submerged in water during chilling, similar results were obtained, though at a slightly lower level. The second experiment showed that fluctuations in chilling temperature between 2 degrees C and 10 degrees C were tolerated by unfertilized eggs as long as sufficient adaptation time was granted. One or two temperature changes within a 12 day period had no impact on fertilization capacity, whereas repeated changes at 2 day intervals caused a reduction in fertilization capacity. The attempt to apply the method of chilled storage of unfertilized rainbow trout eggs in PE bags to fertilized eggs (Experiment 3) indicated that early eyed eggs (14 days incubation at 10 degrees C) may be stored at 2 degrees C for 10 days without loss in hatching rate. Reasonable hatching rates may be achieved at 7 degrees C for about one week and at 10 degrees C for about 4 days.

The aim of the paper is to evaluate the possibility to extend the production season and to use different thermal-unit methods for predicting different cultivation phase and the flowering time. Two species of bedding plants (Catharanthus roseus 'Carmine Red' and Tagetes erecta 'Perfection') were compared at 12 sowing dates for 12 months, started from March 2004 until February 2005. Plantlets were potted after the development of two-three true leaves and cultivated according to the standard procedures. Emergency and timing of transplanting, first visible bud and anthesis of 1st flower were recorded. Growth parameters like plant height, leaf area, no of flowers, flower diameter were also measured. Mean daily temperature were registered and used to calculate, through thermal unit methods, the thermal data for each phenophase. During the experimental period, great differences were found for the ten-day mean air temperature and the ten-day mean daily radiations. The length of growing cycle was strongly modified in both species in relation to the photo-thermal conditions. In Catharanthus the length of growing cycle ranged between 49 (sowing in June) and 164 days (sowing in November); in Tagetes these values ranged between 51 (sowing in September) and 101 days (sowing in November). Growth parameters were also deeply influenced by the different cultivation cycles, especially in Catharanthus. The extension of the sowing dates permits a very long period of commercialization mainly in Tagetes. The results indicated that the thermal-unit methods were more efficient than the calendar day method, and suggested that a relatively simple temperature-time scale could adequately predict the flowering date.",,,,,,"ROMANO, Daniela/0000-0002-4810-2124",,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,978-90-6605-731-9,,,,2009,807,,,,,,705,710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000305334500106,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ectothermic animals may undergo concerted metabolic shifts in response to ambient temperature changes. The physiological and molecular adaptations in cephalopods during their early life stages are largely unknown due to the challenge of rearing them outside of a natural marine environment. To overcome this obstacle, we established a pelagic bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana) culture facility, which allowed us to monitor the effects of ambient thermal elevation and fluctuation on cephalopod embryos/larvae. By carefully observing embryonic development in the breeding facility, we defined 23 stages of bigfin reef squid embryonic development, beginning at stage 12 (blastocyst; 72 h post-egg laying) and continuing through hatching (similar to 1 month post-egg laying). Since temperature recordings from the bigfin reef squid natural habitats have shown a steady rise over the past decade, we examined energy substrate utilization and cellular/metabolic responses in developing animals under different temperature conditions. As the ambient temperature increased by 7 degrees C, hatching larvae favored aerobic metabolism by about 2.3fold. Short-term environmental warming stress inhibited oxygen consumption but did not affect ammonium excretion in stage (St.) 25 larvae. Meanwhile, an aerobic metabolism-related marker (CoxI) and a cellular stress-responsive marker (HSP70) were rapidly up-regulated upon acute warming treatments. In addition, our simulations of temperature oscillations mimicking natural daily rhythms did not result in significant changes in metabolic processes in St. 25 animals. As the ambient temperature increased by 7 degrees C, referred to as heatwave conditions, CoxI, HSP70, and antioxidant molecule (SOD) were stimulated, indicating the importance of cellular and metabolic adjustments. As with other aquatic species with high metabolic rates, squid larvae in the tropical/sub-tropical climate zone undergo adaptive metabolic shifts to maintain physiological functions and prevent excessive oxidative stress under environmental warming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,OCT 20,2022,844,,,,,,,,156962,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156962,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156962,,,,,,,,35779738,,,,,WOS:000862857100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

MODEL DESCRIPTION AND VALIDATION,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"NTKENAF (Version 1 . 1) is a computer model which simulates the growth of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) under rainfed conditions in tropical Australia. In daily time-steps, the model simulates the phenology, leaf area development, biomass accumulation and partitioning, soil water balance and dry matter yields of kenaf plants based on climatic and management inputs. The model assumes adequate nutrition and no effect of pests and diseases. The model uses daily maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation and rainfall. The duration from sowing to flowering is predicted using temperature and photoperiod. Leaf growth is described as a function of node production (as determined by temperature), leaf area per node and leaf area senescence. Potential daily biomass is predicted from leaf area index, the light extinction coefficient and radiation use efficiency, and partitioned to the economic stem yield. Soil evaporation is predicted using a two-stage evaporation model, and plant transpiration is predicted from the daily biomass accumulation, a transpiration efficiency coefficient and predicted daily vapour pressure deficit. Plant extractable soil water is dependent on the available soil water range for each depth increment, the extraction front velocity, and the extent of water extraction at each depth. Daily transpiration and leaf growth are decreased below potential values once the fraction of available soil water declines below a threshold value. NTKENAF V1 . 1 has been validated against observed data from kenaf experiments conducted at two sites (lat. 13-degrees-48'S. and 14-degrees-28'S.) in northern Australia. The predictive accuracy of the model was good over a range in above-ground biomass up to 25 000 kg ha-1 (n = 40, r2 = 0.94, root mean square deviation = 1716 kg ha-1). Validations were also undertaken for predictions of the core and bark stem components, leaf area index and plant extractable soil water contents.

The results show that there have relative large biases in temperature observations between the GPS-TK and the R592-SGP in the low troposphere, with a warm bias of greater than 2 Kin the day and a cooling bias of 0.6 K at night. The temperature differences of the CF-06-A were small in the troposphere both in daytime and nighttime, and became large peak-to-peak fluctuations in the stratosphere. The intercomparison of the relative humidity showed that the CF-06-A had large random errors due to the limitation of sensors and the lack of correction scheme, and the GPS-TK had large systematic biases in the low troposphere which might be related to the temperature impact.

However, many studies that evaluate these effects have relied on experimental conditions that are rarely, if ever, encountered under natural conditions. To address this issue, we evaluated relationships among maternal factors, natural nest conditions, egg development in the field, and the resultant offspring phenotypes in a lizard with temperature-dependent sex determination, the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus, Agamidae). Many, but not all, of the relationships shown in our field-based study corroborate results from laboratory-based experiments. Offspring body size was affected primarily by egg size at oviposition, as well as by water uptake by eggs, rather than by environmental variables measured within the nest. Date of oviposition was related to offspring growth rate and body size prior to the onset of winter; this relationship is likely mediated through an influence on the timing of hatching. Nest temperature generated substantial variation in egg survival; nests that experienced higher temperatures and higher thermal fluctuations suffered relatively high egg mortality. Contrary to results from laboratory incubation, however, nest temperature did not predict offspring sex ratios. Hence, although many results from this field study corroborate those from the laboratory, caution is needed when extrapolating laboratory-incubation results to field conditions.",,,,,"Rohlf, F J/A-8710-2008","Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,AUG,2009,161,1,,,,,209,220,,10.1007/s00442-009-1366-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1366-1,,,,,,,,19452172,,,,,WOS:000267345500019,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, limited high-tunnel research has been performed in arid high-elevation regions that experience extreme diurnal temperature fluctuations. High tunnels are designed to be passively heated; therefore, additional protection from frost may be warranted if growers wish to plant significantly earlier than normal. Low tunnels built within a high tunnel reduce the energy requirement by concentrating heat around the plants, particularly when a heat source is placed inside the low tunnel. 'Sunbrite' tomatoes were transplanted through black plastic mulch in four high tunnels in North Logan, UT (lat. 41.73 degrees N, long. 111.83 degrees W, 1382 m elevation) on 17 Mar., 30 Mar., and 7 Apr. in 2009 and on 19 Mar., 30 Mar., and 9 Apr. in 2010. Low tunnels were constructed over each row, and three supplemental heat treatments (unheated, soil-warming cables, and soil-warming cables plus 40-W incandescent lights) were tested to improve plant performance. The highest total marketable yield was achieved for earliest planting dates in both 2009 and 2010. In 2009, early-season yield was significantly greater when both the soil + air were heated, but only for the earliest planting date. In 2010, soil heat alone and in conjunction with air heat significantly improved early-season yield.

The stock culture medium was illuminated by approximately 50 mu mol photons m(-2)s(-1) of illumination with 14/24 daylight.

In this context, nutrient measurements were made on samples of the exponential, stationary and death phase of the culture and nutrient analyses were carried out.

Consequently, considering the lifetime of the diatom at different temperature conditions, T3 was determined as an optimum temperature. Maximum growth rate and process time were observed at this temperature. This explains why these diatoms are abundant available in the winter. Once the light intensity was increased, the growth rate was increased at the T1 and T2 temperatures. However, T3 had a high growth rate at nearly L1 light intensity.

Atlantic salmon (101 +/- 2 g) and rainbow trout (125 +/- 3 g) were reared in seawater at either 13 C-omicron (optimum for growth) or 19 C-omicron during the 35 days experiment (n = 4 tanks for each treatment). At the end of the experiment, the prevalence of cataracts was nearly 100% for Atlantic salmon compared to similar to 50% for rainbow trout, irrespective of temperature. The severity of the cataracts, as evaluated by slit-lamp inspection of the lens, was almost three fold higher in Atlantic salmon compared to rainbow trout. The global metabolic profile revealed differences in lens composition and metabolism between the two species, which may explain the observed differences in cataract susceptibility between the species. The largest differences were seen in the metabolism of amino acids, especially the histidine metabolism, and this was confirmed by a separate quantitative analysis.

P.",,,The Influence of Environmental Conditions on Intake Behavior and Activity by Feedlot Steers Fed Corn or Barley-Based Diets,ANIMALS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Simple Summary Cattle wintered at northern latitudes are often exposed to periods of severe cold. Cattle likely alter feed intake and behavior to combat environmental challenges. This study evaluated the influence of diet and environmental changes on intake behavior and activity (lying time) of feedlot steers. Short-term temperature changes impacted both beef feedlot cattle intake behavior and activity. The steers' diet, whether they were fed corn or barley, interacted with short term environmental changes to influence animal feeding behavior, but diet had limited impact on cattle lying behavior. Lying behavior was influenced by short-term temperature changes in which cattle spent more time lying down on relatively cold days. Overall, environmental shifts and cold temperature conditions could result in greater energetic needs and ultimately impact feedlot steer intake behavior and activity. By providing information related to beef cattle feedlot behavior, we can more effectively manage cattle feeding systems at northern latitudes to improve feed efficiency. This study evaluated the influence of diet and environmental conditions on intake behavior and activity of feedlot steers. Feedlot rations used were comprised of a main concentrate: (1) corn or (2) barley. A GrowSafe system measured individual animal intake and behavior and HOBO accelerometers measured steer standing time. An Onset weather station collected on site weather data. Steer daily intake displayed a diet by temperature class interaction (p <= 0.05). Relative temperature change had no effect on variation in intake (p = 0.60); however, diet influenced variation of intake (p < 0.01), where corn-fed steers had a greater coefficient of variation (CV) than barley-fed steers (21.89 +/- 1.46 vs. 18.72 +/- 1.46%). Time spent eating (min d(-1)) and eating rate (g min(-1)) both displayed a diet by temperature class interaction (p <= 0.05). Diet did not affect steer lying activity (p >= 0.12), however, time spent lying (min d(-1)) and frequency of lying bouts (bouts d(-1)) increased on relatively cold days while the duration of lying bouts (min bout(-1); p < 0.01) decreased.

Many mobile consumers living on the shore are immobile during low tide, and can be exposed to high temperatures on calm, warm days. Rising body temperatures can raise metabolic rates, induce stress responses, and potentially affect growth and survival, but the effects may differ among species with different microhabitat preferences. We measured aerial and aquatic respiration rates of 4 species of Lottia limpets from central California, and estimated critical thermal maxima. In a variety of microhabitats in the field, we tracked body temperatures and measured limpet growth rates on experimental plates colonized by natural microalgae. Limpet species found higher on the shore had lower peak respiration rates during high temperature aerial exposure, and had higher critical thermal maxima. Using our long-term records of field body temperatures, we estimated cumulative respiration to be 5 to 14% higher in warm microhabitats. Growth rates in the field appear to be driven by an interaction between available microalgal food resources, low tide temperature, and limpet species identity, with limpets from warmer micro habitats responding positively to higher food availability and higher low tide temperatures. Stressful conditions in warm microhabitats make up a small portion of the total lifetime of these limpets, but the greater proportion of time spent at non-stressful, but warm, body temperatures may result in enhanced growth compared to limpets living in cooler microhabitats.",,,,,"; Miller, Luke/B-8992-2009","Denny, Mark/0000-0003-0277-9022; Miller, Luke/0000-0002-2009-6981",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,MAR 2,2015,522,,,,,,127,143,,10.3354/meps11117,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps11117,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000350667800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Measurements were made during the wheat growing season in Western Australia under continuous wheat, during the wheat phase of a 1 year lupin:1 year wheat rotation, during the wheat phase of a 2 year pasture:1 year wheat rotation, and under a subterranean clover pasture. The accuracy of gross N mineralisation and NH4+ consumption within intact soil cores was reduced by the large spatial variation in the size of the soil NH4+ pool. Calculated daily rates of gross N mineralisation in the 0-5 cm soil layer ranged from 0.0 to 1.0 kg N/ha.day in the continuous wheat, 0.1 to 0.8 kg N/ha.day in the lupin-wheat rotation, -0.1 to 1.3 kg N/ha.day in the pasture-wheat rotation, and -0.1 to 2.5 kg N/ha.day in the pasture treatment. Gross N mineralisation in the 5-10 cm soil layer under wheat followed the same range observed in the 0-5 cm layer; in continuous pasture, lower rates were measured in the 5-10 cm layer compared with the 0-5 cm layer. the range in daily rates of NH4+ consumption in a given treatment was similar to the range in daily rates of gross N mineralisation, precluding accumulation of NH4+ in soil when considered over a season. Gross N mineralised in the 0-10 cm soil layer was equivalent to 10-19% of the total soil N in this layer. Net N mineralised, determined from the difference between gross N mineralisation and gross immobilisation, was estimated to be about half of the gross N mineralised during the wheat growing season. Plant uptake was estimated to be 13-37% of the total gross N mineralised (0-10 cm) during the field season and was greater in the wheat after legume compared with continuous wheat. Potentially available N, measured by anaerobic incubation, declined by about one-third during the season. At the beginning of the season, microbial biomass-N in the 0-5 cm soil layer contained 61 kg N/ha in continuous wheat, 68 kg N/ha in the lupin-wheat rotation, 73 kg N/ha in the pasture-wheat rotation, and 99 kg N/ha under pasture. Only half of these quantities of microbial biomass were detected by the end of the season. Microbial biomass-N was concentrated in the surface soil layer with <25 kg N/ha in the 5-10 cm soil layer under each land use. A reasonable estimate of gross N mineralisation was obtained in the continuous wheat and legume-wheat rotations by using a simple empirical relationship based on the size and activity of the microbial biomass, and functions to describe the effect of temperature and water on microbial activity. However, the pattern of gross N mineralisation in the pasture treatment could not be explained using this approach.",,,,,"Fillery, Ian/AAL-4050-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-9409,,,,,,1998,49,3,,,,,523,535,,10.1071/A97096,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/A97096,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000072637600020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sitona lineatus populations are monitored in spring by assessing adult-induced feeding damage. We assume the quantity of feeding damage is indicative of population density. However, the effects of abiotic factors, including temperature, on feeding rate are not known. We assessed the effects of temperature, population density, and sex on S. lineatus feeding rate by counting feeding notches on host plants exposed to adult weevils for 24 hours at four densities and under five temperature regimes. Individual females consumed more than male weevils. As expected, feeding damage increased with weevil density. The influence of temperature increased as weevil densities increased. Feeding rate did not differ between constant and fluctuating temperature regimes of equal mean daily temperature.

K. Koch] orchards near Las Cruces, NM. Diurnal measurements of psi(stem) and psi(leaf) at three canopy heights were correlated under both dry and wet soil conditions. However, although soil water contents at Site 2 (silty clay loam texture) remained higher compared with Site 1 (sandy loam), psi(stem) and psi(leaf) values, 7 stem particularly under dry soil conditions at Site 2, were consistently lower, showing the effect of clayey soil texture on pecan water stress. Diurnal patterns of psi(stem) and psi(leaf) indicated that measurements of psi(stem) and psi(leaf) should be made close to early afternoon (between 1400 and 1500 HR Mountain Standard Time) to evaluate mature pecan water stress, which also corresponded to maximum climatic stress conditions. Midday psi(stem) and psi(leaf) measured at 7 stem three canopy heights over several irrigation cycles during the 2010 season were correlated with one another, midday soil water content at different depths, and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Multiple regression analysis [between midday psi(stem) or psi(leaf) and midday theta(avg) (soil water content at 0 to 40 cm), air temperature (T-md), and relative humidity (RHmd)] during the 2010 season revealed that two-parameter regression models [psi(stem) or psi(leaf) = f (midday theta(avg) and T-md)] were the most significant for the interpretation of midday psi(stem) or psi(leaf) at both sites. Using the two-parameter model, predictions of psi(stem) and psi(leaf) measured on the both shaded and sunlit sides of trees at three canopy heights for 2011 showed good agreement between measured and predicted psi(stem) and psi(leaf) (R-2 ranged from 0.70 to 0.98).

A two-component (labile and refractory organic C) parallel first-order model was fitted to CO2 evolution rates from top- and subsoil, incubated at different combinations of temperature (constant -4, 0.3, 5, 15, 25, weekly fluctuating between -4 and +5 degrees C) and moisture (17, 26, 36 and 50% H2O for the topsoil and 16, 23, 31 and 41% for the subsoil) and to the evolution of CO2 after the addition of roots or stubble of Phalaris arundinacea in the topsoil, measured at 25 degrees C and 36% H2O (Lomander et al., 1998). The size of the pools and their respective first-order rate constants were optimized simultaneously by a least-squares method. The optimization was carried out separately for top- and subsoil. Quadratic functions were fitted to the temperature and moisture responses. For topsoil samples in which roots or stubble were added, a three-component model (labile, refractory and stubble or roots) was used. The initial partitioning of the soil C, the decomposition rate constants for each partition and the temperature and moisture responses were all assumed to be identical to those of pure topsoil, while the initial pool sizes of added roots and straw were measured. The calculated temperature at which CO2 evolution ceased (T-min) was -0.83 degrees C, and a recalculation to Q(10)-values resulted in increasing temperature response with decreasing temperature (Q(10)=22 at 25 degrees C and 12.7 at 0.3 degrees C). Simulated CO2 evolution rates agreed well with the measurements (R-adj(2) = 0.96 and 0.81) for top- and subsoil, respectively. The multi-compartment approach was superior to the single-compartment approach, which gave R-adj(2) = 0.88 and 0.76 for top- and subsoil, respectively. In general, CO2 evol ution rates obtained from the laboratory experiment were higher than those measured in the field; even after differences in temperature and moisture were taken into account. After 300 d in the laboratory at 25 degrees C and 36% H2O. 99% and 86% of the added straw and roots, respectively, had disappeared according to the described model.

The holistic outdoor-substrate-indoor vertical temperature profile is evaluated. Control, Sedum and Peanut experimental plots were established on a residential building in Hong Kong, each equipped with temperature sensors at 7-11 vertical positions. On summer sunny day, Control plot displays conspicuous daytime heating at roof surface and 15 cm and 150 cm above it. Indoor air and ceiling temperatures with <2 degrees C diurnal range indicates effective dampening by building heat-sink effect. Sedum roof displays a vertical thermal sequence: 15 cm > soil > Sedum surface > drainage > 150 cm > tile. Sedum surface is heated to a maximum of 35.4 degrees C, merely 1-2 degrees C lower than adjacent soil and 15 cm air, indicating daytime CAM stomata closure to restrict transpiration cooling. Contrary to expectation, sensible heat stored in Sedum roof generates green-roof heat-sink effect (GHE), driving downward heat flux throughout the day to raise indoor temperature by 1-2 degrees C. Peanut plot's vertical thermal sequence is: 150 cm > 15 cm > soil > rockwool > Peanut surface > drainage > tile. Peanut surface is significantly cooled by C3 transpiration to 28.8 degrees C, and it remains the coolest among outdoor positions throughout the day. Slightly less heat than Sedum is fluxed downwards to raise indoor temperature. Cooling due to effective C3 transpiration and thicker vegetation and substrate layers is offset by more intensified GHE. The green roofs demonstrate opposite proximal thermal impact which is limited to near-ground (15 cm) air, with warming at Sedum but cooling at Peanut. Both vegetated plots show less heat ingress into indoor space in daytime, but more in nighttime. On summer cloudy and rainy days, both green roofs with GHE brought more heat flux to indoor space throughout the day. Contrary to findings outside the tropics, the tropical extensive green roofs cannot bring net cooling to indoor environment in summer. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Mitotic arrest deficiency 1 (MAD1) is a key component of spindle assembly checkpoint, which was reported to regulate floral transition in Arabidopsis through the interaction with Suppressor of FRIGIDA 4 (SUF4) to modulate Flowering Locus C (FLC) transcription. So far, no MAD1, SUF4 and FLC ho-mologous genes, and related studies were reported in chrysanthemum. Here we first isolated and clone ClMAD1 and ClSUF4 homologs in Chrysanthemum lav-andulifolium. Both ClMAD1 and ClSUF4 localized in nuclei, and their expression varied in different tissues. Overexpression of ClMAD1 in Arabidopsis promoted endopolyploidization in leaves, and restored cell cycle and flowering phenotypes of mad1 mutants to different extents. Overexpression of ClSUF4 in Arabidopsis resulted in significantly late flowering, which was correlated with enhanced transcription of FLC and reduced transcription of FT gene. ClMAD1 was predicted to have three coiled-coil (CC) domains, which is one more than that in Arabidopsis. Similar to AtSUF4, ClSUF4 was predicted to have two Zn-C2H2 domains. Protein-protein interaction assays revealed that ClSUF4 could interact with AtMAD1, and the third coiled-coil domain of ClMAD1 not the full-length protein. All these data suggest that both ClMAD1 and ClSUF4 are functional homologs. We further isolated their downstream signaling component ClFLC-like (ClFLCl) genes. ClFLCl had high expression in leaves at vegetative growth stage, and significantly reduced after the bolting suggesting a negative role in the floral transition. Long-term cold treatment significantly repressed the transcription of ClFLCl genes. Temperature shift promoted floral transition of chrysanthemum, which is correlated with the fluctuation of ClMAD1, ClSUF4 and ClFLCl transcription. Taken together, we reported a novel machinery on the regulation of floral transition in chrysanthemum that ClMAD1 interacts with ClSUF4 to modulate ClFLCl-mediated floral transition during the temperature shift.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0098-8472,1873-7307,,,,FEB,2022,194,,,,,,,,104720,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.104720,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2021.104720,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000760342300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

We were able to attribute 20-30% of the variation in the behavior to genetic variation among individuals, but sources of the remaining variation were unknown. We hypothesized that barometric pressure was a possible environmental source of variation because pressure is associated with weather changes which may affect the success of dispersing mites. Over 30 days we examined initiation of aerial dispersal in mites from a population whose aerial dispersal behavior was well known to us. We recorded 3 weather-related variables at the start and end of each daily test: barometric pressure, relative humidity, and temperature. Relative humidity varied very little (21-35%) and did not affect either incidence or latency of aerial dispersal behavior. The temperature range was also Limited (26.5-29 degrees C), but temperature alone explained about 25% of the daily variation in the proportion showing the behavior. The range of barometric pressure during the experiment (953-984 mb) was similar to that which occurs in nature when mites are active (ca. 960-990 mb). However, barometric pressure alone accounted for only 17% of daily variation in incidence. Furthermore, a model of barometric pressure and temperature explained only 5% more variation than one using temperature alone. Neither temperature nor barometric pressure per se affected latency, but changes in barometric pressure did; short latency (i.e., early dispersal) was associated with rising barometric pressure. Rising barometric pressure is often associated with local upward air movement and clearing weather. We suggest that twospotted spider mites initiate aerial dispersal in response to cues that signal weather favorable for dispersal from deteriorating habitats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-8567,,,,,OCT,1994,67,4,,,,,386,393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994QJ15500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, in order to predict the effects of grazing on complex interacting soil processes and plant production, an integrated approach is needed. We hypothesized that grazing accelerates nutrient cycling by increasing (i) soil temperature and fluctuations, (ii) water-holding capacity, and (iii) forage quality. To test this biological hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment simulating grazing abandonment conditions in semi-natural mountain grassland plots. Our results show that grazing accelerates soil processes through all three hypothesized mechanisms. Since grazing maintains a thin organic layer that provides less insulation to the soil, higher mean temperatures and large daily temperature fluctuations were recorded in grazed areas (less insulated); these daily fluctuations were as large as seasonal variation in the ungrazed plots. The response of the soil water content to grazing was complex. Although overall exclusion reduced the soil water content, particularly in coarse-textured soils, this trend was reversed during long periods of high solar radiation (i.e. high evaporation). Forage quality was reduced in all plots when grazers were excluded. Experiments attempting to realistically simulate grazing may benefit from these findings, particularly in very productive grasslands where the thickness of the organic layer increases rapidly under grazing exclusion.

The first objective was to validate model results against observations. This was restricted somewhat by the narrow range of soil moisture variations during the 11 days of the simulation. In addition some discrepancies were observed between total evaporation as calculated from neutron probe measurements and micrometeorological ones. However, because the SiSPAT results were more in agreement with evaporation calculated from soil water balance, it was assumed that the model could be used as a tool to investigate the mechanisms of the water movement and evaporation within the soil under such dry conditions. In the first 25 cm of soil, vapour flux is the most important transfer term, and the evaporation front (change of phase from liquid to vapour) can be localized at this depth. The contribution of temperature gradients to mass Bur is also found to be important, and tends to lower the total evaporation at the surface by creating a downward vapour flux component which partly cancels the upward one induced by large matric potential gradients at the soil surface.

A rapid electronic nose technique was used to monitor different classes of compounds, representing microbial metabolites that were characteristic for the onset of spoilage odors. Photobacterium phosphoreum predominated among the spoilage bacteria and high levels of TVB-N were observed at sensory rejection. Pseudomonas spp. appeared to be responsible for the development of sweet, fruity spoilage odors in haddock fillets coinciding with increasing response of the electronic nose CO sensor. H2S-producing bacteria, most likely Shewanella putrefaciens, were associated with the H2S sensor's response at abusive temperature conditions. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) was used as an explorative tool to provide a better understanding of the spoilage potential of SSOs, by evaluating models based on electronic nose responses and counts of specific spoilage organisms to predict sensory quality (Torry scores). The best prediction of the sensory quality was obtained by PLSR models based on five variables: the electronic nose sensors (CO, NH3 and H2S), pseudomonads counts and a time-temperature variable.

Drought stress is one of the main limiting factors in the wheat-producing regions; therefore, wheat yield stability is a major objective of wheat-breeding programs in Jordan, which experience fluctuating climatic conditions in the context of global climate change. In the current study, a two-year field experiment was conducted for exploring the effect of four different water regimes on the yield, yield components, and stability of three wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; T. durum Desf.) Jordanian cultivars as related to Canopy Temperature Depression (CTD), and Chlorophyll Content (measured by Soil-Plant Analysis Development, SPAD).

Water treatment was applied as the main factor: with and without supplemental irrigation; 0%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of field capacity were applied. Two durum wheat cultivars and one bread wheat cultivar were split over irrigation treatments as a sub factor. In both growing seasons, supplemental irrigation showed a significant increase in grain yield compared to the rain-fed conditions. This increase in grain yield was due to the significantly positive effect of water availability on yield components. Values of CTD, SPAD, harvest index, and water use efficiency (WUE) were increased significantly with an increase in soil moisture and highly correlated with grain yield. Ammon variety produced the highest grain yield across the four water regimes used in this study. This variety was characterized by the least thermal time to maturity and the highest values of CTD and SPAD. It was concluded that Ammon had the highest stability among the cultivars tested.

But the biological effects of an increased night-time temperature combined with high daytime temperature are unclear. We used six thermal regimens to simulate NTs on hot days and investigated the effects of night warming on life-history traits of the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. Experimental temperatures fluctuated in continuous diurnal cycles, increasing from 27 degrees C to a maximum 35 degrees C and then declining to 27 degrees C gradually before further dropping to different minima (13, 16, 19, 21, 23 or 25 degrees C) representing NTs. When compared to expectations based on constant temperatures, night warming raised the optimum temperature for development by 3 degrees C, in contrast to results from experiments where temperature variability was altered symmetrically or in a parallel manner. Night warming also reduced aphid survival under heat from 75% to 37% and depressed adult performance by up to 50%. Overall, night warming exacerbated the detrimental effects of hot days on the intrinsic rate of population increase, which was predicted to drop by 30% when night-time minimum temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C.

And the high temperature resistant pH electrode was used to monitor the pH variation during pectin extraction. The results showed that the pH of pectin extraction solution was not constant during pectin extraction, and the pH of extraction solution fluctuated more widely at 85 degrees C than at 75 degrees C. In the experiment design, the initial pH was the most significant factor on pectin composition such as arabinose, total neutral sugars, and degree of acetylation, while the temperature became the most important factor for yield, galacturonic acid, rhamnose, galactose, and weight-average molar mass. The degree of methoxylation was significantly affected by extraction time. It was observed that the emulsifying properties of the extracted pectin samples were significantly affected by the extraction conditions. All the results revealed that 1.) the pH value of extraction solution is directly related to the yield and the degradation of the extracted pectin during sugar beet pectin extraction, 2.) the extraction temperature could significantly affect the pH fluctuation of extraction liquid, 3.) the most significant effect factor for a given pectin composition is dominated by the pH fluctuation of the extracting liquid and acid stability of this discussional pectin composition, 4.) beet pectin extracted by citric acid is an effective emulsifier.

Plasticity has been studied extensively in recent years, leading to an accumulation of evidence for behavioural plasticity within natural populations. Despite the recent attention given to studying individual variation in behavioural plasticity, there is still a lack of consensus regarding its causes and constraints. One pressing question related to this is whether individual plasticity carries over across temporal and environmental gradients. That is, are some individuals more plastic (responsive) than others in general? Here, we examined the influence of temporal and environmental gradients on individual behavioural responses in a marine gastropod, Littoraria irrorata. We measured individual boldness repeatedly over time and in response to tidal cycle (high vs. low, an index of risk) and daily temperature fluctuations (known to affect metabolism), in a controlled field experiment. On average, boldness increased from high to low tide and with increasing temperature but decreased marginally over time. Individuals also differed in their responses to variation in tide and temperature, but not over time. Those which were relatively bold at high tide (when predation risk is greater) were similarly bold at low tide, whereas shy individuals became much more bold at low tide. Most notably, individuals that were more responsive to tide (and thus risk) were also more responsive to temperature changes, indicating that plasticity was correlated across contexts (r=0.57) and that bolder individuals were least plastic overall. This study provides a rare and possibly first example of consistency of individual behavioural plasticity across contexts, suggesting underlying physiology as a common mechanism, and raises the possibility of correlational selection on plasticity.",,,,,,"Biro, Peter/0000-0002-3565-240X; Snyder, Richard/0000-0002-3787-9376; McCarthy, Ian/0000-0002-5254-7177",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,APR,2019,88,4,,,,,511,520,,10.1111/1365-2656.12935,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12935,,,,,,,,30516829,,,,,WOS:000467994800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

These models were developed for a wide range of fish sizes from various geographic origins and have been used to generate predictions for fish across the entire size and geographic ranges of largemouth bass. Although previous studies have shown general validity in model predictions, no validation has been achieved for smaller-bodied largemouth bass from differing geographic populations. To test the accuracy of a commonly used model at predicting the growth of small largemouth bass, we ran a series of six 14-d aquarium experiments that included controlled feeding rates over the range of average daily water temperature regimes in central Alabama. Age-0 largemouth bass from one population in Wisconsin (northern largemouth bass M. s. salmoides) and two population in Alabama (Florida largemouth bass M. s. floridanus and northern largemouth bass) were fed at two ration levels, and the actual amount consumed over the 14 d was used to predict growth, which was compared with observed growth. Survival was similar among populations and decreased at higher temperatures. The bioenergetics model inaccurately predicted the growth of age-0 largemouth bass for all three populations. The bias associated with model predictions increased with temperature. Additionally, model predictions were more accurate for the Florida subspecies than for the northern subspecies throughout the temperature ranges covered in our experiments. These results suggest that differences in body size and source population may influence the relative accuracy of growth predictions by the current model.

Mechanisms that reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of DTFs. Species that experience varying degrees of DTFs in their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to DTFs, tadpoles from habitats characterised by small DTFs would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large DTFs. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24 degrees C) and DTF treatments (20-30 degrees C and 18-38 degrees C). DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats (similar to 15%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats (similar to 30%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although DTFs induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6 degrees C).

In this study, FT was analyzed in three sweet persimmons cultivars, 'Fuyu', 'Taishuu', and 'Romang', using an electrolyte leakage method for two successive years (Year 1, November 2017 to April 2018; Year 2, November 2018 to April 2019). Current-year shoot samples from 8-year-old sweet persimmon trees of each cultivar were collected to analyze FT in an experimental orchard (Pear Research Station, Naju, Korea). Average daily air temperatures increasingly declined from November 2017, reaching the minimum in mid-January 2018. They then steadily increased until April 2018 (Year 1). Patterns of average daily air temperatures of Year 2 were similar to those of Year 1 except that they reached the minimum at the end of December 2018. FT of the three cultivars constantly increased during cold acclimation (from November to January), whereas FT decreased during deacclimation (from February to April) for both years. Shoot samples (from Year 2) of the most freezing-tolerant 'Romang' and the most freezing-susceptible 'Taishuu' were used for soluble sugar analysis with HPLC. In both 'Taishuu' and 'Romang', total soluble sugar content was the highest in December 2018 and started to decrease from January 2019 until April 2019. Fructose and glucose contents showed the same pattern as total soluble sugar. Meanwhile, sucrose and maltose of 'Taishuu' and 'Romang' were detected minimally throughout the whole experimental period.

It overwinters as an adult. During winter in northern European countries, such as Estonia, it is subject to sometimes severe temperatures that may fluctuate daily, over the season, and between seasons. The objective of this study was to investigate factors that affect its cold hardiness. In a series of five experiments, the effects of food plant, starvation, and acclimatization on the beetles' ability to supercool and survive exposure to sub-zero temperatures was investigated. The supercooling points (SCP) of overwintered beetles field-collected from white mustard and Indian mustard differed from those caught from white cabbage and oilseed rape, but these differences disappeared after a 4-day period of starvation at room temperature, indicating that gut content probably influences the potential to supercool. The duration and temperature of acclimation affected SCP in overwintered beetles. The decrease in SCP was more rapid at 22 degrees C than at 0 degrees C, probably because of faster dehydration and gut evacuation at the higher temperature. Acclimation at 0 degrees C for a week increased the ability of overwintered beetles to survive sub-zero temperatures, lowering both SCP and lower lethal temperature (LLT50). Some pre-freeze mortality occurred; SCP and LLT50 were correlated but the latter was a constant 3 degrees C higher than the former. The SCP of field-collected pre-winter beetles decreased gradually during the autumn. It also decreased when field-collected pre-winter beetles were acclimated at 0 degrees C in the laboratory, attaining its lowest level after 18 days.

The present study tests the hypothesis that, during embryogenesis, temperature and photoperiod influence pre- and post-eyespot development time in dragonflies of the family Libellulidae differently. Eggs are used from eight species ( five different genera, from Africa/Europe, and lentic/lotic habitat preferences). The eggs are reared under different constant or fluctuating temperature and light conditions. There are no general species-specific degree-days for pre- or the post-eyespot development in these species. In all study species, the variance within and between the treatments of the duration in days and the degree-days of pre-eyespot development is lower than that of post-eyespot development. Pre-eyespot development appears to be less flexible in its reaction to environmental influences. By contrast, post-eyespot development appears to react more flexibly to environmental influences. All eight species show the same pattern. This indicates strongly that this flexibility is a general pattern in Libellulidae that might help the species within this family to cope successfully with variations in environmental conditions. Because eyespot development and katatrepsis occur close to each other, the above-described pattern might also appear in other odonates and in other insect groups that exhibit katatrepsis.

Crucial issues include: (i) the magnitude of effects elicited by thermal regimes in natural nests (as opposed to constant-temperature incubation) (ii) the persistence of these effects during ontogeny; and (iii) the consistency of these effects across different test conditions (does the thermal regime during embryogenesis simply shift the hatchling's thermal optimum for performance, or actually modify overall performance ability regardless of temperature?). We examined these questions by incubating eggs of scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) from montane southeastern Australia, under two fluctuating-temperature regimes that simulated 'cold' and 'hot' natural nests. These thermal regimes substantially modified hatchling morphology (mass, body length, tail length, and the relationship between these variables), locomotor performance (running speeds over distances of 25 cm and 1 m), antipredator 'tactics' and survival rates. The differences in locomotor performance persisted throughout the 20 weeks of our experiment. Lizards that emerged after 'hot' incubation were faster runners than their 'cold'-incubated siblings under all thermal conditions that we tested. Thus, incubation temperatures modified overall locomotor ability, with only a minor effect on the set-point for optimum performance. The magnitude, persistence and consistency of these incubation-induced phenotypic modifications suggest that they may play an important role in evolutionary and ecological processes within lizard populations.

In general, the effect of temperature contributed more significantly to mortality in PL 10 and PL 30, but its influence decreased afterwards. From PL, 40, salinity becomes the main factor determining mortality.

An increase in the salinity tolerance was observed from PL 15 to 30, even with no acclimation. Results indicate that PL 10 do not have a fully developed osmoregulatory capacity to cope with low and/or abrupt changes of salinity. It is recommended that non-acclimated PL 10 should only be released in environments with salinity at or above 20 pot. If acclimation is carried out, PL may be released in salinities above 10 ppt. The release of PL 10 in salinities below 5 ppt may result in mortality rates of up to 70%.

The algorithm follows the standard Monin-Obukhov similarity approach for near-surface meteorological measurements but includes separate models for the ocean's cool skin and the diurnal warm layer, which are used to derive true skin temperature from the bulk temperature measured at some depth near the surface. The basic structure is an outgrowth of the Liu-Katsaros-Businger [Liu et at, 1979] method, with modifications to include a different specification of the roughness/stress relationship, a gustiness velocity to account for the additional flux induced by boundary layer scale variability, and profile functions obeying the convective limit. Additionally, we have considered the contributions of the sensible heat carried by precipitation and the requirement that the net dry mass flux be zero (the so-called Webb correction [Webb et at, 1980]).

These measurements yielded 1622 fifty-min averages of fluxes and bulk variables in the wind speed range from 0.5 to 10 m s(-1). The analysis gives statistically reliable values for the Charnock [1955] constant (beta = 0.011) and the gustiness parameter (beta = 1.25). An overall mean value for the latent heat flux, neutral bulk-transfer coefficient was 1.11 x 10(-3), declining slightly with increasing wind speed. Mean values for the sensible and latent heat fluxes were 9.1 and 103.5 W m(-2); mean values for the Webb and rain heat fluxes were 2.5 and 4.5 W m(-2). Accounting for all factors, the net surface heat transfer to the ocean was 17.9 +/- 10 W m(-2).",,,,,"Bradley, Frank/I-6574-2013; fairall, christopher/G-5970-2019","fairall, christopher/0000-0003-4073-7413",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,FEB 15,1996,101,C2,,,,,3747,3764,,10.1029/95JC03205,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95JC03205,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996TW39000021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Particular attention is paid to one of the subbasins of Clear Lake (Oaks Arm). Several field experiments were conducted in the lake to obtain data of wind, currents, and water temperature using a wide range of devices. Based on field observations and previously published results on basin responses to wind stress, a conceptual model of the internal circulation of the Oaks Arm is proposed. Its internal dynamics are characterized by diurnal cycles of setup and relaxation of horizontal temperature gradients driven by the wind forcing. The setup and relaxation processes are modulated by the influence of the earth's rotation and mate a residual cyclonic circulation. This circulation mechanism is here referred to as baroclinic pumping. It is in all likelihood not exclusive to Clear Lake but probably exists in other large and relatively shallow lakes forced by strong and almost periodic wind events where basin-scale internal waves do not play a major role in the dynamics of the system.",,,,,"Rueda, Francisco J/N-3145-2016","Rueda, Francisco J/0000-0002-2803-3440; Monismith, Stephen/0000-0002-7388-3313",,,,,,,,,,,,,0733-9429,1943-7900,,,,FEB,2003,129,2,,,,,82,91,,10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2003)129:2(82),http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2003)129:2(82),,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000180481000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Surprisingly, C. bombycina has comparatively shorter legs than its well-studied sister species Cataglyphis fortis from salt pan habitats. This holds despite the somewhat hotter surface temperatures and the more yielding sand substrate. Here, we report that C. bombycina employs a different strategy in reaching high running speeds, outperforming the fastest known runs of the longer-legged C. fortis ants. Video analysis across a broad range of locomotor speeds revealed several differences to C. fortis. Shorter leg lengths are compensated for by high stride frequencies, ranging beyond 40 Hz. This is mainly achieved by a combination of short stance phases (down to 7 ms) and fast leg swing movements (up to 1400 mm s(-1)). The legs of one tripod group exhibit almost perfect synchrony in the timings of their lift-offs and touchdowns, and good tripod coordination is present over the entire walking speed range (tripod coordination strength values around 0.8).

We ask: is the divergent species origin response due to fundamental differences in germination cues and/or safe -sites for establishment? Location Temperate grassy woodlands, southern Victoria, Australia. Methods We quantified patch type frequency in the field. Diurnal temperature effects on four native annual forbs and three exotic annual grasses were assessed in a laboratory germination trial. We used a glasshouse experiment to assess the effects of patch type (bare ground, tree litter, grass litter, moss mat) on the emergence and growth of two native and two exotic annuals. Results Exotic annuals typically had higher and more rapid germination across a wider range of diurnal temperatures than native annuals. Emergence of native and exotic annuals was highest on bare ground patches but was suppressed by leaf litter and moss mat. Native annuals did not emerge from under a moss mat and germinated much less than exotics in all patch types. Seedling growth of native annuals was suppressed by tree litter whereas growth of exotic species was not suppressed by litter or the moss mat. Conclusions The regeneration niche of the native annual forb species we examined was typically narrower than that of exotic annual grasses. Many of the differences in response between native and exotic species may be due to seed traits such as seed mass; native annuals have much smaller seeds than exotic annual species. This likely affects the persistence, germination cues, co-existence and restoration potential of native annuals in fragmented grassy woodlands that have lost their endogenous disturbance agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1402-2001,1654-109X,,,,OCT,2020,23,4,,,,,575,585,,10.1111/avsc.12506,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.12506,,JUL 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000551595900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is particularly important in boreal forests, which often have large C pools in the forest floor and mineral horizons. We examined the effects of temperature and precipitation frequency on C dynamics in forest floor horizons from eight red spruce sites in the northeastern U.S. using column leaching experiments. Intact and sieved forest floor samples were incubated at 3, 10 or 20 degrees C and leached either daily, once per week, or twice per week during 14 to 39 days using simulated throughfall solutions (pH 2.7 or 4.0). Leachate DOC and CO2 production were measured along with soil C and N concentrations. For intact samples, losses of C as DOC and as CO2 increased with increasing temperature, and the increase (Q(10)) was usually greater between 3 and 10 degrees C than between 10 and 20 degrees C. There was a greater response of CO2 to temperature than of DOC (e.g. Howland sieved soil Q(10)s of 1.9 and 7.2 for CO2 and 1.5 and 2.0 for DOC at 3-10 and 10-20 degrees C ranges, respectively). More frequent leaching increased steady state DOC mobilization (e.g. 145 and 58 mu g g(-1) forest floor d(-1) for daily and weekly leachings at 10 degrees C, respectively), but not CO2 evolution (e.g. 79 and 74 mu g CO2-C g(-1) forest floor d(-1) for daily and weekly leachings at 10 degrees C, respectively). Across the eight sites DOC loss and CO2 evolution varied by factors of 3.6 and 4.0, respectively. Both CO2 evolution and DOC in leachates calculated as fluxes were correlated (r = 0.73 and 0.87 respectively, n = 8) with the C-to-N ratios of the samples (C-to-N ratios ranged from 27 to 58), which could be explained by N limitations that triggered selective lignin degradation, differences in degree of humification of the material, or position on a west-to-east pollution gradient. Although higher temperatures and more frequent leaching increased DOC mobilization, and higher temperatures increased CO? evolution, both treatments and site to site variation illustrate the complexity of the response of forest-floor C pools to manipulations.

Field experiments were conducted at three locations with numerous times of planting so that a broad range of environments were encountered. Models of daily rate of development for the period sowing to kernel maturity (720 g kg-1 moisture) were derived by an iterative optimization procedure. Development rate was related to mean daily temperature and photoperoid. Temperature was the most important factor affecting rate of development. The temperature response was best described by a broken linear function. Various photoperiod functions fitted as multipliers to the temperature response did not improve goodness-of-fit. Cultivars were classified into three maturity groups based on analysis of covariance. Developmental characteristics appeared independent of genetic background as the response of the three sh, cultivars was not significantly different from a tropical su type, and the se cultivar 'Sweet Champion' did not differ significantly from the majority of su types. Only su cultivar 'Terrific' differed significantly from both of these groups. Base temperatures (range from 5.4-6.4-degrees-C) were lower than the value traditionally quoted for sweet corn (10-degrees-C).

However, facultative C3/CAM metabolism in the first 2 months of growth is a characteristic of this species. Thus, young pineapple plants can exhibit C-3 photosynthesis when the environmental conditions, such as the diurnal temperature range and water supply, are favorable to growth. However, high temperature diurnal amplitude, soil/air moisture alterations and changes in light intensity in association with air humidity have caused facultative C-3/CAM metabolism. The objective of the study was to assess the physiology and growth of ex vitro `Vitoria' and ` IAC Fantastico' pineapple genotypes during acclimatization from the in vitro environment. The research was carried out in a greenhouse using the split plot design used in the in vitro culture (Couto et al, Rev Bras Frutic 36(2): 459-466, 2014).

The greater growth (canopy diameter and height, shoot dry mass, total dry mass and leaf area) of ` IAC Fantastico' was associated with CAM metabolism. CAM metabolism was likely induced by the stressful environmental micrometeorological variables inside the greenhouse. In contrast, 'Vitoria' exhibited C-3 metabolism and reduced growth at 60 and 75 DA. 'Vitoria' had greater photosynthate partitioning to the root system and high photochemical efficiency 75 DA.

We propose a model based on the concept of stratification thermal time to predict changes in the fraction of the seed population that would germinate as a function of the number of fluctuating temperature cycle-doses. Results showed that stratification at cool temperatures produced higher rates of change than stratification at warmer temperatures. Construction of response curves with a thermal time scale was possible because seeds that had accumulated similar stratification thermal time achieved similar germination percentages in response to cycle-doses of fluctuating temperatures. The model was tested against independent experimental data yielding good agreement between predicted and observed data. Overall, this constitutes an important tool to overcome dormancy in a way that should result in a more efficient and faster production of kiwifruit seedlings or rootstocks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-4238,1879-1018,,,,FEB 5,2021,277,,,,,,,,109796,10.1016/j.scienta.2020.109796,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.109796,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000595882600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

To calculate economic thresholds, population growth parameters under varied temperature conditions are needed. However, detailed laboratory studies of temperature effects on the biology and population parameters of M. sacchari since the sorghum outbreak in the US have not been performed previously. Therefore, this study evaluated the response of M. sacchari to 6 different constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 32, and 35 degrees C) on sorghum tissue. Aphid development, age-specific survivorship, fecundity, and longevity were compared at the mentioned temperatures. At 20 degrees C, the reproductive period was longest and total fecundity was greatest. Development time of M. sacchari was shortest at 25 and 30 C. Intrinsic rate of increase was highest at 25 degrees C (r(m) = 0.405 +/- 0.030). Net reproductive rate (R-0) was highest at 20 degrees C, and age-specific survivorship decreased with increasing temperature. At 25 degrees C, aphid populations doubled in 1.7 d, the shortest among all temperatures tested. Using a modification of the nonlinear Logan model, the lower and upper developmental thresholds of M. sacchari were calculated at 8.6 and 37.8 degrees C, respectively, with the optimum temperature for development occurring at 28.3 degrees C.

A natural variability was superimposed on a linear warming trend due to the increasing radiative forcing of CO2. The result demonstrates that the superposition of the natural variability and the background linear trend can offset with each other to show the warming hiatus for some period. It is also stressed that the rapid warming during 1970-2000 can be explained by the superposition of the natural variability and the background linear trend at least within the simple model. The key process of the fluctuating planetary albedo in multi-decadal time scale is investigated using the JRA-55 reanalysis data. It is found that the planetary albedo increased for 1958-1970, decreased for 1970-2000, and increased for 2000-2012, as expected by the simple EBM experiments. The multidecadal variability in the planetary albedo is compared with the time series of the AO mode and Barents Sea mode of surface air temperature. It is shown that the recent AO negative pattern showing warm Arctic and cold mid-latitudes is in good agreement with planetary albedo change indicating negative anomaly in high latitudes and positive anomaly in mid -latitudes. Moreover, the Barents Sea mode with the warm Barents Sea and cold mid -latitudes shows long-term variability similar to planetary albedo change. Although further studies are needed, the natural variabilities of both the AO mode and Barents Sea mode indicate some possible link to the planetary albedo as suggested by the simple EBM to cause the warming hiatus in recent years.

These inactive tributaries of the Gangotri glacier contribute significantly to the proglacial discharge, which is dominantly controlled by air temperature (0-20 degrees C at the measurement site) rather than rainfall (117 mm from June to September 2008). The breakthrough flow velocities, ranging from 0.6 to 1.7 ms(-1) and dispersivity values varying between 2.1 and 17.5 m, decreased with bulk discharges in the proglacial stream (R-2 = 0.66), indicating flow through highly efficient subglacial channels that develop during the melt season with increased meltwater influx. However, the dye return curves giving high velocities in a narrow range from 1.3 to 1.7 ms(-1) as seasonal discharges were peaking, are interpreted as indicative of flow through pressurized channel/s. In general, the subglacial channels routing meltwater from these input points are arguably controlled by recharge hydrographs rather than channel geometry during the ablation season. Closely spaced dye tests need to be carried out to better understand the factors that control the diurnal and seasonal development of these hydrological pathways, which are important for downstream water management.",,,,,"AL, Ramanathan -/E-7217-2012","AL, Ramanathan -/0000-0002-3491-2273; Singh, Virendra/0000-0002-4819-8330; Pottakkal, Jose/0000-0001-9218-8044",,,,,,,,,,,,,0011-3891,,,,,AUG 25,2014,107,4,,,,,613,621,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000345616700017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature is one of the most important factors influencing host-fungus associations but the effects of temperature variability on disease development are rarely examined. The chytrid pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has had severe effects on populations of hundreds of rainforest-endemic amphibian species but we know little about the effects of rainforest-specific host body temperature cycles on infection patterns. To address this challenge, we used body temperature regimes experienced in nature by frogs in the Australian Wet Tropics to guide a controlled experiment investigating the effects of body temperature fluctuations on infection patterns in a model host (Litoria spenceri), with emphasis on exposing frogs to realistic heat pulses that only marginally exceed the thermal optimum of the fungus. We then exposed cultured Bd to an expanded array of heat pulse treatments and measured parameters of population growth to help resolve the role of host immunity in our in vivo results. Infections developed more slowly in frogs exposed to daily 4-hr heat pulses of 26 degrees C or 29 degrees C than in frogs in constant temperature treatments without heat pulses (control). Frogs that experienced heat pulses were also less likely to exceed infection intensities at which morbidity and mortality become likely. Ten of 11 (91%) frogs from the daily 29 degrees C heat pulse treatment even cleared their infections after approximately 9weeks. Cultured Bd also grew more slowly when exposed to heat pulses than in constant-temperature control treatments, suggesting that mild heat pulses have direct negative effects on Bd growth in nature, but precluding us from determining whether there was a concurrent benefit of heat pulses to host immunity. Our results suggest that even in habitats where average temperatures may be suitable for fungal growth and reproduction, infection risk or the outcome of existing infections may be heavily influenced by short but frequent exposures to temperatures that only slightly exceed the optimum for the fungus. Our findings provide support for management interventions that promote warm microenvironments for hosts, such as small-scale removal of branches overhanging critical habitat or provision of artificial heat sources.

With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, there are plenty of studies for SST prediction with deep learning to pursue better prediction performance and normalization was used for most studies. However, SST always fluctuates widely, so the denormalization scaled up the difference between normalized observed SSTs and normalized predicted SSTs (OnP-DIFF), and it results in a significant decline in the prediction performance. Therefore, a revision method used to revert the scale-up is proposed in this letter. This method uses cube B-spline interpolation to enhance OnP-DIFF, utilizes Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) to train and predict OnP-DIFF and generate revision tensor (RT), and finally uses RT to revise denormalized predicted SSTs. To our knowledge, it is the first attempt to use the revision method to solve the problem of performance decline for SST prediction because of wide fluctuations of SST. The experiment results indicate that the proposed method can revert the performance back to and even better than the value before denormalization for deep learning models, significantly improving the prediction performance, and is reliable for SST prediction with high performance for a wide time range and large spatial scope.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-704X,2150-7058,,,,FEB 1,2022,13,2,,,,,173,183,,10.1080/2150704X.2021.2005269,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2021.2005269,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000731175500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most stocks of small pelagic species are characterized by natural, fishery-independent fluctuations, which make it difficult to predict stock development. Baltic sprat recruitment is highly variable, which can partly be related to climate-driven variability in hydrographic conditions. Results from experimental studies and field observations demonstrate that a number of important life history traits of sprat are affected by temperature, especially the survival and growth of early life stages. Projected climate-driven warming may impact important processes affecting various life stages of sprat, from survival and development during the egg and larval phases to the reproductive output of adults. This study presents a stage-based matrix model approach to simulate sprat population dynamics in relation to different climate change scenarios. Data obtained from experimental studies and field observations were used to estimate and incorporate stage-specific growth and survival rates into the model.

An extension was added to the model to predict E. coli O157:H7 growth due to temperature abuses in a cold storage facility. A user-friendly interface was created to follow variations in model outputs. The number of contaminated bags and lettuce contamination levels were computed and visualized. Experimental data of cross-contamination from literature was used to describe the facility and validate the model. The key factor affecting cross-contamination in the process is the free chlorine (FC) concentration dose rate. The number of contaminated bags per batch decreases nonlinearly as FC is added to the flume tank. The contamination level in the shredded lettuces increases linearly with initial microbial load or the initial contamination probability on lettuce heads. Both the level and probability of contamination in the facility's environment alter the number of contaminated bags. Batch size influences the number of contaminated bags when the first incoming lettuce batch is contaminated. The smaller the batch size the smaller number of contaminated bags. Storage room temperature fluctuations (13 and 19 degrees C and 8 and 12 degrees C) show the importance of real-time monitoring to avoid pathogen growth and number of contaminated bags. This work provides insight on applications of agent-based modeling approach using NetLogo to visualize cross-contamination in fresh-cut leafy green processing operations. It analyzes cross-contamination and its impact on processing performance by studying the effect of mitigation strategies. Practical applications To support ready-to-eat leafy greens postharvest operations, this work investigated the benefits of using visualization to develop strategies to prevent produce cross-contamination along processing and the effect of temperature abuse during storage.

An increased production of H2O2 and O-2(center dot-) linked with increased activities of antioxidative enzymes was seen in both CL treatments, but despite of this, leaf injuries were only observed in the CLCT treatment. The results suggest that the diurnal temperature fluctuations alleviated the CL injury symptoms, probably because the diurnal cycles of cellular mechanisms were maintained. The ROS were shown not to be directly involved in CL-induced leaf injury, since both ROS production and scavenging was highest in CLVT without leaf chlorotic symptoms.",,,,,"Haque, Sabibul/AAW-2898-2021; Soares, Cristiano Fortuna/U-8955-2017; Fidalgo, Fernanda/A-7399-2010","Soares, Cristiano Fortuna/0000-0003-3330-2024; Fidalgo, Fernanda/0000-0001-7756-5243; Ottosen, Carl-Otto/0000-0002-9615-4324; HAQUE, MD.

The lowest mean specific oxygen consumption rates (M-O2) were found for the less active benthic crangonids Crangon crangon and Philocheras monacanthus; whereas the highest ones corresponded to the two more mobile native palaemonids Palaemon longirostris and Palaemonetes varians. The level of oxygen regulation displayed by the different native species was mainly related with environmental characteristics of their common habitats: species with temporal (C. crangon) or permanent (P. varians) estuarine habitats tended to be more tolerant of salinity changes and/or hypoxia, than are fully marine (P. monacanthus) or freshwater (Atyaephyra desmarestii) species. The estuarine P. longirostris showed moderate oxygen independence, but rather independent of salinity and temperature fluctuations. The exotic shrimp P. macrodactylus seemed to have higher tolerance to hypoxia that its native counterpart P. longirostris at brackish waters, but only under moderate temperature (at 20 degrees C). Results of this study suggest that a simultaneous evaluation of respiration rates and their dependence on DO could be an integrative way of determining the potential effects of increased salinity, temperature and hypoxia on aquatic species with different mobility and/or from different habitats.

Climate warming can modify this interaction both directly by the kinetic effects of temperature on biological rates and indirectly through integrated behavioural and physiological responses of the predators and prey. Temperature dependence of predation rates can further be altered by predator-induced plasticity of prey locomotor activity, but empirical data about this effect are lacking. We propose a general framework to understand the influence of predator-induced developmental plasticity on behavioural thermal reaction norms in prey and their consequences for predator-prey dynamics. Using a mesocosm experiment with dragonfly larvae (predator) and newt larvae (prey), we tested if the predator-induced plasticity alters the elevation or the slope of the thermal reaction norms for locomotor activity metrics in prey. We also estimated the joint predator-prey thermal response in mean locomotor speed, which determines prey encounter rate, and modelled the effect of both phenomena on predator-prey population dynamics. Thermal reaction norms for locomotor activity in prey were affected by predation risk cues but with minor influence on the joint predator-prey behavioural response. We found that predation risk cues significantly decreased the intercept of thermal reaction norm for total activity rate (i.e. all body movements) but not the other locomotor activity metrics in the prey, and that prey locomotor activity rate and locomotor speed increased with prey density. Temperature had opposite effects on the mean relative speed of predator and prey as individual speed increased with temperature in predators but decreased in prey. This led to a negligible effect of body temperature on predicted prey encounter rates and predator-prey dynamics. The behavioural component of predator-prey interaction varied much more between individuals than with temperature and the presence of predation risk cues in our system. We conclude that within-population variation in locomotor activity can buffer the influence of body temperature and predation risk cues on predator-prey interactions, and further research should focus on the magnitude and sources of behavioural variation in interacting species to predict the impact of climate change on predator-prey interactions and food web dynamics.",,,,,"Boukal, David/H-4762-2014","Boukal, David/0000-0001-8181-7458",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,FEB,2021,90,2,,,,,503,514,,10.1111/1365-2656.13383,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13383,,NOV 2020,,,,,,33159686,,,,,WOS:000590992000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite this, few studies have attempted to synthesize and collate data from this expansive and important body of research. Here, we systematically review research into thermal developmental plasticity across reptiles, structured around the key papers and findings that have shaped the field over the past 50 years.

The aim of this work was to determine the behavior of Enterobacter amnigenus (ATCC 33072 and an isolated cheese strain: LAM 200) and Salmonella typhimurium in Crottin goat's cheese during chill storage and when the cold chain is broken during different time intervals. The inoculated samples were stored in sterile bags at 5 degrees C for 5 days and were later divided into three groups, each with its own treatment: (A) reference (Ref) at 5 degrees C for a maximum period of 40 days; (13) kept along 8 h at 25 degrees C and then taken to 5 degrees C till the end of the experiment; (C) kept along 24 h at 25 degrees C and then taken to 5 degrees C till the end of the experiment. The behavior of the three strains with time in Ref experiments was analyzed with the modified Gompertz nonlinear model. In Ref treatment E. amnigenus LAM 200 did not show a lag phase but grew steadily up to K 8.1 log cfu/g; E. amnigenus ATCC 33072 did show a lag phase (7.35 days), after which it grew up to K 7.68 log cfu/g. S. typhimurium population decreased rapidly during the first 5 days. After that a second inactivation kinetics phase was observed. The behavior of E. amnigenus LAM 200 was not affected by the break in the cold chain. It seems that the cells could adapt to the stresses and fluctuating conditions. On the other hand, E. amnigenus ATCC 33072 suffered a behavior modification, as cells needed some time to acclimatize to the new conditions. The evolution of Salmonella in B treatment closely resembled Ref treatment. On the other hand in the cheese kept along 24 h at 25 degrees C it showed an increase of 2.4 log units after the break in the cold chain; probably as a consequence of the reparation of higher Cellular numbers.

High concentrations Of CO2 in xylem sap ([CO2*]) have 2 been shown to affect EA, and the transport Of CO2 in the xylem stream has been suggested as a mechanism to explain field observations of temperature-independent fluctuations in EA. Sap velocity and temperature were manipulated in detached branch segments of sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.) under controlled conditions to quantity these effects. Within individual branches of similar size, EA and [CO*(2)] were greater at low sa 2 P velocity, while the amount of respired CO2 transported in sap (transport flux, Fr) was greater at high sap velocity. EA was linearly correlated with [CO*(2)]. In 2 branches of three diameter classes (1, 2, and 3 cm), volume-based EA, Fr, and Rs did not differ, but surface-area based CO2 fluxes increased with diameter class. Regardless of diameter, EA accounted for only 30% of respired CO2 at high sap velocity, while at low sap velocity, EA accounted for 71% of respired CO2. EA, Fr, and Rs measured at 5, 20, and 35 degrees C at the same sap velocity showed a typical exponential response to temperature. However, at the lowest temperature, EA accounted for only 18% of the CO2 released from respiring cells compared with 44% at the highest temperature, perhaps due to the effect of temperature on the solubility Of CO2 in water.

Specifically, we studied the persistence of biocontrol activities, spread of BCAs among leaves, and biocontrol efficacy in relation to application regimes: mixed versus single BCA, pre-versus post-inoculation application, and sequential versus simultaneous application. Three BCA products (Sentinel, Serenade and Trianum) were used for this study. Overall, Serenade did not significantly reduce sporulation of B. cinerea on strawberry leaf discs whereas Sentinel and Trianum gave a similar and significant biocontrol efficacy. Biocontrol efficacy remained almost unchanged 10 days after application at 20/20 degrees C (day/night) or 24/16 degrees C temperature regimes. In contrast, reduced biocontrol efficacy at 26/14 degrees C suggests BCA survival was reduced under these conditions. Incidence of B. cinerea sporulation on leaf discs was ca. 60% higher on leaves that emerged after the BCA application than on leaves directly exposed to BCA, indicating insufficient amount of the BCA had managed to spread to new leaves. Combinations of BCAs, whether applied simultaneously or sequentially (48 h apart), did not improve disease control over the most effective BCA within the combination applied alone.

In circumpolar areas where lichens are an important component of boreal and Arctic ecosystems, winter climate is changing, leading to increased frequency of winter thaw and ground-icing events. It is imperative to elucidate in further detail how northern vegetation responds to being encapsulated in ice. A winter icing simulation experiment was therefore undertaken, encapsulating two reindeer lichens (Cladonia stellaris and Cladonia rangiferina) and two epiphytic lichens (Parmeliopsis ambigua and Melanohalea olivacea) in ice at temperatures just below freezing for a maximum period of 98 d. Photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence rates decreased strongly, clearly suggesting that the algal partner of the lichens was dying. Low but detectable respiration rates indicate that the fungal partner maintained some physiological activity. Ethanol accumulated in the lichens during ice encapsulation as a result of anaerobic respiration. The algae probably were dying from a combination of depletion of carbon reserves and toxic levels of ethanol and other stress metabolites. This experiment shows that boreal and Arctic-alpine lichens are sensitive to a warmer and more fluctuating winter climate. Increasing frequency of winter icing events may therefore have extensive and hitherto unknown effects on lichen-dominated ecosystems, their herbivores and the indigenous peoples whose livelihoods largely depend on them.

Although much research has been done on short-term seasonal to annual wetland biogeochemical cycles, there is a lack of experimental evidence concerning how the reversibility of wetland hydrological changes will influence these cycles over longer time periods. Five years of drought-induced declining water table at Lost Creek, a shrub fen wetland in northern Wisconsin, coincided with increased ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross primary production (GPP) as derived from long-term eddy covariance observations. Since then, however, the average water table level at this site has increased, providing a unique opportunity to explore how wetland carbon fluxes are affected by interannual air temperature differences as well as changing water table levels. Water table level, as measured by water discharge, was correlated with R-eco and GPP at interannual time scales. However, air temperature had a strong correlation with R-eco, GPP, and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) at monthly time scales and correlated with NEP at inter-annual time scales. Methane flux was strongly temperature-controlled at seasonal time scales, increasing an order of magnitude from April to July. Annual methane emissions were 51 g C m(-2).

The soil samples had been collected from field experiments and air-dried (< 40-degrees-C) before measuring soil-test P (bicarbonate-extractable P). The samples were from field plots that had been treated with different applications of fertilizer P (superphosphate, rock phosphate) one or more years previously. Soil-test P was measured on two different subsamples of the same sample: either A, in the year the sample was collected; or B, after the sample had been stored at fluctuating room temperatures either from 2 to 8 years (four field experiments) or 17 years (59 field experiments). The room temperature ranged from 10 to 30-degrees-C, and averaged 17-degrees-C. The aim was to test whether soil-test P was systematically and consistently different between subsamples A and B. Differences between A and B were mostly small, and there were no consistent or systematic differences. For the Colwell soil test, applied to a range of south-western Australian soils, possible decreases in soil-test P due to continued reaction with the soil could not be detected using bicarbonate-extractable soil P, and storage of air-dry samples at room temperature did not significantly affect soil-test P measured up to 17 years later.

Yet, the effects of altering temperature regimes on SOC mineralization remain poorly understood in forest plantations converted from natural forests. Forest conversion is extensive and could have major impact on SOC dynamics, so that this knowledge limits our ability of predicting the consequences of such land use change on carbon cycling. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a 360-day incubation experiment under constant and varying temperature regimes for soils of a natural forest and a Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation. Results showed that SOC mineralization was greater in the forest plantation soil than in the natural forest soil in both temperature treatments, possibly due to greater labile SOC in the forest plantation soil by 27-28%. The results suggested that replacing natural forests with forest plantations may increase CO2 emission via the mineralization of SOC. In the natural forest soil, SOC mineralization was greater in the varying temperature treatment relative to the constant temperature treatment but no difference was found in the forest plantation soil. Moreover, temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of SOC mineralization was greater in the natural forest soil than the Chinese fir soil for the 0-180 day of the incubation. The difference in the response to the two temperature treatments between the two forest soils which was accompanied by difference in soil microbial communities. It was likely that soil microbes of the closed-canopy natural forest were less adapted to temperature fluctuations than soil microbes of the forest plantation soil as the canopy was rarely closed.

Our sensors recorded high-frequency variation in pH (Hut Point and Cape Evans only), tide (Cape Evans and New Harbor), and water mass properties (temperature and salinity) during spring and early summer 2011. These collective observations showed that (1) pH differed spatially both in terms of mean pH (Cape Evans: 8.009 +/- 0.015; Hut Point: 8.020 +/- 0.007) and range of pH (Cape Evans: 0.090; Hut Point: 0.036), and (2) pH was not related to the mixing of two water masses, suggesting that the observed pH variation is likely not driven by this abiotic process. Given the large daily fluctuation in pH at Cape Evans, we developed a simple mechanistic model to explore the potential for biotic processes - in this case algal photosynthesis - to increase pH by fixing carbon from the water column. For this model, we incorporated published photosynthetic parameters for the three dominant algal functional groups found at Cape Evans (benthic fleshy red macroalgae, crustose coralline algae, and sea ice algal communities) to estimate oxygen produced/carbon fixed from the water column underneath fast sea ice and the resulting pH change. These results suggest that biotic processes may be a primary driver of pH variation observed under fast sea ice at Cape Evans and potentially at other shallow sites in McMurdo Sound.",,,,,"Matson, Paul/AAB-9767-2019","Matson, Paul/0000-0003-2105-7308; Martz, Todd/0000-0002-1996-7145",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,SEP 15,2014,9,9,,,,,,,e107239,10.1371/journal.pone.0107239,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107239,,,,,,,,25221950,,,,,WOS:000341774800055,View Full Record in Web of Science

The process of HONO formation remains unclear, and comparisons between field measurements and model results have highlighted the presence of unknown HONO sources. HONO production on plant surfaces was recently suggested to contribute to atmospheric HONO formation, but there is limited information on the quantification of HONO production and uptake by plants. To address this gap in the existing knowledge, the current study investigated HONO exchange on living Zea mays plants. Experiments were conducted in growth chambers under controlled experimental conditions (temperature, relative humidity, NO2 mixing ratio, light intensity, CO2 mixing ratio) at temperatures ranging between 283 and 299 K. To investigate the effect of drought on HONO plant-atmosphere exchanges, experiments were carried out on two sets of Zea mays plants exposed to two different water supply conditions during their growth: optimal watering (70% of the field capacity) and water stress (30% of the field capacity). Results indicated that the uptake of HONO by control Zea mays plants increased linearly with ambient temperature, and was correlated with CO2 assimilation for temperatures ranging from 283 to 299 K. At 299 K, HONO production on the leaves offset this uptake and Zea mays plants were a source of HONO, with a net production rate of 27 +/- 7 ppt h(-1). Deposition velocities were higher for HONO than CO2, suggesting a higher mesophyll resistance for CO2 than HONO. As water stress reduced the stomatal opening, it also decreased plant-atmosphere gas exchange. Thus, climate change, which may limit the availability of water, will have an impact on HONO exchange between plants and the atmosphere. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Uscana lariophaga Steffan parasitizes the eggs of the bruchids both in the field and in storage. As chemical control of bruchids in traditional granaries is not appropriate for poor farmers, enhancement of the efficacy of the parasitoid by environmental manipulation has been investigated. The effect of temperature on the capacity of U. lariophaga to parasitize eggs has been studied at eleven constant and three fluctuating temperatures within the range 10 to 45 degrees C. Longevity of the female wasp decreased with increasing temperature. The rate of development increased linearly at temperatures from 17.5 to 35 degrees C, but decreased from 35 to 40 degrees C. Mortality of the developing wasp remained below 20% from 20 to 37.5 degrees C, but outside this range, mortality reached 100% at 15 and at 42.5 degrees C. Most parasitization occurred at temperatures of 25 and 30 degrees C. Sex ratio (percentage females) increased with temperature in the high temperature range. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) for U. lariophaga was highest in the temperature range from 30 to 37.5 degrees C and was higher than that of C. maculatus at all temperatures. While the r(m) value of C. maculatus did not vary much at temperatures from 25 to 35 degrees C, the r(m) value of the wasp doubled. Relative humidity did not effect longevity, egg-laying capacity, mortality, development time and sex ratio of the wasps with C. maculatus as host. However, with B. atrolineatus as the host, development time and mortality increased at lower relative humidity levels.

We illustrate this by measuring the effect of behaviour in a cool temperate species of grasshopper (Phaulacridium vittatum) over a range of spatial and temporal scales in laboratory and natural field experiments. Microhabitat selection at the site scale was tested in free-ranging grasshoppers and related to changing thermal quality over a daily period. Artificial warming experiments were then used to measure the temperature at which common thermoregulatory behaviours are initiated and the subsequent reductions in body temperature. Behavioural means such as timing of activity, choice of substrates with optimum surface temperatures, shade seeking and postural adjustments (e.g. stilting, vertical orientation) were found to be highly effective at maintaining preferred body temperature. The maximum voluntarily tolerated temperature (MVT) was determined to be 44 degrees C +/- 0.4 degrees C, indicating the upper bounds of thermal flexibility in this species. Behavioural thermoregulation effectively enables small ectotherms to regulate exposure to changing environmental temperatures and utilize the spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments they occupy. Species such as the wingless grasshopper, although adapted to cool temperate conditions, are likely to be well equipped to respond successfully to coarse scale climate change.

After river restoration activities, fish abundance is expected to increase and also fluctuates naturally by season and with environmental conditions.

Automated data processing enabled continuous abundance estimates from fish tracks. A threefold increase in mean fish abundance was recorded after dam removal. A fourfold increase in median fish abundance occurred in the fall relative to spring and summer of the same year, regardless of dam presence. Interannual fish abundance in every season monitored increased at least twofold after dam removal. We related variability in fish abundance to tide, discharge, temperature, diurnal cycle, daylength, moon phase, and restoration activities (focusing on dam presence). Daylength corresponding to the fall and summer was the most important indicator for higher fish abundance. Fish abundance was generally greatest in the fall during outgoing tides at night, with lesser peaks occurring during the month of June at night. Before dam removal, fish abundance peaked when water temperature was less than 9.25 degrees C, at night, during outgoing tides. After dam removal, fish abundance peaked when daylength was less than 11.3 hr, at night, during outgoing tides, when water temperature was above 4.56 degrees C and no full moon was present. Peak fish abundance occurred during only 0.02-2.3% of the total time sampled. The threefold increase in fish abundance recorded after dam removal was observed despite yearly stocking efforts of adult alewife increasing 24% in postdam removal years.

Honey bees are a classic example and maintain their thoracic muscles at temperatures (T-th) tuned to the caloric benefits of floral resources. Using infrared thermography, we tested the hypothesis that forager motivation to recruit nestmates for a food source is positively correlated with T-th. We trained bees to a sucrose feeder located 5-100m from the nest. Recruiting foragers had a significantly higher average T-th (2.7 degrees C higher) when returning from 2.5mol l(-1) sucrose (65% w/w) than when returning from 1.0mol l(-1) sucrose (31% w/w). Foragers exhibited significantly larger thermal fluctuations the longer they spent inside the nest between foraging trips. The difference between maximum and minimum temperatures during a nest visit (T-range) increased with total duration of the nest visit (0.7 degrees C increase per additional min spent inside the nest). Bees that recruited nestmates (waggle or round danced) were significantly warmer, with a 1.4-1.5 times higher Delta T-th (difference between T-th and nest ambient air temperature) than bees who tremble danced or simply walked on the nest floor without recruiting between foraging bouts. However, recruiter T-th was not correlated with finer-scale measures of motivation: the number of waggle dance circuits or waggle dance return phase duration. These results support the hypothesis that forager T-th within the nest is correlated to broad-scale differences in foraging motivation.",,,,,"Nieh, James C/H-8705-2014","Nieh, James C/0000-0001-6237-0726",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,FEB,2011,214,3,,,,,469,475,,10.1242/jeb.049445,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.049445,,,,,,,,21228206,,,,,WOS:000286807900021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many ectotherms are capable of active thermoregulation, e.g. by selecting suitable microhabitats. However, this may be constrained by unavailability of favourable microhabitats or high energetic costs of theimoregulation. Thus, to achieve the optimal performance levels, adaptations to local thermal environments are of great importance. Due to the inability of leaving their aquatic habitat, larval anurans should especially benefit from local thermal adaptations. Rana temporaria is a widely distributed European anuran species, inhabiting a range of microhabitats, which makes it an excellent model to study the potential of local thermal adaptation. We raised R. temporaria tadpoles from Germany and Croatia under respective natural temperature fluctuations and three constant temperatures (15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees C), and tested dependency of their thermal preferences on the developmental stage and temperature regime, and the population origin. Tadpoles of both origins selected higher temperatures towards the end of the developmental period, and their thermal preferences were affected by the developmental temperature. However, regardless of the developmental stage or treatment, tadpoles from warmer Croatia selected higher temperatures than tadpoles from colder Germany. This demonstrates the tendency of adjusting the sensitivity of physiological processes to local thermal conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

As a result, the animals made shorter and more frequent movements in and out of the harvest areas while maintaining 9% higher body temperatures. This experimental design coupled with radiotelemetry and behavioral observation of a wild ectotherm population prior to and in response to anthropogenic habitat alteration is the first of its kind. Our results indicate that even in a relatively contiguous forested landscape with small-scale timber harvests, there are local effects on the thermal ecology of ectotherms. Ultimately, the results of this research can benefit the conservation and management of temperature-dependent species by informing effects of timber management across landscapes amid changing climates.",,,,,"Currylow, Andrea/J-5506-2014","Currylow, Andrea/0000-0003-1631-8964",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUL 6,2012,7,7,,,,,,,e40473,10.1371/journal.pone.0040473,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0040473,,,,,,,,22792344,,,,,WOS:000306461800093,View Full Record in Web of Science

B.; McQuillan, Peter; Hughes, Lesley",,,The effectiveness of common thermo-regulatory behaviours in a cool temperate grasshopper,JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Behavioural thermoregulation has the potential to alleviate the short-term impacts of climate change on some small ectotherms, without the need for changes to species distributions or genetic adaptation. We illustrate this by measuring the effect of behaviour in a cool temperate species of grasshopper (Phaulacridium vittatum) over a range of spatial and temporal scales in laboratory and natural field experiments. Microhabitat selection at the site scale was tested in free-ranging grasshoppers and related to changing thermal quality over a daily period. Artificial warming experiments were then used to measure the temperature at which common thermoregulatory behaviours are initiated and the subsequent reductions in body temperature. Behavioural means such as timing of activity, choice of substrates with optimum surface temperatures, shade seeking and postural adjustments (e.g. stilting, vertical orientation) were found to be highly effective at maintaining preferred body temperature. The maximum voluntarily tolerated temperature (MVT) was determined to be 44 degrees C +/- 0.4 degrees C, indicating the upper bounds of thermal flexibility in this species. Behavioural thermoregulation effectively enables small ectotherms to regulate exposure to changing environmental temperatures and utilize the spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments they occupy. Species such as the wingless grasshopper, although adapted to cool temperate conditions, are likely to be well equipped to respond successfully to coarse scale climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A mathematical model parametrized using fuzzy rule-based systems of the Takagi-Sugeno-Kant type (FTSK) for estimating the development time from egg to infecting larval stage L3 of the gastrointestinal parasite O. ostertagi is here proposed. The estimation of development time of O. ostertagi is essential for the generation of appropriate control mechanisms. since this provides information about the time when parasites are ready to migrate to pastures. For the purpose of reflecting the natural environmental conditions, the mean daily temperature is taken as the main and only regulator of the development time. Humidity conditions are considered to be sufficient for the normal development of the larvae. Hence the individual's daily growth is a function of its length and the mean temperature recorded on the previous day. It is expressed in terms of a difference equation with fuzzy parameters, which are defined using laboratory data. Model outputs are tested against results of field experiments. Simulation results are very satisfactory, yielding a mean estimation error (MEE) of 0.64 weeks, with variance 0.34, and a determination coefficient R(2) = 0.74. The model clearly exhibits an inverse relationship between development time and temperature both in controlled and in field conditions. It also exhibits a very sensitive response both to the order in which the temperature sequence occurs, - reproducing the differences observed between spring and autumn - and to the amplitude of the temperature range.

In the Symbiodiniaceae exists a high genetic diversity with broad physiological plasticity within and between species, resulting in large thermal tolerance. While these variations have been studied in individual taxa, comprehensive comparative experimental data on numerous species are still rare. In the present study, the photosynthetic performance and tolerance as function of light and temperature of nine Symbiodiniaceae genetic types of four different clades were determined. The data indicate significant differences in the response patterns. Almost all algal isolates exhibited low to moderate light requirements for photosynthesis without photoinhibition, and a photosynthetic efficiency between 20 and 80% in the temperature range 20-34 degrees C, indicating a broad thermal tolerance to temperature fluctuations in tropical regions.

Recent studies have documented disrupted synchrony in plant-herbivore and predator-prey interactions. However, studies investigating climate-related asynchrony in host-parasitoid interactions and exploring the relative responses of interacting hosts and parasitoids to climate change are lacking. This is an important gap in knowledge given the ubiquity of insect parasitoids and their importance in influencing the abundance and dynamics of their hosts. In the threatened marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) and its specialized parasitoid, Cotesia bignellii (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) phenological synchrony (and consequently population fluctuations) are thought to be weather-dependent. To assess the likely influence of climate and microenvironment change on synchrony between E. aurinia and C. bignellii, we experimentally manipulated the exposure of sensitive-stage host larvae and parasitoid pupae to temperature (ambient or elevated) and shading (shaded or unshaded) regimes. We also analysed a 20-year population dynamic dataset from the United Kingdom for E. aurinia to investigate whether population variations could be explained by interannual variations in the thermal and sunshine environment. Development times were affected significantly by the experimental temperature and shading treatments for E. aurinia but not for C. bignellii. However, the contrasting responses were insufficient to significantly affect host availability for parasitoids. In the field, thermal and sunshine conditions did not influence population fluctuations, and population variations across a large (UK-wide) scale were uncorrelated. Changes to the thermal and sunshine environment of the magnitude investigated in our experiment and within the range experienced by wild E. aurinia populations over the last 20-years thus seem unlikely to cause breakdown in host-parasitoid synchrony.

Within-individual plasticity (acclimation) counteracts potentially negative physiological effects resulting from environmental changes and thereby maintains fitness across a broad range of environments. The capacity for the acclimation of individuals may therefore determine the persistence of populations in variable environments. 2. We determined phylogenetic relationships by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of six populations of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) from coastal and mountain environments and compared their capacity for thermal acclimation to test the hypotheses that acclimation capacity is greater in more seasonal environments with less diurnal variability, that acclimation is genetically constrained and that demographic processes determine acclimation capacity. 3. We show that populations are divided into distinct genetic lineages and that populations within lineages have distinct genetic identities. There were significant differences in the capacity for acclimation between traits (swimming performance, citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase activities), between lineages and between populations within lineages. 4. We rejected the hypothesis that climatic conditions (coastal vs. mountain) determined the capacity for acclimation, but accepted the hypotheses that demographic processes and genetic constraint influenced thermal acclimation. 5. The importance of our data lies in proof of concept that there can be substantial variation in thermal plasticity between populations within species. Similar responses are likely to be found in other species that comprise structured populations. Many predictions of the impact of climate change on biodiversity assume a species-specific response to changing environments.

Defining experimentally supported functional relationships between molecular entities by mathematical terms enables the application of computational routines to simulate and analyse the underlying molecular system. In many fields of natural sciences and engineering, trigonometric functions are applied to describe oscillatory processes. As biochemical oscillations occur in many aspects of biochemistry and biophysics, Fourier analysis of metabolic functions promises to quantify, describe and analyse metabolism and its reaction towards environmental fluctuations. Here, Fourier polynomials were developed from experimental time-series data and combined with block diagram simulation of plant metabolism to study heat shock response of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation and carbohydrate metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Simulations predicted a stabilising effect of reduced sucrose biosynthesis capacity and increased capacity of starch biosynthesis on carbon assimilation under transient heat stress.

Sites in Kenya ranged between r(e_clim) = 2.1 at high altitude (Matanya) and 4.1 in western Kenya (Ahero). This means that 4.1 times the Swedish C input to soil is necessary to maintain Swedish soil carbon levels in Ahero, if soil type and management are equal. Diagrams showing daily r(e_clim) dynamics are presented for all sites, and differences in within-year dynamics are discussed. A model experiment indicated that a Swedish soil in balance with respect to soil carbon would lose 41% of its soil carbon during 30 y, if moved to Ahero, Kenya. If the soil was in balance in Ahero with respect to soil carbon, and then moved to Sweden, soil carbon mass would increase by 64% in 30 y. The validity of the methodology and results is discussed, and r(e_clim) is compared with other climate indices. A simple method to produce a rough estimate of r(e_clim) is suggested.",,,,,"Kätterer, Thomas/L-2107-2013","Kätterer, Thomas/0000-0002-1751-007X; Andren, Olof/0000-0002-9817-6308",,,,,,,,,,,,,0044-7447,1654-7209,,,,JUL,2007,36,5,,,,,379,386,,10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[379:SCADAI]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[379:SCADAI]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,17847802,,,,,WOS:000248512700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

(Verbenaceae), a widely-distributed ruderal, but considered as an originally mediterranean plant. In an initial experiment, samples of seeds buried in the field were exhumed at monthly intervals over a period of 38 months and tested for germination in light and darkness at 25/15 degreesC and 1515 degreesC. Seeds were strongly dormant when fresh and mature and came out of dormancy during winter. Seeds entered conditional dormancy in spring, while main dormancy relief occurred in winter. There was no seed mortality, and no germination occurred in the soil during burial. The results imply, that V officinalis germinates preferably in late spring and has the potential to accumulate a persistent seed bank. The effects of stratification temperature and duration on dormancy were investigated in a second experiment. Dry-stored seeds were stratified wet at a range of temperatures from 3-18 degreesC in darkness for periods of up to 28 weeks, and tested over a range of constant temperatures (3-25 degreesC) and at 1515 degreesC in light, and at 25 degreesC and 1515 degreesC in the dark. Seeds came out of primary dormancy when kept at temperatures between 3-12 degreesC, while higher temperatures were ineffective in breaking dormancy. There was no induction of secondary dormancy during the stratification period of 28 weeks. We conclude that a gradual increase of the ambient temperatures and/or an increase in amplitude size is required for dormancy induction. Weakly dormant seeds required either high constant mean (> 15 degreesC), or fluctuating temperatures for germination. Only a small fraction of the seeds acquired the ability to germinate in darkness with incremental stratification. There is no indication of germination and dormancy traits that can be interpreted as relict adaptations to mediterranean conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1439-1791,,,,,,2003,4,4,,,,,329,337,,10.1078/1439-1791-00164,http://dx.doi.org/10.1078/1439-1791-00164,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000184879400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Microbial respiration of litter with lower CN ratio (alder and willow) was significantly higher than respiration of feces, no significant difference was found for maple litter with higher CN ratio. This was supported by field litter bag experiments where alder and willow litter decomposed faster than feces but the opposite was true for maple litter. Litter respiration was significantly affected by temperature but feces respiration was not. Fluctuating temperature caused either lower or equal respiration as compared to mean constant temperature. The content of phenolics was significantly higher in intact litter in comparison with decomposed litter and feces, either fresh or decomposed.

Here we describe modifications and performance tests of a commercial HTC analyzer MQ Scientific, model MQ-1001), many of which are applicable to other HTC instruments. Design improvements include a new combustion column, auto-sampler needle assembly, and a smaller sparger/water trap that automatically maintains constant water level and pH. Techniques for monitoring and compensating for carrier gas flow rate fluctuations, as well as electronic improvements to the auto-sampler advance control and the high-pressure injection gas pulse, are also described. A new model LICOR 7000, nondispersive IR (NDIR) detector is. shown to provide a 50-fold increase in sensitivity over the previous LICOR 6252 model. The total blank for the modified instrument is initially similar to 27 ng C and declines during use to similar to 9 ng C as the combustion column ages. For an instrument with a well-conditioned combustion column, approximately. half of this background is resolvable into a reagent component coming largely from the deionized, UV irradiated (DUV) water used to rinse the sample onto the combustion column the other half is intrinsic to the instrument and appears associated with the quartz bead packing. Injection of varying volumes of DUV water with and without an added constant C background, indicates that our DUV water contains between 2 and 9-1tM DOC, depending on the variable performance of the water purifier. Similar experiments indicate that the intrinsic instrument blank is variable over time and depends complexly on both the wait time between individual water injections and the overall time that the combustion column has been conditioned. The modified instrument fitted with the new LICOR 7000 detector measures 46.1 +/- 1.3. muM DOC in Sargasso Sea water reference material (44-45 muM) against a total instrument blank equivalent to about a fourth-of this value.

Light quality is the main abiotic factor influencing germination of small seeds; however, studies often do not discriminate its effect from that of light irradiance. This study compared specific requirements for seed germination of ten small-seeded species, with restricted occurrence in only one of three contrasting microhabitats: forest understorey, edge of clearings and open areas. Laboratory experiments were carried out to test temperature regime (constant or fluctuating), light quality (R:FR) and light irradiance (PAR), which reproduce high and low conditions commonly found in the microhabitats. Seed germination of all species occurred between 20 and 30 degrees C, only seeds of open area species were able to germinate at 35 degrees C and no species required alternating temperatures to germinate. Irrespective of species and microhabitat, a decrease in the R:FR reduced the germination percentage; however, there were differences in the capacity to germinate at low R:FR. The values of R:FR50% were higher for open area and edge species (0.441-0.345) than for understorey species (0.181-0.109), with few exceptions. For all species and most of the tests, germination was not influenced by PAR. Light quality is the most important light signal for germination of small seeds; irradiance has little effect. Our results suggest two distinct patterns of germination for small-seeded species: open area and edge species are light-demanding and require high R:FR to germinate, while understorey species are shade-tolerant and germinate at low R:FR. These differences are responsible for distinct microhabitat occurrence and help to explain the coexistence of species in tropical forests.",,,,,"carvalho, amanda/GWR-1678-2022; ANDRADE, ANTONIO CARLOS SILVA DE/A-8629-2010","ANDRADE, ANTONIO CARLOS SILVA DE/0000-0003-2271-8569; Guimaraes de Andrade, Leticia/0000-0002-2368-1676",,,,,,,,,,,,,1435-8603,1438-8677,,,,NOV,2021,23,6,,,,,981,991,,10.1111/plb.13328,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/plb.13328,,SEP 2021,,,,,,34532932,,,,,WOS:000696391700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, we addressed the role of food and temperature in explaining occasional mass mortalities. A Dynamic Energy Budget Model (DEBM) was used for simulations at the individual level. We calibrated the DEBM successfully using experimental data on growth in length and mass of C.fluminea under four combinations of temperature and food. The calibrated DEBM was used to simulate the annual growth in length and mass and the reproductive success under different environmental scenarios. In general, an increase in temperature and food concentration resulted in larger and heavier clams and a higher per capita rate of reproduction. However, phytoplankton densities in rivers often fluctuate strongly and densities are high only briefly. Under such conditions, our simulations suggest that the temporal interactions of temperature and food concentration are particularly important and can decisively influence annual growth. With regard to occasional mass mortalities, it has been hypothesised that increased temperature might induce an unmet metabolic demand and hence starvation. To test this, we simulated the conditions observed in the Rhine in 2003, when there was a severe heat wave and a mass mortality. For this purpose, we used the calibrated DEBM and, in addition, integrated it into a Physiologically Structured Population Model (PSPM) to account for processes at the population level. Based on these simulations, it seems unlikely that starvation was the main cause of the mass mortality, although not all mechanisms affecting the energy budget are fully understood. However, a prolonged negative energy budget during heat waves can increase the vulnerability of clams to direct effects of high temperatures or additional stressors and might thus be regarded as an important factor indirectly increasing mortality rates.",,,,,,"Petter, Gunnar/0000-0002-3691-5267",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,APR,2014,59,4,,,,,832,846,,10.1111/fwb.12307,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12307,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000332220100015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, inference of the selective forces suffers the challenge that many environmental factors covary. With well-controlled environmental conditions, experimental evolution provides a powerful approach to complement the analysis of natural populations. On the other hand, it is apparent that laboratory conditions differ in many ways from natural environments, which raises the question as to what extent selection responses in experimental evolution studies can inform us about adaptation processes in the wild. In this study, we compared the expression profiles of replicatedDrosophila melanogasterpopulations which have been exposed to two distinct temperature regimes (18/28 and 10/20 degrees C) in the laboratory for more than 80 generations. Using gene-wise differential expression analysis and co-expression network analysis, we identified 541 genes and three coregulated gene modules that evolved in the same direction in both temperature regimes, and most of these changes probably reflect an adaptation to the space constraint or diurnal temperature fluctuation that is common in both selection regimes. In total, 203 genes and seven modules evolved temperature-specific expression changes. Remarkably, we detected a significant overlap of these temperature-adaptive genes/modules from experimental evolution with temperature-adaptive genes inferred from naturalDrosophilapopulations covering two different temperature clines.

The analysed factors were soil moisture, temperature, and the content of light-fraction (density less than or equal to 2 Mg/m(3)) organic carbon (LC) contained in the soil. The error associated with the estimate of in situ N mineralisation was analysed using undisturbed samples in laboratory incubations. The coefficient of variation of in situ N mineralisation ranged from 58 to 234%. Nitrogen and LC mineralisation in the field showed a similar temporal pattern. The major factor affecting this pattern was soil temperature, soil moisture being near the optimum level throughout the experiment. The rate of N mineralisation during an incubation period was correlated with the content of LC at the beginning of the period; this factor explained 40-50% of the variation in N mineralisation. At a low rate of N mineralisation, a large proportion of the spatial variability was attributed to the error of estimation. From the relationship between N mineralisation and LC content, we estimated the rate constant k which could be expressed as a function of soil temperature. Within the observed temperature range (daily mean average 11-17 degrees C), the Q(10) (temperature coefficient) of in situ N mineralisation was 1.5. Negative values of N mineralisation were associated with the lower LC content of each period, indicating the presence of an immobilisation process, or that a proportion of LC was not involved in N mineralisation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-9573,,,,,,1996,34,5,,,,,755,767,,10.1071/SR9960755,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR9960755,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VF03700012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Low winter temperatures produced a massive die-off of the C. fluminea population. The mortality of the clams was size class and depth dependent. At the mean low water level (MLL), all clams died because of lying dry. However, at MLL -1 m and at MLL -3 m, mortality was a consequence of water temperatures around 2 degrees C for nearly 3 months.

Numerous important environmental parameters can fluctuate dramatically, notably dissolved oxygen, turbidity and temperature. The roles of dissolved oxygen and turbidity on predator-prey interactions have been discussed in detail elsewhere within this issue and will be considered only briefly here. Here, we will focus primarily on the role of temperature and its potential impact upon predator-prey interactions. Two key properties are of particular note. For temperate aquatic ecosystems, all piscine and invertebrate piscivores and their prey are ectothermic. They will therefore be subject to energetic demands that are significantly affected by environmental temperature. Furthermore, the physical properties of water, particularly its high thermal conductivity, mean that thermal microenvironments will not exist so that fine-scale habitat movements will not be an option for dealing with changing water temperature in lentic environments. Unfortunately, there has been little experimental analysis of the role of temperature on such predator-prey interactions, so we will instead focus on theoretical work, indicating that potential implications associated with thermal change are unlikely to be straightforward and may present a greater threat to predators than to their prey. Specifically, we demonstrate that changes in the thermal environment can result in a net benefit to cold-adapted species through the mechanism of predator-prey interactions.",,,,,"Hedges, Kevin/A-6378-2014","Hedges, Kevin/0000-0002-2219-2360; Abrahams, Mark/0000-0002-9969-2988",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8436,1471-2970,,,,NOV 29,2007,362,1487,,,,,2095,2104,,10.1098/rstb.2007.2102,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2007.2102,,,,,,,,17472922,,,,,WOS:000250224500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

As impinging jet ventilation (IJV) has a potential for reducing high energy consumption compared to the use of mixing ventilation (MV), a series of experiments were conducted to investigate the temperature distribution and energy consumption of IJV used in a space with cold air invading intermittently and compared with those in a MV system. The results indicate that the door opening frequency only affects the amplitude of temperature fluctuation with time for a fixed door opening duration. The floor-to-ceiling temperature difference in the IJV is always less than 60% of that in the MV for different durations of door opening, proving that the former consumes less heating energy. Moreover, the increase of the inertia to buoyancy ratio on the supply air can improve the thermal environment and reduce energy consumption for both IJV and MV, with this improvement better in IJV than in MV, meaning that IJV is more energy efficient than MV when used for heating space with cold air invasion.

J,"Sestan, L",,,,"Sestan, Ljiljana",,,SIMULATION MODEL OF THE EFFECT OF AIR TEMPERATURE ON THE LEAVES PHENOPHASES OF THE PUBESCENT OAK ON THE ISLAND OF PAG,SUMARSKI LIST,,,,,,,,,,,,"The impact of climate change has been observed in case of occurrence and duration of seasons which in deciduous forest manifest through changing of the leaves. Monitoring changes in the development of leaves was carried out through phenological observations, where specific change corresponds to a particular phenophase. In researching this issue, despite numerous studies, phenophases have not been studied as a system, but individually and then compared (e.g. Ahas et al., 2002; Menzel, 2000). Most previous studies of this issue were related to classical statistical methods, such as descriptive statistics, linear regression, correlation, multiple regression (e.g. Ahas et al., 2002; Chemielewski and Rotzer, 2001; Menzel, 2000). The most commonly used method, the method of linear regression, assumes a linear relationship between phenomena. However, as relations between elements of complex natural system are not always linear, the application of the linear regression method is not sufficient for the development of a model of the entire process, without losing specific components and including the environmental influence (Sestan 2010). Therefore, in this study, to model and study the effect of air temperature on the system of phenophases, the system-dynamic principle was applied. The research of the impact of the most important climatic factor - air temperature, on the phenophases, was conducted on experimental plot in the pubescent oak forest (Quercus pubescens) on the island of Pag (Adriatic Sea). Systematic phenological observations were carried out there during period 1993-2005. Six phenophases marked as F0, F1...F5, were distinguished: 1. Dormant vegetation, all the leaves have fallen (F0), 2. Leaves begin to develop (F1), 3. Leaves are fully developed (F2), 4. Leaves begin to change colour (F3), 5. Leaves have completely changed colour (F4), 6. The leaves begin to fall (F5). The relevant indicators of the dynamics of phenophases were obtained by collecting and organizing data through phenological observations: average time of appearance in the annual cycle, the average duration of the annual cycle and the frequency of certain phenophases (table 1). Based on systematic observations of phenological data, the frequency of crossing between phenophases was determined as the neighbouring phenophases state differences (table 2). Data on the dynamics of air temperature were obtained from the State Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. The process of determining the characteristic distribution was carried out for the weekly mean air temperature for all phenophases when they are present, or when the state of phenophase is greater than 0 (table 5). Gathered and processed data have allowed the building of the simulation model of the system of phenophases. Simulation model was based on system-dynamic approach (figure 1). In order to determine whether the model represents the real system satisfactorily, the process of model validation was carried out (table 6 and table 7). The research of the influence of air temperature on leaf phenophases was conducted with the developed model, through different scenarios from 1 to 6. The results of the simulated scenarios (table 8, 9 and 10) confirmed the crucial influence of temperature on the leaves phenophases. The results of these studies have shown that on average, phenophases F1, F4 and F0, are the most sensitive on the fluctuations in air temperature, but above all F1 as first that reacts to change. However, they also showed that all phenophases are not equally responsive to temperature changes. It is interesting that phenophases F3 and F5 showed the least sensitivity to temperature changes, in terms of average time of occurrence. Such result of the simulation experiments indicates that those phenophases are significantly influenced by other factors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0373-1332,1846-9140,,,,,2012,136,5-6,,,,,253,261,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000306774800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the absence of monitoring tools that are effective during midseason when the adults of this generation emerge, a temperature-based emergence model would be useful as an alternative decision aid. In this study, we determined rates of larval development (from oviposition to peak emergence of larvae) and pupal development (from larval emergence to peak emergence of adults) for two populations of C. nenuphar in constant temperatures ranging from approximate to11-37degreesC, developed linear regression models to describe the relationships between developmental rate and temperature for both stages, and estimated degree-day requirements for completing development from these models. The lower threshold temperature was 11.1 and 8.7degreesC for larval and pupal development, respectively. The thermal time requirement from oviposition to peak emergence of larvae was 215.5 DD, and peak emergence of adults occurred 442.4 DD later. For model validation, rearing experiments were carried out with both populations in fluctuating temperatures in the greenhouse and outdoors. Observed degree-day requirements were not significantly different from model-predicted values for larval emergence in the greenhouse and for adult emergence in the greenhouse and outdoors. For larval emergence outdoors, the model overestimated time to peak emergence by approximate to35 DD (2-3 calendar d), most likely because these trials were carried out during relatively cool conditions in which overestimation by a linear model would not be unexpected. Aspects related to further validation of the model and its use in orchard conditions are discussed.",,,,,,"Scherm, Harald/0000-0002-3196-3163",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,APR,2004,33,2,,,,,174,181,,10.1603/0046-225X-33.2.174,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-33.2.174,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000220856500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

This parasite is prevalent in some bird species in Northern Europe, however the records obtained are only from adult long-distance migrant birds after their return from the wintering grounds. A recent experimental study showed that this parasite completes sporogonic development in the local European vector Culex pipiens at a controlled mean temperature of 19 & DEG;C. Thereby, temperature limits for the transmission of this parasite in Northern Europe remain unknown. In this study, we took a step further and tested the impact of different temperature conditions, including some extreme fluctuations between 23 & DEG;C down to 7 & DEG;C, on the sporogonic development of P. relictum (pGRW4) in the vector Culex pipiens form molestus. Mosquitoes were exposed to infection and kept under different air-temperature conditions: (i) constant warm temperature, (ii) natural outdoor temperatures and (iii) temporary exposure to low temperatures. Plasmodium relictum (pGRW4) completed sporogony in mosquitoes of all experimental groups, however different patterns of the sporogonic development depending on temperature conditions were observed. Based on these results, we conclude that the cool air temperature of Northern Europe in summer is not a limiting factor in successful development of the parasite. However, delayed sporogony caused by low summer temperatures may have a detrimental impact on the active transmission of this parasite in Northern Europe.",,,,,"Palinauskas, Vaidas/J-1576-2016; Platonova, Elena/R-6750-2017","Palinauskas, Vaidas/0000-0002-4714-0305; Platonova, Elena/0000-0002-9425-8998",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-2607,,,,NOV,2021,9,11,,,,,,,2240,10.3390/microorganisms9112240,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9112240,,,,,,,,34835365,,,,,WOS:000724246900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Expts 2-4, seeds dry stored at 4 degrees C and stratified at 5 and 15 degrees C were tested at constant temperatures, as well as fluctuating temperatures with constant and increasing amplitudes. Results suggest that the rate of dormancy release increased with increasing temperatures ranging from 4.5 to 18.6 degrees C. However, prolonged strati. cation at higher temperatures caused subsequent induction of dormancy. When tested at constant temperatures, stratified seeds germinated between 18 and 34 degrees C, with the optimum between 26 and 30 degrees C, while dry-stored seeds showed no germination. Fluctuating temperatures, with amplitudes ranging from 5 to 15 degrees C, promoted germination of seeds from all treatments.

The international recognized falling number test can be used to measure that damage. Trying to understand the complex interactions that cause a reduction in wheat quality, equating to low falling number levels, is challenging. An alternative research approach to replicated experiments was to use a multiseason dataset of load-by-load delivery information to investigate whether correlations between falling number levels and 40 climate measurements could be identified. Findings This study used over 250,000 falling number data points from individual truckloads tested during seven harvests in Western Australia. The analyses identified relative humidity measured at the maximum temperature and daily temperature range as having consistent correlations with falling number levels over multiple seasons. Other climate measurements were also observed to have significant correlations with falling number, but these were less consistent within and between seasons. Conclusions The linkage of humidity and temperature range levels in the period before harvest commences to the occurrence of low falling number levels helps to further understand the complex interactions that change starch quality.

The average minimum and maximum room temperatures were 26.0 +/- 1.9 and 36.0 +/- 1.8 degrees C, respectively, with relative humidity ranging from 42.3 +/- 1.8% to 55.1 +/- 2.1%. Each dietary treatment was fed to four cages (six birds/cage) from 32 to 42 wk of age. Egg production, egg weight and feed intake were recorded daily. Egg quality traits were recorded every 5 wk. Leukocyte subset counts and blood lipid profile were evaluated at the end of experiment. The results showed that inclusion of 150 g/kg RB negatively influenced (P< 0.05) egg production (EP), feed conversion ratio (FCR), shell weight and shell thickness. Significant reductions (P<0.05) in the blood triglyceride and total cholesterol were observed with increasing dietary inclusion levels of RB. Although, dietary NPP levels did not influence any of the performance traits, the low-NPP diets caused a decrease (P< 0.05) in shell weight and shell thickness when compared with normal-NPP diets. The H/L ratio, as a stress indicator, was also increased (P< 0.05) by low-NPP diets. These adverse effects were partially overcome by the addition of microbial phytase (PHY). Supplemental PHY improved (P< 0.05) EP, FCR and unmarketable eggs but the magnitude of the responses was greater in low-NPP and high-RB treatments, resulting in significant RB x NPP x PHY interactions. Egg mass, shell weight and shell thickness were also improved (P< 0.05) by PHY addition but the response was greater at the highest concentration of RB, resulting in a significant RB x PHY interaction. Responses were also greater (P< 0.05) in low-NPP diets as indicated by significant NPP x PHY interaction. It can be concluded that the positive effects of PHY supplementation were clearly evident for laying hens reared under the high ambient temperatures pertaining to this study. At high concentration of phytate (high-RB diet) and/or low level of NPP (2.5 g/kg), response to supplemental PHY appears to be increase in terms of performance and egg quality in heat-stressed laying hens.

Creating a stable environment by providing a nearly constant temperature and relative humidity at correct levels decreases the risk of object degradation. Maintaining this steady indoor environment, however, increases energy consumption and risks to the historic building. Museum display cases offer a solution to the mitigation of risks to which valuable objects may be subjected by providing an extra layer of protection to indoor climate fluctuations. The Anne Frank House is a historic house museum located in Amsterdam. The museum has undergone several renovations in the last years to deal with an increase in the number of visitors to over 1.2 million a year. The original diaries and other documents of Anne Frank are permanently on display in the Anne Frank House. With the recent refurbishment the possibility arose to design a new state-of-the-art display case. This study presents the results of the experimental research related to the design, performed in-situ. The temperature and relative humidity in the new exhibition space and inside the new display cases were monitored to gain insight into the hygrothermal behavior of these controlled environments. A complementary numerical study was performed to investigate effects of dynamic climate control of the exhibition gallery and climate conditions in the display case under various circumstances. Four main conclusions are presented in this paper. The investigated display case design is able to provide a stable relative humidity environment by means of silica gel, while using an active box-in-box climate control system to create stable temperature conditions. The inner case temperature depends on the temperature supplied by the display case air handling unit. Protocols must be in place in case of malfunction or failure of the climate control system of the display case. The air handling unit of the case needs to be shut off to create a passive environment for the objects on display until necessary actions are taken. Exhibition gallery set points can be less stringent when susceptible museum objects are on display in the display case. The environments are separated and provide an opportunity for energy saving set point strategies. The last conclusion drawn is that the numerical study provides valuable insight into imposing dynamic control of set points for temperature and relative humidity in the exhibition gallery and the effect on the display case environment.",,,,,,"Kompatscher, Karin/0000-0003-4982-7933",,,,,,,,,,,,,0039-3630,2047-0584,,,,JUL 3,2020,65,5,,,,,262,284,,10.1080/00393630.2019.1703401,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00393630.2019.1703401,,DEC 2019,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000503525100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some wild individuals were in diapause in mid-August, and all males and females were in diapause by late August and early September respectively. 4. Individuals reared under decreasing day lengths and fluctuating temperatures were more likely to be in diapause than were individuals reared under long or short day lengths or constant temperatures. 5. Individuals fed potted old Asclepias curassavica plants were more likely to be in diapause than were those fed potted young host plants; when cuttings of Asclepias syriaca plants from the field or greenhouse pots were used, there was no effect of host plant age. 6. Extremely high temperatures increased the number of day-degrees required for development from egg to adult, while decreasing day lengths and older host plants tended to decrease the number of day-degrees required for development. 7. There appears to be a continuum of reproductive development in monarchs, with gradual declines in mean ejaculatory duct mass and oocyte production during the late summer. 8. None of the experimental treatments led to 100% diapause, and diapause was more likely to occur in monarchs subjected to more than one diapause-inducing cue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,,,,,DEC,2002,27,6,,,,,674,685,,10.1046/j.1365-2311.2002.00454.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2311.2002.00454.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000179239300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our experiment spanned a 6-month period (July-December 1996), during which artificially created changes in temperature (1.4degreesC) and moisture content of the soil (2.3%) were superimposed on seasonal variations of these variables. Functional diversity of soil bacteria was assessed using Biolog GN-plates. Bacterial diversity, richness and evenness as well as the mean oxidation of almost all Biolog substrate groups, were affected significantly by the seasonal fluctuations of soil temperature and moisture, and declined linearly from July to December. The substrates responsible for the differences in monthly soil samples were mainly carbohydrates and carboxylic acids. The small-scale experimental changes in temperature and moisture affected oxidation of only four out of the eight substrate groups. The effect of seasonality was also obvious on the diversity, evenness, richness and total density of soil bacterivorous nematodes, which exhibited higher values during the period September-October. The effect of experimental temperature and moisture modifications varied between the different nematode taxa. Acrobeles, Chiloplacus and Cephalobus responded significantly to small-scale temperature changes, while the responses of the other taxa, if any, were more complicated, depending on the interactive effect of both soil temperature and moisture. In any case, the experimental modifications of moisture alone did not induce significant changes in the structure of the nematode community. After comparing the community parameters of bacteria and bacterivorous nematodes, we conclude that there was no synchronised response between nematodes and their food resources.

To understand how such responses differ in recently isolated populations (<11,000 years), we studied four Baltic populations of the nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius L.) from coastal locations (seasonal temperature range, 0-29 degrees C) and from colder, more thermally stable spring-fed ponds (1-19 degrees C). Salinity and predation pressure also differed between these locations. We acclimatized wild-caught fish to 6, 11, and 19 degrees C in common garden conditions for 4-6 months and determined their aerobic scope and hepatosomatic index (HSI). The freshwater fish from the colder (2-14 degrees C), predator-free pond population exhibited complete temperature compensation for their aerobic scope, whereas the coastal populations underwent metabolic rate reduction during the cold treatment. Coastal populations had higher HSI than the colder pond population at all temperatures, with cold acclimation accentuating this effect. The metabolic rates and HSI for freshwater fish from the pond with higher predation pressure were more similar to those of the coastal ones. Our results suggest that ontogenic effects and/or genetic differentiation are responsible for differential energy storage and metabolic responses between these populations. This work demonstrates the metabolic versatility of the nine-spined stickleback and the pertinence of an energetic framework to better understand potential local adaptations. It also demonstrates that instead of using a single acclimation temperature thermal reaction norms should be compared when studying individuals originating from different thermal environments in a common garden setting.

The Acropora coral-eating flatworm (AEFW), Prosthiostomum acroporae (Platyhelminthes: Polycladida: Prosthiostomidae) feeds on wild and cultivated Acropora species and its inadvertent introduction into reef tanks can lead to the rapid death of coral colonies. To guide the treatment of infested corals we investigated the flatworm's life cycle parameters at a range of temperatures that represent those found in reef tanks, coral aquaculture facilities and seasonal fluctuations in the wild. We utilized P. acroporae from a long-term in vivo culture on Acropora species to examine the effects of temperature (3 degrees C increments from 21 to 30 degrees C) on flatworm embryonation period, hatching success, hatchling longevity, and time to sexual maturity. Our findings show that warmer seawater shortened generation times; at 27 degrees C it took, on average, 11 days for eggs to hatch, and 35 days for flatworms to reach sexual maturity, giving a minimum generation time of 38 days, whereas at 24 degrees C the generation time was 64 days. Warmer seawater (24-30 degrees C) also increased egg hatching success compared to cooler conditions (21 degrees C). These results indicate that warmer temperatures lead to higher population densities of P. acroporae. Temperature significantly increased the growth rate of P. acroporae, with individuals reaching a larger size at sexual maturity in warmer temperatures, but it did not influence hatchling longevity. Hatchlings, which can swim as well as crawl, can survive between 0.25 and 9 days in the absence of Acropora, and could therefore disperse between coral colonies and inter-connected aquaria. We used our data to predict embryonation duration and time to sexual maturity at 21-30 degrees C, and discuss how to optimize current treatments to disrupt the flatworm's life cycle in captivity.",,,,,,"Barton, Jonathan/0000-0002-7860-0335; Hutson, Kate/0000-0003-2408-3990; Humphrey, Craig/0000-0002-1303-036X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,SEP 4,2019,6,,,,,,,,524,10.3389/fmars.2019.00524,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00524,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000483814000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the effects of nutrient loading and climatic warming on CHABs are well-known, little is known regarding how these environmental drivers alter the structural and functional potential of the microbial assemblages associated with blooms that, in turn, may impact cyanobacterial growth. Here, we used next-generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal rRNA genes to characterize the dynamics of the bacterial assemblages within Microcystis colonies in two temperate North American lakes: Lake Erie and Lake Agawam (NY, United States) and quantified their responses to experimentally increased levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and temperature. Across experiments, Microcystis populations were consistently and significantly promoted by N and, to a lesser extent, elevated temperature (p < 0.05). In contrast, bacterial assemblages within Microcystis colonies were more resilient to environmental perturbations, with the relative abundance of 7-16% of amplicon sequence variants changing and several individual taxa displaying significant (p < 0.05) increases and decreases in relative abundance, primarily in response to elevated temperature and to a lesser extent, N. In contrast to individual taxa, community diversity was not significantly altered by individual treatments during experiments but rather was inversely correlated with the intensity of Microcystis blooms (p < 0.001). While predicted metabolic function was even less impacted by environmental drivers than microbial diversity, the predicted abundance of nitrogenase (nifH), alkaline phosphatase (phoX), and urease (ure) genes significantly increased in response to N but decreased in response to increased temperature (p < 0.05). Collectively, the resilience of microbial community structure and function within colonies suggests they may support the ability of Microcystis to persist through short-term fluctuations in environmental conditions by supplying essential nutrients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-302X,,,,FEB 10,2022,12,,,,,,,,781500,10.3389/fmicb.2021.781500,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.781500,,,,,,,,35222297,,,,,WOS:000760831000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results supported theoretical predictions on the costs of thermoregulation - environments that were fluctuating led to decreased accuracy of thermoregulation (increased deviations in body temperatures from preferred temperatures) and reduced thermoregulatory effort (effectiveness). Moreover, environments with a mean temperature farther from the preferred temperature also led to greater deviations in body temperature, although this had no significant effect on effectiveness of thermoregulation.

Air-sea fluxes, in the presence of a shallow mixed layer, efficiently effect intraseasonal SST fluctuations. Warming during intraseasonal events is smaller (<1 degrees C) for June - July period and larger (1.5 degrees to 2 degrees C) during September, the latter due to a thinner mixed layer. To examine the effect of salinity on ISV, the model was run by artificially increasing the salinity (NORR run) and by decreasing it (MAHA10 run). In NORR, both rainfall and river discharge were switched off and in MAHA10 the discharge by river Mahanadi was increased tenfold. The spatial pattern of ISV as well as its periodicity was similar in QR, NORR and MAHA10. The ISV was stronger in NORR and weaker in MAHA10, compared to QR. In NORR, both intraseasonal warming and cooling were higher than in QR, the former due to reduced air-sea heat loss as the mean SST was lower, and the latter due to enhanced subsurface processes resulting from weaker stratification. In MAHA10, both warming and cooling were lower than in QR, the former due to higher air-sea heat loss owing to higher mean SST, and the latter due to weak subsurface processes resulting from stronger stratification.

Remote sensed SST imagery has proven to be an effective technique in oceanic eddy detection, because of its high temporal and spatial resolution. Various techniques have been used to identify eddies from SST images. However, mainly owing to the strong morphological variation of oceanic eddies, there is arguably no uniquely correct eddy detection method. A scheme of algorithm based on quasi-contour tracing and clustering of eddy detection from SST dataset is presented. The method does not impose fixed restrictions or limitations during the course of suspected eddy detection, and any eddy-like structures can be detected as suspected eddies. Then, true eddies can be identified based on the combination of intensity and spatial/temporal scale criteria. This approach has been applied to detect eddies in the East China Sea by using Operational SST & Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) dataset. Experiments proved that oceanic eddies ranging in diameter from tens to hundreds of kilometers can be detected. Through investigation of the 2007-2011 OSTIA daily SST dataset from the Kuroshio region in the East China Sea, we found that the most active regions for oceanic eddies are those along the Kuroshio path, northeast of Taiwan Island, the Yangtze Estuary and the Ryukyu Islands.

This paper systematically evaluates the merits of the passive building thermal capacitance to minimize energy cost using optimal control. The evaluation is conducted by means of a sensitivity analysis utilizing a dynamic building energy simulation program coupled to a popular technical computing environment. The optimal controller predicts the required extent of precooling (zone temperature setpoint depression) depending on utility rate structure, occupancy and on-peak period duration and onset, internal gains, building mass, occupancy period temperature setpoint range, and weather as characterized by diurnal temperature and relative humidity swings. In addition to quantifying the building response, energy consumption, and utility cost, this paper extracts the dominant features of the optimal precooling strategies for each of the investigated cases so that guidelines for near-optimal building thermal mass savings can be developed in the future.

We characterized a dynamic range boundary between two estuarine sea slugs, Alderia modesta (distributed across the North Pacific and North Atlantic) and Alderia willowi, known from southern and central California. The species overlap from Bodega Bay to San Francisco Bay, where populations are dominated by A. modesta after winter rains but by A. willowi after peak summer temperatures. Laboratory assays confirmed superior tolerance to low salinity for the northern species, A. modesta: encapsulated embryos developed at 8 ppt, larvae survived at 4-6 ppt, and adults survived repeated exposure to 2 ppt, salinities that reduced development or survival for the same stages of A. willowi. Adults did not appreciably differ in their high-temperature threshold, however. Each species showed increased tolerance to either temperature or salinity stress at its range margin, indicating plasticity or local adaptation, but at the cost of reduced tolerance to the other stressor. At its northern limit, A. willowi became more tolerant of low salinity during the winter rainy season, but also less heat tolerant. Conversely, A. modesta became more heat resistant from spring to summer at its southern limit, but less tolerant of low salinity. Trade-offs in stress tolerance may generally constrain adaptation and limit biotic response to a rapidly changing environment, as well as differentiating species niches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3185,1939-8697,,,,AUG 1,2021,241,1,,,,,105,122,,10.1086/715845,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/715845,,AUG 2021,,,,,,34436970,,,,,WOS:000683902800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, increases in water-column nitrate led to periodic increases in tissue ammonium and amino acids, as well as decreases in non-reducing sugars. Toward the end of the experiment, increases in soluble carbohydrates for plants grown under higher temperatures may have been associated with an extension of the growing season.

However, while the relationships between aerial environment and cumulative crop yields are reasonably well understood, and a number of crop models have been developed, accurate predictions of the weekly patterns of crop yield are hard to achieve. A number of experiments have been conducted at HRI to investigate how light integral, temperature, and fruit load affect the pattern of yield so as to identify why yields fluctuate. The cyclical pattern of yield was largely caused by variation in the number of fruits picked per week rather than variation in the mean fruit size, which suggests that assimilate availability was not the primary cause. The variability in the number of fruits picked per week (even when all trusses had five fruits) indicates that the time from flowering to fruit maturation must have changed. A slight hastening of fruit maturation time tended to be associated with high yields, while low yields were often recorded when there was a delay in fruit maturation time. The changes in fruit development time were a result of fruits becoming more sensitive to temperature as they approached maturity. Therefore, a flush of ripe fruits followed a period of elevated temperature. However, rapid fruit ripening decreased the number of fruits nearing maturity on the plant, which resulted in depressed yield in subsequent weeks. This paper reports on progress in quantifying these relationships and in developing a model that can be used by growers, combined with better weather forecasting systems, for prediction of crop yields. Such a system should also provide information on how the aerial environment can be manipulated to modify the pattern of yield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,90-6605-846-3,,,,2002,,593,,,,,19,23,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.593.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.593.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000181547800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we focused on a natural piscine model, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and asked how seasonal immune allocation is driven by physical variables (time, light, and heat). Using functionally-relevant gene expression metrics as a reporter of seasonal immune allocation, we synchronously sampled fish monthly from the wild (two habitats), and from semi-natural outdoors mesocosms (stocked from one of the wild habitats). This was repeated across two annual cycles, with continuous within-habitat monitoring of environmental temperature and implementing a manipulation of temperature in the mesocosms. We also conducted a long-term laboratory experiment, subjecting acclimated wild fish to natural and accelerated (x2) photoperiodic change at 7 and 15 degrees C. The laboratory experiment demonstrated that immune allocation was independent of photoperiod and only a very modest effect, at most, was controlled by a tentative endogenous circannual rhythm. On the other hand, experimentally-determined thermal effects were able to quantitatively predict much of the summer-winter fluctuation observed in the field and mesocosms. Importantly, however, temperature was insufficient to fully predict, and occasionally was a poor predictor of, natural patterns. Thermal effects can thus be overridden by other (unidentified) natural environmental variation and do not take the form of an unavoidable constraint due to cold-blooded physiology. This is consistent with a context-dependent strategic control of immunity in response to temperature variation, and points to the existence of temperature-sensitive regulatory circuits that might be conserved in other vertebrates.",,,,,"; Cable, Joanne/A-4360-2010","Hablutzel, Pascal/0000-0002-6739-4994; Cable, Joanne/0000-0002-8510-7055; Jackson, Ida/0000-0002-3139-7384",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-3224,,,,,MAR 22,2018,9,,,,,,,,582,10.3389/fimmu.2018.00582,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00582,,,,,,,,29623078,,,,,WOS:000428058800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In 2003, a 27% throughfall exclusion experiment was installed in a Quercus ilex L. forest in France. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were estimated in a control and a dry treatment. Decreasing throughfall decreased GPP by 14% and had a smaller effect on R-ECO (-12%), especially soil respiration R-S (-11%). Interannual variability of GPP (29%) was higher than for R-ECO (12%). Error propagation was used to estimates uncertainties in the NEE fluxes, which ranged from 3% to 10% in the control treatment but up to 167% for NEE in the dry treatment because more steps and data types were involved in the scaling. After 3 years of throughfall exclusion, we found no acclimation of R-S to climatic drivers. Functional properties of the response of R-S to soil water, temperature and rain pulse remained similar in the control and the dry treatments. A diurnal clockwise hysteresis in R-S was probably controlled by canopy photosynthesis with a 3 h lag. The proportion of diurnal variation of respiration due to photosynthesis was similar in all treatments (4-5%). Because of the characteristic of rain in Mediterranean climates, a continuous decrease of water input in these environments have an effect on topsoil water and consequently on R-S only during short periods when rainfall is characterized by infrequent and small events that does not allow the topsoil to reach field capacity and does not allow to dry completely. However, in the longer term, we expect a stronger decrease in R-S in the dry treatment driven by the decrease in GPP.",,,,,"Rambal, Serge/H-5705-2019","Rambal, Serge/0000-0001-5869-8382",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,SEP,2010,16,9,,,,,2461,2475,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02121.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02121.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000280633700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

To improve the sampling efficiency for the C-2 compounds, a cooling device, based on Peltier cooling was constructed, which could be operated at a temperature down to -30 degrees C. Experiments under laboratory and field conditions were carried out to study the influence of the sampling temperature on the recovery of ethane and ethene as the most volatile VOCs. The results clearly demonstrate the need for a cooled sampling device for the analysis of C-2 compounds in air. Under the investigated conditions, the recoveries with ambient temperature sampling were only in the range of 38-46% for ethane and 33-59% for ethene respectively, in comparison to the cooled sampling device. These findings are only valid for the described conditions and can change significantly with temperature and concentration. A generalisation of the recovery is thus very difficult to give.

Seeds were exposed to a 12 h photoperiod in Petri plates within germination chambers for 57 days. In the second experiment, photoperiod (12,14, or 24 h light), water depth (0 or 4 cm; S. acutus only), temperature, and bleach pretreatment were further evaluated. Cold, wet storage (CWS) and bleach treatment significantly improved germination (84 to 100%) of A. gramineum and led to quicker germination. Bleach treatment for 5 days significantly increased germination (13%) for S. acutus at 15 degrees C. Temperature effects varied with species. Inundation of seeds significantly improved germination of S. acutus. For both Schoenoplectus species, germination was highest at daily fluctuating temperatures of 32-38 degrees C.

Population size of D. magna populations decreased with unpredictability of thermal conditions; the highest density of D. magna was found in the warm environment and the lowest density in the stochastic environment. Thermal regime had significant impact on the prevalence of asexual and sexual reproduction of D. magna. Under a synchronous regime, an accumulation of asexual reproduction was observed during cold episodes; this was followed by a phase of population disturbance, manifesting itself in high fluctuations of asexual reproduction and a pattern of sexual reproduction typical of a cold regime. Under a stochastic regime, the population disturbances were observed throughout the duration of the experiment. Daily observations of individual life history traits revealed that the development of populations under different thermal regimes resulted from the regime-specific survivability of neonates. Population development was also affected by the frequency of reproduction, which consisted of the number of broods carried per lifetime. The results indicate that not only temperature but also shifts in thermal conditions have an important influence on individual life history traits and population dynamics of D. magna. It is important to consider the effects of shifts in water temperature on demographic and individual traits simultaneously because the impact of thermal changes on population traits can be modified by individual life histories.

Soil respiration was determined by closed-chamber technique with three replicates in each experimental plot and was measured twice in a month from April 2010 till March 2011. This study showed that land cover change had no effect on soil diurnal and seasonal respiration behaviour. Diurnal variation in soil respiration was largely fluctuated in teak plantation compared with mixed deciduous forest. Seasonally, soil respiration values were 326.8 and 313.2 g C m(-2) year(-1) (136.7 and 131.0 mg CO2 m(-2) hour(-1)) in the teak plantation and mixed deciduous forest respectively. There were seasonal variations in soil respiration at both sites; soil respiration in the wet season was significantly higher than that in the dry season (p = 0.011 and 0.005 in teak plantation and mixed deciduous forest respectively). On the other hand, differences in soil respiration between teak plantation and mixed deciduous forest were not significant in the wet and dry seasons. Soil moisture was a major factor influencing seasonal variation of soil respiration while soil temperature played a key role in controlling diurnal variation. Soil respiration in mixed deciduous forest was more sensitive to change in soil temperature (Q(10) = 2.02) than that in teak plantation (Q(10) = 1.63) due to large soil respiration variation in mixed deciduous forest observed during the early wet season.",,,,,,"Diloksumpun, Sapit/0000-0002-2139-7591",,,,,,,,,,,,,0128-1283,2521-9847,,,,JUL,2013,25,3,,,,,339,349,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000324006600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

At continuous exposure to low temperatures, permanent reduction of ATP content occurred between days 7 and 10, while EL increased significantly between days 4 to 7 (depending on experimental conditions). Of three leaves differing in age, most injuries were found in the oldest leaf. An increased intensity of irradiation from 150 to 500 mu E . m(-2). s(-1) caused an earlier decrease in the ATP content and a further increase in electrolyte leakage. ATP content showed a 24 h rhythm, it increased at the end of the night and decreased at the end of the day. The rhythm was particularly noticeable in the control plants (20 degrees C), as well as, however to a lesser extent, in plants exposed to daily fluctuating chilling temperatures. It has also been observed that higher temperatures occurring in day time may diminish electrolyte leakage induced by previous low temperatures. The intensity of F, determined at 20 degrees C, 4 h after withdrawal of chilling, decreased with the prolongation of the chilling period during the day. Thus, it may be assumed that the EL and F-n values as indicators of the plants' sensitivity are in better agreement with the induced chill doses than the ATP content in leaves, which to a greater extent depends on the interaction between chilling and other experimental factors, such as irradiation intensity or the sequence of light and darkness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0931-2250,,,,,SEP,1995,175,2,,,,,109,117,,10.1111/j.1439-037X.1995.tb01136.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-037X.1995.tb01136.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995TE91500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The wind, disturbing the trajectory of the falling water droplets or snowflakes above the rain gauge, is the major source of error, but when tipping-bucket recording gauges are used, the induced evaporation due to the heating device must also be taken into account. Manual measurements of fresh snow water equivalent (SWE) were taken in Alpine areas of Valtellina and Vallecamonica, in Northern Italy, and compared with daily precipitation and melted snow measured by manual precipitation gauges and by mechanical and electronic heated tipping-bucket recording gauges without any wind-shield: all of these gauges underestimated the SWE in a range between 15% and 66%. In some experimental monitoring sites, instead, electronic weighing storage gauges with Alter-type wind-shields are coupled with snow pillows data: daily SWE measurements from these instruments are in good agreement. In order to correct the historical data series of precipitation affected by systematic errors in snowfall measurements, a simple 'at-site' and instrument-dependent model was first developed that applies a correction factor as a function of daily air temperature, which is an index of the solid/liquid precipitation type. The threshold air temperatures were estimated through a statistical analysis of snow field observations. The correction model applied to daily observations led to 5-37% total annual precipitation increments, growing with altitude (1740 divided by 2190 m above sea level, a.s.l.) and wind exposure. A second 'climatological` correction model based on daily air temperature and wind speed was proposed, leading to errors only slightly higher than those obtained for the at-site corrections.",,,,,"RANZI, Roberto/A-1594-2009; Grossi, Giovanna/D-4381-2009","RANZI, Roberto/0000-0002-7408-9891; Grossi, Giovanna/0000-0001-7908-3811",,,,,,,,,,,,,2073-4441,,,,,JUL,2017,9,7,,,,,,,461,10.3390/w9070461,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9070461,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000406681700012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we studied the role of an internal factor, thyroid hormones and the possible thyroid-gonadal interrelationships, in animals captured on Zembra Island and maintained in natural conditions of photoperiod and temperature. We determined the seasonal profile of the thyroid and testis cycles and investigated the effects of castration and thyroidectomy on the seasonal testosterone and thyroxine cycles. Plasma thyroxine and testosterone levels followed similar, parallel seasonal patterns, with a peak in autumn (October) and low values from January to August. In thyroidectornized animals, plasma testosterone levels, although significantly higher than those in controls (P < 0.001), remained low throughout the 13 mo of the experiment, and no testicular reactivation was observed in the fall. In castrated animals, despite the increase in thyroxine concentration in the 3 mo following castration (P < 0.01), plasma thyroxine levels remained low during the 2 yr of the study. We then investigated the combined effects of long days (116L:8D) and moderately high temperature (25degreesC) on these two endocrine axes. In constant gonado-inhibiting conditions (16L:8D), whether the temperature was kept constantly high or allowed to fluctuate naturally, no reactivation of the thyroid and testicular axes was observed in the fall. In control animals, the peaks of testosterone and thyroxine concentrations observed in September were larger (P < 0.001) than those in animals subjected to the same natural photoperiod conditions but with constantly high temperature. The lower level of autumnal testis stimulation (P < 0.001) in animals maintained in conditions of constant high temperature (25degreesC) may be attributed to the low thyroxine levels induced by high temperature. These results clearly confirm that the thyroid and testicular cycles display similar seasonal variations and show that the thyroid and gonadal axes are strictly interdependent. This study provides the first demonstration, for a given species, that the seasonal reactivation of gonad activity is controlled by the thyroid, and thyroid activity,is controlled by the gonads.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3363,1529-7268,,,,APR,2004,70,4,,,,,1001,1009,,10.1095/biolreprod.103.020008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod.103.020008,,,,,,,,14656725,,,,,WOS:000220444000016,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Chen, PY",,,,"Chen, Pei-Yuan",,,Effects of meteorological variables and substrate moisture on evapotranspiration and thermal performance of a green roof in a subtropical climate,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,,,,,,,,,,,,"This study analyzed the correlations between the meteorological/substrate-moisture variables and the evapotranspiration (ET) to improve the understanding of the factors influencing the thermal performance of green roofs, including cooling the surface and interior temperature of the building, in a subtropical climate. Daily ET of the green roof had been estimated using the FAO Penman-Monteith method to increase the number of ET data and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient is 0.51-0.62 compared to the observed daily ET from data of green roof experiments in Taipei during December 2012 and September 2013. Based on correlation analysis, this study then suggests that ET may have a higher influence on Tdiff, i.e. the difference in surface temperatures of green and original roofs, than the meteorological variables or substrate water content (SWC), although the radiative heating is sometimes more influential to Tdiff than the cooling caused by ET of the green roof in thin substrate condition. This study also found that under wet and dry substrates, daily ET is highly correlated with weatherrelated variables and with SWC, respectively. Furthermore, because of the low insulation of wet substrate, more downward fluxes are sometimes found under high than low SWC conditions. On the contrary, under the dry substrate, increasing SWC helps reduce the downward fluxes. This study, therefore, indicates that an optimal range of substrate moisture appears to maximize the function of a green roof in reducing the surface temperature and the downward substrate-bottom flux. Considering that a counterbalance exists between SWC and ET as well as irrigation can be applied to control SWC, future studies could be aimed at the optimal range of SWC to execute informed irrigation concerning the thermal performance, water-saving irrigation, and storm-water-retention function of the green roofs either in dry period or before storm events.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0925-8574,1872-6992,,,,JUL,2022,180,,,,,,,,106663,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.106663,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.106663,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000795407700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Diuron is a widely used herbicide detected in freshwater ecosystems and may impact endocrine function in aquatic organisms. We evaluated the influence of temperature (28 and 34 degrees C) on the action of diuron and its metabolite 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) on thyroid function and metamorphosis in tadpoles of Lithobates catesbeianus. Exposure to both compounds induced more pronounced changes in gene expression and plasma 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T-3) concentrations in tadpoles treated at higher temperature. T-3 concentrations were increased in tadpoles exposed to 200 ng/L of diuron at 34 degrees C and an acceleration of metamorphosis was observed for the same group. Transcriptomic responses included alteration of thyroid hormone induced bZip protein (thibz), deiodinases (dio2, dio3), thyroid receptors (tr alpha, tr beta) and Kruppel-like factor 9 (klf9), suggesting regulation by temperature on TH-gene expression.

Few captive studies have however examined the early life-history of cephalopods in fluctuating temperatures as would be encountered in the wild. This study investigates the relationship between early growth and the significant factors affecting growth, namely food intake, food conversion and fluctuating environmental temperatures. Pale octopus (Octopus pallidus) hatchlings were reared in captivity under either a warming or cooling temperature regime. Individual variations and periodicity in feeding rates (F-r), food conversion rates (C-r), growth rates (G(r)), and the relationship between these variables and temperature were examined weekly. Food conversion rates were variable between individuals but also within individual octopus, which exhibited large fluctuations in C-r over time, exceeding 100% d(-1) in one instance. Although individual F-r, C-r and G(r) displayed fluctuations over time, there was no evidence of periodicity for any of the variables. Changes in temperature were not significantly correlated to changes in F-r, C-r or G(r). Feeding rate did not appear to influence growth rate or food conversion rate. Food conversion rate was negatively correlated to feeding rate in the same week, and positively correlated to growth rate. Short periods of low or no food consumption were common and the high values obtained for food conversion rate for some individuals suggest that octopus can grow substantially with little or no food intake. Individual variability observed in octopus growth may be dependent on the growth mechanism involved, specifically a fine balance between the continuous hyperplasic and hypertrophic growth found in cephalopods.

Year to year fluctuations around the increasing yield trend were substantial (st.dev. 591 kg/ha) and were highly correlated negatively with annual fluctuations in the average Tmin January to March (Tmin J-M) which ranged from 5.0 to 11.5 degrees C in this period lasting from mid tillering to early-mid grain fill. Dividing the 60-year period into three consecutive 20-year periods and using multiple linear regression improved the accuracy of estimates of FY as a linear function of time in each period (responding inter alia to better technology including breeding and agronomy), with slopes of 4.5%, 0.6%, and 1.8% p.a. for 1960-79, 1980-99, and 2000-19, respectively. Tmin J-M coefficients were -218, -413, -406 kg/ha/degrees C, or -5.9, -8.1, -6.6%/degrees C, respectively, with R-2 always close to 0.9. Combining results, the FY response to Tmin J-M was close to -7%/degrees C, such that over the 60-year period the Tmin J-M increase of 1.0 degrees C contributed a 7% reduction in FY at constant CO2. The improved estimate of FY slopes with respect to time revealed novel variation across the 60 year period to be dissected in a following paper. Annual fluctuations in Tmax J-M were not correlated with variation in Tmin J-M nor with variation in FY. Crop simulation modelling of potential yield (PY) corroborated the negative effect of increased Tmin J-M on yield and suggested that increased Tmin J-M primarily decreased days to anthesis, biomass and number of grains (/m2). Measurements retrieved from long term well-managed experiments in the Valley under constant agronomy and cultivars confirmed all the above predicted responses to Tmin J-M. Our results align with the few published studies increasing crop night temperature in the critical period of around 30 days up to the end of anthesis when grains/m(2), and hence yield, was inversely related to rate of development. In the Yaqui Valley this was strongly associated with Tmin variation.

For both diseases, vector control is the only tool for preventing epidemics since no vaccine or specific treatment is available. However, to efficiently implement control of mosquitoes vectors, a reliable estimation of the transmission risks is necessary. To become infective an Ae. aegypti female must ingest the virus during a blood meal and will not be able to transmit the virus during another blood-meal until the extrinsic incubation period is completed. Consequently the aged females will carry more infectious risks. The objectives of the present study were to estimate under controlled conditions the expectation of infective life for females and thus the transmission risks in relation with their reproductive cycle and parity status. Methodology/Principal Findings Larvae of Ae. aegypti were collected in central Guadeloupe and breed under laboratory conditions until adult emergence. The experiments were performed at constant temperatures (+/- 1.5 degrees C) of 24 degrees C, 27 degrees C and 30 degrees C on adults females from first generation (F1). Females were kept and fed individually and records of blood-feeding, egg-laying and survival were done daily. Some females were dissected at different physiological stages to observe the ovaries development. The data were analyzed to follow the evolution of parity rates, the number of gonotrophic cycles, the fecundity and to study the mean expectation of life and the mean expectation of infective life for Ae. aegypti females according to temperatures. The expectation of life varies with the parity rates and according to the temperatures, with durations from about 10 days at low parity rates at the higher temperature to an optimal duration of about 35 days when 70% of females are parous at 27 degrees C. Infective life expectancy was found highly variable in the lower parous rates and again the optimal durations were found when more than 50% of females are parous for the mean temperatures of 27 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Conclusion Parity rates can be determined for field collected females and could be a good proxy of the expectation of infective life according to temperatures. However, for the same parity rates, the estimation of infective life expectation is very different between Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. Correlation of field parity rates with transmission risks requires absolutely to be based on Ae. aegypti models, since available Anopheles sp. models underestimate greatly the females longevity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,AUG 10,2015,10,8,,,,,,,e0135489,10.1371/journal.pone.0135489,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135489,,,,,,,,26258684,,,,,WOS:000359352600069,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is one of the most important cereal pests. In Brazil, the economic losses associated with this aphid result mainly from the transmission of the barley yellow dwarf viruses. Decision-making for the adoption of management measures must consider the initial population size, the potential for population increase, and the time when this population will reach levels at which the resulting damage is equal to the costs of control measures. Consequently, the establishment of management programmes and decision support systems should be based on models that estimate the potential population growth of this pest species. Temperature is one of the main factors that determine the growth rate of insect populations. Generally, controlled experiments are designed to examine the relationship of temperature at fixed intervals in relation to the development phases of insects. In nature, thermal regimes are not constant, and population growth is the result of a series of combined events. In this work, the effects of different thermal regimes on the population growth ofR. padiwere compared. An agent-based model was used to estimate population growth, and the parameters defined in controlled regimes were compared with fluctuating temperatures under natural conditions. The temperature-driven model presented here can serve as a tool to predict population growth and decision-making for aphid management. The model structure and the proposed experimental design allow the addition of modules and layers of factors that can progressively affect the populations of aphids to gradually improve the model.",,,,,"Lau, Douglas/K-5050-2012","Wiest, Roberto/0000-0001-7982-6603",,,,,,,,,,,,,1461-9555,1461-9563,,,,FEB,2021,23,1,,,,,59,69,,10.1111/afe.12404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.12404,,AUG 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000561680000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

L.",,,Performance of atmometers in estimating reference evapotranspiration in a semi-arid environment,AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"Evapotranspiration (ET) based irrigation scheduling requires accurate measurements of reference evapotranspiration. Mathematical formulas with localized weather data can be used to accurately predict alfalfa reference ET rates (mm h(-1) and mm d(-1)). When local meteorological data are unavailable, a physical measurement of ET can be taken with an atmometer. The objective of this study was to determine if a Model E atmometer (ETgage Company, Loveland, CO), equipped with a canvas #54 cover, could be used to effectively estimate alfalfa reference ET. The ASCE Standardized Alfalfa Reference ET Equation (ASCE ETrs) was used as the standard for comparison of atmometer ET values to determine atmometer performance. Four years of alfalfa ET, as determined by an atmometer (ETgage), were compared to ASCE ETrs. Daily as well as 2, 3, 5, and 7 day sums of daily ETgage and ASCE ET were compared using simple least-squares linear regression. Coefficients of determination (R-2) between daily ETgage and ASCE ETrs for all years were greater than or equal to 0.80. Throughout the study, the atmometer tended to underestimate ASCE ETrs. Average seasonal underestimation of ASCE ET measured by the atmometer ranged from 9.06% to 18.9%. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Bias Error (MBE) ranged from 1.14 to 1.82 mm d(-1) and -0.66 to -1.51 mm d(-1), respectively. The atmometer underestimated daily ASCE ETrs 88% of the time, with an average underestimation of 1.30 mm d(-1). Underestimation of ASCE ETrs measured by the atmometer occurred most often on days when mean daily horizontal wind speeds were greater than 2 m s(-1) and/or when mean daily air temperatures were below 20 C. The atmometer performed best when the alfalfa was at reference condition. Localized calibration equations for reference and non-reference conditions with a temperature correction were developed to improve accuracy, with average magnitude of MBE reduced from -0.97 mm d(-1) to 0.13 mm d(-1).

This toxic, red-tide dinoflagellate grew faster with higher temperatures, up to a maximum of approximately I division per day at 31 degreesC. Salinities above 15 psu had a lesser effect on growth rate, as might be expected for an estuarine species. Growth rates of cultures exposed to natural light and temperature fluctuations were comparable to laboratory cultures. The minimum N cell quota suggested that high N flux would be required to support bloom development. A literature survey of documented A. monilatum blooms indicated that within US waters, blooms occur in July-September in nearshore or estuarine regions of the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Atlantic coast. Temperature and salinity measured during blooms correspond to the optimal growth conditions of the laboratory cultures. Nevertheless, the occurrence of A. monilatum blooms is sporadic compared to the occurrence of seemingly optimal growth conditions.

Contrary to other thermoregulating devices, the temperature regulation is not carried out through the perfused medium but directly at the bottom of the chamber where a 3-cm(2) Peltier element has been placed. The element is driven by a dedicated electronic device which controls the amount and the direction of the current flowing across the Peltier thermocouple.

Rare genotypes that are temperature-sensitive will predictably be impacted by climate change more profoundly than common genotypes for which gene expression does not depend on temperature. Computer simulations were used in this study to analyze the impact of changing temperatures on a very rare melanic morph that expresses a temperature-sensitive phenotype and is found in an abundant fish species (Gambusia holbrooki). This numerical model assesses the frequency of the two natural color morphs, silver and black-spotted, over time and iterates in each generation, incorporating survival estimates for different life stages based upon data collected during empirical experiments. Using the current projections for mean surface temperature increase, which are 2.5 degrees F to 10.4 degrees F by the year 2100, the impact of warming environment on the mosquitofish population was analyzed. Three different climate warming scenarios were used to address annual temperature fluctuations and incorporate predicted temperature rise at correspondingly minimal, mid, and maximum levels. Our results indicate that increasing temperatures will seriously affect the rare color morph and in some cases will result in extinction. The minimal climate-warming scenario produced lower extinction risks for the rare morph; however, it still decreased the frequency of the rare genotype to minimal values. The mid-range warming scenario produced a higher risk of extinction, while the maximum warming scenario resulted in the extinction of the rare color morph. The results of this study shed light on the possibility that the effects of climate change may have important ramifications for rare genotypes in nature and will likely drive some rare species genotypes to extinction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,,,NOV 10,2018,387,,,,,,10,16,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.08.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.08.008,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000451653800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nonetheless, flow-through growth experiments conducted at a range of salinities under ambient light showed that G. vermiculophylla should be able to grow in most of the Baltic Sea. Growth declined only below a salinity of 5.5. High water temperatures in summer seem to reduce resistance against low salinity. Growth of G, vermiculophylla in the SW Baltic is limited by light and is only possible during summer and above a depth of 3 m. Drifting fragments are dispersed by currents. Either they sink to deeper waters, where they degrade, or they accumulate in shallow and sheltered waters, where they form perennial mats. These overgrow not only soft bottom sediments, but also stones, which are an important habitat to Fucus vesiculosus, the main native perennial alga in the Baltic Sea. As compared to F. vesiculosus, G. vermiculophylla seems to represent a preferred refuge for mesograzers and other invertebrates, particularly in winter. Nonetheless, feeding trials showed that potential grazers avoided G. vermiculophylla relative to F vesiculosus. Daily biomass uptake by grazers associated with G. vermiculophylla in nature did not exceed 2 g kg(-1) and is <11% of average daily net growth (18.5 g kg(-1)) in the first 2 m below sea level. Consequently, feeding may not be sufficient to control the spread of G. vermiculophylla in the SW Baltic.

J,"Ohara, N; Kawas, ML",,,,"Ohara, N; Kawas, ML",,,Field observations and numerical model experiments for the snowmelt process at a field site,ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,,,,,,,,,,,,"There are several levels of models for the snowmelt process in terms of the snow thermal structure: isothermal, bi-layered and multi-layered models. However, it is difficult to choose the appropriate level of complexity for application because the number of unknown variables is crucial in model handling. One of the major issues in energy balance snow models is the shape of the snow temperature vertical profile. This profile, if taken as a specified function, would simplify a snowmelt model calibration and computation significantly. In this study, in order to determine the appropriate representative snow vertical thermal profile, snow temperature measurements have been performed using five snow thermocouples placed vertically along an observation tower with insulating arms. Also, as a field experimental study of an energy balance snow model, the net radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed along with the vertical one dimensional snow temperature profile have been observed at a field site in Lake Tahoe Basin. The computational results correspond with the measured snow temperature profile and snow water equivalent reasonably well. It is illustrated that the temperature in the snow near surface (called the active layer) varies daily, and the lower snow layer (called the inactive layer) is barely affected by the atmosphere. The results of field observations and the numerical experiments show that the vertical temperature distributions in the active layer, which is the upper layer affected by energy exchange with the atmosphere, generally have an exponential shape during night time under cold weather, while snow pack stays around 0 degrees C during daytime. Both of the results indicate that not only the snow temperature in the top active layer, but also the thickness of snow active layer fluctuates during the snowmelt process. The observation results show that the thickness of the active layer may reach about 60 cm in Sierra Nevada, California. These results provide significant information for the development of appropriate approximations in physically based snowmelt modeling. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Traffic controllers are at high risk for pollution exposure during outdoor work shifts. Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between air pollution and systemic blood pressure in traffic controllers during their work shifts. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 19 male traffic controllers from Santo Andre city (Sao Paulo, Brazil) who were 30-60 years old and exposed to ambient air during outdoor work shifts. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were measured every 15 min by an Ambulatory Arterial Blood Pressure Monitoring device. Hourly measurements (lags of 0-5 h) and the moving averages (2-5 h) of particulate matter (PM10), ozone (O-3) ambient concentrations and the acquired daily minimum temperature and humidity means from the Sao Paulo State Environmental Agency were correlated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Statistical methods included descriptive analysis and linear mixed effect models adjusted for temperature, humidity, work periods and time of day. Results: Interquartile increases of PM10 (33 mu g/m(3)) and O-3 (49 mu g/m(3)) levels were associated with increases in all arterial pressure parameters, ranging from 1.06 to 2.53 mmHg. PM10 concentration was associated with early effects (lag 0), mainly on systolic blood pressure. However, O-3 was weakly associated most consistently with diastolic blood pressure and with late cumulative effects. Conclusions: Santo Andre traffic controllers presented higher blood pressure readings while working their outdoor shifts during periods of exposure to ambient pollutant fluctuations. However, PM10 and O-3 induced cardiovascular effects demonstrated different time courses and end-point behaviors and probably acted through different mechanisms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The analysis provides insight of the usefulness of TOPMODEL as a predictive tool for future assessments of potential long-term changes in water yield as a result of changes in global climate. The evaluation was conducted by developing a calibration procedure to simulate a range of climatic extremes using historical temperature, precipitation, and streamflow records for years having wet, average, and dry precipitation amounts from the Leading Ridge (Pennsylvania), Fernow (West Virginia), and Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire) Experimental Watersheds. This strategy was chosen to determine whether the model could be successfully calibrated over a broad range of soil moisture conditions with the assumption that this would be representative of the sensitivity necessary to predict changes in streamflow under a variety of climate change scenarios. The model calibration was limited to a daily time step, yet performed reasonably well for each watershed. Model efficiency, a least squares measure of how well a model performs, averaged between 0.64 and 0.78. A simple test of the model whereby daily temperatures were increased by 1.7 degrees C, resulted in annual water yield decreases of 4 to 15 percent on the three watersheds. Although these results makes the assumption that the model components adequately describe the system, this version of TOPMODEL is capable to predict water yield impacts given subtle changes in the temperature regime. This suggests that adequate representations of the effects of climate change on water yield for regional assessment purposes can be expected using the TOPMODEL concept.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1093-474X,,,,,APR,1999,35,2,,,,,457,468,,10.1111/j.1752-1688.1999.tb03603.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1999.tb03603.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000080900700021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Functional responses provide a means to quantify resource use by consumers over short timescales and could therefore provide insight into how the effects of invasive species vary over space and time. Here, we use novel in situ microcosm experiments to track changes in the functional responses of two aquatic mesopredators, one native and the other an invader, as they undergo diel vertical migrations through a lake water column. The Ponto-Caspian mysid, Hemimysis anomala, a known ecologically damaging invader, generally had higher a functional response towards cladoceran prey than did a native trophic analogue, Mysis salemaai. However, this differential was spatiotemporally dependent, being minimal during the day on the lake bottom, and increasing at night, particularly inshore. Because the functional response of the native predator was spatiotemporally consistent, the above pattern was driven by changes in the invader functional response over the diel cycle. In particular, the functional response of H.anomala was significantly reduced on the lake bottom during the daytime relative to night, and predation was especially pronounced in shallow surface waters. We demonstrate the context dependency of the effects of an invasive predator on prey populations and emphasise the utility of functional responses as tools to inform our understanding of predator-prey interactions. In situ manipulations integrate experimental rigour with field relevance and have the potential to reveal how impacts manifest over a range of spatiotemporal scales.",,,,,"Emmerson, Mark Charles/ABD-6274-2021; macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020; Ricciardi, Anthony/A-8536-2010","Ricciardi, Anthony/0000-0003-1492-0054; Emmerson, Mark/0000-0003-1034-8572",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,OCT,2014,59,10,,,,,2194,2203,,10.1111/fwb.12423,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12423,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000342758300015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data from a crossbreeding experiment involving various genotypes derived from tropically adapted British, Sanga-derived, Zebu cross, Zebu and Continental beef cattle breeds were analysed to estimate variance components and genetic parameters of growth, adaptive and temperament traits. Breed group differences were accounted for by including fractional coefficients of direct and maternal additive and dominance genetic effects as covariates. In the univariate analyses, 6 models were compared ranging from the simplest model with animal as the only random effect to the full model comprising direct and maternal additive genetic variance and their covariance and the permanent environment effect due to dam (growth traits) and animal (adaptive and temperament traits). The heritability estimates were 0.41, 0.21, 0.19, 0.28, 0.41 and 0.15 for birth weight (BWT), weaning weight (WWT), preweaning average daily gain (PREADG), yearling weight (YWT), final weight at about 18 months of age (FWT) and post-weaning average daily gain (POADG), respectively. The maternal component of additive genetic variance as a proportion of phenotypic variance in BWT, WWT and PREADG was 0.15, 0.10 and 0.10, respectively. The heritability estimates for TICK, EPG, TEMP, COAT and FT were 0.13, 0.24, 0.12, 0.26 and 0.20, respectively. High positive genetic and phenotypic correlations were observed among growth traits. Low (insignificant) genetic correlations were observed between TICK, EPG and growth traits. However, genetic correlations between growth traits and heat tolerance traits (TEMP and COAT) were moderately negative implying that as the ability of an animal to handle heat stress increases, growth also increases at the genetic level. Genetic correlations among TICK, EPG and TEMP were moderately positive, suggesting that closely-linked genes affect these adaptive traits. The significant negative genetic relationship between TEMP and FT suggests that cattle with high heat resistance have desirable temperament. With the increasing crossbred populations in the northern Australian beef cattle industry, the best breeding strategy should aim to exploit both crossbreeding and within population selection to make improvements in growth, adaptive and temperament traits to increase overall productivity of the enterprise.",,,,,"Henshall, John/H-7539-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0816-1089,,,,,,2005,45,7-8,,,,,971,983,,10.1071/EA05045,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA05045,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000231472300026,View Full Record in Web of Science

Quantifying the environmental factors that affect the persistence of avian influenza virus is important for influencing our ability to predict future outbreaks and target surveillance and control methods. We conducted a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of the environmental factors that affect the decay of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in water. Abiotic factors affecting the persistence of LPAIV have been investigated for nearly 40 years, yet published data was produced by only 26 quantitative studies. These studies have been conducted by a small number of principal authors (n = 17) and have investigated a narrow range of environmental conditions, all of which were based in laboratories with limited reflection of natural conditions. The use of quantitative meta-analytic techniques provided the opportunity to assess persistence across a greater range of conditions than each individual study can achieve, through the estimation of mean effect-sizes and relationships among multiple variables. Temperature was the most influential variable, for both the strength and magnitude of the effect-size. Moderator variables explained a large proportion of the heterogeneity among effect-sizes. Salinity and pH were important factors, although future work is required to broaden the range of abiotic factors examined, as well as including further diurnal variation and greater environmental realism generally. We were unable to extract a quantitative effect-size estimate for approximately half (50.4%) of the reported experimental outcomes and we strongly recommend a minimum set of quantitative reporting to be included in all studies, which will allow robust assimilation and analysis of future findings.

Because desert microinvertebrates can mediate nutrient cycling, and the autotrophic components of crusts are known to be sensitive to rapid desiccation due to elevated temperatures after wetting events, we studied whether altered soil temperature and frequency of summer precipitation can also affect the composition of food web consumer functional groups. We conducted a two-year field study with experimentally-elevated temperature and frequency of summer precipitation in the Colorado Plateau desert, measuring the change in abundance of nematodes, protozoans, and microarthropods. We hypothesized that microfauna would be more adversely affected by the combination of elevated temperature and frequency of summer precipitation than either effect alone, as found previously for phototrophic crust biota. Microfauna experienced normal seasonal fluctuations in abundance, but the effect of elevated temperature and frequency of summer precipitation was statistically non-significant for most microfaunal groups, except amoebae. The seasonal increase in abundance of amoebae was reduced with combined elevated temperature and increased frequency of summer precipitation compared to either treatment alone, but comparable with control (untreated) plots. Based on our findings, we suggest that desert soil microfauna are relatively more tolerant to increases in ambient temperature and frequency of summer precipitation than the autotrophic components of biological soil crust at the surface.

We built artificial consortia out of one to six bacterial strains isolated at 4 degrees C through combinatorial biodiversity experiments. Increasing species richness resulted in improved sCOD removal efficiency (i.e., 0.266 +/- 0.146, 0.542 +/- 0.155, 0.742 +/- 0.136, 0.822 +/- 0.019 for mono-, tri-, penta-and hexacultures, respectively) and higher biomass gross yields (i.e., 0.065 +/- 0.052, 0.132 +/- 0.046, 0.173 +/- 0.049, 0.216 +/- 0.019 for mono-, tri-, penta,- and hexacultures, respectively). This positive relationship between biodiversity, sCOD removal and biomass gross yield was also observed when considering metabolic profiling (functional diversity) or evolutionary relationships (phylogenetic diversity). The positive effect of biodiversity on sCOD removal efficiency could be attributed to the selection of a particular, best-performing species (i.e.,Pedobactersp.) as well as complementary use of carbon resources among consortia members (i.e., complementarity effects). Among the biodiversity indices, PD diversity metrics explained higher variation in sCOD removal than SR and FD diversity metrics. For a more effective bioaugmentation, our results stress the importance of using phylogenetically diverse consortia, with an increased degradation ability, instead of single pure cultures. Moreover, PD could be used as an assembly rule to guide the composition of mixed cultures for wastewater bioaugmentation under psychrophilic conditions.",,,,,"Agathos, Spiros/D-6477-2015","Agathos, Spiros/0000-0001-7245-0594; Stenuit, Benoit/0000-0002-0326-5544",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-302X,,,,JUL 24,2020,11,,,,,,,,1490,10.3389/fmicb.2020.01490,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01490,,,,,,,,32793129,,,,,WOS:000560576500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature, light and desiccation were investigated to elucidate their role in the germination ecophysiology of these species. The effect of different seasonal temperatures, seasonal durations, temperature fluctuations, the presence of light during different seasons and intermittent drying (during the summer period) over several years' on seed germination was investigated with outdoor and laboratory experiments. Warm summer-like temperatures (20 degrees C) were necessary for germination at subsequent cooler autumn-like temperatures (greatest at 15 degrees C in G.nivalis and 10 degrees C in N.pseudonarcissus). As the warm temperature duration increased, so did germination at subsequent cooler temperatures; further germination occurred in subsequent years' at cooler temperatures following a second, and also third, warm period. Germination was significantly greater in darkness, particularly in G.nivalis. Dormancy increased with seed maturation period in G.nivalis, because seeds extracted from green capsules germinated more readily than those from yellow capsules. Desiccation increased dormancy in an increasing proportion of N.pseudonarcissus seeds the later they were dried in summer'. Seed viability was only slightly reduced by desiccation in N.pseudonarcissus, but was poor and variable in G.nivalis. Shoot formation occurred both at the temperature at which germination was greatest and also if 5 degrees C cooler. In summary, continuous hydration of seeds of both species during warm summer-like temperatures results in the gradual release of seed dormancy; thereafter, darkness and cooler temperatures promote germination. Cold temperatures, increased seed maturity (G.nivalis) and desiccation (N.pseudonarcissus) increase dormancy, and light inhibits germination.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 177, 246-262.",,,,,"Newton, Rosemary/F-4390-2010; Hay, Fiona/AAC-2104-2022","Newton, Rosemary/0000-0003-3952-3805; Hay, Fiona/0000-0002-3118-897X; Ellis, Richard/0000-0002-3695-6894",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-4074,1095-8339,,,,FEB,2015,177,2,,,,,246,262,,10.1111/boj.12240,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/boj.12240,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000349076100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the lowest salinity (S = 0.5, T = 20 degrees C) and temperature (T = 10 degrees C, S = 2.4), they were also more abundant on the surface of the sediment, however the differences in relation to control conditions (S = 2.4, T = 20 degrees C) were not significant (p > .05). Clams kept their shells open in the lowest salinity, but closed in the highest salinity and at lower temperature. The closure time was longer in salinity of 10.0 than at temperature of 10 degrees C, where the highest reduction in the metabolic rate occurred in relation to the control conditions. This latter fact, in combination with shell closure, may indicate the activation of an anaerobic pathway. Thus, in the long term, lower temperatures may adversely affect R. cuneata, especially at very low salinity (S = 0.5, 2.4), in which this hyper-osmoregulating species has to strongly pump water with ions and oxygen to compensate for energy demand. In salinity of 10.0, where the species is isosmotic to the environment, changes in behaviour (moving to the sediment surface and closing the shell) with a simultaneous reduction in the metabolic rate may be due to lower costs of osmoregulation.

However, to maintain optimal growth in greenhouses, the temperature must be closely monitored. We evaluated the use of near-infrared reflecting greenhouse film, which controls fluctuations in air temperature. The cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) cultivars `SHARP-1' and `Shinryu' were cultivated under near-infrared reflecting greenhouse (NIR) film and under natural light-type greenhouse film (control). The plant responses and environmental effects were compared for the two greenhouse film treatments. Both films differed by 9% in visible radiation transmission and 62% in NIR (800-2500 nm) radiation transmission. Total yield of `SHARP-1' per plant under the near-infrared reflecting greenhouse film was greater than under the control. The level of bent fruits among the plants grown under the near-infrared reflecting greenhouse film was lower than among the plants grown under the control. Additionally, the stem lengths of `Shinryu' plants under near-infrared reflecting greenhouse film were taller than under the control. There were no differences between the two greenhouse films in terms of the number of fruits per plant, and average fruit weight and leaf growth. The greatest temperature difference between the NIR film (39.5 degrees C) and the control film (40.2 degrees C) was 0.7 degrees C during the cultivation experiment. In addition, the greatest average leaf surface area was observed at 30.3 degrees C for the NIR film and at 30.9 degrees C for the control. The use of NIR film did not affect cucumber yields, but it did reduce air and soil temperatures. In the future, cucumber yields might be increased by the use of an improved film with greater transmission of photosynthetically active radiation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0567-7572,,978-94-62611-01-6,,,,2015,1107,,,,,,257,262,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1107.35,http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1107.35,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000378731500035,View Full Record in Web of Science

Egestion rates (0.017-0.049 mg faeces mg(-1) dry wt. mysid h(-1)) increased with increasing temperature (Q(10) values ranged from approximate to 1.9-2.4) and with increasing salinity.

Male egestion rates were not significantly different from those of females at any temperature/salinity combination. Absorption efficiency (approximate to 0.35) was unaffected by temperature or salinity, confirming that egestion rates are representative of energy acquisition by N. integer.

Effects of constant and fluctuating temperatures, soil matric potential, and soil type on the proliferation of F. oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli isolate EN4-FT from an alginate prill formulation were studied. Three or four soils were used: a Galestown gravelly loamy sand (GGLS), Hatboro loamy sand (HLS), and red clay subsoil (RC) were collected in Beltsville, MD. A clay loam soil from a planting of coca in Hawaii (HCL) was substituted for RC soil in some experiments. Frill containing F. oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli were placed on the surface of GGLS, HLS, or HCL soils and maintained at -10, -100, or -500 kPa for 1 week. Matric potential and soil type significantly affected proliferation of the pathogen into the soils. Proliferation was greatest in HCL soil and least in HLS soil. The population density of F. oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli at -10 and -100 kPa was approximately 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/g, whereas the population density at -500 kPa was approximately 10(3) CFU/g. During 17 weeks of sampling GGLS, HLS, and RC soils maintained at -50 kPa, F. oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli proliferated from prill into soil when constant temperatures ranged from 10 to 32 degrees C, resulting in 10(3) to 10(5) CFU/g of soil after 1 wk of incubation. Optimum proliferation was at 25 degrees C in all soils. Compared to other temperatures, lower numbers of propagules were recovered from soils stored at 40 degrees C. Two regimes of fluctuating temperature (cycles of 12 h at 15 degrees C followed by 12 h at 25 degrees C or cycles of 12 h at 25 degrees C followed by 12 h at 35 degrees C) also were tested for their effect on proliferation of F. oxysporum f. sp. erythroxyli from prill into three soils maintained at -50 kPa. Population densities were initially 10(3) to 10(6) CFU/g of soil and declined over the 17-week test period. After 17 weeks, population densities in GGLS soil were greater than in HLS or RC soils in both temperature regimes. In HLS and RC soils, the number of CFU of F. oxysporum f. sp, erythroxyli per g was significantly higher in autoclaved than in nonautoclaved soil, indicating that these two soils were fungistatic.

Now, 30 years on, we demonstrate how the wealth of data collected during FIFE and its subsequent in-depth analysis in the literature continue to be a valuable resource for the current generation of land-surface models. To illustrate, we use the FIFE dataset to evaluate the representation of water stress on tallgrass prairie vegetation in the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) and highlight areas for future development. We show that, while JULES is able to simulate a decrease in net carbon assimilation and evapotranspiration during a dry spell, the shape of the diurnal cycle is not well captured. Evaluating the model parameters and results against this dataset provides a case study on the assumptions in calibrating unstressed vegetation parameters and thresholds for water stress. In particular, the responses to low water availability and high temperatures are calibrated separately. We also illustrate the effect of inherent uncertainties in key observables, such as leaf area index, soil moisture and soil properties.

Spikelet number was determined by an empirical function of dry weight and N concentration of above-ground biomass at the panicle formation stage, which was derived from a number of field experiments conducted in widely different regions in Japan. Data sets covering a range of N and climatic conditions were used for validation. The model, written in BASIC for PCs, satisfactorily simulated daily biomass growth and final spikelet number with inputs of latitude, N fertilizer input and daily climatological data, and might be useful for evaluation of N fertilizer management scenarios over sites and seasons.",,,,,"Hasegawa, Toshihiro/H-8211-2019","Hasegawa, Toshihiro/0000-0001-8501-5612",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0-7923-4286-0,,,,1997,6,,,,,,243,257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997BH23W00017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experimental data provide unique insights into how organisms respond to variation of environmental drivers. However, an assessment of how well experimental conditions cover the breadth of environmental conditions and variability where corals live successfully is missing. Here, we compiled and analyzed a globally distributed dataset of in-situ seasonal and diurnal variability of key environmental drivers (temperature, pCO(2), and O-2) critical for the growth and livelihood of reef-building corals. Using a meta-analysis approach, we compared the variability of environmental conditions assayed in coral experimental studies to current and projected conditions in their natural habitats. We found that annual temperature profiles projected for the end of the 21st century were characterized by distributional shifts in temperatures with warmer winters and longer warm periods in the summer, not just peak temperatures. Furthermore, short-term hourly fluctuations of temperature and pCO(2) may regularly expose corals to conditions beyond the projected average increases for the end of the 21st century. Coral reef sites varied in the degree of coupling between temperature, pCO(2), and dissolved O-2, which warrants site-specific, differentiated experimental approaches depending on the local hydrography and influence of biological processes on the carbonate system and O-2 availability. Our analysis highlights that a large portion of the natural environmental variability at short and long timescales is underexplored in experimental designs, which may provide a path to extend our understanding on the response of corals to global climate change.",,,,,"Rädecker, Nils/I-6462-2015; Voolstra, Christian R/H-7158-2014; Aranda Lastra, Manuel/D-9530-2011; Froelicher, Thomas/AAG-9598-2019; Duarte Quesada, Carlos Manuel/ABD-6208-2021; Anton, Andrea/ABA-3742-2021; Klein, Shannon/L-8536-2013; Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010; Duarte, Carlos M./A-7670-2013","Rädecker, Nils/0000-0002-2387-8567; Voolstra, Christian R/0000-0003-4555-3795; Aranda Lastra, Manuel/0000-0001-6673-016X; Froelicher, Thomas/0000-0003-2348-7854; Klein, Shannon/0000-0001-8190-3188; Anton, Andrea/0000-0002-4104-2966; Martin, Cecilia/0000-0002-3886-2824; Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053; saderne, vincent/0000-0003-3968-2718; Duarte, Carlos M./0000-0002-1213-1361",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,NOV,2021,27,21,,,,,5532,5546,,10.1111/gcb.15840,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15840,,SEP 2021,,,,,,34391212,,,,,WOS:000692462800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Variation in upper thermal limits can occur among and within species, and for social insects such as ants, within colonies. Within colonies, upper thermal limits may differ among individuals or change for an individual throughout the day. Daytime foragers of the Neotropical ant Ectatomma ruidum have higher critical thermal maxima (CTmax) than nocturnal foragers, but whether these differences occur among or within colonies was not previously known. We investigated the potential mechanisms accounting for day/night variation in CTmax of E. ruidum foragers by testing whether CTmax varied among or within colonies or due to individuals within colonies acclimating to changes in temperature over a short time scale (3 h). We found within- but not among-colony differences in CTmax on a diel cycle, and we found no evidence for among- or within-colony partitioning of foraging times by individual workers. Individuals did not acclimate to experimental manipulations of temperature, although additional experiments with more ecologically relevant temperature manipulations are needed to rule out this mechanism. In summary, we have shown that day/night differences in upper thermal limits can occur within ant colonies, but further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms driving this variation.",,,,,"McGlynn, Terrence/ABD-3939-2020","McGlynn, Terrence/0000-0002-4290-6156; Nelson, Ph.D., Annika S./0000-0002-1086-0077; Rana, Jignasha/0000-0001-8738-4462; Scott, Trey/0000-0001-6609-9638; Clifton, Elizabeth/0000-0002-3287-1666; Figueroa, Laura/0000-0003-0655-8278",,,,,,,,,,,,,0020-1812,1420-9098,,,,FEB,2018,65,1,,,,,183,189,,10.1007/s00040-017-0585-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00040-017-0585-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000423831700018,View Full Record in Web of Science

These larvae are phenotypically varied across their range with predominantly black larvae (southeastern USA and California) and red larvae (western Texas, Arizona) occurring in different regions. Two years of field observations in south Texas indicate that the proportion of red larvae increases with increasing daily temperatures as the growing season progresses. Larvae were also observed to shift their microhabitats by climbing on non-host vegetation and avoided excessive heat in their feeding microhabitat. Larvae of ten half-sib families from populations in south Texas and California, reared under different temperature regimes in common garden experiments, exhibited plasticity in larval phenotype, with larvae from both populations producing the red phenotype at temperatures greater than 30 degrees C and maintaining the black phenotype at cooler temperatures. However, larvae from Texas were more tolerant of higher temperatures, showing no decrease in growth rate in the highest temperature (maximum seasonal temperature) treatment, compared to the California population. In a field experiment, black larvae were found to have higher body temperatures when exposed to sunlight compared to red larvae. These results suggest that microhabitat shifts and the color polyphenism observed in pipevine swallowtail larvae may be the adaptive strategies that enable larvae to avoid critical thermal maximum temperatures.",,,,,,"Fordyce, James/0000-0002-2731-0418",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,JAN,2006,146,4,,,,,541,548,,10.1007/s00442-005-0229-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-005-0229-7,,,,,,,,16133191,,,,,WOS:000234145300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whereas processes important for dispersal in space are well known, knowledge of processes governing dispersal in time is still limited. Data for morphological seed traits such as size have given contradictory results for prediction of soil seed persistence or cover only a few species. There have been few experimental studies on the role of germination traits in determining soil seed persistence, while none has studied their predictive value consistently across species. Delayed germination, as well as light requirements for germination, have been suggested to contribute to the formation of persistent seed banks. Moreover, diurnally fluctuating temperatures can influence the timing of germination and are therefore linked to seed bank persistence. Methods The role of germination speed measured by T-50 (days to germination of 50% of all germinated seeds), light requirement and reaction to diurnally fluctuating temperatures in determining seed persistence in the soil was evaluated using an experimental comparative data set of 25 annual cereal weed species. Key Results It is shown that light requirements and slow germination are important features to maintain seeds ungerminated just after entering the soil, and hence influence survival of seeds in the soil. However, the detection of low diurnally fluctuating temperatures enhances soil seed bank persistence by limiting germination. Our data further suggest that the effect of diurnally fluctuating temperatures, as measured on seeds after dispersal and dry storage, is increasingly important to prevent fatal germination after longer burial periods. Conclusions These results underline the functional role of delayed germination and light for survival of seeds in the soil and hence their importance for shaping the first part of the seed decay curve. Our analyses highlight the detection of diurnally fluctuating temperatures as a third mechanism to achieve higher soil seed persistence after burial which interacts strongly with season. We therefore advocate focusing future research on mechanisms that favour soil seed persistence after longer burial times and moving from studies of morphological features to exploration of germination traits such as reaction to diurnally fluctuating temperatures.",,,,,"Dutoit, Thierry/AAB-7398-2019; Saatkamp, Arne/AAE-9829-2020; Poschlod, Peter/AAF-7902-2019","Dutoit, Thierry/0000-0001-9461-9215; Saatkamp, Arne/0000-0001-5638-0143",,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,MAR 11,2011,107,3,,,SI,,415,426,,10.1093/aob/mcq255,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcq255,,,,,,,,21224268,,,,,WOS:000287749600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

I studied the thermoregulatory behaviour of the diurnal basker Psammodromus algirus (Reptilia, Lacertidae) in the mosaic of sunshade patches of a Mediterranean evergreen forest. 48 behavioural sequences associated with measurements of the thermal environment provided data on the percentages of time spent basking by focal animals, the duration of individual basking periods and the frequency of basking. 2. The percentage of time basking decreased linearly from the onset of the activity period until midday. The average duration of basking periods had a pronounced decrease after 0700 h and remained constant throughout the rest of the morning, whereas the basking rates, that were minimal before 0700 h, reached a peak between 0700 and 0800 h followed by a progressive fall that continued until noon. 3. In order to explain these behavioural patterns, I experimentally determined the effects of environmental variables (air and ground temperature and solar angle) on the heating and cooling rates of captive lizards. The resulting regression models were then used to predict the heat exchange rates of the observed free-ranging animals. 4. The moment at which heating rates should equal and then exceed cooling rates, appeared to set off the behavioural shift towards a larger frequency of shorter basking periods. Under these circumstances, the apparently random movement of a shuttling heliotherm with respect to sun and shade might still be of thermoregulatory significance.",,,,,"Díaz, José A./H-5559-2015","Díaz, José A./0000-0001-6047-5065",,,,,,,,,,,,,0005-7959,,,,,AUG,1991,118,,1-2,,,,1,14,,10.1163/156853991X00166,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156853991X00166,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GG09500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study was conducted in central New Mexico to determine the effects of heavy infrequent defoliation of chemically thinned juniper woodland (Juniperus monosperma) on soil moisture. Each of three cattle-grazing exclosures (CD, FG, and KI) was instrumented: 1) beneath trees with a set of three soil moisture probes (0-25, 25-50, and 50-75 cm depth) and one soil temperature probe under live trees (control) and dead trees (herbicide-treated); and 2) between trees with one soil moisture and one soil temperature probe in control and herbicide-treated intercanopy plots. Each plot had three clipped and three unclipped subplots. Mean daily maximum surface soil temperature was highest (17.19 degrees C) in intercanopy, intermediate (16.13 degrees C) under herbicide-treated, and lowest (14.90 degrees C) under control trees. Topsoil moisture (0-25 cm depth) was different among treatment combinations from late July to early September 2006. Thus, the control unclipped combination had the highest topsoil moisture while the herbicide-treated unclipped combination had the lowest topsoil moisture. Comparing other depths, control unclipped plots had higher soil moisture in the middle layer (25-50 cm) and bottom layer (50-75 cm) than at the top from late August to early November 2006. Results imply that clipping on chemically thinned juniper woodlands does not increase soil moisture at any depth, yet macropore flow and water absorption on deep soil layers, underneath live trees, might help to store soil moisture for longer periods in water-limited environments.

The experiment was carried out at the Agricultural Experimental Station in Dehui, Jilin province. Two varieties, ZD 958 and ND 364 were planted in the field. The HLWP was measured by PSYPRO water potential apparatus during the key growing stages of maize. The diurnal change trend of HLWP was in a shape of parabola. The water potential was higher in the morning and the evening, and lower in the midday, with the highest value at 6:00 am and the lowest value at 10:00 am. Diurnal average HLWP for ZD 958 was lower than that for ND 364, while the change range of the former was higher than that of the latter. HLWP and relative water content (RWC) were declining along with the growing of maize, the change of water saturation deficit (WSD) was opposite. A linear relationship occurred between HLWP and WSD: y=A+Bx. The constant A for ZD 958 was less than that for ND 364, indicating that the former had lower WSD and higher RWC than the latter under normal water condition. ZD 958 had a smaller slope, which showed that WSD was affected less by water potential unit dynamics. Therefore, the dehydrate rates were relatively slower in husk leaves of ZD 958 under drought stress. There was a negatively significant correlation between HLWP and air temperature (T-A) as well as a positively significant correlation between HLWP and relative atmospheric humidity (R-H).

Both nitrification and denitrification produce N2O but their relative importance remains uncertain. Here we apply site preference, SP (the difference in delta N-15 between the central and outer N atom in N2O), to estimate the relative importance of bacterial denitrification (including nitrifier denitrification) to total N2O production from soil. We measured SP over a diurnal cycle following the third year of tillage of a previously uncultivated grassland soil at the Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) in southwestern Michigan. Fluxes of N2O in our study ranged between 7.8 and 12.1 g N2O-N ha(-1) d(-1) and were approximately 3 and 10 times greater than fluxes observed in managed agricultural and successional fields, respectively, at KBS. Consequently, our study captured a period of high flux resulting from the cultivation of a historically never-tilled soil. Concentration weighted SP values decreased from 12.9 parts per thousand in the morning to a minimum value of -0.1 parts per thousand in the afternoon. Based on SP values reported for bacterial denitrification (-5 to 0 parts per thousand; Toyoda et al., 2005: Sutka et al., 2006), hydroxylamine oxidation (nitrification) and fungal denitrification (33-37 parts per thousand; Sutka et al., 2006) we found that production attributable to bacterial denitrification increased from between 52.9 and 60.9% in the morning to between 87.5 and 100% in the afternoon. Further, we observed diurnal variation in flux and SP that is consistent with increased production from bacterial denitrification associated with temperature-driven increases in respiration.

We studied the roosting behaviour of rubyspot damselflies, Hetaerina americana, in relation to sex and territorial status, and conducted field experiments to test for specific mechanisms of roost formation and maintenance. Both sexes tended to return close to their previous night's roost, but only males were significantly more roost site faithful than chance expectations based on individual day ranges. Males were more roost site faithful when they held mating territories. After acquiring a territory, males usually began roosting closet: to the territory after a delay of a few days. Roosts were not located at sites that reduced the daily commuting distance between hunting areas and territories; males generally hunted closer to their territories than to their roosts. In field experiments, sites 'seeded' with synthetic models of male rubyspots attracted more recruits than vacant control sites and control sites seeded with nonrubyspot (clear-winged) damselfly models. Sites seeded repeatedly with rubyspot models often remained popular for roosting after the models were removed, suggesting that the models established new traditional roosts. These results indicate that conspecific attraction and individual spatial memory together may be sufficient to explain, at a proximate level, the traditional night roost aggregations of this species. We discuss these results in relation to functional hypotheses for roost site choice and fidelity.

We conducted a one-year field experiment to examine the effects of moss thickness on understory microclimates including ground surface temperature (GST), ground surface moisture (GSM), soil temperature (ST), and soil moisture (SM) in a Picea crassifolia forest of Qilian Mountains, northwest China. We found that moss coverage substantially reduced the fluctuation amplitudes of microclimates (p<0.01), as evidenced by the slower diurnal changes in GST, GSM, ST, and SM of moss-covered soil than those of bare soil. Moreover, our results also showed that moss coverage obviously increased GST and ST in winter (December 2014), whereas significantly decreased GST and ST in summer (June 2015). Comparing with bare soil, thick-moss coverage decreased the average annual GST and ST by 0.55 degrees C and 0.62 degrees C, respectively. However, moss coverage significantly increased the annual GSM and SM (p<0.01), especially the SM of thin-moss coverage was increased much higher than that of thick-moss coverage and bare soil. In addition, moss coverage may also prevent heat flux from air to soil surface because the light radiation was exponentially declined from the upper moss canopy to soil with the increase of moss depths. These results suggested that moss coverage may promote the microclimates of the forest understory with heat insulation and water holding, and thus facilitate the P. crassifolia germination and recruitment through changing the hydrological and ecological processes of subalpine forests.",,,,,"Zhao, Yuhao/ABC-7605-2021","Zhao, Yuhao/0000-0002-9014-5259",,,,,,,,,,,,,0556-3321,2070-3368,,,,OCT,2019,51,5,,,,,1719,1735,,10.30848/PJB2019-5(25),http://dx.doi.org/10.30848/PJB2019-5(25),,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000470692200023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Winter temperatures-might play an important role in survival during winter and hence population dynamics, yet to what degree is unknown. This study investigates the effect of exposure time, cold acclimation, and larval stage on survival at -5 and -10 degrees C. Exposure time at -5 degrees C was 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 days and 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h at -10 degrees C. Mortality increased with increasing exposure time and was significantly lower for cold-acclimated larvae. Estimated time until an expected mortality of 50%(LT50) and 90%(LT90) of larvae exposed to -5 degrees C was 7.4 and 9.6 days (non-acclimated) and 11.0 and 15.1 days (acclimated), respectively. Estimated LT50 for non-acclimated and acclimated larvae exposed to -10 degrees C was 32.6 and 70.5 h, respectively, and estimated LT90 66.8 and 132.2 h. Significant differences inmortality between larval stages were observed only at -5 degrees C. When exposed to -5 degrees C for 8 days, mortality of first and second instars was 81.2 and 51.3%, respectively. When exposed to -10 degrees C for 2 days, mortality of first and second instars was 70.5 and 76.1%.

Climate models project that the temperature of Atlantic deep waters could rise by 1-3 degrees C by 2100. In this context, understanding the effects of temperature on the physiology of cold-water species will help in evaluating their resilience to future oceanic changes. We investigated the response of L. pertusa to stepwise short-term increases in temperature. We sampled corals from four reefs, two located north of the Arctic circle and two at the mid-Norwegian shelf (boreal). In on-board experiments (one per reef), the sampled fragments were exposed to increasing temperatures from 5 to 15 degrees C over 58 h. Respiration increased linearly by threefold for a 10 degrees C increase. The short-term temperature increase did not induce mortality, cellular (neutral red assay for lysosome membrane stability; but one exception) or oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation assay) - to a few exceptions. However, the variability of the respiration responses depended on the experiment (i.e., reef location), possibly linked to the genetic structure of the individuals that we sampled (e.g., clones or siblings). The corals from the Arctic and boreal regions appear to have a high tolerance to the rapid temperature fluctuations they experience in the field. Over extended periods of time however, an increased metabolism could deplete the energy stored by the corals, if not met by an increased food availability and/or uptake. Empirical data on organisms' thermal performance curves, such as the one presented in this study for L. pertusa, will be useful to implement predictive models on the responses of species and populations to climate change.",,,,,"Buescher, Janina Vanessa/GQB-4689-2022","Buescher, Janina Vanessa/0000-0003-2399-4020; Dorey, Narimane/0000-0003-2814-1406",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-042X,,,,,JAN 21,2020,10,,,,,,,,1636,10.3389/fphys.2019.01636,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01636,,,,,,,,32038304,,,,,WOS:000510917700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Multiple dynamic growth and survival curves obtained under different fluctuating temperature conditions between 4 and 35 degrees C were used to determine the growth kinetics of SPA. In combination with appropriate secondary models, the study examined both growth and survival of SPA simultaneously by an integrated one-step approach using a set of differential equations. The estimated minimum growth temperature (T-min) of SPA was 8.91 degrees C, matching well with the growth characteristics of this microorganism. The growth at temperatures above T-min and the survival below T-min was accurately simulated by the predictive models. For model development, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.26 log CFU/g. The predictive models and kinetic parameters were validated using two dynamic growth and survival curves along with one isothermal thermal growth curve. The validation also showed that the models were accurate in predicting the growth and survival of the bacterium, With the RMSE of predictions only 0.52 log CFU/g. The errors of predictions were within normal experimental errors. The results of this work may be used to predict the change in the population of SPA in the marinated roasted chickens in the cold chain and during temperature abuse and to conduct risk assessment of this pathogen.

Light, especially blue light, increases the accumulation of anthocyanins and reduces postharvest decay in some fruits, but the effect of blue light on postharvest fruit quality attributes in blueberries is unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of blue light on fruit quality, anthocyanin accumulation and disease development during postharvest cold storage (2 degrees C-4 degrees C) in two experiments with southern highbush blueberry 'Star' and rabbiteye blueberry 'Alapaha'. Overall, diurnal blue light did not affect postharvest fruit quality attributes, such as visual defects, fruit compression, skin puncture, total soluble solid content and titratable acidity, in the two cultivars compared with their respective controls (diurnal white light or continuous darkness). Further, there was no effect of blue light on fruit color and anthocyanin accumulation. Fruit disease incidence in 'Star' ranged from 19.0% to 27.3% after 21 days and in 'Alapaha' from 44.9% to 56.2% after 24 days in postharvest storage, followed by 4 days at room temperature, but blue light had no consistent effect on postharvest disease incidence for either cultivar. Disease progression following artificial inoculations with Alternaria tenuissima and Colletotrichum acutatum in 'Star' was not influenced by light treatment prior to inoculation and during fruit storage. In a separate experiment, we tested the effect of blue light on color development in 'Farthing', a southern highbush blueberry cultivar with fruit prone to non-uniform ripening, whereby the stem-end remains green as the rest of the fruit turns blue. Although green stem-end spots turned blue over time, there was no statistically significant effect of the blue light treatment.

However, except for adrenocortical reactivity, little is known about other physiological responses to this potentially stressful procedure. Here, we focused on body temperature (Tb) in migratory songbirds, as large numbers are caught for population monitoring and studies of migratory biology. Tb is sensitive to acute stress in other vertebrates and contexts, usually showing an increase (stress-induced hyperthermia). We sampled garden warblers (Sylvia borin), whinchats (Saxicola rubetra) and barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) captured with mist nests using standard protocols at an island stopover site in the central Mediterranean during spring migration. Tb was measured within 3 min (T0), 30 min (T30) and 180 min (T180) from the time the bird hit the net, using an analogue probe inserted into the throat, and a body condition score was calculated for each bird. In the garden warbler, but not the other two species, a slight but significant reduction in Tb occurred after 180 min. In all species, the change in Tb after 3 h of confinement was positively correlated to the change in ambient temperature (Ta) but not to body condition. The mean (+/- SEM) change in Tb over 3 h was -1.68 (+/- O.16)degrees C for garden warblers, therefore within the expected range of normothermy in small birds. Such reduction in Tb is contrary to the expectation of stress-induced hyperthermia; these results suggest that garden warblers are able to modulate their body temperature and that these small changes are influenced by fluctuations in ambient temperature. Therefore, Tb might not be a good indicator of capture stress in small passerine migrants. Our results also indicate that restraint for ringing procedures is unlikely to have adverse effects on Tb regulation of migratory birds, if held within the time-frame typical of ringing operations.",,,,,"Tahamtani, Fernanda/J-6339-2019; Carere, Claudio/AAC-7830-2020; Maggini, Ivan/I-1744-2014","Tahamtani, Fernanda/0000-0002-4439-9733; Carere, Claudio/0000-0003-1644-2113; Maggini, Ivan/0000-0002-1528-2288",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-7286,,,,,MAY,2018,27,2,,,,,93,101,,10.7120/09627286.27.2.093,http://dx.doi.org/10.7120/09627286.27.2.093,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000433022800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

IHR fluctuations of newly hatched chicks have been categorized into three types: type I HR variability (HRV), which is high-frequency oscillation; type 11 HRV, which is low-frequency oscillation; and type III HR irregularities (HRI), which are irregular HR accelerations. The present experiment was carried out to investigate the origin of type II HR oscillations. Following previous evidence, we assumed that the low-frequency oscillation of FIR in newly hatched chicks was related to thermoregulation and changed by environmental temperature. Eventually, type H HRV was produced or augmented by exposure of hatchlings to lowered ambient temperature and was abolished by exposure to elevated environmental temperature. The hatchlings that were exposed to large temperature decreases tended to increase their HR more than those exposed to small temperature decreases, and vice versa. The HR oscillation accompanied by an elevation of HR baseline in response to cooling may be a phenomenon related to thermoregulation in chick hatchlings. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Germination tests were conducted in the laboratory with cold and wet stratified seeds in light and darkness, under four constant-temperature regimes and one fluctuating regime. Other germination tests were carried out in an experimental garden where freshly matured seeds sown on the soil surface were exposed to conditions typical for a sun-exposed site and a shaded (forest) site for 2 years. In the garden experiments, seeds at the sun-exposed site germinated soon after sowing in three species, whereas late-shedding species or species exhibiting primary dormancy germinated the following spring. Under the dense leaf canopy at the forest site, germination was inhibited completely during the first season in all species. Wet-forest species (Carer elongata, Carer remota) germinated the following spring before the leaf canopy closed, whereas the sedges adapted to open habitats (Carer canescens, Carer cespitosa, Carer pseudocyperus, Carer paniculata) failed to germinate, or only a low percentage germinated. Following transfer of ungerminated seeds from the shaded site to the sun-exposed site in the summer of the second year of the investigation, almost all of the hitherto ungerminated seeds germinated within 10 days. Results of laboratory experiments supported the findings in the garden experiments. At low mean temperatures (7 and 10 degrees C) in light, sedges adapted to open habitats did not germinate at all or showed a low percentage of germination, whereas forest sedges showed good germination. A high diurnal temperature amplitude and (or) a high constant temperature was needed to trigger the germination of a fraction of the seeds in dark treatments. It is suggested that the forest sedges are adapted to using a brief temporal regeneration niche during mid-spring, when mean temperatures are close to 10 degrees C and the leaf canopy has yet to close in central European, wet deciduous forests. In contrast, sedges adapted to open habitats probably fail to germinate under forest conditions because of their higher temperature requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0008-4026,,,,,OCT,1997,75,10,,,,,1692,1699,,10.1139/b97-883,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b97-883,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997YJ56100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

As the melt commences, the ice is partitioned into multiple surface types ranging from highly reflective white ice to absorptive blue ice. The reflectance from these surfaces shows significant spatial and temporal variability. Spectral albedo measurements were made at six different sites encompassing these two surface types, from 19 March to 3 May 2005, on 1.5 m thick landfast sea ice in southwestern Hudson Bay, Canada (58 degrees N). Furthermore, the broadband albedo and the surface energy balance were continuously recorded at a nearby site during the I month period. Rapid changes in the albedo were found to relate to typical subarctic climate conditions, i.e. frequent incursions of southerly air, resulting snow and rain events and the generally high maximum solar insolation levels. Subsequently, diurnal variations in snow surface temperature were evident, often causing daytime melting and night-time refreezing resulting in the formation of ice lenses and superimposed ice. After rain events and extensive melting, the snowpack was transformed throughout into melt/freeze metamorphosed snow and superimposed ice. The integrated (350-1050nm) albedo varied between 0.52 and 0.95 at the blue-ice sites, while it varied between 0.73 and 0.91 at white-ice sites. Variability on the order of +/- 10% in the white-ice broadband albedo resulted from the diurnal freeze-thaw cycle, but also synoptic weather events, such as snowfall and rain events, could rapidly change the surface conditions.",,,,,,"Granskog, Mats/0000-0002-5035-4347; Barber, David/0000-0001-9466-3291",,,,,,,,,,,,,0260-3055,,978-0-946417-39-1,,,,2006,44,,,,,,23,+,,10.3189/172756406781811376,http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756406781811376,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000246685800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This pattern, known as the temperature-size rule, is often accompanied by plastic changes in cell size, which can mechanistically explain the thermal dependence of body size. However, the theory predicts that thermal plasticity in cell size has adaptive value for ectotherms because there are different optimal cell-membrane-to-cell-volume ratios at different temperatures. At high temperatures, the demand for oxygen is high; therefore, a large membrane surface of small cells is beneficial because it allows high rates of oxygen transport into the cell. The metabolic costs of maintaining membranes become more important at low temperatures than at high temperatures, which favours large cells. In a field experiment, we manipulated the thermal conditions inside nests of the red mason bee, a solitary bee that does not regulate the temperature in its nests and whose larvae develop under ambient conditions. We assessed the effect of temperature on body mass and ommatidia size (our proxy of cell size). The body and cell sizes decreased in response to a higher mean temperature and greater temperature fluctuations. This finding is in accordance with predictions of the temperature-size rule and optimal cell size theory and suggests that both the mean temperature and the magnitude of temperature fluctuations are important for determining body and cell sizes. Additionally, we observed that males of the red mason bee tend to have larger ommatidia in relation to their body mass than females, which might play an important role during mating flight.",,,,,"Szentgyörgyi, Hajnalka/AAK-2579-2020; Czarnoleski, Marcin/H-2893-2015","Szentgyörgyi, Hajnalka/0000-0002-5753-800X; Czarnoleski, Marcin/0000-0003-2645-0360; Kierat, Justyna/0000-0003-4534-095X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4565,1879-0992,,,,AUG,2017,68,,A,,,,39,44,,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2016.11.008,,,,,,,,28689719,,,,,WOS:000405976100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Survival and developmental rate on horse-nettle and potato were measured for larvae from both colonies over a range of constant temperatures ( 12-30 degrees C) and one fluctuating temperature regime (22 degrees C to 30 degrees C). The ability of Colorado potato beetles to use horse-nettle as a larval host was strongly influenced by temperature, but the effects of temperature differed greatly between beetles from the two colonies. Survival of adapted larvae on horse-nettle was highest and comparable to that on potato at the constant 30 degrees C and the fluctuating temperature regime. Below 30 degrees C, survival of adapted larvae decreased drastically but some larvae survived at all temperatures except the lowest (12 degrees C). In contrast, survival of unadapted larvae to adult occurred only at 30 degrees C, and was low (10%). At lower temperatures, all larvae died. On potato, the effect of temperature was less dramatic, and consistent across colonies. At 12 degrees C, survival to adult was poor(ca. 10%), but at higher temperatures, survival increased sharply and larvae from both colonies survived equally well. On potato, small but statistically significant differences in developmental rates between beetle colonies were detected at the constant but not at the fluctuating temperature regimes. Also, the developmental day degree requirements (DD) and the low temperature development threshold (TO) values for the various developmental stages did not differ between colonies on potato. On horse-nettle, development times for both colonies were always significantly longer and DD requirements were greater than on potato. At 30 degrees C, the only constant temperature at which larvae from the unadapted colony completed development, the development rate to adult emergence was similar to that of beetles from the adapted colony. Differences between colonies in performance on horse-nettle were not a result of host-independent, genetically based differences in the thermal requirements of the two populations. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that adaptation to horse-nettle by Colorado potato beetle may be facilitated by a genotype x environment interaction involving temperature.

The saplings were exposed during winter to natural, square-curve fluctuating (between 1 and 11 degrees C with a 14 d interval), and constant (6 degrees C) temperatures with a natural and an extended (17 h) photoperiod. Frost hardiness of needles was determined by controlled freezing tests and visual damage scoring. The constant 6 degrees C temperature treatment caused a gradual dehardening of needles whereas under fluctuating temperatures the level of frost hardiness fluctuated. Trees exposed to extended photoperiods were less hardy than under natural photoperiods after the initiation of shoot elongation, but before this there were no clear differences in frost hardiness between different photoperiodic treatments. The results indicate that the Best hardening competence of Scots pine changes during quiescence.

A living wall has been introduced as an appropriate way to reduce the urban heat island phenomenon. To achieve the purpose, a living wall was applied to the body of a controllable chamber, and two data loggers for temperature and humidity were used. In the first experiment, three types of walls, including a wall without plants, a wall with panels and a living wall, are compared for three consecutive days. In the second experiment, a device is placed adjacent to the living wall and another is placed in the same condition in front of a part of the wall that does not have plants. These data were recorded for 24 h a day over 10 days and compared. This research was conducted in Shiraz, Iran, which has a hot, semi-arid climate. To validate the results, a computer simulation with the ENVI-met program was used. The results show that the panel living wall system can reduce the ambient air temperature by up to 8.7 degrees C. Additionally, the living wall reduces the temperature fluctuations by decreasing the maximum and increasing the minimum temperatures of the ambient air. During the hours of solar radiation, the temperature dropped by an average of 2.59 degrees C.

Heat-transfermodels describe how the fish's internal temperature responds to a fluctuating thermal environment. Specifically, the rate coefficient (k), defined as the instantaneous rate of change in body temperature in relation to the difference between ambient and body temperature, summarizes the combined effects of direct thermal conduction through body mass, passive convection (intracellular and intercellular fluids) and forced convective heat transfer (cardiovascular system). The k-coefficient is widely used in fish ecology to understand howbody temperature responds to changes in water temperature. The main objective of this study was to estimate the k-coefficient of brook charr equipped with internal temperature-sensitive transmitters in controlled laboratory experiments. Fish were first transferred from acclimation tanks (10 degrees C) to tanks at 14, 19 or 23 degrees C (warming experiments) and were then returned to the acclimation tanks (10 degrees C; cooling experiments), thus producing six step changes in ambient temperature. We used non-linear mixed models to estimate the k-coefficient. Model comparisons indicated that the model incorporating the k-coefficient as a function of absolute temperature difference (dT: 4, 9 and 13 degrees C) best described body temperature change. By simulating body temperature in a heterogeneous thermal environment, we provide theoretical predictions of maximum excursion duration between feeding and resting areas. Our simulations suggest that short (i.e. <60 min) excursions could be a common thermoregulatory behaviour adopted by cold freshwater fish species to sustain body temperature below a critical temperature threshold, enabling them to exploit resources in an unfavourable thermal environment.",,,,,"Magnan, Pierre/U-9342-2019","Magnan, Pierre/0000-0003-3122-7163",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,NOV,2015,218,21,,,,,3461,3467,,10.1242/jeb.126466,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.126466,,,,,,,,26347550,,,,,WOS:000364791100024,View Full Record in Web of Science

The dates of the start of flowering and maturity, the yield data, the average daily temperatures and precipitation were collected, and the Selyaninov hydrothermal coefficients were calculated during a fifteen-year study (2005-2020 growing seasons). During the experiment, highly variable weather conditions occurred, strongly modifying the course of phenological phases in soybean and the achieved seed yield of Augusta cultivar. The harvesting of mature soybean seeds took place between 131 and 156 days after sowing, while the harvested yield ranged from 0.6 t.ha(-1) to 2.6 t.ha(-1). The sensitivity analysis of the MLP neural network made it possible to identify the factors which had the greatest impact on the tested dependent variables among all the analyzed factors. It was revealed that the variables assigned ranks 1 and 2 in the sensitivity analysis of the neural network forming the M_HARV model were total rainfall in the first decade of June and the first decade of August.

MBO was the dominant daylight terpenoid emission, comprising on average 87 % of the total flux, and diurnal variations were largely determined by light and temperature. During daytime, oxygenated monoterpenes (especially linalool) comprised up to 75 % of the total monoterpenoid flux from needles. A significant fraction of monoterpenoid emissions was dependent on light and (CO2)-C-13 labeling studies confirmed de novo production. Thus, modeling of monoterpenoid emissions required a hybrid model in which a significant fraction of emissions was dependent on both light and temperature, while the remainder was dependent on temperature alone. Experiments in which stomata were forced to close using abscisic acid demonstrated that MBO and a large fraction of the monoterpene flux, presumably linalool, could be limited at the scale of seconds to minutes by stomatal conductance. Using a previously published model of terpenoid emissions, which explicitly accounts for the physico-chemical properties of emitted compounds, we were able to simulate these observed stomatal effects, whether induced experimentally or arising under naturally fluctuation conditions of temperature and light. This study shows unequivocally that, under naturally occurring field conditions, de novo light-dependent monoterpenes comprise a significant fraction of emissions in ponderosa pine.

Simultaneously black ash forested wetlands are expected to lose much of their overstory canopy due to the invasive Emerald Ash Borer (EAB). Field experiments and modeling efforts have provided information on species tolerance of post-EAB conditions and future climate adapted species. No studies have yet examined the interaction of the loss of ash and future climate scenarios on wetland hydrologic conditions. We developed daily wetland hydrology models for three vegetation conditions: black ash forest, alternate non-ash forest, and non-forested. Model simulations were evaluated under current climate conditions and under two future climate scenarios representing warm & dry (T: +1.9 degrees C, P: -2.6 cm) and hot & wet (T: +8.9 degrees C, P: +6.2 cm) scenarios. For each combination of vegetation condition and climate scenario, 10,000 annual synthetic weather sequences were used as inputs to the wetland hydrology models. Simulated wetland hydrology remained highly variable based on seasonal precipitation and evaporative demand. We compared the occurrence probability of stream-network connectivity, surface inundation, and dry conditions. Effects ranged from slightly drier under non-forested and warm & dry conditions to much wetter under alternate-forested and hot & wet conditions. Non-forested conditions resulted in a median increase of 15 and 20% of daily observations of connectivity to stream networks and surface inundation, respectively, and 7% (median) fewer daily observations of dry conditions. Alternate-forested conditions resulted in larger median impacts: 40 and 35% more daily observations of connectivity to stream networks and surface inundation, respectively and 10% fewer daily observations of dry conditions. Projected climate change-induced water deficits resulted in 3-9% fewer days with connectivity and surface inundation, respectively and 0-10% more days with dry conditions (values represent the range of median values for combination of vegetation and future scenario). Our results show vegetation change as an equal or greater individual driver of future hydrologic conditions in black ash wetlands relative to climate change. Non-forested conditions and projected climate change-induced impacts each effectively negated the other. Management decisions around vegetation transition and establishment should consider the interaction with future climate scenarios and the large effect that poorly inundation-adapted plant communities could have on hydrologic conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2624-893X,,,,AUG 18,2022,5,,,,,,,,957526,10.3389/ffgc.2022.957526,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2022.957526,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000848093900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

At some sites, ozone at 40 km appears to have increased since 2000, consistent with the beginning decline of stratospheric chlorine. The phaseout of chlorofluorocarbons after the International Montreal Protocol in 1987 has been successful, and is now showing positive effects on ozone in the upper stratosphere. Temperature anomalies near 40 km altitude from European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast reanalyses (ERA-40), from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational analyses, and from HALOE and lidar measurements show good consistency at the five stations, within about 3 K. Since about 1985, upper stratospheric temperatures have been fluctuating around a constant level at all five NDACC stations. This non-decline of upper stratospheric temperatures is a significant change from the more or less linear cooling of the upper stratosphere up until the mid-1990s, reported in previous trend assessments. It is also at odds with the almost linear 1 K per decade cooling simulated over the entire 1979-2010 period by chemistry-climate models (CCMs).

Using these field data to parameterize experimental work we demonstrate that air temperature and mussel size strongly influence this acidosis, with larger mussels at higher temperatures experiencing greater acidosis. There was a small inter-active effect of prior immersion in OA conditions (pH(NBS) 7.7/pCO(2) 930 mu atm) such that the haemolymph pH measured at the start of emersion was lower in large mussels exposed to OA. Critically, the acidosis induced in mussels during emersion in situ was greater (Delta pH approximately 0.8 units) than that induced by experimental OA (Delta pH approximately 0.1 units).

Temperature had a positive, significant, effect on heart rate; the Q(10) ranged from 2.5 to 2.6. Salinity, over a wide range (15-35parts per thousand), had no significant influence on heart rate reflecting the species' euryhalinity. Reduced oxygen tensions, either induced by emersion or seawater hypoxia, elicited rapid, significant, bradycardia. Positive inotropisms (indicative of greater heart output) were evident during seawater hypoxia and may represent an energetically advantageous mechanism of reducing heart rate while increasing stroke volume to maintain haemolymph circulation to organs associated with digestion and basal metabolism. Malnourishment for 14 days did not affect heart rate. The heart rate of larger mussels was slower than those of smaller individuals. Gender-based differences in R viridis' heart rate were not present. No diurnal (24 h) variation in cardiac activity was evident while mussels were exposed to relatively stable, immersed conditions. Heart rate plasticity often reflected the ambient environmental conditions and such a flexible physiological response may partly explain the species' dominance in transitional, polluted harbours.

Using a food web module of two consumers competing for a biotic resource, we investigate how temperature effects on species' attack and mortality rates scale up to population-level outcomes of coexistence and exclusion. We find that differences between species in their competitive effects ultimately arise from asymmetries generated by the nonlinear nature of the temperature response of mortality: cold-adapted species and thermal specialists limit themselves more strongly than they limit their warm-adapted and generalist competitors. These asymmetries become greater as seasonal temperature fluctuations increase, generating latitudinal variation in coexistence patterns and priority effects. Characterizing species' thermal niches in terms of mechanistic descriptions of trait responses to temperature allows us to make testable predictions about the population-level outcomes of competition based solely on three fundamental-and easily measurable-quantities: attack rate optima, response breadths, and temperature sensitivity of mortality. We validate our framework by testing its predictions with data from an insect host-parasitoid community. Simply by quantifying the three basic quantities, we predict that priority effects cannot occur in this system, which is borne out by population-level experiments showing that the outcome of competition does not depend on initial conditions. More broadly, our framework can predict the conditions under which exotic invasive species can exclude or coexist with native biota as well as the effects of climate warming on competitive communities across latitudinal gradients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,MAR,2018,191,3,,,,,E57,E75,,10.1086/695805,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/695805,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000427588400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is also present in offshore habitats of the Georges Bank fishing grounds. It threatens to alter fisheries habitats and shellfish aquacultures. Observations in a tide pool at Sandwich, MA from December 2003 to February 2006 show that Didemnum sp. tolerates water temperatures ranging from <= 1 to > 24 degrees C, with daily changes of up to 11 degrees C. It attaches to pebbles, cobbles, and boulders, and it overgrows other tunicates, seaweeds, sponges, and bivalves. From May to mid July, colonies appear as small patches on the bottoms of rocks. Colonies grow rapidly from July to September, with some growth into December, and they range in color from pink to pale yellow to pale orange. Colony health declines from October through April, presumably in response to changes in water temperatures, and this degenerative process is manifested by color changes, by the appearance of small dark brown spots that represent clumps of fecal pellets in the colony, by scavenging by periwinkles, and by a peeling-away of colonies from the sides of cobbles and boulders. At Sandwich, colonies died that were exposed to air at low tide. The species does not exhibit this seasonal cycle of growth and decline in subtidal habitats (40-65 m) on the Georges Bank fishing grounds where the daily climate is relatively stable and annual water temperatures range from 4 to 15 degrees C. Experiments in the tide pool with small colony fragments (5 to 9 cm(2)) show they re-attach and grow rapidly by asexual budding, increasing in size 6- to 11-fold in the first 15 days. Didemnum sp. at Sandwich has no known predators except for common periwinkles (Littorina littorea) that graze on degenerating colonies in the October to April time period and whenever colonies are stressed by desiccation. The tendencies of the ascidian (1) to attach to firm substrates, (2) to rapidly overgrow other species, (3) to tolerate a wide temperature range, (4) to be free from predation, and (5) to spread by colony fragmentation combine to make it a potential threat to benthic marine habitats and aquacultures. Didemnum sp. is known to overgrow mussels, oysters, and sea scallops, and it likely envelops other bivalves too. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents the first data on the SDA response of individual tunas of any species. Juvenile Pacific bluefin tunas (Thunnus orientalis; body mass 9.7-11.0. kg; N=7) were individually fed known quantities of food consisting primarily of squid and sardine (meal energy range 1680-8749. kJ, similar to 4-13% of tuna body mass). Oxygen consumption rates (M-O2) were measured in a swim tunnel respirometer during the postprandial period at a swimming speed of 1. body length (BL). s-1 and a water temperature of 20 degrees C. M-O2 was markedly elevated above routine levels in all fish following meal consumption [ routine metabolic rate (RMR). 174 +/- 9. mg. kg(-1)h(-1)]. The peak M-O2 during the SDA process ranged from 250 to 440. mg. kg(-1)h(-1) (1.5-2.3 times RMR) and was linearly related to meal energy content. The duration of the postprandial increment in M-O2 ranged from 21. h to 33. h depending upon meal energy content. Consequently, the total energy used in SDA increased linearly with meal energy and ranged from 170kJ to 688kJ, such that the SDA process accounted for 9.2 +/- 0.7% of ingested energy across all experiments. These values suggest rapid and efficient food conversion in T. orientalis in comparison with most other fishes. Implanted archival temperature tags recorded the increment in visceral temperature (T-V) in association with SDA. M-O2 returned to routine levels at the end of the digestive period 2-3. h earlier than T-V. The qualitative patterns in M-O2 and T-V during digestion were similar, strengthening the possibility that archival measurements of T-V can provide new insight into the energetics and habitat utilization of free-swimming bluefin in the natural environment.

Despite this, moulting rate experiments showed that stage durations of both species were invariably short with no significant regional differences. Stage durations of R. gigas CI, CII and CIII averaged 9, 28 and 15 d respectively, and those of CII, CIII and CIV C. acutus were 4, 7, and 16 d respectively.

Those for C. acutus however, were higher off shelf at the western end of the island where the copepodites were heavier than elsewhere. In addition to variations in concentration of chlorophyll a, qualitative differences in the microplankton food supply may also have influenced growth rates. Large diatoms were far more abundant off-shelf at the western end of the island compared to elsewhere, where micro-flagellates and small diatoms dominated. It is suggested that the more opportunistic feeding mode of R. gigas gave stability to its growth rate, whereas C. acutus, which is predominantly herbivorous, was affected by the fluctuations in phytoplankton concentrations and species composition.

All viable eggs increased in mass throughout incubation due to absorption of water, and mass gain during incubation was dependent on initial egg mass and incubation temperature. The average duration of incubation at 24degreesC, 27degreesC, 30degreesC, and 33degreesC was 82.1 days, 60.5 days, 51.4 days, and 50.3 days, respectively. Incubation temperature affected hatching success, energy expenditure for embryonic development, and several hatchling traits examined, but it did not affect the sex ratio of hatchlings. Hatching success was lowest (3.4%) at 33degreesC, but a higher incidence of deformed embryos was recorded from eggs incubated at this temperature compared to eggs incubated at lower temperatures. Most of the deformed embryos died at the last stage of incubation. Energy expenditure for embryonic development was, however, higher in eggs incubated at 33degreesC than those similarly incubated at lower temperatures. A prolonged exposure of eggs of C. versicolor at 33degreesC appears to have an adverse and presumably lethal effect on embryonic development. Hatching success at 24degreesC was also low (43.3%), but hatchlings incubated at 24degreesC did not differ in any of the examined traits from those incubated at two intermediate temperatures (27C and 30degreesC). Hatchlings incubated at 33degreesC were smaller (snout-vent length, SVL) than those incubated at lower incubation temperatures and had larger mass residuals (from the regression on SVL) as well as shorter head length, hindlimb length, tympanum diameter, and eye diameter relative to SVL. Hatchlings from 33degreesC had significantly lower scores on the first axis of a principal component analysis representing mainly SVL-free head size (length and width) and fore- and hindlimb lengths, but they had significantly higher scores on the second axis mainly representing SVL-free wet body mass. Variation in the level of fluctuating asymmetry in eye diameter associated with incubation temperatures was quite high, and it was clearly consistent with the prediction that environmental stress associated with the highest incubation temperatures might produce the highest level of asymmetry. Newly emerged hatchlings exhibited sexual dimorphism in head width, with male hatchlings having larger head width than females.

This included the collation and measurement of model parameters. The model was successfully validated at the location of the embryo, showing good agreement with experimental data. It was found that for the Petri dish system investigated, temperature equilibration from ambient conditions to 37 A degrees C took approximately 35 min in an incubator and that the thermal environment an embryo experiences with the lid on whilst on a heated stage is approximately 2 A degrees C warmer than with the lid off. This suggests that current practice in Assisted Reproduction may routinely expose embryos to temperatures considered detrimental to viability as a result of fluctuations caused by the addition and/or removal of the lid of the dish and the subsequent alteration of heat transfer resistance in the system.

These lemurs use tree holes with extremely varying insulation capacities as hibernacula. In poorly insulated tree holes, tree hole temperature and body temperature fluctuated strongly each day (between 12.8 and 34.4A degrees C). The metabolic rate under these conditions also showed large daily fluctuations between about 29.0 ml O(2)/h and 97.9 ml O(2)/h in parallel with changes in body temperature. In well insulated tree holes in very large trees on the other hand, tree hole temperature and body temperature remained relatively constant at about 25A degrees C. Lemurs hibernating in these tree holes showed a more constant metabolic rate at an intermediate level, but hibernation was interrupted by repeated arousals with peak metabolic rates up to 350 ml O(2)/h. The occurrence of these spontaneous arousals proved that the ability for thermoregulation persists during hibernation. Arousals were energetically costly, but much less so than in temperate and arctic hibernators. Despite the decisive influence of tree hole properties on the pattern of body temperature and metabolic rate during hibernation, the choice of the hibernaculum does not seem to be of energetic importance.

Cane toads are having a significant negative effect at the population level: at present, rainbow bee-eaters produce 0.8 fledglings per nest. However, in the absence of cane toads each nest would produce 1.2 fledglings. Rainbow bee-eaters had little defence against the cane toads. The diurnal birds were not able to mob the nocturnal toads, nor were they able to eject cane toads from the nest. Deep nests and nests built on steep slopes were still preyed upon by the toads. Cane toads that were removed from the nest had the ability and motivation to return to the nest when displaced up to 1200 m away, suggesting that the nest is a valuable resource to toads. Cane toads were significantly more likely to: (a) prey upon nests containing hatchlings rather than eggs; (b) enter and occupy artificial nest tunnels (1.2 in deep) containing a small food item (20 g of raw chicken) rather than artificial nests that were empty. These results indicate that cane toads actively prey upon nests using olfactory cues. The predatory and homing abilities of cane toads are reviewed, as well as their need for diurnal shelter sites. The possibility that cane toads are having a negative impact upon other native, ground-dwelling vertebrate fauna via their role as opportunistic predators requires urgent investigation.

This study simulated a 9-months warming scenario on the common seagrass Zostera marina from winter into summer, using outdoor mesocosms, which provided near-natural conditions. The relevance of the natural temperature pattern, as well as the 3.6 degrees C warming, and their implications were further discussed in the context of a 22-yr temperature time series of the study region. Survival of plants was high in winter independent of temperature. In spring, however, heat-treated Z. marina flowered 1.5 months earlier and experienced high mortalities. Thereafter, plant survival, growth, and pigmentation were largely comparable between temperature regimes. Yet, a comparatively high mortality occurred in ambient plants, after an abnormally warm June. Final biomass was reduced by similar to 50% in heat-treated plants. These results imply that warm winter-to-spring conditions can have severe effects on vital seagrass traits. Warming accelerates consumption of energy reserves triggering advanced flowering, similar to many terrestrial plants. Although, surviving heat-treated plants were not able to re-stock energy reserves throughout the high-light summer as inferred from low plant biomass, these seemed rather resistant to summer heatwave events.",,,,,"Pansch, Christian/I-9170-2012","Pansch, Christian/0000-0001-8442-4502; Ito, Maysa/0000-0003-1189-7338",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,DEC,2021,66,12,,,,,4112,4124,,10.1002/lno.11947,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11947,,OCT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000708902600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Water and zooplankton used in laboratory experiments were collected from the Pampulha reservoir. The experimental units were incubated in the light (1500 Lux) and in the dark at 25.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C during different periods of the diel cycle. At the end of each experiment, the following variables were measured: temperature, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and orthophosphate as well as the composition, abundance and dry weight of the zooplankton. The specific respiration and excretion rates were determined considering the differences in concentration between experimental and control units. The effect of diurnal cycle on respiration rates was clearly more intense than the effect of light. The average values of respiration rates obtained in the morning hours oscillated between 0.015 and 0.016 mgO(2)mgDW . hr(-1) (light and dark incubations). At night, these rates were higher and ranged from 0.020 to 0.035 mgO(2)mgDW . hr(-1). Increased biomass of zooplankton and longer incubation times produced lower respiration rates. The excretion rates of ammonia were higher at night, reaching a mean value of 4.2 mu gN-NH4/mg DW . hr(-1) in illuminated units. The phosphate excretion rates were more elevated in the morning, reaching 0.58 mu gP-PO4/mg/DW . hr(-1) illuminated vessels. The nanoplankton was able to actively absorb ammonia as well as phosphate. The highest ammonia absorption rates were measured at night, whereas the nanoplankton absorbed phosphorus only in the morning hours. The nutritional status of zooplankton also showed short-term variations. The mean phosphorus content of zooplankton biomass also varied between day and night as well as with incubation time. It ranged from 0.58-2.17%, whereas organic matter variation was more conservative, oscillating around 70-92% in all occasions. J. Exp. Zool. 286:671-682, 2000.

Field experiments were conducted at two Arkansas locations to determine the effect of drill-seeded soybean density on Palmer amaranth emergence. Experimental factors were multiple soybean seeding rates planted on a 19-cm-wide row spacing and the presence or absence of a PRE residual herbicide (flumioxazin plus pyroxasulfone). Soybean groundcover was measured throughout the growing season and daily soil temperature was recorded in selected soybean densities. In the absence of a PRE residual herbicide, at least a 1.7-fold reduction in Palmer amaranth emergence occurred when soybean were present. Differences in Palmer amaranth emergence occurred among soybean densities for both locations, suggesting the value of crop canopy in preventing Palmer amaranth emergence in the absence of an effective residual herbicide. In plots treated with the PRE herbicide, no difference in Palmer amaranth emergence occurred among soybean densities, except for the absence of soybean. Achievement of 95% groundcover by soybean reduced daily soil temperature fluctuations, which in turn reduced Palmer amaranth emergence. For both locations, soybean grain yields were greatest at the highest seeding rate (617,500 seed ha(-1)). In the presence of flumioxazin plus pyroxasulfone applied PRE, greater grain yields occurred compared to the absence of a PRE herbicide at both Fayetteville and Marianna. Based on this research, an effective PRE-applied residual herbicide has more influence on Palmer amaranth emergence than soybean density, and Palmer amaranth germination and emergence are dependent upon daily soil temperature fluctuations, which is a function of soybean density.",,,,,"Norsworthy, Jason/GXZ-5733-2022","Norsworthy, Jason/0000-0002-7379-6201",,,,,,,,,,,,,0890-037X,1550-2740,,,,OCT-DEC,2015,29,4,,,,,697,706,,10.1614/WT-D-14-00158.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WT-D-14-00158.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000365866100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the accuracy of paleoclimate reconstructions from glacial geology is limited by the challenge of representing mountain meteorology in numerical models. Precipitation is usually treated in a simple manner and yet represents difficult-to-characterize variables such as amount, distribution, and phase. Furthermore, precipitation distributions during a glacial probably differed from present-day interglacial patterns. We applied two models to investigate glacier sensitivity to temperature and precipitation in the eastern Southern Alps of New Zealand. A 2-D model was used to quantify variations in the length of the reconstructed glaciers resulting from plausible precipitation distributions compared to variations in length resulting from change in mean annual air temperature and precipitation amount. A 1-D model was used to quantify variations in length resulting from interannual climate variability. Assuming that present-day interglacial values represent precipitation distributions during the last glacial, a range of plausible present-day precipitation distributions resulted in uncertainty in the Last Glacial Maximum length of the Pukaki Glacier of 17.1km (24%) and the Rakaia Glacier of 9.3km (25%), corresponding to a 0.5 degrees C difference in temperature. Smaller changes in glacier length resulted from a 50% decrease in precipitation amount from present-day values (-14% and -18%) and from a 50% increase in precipitation amount (5% and 9%).

Heatwaves may affect macroinvertebrates' bioturbating behavior in intertidal areas, thereby altering the deposition-erosion balance at tidal flats. Moreover, small-scale topographic features on tidal flats can create tidal pools during the low tide, thus changing the heat capacity of tidal flats. These pools could then potentially operate as refuge environments during marine heatwaves. We studied behavior responses to heat waves using the well-known bioturbating cockle Cerastoderma edule as a model species. Different temperature regimes (i.e., fluctuating between 20 and 40 degrees C) and micro-topographies (i.e., presence vs. absence of tidal water pools) were mimicked in a mesocosm experiment with regular tidal regimes. Our results demonstrate that behavioral responses to heat stress strongly depend on the site-specific morphological features. Cockles covered by shallow water pools moved up when exposed to thermal stress, while burrowing deeper into the sediment in the absence of water pools. But in both cases, their migratory behavior increased under heat stress compared to regular ambient treatments. Moreover, long-term cumulative heat stress increased cockles' respiration rates and decreased their health conditions, causing mass mortality after four weeks of gradually increasing heat exposure.

This approach provides daily subsurface oceanic environmental information according to fishery dates and locations.

The results of seawater temperature and salinity represented differences of less than +/- 0.5 degrees C and +/- 0.05, respectively, according to verification of error analysis and truth-finding comparisons. After applying the constructed temperature and salinity profiles, we described the relationship between subsurface information and yellowfin tuna catch distribution. Statistical analysis revealed that yellowfin tuna were more adapted to warmer and saltier seawater. At the near-surface (<5 m), the most suitable temperature was 28-29 degrees C, although yellowfin tuna can endure a temperature range from 11 to 12 degrees C at a depth of 300 m. The corresponding upper boundary of the thermocline was approximately 75 m, with a mean strength of 0.074 degrees C/m, and the most suitable salinity for yellowfin tuna was 34.5-36.0 at depths shallower than 300 m.

Increasing the dietary grain content can enhance the post-absorptive carbohydrate status, but providing excessive fermentable starch can cause rumen disorders and this is especially true during HS. Current study objectives were to evaluate the effects of a glycerol based supplemental product on growth and metabolic variables in Holstein bull calves during controlled HS. Before the start of the experiment, bull calves (n=14; 163.6 +/- 30.1 kg body weight) were subjected to thermal neutral conditions [26.5 +/- 3.4 degrees C and a temperature-humidity index (THI) of 70.4 +/- 2.8] for 7 d (period 1; P1). During this period, productive parameters as well as blood metabolites were measured and used as covariates for the subsequent HS period. Following P1, a cyclical HS pattern was implemented for 21 d (P2) where daily ambient temperatures ranged from 29.1 to 39.7 degrees C and the THI was > 74 for 24 h/d and > 83 for at least 14 h/d. During P2, half of the HS calves (n=7) received a control diet (CON) and the other half received the control diet supplemented with a product (300 g/d) containing gluconeogenic precursors (GLU). Throughout each period respiration rate, rectal temperature and skin temperature at the shoulder and rump were recorded at 0600, 1100 and 1500 h daily. Blood samples were obtained prior to and 4 h post the a.m. feeding during both periods. Although HS markedly reduced DMI (18%) and growth as expected, supplemental GLU did not affect body weight gain. Supplemental GLU decreased the shoulder temperature at 0600 and 1500 h (P < 0.01), and decreased respiratory rate at 1500 h (P < 0.02). Feeding GLU did not affect blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose or nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations, but increased circulating insulin prior to the a.m. feeding (P < 0.03) and this demonstrates that GLU was effective at enhancing the post-absorptive carbohydrate status.

To provide the ocean surface forcing at the mesoscale, output fields of three meteorological models (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and Meteo-France ARPEGE and ALADIN) were gathered as well as satellite data. To evaluate the consistency of model fields, we compare ship measurements to the predicted radiative and turbulent surface fluxes and to turbulent fluxes derived from analyses using a bulk formula. We first analyze the quality of the ship bulk fluxes in terms of possible effects of the flow distortion and of intrinsic variability as function of the integration time. The airflow distortion over the ship is found to significantly affect fluxes, but the mean fluxes over the experiment remain unchanged because of compensation between positive and negative errors due to the varying apparent wind direction. Spectral analysis of the ship time series as well as comparison of fluxes obtained by using several averaging times from 1 to 90 min show that the optimal scale for computing ship fluxes is about 20 min, ensuring consistency with the derivation of bulk drag and exchange coefficient. These fluxes are then taken as reference for the comparison with models and satellites. None of the predicted radiative fluxes is consistent with ship measurements. Model turbulent fluxes differ from each other, and the main reason is the discrepancy between modeled and observed atmospheric features. Large discrepancies are found between predicted fluxes and ship fluxes in strong wind conditions due to the different flux parameterization for heat fluxes. Model bulk fluxes thus compare better to ship than predicted fluxes, particularly during the middle period of the experiment. On the contrary, the Meteosat-derived downward radiative fluxes are comparable to the ship data, and their high time sampling allows us to describe the diurnal cycle of the solar heating. They can be used either at an instantaneous scale (comparison of the satellite flux averaged over 0.1degrees x 0.1degrees with 10 min averaged ship fluxes) or at a larger scale (0.3degrees x 0.3degrees,1 hour).

Our data made evident that the interplay between photoperiod and temperature has a direct effect on growth parameter responses of H. armigera. However, the type of temperature regime (fluctuating or alternating) may enhance or diminish the effects of photoperiod. With fluctuating temperature, larval developmental time was significantly reduced with increasing photophase, irrespective of the diapause status later in the pupal stage; the lowest value was observed under continuous light conditions. With alternating temperature, larval developmental time was significantly decreased with the reduction in temperature amplitude, and with the coincidence of the thermophase with the scotophase. At both temperature regimes, no significant differences in pupal weight were observed between diapausing and non-diapausing individuals, although, in most treatments, the diapausing pupae tended to be heavier than the non-diapausing ones. The increased pupal weight of individuals destined for diapause is probably related to their longer larval developmental time. Knowing the effects of these factors on the variation of H. armigera growth is necessary in explaining phenomena associated with immature stages, and can lead to a more profound understanding of the potential for this insect to evolve in response to environmental changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,1570-7458,,,,JAN,2012,142,1,,,,,60,70,,10.1111/j.1570-7458.2011.01201.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2011.01201.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000297794100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mango fruits [Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae)] were co-infested with larvae at different constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and relative humidity of 50 +/- 8%, using different infestation sequences at each temperature (BC together; BC/CB 1, 2, and 3 days apart). There were significant effects of competition in most experimental treatments, resulting in reduced larval survival, pupal mass, and adult emergence for both species. At most of the infestation/temperature combinations, C. cosyra was clearly the inferior competitor. The only exception was at 20 degrees C when the outcome depended on the sequence of infestation: no C. cosyra survived when the sequence was BC, but more C. cosyra than B. invadens survived when it was CB. At 15 degrees C, all C. cosyra larvae died, while the development of B. invadens was prolonged and adult emergence reduced. We conclude that resource pre-emption and fluctuations in temperature in mango agroecosystems help to explain observed shifts in dominance between B. invadens and C. cosyra on mango in many parts of Africa. The small window of competitive superiority for C. cosyra at 20 degrees C and CB infestation sequence, together with other factors such as fecundity and alternative hosts, may allow for co-existence in some environments.",,,,,"Ekesi, Sunday/P-8944-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,1570-7458,,,,OCT,2009,133,1,,,,,27,37,,10.1111/j.1570-7458.2009.00897.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2009.00897.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000269701100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, we compare pre-industrial control simulations with (CHEM) and without (NOCHEM) interactive chemistry. In general, the influence of the chemistry on the mean state and the variability is small and mainly restricted to the stratosphere and mesosphere. The atmospheric dynamics mainly differ in polar regions, with slightly stronger polar vortices in the austral and boreal winter, respectively. The strengthening of the vortex is related to larger stratospheric temperature gradients, which are attributed to a parameterisation of the absorption of ozone and oxygen in different wavelength intervals, which is considered in the version with interactive chemistry only. A second reason for the temperature differences between CHEM and NOCHEM is related to diurnal variations in the ozone concentrations in the higher atmosphere, which are missing in NOCHEM. Furthermore, stratospheric water vapour concentrations substantially differ between the two experiments, but their effect on temperature is small. In both setups, the simulated intensity and variability of the northern polar vortex is inside the range of present-day observations. Additionally, the performance of SOCOL-MPIOM under changing external forcings is assessed for the period 1600-2000 using an ensemble of simulations. In the industrial period from 1850 onward SOCOL-MPIOM overestimates the global mean surface air temperature increase in comparison to observational data sets.

A.",,,The influence of multiple environmental stressors on the limpet Cellana toreuma during the summer monsoon season in Hong Kong,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although environmental stressors affect natural systems in a multitude of ways, the interactive effect of multiple stressors on ecological assemblages remains largely misunderstudied. On tropical shores which experience seasonal monsoons, rocky intertidal habitats are physiologically stressful environments, being strongly affected by high temperatures and monsoon rains during emersion. In Hong Kong the limpet, Cellana toreuma, often takes refuge in mid-shore tidepools. In summer, these populations experience high mortality, probably as a result of stressful environmental conditions during low-spring tide days with high temperatures and/or intense rainfall periods can occur. Laboratory experiments were designed to mimic the effects of temperature stress (and increasing pool salinity) and reduced salinity as a result of monsoon rains on C. toreuma in tidepools. In general, haemolymph osmolality increased with salinity and limpet mortality increased with temperature. As salinity decreased after simulated rainfall, haemolymph osmolality (after 60 min) and survival (after 180 min) were significantly lower than in control treatments. Salinity fluctuations, coupled with high temperatures during emersion had both sub-lethal physiological effects and lethal effects on limpets in tidepools. Conducting experiments of multiple stressors simultaneously, however, revealed no interaction between hot temperatures and salinity variation, both of which operated independently for different response variables. Individually, therefore, hot temperatures and large salinity changes associated with the wet monsoon season are likely to play an important role in the population dynamics of intertidal species such as C. toreuma, and as a result will influence the structure and functioning of tropical rocky shores.

Significant cross-correlations were found between phytoplankton abundances and the maximum daily tidal range (peak concentrations occurred between the neap and spring tides) and SST (peak concentrations occurred during periods of warmer SST).

Transverse stylet sections were embedded in thermo-plastic cement and ground until a thin section was achieved. A pre-hatch region and first post-hatch increment was identified in the stylet microstructure. The number of increments, across all ages and temperature treatments, was in remarkably close agreement to age (number of days), clearly demonstrating that stylet increments are deposited daily throughout the lifiecycle of O. pallidus. Morphometric analyses of the stylet indicated that increments were laid down regularly during stylet growth and that stylets grew in concert with body size, further supporting daily periodicity.

However, whether the interaction between elevated CO2 and diel CO2 cycles is further modified by elevated temperature is unknown. To test this, we reared juvenile spiny damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, for 11 weeks in two stable (450 and 1000 mu atm) and two diel- cycling elevated CO(2 )treatments (1000 +/- 300 and 1000 +/- 500 mu atm) at both current-day (29 degrees C) and projected future temperature (31 degrees C). We measured the effects on survivorship, growth, behavioral lateralization, activity, boldness and escape performance (fast starts). A significant interaction between CO2 and temperature was only detected for survivorship. Survival was lower in the two cycling CO2 treatments at 31 degrees C compared with 29 degrees C but did not differ between temperatures in the two stable CO2 treatments. In other traits we observed independent effects of elevated CO2, and interactions between elevated CO2 and diel CO2 cycles, but these effects were not influenced by temperature. There was a trend toward decreased growth in fish reared under stable elevated CO2 that was counteracted by diel CO2 cycles, with fish reared under cycling CO2 being significantly larger than fish reared under stable elevated CO2. Diel CO2 cycles also mediated the negative effect of elevated CO2 on behavioral lateralization, as previously reported. Routine activity was reduced in the 1000 +/- 500 mu atm CO2 treatment compared to control fish. In contrast, neither boldness nor fast-starts were affected by any of the CO2 treatments. Elevated temperature had significant independent effects on growth, routine activity and fast start performance. Our results demonstrate that diel CO2 cycles can significantly modify the growth and behavioral responses of fish under elevated CO2 and that these effects are not altered by elevated temperature, at least in this species. Our findings add to a growing body of work that highlights the critical importance of incorporating natural CO2 variability in ocean acidification experiments to more accurately assess the effects of ocean climate change on marine ecosystems.",,,,,"Jarrold, Michael D./AAC-4534-2019; Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011","Jarrold, Michael D./0000-0003-4224-9683; Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,DEC 12,2018,5,,,,,,,,458,10.3389/fmars.2018.00458,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00458,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000457216100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Development rates of eggs and larvae increased linearly with temperature up to 35-degrees-C (r2 greater-than-or-equal-to 0.95). More than 91% of the variation in development rate of first and second instars was explained by temperature, whereas temperature explained only 42% of the variation in third-instar development rate. A part of the variation in development rate of third instars may be explained by the fact that the designated end point of this stadium (emergence of third instars from leaves) occurred only during the photophase. Overall, 99.9% of larvae emerged from leaves after 95 degree-days (DD) (threshold temperature, 10-degrees-C).

Pair-wise interactions of a community of basidiomycetes were made under 3 different microclimate conditions that mimic fluctuations in local climate conditions, and the outcome of interactions was assessed in terms of: (1) which fungus won the confrontation or whether it was a draw (deadlock); (2) the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and enzyme activities; and (3) the rate of decomposition. While substrate utilisation and exploitation in terms of decomposition was not affected, community response to changing temperature was underpinned by altered outcomes of interactions and changes to territory occupation, which were reflected by changes in VOC production and extracellular enzyme activity.

For both temperature transfers, light-saturated stomatal conductance (g(s) (sat)) and photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A(sat)) were highly correlated with each other and with midday RWC, suggesting that A was limited by water stress-mediated stomatal closure, However, prolonged growth at A-RZT reduced light- and CO2-saturated photosynthetic O-2 evolution (P-max), indicating non-stomatal limitation of photosynthesis.

Invasion success of these exotic grasses is driven in part by germination responses to climate fluctuations. Understanding how climate influences germination characteristics of invasive grasses is critical to predicting desert wildfire. While the germination characteristics of cheatgrass have been reported, the germination requirements for red brome, the exotic grass associated with fire in the Mojave Desert, have not. Herein we characterize germination response of red brome through hydrothermal-time modeling. The hydrothermal-time requirements were matched with historic climate data to estimate optimal germination periods for red brome and its potential association with wildfire. The optimal temperature for germination in a population of red brome seeds was 19.3 A degrees C with a hydrothermal-time constant of 38.9 MPa A degrees C days and a mean base water potential of -1.35 MPa. Based on the hydrothermal model, high red brome germination rates are most likely to occur in wet Octobers when optimal fall temperatures overlap with adequate moisture.

Several copepod species, especially estuarine dwelling species, have demonstrated high phenotypic plasticity and adaptability to variations in environmental conditions. Copepods play a critical role in aquatic foodwebs and their population structure is closely linked to water quality fluctuations, especially salinity and temperature. However, few studies have examined the response of population structure to environmental stress. Here, we examine the population structure, egg production and hatching success of Acartia fancetti in relation to hypersalinity (30, 40, 50 and 60) and temperature (15 degrees C and 20 degrees C). A. fancetti is a neritic species occupying a key niche in the hypersaline areas of the Coorong, South Australia. Our results show a significant influence of salinity and temperature on the population size, nauplii production, copepodites production and adults of A. fancetti. The maximum numbers of nauplii, copepodites and adults were at salinity 30 and 40, at both 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. However, substantial population sizes were also observed at salinity 50 and 60 in 15 degrees C treatments. At 20 degrees C, no individual was observed at salinity 60. This study indicates that the population of A. fancetti in the Coorong is tolerant to hypersalinity at lower temperatures, but the combined effects of haline and thermal stress significantly reduces the ability of this species to survive at higher temperatures. The distribution of A. fancetti in the Coorong is also affected by the environmental change related to anthropogenic activities.",,,,,"Hemraj, Ashley Deevesh/K-1420-2019; Leterme, Sophie C./A-5013-2013","Hemraj, Ashley Deevesh/0000-0003-1761-6023; Leterme, Sophie C./0000-0001-8455-7049; Qin, Jianguang/0000-0003-2448-8058",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,JAN,2018,498,,,,,,8,15,,10.1016/j.jembe.2017.10.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2017.10.004,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000418628800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Extensive changes in marine communities in southwest Britain and the western English Channel have been recorded during the past 70 years. 2. Over the same period there was a climatic warming from the early 1920s, then a cooling to the early 1980s, with recent resumption of warming; the change in annual mean temperature was approximately +/-0.5 degrees C. 3. Marked changes occurred in plankton community structure; the distribution of both plankton and intertidal organisms was affected, with latitudinal shifts of up to 120 miles; there were increases or decreases of 2-3 orders of magnitude in abundance. 4. Warm water species increased in abundance and extended their range during periods of warming, while cold-water species declined or retreated; the reverse occurred during the period of cooling. 5. Climate change can influence marine communities by a combination of: direct effect on the organisms; effects mediated by biotic interactions; and indirectly through ocean currents. 6. From climate models that indicate rises of mean temperature of 2 degrees C in the next 50 years, and from the observed changes, we can expect future latitudinal shifts of 200-400 miles in distribution of plankton, fish and benthos, with extensive restructuring of planktonic, pelagic and benthic communities. 7. Species common now in the Bay of Biscay will become common in the English Channel; those presently restricted to the western English Channel could colonise the central Irish Sea; changes in community structure could lead to lower abundances of infaunal benthos and fish. 8.

Population growth is dependent on offspring survival. Initial survival of sea turtle offspring is subject to the incubation environment, where higher incubation temperatures negatively affect their vigour and morphology. Thus, at some rookeries with drastic fluctuations in sand temperature, hatchling characteristics have been demonstrated to exhibit seasonal and annual variation. We examined whether body size and emergence success of loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) hatchlings decline seasonally at a temperate rookery (Yakushima Island, Japan) in correlation with the seasonal rise in air temperature. Clutches collected during two survey periods within the same nesting season were incubated on the same beach hatchery over two years. The body size of adult females that laid experimental clutches was not significantly different between the survey periods. Corresponding to seasonally rising air temperatures, incubation duration for clutches of the first survey period was significantly longer than that of the second. However, both hatchling size and emergence success did not decrease seasonally, and there were no significant negative correlations between the mean air temperature or the estimated mean sand temperature during incubation and the hatchling characteristics. These may be due to a combination of coarse white sand and high rainfall on the experimental beach, which might have lowered sand and nest temperatures and elevated sand moisture.

To investigate this problem, an experiment was conducted on Mywybilla clay where sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench cv. 'Goldrush II') and sunflower ( Helianthus annuus L. cv. 'Hysun 33') were sown on 25 September and 5 November 1986, and on 12 February and 30 April 1987, at 3, 7 and 12 cm depths, with and without a presswheel. Different levels of post-sowing irrigation were applied. After sowing, soil physical properties (water content, bulk density, penetration resistance, aggregate size, temperature) of the seedbeds were monitored. Relationships between soil properties and attributes of crop establishment (establishment percentage, rate of emergence and seedling yield) were examined. Shallow sowing increased the diurnal range in seedbed temperature and increased the mean temperature experienced by the seed. Soil temperatures were reduced by increased soil water content. Mean soil temperature was correlated with mean air temperature and soil water content. Bulk density was increased by presswheels, but not consistently, and decreased with increasing soil water-and with depth. Penetration resistance was low in all seedbeds, with values highest in dry soil after deep sowing in the first seedbed. The proportion of small aggregates (less than 5.6 mm) after soil drying was highest when seedbed water content was less than about 0.22 g g-1, or - 15.0 bar water potential. Levels of establishment, time to median emergence, and seedling weight of both species increased with increasing post-sowing soil moisture content. Time to median emergence was delayed and seedling weight was decreased with increasing depth of sowing. Establishment was linearly correlated with rate of emergence in suboptimum conditions. As soil moisture decreased, establishment was better at higher soil temperatures. For 80% establishment, soil water content varied from 0.25-0.30 g g-1 in cooler early season seedbeds, to 0.20-0.25 g g-1 in warm late sown seedbeds. Without moisture stress, rate of emergence increased with soil temperature but establishment peaked between average maximum soil temperatures at seed level of 24-32-degrees-C. The peak temperature increased as sowing depth became more shallow. Establishment and rate of emergence were only fairly described (R2 = 0.65 and R2 > 0.50, respectively) by considering soil temperature, moisture content and depth of sowing in simple linear multiple regression models. Seedling weight usually increased in conditions suited to rapid emergence and high establishment. The exception was in a dry seedbed when moisture was available below seedbed depth. Then, deeper sown seeds produced fewer but heavier seedlings. Any benefits of presswheels to establishment were associated with intermediate soil moisture content and shallow sowing. The practical implications of the results are considered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0167-1987,1879-3444,,,,FEB,1992,23,1-2,,,,,1,25,,10.1016/0167-1987(92)90002-S,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-1987(92)90002-S,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992HH42000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Strong positive relationships were identified between 1) bacterial production and bacterial abundance and 2) bacterial production and algal biomass.

The analysis of covariance model revealed consistent differences between fresh, marine and estuarine/coastal waters, with production consistently high in estuarine/coastal environments. The log-linear regression coefficient of abundance was not significantly different from 1.00, and this linear relationship permitted the use of specific growth rate (SGR in day-1) as a dependent variable. A strong relationship was identified between specific growth rate and temperature. This relationship differed slightly across the three habitats. A substantial portion of the residual variation from this relationship was accounted for by algal biomass, including the difference between marine and estuarine/coastal habitats. A small but significant difference between the fresh- and saltwater habitats remained. No significant difference between the chlorophyll effect in different habitats was identified. The model of SGR against temperature and chlorophyll was much weaker for freshwater than for marine environments.

J,"Munro, D; Thomas, DW",,,,"Munro, D; Thomas, DW",,,The role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the expression of torpor by mammals: a review,ZOOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Heterothermic mammals increase the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in their body fats prior to entering torpor. Because PUFA have low melting points, it is thought that they play an important role in maintaining the fluidity of depot fats and membrane phospholipids at low body temperatures. However, PUFA are more prone to autoxidation when exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) during torpor and during the periodic arousals that characterize hibernation. A lack of PUFA or an excess of PUFA may constrain the use of torpor by heterothermic mammals. We performed a mixed model meta-analysis of 17 controlled-feeding studies to test the effect of dietary PUFA on the depth and expression of torpor by daily heterotherms and hibernators. We also reviewed the literature on the PUFA content of the diet and depot fats of heterothermic mammals to address two principal topics: (1) Do low dietary levels of PUFA reduce the expression of torpor under laboratory conditions and, if so, are free-ranging animals constrained by a lack of PUFA? (2) Do high dietary levels of PUFA result in a reduction in the use, depth, and duration of torpor and, if so, do free-ranging animals seek to optimize rather than maximize PUFA intake? Low-PUFA diets consistently increase the lower setpoint for body temperature and minimum metabolic rate for both hibernators and daily heterotherms. Above the lower setpoint, low-PUFA diets usually increase body temperature and metabolic rate and decrease the duration of torpor bouts and this effect is similar for hibernators and daily heterotherms. Free-ranging rodent hibernators have dietary PUFA intakes that are far higher than those of the low-PUFA diets offered in controlled-feeding experiments, so these hibernators may never experience the constraints associated with a lack of PUFA. Diets of free-ranging insectivorous bats and echidnas have PUFA levels that are less than half as high as those offered in experimental low-PUFA diets, yet they exhibit deep and extended bouts of torpor. We argue that alternate mechanisms exist for maintaining the fluidity of body fats and that high-PUFA intake may not be a prerequisite for deep and extended bouts of torpor. Four studies indicate that animals that were fed high-PUFA diets are reluctant to enter torpor and show shallower and shorter torpor bouts. Although authors attribute this response to autoxidation, these animals did not have a higher PUFA content in their depot fats than animals where PUFA was shown to enhance torpor. We suggest that these contradictory results indicate inter-specific or inter-individual variation in the ability to control ROS and limit autoxidation of PUFA. High dietary levels of PUFA will constrain the expression of torpor only when the oxidative challenge exceeds the capacity of the antioxidant defence system. Studies of diet selection indicate that insectivorous species with low dietary PUFA levels seek to maximize PUFA intake. However, herbivorous species that have access to plants and plant parts of high-PUFA content do not appear to maximize PUFA intake. These data suggest that animals attempt to optimize rather than maximize PUFA intake.",,,,,"Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0944-2006,,,,,,2004,107,1,,,,,29,48,,10.1016/j.zool.2003.12.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2003.12.001,,,,,,,,16351926,,,,,WOS:000221082000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Tree canopies, however, can significantly buffer temperature fluctuations, giving rise to lower maximum temperatures, higher minimum temperatures and enhanced water availability at the forest floor. Forests, therefore, can act as refugia for heat-sensitive species with important implications for climate-change responses in the understorey of forests. These forest microclimate offsets have been well-studied, but far less is known about how microclimate offsets are modulated by tree species mixing. We installed temperature and air humidity loggers in a multisite tree diversity experiment to quantify the role of tree species richness and composition on below-canopy offsets and investigate mechanisms underlying these effects. Microclimate offsets highly depended on tree species identity and mixing. Not only monocultures of larch Larix x eurolepis and Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii had a high performance for thermal buffering, but also mixtures with species such as birch Betula pendula and pine Pinus sylvestris. Indirect effects brought about by tree species mixing were found to amplify microclimate offsets, mostly via increased canopy cover. Synthesis and applications. Our findings show that microclimate offsetting highly depends on tree species identity and diversity, and that buffered forest microclimates can be achieved rapidly in young plantations, depending on the species being planted. Based on our findings, we recommend planting mixtures instead of monocultures. Not only because species mixing was found to amplify microclimate offsets in some of the investigated stands, but also because tree species mixing is likely to increase the resilience of forests to climate change. Hence, we expect that also on the long-term species mixing might be beneficial for microclimate buffering.

We present growing season soil chamber methane emission (F-CH4), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary production (GPP) fluxes from a 9-years water table manipulation experiment in an Alaskan rich fen. The study included major flood and drought years, where wetting and drying treatments further modified the severity of droughts. Results support previous findings from peatlands that drought causes reduced magnitude of growing season F-CH4, GPP and NEE, thus reducing or reversing their C sink function. Experimentally exacerbated droughts further reduced the capacity for the fen to act as a C sink by causing shifts in vegetation and thus reducing magnitude of maximum growing season GPP in subsequent flood years by similar to 15% compared to control plots. Conversely, water table position had only a weak influence on ER, but dominant contribution to ER switched from autotrophic respiration in wet years to heterotrophic in dry years. Droughts did not cause interannual lag effects on ER in this rich fen, as has been observed in several nutrient-poor peatlands. While ER was dependent on soil temperatures at 2 cm depth, F-CH4 was linked to soil temperatures at 25 cm. Inter-annual variability of deep soil temperatures was in turn dependent on wetness rather than air temperature, and higher F-CH4 in flooded years was thus equally due to increased methane production at depth and decreased methane oxidation near the surface. Short-term fluctuations in wetness caused significant lag effects on F-CH4, but droughts caused no inter-annual lag effects on F-CH4.

However, wetlands also contribute to global warming, most obviously through microbial methane production. Driving the biochemical processes that enable methanogenesis is a diverse community of microorganisms under the influence of multiple environmental factors that are poorly constrained in greenhouse gas flux models. Sediments were collected from several distinct microsites across a fresh-water, constructed temperate wetland in Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A. Depth and temperature were tested for their influence on methane emission rates under two controlled temperatures. Pyrosequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate microbial communities associated with microsites and depths. Unvegetated, open-water and vegetated microsite sediments had similar potential methane flux rates when cores were separated into shallow and deeper depths. Deeper sediments lacked the ability to produce detectable methane without substrate addition. A 10 degrees C increase in temperature accelerated the rate of methane production and carbon dioxide respiration by 2-3 fold across all microsites. Methanogens were initially most prevalent in sediments collected from open-water microsite sediments, although had little effect on potential methane flux rates during incubations. These results suggest that upper limit methane emissions are similar across microsites in the absence of other field scale effects, such as redox boundaries, vegetation, or hydrologic fluctuations.

This case study was conducted at the University of Wyoming in 2007 to demonstrate viability of integrated GIS and SDSS methods as useful ex-ante assessment technologies to help rank relative suitability of Wyoming agricultural land for optimum establishment of Laramie Tifton burclover [Medicago rigidula (L.) Allioni] in the Central High Plains agricultural region. The study uses fuzzy set logic methods and implements the fuzzy simple additive weighting (FSAW) method through modeling in GIS raster to analyze Wyoming State's agricultural land use, and the identified suitability attributes for optimum burclover establishment; the long-term summer diurnal temperature flux, September-October precipitation, and April-July precipitation. Further, the study uses one of the two categories of multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) known as multiple attribute decision making (MADM), to combine the range of each attribute's possible suitability values in meaningful ways that allow suitability criteria to be evaluated on the basis of low, medium, and high suitability for optimum burclover establishment. The inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation technique interpolated the point shape files of the identified suitability attributes and produced surface maps that allowed characterization of long-term summer diurnal temperature flux and seasonal precipitation for the State of Wyoming. The fuzzy additive weighting and defuzzification methods transformed data from different sources into useful information that can be effectively used to enhance decision making in agriculture. Finally, defuzzification transformed fuzzy scores into useful crisp scores and produced the final output map with calculated centroid. The resulting calculated trapezoidal centroid map with useful crisp scores from transformed disparate fuzzy data demonstrates that spatial suitability analysis can be used effectively to enhance decision making in agricultural planning and management. Likewise, the effective ranking of relative suitability of Wyoming agricultural land for optimum establishment of Laramie Tifton burclover validates the value of using fuzzy set logic and additive weighting approaches for ex-ante assessment of the potential suitability of agricultural technologies.

Understanding how changing winter climates influence the seasonal timing of key life events is critical for implementing effective conservation strategies, especially for poikilotherms, whose physiology and development are particularly sensitive to changes in thermal environment. Four mathematical models are available to predict the timing of hatch and emergence in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar); however, such models are only useful if the effect of temperature is both repeatable within and among maternal families, and predictable across variable temperature regimes. Using a split-brood experiment, we found the timing of hatch to be repeatable and predictable in Atlantic salmon from the Exploits River, one of the largest remaining wild populations in North America. Three of the available mathematical models under-estimated the timing of hatch by an average of 21-26 accumulated thermal units (ATU); however, we identified one model that provided reasonable estimates of hatch timing (average under-estimate 7 ATU) under the three incubation temperature regimes we tested. We applied this model to daily water temperature profiles from 2006-18 at four sites within the Exploits River watershed. Across all years and sites, the predicted dates at 50% hatch ranged between 8 March and 23 May, while predicted dates of 50% emergence ranged from 11 May to 13 June. By identifying the seasonal timing of these particularly vulnerable early life stages, this model can aid the implementation of conservation efforts for this ecologically and economically important population.",,,,,"Rooke, Anna/AAN-8486-2020","Rooke, Anna/0000-0001-7258-9094",,,,,,,,,,,,,2051-1434,,,,,MAY 15,2019,7,,,,,,,,coz015,10.1093/conphys/coz015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coz015,,,,,,,,31110765,,,,,WOS:000484492100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The duration of ascospore release was longer in England, where winter weather is mild and wet, than in Poland, where winters are cold and often with snow cover, but there was little difference between two sites in England (Rothamsted and Boxworth).

We tested for variability in the thermal dependence of crawling speed population growth rate, and mating compatibility among four strains of the ciliate Euplotes vannus (LL1, Elba, Por7, and Sard6). In addition, we tested for differences in thermal acclimation of crawling speed among the four strains after more than 2 wk of chronic exposure to constant temperatures. The thermal dependence of crawling speed and population growth rate differed significantly among the four strains as determined by ANOVA. Strains also differed significantly in locomotory acclimation to chronic, constant temperature treatments, as indicated by a significant interaction among the effects of strain, acclimation temperature, and test (experimental) temperature. One strain (LL1) showed evidence of positive thermal compensation, whereas other strains showed mixed or no acclimatory responses. The frequency of conjugation between strains of E. vannus was also temperature-dependent. This finding in particular has important implications for Euplotes systematics; genetic exchange may occur between some strains that were previously thought to be reproductively isolated. Differences in functional traits among these clonal strains represent genotypic variability that may broaden the range of thermal environments available to E. vannus and may, in conjunction with differential mating, accelerate the evolutionary response to selection. Such variability may be particularly advantageous for E. vannus, an organism common to shallow marine environments(e.g., tidal pools) that undergo substantial daily and seasonal changes in temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-935X,,,,,JAN-FEB,1995,68,1,,,,,98,113,,10.1086/physzool.68.1.30163920,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/physzool.68.1.30163920,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QK31900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

A.; Dahlgren, David K.; Orange, Jeremy P.",,,Extreme climatic events constrain space use and survival of a ground-nesting bird,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two fundamental issues in ecology are understanding what influences the distribution and abundance of organisms through space and time. While it is well established that broad-scale patterns of abiotic and biotic conditions affect organisms' distributions and population fluctuations, discrete events may be important drivers of space use, survival, and persistence. These discrete extreme climatic events can constrain populations and space use at fine scales beyond that which is typically measured in ecological studies. Recently, a growing body of literature has identified thermal stress as a potential mechanism in determining space use and survival. We sought to determine how ambient temperature at fine temporal scales affected survival and space use for a ground-nesting quail species (Colinus virginianus; northern bobwhite). We modeled space use across an ambient temperature gradient (ranging from similar to 20 to 38 degrees C) through a MAXENT algorithm. We also used Andersen-Gill proportional hazard models to assess the influence of ambient temperature-related variables on survival through time. Estimated available useable space ranged from 18.6% to 57.1% of the landscape depending on ambient temperature. The lowest and highest ambient temperature categories (< -15 degrees C and > 35 degrees C, respectively) were associated with the least amount of estimated useable space (18.6% and 24.6%, respectively). Range overlap analysis indicated dissimilarity in areas where Colinus virginianus were restricted during times of thermal extremes (range overlap = 0.38). This suggests that habitat under a given condition is not necessarily a habitat under alternative conditions. Further, we found survival was most influenced by weekly minimum ambient temperatures. Our results demonstrate that ecological constraints can occur along a thermal gradient and that understanding the effects of these discrete events and how they change over time may be more important to conservation of organisms than are average and broad-scale conditions as typically measured in ecological studies.",,,,,"Tanner, Evan/K-9325-2015; Fuhlendorf, Samuel/A-2931-2011","Tanner, Evan/0000-0003-0063-7004; Fuhlendorf, Samuel/0000-0002-8726-9402; Orange, Jeremy/0000-0001-9244-2292",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,MAY,2017,23,5,,,,,1832,1846,,10.1111/gcb.13505,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13505,,,,,,,,27633847,,,,,WOS:000397800600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This experiment measured physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses confined individually to completely shaded (SH) or completely unshaded (SUN) drylot pens during the summer in Davis, CA. Twelve healthy adult horses in a crossover design experienced both treatments for 5 d each. Rectal temperature, respiration rate, skin temperature, and sweat scores were recorded hourly from 1230 to 1730 h daily. Observations were recorded from 1200 to 1800 h for proximity to water, foraging, locomotion, and insect avoidance behaviors. Daily blood samples were obtained to measure cortisol, hematocrit, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Automated and handheld sensors were used to record environmental conditions. The mean ambient temperature from 1200 to 1800 h during the study was 30.6 degrees C. Rectal temperature was greater for horses in SUN than for SH (mean 37.8 degrees C and 37.5 degrees C, respectively, SE = 0.06, P = 0.002) as was respiration rate (25.5 and 20.5 breaths/min, SE = 1.3, P = 0.008), and skin temperature (35.6 degrees C and 34.6 degrees C, SE = 0.1, P < 0.001). Horses in SUN showed sweat in 51.4% of observations vs. 1.1% for horses in SH. Horses in SUN spent more time than SH horses standing near their water source (34.0% of observations vs. 20.2%, SE = 0.3, P = 0.004). No differences were observed for foraging, locomotion, or insect avoidance behavior (P > 0.05). Cortisol concentrations were greater in SUN than SH (3.4 and 2.6 mu g/dL, respectively, P < 0.001) but remained within the normal range for resting horses. No treatment differences were observed for hematocrit or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P > 0.05). Horses exhibited treatment differences in the physiological measures first, most notably in rectal temperature at 1230 h, corresponding to peak solar radiation. Behavioral responses followed these physiological changes, with treatment differences in time standing near water becoming apparent at 1400 h as ambient and black globe temperature increased. Our results indicate that both the SH and SUN treatment groups exhibited thermoregulatory responses to these summer conditions and horses benefited from shade, as it mitigated these physiological and behavioral changes.

Records from 18 climate stations in the Selva Lacandona of Chiapas, Mexico were examined and related to an analysis of deforestation based on Landsat images. The area surrounding some stations has been deforested since the stations were established while the area surrounding others has remained forested. Strong climatic trends were generally evident at the deforested stations, including decreases in the average daily maximum temperature and temperature range. No precipitation changes were observed.

Following extensive theoretical and experimental work, it is shown how the use of a radiometer coaxial with the communications beacon receiver constitutes an excellent tool for an optimum separation regardless of the meteorological conditions along the propagation path and avoids the use of the long-traditional high-pass filter approach. The experimental and theoretical work has revealed that the angular resolution of the radiometer together with the dynamics of rain attenuation and tropospheric scintillations determine the success of the extraction. This is because fast failings require large radiometer antennas in order to resolve the sky temperature fluctuations. The dynamic behavior of rain attenuation has been reanalyzed and adapted for this study with special focus on the Maseng-Bakken (NIB) model and the impact of the slant path on attenuation dynamics. The importance of the antenna pattern in the time response of the radiometer is studied in detail and permits to derive the maximum Fourier component observable for a given antenna size. The theoretical work has been verified by means of extensive experimental results obtained using a dual radiometer system and a beacon receiver tracking the ITALSAT 39.5 GHz F40 beacon. Finally, because of its importance and direct relevance to future communication systems benefiting from fade countermeasure strategies, the minimum size of the radiometer antenna for a successful extraction of amplitude scintillations is determined as a function of the elevation angle and carrier frequency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-926X,,,,,APR,2002,50,4,,,,,535,544,PII S0018-926X(02)01710-6,10.1109/TAP.2002.1003390,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2002.1003390,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000175741600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Water was circulated day and night at fixed supply temperatures of 20-22 degrees C without any other controls. The convective surface heat transfer coefficients of the plenum was modelled in a preliminary CFD study and compared to literature and experiments.

After adult emergence, cold tolerance, life history traits and flight ability were scored. In experiment 2, adult FCM were exposed to 4 or 25 degrees C, with or without vibrations, whereupon flight ability, spontaneous behaviour (i.e., muscle coordination by monitoring whether the moth moved out of a defined circle or not) and cold tolerance were determined. The results of the first experiment showed that FTR led to enhanced cold tolerance, increased flight performance and high egg-laying capacity with minimal costs. The results of the second experiment showed that transport conditions currently in use did not appear to adversely affect flight and cold performance of FCM.

Bulls (4 to 5 mo old, 135 kg body weight [BW]) housed in climate-controlled chambers were subjected to 2 experimental periods (P): (1) TN (18 degrees C to 20 degrees C) and ad libitum intake for 9 d, and (2) HS (cyclical daily temperatures ranging from 29.4 degrees C to 40.0 degrees C) and ad libitum intake or PF (in TN conditions) for 9 d. During each period, blood was collected daily and all calves were subjected to an intravenous insulin tolerance test (ITT) on day 7 and a glucose tolerance test (GTT) on day 8. Heat stress reduced (12%) DMI and by design, PF calves had similar nutrient intake reductions. During P1, BW gain was similar between environments and averaged 1.25 kg/d, and both HS and PF reduced (P<0.01) average daily gain (-0.09 kg/d) during P2. Compared to PF, HS decreased (P<0.05) basal circulating glucose concentrations (7%) and tended (P<0.07) to increase (30%) plasma insulin concentrations, but neither HS nor PF altered plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations. Although there were no treatment differences in P2, both HS and PF increased (P < 0.05) plasma urea nitrogen concentrations (75%) compared with PI. In contrast to P1, both HS and PF had increased (16%) glucose disposal, but compared with PF, HS calves had a greater (67%; P<0.05) insulin response to the GTT. Neither period nor environment acutely affected insulin action, but during P2, calves in both environments tended (P=0.11) to have a blunted overall glucose response to the ITT. Independent of reduced nutrient intake, HS alters post-absorptive carbohydrate (basal and stimulated) metabolism, characterized primarily by increased basal insulin concentrations and insulin response to a GTT. However, HS-induced reduction in feed intake appears to fully explain decreased average daily gain in Holstein bull calves.

However, thermal time is often seen as a loose concept because of a multitude of thermal functions and case-specific parameter values. Our hypothesis is that these different formalisms and parameterization could emerge from common principles and a common response of plant development to temperature, but with several counfounding factors which are not taken into account. We first show that these calculations of thermal time are based on sound common principles and mathematical formalisms. We test, via a modelling exercise of nine case studies using maize plants grown in three field sites, how a given ground truth response of plant development rate to temperature can be affected if an experimenter either considers or ignores confounding factors. We also show that apparent differences in temperature responses between phenological stages of the growth cycle, between day and night, or between plant genotypes may be due to the confounding effects of evaporative demand, the range of temperatures, and the time interval at which measurements are taken. On the basis of our findings, we propose that the critical point in the use of a given formalism of thermal time calculation is to ensure that the chosen model is compatible with the temporal definition, temperature range, and environmental scenario in the considered dataset.",,,,,,"Millet, Emilie/0000-0002-2913-4892",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,APR 15,2019,70,9,,,SI,,2359,2370,,10.1093/jxb/ery402,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ery402,,,,,,,,31091318,,,,,WOS:000469784900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The proposed incubator is composed of various parts including a platform, which is provided for debugging parts to meet the working accuracy of parts. The light windows are adjustable in height to accommodate different heights of light. The incubator is black to prevent stray light in optical experiments. This design can not only insulate but also debug optical or non-optical parts according working accuracy of parts.

The temperature fluctuations of the box of the third optimized incubator reached 0.045 degrees C. To reduce the temperature fluctuations, the relationship between the ambient and target temperature as well as the temperature fluctuations of the box were analyzed, and a formula was proposed. A further experiment provided evidence for this relationship. Based on the formula, the SLITA (small optimized incubator placed in large optimized incubator with the same target temperature) method for improving insulation accuracy was further proposed, and an incubator was designed using this method.

Change in heat tolerance was examined as survival after a 35 degrees C heat shock (2 h) in the course of either a fluctuating temperature regime (8 to 32 degrees C; pre-treated) or a constant temperature (20 degrees C; control) over a period of 24 h. Exposure to a temperature increase from 20 to 32 degrees C (2.4 degrees C min(-1)) induced a significantly increased heat tolerance which continued throughout the experiment. Expression of the gene encoding heat shock protein Hsp70 was assessed at the mRNA level using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR). Hsp70 was rapidly induced and significantly increased by the temperature increase. The relative concentrations of low molecular weight metabolites were analysed in F. candida using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR). A significant metabolomic divergence between pre-treated and control collembolans was evident; partly due to a significantly reduced relative concentration of five free amino acids (arginine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine and tyrosine) in pre-treated collembolans.

Several laboratory and mesocosm experiments have described calcification responses of species and communities to increasing CO2. The few in situ studies on natural coral reefs that have been carried out to date have shown a direct relationship between aragonite saturation state (Omega(arag)) and net community calcification (G(net)). However, these studies have been performed over a limited range of Omega(arag) values, where extrapolation outside the observational range is required to predict future changes in coral reef calcification. We measured extreme diurnal variability in carbonate chemistry within a reef flat in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Omega(arag) varied between 1.1 and 6.5, thus exceeding the magnitude of change expected this century in open ocean subtropical/ tropical waters. The observed variability comes about through biological activity on the reef, where changes to the carbonate chemistry are enhanced at low tide when reef flat waters are isolated from open ocean water. We define a relationship between net community calcification and Omega(arag), using our in situ measurements. We find net community calcification to be linearly related to Omega(arag), while temperature and nutrients had no significant effect on G(net). Using our relationship between G(net) and Omega(arag), we predict that net community calcification will decline by 55% of its preindustrial value by the end of the century. It is not known at this stage whether exposure to large variability in carbonate chemistry will make reef flat organisms more or less vulnerable to the non-calcifying physiological effects of increasing ocean CO2 and future laboratory studies will need to incorporate this natural variability to address this question.",,,,,"Tilbrook, Bronte/A-1522-2012; Tilbrook, Bronte/W-4007-2019; Shaw, Emily/L-4065-2013","Tilbrook, Bronte/0000-0001-9385-3827; Tilbrook, Bronte/0000-0001-9385-3827; Shaw, Emily/0000-0002-4148-3526; McNeil, Ben/0000-0001-5765-7087",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,MAR 27,2012,117,,,,,,,,C03038,10.1029/2011JC007655,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JC007655,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000302241300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the stress response of pregnant pigs to increasing environmental temperatures using heart rate variability, a noninvasive measure commonly used to evaluate the physiological stress response. Our findings show that pregnant pigs, particularly those who are closer to giving birth, exhibit greater evidence of physiological stress compared to pigs who are not pregnant. However, we did not find evidence that increasing environmental temperature throughout the experimental period was a primary reason for the increased stress exhibited by pregnant pigs. It is possible that the physiological changes that normally occur during pregnancy may have masked the physiological stress response typically associated with increased heat exposure. Characterizing the sow physiological response to an increased heat load is essential for effective heat stress mitigation. The study objective was to characterize the effects of a 400-min heating episode on sow heart rate variability (HRV) at different reproductive stages. HRV is a commonly used noninvasive proxy measure of autonomic function. Twenty-seven sows were enrolled in the study according to their gestation stage at time of selection: 1) nonpregnant (NP; n = 7), 2) mid-gestation (MID; 57.3 +/- 11.8 d gestation; n = 11), and 3) late-gestation (LATE; 98.8 +/- 4.9 d gestation; n = 8). The HRV data utilized in the study were collected from each pig as the dry bulb temperature in the room increased incrementally from 19.84 +/- 2.15 degrees C to 35.54 +/- 0.43 degrees C (range: 17.1-37.5 degrees C) over a 400-min period. After data collection, one 5-min set of continuous heart rate data were identified per pig for each of nine temperature intervals (19-20.99, 21-22.99, 23-24.99, 25-26.99, 27-28.99, 29-30.99, 31-32.99, 33-34.99, and 35-36.99 degrees C). Mean inter-beat interval length (RR), standard deviation of r-r intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), high frequency spectral power (HF), sample entropy (SampEn), short-term detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA(alpha 1)), and three measures (%REC, DET, LMEAN) derived from recurrence quantification analysis were calculated for each data set. All data were analyzed using the PROC GLIMMIX procedure in SAS 9.4. Overall, LATE sows exhibited lower RR than NP sows (P < 0.01). The standard deviation of r-r intervals and RMSSD differed between each group (P < 0.01), with LATE sows exhibiting the lowest SDNN and RMSSD and NP sows exhibiting the greatest SDNN and RMSSD. Late-gestation sows exhibited lower HF than both MID and NP sows (P < 0.0001), greater DFA values than NP sows (P = 0.05), and greater DET compared to MID sows (P = 0.001). Late-gestation also sows exhibited greater %REC and LMEAN compared to MID (P < 0.01) and NP sows (all P < 0.01). In conclusion, LATE sows exhibited indicators of greater autonomic stress throughout the heating period compared to MID and NP sows. However, temperature by treatment interactions were not detected as dry bulb increased. Future studies are needed to fully elucidate the effect of gestational stage and increasing dry bulb temperature on sow HRV. Sow heart rate variability is affected by advancing gestation, not dry bulb temperature, during a period of gradually increasing environmental temperature.",,,,,,"Johnson, Jay/0000-0001-5773-4142; Schinckel, Allan/0000-0002-8614-7198",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8812,1525-3163,,,,JAN 1,2022,100,1,,,,,,,skac004,10.1093/jas/skac004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jas/skac004,,,,,,,,35020904,,,,,WOS:000822064900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Five or six hybrids of three maturity classes (early, mid and late) were sown on four or five PDs between 18 September and 15 December of each year. Increasing mean daily temperatures in the range 13-19 degrees C immediately prior to tassel initiation reduced leaf number by 0.1 leaf degrees C-1. Highest leaf area indices were observed at mean daily temperatures of 17-19 degrees C. In the lower latitude environment of Waikato, maximum GY was obtained with earlier plantings than Manawatu. Lower spring temper,atures, and consequently smaller canopy sizes in Manawatu depressed yields of early plantings. When planted early, late hybrids generally outyielded early hybrids while a better balanced source-sink ratio meant that early hybrids yielded consistently across PDs, matching or outyielding late hybrids when both were planted late. Lower grain filling mean temperatures (15 vs. 18 degrees C) and average radiation (11 vs. 20 MJ m(-2) d(-1)) reduced yields more for late than early plantings. Grain yield was highly correlated with kernel number (KN) (r= 0.90***) and weight (KW) (r= 0.76***). Lowest KN, KW and GY values were obtained under late plantings, low rainfall (<20 mm) and/or radiation (<18 MJ m(-2) d(-1)) 10-20d either side of flowering, or when mean temperatures <= 15 degrees C or irradiance <11 MJ m(-2) d(-1) occurred during grain filling. Kernel number, KW and GY responses to late planting or water stress were more apparent in late than early hybrids. Kernel weight was more stable than MN under late planting or water stress conditions. Water stress during grain filling affected late PDs more than early PDs.

This studys objective was to investigate the effects of short-time temperature abuse during processing on spoilage of chilled saithe (Pollachius virens) fillets. Analysis of microbial growth, freshness grades, and sensory score by Quality Index method, as well as pH, were carried out during a 10-d storage period at 2 +/- 2 degrees C. Before storage, the fillets were kept at 16 degrees C for 0, 1, and 2 h. The results showed that spoilage of the fillets was accelerated with longer holding time at 16 degrees C. The 1- and 2-h holding before packing and storage caused a 22% (2 d) and 44% (4 d) loss of shelf life, respectively, compared to fillets that were packed immediately after processing. These findings indicate how bottlenecks and delays during processing may result in loss of microbial and sensory quality of chilled fish products. Practical ApplicationThe observations show the importance of maintaining a low temperature in fish, even for a short period such as during processing. Any delays, such as due to buffering or mechanical failure, may accelerate spoilage of chilled products during subsequent storage.

Drivers, such as climate change and increasing herbivore pressure, affect the moss layer thus, assessment of the functional role of mosses in determining soil characteristics is essential. Field manipulations conducted in high arctic Spitsbergen (78 degrees N), creating shallow (3 cm), intermediate (6 cm) and deep (12 cm) moss layers over the soil surface, had an immediate impact on soil temperature in terms of both average temperatures and amplitude of fluctuations. In soil under deep moss, temperature was substantially lower and organic layer thaw occurred 4 weeks later than in other treatment plots; the growing season for vascular plants was thereby reduced by 40%. Soil moisture was also reduced under deep moss, reflecting the influence of local heterogeneity in moss depth, over and above the landscape-scale topographic control of soil moisture. Data from field and laboratory experiments show that moss-mediated effects on the soil environment influenced microbial biomass and activity, resulting in warmer and wetter soil under thinner moss layers containing more plant-available nitrogen. In arctic ecosystems, which are limited by soil temperature, growing season length and nutrient availability, spatial and temporal variation in the depth of the moss layer has significant repercussions for ecosystem function. Evidence from our mesic tundra site shows that any disturbance causing reduction in the depth of the moss layer will alleviate temperature and moisture constraints and therefore profoundly influence a wide range of ecosystem processes, including nutrient cycling and energy transfer.",,,,,"van der Wal, Rene/F-3177-2010","Jonsdottir, Ingibjorg Svala/0000-0003-3804-7077",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,OCT,2007,153,4,,,,,931,941,,10.1007/s00442-007-0785-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-007-0785-0,,,,,,,,17618466,,,,,WOS:000249407000014,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Hogan, JD; Murray, EE; Harrison, MA",,,,"Hogan, Justin D.; Murray, Elizabeth E.; Harrison, Marcia A.",,,Ethylene production as an indicator of stress conditions in hydroponically-grown strawberries,SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a soilless system, hydroponics eliminates competing weeds and soil-born pests while conserving water and providing conditions that can be quickly altered to suit specific crops. However, stress-induced physiological conditions may arise within the system from factors such as mechanical injury, pests, or inconsistent nutrient flow rates that result in some plants receiving too much or too little water. Most abiotic stress conditions result in increased production of the plant hormone ethylene. High levels of ethylene inhibit growth, cause premature ripening, and induce the onset of senescence, potentially reducing the productivity of hydroponically-grown crops. In this study, we demonstrate that assessing ethylene levels from leaves of hydroponically-grown strawberry plants can be used as an early indicator of stress conditions. Our results demonstrate that there is no significant correlation between ethylene production and temperatures ranging from 15 to 37 degrees C or with light intensities ranging from 63 to 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, an increase in ethylene production tended to be positively correlated with sampling time; levels were higher during midday compared to early morning or later afternoon. The daily ethylene fluctuations under greenhouse conditions due to sampling time, light intensity, or temperature changes were not significantly high enough to indicate stress conditions. Overall, three system analyses showed altered ethylene production in plants farthest from the pump supplying the nutrient solution. This effect was interpreted to be caused by excess accumulation of nutrient solution around the plant roots, causing increased ethylene production in the leaves. Our results indicate that different watering patterns, manifested as pump pressure or drainage control, was the more difficult component to control in the design of these hydroponic systems. For example, in one system, an increase in ethylene production was measured for the position farthest from the pump, and resulted in those plants having a lower number of flowers and significantly reduced overall plant radii relative to the system average. In a separate experiment, plants from trays that had been flooded for 24 h showed a significant decrease in the plant radii and number of leaves and flowers I month after the flooding treatment. We conclude that system-wide ethylene measurements can be used to identify stressed plants within hydroponic systems. This type of analysis would be e specially useful as an indicator of general stress conditions no matter the cause, identifying locations that may result in lower plant productivity.

Like many successfully farmed seaweed species, the sustainable development of Hizikia farming will rely on a stable supply of artificial seedlings via sexual reproduction under controlled conditions. However, the high rate of detachment of seedlings after transfer to open sea is one of the main obstacles, and has limited large-scale application of zygote-derived seedlings. To seek the optimal condition for growing seedlings on substratum in land-based tanks for avoidance of detachment in this investigation, young seedlings were grown in both outdoor tanks exposed directly to sunlight and in indoor raceway tanks in reduced, filtered sunlight. Results showed that young seedlings, immediately after fertilization, could withstand a daily fluctuation of direct solar irradiance up to a level of 1800 mu mol photons m(-1)s(-1), and maintained a faster growth rate than seedlings grown in indoor tanks. Detailed experiments by use of chlorophyll fluorescence measurements further demonstrated that the overnight (12 h) recovery of optimal fluorescence quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of seedlings after 1 h treatment at 40 degrees C was 98%, and the 48 h recovery of F-v/F-m of seedlings after 1 h exposure to 1800 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) was 92%. Forty-one-day-old seedlings showed no significant decrease of optimal fluorescence quantum yield at salinity ranging from 30 to 5 ppt for a treatment up to 17 h. Six-hour desiccation treatment did not have any influence on the optimal fluorescence quantum yield. Exposure to 18 mmol L-1 sodium hypochlorite for 10 min did not damage the PSII efficiency, and thus could be used to remove epiphytic algae. The strong tolerance of young seedlings to high temperature, high irradiance, low salinity and desiccation found in this investigation supports the view that mass production of Hizikia seedlings should be performed in ambient light and temperature instead of in shaded greenhouse tanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0921-8971,1573-5176,,,,OCT,2007,19,5,,,,,557,565,,10.1007/s10811-007-9170-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-007-9170-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000249205500023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Quantifying carbon and water fluxes as well as investigating their environmental drivers over cotton fields is critical for understanding regional carbon and water budgets in Xinjiang, the largest cotton production basin of China. In this study, an eddy covariance (EC) technique was used to measure the carbon and water fluxes of cotton field under drip irrigation with plastic mulch in the growing seasons of 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013 at Wulanwusu Agrometeorological Experiment Station, a representative oasis cropland in northern Xinjiang. The diurnal patterns of gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and evapotranspiration (ET) showed obviously sinusoidal variations from June to September, while the diurnal ecosystem respiration (R-es) was stable between daytime and nighttime. The daytime hourly GPP and ET displayed asymptotic relationships with net solar radiation (R-net), while showed concave patterns with raising vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and air temperature (T-a). The increases in hourly GPP and ET towards the maximum occurred over half ranges of VPD and T-a. The seasonal variations of GPP, NEE and ET were close to the cotton phenology, which almost reached the peak value in July.

However, no studies have determined whether artificial seed banks are representative of natural seed banks. We compared the emergence of velvetleaf, giant foxtail, and common waterhemp in a natural seed bank, an artificial seed bank with stratified seeds, and an artificial seed bank with nonstratified seeds. Velvetleaf seedling emergence was higher in the nonstratified seed bank in 2001, but no differences were observed in 2002. The number of viable velvetleaf seeds at the end of the experiment was lower in the natural seed bank than in the artificial seed banks in 2002. Velvetleaf emergence occurred earlier in the natural seed bank than in the artificial seed banks. Giant foxtail emergence was higher in the artificial seed banks (58 to 82%) than in the natural seed bank (5 to 23%). Common waterhemp emergence ranged from 7 to 65% in the artificial seed banks and from 1 to 5% in the natural seed bank. In general, the distribution of emergence with time differed in the natural seed bank compared with the artificial seed banks. These differences were attributed to differences in soil temperature and soil bulk density between the natural and artificial seed banks.

In nature, however, the thermal environment is more complex. Aerial exposure and the unpredictable nature of thermal stress during low tides may be critical factors in defining the thermal physiology of intertidal organisms. In the fingered limpet, Lottia digitalis, we investigated whether upper temperature tolerance and thermal sensitivity were influenced by the pattern of fluctuation with which thermal stress was applied. Specifically, we examined whether there was a differential response (measured as cardiac performance) to repeated heat stress of a constant and predictable magnitude compared with heat stress applied in a stochastic and unpredictable nature. We also investigated differences in cellular metabolism and damage following immersion for insights into biochemical mechanisms of tolerance. Upper temperature tolerance increased with aerial exposure, but no significant differences were found between predictable treatments of varying magnitudes (13 degrees C versus 24 degrees C versus 32 degrees C). Significant differences in thermal tolerance were found between unpredictable trials with different heating patterns. There were no significant differences among treatments in basal citrate synthase activity, glycogen content, oxidative stress or antioxidants.

Evaporative water loss and oxygen consumption rates of birds breathing normally (nasopharyngeal breathing) and with nasal turbinates experimentally bypassed (oropharyngeal breathing) were measured. Water and heat loss rates were calculated from lung tidal volumes and nasal and oropharyngeal exhaled air temperatures (T-ex). Resulting data indicate that respiratory turbinates are equally adaptive across a range of avian orders, regardless of environment, by conserving significant fractions of the daily water and heat budget. Nasal T-ex of birds was compared to that of lizards, which lack respiratory turbinates.

Growth and grazing rates were determined by dilution experiments at select stations along the WAP in January of 2009 to 2011 and in the nearshore waters near Palmer Station in February and March 2011. Microzooplankton exerted higher grazing pressure on bacteria compared to phytoplankton along the WAP and also selectively grazed on smaller phytoplankton (picoautotrophs and nanophytoplankton) and on the more actively growing (high nucleic acid) bacterial cells. Among all phytoplankton size classes, growth rates ranged from undetectable (i.e. not significant; NS) to 0.99 d(-1), grazing mortality rates were NS to 0.56 d(-1), and microzooplankton removed <100% of daily phytoplankton production in all but one experiment. For high and low nucleic acid content bacteria, growth rates were NS to 0.95 d(-1), and grazing mortality rates were NS to 0.43 d(-1); microzooplankton often removed >100% of daily bacterial production. There was a significant (albeit weak) exponential relationship between temperature and phytoplankton mortality, although the range of experimental temperatures was small.

This paper evaluated whether the body size of the butterfly Dryas iulia from subtropical populations was influenced by changing climate conditions and food source availability during the seasons. The likely reasons behind body size variation were also investigated. First, field data on body size variation, host-plant availability and climate fluctuation throughout the seasons were recorded. Then, the effects of host-plant species and temperature on body size were analyzed by controlled experiments. Field data revealed that body size and host-plant availability varied significantly through the seasons. Populations had the smallest body size during the spring and the biggest size during summer, whereas host-plant availability was lower during winter and higher during spring. The controlled experiments revealed that both temperature and host-plant had significant effect on the plasticity of body size. Larvae subjected to winter temperature treatment led to smaller butterflies when compared to immatures reared under summer temperature treatment, and larvae fed with Passiflora misera produced bigger adults when compared to larvae reared on Passiflora suberosa. The combination of data gathered in the field and in the laboratory suggests that seasonal body size variation in D.iulia is related mainly to differences in the temperatures to which larvae are subjected during development, while host-plant shifts caused by differential availability of food through the seasons had slightly effects on the variation observed.",,,,,,"Oliveira Mega, Nicolas/0000-0002-9200-1558",,,,,,,,,,,,,1343-8786,1479-8298,,,,OCT,2014,17,4,,,,,376,387,,10.1111/ens.12077,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ens.12077,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000342900900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was applied to assess changes in watershed hydrology with the CORDEX-Africa data. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Streamflow Drought Index (SDI), and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) were calculated to identify the characteristics of meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural droughts, respectively. Due to a significant rise in temperature, evapotranspiration will increase by up to 16.8% by the end of the 21st century. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, the annual average rainfall is estimated to decrease by 38.3% in the far future period, inducing a reduction of streamflow of up to 37.5%. Projections in reduced diurnal temperature range might benefit crop growth but suggest elevated heat stress. Probabilities of drought occurrence are expected to be doubled in the far future period, with increased intensities for all three types of droughts.

These methods will be explained in detail in different sections. Honey bees are model organisms in behavioural biology for their complex yet plastic division of labour. To observe the daily behaviour of individual bees in a colony, classical observation hives are very useful. The setting up and use of typical observation hives will be the focus of another section.

Endotherms are known to maintain high core body temperatures, but temperatures in the periphery of the body can fluctuate.

We examined a wing muscle in the small-bodied tropical bat Carollia perspicillata and a hindlimb muscle in the laboratory mouse at 5 degrees C intervals from 22 to 42 degrees C to determine the thermal dependence of the contractile properties of both muscles. We found that the bat extensor carpi radial is longus had low thermal dependence from near body temperature to 10 degrees C lower, with Q(10) values of less than 1.5 for relaxation from contraction and shortening velocities in that interval, and with no significant difference in some rate properties in the interval between 32 and 37 degrees C. In contrast, for all temperature intervals below 37 degrees C, Q(10) values for the mouse extensor digitorum longus were 1.5 or higher, and rate properties differed significantly across successive temperature intervals from 37 to 22 degrees C. An ANCOVA analysis found that the thermal dependencies of all measured isometric and isotonic rate processes were significantly different between the bat and mouse muscles. The relatively low thermal dependence of the bat muscle likely represents a downward shift of its optimal temperature and may be functionally significant in light of the variable operating temperatures of bat wing muscles.",,,,,"; Swartz, Sharon/B-9309-2011","Rummel, Andrea/0000-0003-2627-8038; Swartz, Sharon/0000-0001-5762-7435",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUL,2018,221,14,,,,,,,,10.1242/jeb.180166,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.180166,,,,,,,,29844201,,,,,WOS:000440579100028,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whether a temperate species can immigrate into an ice-free Arctic depends on its ability to tolerate extreme seasonal fluctuations in daylength. Thus, understanding adaptations to polar light conditions can improve the realism of models predicting poleward range expansions in response to climate change. Plant adaptations to polar light have rarely been studied and remain unknown in seagrasses. If these ecosystem engineers can migrate polewards, seagrasses will enrich biodiversity, and carbon capture potential in shallow coastal regions of the Arctic. Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is the most widely distributed seagrass in the northern hemisphere. As the only seagrass species growing as far north as 70 degrees N, it is the most likely candidate to first immigrate into an ice-free Arctic. Here, we describe seasonal (and diurnal) changes in photosynthetic characteristics, and in genome-wide gene expression patterns under strong annual fluctuations of daylength. We compared PAM measurements and RNA-seq data between two populations at the longest and shortest day of the year: (1) a Mediterranean population exposed to moderate annual fluctuations of 10-14 h daylength and (2) an Arctic population exposed to high annual fluctuations of 0-24 h daylength. Most of the gene expression specificities of the Arctic population were found in functions of the organelles (chloroplast and mitochondrion). In winter, Arctic eelgrass conserves energy by repressing respiration and reducing photosynthetic energy fluxes. Although light-reactions, and genes involved in carbon capture and carbon storage were upregulated in summer, enzymes involved in CO2 fixation and chlorophyll-synthesis were upregulated in winter, suggesting that winter metabolism relies not only on stored energy resources but also on active use of dim light conditions. Eelgrass is unable to use excessive amounts of light during summer and demonstrates a significant reduction in photosynthetic performance under long daylengths, possibly to prevent photoinhibition constrains. Our study identified key mechanisms that allow eelgrass to survive under Arctic light conditions and paves the way for experimental research to predict whether and up to which latitude eelgrass can potentially migrate polewards in response to climate change.",,,,,"Arnaud-Haond, Sophie/B-2479-2008; Duarte, Bernardo/H-2001-2011","Arnaud-Haond, Sophie/0000-0001-5814-8452; Duarte, Bernardo/0000-0003-1914-7435; Olsen, Jeanine L./0000-0003-3091-0163",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-462X,,,,,DEC 2,2021,12,,,,,,,,745855,10.3389/fpls.2021.745855,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.745855,,,,,,,,34925400,,,,,WOS:000730869600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, summertime grazing in arid zones entails major challenges to animal thermoregulation and well-being. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the thermoregulatory performance and selected hemogramic parameters in intensively (INT) or extensively (EXT) managed goat kids (N = 14). We applied a previously established technique to evaluate body thermal state of freely ranging animals, in which contemporaneous temperatures of the core (T-c) and periphery (T-p) are chronically recorded. Animals were initially kept for 12 days under INT management. Subsequently, seven animals were transferred to a grazing pasture and gradually transitioned over a four-day acclimatization period, then kept for the last 22 days under EXT conditions. Water drinking was limited to twice daily in both groups. Excessive solar radiation-induced heat load - with daytime black globe temperatures (T-bg) often exceeding 40 degrees C - under EXT was primarily responsible (r(2) = 0.49: P < 0.05) for 0.57 and 1.72 degrees C rises in T-c and T-p, respectively, over INT kids. Unlike the typically biphasic pattern noticed for daily temperatures of both body sites in INT goats, that of EXT counterparts became rather polyphasic, whereby water drinking had drastic and prolonged thermolytic effect, inducing 0.40-0.41 and 0.79-1.45 degrees C declines in T-c and T-p on midday and afternoon watering bouts, respectively. Despite indication for added daytime heat load. EXT goats displayed lower early morning T-c than INT. All animals exhibited hypohydration, as reflected by rises in hematocrit, serum osmolality, albumin, potassium, and sodium, being more pronounced in EXT conditions.

And a better understanding of StWC contributes to solving some research hotspots in forestry, such as drought resistance, cold resistance, precise irrigation, and health assessment. However, there are few noninvasive, in situ, real-time, safe, and low-cost methods for detecting StWC of woody plants. This article presents a novel sensor for noninvasive detection of in situ StWC based on standing wave ratio. Moreover, extensive experiments were conducted to analyze the performance of this sensor including sensitive distance, measuring range, influence factors, and measuring accuracy. The experimental results show that the sensitive distance of StWC sensor is approximately 53mm in axial direction and 20mm in radial direction with the measuring range from 0.01 to 1.00cm(3)cm(-3). The combined effects of stem EC and temperature on sensor output are significant and it is necessary to correct the error caused by the two factors. Compared with the oven-drying method, StWC sensor has higher measuring accuracy than Testo 606-2 which is a sensor for measuring wood water content and its average error is less than 0.01cm(3)cm(-3).

Climate change can alter thermal regimes and influence water temperatures. This study aims to investigate probable impacts of climate change (predicted changes in meteorological forcing variables) on the thermal regime and macroinvertebrate species of a regulated prairie river. A 2D laterally averaged CE-QUAL-W2 hydrodynamic thermal lake model for Lake Diefenbaker was coupled with a Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program Version 7 (WASP7) river temperature model and applied to the lower South Saskatchewan River in Canada. Three decades, 2001-2010, 2041-2050, and 2081-2090, were modelled using atmospheric forcing data (relative humidity, dew point, daily mean near-surface wind velocity, near-surface air temperature, total cloud fraction, and surface air pressure) from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis experiments (CORDEX). To estimate future climate change impacts on the resident macroinvertebrate species, the known temperature tolerances of various macroinvertebrate species were compared with modelled temperature regimes. The WASP model calibration (2011-2012) and validation (2013) outputs produced an acceptable visual fit, whereby predicted values overlap sampled values, to observed water temperatures at Clarkboro and Muskoday sample sites. Major effects on the thermal regime were simulated due to the increase in water temperature induced by Gardiner Dam, which in turn indicated a possible effect on macroinvertebrate species. Gardiner Dam was also shown to be highly sensitive to inflow variations as well as to temperature changes. These findings contribute to the understanding of how future climate-induced river water temperature changes may influence macroinvertebrate species in temperate river systems.

A Review, Experiment and Conceptual Framework",PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Global warming, and nutrient and sediment runoff from coastal development, both exert increasing pressures on coastal coral reefs. The objective of this study was to resolve the question of whether coastal eutrophication may protect corals from thermal stress by improving their nutritional status, or rather diminish their thermal tolerance through the synergy of dual stressors. A review of previous studies on the topic of combined trophic status and heat exposure on the thermal tolerance of corals reveals a broad range of outcomes, including synergistic, additive and antagonistic effects. We conducted a 90-day long experiment exposing corals to realistic levels of elevated nutrients and sediments, and heat stress. Colonies of two common scleractinian corals (Acropora millepora and Montipora tuberculosa) were kept in coastal seawater, or coastal seawater that was further organically and nutrient enriched (OE), and/or enriched with nitrate. Batches of OE were created daily, facilitating nutrient uptake, plankton succession and organic enrichment as observed in coastal waters. After 10 days of acclimation, 67% of the colonies had their temperature gradually increased from 27 degrees to 31.2 degrees C. After 3-7 weeks of heat stress, colonies of both species had significantly greater reductions in fluorescence yields and lower survival in OE than without addition of OE. Furthermore, photophysiological recovery was incomplete 31-38 days after ending the heat stress only in the OE treatments. Nitrate alone had no measurable effect on survival, bleaching and recovery in either species. Skeletal growth rates were reduced by 45% in heat-stressed A. millepora and by 24% in OE-exposed M. tuberculosa. We propose a conceptual trophic framework that resolves some of the apparently contradictory outcomes revealed by the review. Our study shows that management actions to reduce coastal eutrophication can improve the resistance and resilience of vulnerable coastal coral reefs to warming temperatures.",,,,,"Fabricius, Katharina E/F-1759-2010","Fabricius, Katharina E/0000-0001-7671-4358; Humphrey, Craig/0000-0002-1303-036X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JAN 17,2013,8,1,,,,,,,e54399,10.1371/journal.pone.0054399,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054399,,,,,,,,23349876,,,,,WOS:000313738900064,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding how this occurs in parasite-host systems is important for appreciating long-term and seasonal changes in host exposure to infection and to reduce species extinction caused by diseases. We investigated how free-living stages of two soil-transmitted helminths of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) responded to experimental changes in temperature by performing laboratory experiments with environmental chambers and field manipulations using open-top-chambers. This study was motivated by our previous observations that air temperature has increased over the last 30years in our field site and that during this period intensity of infection of Graphidium strigosum but not Trichostrongylus retortaeformis was positively associated with this temperature increase. Laboratory and field experiments showed that both parasites accelerated egg development and increased hatching rate and larval survival in response to accumulating thermal energy. Both parasites behaved similarly when exposed to diverse temperature regimes, decadal trends, and monthly fluctuations, however, T. retortaeformis was more successful than G. strigosum by showing higher rates of egg hatching and larval survival. Across the months, the first day of hatching occurred earlier in warmer conditions suggesting that climate warming can lengthen the period of parasite growth and host exposure to infective stages. Also, T. retortaeformis hatched earlier than G. strigosum. These findings showed that seasonal changes in intensity, frequency, and duration of daily temperature are important causes of variability in egg hatching and larva survival. Overall, this study emphasizes the important role of climate warming and seasonality on the dynamics of free-living stages in soil-transmitted helminths and their contribution to enhance host exposure to parasitic infections.

The review encompasses observations, empirical studies, theory and modeling of the extratropical teleconnections with a focus on developments over the Tropical Oceans-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) decade and the current state of understanding. In the tropical atmosphere, anomalous SSTs force anomalies in convection and large-scale overturning with subsidence in the descending branch of the local Hadley circulation. The resulting strong upper tropospheric divergence in the tropics and convergence in the subtropics act as a Rossby wave source. The climatological stationary planetary waves and associated jet streams, especially in the northern hemisphere, can make the total Rossby wave sources somewhat insensitive to the position of the tropical heating that induces them and thus can create preferred teleconnection response patterns, such as the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. However, a number of factors influence the dispersion and propagation of Rossby waves through the atmosphere, including zonal asymmetries in the climatological state, transients, and baroclinic and nonlinear effects. Internal midlatitude sources can amplify perturbations. Observations, modeling, and theory have clearly shown how storm tracks change in response to changes in quasi-stationary waves and how these changes generally feedback to.maintain or strengthen the dominant perturbations through vorticity and momentum transports. The response of the extratropical atmosphere naturally induces changes in the underlying surface, so that there are changes in extratropical SSTs and changes in land surface hydrology and moisture availability that can feedback and influence the total response. Land surface processes are believed to be especially important in spring and summer. Anomalous SSTs and tropical forcing have tended to be strongest in the northern winter, and teleconnections in the southern hemisphere are weaker and more variable and thus more inclined to be masked by natural variability. Occasional strong forcing in seasons other than winter can produce strong and identifiable signals in the northern hemisphere and, because the noise of natural variability is less, the signal-to-noise ratio can be Large. The relative importance of tropical versus extratropical SST forcings has been established through numerical experiments with atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). Predictability of anomalous circulation and associated surface temperature and precipitation in the extratropics is somewhat limited by the difficulty of finding a modest signal embedded in the high level of noise from natural variability in the extra;tropics, and the complexity and variety of the possible feedbacks. Accordingly, ensembles of AGCM runs and time averaging are needed to identify signals and make predictions. Strong anomalous tropical forcing provides opportunities for skillful forecasts, and the accuracy and usefulness of forecasts is expected to improve as the ability to forecast the anomalous SSTs improves, as models improve, and as the information available from the mean and the spread of ensemble forecasts is better utilized.",,,,,", AK/B-6517-2008; Karoly, David J/C-8262-2011; Trenberth, Kevin Edward/A-5683-2012","Karoly, David J/0000-0002-8671-2994; Trenberth, Kevin Edward/0000-0002-1445-1000",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,JUN 29,1998,103,C7,,,,,14291,14324,,10.1029/97JC01444,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97JC01444,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000074477900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to the lack of in-situ observations, the satellite with high spatial and temporal coverage plays a vital role in improving the data coverage as well as improving global ocean analysis. In this study, the global Nucleus European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO)-based three-dimensional variational assimilation system called NEMOVAR is used to understand the impact of satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) data assimilation in the Tropical Indian Ocean (TIO). Two different experiments, such as no assimilation of satellite-derived SST called CNTR and assimilation of satellite-derived SST called EXPSST, were carried out during the winter and summer monsoon. The SST increment is much smooth for the CNTR experiment as compared to the EXPSST experiment. The comparison of daily SST from both experiments with the Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA) buoy observations clearly showed less RMSE and high correlation in the EXPSST experiment in the western part of the southern Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea (AS) regions during the winter monsoon. Further, the EXPSST experiment is cooler than the CNTR experiment in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and southern Indian Ocean (10 degrees-20 degrees S) regions for winter monsoon and AS, BoB and Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) regions for summer monsoon. Due to this, the EXPSST experiment lost the net heat flux (NHF) much less than the CNTR experiment. The impact of satellite-derived SST observations on the variational assimilation system through the air-sea interaction is relatively larger during summer monsoon as compared to winter monsoon. Further, it is also suggested that the impact is relatively higher in the BoB region compared to the northern AS and EIO regions extending up to 40-60 m depth during both monsoon seasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0255-660X,0974-3006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12524-022-01586-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-022-01586-9,,JUL 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000827921100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To identify potential changes in the ozone drivers, the weather pattern shifts were analyzed through the horizontal distri-bution trends of temperature at 2 m and geopotential height at 850 hPa. A strengthening of the Azores anti-cyclone and a regional warming were detected, which could contribute to the ozone trends obtained. The surface ozone trend in every month was explored, identifying a monthly pattern, with remarkable opposite trends in December-January (2.4 +/- 0.9 ppb decade1) vs July-August (0.5 +/- 1.1 ppb decade1). The surface ozone trends for every hour of the day were also explored, identifying two clear patterns. The first pattern occurred from spring to autumn and was characterized by a behavior opposite to the typical daily ozone cycle. The second pattern was observed in winter, and it shows two relative peaks in the ozone trends (around 13:00 and 19:00 UTC). In a context of ozone precursor's depletion, changes in the weather conditions and warmer climate, to improve our knowledge of the ozone trends, we suggest exploring them based on daily and hourly averages.",,,,,"Bolivar, Juan Pedro/F-1582-2017; Jose, Adame/K-3951-2014","Bolivar, Juan Pedro/0000-0001-9258-6341; Jose, Adame/0000-0002-6302-7193",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-9351,1096-0953,,,,NOV,2022,214,,1,,,,,,113887,10.1016/j.envres.2022.113887,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.113887,,,,,,,,35835171,,,,,WOS:000837004900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Generally, broadly distributed species show variation in thermal physiology between populations. Within their distributional ranges, populations at the edges are assumed to experience more challenging environments than central populations (fundamental niche breadth hypothesis). We have investigated differences in thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity under increasing/decreasing temperatures among geographically separated populations of the sandhopper Talorchestia capensis along the South African coasts. We tested whether the thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of T. capensis differ between central and marginal populations using a non-parametric constraint space analysis. We linked thermal sensitivity to environmental history by using historical climatic data to evaluate whether individual responses to temperature could be related to natural long-term fluctuations in air temperatures. Our results demonstrate that there were significant differences in the thermal response of T. capensis populations to both increasing/decreasing temperatures. Thermal sensitivity (for increasing temperatures only) was negatively related to temperature variability and positively related to temperature predictability. Two different models fitted the geographical distribution of thermal sensitivity and thermal tolerance. Our results confirm that widespread species show differences in physiology among populations by providing evidence of contrasting thermal responses in individuals subject to different environmental conditions at the limits of the species' spatial range. When considering the complex interactions between individual physiology and species ranges, it is not sufficient to consider mean environmental temperatures, or even temperature variability; the predictability of that variability may be critical.",,,,,"McQuaid, Christopher/AAT-3725-2020; Porri, Francesca/M-4258-2017; Cannicci, Stefano/N-8512-2019","McQuaid, Christopher/0000-0002-3473-8308; Porri, Francesca/0000-0001-8247-4506; Cannicci, Stefano/0000-0002-6544-0213; Baldanzi, Simone/0000-0002-7153-4734; Weidberg, Nicolas/0000-0001-5726-518X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,DEC,2015,179,4,,,,,1067,1078,,10.1007/s00442-015-3404-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-015-3404-5,,,,,,,,26232091,,,,,WOS:000364226900013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Concurrently, we monitored weather conditions and used time-activity budget data of free-living birds and laboratory data on resting metabolic rate to construct time-activity laboratory (TAL) estimates of daily energy expenditure (DEE) and to partition the verdins' energy budget into thermoregulatory, activity and basal components. The FMR of adult verdins was 33.6+/-0.9 kJ day(-1) (mean +/- S.E.M.; N=14) in winter and 22.8+/-0.45 kJ day(-1) (N=7) in summer. FMR correlated negatively with the mean standard operative environmental temperature (T-es) prevailing during the measurement period. TAL analysis produced DEE estimates that corresponded on average to within -0.9+/-2.4% of our DLW-measured FMR values (range of individual values -18.3% to +14.3%). Metabolic expeditures for cold defense were 19.5+/-2.1% of DEE in winter (computed assuming substitution of exercise thermogenesis for thermoregulatory costs in active birds). In the summer, thermoregulatory costs amounted to 9.0+/-0.4% of DEE for keeping warm and 1.0+/-0.1% of DEE for keeping cool in the heat. Activity costs were 21.0+/-0.5% of DEE in winter and 17.5+/-0.1% of DEE in summer.

Yet the factors driving variation in selected or preferred body temperature (T-set) and its usefulness as a proxy for optimal physiological temperature (T-opt) are still debated. Although T-set is often conserved among closely related species, substantial variation at the individual, population and species level has also been reported. However, the repeatability (calculated as the intra-class correlation coefficient) of T-set is generally low. One factor that influences T-set is feeding status, with fed reptiles typically showing higher T-set, a process thought to aid meal digestion. Here, using experiments simulating realistic feeding and fasting regimes in Agama atra, a heliothermic lizard from southern Africa, we test if T-set and its repeatability under these 2 states significantly differ. Daily T-set ranged from 33.7 to 38.4 degrees C, with a mean (+/- SE) of 36.7 +/- 0.1 degrees C for fed and 36.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C for unfed individuals. Comparisons of repeatability showed that females tend to be more consistent in the selection of body temperature than males, but not significantly so regardless of feeding status. We report some of the highest repeatability estimates of T-set to date (full range: 0.229-0.642), and that the weak positive effects of feeding status on T-set did not increase its repeatability. In conclusion, one of the major prerequisites for natural selection, consistent among-individual variation, is present, making the adaptive significance of T-set considerably more plausible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1749-4877,1749-4869,,,,JUL,2018,13,4,,,SI,,482,493,,10.1111/1749-4877.12325,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12325,,,,,,,,29722138,,,,,WOS:000439929600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, climate change is projected to result in milder winters, which may enable cultivation of winter crops to a greater extent in the future than is possible today. In this study we aimed at identifying main temperature, precipitation events and characteristics that have resulted in past poor overwintering of rye and wheat in their current production areas in Finland. Using long-term (1970-2006), multi-location datasets, we compared our findings with the projected major changes attributable to climate change. Mixed models were used to estimate mutually comparable overwintering damage to all experiments and logistic regression was used to determine whether climatic parameters are related to high levels of overwintering damage. Severity of overwintering damage, and associated yield penalties, fluctuate considerably on a year-to-year basis and no consistent reduction in variability was recorded during the study period. Particularly for wheat, severity of winter damage in any one year was associated negatively with area sown in the following year. There was no evidence of consistent genetic improvements in winter hardiness, but rye was more winter hardy than wheat. Current risks associated with rye production related to low temperatures could be alleviated in the future, although overwintering damage currently enhanced by high autumn precipitation could increase due to climate change. For wheat, fluctuating conditions hampered overwintering, which may be an even harder challenge in future when weather variation is projected to increase and extreme weather events are projected to become more common.",,,,,"Hakala, Kaija/E-3745-2017","Hakala, Kaija/0000-0002-0172-1892; Jauhiainen, Lauri/0000-0003-2073-1057",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-4710,1651-1913,,,,,2011,61,1,,,,,75,83,,10.1080/09064710903535977,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710903535977,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000286923800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thick-tailed geckos Nephrurus milii are large lizards that are widely distributed through southern Australia. These nocturnally active animals typically spend daylight hours under surface rocks. We presented captive geckos with alternative retreat-sites (rock crevices) differing in attributes potentially relevant to habitat selection. The lizards showed strong preference for shelter-sites that enhanced thermoregulation (warm rather than cool) and that reduced the animal's vulnerability to predators (narrow crevices with small openings and not containing the scent of a predatory snake). Horizontal rather than sloping crevices were also preferred. Overall crevice size and thickness of the overlying rock did not influence retreat-site selection in the laboratory, but could be important in the field because of their influence on thermal regimes under rocks. The present study supports the idea that nocturnal reptiles base their selection of diurnal shelters on multiple aspects related to the fitness consequences of occupancy of alternative available retreat-sites.",,,,,"Shine, Richard/B-8711-2008; Kearney, Michael/R-3404-2017","Kearney, Michael/0000-0002-3349-8744",,,,,,,,,,,,,1442-9985,1442-9993,,,,OCT,2004,29,5,,,,,547,552,,10.1111/j.1442-9993.2004.01388.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2004.01388.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000224619800006,View Full Record in Web of Science
