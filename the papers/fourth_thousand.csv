Host exploitation strategies in three Chrysomelidae species associated with Asteraceae host plants,ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Phytophagous insects which feed on the leaves of herbaceous host plants have to adapt their life histories to the fact that protein nitrogen is usually highest in growing tissues in spring. We monitored field populations of larvae and adults of three chrysomelid species (Galeruca tanaceti (L.) (main host Achillea millefolium (L.) Yarrow), Cassida rubiginosa (Mueller) (main host Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) and Oreina luctuosa (Suffrian) (host Centaurea scabiosa (L.)) together with the amount of protein nitrogen of their food resources and host plant biomass. As expected, the development of host quality, measured as concentration of protein nitrogen, and host plant biomass showed inverse trends during the season. The euryphagous G. tanaceti attacks Achillea early and profits from high nitrogen concentrations in the leaves. Occasional overexploitations of local populations of Achillea are compensated by the capacity to move to other host species. In C. rubiginosa, a species with a host range restricted to the Cardueae, the main larval feeding activity is postponed to a period when the nitrogen content of the host leaves had dropped to 50% of its initial value, but when host plant biomass had increased by 30%. In the monophagous O. luctuosa the larval development is synchronized with a still later phase of host phenology, at which the nitrogen content is below 50% but plant biomass has reached its maximum. There seem to be selection factors, which oppose the use of high quality food in spring and which force the latter two species to postpone their larval development to a later time in the year. This could be caused by numerous factors like, for example, mean daytime temperature. Later in the season the larvae have to cope with the low quality of their host plants. They have, however, the advantage of large quantities of food available. A laboratory study with adults and mature larvae of O. luctuosa shows that this species can overcome low levels of protein nitrogen either by selecting younger leaves with higher nitrogen concentrations or by increasing the daily food consumption rate (RCR) on leaves with a low level of nitrogen and by a prolongation of the feeding period. In this way the larvae compensate the effect of lower daily growth rates (RGR) and a lower food conversion index (ECI) on poor food quality: Regardless of the level of protein nitrogen there was no statistically significant difference in total gain of weight during the third-instar feeding period and in the weight at the end of the third larval stage. The three investigated chrysomelids show that there exists a broad spectrum of adaptations to overcome the dilemma of variable food quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,,,,,AUG,1999,92,2,,,,,165,177,,10.1046/j.1570-7458.1999.00536.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1570-7458.1999.00536.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082645200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

P.",,,"ADDING VALUE TO FIELD-BASED AGRONOMIC RESEARCH THROUGH CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT: A CASE STUDY OF MAIZE PRODUCTION IN KITALE, KENYA",EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE,,,,,,,,,,,,"In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), rainfed agriculture is the dominant source of food production. Over the past 50 years much agronomic crop research has been undertaken, and the results of such work are used in formulating recommendations for farmers. However, since rainfall is highly variable across seasons the outcomes of such research will depend upon the rainfall characteristics of the seasons during which the work was undertaken. A major constraint that is laced by such research is die length of time for which studies could be continued, typically ranging between three and live years. This begs the question as to what extent the research was able to 'sample' the natural longer-term season-to-season rainfall variability Without knowledge of the full implications of weather variability on the performance of innovations being recommended, farmers cannot be properly advised about the possible weather-induced risks that they may face over time. To overcome this constraint, crop growth simulation models such as the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) can be used as an integral part of field-based agronomic studies. When driven) by long-term daily weather data (30+ years), such models can provide weather-induced risk estimates for a wide range of crop, soil and water management innovations for the major rainfed crops of SSA. Where access to long-term weather data is not possible, weather generators such as MarkSim can be used. This study demonstrates the value of such tools in climate risk analyses and assesses the value of the outputs in the context of a high potential maize production area in Kenya. MarkSim generated weather data is shown to provide a satisfactory approximation of recorded weather data at hand, and the output of 50 years of APSIM si 1 simulations demonstrate maize yield responses to plant population, weed control and nitrogen (N) fertilizer use that correspond well with results reported in the literature. Weather-induced risk is shown to have important effects on the rates of return ($ per $ invested) to N-fertilizer use which, across seasons and rates of N-application, ranged from 1.1 to 6.2. Similarly, rates of return to weed control and to planting at contrasting populations were also affected by seasonal variations in weather but were always so high as to not constitute a risk for small-scale 1,farmers. An analysis investigating the relative importance or temperature, radiation and water availability in contributing to weather-induced risk at different maize growth stages corresponded well with crop physiological studies reported in the literature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0014-4797,1469-4441,,,,APR,2011,47,2,,,SI,,317,338,,10.1017/S0014479710000773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0014479710000773,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000289819300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effects of black plastic mulch (BPM), silver plastic mulch (SPM), transparent plastic mulch (TPM) and bare soil on the soil temperature regime as well as on the growth and yield of rainfed soybean were evaluated in a field experiment. The results revealed a strong correlation (r(2) = 0.85) between air and soil-surface temperatures in the case of bare soil, but no correlation (r(2) = 0.03) in the case of TPM. The coloured plastic mulching raised soil temperature by 3-7 degrees C compared to bare soil, with a daily fluctuation of 6-17 degrees C at the early growth stage, while the soil temperature increased by 1-2 degrees C, with a daily fluctuation of 4-8 degrees C in later growth stages. BPM provided 1-4 degrees C more temperature than SPM and TPM at 5, 15 and 25 cm depths that augmented heat accumulation by 23% and 6% compared to bare soil and TPM, respectively. The coloured mulching significantly (p < 0.05) increased soybean growth attributes and thus augmented seed yield by 31-34% compared to bare soil. However, BPM, by maintaining the highest soil temperature, provided the highest seed yield of soybean. Therefore, BPM is recommended as a suitable mulch in the central Japan area.

There are some studies on the salinity tolerance of seagrasses under controlled laboratory conditions, but few have been done in situ. To this end, Cymodocea nodosa shoots were placed during one month at four localities: two close to a brine discharge; and the other two not affected by the discharge, and this experiment was repeated four times. The results obtained showed a decrease in growth and an increased mortality at the localities affected by the brine discharge. An increase was detected in the percentage of horizontal shoots in respect to vertical shoots at the impacted localities.

J,"Wearmouth, VJ; Sims, DW",,,,"Wearmouth, Victoria J.; Sims, David W.",,,Movement and behaviour patterns of the critically endangered common skate Dipturus batis revealed by electronic tagging,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Understanding animal distributions and habitat utilisation is vital for the management of populations, especially those of endangered species. However, this information is not available for the majority of marine species and is difficult to obtain for those with low population densities. The common skate, Dipturus batis, was once abundant and widespread in the North-East Atlantic but is now thought to be locally extinct in the Irish Sea and in the central and southern North Sea, and is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. The constraints of skate body morphology on locomotory mode assume low levels of activity with long periods spent resting on the seabed, therefore predicting a high degree of site fidelity. To investigate this hypothesis we tagged 8 common skate (two male and six female, mass range: 10.9-63.5 kg) with depth and temperature-logging data storage tags off the west coast of Scotland in May 2008. All 6 tags attached to females were recovered after 1-9 months at liberty. All 6 individuals exhibited pronounced site fidelity to highly localised areas. Within these local areas however, time-depth profiles were dominated by periods of high activity, with vertical movements of >100 m being conducted on a regular, sometimes daily, basis. Intra-individual plasticity was observed in vertical activity patterns with individuals switching between low and high activity patterns. Smaller skate were generally less active and occupied deeper depths. Limited short-term horizontal movements in preferred habitats supporting apparently high foraging activity highlights the need for spatial management of 'refugial' populations of this once widespread fish, that appears now largely extirpated from European waters.

Thermal behaviour of both single workers and groups of bees was recorded, using a video camera, in a thermal gradient system. Thermal preferences of the insects were tested seasonally in spring (May/June), summer (July/August) and autumn (September-November). Both single bees and small groups of bees changed their thermal behaviour in daily cycle. The season of the year had distinct effect on temperature preferences of both single honeybee workers or small groups of bees. In single honeybee workers the lowest ambient temperatures were preferred in late spring (the swarming phase) while the highest temperatures were selected during the summer (the colony growing phase). There were significant seasonal changes in ambient temperature selected by groups of honeybee workers. Groups of honeybee workers tended to prefer the lowest temperatures in late spring and the highest temperatures were selected during the summer. The day-night differences exhibited by small groups of bees in our experiments are likely to represent behavioural responses of the honeybee colony. In our experiments we proved an influence of the season of the year on the honeybees' thermal behaviour, which might be connected with seasonal shifts of temperature regulated by the honeybee colony.",,,,,"Grodzicki, Przemysław/H-1831-2014; Grodzicki, Przemysław/L-1188-2019; Caputa, Michał/G-6790-2014","Grodzicki, Przemysław/0000-0002-8397-8711; Grodzicki, Przemysław/0000-0002-8397-8711; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0892-7553,1572-8889,,,,NOV,2014,27,6,,,,,701,711,,10.1007/s10905-014-9460-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-014-9460-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000345080500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Relaxation manifests itself in aging processes which slow the fluctuations. Within certain approximations we are able to experimentally separate the aging dynamics from the fluctuation dynamics by introducing two time parameters, namely an aging time t(a) and a waiting time t(w). Both processes follow power laws in time. The fluctuation dynamics shows features of universality characterized by a rather uniform exponent of 1/4. These universality features were shown to be possible due to a random walk on a 1D random trajectory in conformational phase space. A very interesting aspect of protein dynamics concerns the influence of the host solvent on structural motions of the protein cores.

High temperatures adversely affect wMel, reducing Wolbachia density and cytoplasmic incompatibility in some larval habitats that experience large temperature fluctuations. We monitored the impact of a 43.6 degrees C heatwave on the wMel infection in a natural population in Cairns, Australia, where wMel was first released in 2011 and has persisted at a high frequency. Wolbachia infection frequencies in the month following the heatwave were reduced to 83% in larvae sampled directly from field habitats and 88% in eggs collected from ovitraps, but recovered to be near 100% four months later. Effects of the heatwave on wMel appeared to be stage-specific and delayed, with reduced frequencies and densities in field-collected larvae and adults reared from ovitraps but higher frequencies in field-collected adults. Laboratory experiments showed that the effects of heatwaves on cytoplasmic incompatibility and density are life stage-specific, with first instar larvae being the most vulnerable to temperature effects.

Methods This is a retrospective ecological study. Data of daily emergency hospital admissions to 15 major hospitals in HK for asthma and indices of air pollutants [sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3), particulates with an aerodynamic diameter of < 10 mu m particulate matter (PM10) and 2.5 mu m (PM2.5)] and meteorological variables from January 2000 to December 2005 were obtained from several government departments. Analysis was performed by the generalized additive models with Poisson distribution. The effects of time trend, season, other cyclical factors, temperature and humidity were adjusted. Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected. Results Altogether, 69 716 admissions were assessed. Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for asthma and levels of NO2, O-3, PM10 and PM2.5. The relative risks (RR) for hospitalization for every 10 mu g/m(3) increase in NO2, O-3, PM10 and PM2.5 were 1.028, 1.034, 1.019 and 1.021, respectively, at a lag day that ranged from cumulative lag 0-4 to 0-5. In a multi-pollutant model, O-3 was significantly associated with increased admissions for asthma. The younger age group (0-14 years) tended to have a higher RR for each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in pollutants than those aged 15-65 years. The elderly (aged >= 65 years) had a shorter 'best' lag time to develop asthma exacerbation following exposure to pollutants than those aged < 65 years.

Methods and Results: Growth of inoculated L. monocytogenes in a commercial pasteurized whole milk product was monitored at various isothermal conditions from 1.5 to 16 degrees C. The kinetic parameters of the pathogen were modelled as a function of temperature using a square root type model, which was further validated using data from 92 published growth curves from eight different milk products. Compared to four published models for L. monocytogenes growth, the model developed in this study performed better, with a per cent discrepancy and bias of 49.1 and -1.01%, respectively. The performance of the model in predicting growth at dynamic temperature conditions was evaluated at four different fluctuating temperature scenarios with periodic temperature changes from -2 to 16 degrees C. The prediction of growth at dynamic storage temperature was based on the square root model in conjunction with the differential equations of the Baranyi and Roberts model, which were numerically integrated with respect to time. The per cent relative errors between the observed and the predicted growth of L. monocytogenes were less than 10% for all temperature scenarios tested. Conclusions: Available models from experiments conducted in laboratory media may result in significant overestimation of L. monocytogenes growth in pasteurized milk because they do not take into account factors such as milk composition (e.g. natural antimicrobial compounds present in milk) and the interactions of the pathogen with the natural microflora. The product-targeted model developed in the present study showed a high performance in predicting growth of L. monocytogenes in pasteurized milk under both static and dynamic temperature conditions. Significance and Impact of the Study: Temperature fluctuations often occur during the transportation and storage of pasteurized milk.

The objective of the study was to present the data of the fluctuation of CO content as well as that of O-2, CO2, and CH4 in process gas within the waste pile, during the AB of the OFMSW. The OFMSW was aerobically biostabilized in six reactors, in which the technological regimes of AB were dependent on process duration (42-69 days), waste mass (391.02-702.38 Mg), the intensity of waste aeration (4.4-10.7 m(3).Mg-1.h(-1)), reactor design (membrane-covered reactor or membrane-covered reactor with sidewalls) and thermal conditions in the reactor (20.2-77.0 degrees C). The variations in the degree of waste aeration (O-2 content), temperature, and fluctuation of CO, CO2, and CH4 content during the weekly measurement intervals were summarized. Despite a high O-2 content in all reactors and stable thermal conditions, the presence of CO in process gas was observed, which suggests that ensuring optimum conditions for the process is not sufficient for CO emissions to be mitigated. In the analyzed experiment, CO concentration was highly variable over the duration of the process, ranging from a few to over 1,500 ppm. The highest concentration of CO was observed between the second and fifth weeks of the test. The reactor B2 was the source of the highest CO production and average highest temperature. This study suggests that the highest CO productions occur at the highest temperature, which is why the authors believe that CO production has thermochemical foundations.",,,,,"Stegenta-Dąbrowska, Sylwia/L-5304-2016; Bialowiec, Andrzej/O-4646-2014","Stegenta-Dąbrowska, Sylwia/0000-0001-7161-1878; Debowski, Marcin/0000-0002-6323-8628; Bialowiec, Andrzej/0000-0002-5871-2129",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2306-5729,,,,JUN,2020,5,2,,,,,,,40,10.3390/data5020040,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/data5020040,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000551253200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Leaves were warmed somewhat less than the target settings (1.1 & 1.5 degrees C day/night) but soil was warmed more creating an average that matched the target settings extremely well both during the day and night plus the summer and winter. The site typically has about 50% bare or litter covered soil, therefore soil heat transfer is more critical than in dense canopy ecosystems. The Wyoming site commonly has strong winds (5 ms(-1) average) and significant daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations (as much as 30 degrees C daily) but the warming system was nearly always able to maintain the set temperatures regardless of abiotic variation.

We investigated the thermal vulnerability of the tidepool shrimp, Palaemon elegans in the fastwarming southeastern Mediterranean Sea, its warm distributional edge. Tidepool organisms experience strong and fast thermal fluctuations. This might make them more resilient to change, but also bring them closer to their thermal limits during extreme conditions. To examine the shrimp's resilience, we tested three hypotheses: (1) P. elegance in the southeast Mediterranean has higher critical thermal maximum (CTMax) than in cooler regions, (2) the shrimp possess seasonal acclimatization, but (3) long exposure to extreme summer temperatures might erode its thermal performance making it vulnerable to future climate change. In a series of field observations and laboratory experiments we characterized the shrimp's thermal environment and population dynamics, determined its CTMax and tested diverse physiological performance attributes (respiration, digestion, activity, growth) under a wide range of temperatures during winter and summer. The thermal performance curves show that peak respiration rates occur at higher temperatures in the summer compared to winter, indicating seasonal acclimatization. The shrimp's CTMax was 38.1 degrees C; higher than its Atlantic counterparts, and an indication of biogeographic adaptation. However, its warming tolerance (the thermal safety margin: distance between maximum pool temperatures and CTMax) was only 0.3 degrees C, indicating low capacity for dealing with further warming in mostly isolated pools, compared to northeast Atlantic populations that have a wider safety margin. Performance also eroded with increase in exposure duration to high temperatures, and the optimum temperature reduces with time. We predict that prolonged exposure to current (similar to 32 degrees C) and future mean summer values in open water would significantly reduce its performance and increase its mortality. Further, juvenile P. elegans were found to be more vulnerable to extreme (cold and hot) temperatures than adults. Together, these findings indicate that the population viability of this robust coastal water shrimp would eventually be reduced under continuous regional warming and the intensification of extreme events.",,,,,,"Rilov, Gil/0000-0002-1334-4887",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,DEC,2021,545,,,,,,,,151641,10.1016/j.jembe.2021.151641,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2021.151641,,SEP 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000703467700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This slow growth has been widely attributed to the higher salinities and lower temperatures that typically prevail at this time of year. Recently, however, several investigators have questioned whether salinity and temperature are the primary causative factors. Some have suggested that a lack of natural productivity in the ponds during the dry season contributes to the problem, while others are considering the role of toxic algae blooms. Most farmers find that the seasonal slow growth is independent of the protein concentration or quality of the feed offered, but many farmers report that shrimp eat less during the dry season. This paper is intended as a review of published research on the problem and it also discusses the findings of several unpublished reports. Included are some of the results of a one year study conducted by the author on five shrimp farms in Guatemala. The farms are located on five different estuaries, all with slightly different environmental conditions, yet all farms experience a seasonal depression in growth and yield. It was reasoned that by comparing similarities and differences in environmental variables among farms, insights might he gained as to the cause of the slow-down. Despite near optimal salinities throughout the year on three of the five farms studied and near optimal temperatures on four of the five farms, all farms showed decreased growth rates and yields during the dry season. An analysis of the pond and supply water on the five farms showed variable nutrient levels between farms, but there appeared to be a trend toward increased total nitrogen in the supply water, as well as in production ponds, during the rainy season. While there was no apparent seasonal trend in phosphorous levels, the rainy season increase in nitrogen levels resulted in shrimp farms in Guatemala having generally higher N/P ratios during the rainy season, at a time when most farmers report higher levels of diatoms and lower levels of blue-green algae. Silica levels were not found to be limiting on any farm at any time of the year. No seasonal trend in average total bacterial counts in pond water was observed, nor was there any significant trend in populations of gram-positive spore-forming bacteria. However, there appeared to be a seasonal trend in the number of bacteria that grow on TCBS media (typically Vibrio sp.). During the dry season, a slight increase was observed in absolute numbers of TCBS bacteria and this trend became more obvious when TCBS bacteria were analyzed as a percentage of total bacteria. No such trend was observed in shrimp intestinal samples, however, and an attempt to correlate shrimp growth rates with levels of TCBS bacteria in pond water or shrimp intestine, showed no significant relationships. To test the possible effect of toxic algae on shrimp growth, a fractionization bioassay experiment was conducted during the 1994 dry season. Water from a production pond was passed through a series of canister filters to test the performance of 7 g shrimp grown for five weeks during the dry season in water with specific fractions of the water column sequentially removed, No significant differences in growth or survival were found in shrimp grown in the production pond as compared to bioassay treatments ranging from unfiltered pond water, through water that had been sequentially filtered to 10 mu m, and to 1 mu M particle sizes, plus filtration through activated carbon. These results do not support the hypothesis that toxic algae or dissolved substances contribute to dry season production problems, at least at the farm, or in the pond from which the water used in this experiment was sourced. To test the hypothesis that shrimp eat less during the dry season, two commercial sized ponds were operated through a production cycle with all of the supplementary ration presented on feeding trays. Shrimp were fed four times each day, at 7 am, 4 pm, 8 pm and 4 am, and consumption on each tray was recorded at the next feeding. Based on observations of consumption, feeding times and rates were adjusted on a daily basis. The trial indicated that during the March through May 1994 period, shrimp consumed less feed during daylight hours than would be normally recommended from a feeding table. However, if feed was offered at night, daily consumption during the dry season was not depressed, with up to 80 percent of the daily ration taken by the shrimp at night. When the rainy season started at the end of May 1994, feed consumption patterns changed, with at least half of the feed being consumed during the day. In addition, during the 1994 dry season, ponds fed at night had consistently Higher growth rates than other ponds that were fed an equivalent ration of feed, but at only two daylight feedings. These results suggest that without careful monitoring of feed consumption, seasonal changes in the feeding behavior of shrimp could contribute to the dry season production problems experienced in Central America and the Caribbean Basin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0-962-45298-X,,,,1995,,,,,,,200,213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995BH87B00019,View Full Record in Web of Science

In diversified bet-hedging, a single genotype exhibits phenotypic heterogeneity with the expectation that some individuals will survive transient selective pressures. To date, empirical evidence for bet-hedging is scarce. Here, we observe that individual Drosophila melanogaster flies exhibit striking variation in light- and temperature-preference behaviors. With a modeling approach that combines real world weather and climate data to simulate temperature preference-dependent survival and reproduction, we find that a bet-hedging strategy may underlie the observed interindividual behavioral diversity. Specifically, bet-hedging outcompetes strategies in which individual thermal preferences are heritable. Animals employing bet-hedging refrain from adapting to the coolness of spring with increased warm-seeking that inevitably becomes counterproductive in the hot summer. This strategy is particularly valuable when mean seasonal temperatures are typical, or when there is considerable fluctuation in temperature within the season. The model predicts, and we experimentally verify, that the behaviors of individual flies are not heritable. Finally, we model the effects of historical weather data, climate change, and geographic seasonal variation on the optimal strategies underlying behavioral variation between individuals, characterizing the regimes in which bet-hedging is advantageous.",,,,,,"Akhund-Zade, Jamilla/0000-0001-5589-8258",,,,,,,,,,,,,0014-3820,1558-5646,,,,DEC,2015,69,12,,,,,3171,3185,,10.1111/evo.12813,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evo.12813,,,,,,,,26531165,,,,,WOS:000368249000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fish abundance at two sites was estimated with three-pass depletion electrofishing before, during, and after peak summer temperatures. Fish movement throughout the summer was examined with radio telemetry, a two-way weir, and visible implant tags. We hypothesized that fish would emigrate or die as summer water temperatures increased beyond the 7-d upper incipient lethal temperature (LT50) of 24.2degreesC determined from laboratory experiments. However, our results suggested that fish neither emigrated from warm stream reaches nor experienced mortality, despite the presence of maximum daily water temperatures as high as 27degreesC. Furthermore, we found no evidence that fish resided in localized coolwater refuges.

Here we assessed the influence of environmental and culture variables on productivity of Cladophora coelothrix at multiple scales, firstly in an operational settlement pond and subsequently in laboratory and flow-through mesocosm experiments. Classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were used to partition the influence of key variables on growth. In situ productivity correlated primarily with nitrogen concentration, position in the pond and stocking density, with a lesser influence of salinity, temperature and the ratio of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) and total ammonium nitrogen (TAN). We subsequently evaluated the resilience of C. coelothrix in laboratory and mesocosm environments by manipulating salinity, temperature and nutrients across a broader range of values derived from a year-long survey of the settlement pond. Here temperature had the greatest influence on growth, followed by nitrogen concentration and salinity. Growth rates of C. coelothrix were high, irrespective of season, except at the extremes of each season, for example, at the lowest annual temperature and with the combination of high temperature and low salinity. Growth was also limited by similar to 20% when NO3--N and TAN were available simultaneously.

However, single-celled organisms or microscopic metazoans are often ignored in studies of secondary production, despite being very abundant and possessing high mass-specific population growth rates, relative to the more widely studied larger taxa. Here, we focused on how life history parameters scale with body size of ciliates and meiofauna (body mass range from similar to 0.001 to 90 mg C/individual) and integrated experimental and survey data to calculate secondary production of these groups. First, we derived a single allometric scaling relationship between the intrinsic rate of population increase and body mass in a laboratory experiment. We then used this relationship to calculate secondary production for over 260 of these small species in the field, using survey data from two contrasting streams; one of which was nutrient rich, the other nutrient poor. Results from laboratory cultures showed that the scaling relationship between body mass and both daily intrinsic rate of population increase and generation time followed a power law. The relationship between body mass and annual secondary production was consistent in both streams, but the number of taxa was greater in the more productive site. Both ciliates and meiofauna had high rates of biomass production, with annual P/B ratios (production divided by biomass) for the whole assemblage exceeding 11 in both streams.

Thermal sensors was used on the test building in order to determine the indoor and outdoor air temperature as well as the surface temperature of the walls. The results show that the location of wall layers influences the indoor climate. When CEBs layer is placed inside, it leads to the highest reduction of the indoor temperature fluctuations. When CEBs layer is placed outside, it presents the best opportunity to prevent overheating in building spaces mainly occupied at night. Regardless of the wall design, nocturnal ventilation is the most suitable strategy which leads to improving the indoor climate compared to continuous ventilation.

The PMW SO record was validated against in situ snow depth observations and showed favorable accuracy (0.66-0.92 mean correlations; 2-10 day mean absolute errors) for the major climate regions of Alaska. The PMW SO results were also within 10 days of finer spatial scale SO observational records, including Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), MODIS, and Landsat, for a majority (75%) of Alaska. However, the PMW record showed a general SO delay at higher elevations and across the Alaska North Slope, and earlier SO in the Alaska interior and southwest regions relative to the other SO records. Overall, we assign an uncertainty +/-11 days to the PMW SO. The PMW SO record benefits from the near-daily temporal fidelity of underlying brightness temperature (Tb) observations and reveals a mean regional trend in earlier SO timing (-0.39 days yr(-1)), while significant (p < 0.1) SO trend areas encompassed 11% of the Alaska domain and ranged from -0.11 days yr(-1) to -1.31 days yr(-1) over the 29-year satellite record. The observed SO dates also showed anomalous early SO dates during markedly warm years. Our results clarify the pattern and rate of SO changes across Alaska, which are interactive with global warming and contributing to widespread permafrost degradation, changes in regional hydrology, ecosystems, and associated services.

Among these, marine heatwaves can pose significant threats to marine organisms. Yet, experimental studies that include fluctuating thermal stress are rare, and if available often fail to base experimental treatments on available long-term environmental data. We evaluated 22-year high-resolution sea surface temperature data on the occurrence of heatwaves and cold-spells in a temperate coastal marine environment. The absence of a general warming trend in the data may in parts be responsible for a lack of changes in heatwave occurrences (frequency) and their traits (intensity, duration, and rate of change) over time. Yet, the retrieved traits for present-day heatwaves ensured most-natural treatment scenarios, enabling an experimental examination of the impacts of marine heatwaves and phases of recovery on an important temperate predator, the common sea star Asterias rubens. In a 68-days long experiment, we compared a 37- and a 28-days long heatwave with a treatment that consisted of three consecutive 12-days long heatwaves with 4 days of recovery in between. The heatwaves had an intensity of 4.6 degrees C above climatological records, resulting in a maximum temperature of 23.25 degrees C. We demonstrate that heatwaves decrease feeding and activity of A. rubens, with longer heatwaves having a more severe and lasting impact on overall feeding pressure (up to 99.7% decrease in feeding rate) and growth (up to 87% reduction in growth rate). Furthermore, heatwaves of similar overall mean temperature, but interrupted, had a minor impact compared to continuous heatwaves, and the impact diminished with repeated heatwave events. We experimentally demonstrated that mild heatwaves of today's strength decrease the performance of A. rubens. However, this echinoderm may use naturally occurring short interruptions of thermal stress as recovery to persist in a changing and variable ocean. Thus, our results emphasize the significance of thermal fluctuations and especially, the succession and timing of heat-stress events.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,FEB 24,2022,8,,,,,,,,790241,10.3389/fmars.2021.790241,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.790241,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000766964700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the focus was to use continuous sampling of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) concentration, paired with discrete grab samples of water which were analyzed for total nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen species to (1) assess if rice paddies are a source of nitrogen loading to downstream systems; (2) monitor the diel cycles in NO3--N of rice paddies and TWR; and (3) describe the nitrogen capture capacity of TWR during these events. Five rice paddies within the Mississippi Delta with adjoining TWR were selected as case study locations. Both paddy and TWR were instrumented to continuously monitor nitrate, pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity, and water temperature; discrete grab samples of water were also taken at deployment and collection. During the study, most TWR had total nitrogen concentrations <1 mg L-1; the majority of nitrogen present at drain was organic (>51% for paddies, and >88% for TWR). The percent change in total nitrogen concentrations between draining paddies and post-drain TWR ranged from 14 to +178%; the percent of organic nitrogen increased between 5 and 24% in TWR following rice drains. Both nitrogen accumulation and dilution in TWR were observed during drain events. Diel cycles were apparent and were in phase with dissolved oxygen (average values between 3.7 and 13.2 mg L-1). The average peak to-peak amplitude in TWR was 0.101 mg NO3--N L-1. Total nitrogen captured by TWR ranged from 0.009 to 0.610 kg ha(-1). Increases in NO3--N concentrations were observed in several TWR during drain events, but concentrations remained low and loads were determined to be of little consequence; this suggests limited detrimental impact of rice drains downstream.

This review addresses the effects of freeze-thaw cycles on soil physical properties, microorganisms, carbon and nutrient dynamics. trace gas losses and higher organisms associated with soil. I discuss how the controlled manipulation of freeze-thaw cycles has varied widely among studies and propose that, despite their value in demonstrating the mechanisms of freeze-thaw action in soils, many studies of soil freeze-thaw cycles have used cycle amplitudes, freezing rates and minimum temperatures that are not relevant to temperature changes across much of the soil profile in situ. The lack of coordination between the timing of soil collection and the season for which freeze-thaw cycles are being simulated is also discussed. Suggested improvements to future studies of soil freeze-thaw cycles include the maintenance of realistic temperature fluctuations across the soil profile, soil collection in the appropriate season and the inclusion of relevant surface factors such as plant litter in the fall or excess water in the spring. The implications of climate change for soil freeze-thaw cycles are addressed, along with the need to directly assess how changes in soil freeze-thaw cycle dynamics alter primary production.

Many studies have used the energy balance method to model greenhouse environments and calculate the rates of ventilation needed to control them. However, the efficacy of this method is influenced by many factors. There are often many parameters in the energy balance model, related to the greenhouse structure, crop growth, and climate. Thus, the effectiveness and applicability of greenhouse ventilation systems based on energy balance can be compromised. Here, we study a hierarchical fuzzy control method and use simple fuzzy logic controllers to control the coordination and opening angles of a new energy-saving solar greenhouse roof and sidewall ventilation. This design reduces the complexity of the fuzzy rule base and the fuzzy subsystem related to the physical model, therefore making it easy to design and build. The system uses the fuzzy tool in the Matlab environment, enabling a quick design, and the fuzzy inference engine fis.c file (Fuzzy Inference System) to load the design results into the fuzzy control system, thus making the modification and maintenance of the system easier. The experimental data showed that the new hierarchical fuzzy control reduced temperature fluctuations and maintained temperature closer to desired temperature than a non-fuzzy control method.

In 1989 browntail moth resurged in Maine, with periodic, moderate outbreaks before a dramatic increase of the population occurred in 2016. We examined the pattern of annual defoliation by browntail moth since its resurgence in the 1990s as well as variation in populations throughout infested areas in Maine during three years of the recent outbreak, 2016-2018, relative to differences in weather, parasitism and habitat characteristics. Levels of defoliation over 24 yr were predicted by the preceding spring precipitation (-, negative effect) and the year's previous late summer and early fall temperatures (+, positive effect) when first to third instar larvae feed and then construct winter hibernacula. Late summer temperatures predicted the abundance of hibernacula across outbreak areas (+1. Early spring temperatures (+) and early and late spring precipitation (-) predicted early summer larval and pupal nest abundance. Warmer fall temperatures result in more mature populations coming out of winter hibernacula in the spring, whereas spring precipitation drives epizootic outbreaks of Entomophaga aulicae (Reichardt in Bail) Humber (Entomophthorales: Entomophthoraceae). with parasitoids playing a lesser role.

Increased assimilate availability was obtained by higher light intensity, higher CO2 concentration, lower plant density or longer duration of the long-day (LD) period. Within each experiment, conditions that were expected to increase assimilate availability indeed resulted in higher total dry mass of the plant, excluding roots (TDMp). In contrast, flower mass ratio was hardly affected, except for the increased duration of the LD period that significantly reduced the partitioning towards the flowers. Consequently, an increase in total flower dry mass with assimilate availability was observed and this was mainly a result of higher numbers of flowers per plant, including flower buds (NoF). Individual flower size was only influenced by assimilate availability when average daily incident PAR during short-day period was lower than 7.5 mol m(-2) d(-1), resulting in lighter and smaller flowers. Excluding the positive linear effect of the duration of the LD period, assimilate availability hardly influenced plant height (<10% increase). It is concluded that within a wide range of growth conditions chrysanthemum invests additional assimilates, diverted to the generative organs, in increasing NoF rather than in increasing flower size. Irrespective of the growth conditions and season a positive linear relationship (r(2) = 0.90) between NoF and TDMp was observed. This relationship was cultivar-specific.

In such extreme habitats, behavioural responses to environmental changes are key to survival, driving differential performance. We investigated sponging behaviour (water uptake from sediments) of the deposit-feeding crab, Scopimera intermedia, on tropical sandy shores to determine its thermoregulatory function. The thermal physiology of the crabs and their habitat conditions were quantified by measuring thermal performance curves and recording environmental temperatures during the crabs' activity periods. Environmental temperatures were combined with experimental data to investigate the role of sponging on the thermal performances of the crabs by simulating field body temperatures. Sponging rate was strongly and positively correlated with feeding rate, as sponging replenishes water for flotation feeding. Sponging, however, also reduced body temperatures on average by 1.3 degrees C. Simulated populations of crabs which were unable to sponge had more variable body temperatures, which exceeded the critical thermal maximum of the crabs (39 degrees C) nearly 2000 times more often than crabs able to sponge. Sponging is, therefore, a multifunctional behavioural trait important for both feeding and thermoregulation. The evolution of such multifunctional traits is likely to be a widespread, but overlooked phenomenon in intertidal species, as maintaining a functional body temperature is energetically costly in habitats where environmental conditions fluctuate strongly such as on tropical shores.",,,,,,"Hui, Tin Yan/0000-0002-7990-8323",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,JAN,2019,189,1,,,,,79,89,,10.1007/s00442-018-4299-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4299-8,,,,,,,,30421005,,,,,WOS:000455167600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The focus of this study was the growth, yield, and fruit quality response of sweet cherry to water and soil management over three successive fruiting seasons, 2009-11, in a cold climate production area. The final 2 years of the study period were characterized by cool, wet springs resulting in low yield and yield efficiency across all treatments. Soil moisture content (0- to 20-cm depth) during the growing season was often higher in soils that received high-frequency irrigation (HFI) compared with low-frequency irrigation (LFI). HFI and LFI received the same amount of water, but water was applied four times daily in the HFI treatment but every other day in the LFI treatment. Consequently, larger trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) and higher yield were found on HFI compared with LFI trees. Soil management strategies involving annual bloom time phosphorus (P) fertigation and wood waste mulching did not affect tree vigor and yield. Increased soluble solids concentration (SSC) occurred with LFI. Decreased SSC occurred with delayed harvest maturity in trees receiving P fertigation at bloom.

Thereby zooplankton reduces predation by fish by staying in deep and dark colder strata during daytime and migrating into warmer layers during night, and thus experiences diel alterations in temperature. Constantly lower temperatures have been shown to increase the relative abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in Daphnia sp. Furthermore, a low dietary supply of the omega 3-PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) has been shown to limit the induction of DVM in Daphnia magna and the performance of D. magna under fluctuating temperatures, as experienced during DVM. In nature DVM of D. magna in response to fish is accompanied by the presence of fish-borne kairomone and diel fluctuations of depth dependent-parameters like temperature, food, and oxygen supply. Here we investigated the effect of factors, which are differing between Daphnia that perform DVM and those which do not. We selected to examine the effect of changing temperature and light conditions and of the presence/absence of fish kairomones on D. magna. For this purpose, we conducted a full factorial experimental design in which we grew D. magna under constantly warm temperatures in a diel light-dark regime or under alternating temperatures in darkness crossed with the presence or absence of fish kairomones. We analyzed the fatty acid composition of mature animals and of their offspring in each treatment. Simulation of the light and temperature regime of migrating animals in presence of the fish kairomone resulted in an increased relative allocation of the omega 3-PUFA EPA, from adult animals to their offspring, manifesting as decreased EPA concentrations in mothers and increased EPA concentrations in their offspring in response to simulated DVM (mothers). Additionally, EPA concentrations in the offspring were affected by the interaction of simulated DVM and the fish cue. The presence of the fish kairomone alone increased the EPA concentration in the offspring, that was not experiencing simulated DVM. These findings lead to the conclusion that the temperature and light regime associated with DVM alone, as well as in combination with the DVM-inducing fish kairomones, alter the allocation of fatty acids to the offspring in a manner, which is beneficial for the offspring under the decreased average temperatures, which migrating animals are exposed to. A low dietary supply of omega 3-PUFAs may constrain D. magna's amplitude of DVM, but our results suggest that the next generation of animals may be capable of regaining the full DVM amplitude due to the effect of the fish kairomone and the experienced temperature fluctuations (and darkness) on tissue fatty acid composition. These findings suggest that fatty acid limitation in DVM performing Daphnia may be more severe for the maternal than for the offspring generation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,APR 17,2020,8,,,,,,,,e8809,10.7717/peerj.8809,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8809,,,,,,,,32337097,,,,,WOS:000526522100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wastewater sludge was sampled at a pig slaughterhouse 24 h before each composting experiment, and mixtures were made at the same mass ratio. Six composting experiments were performed in a lab reactor (300 L) under forced aeration. Aeration flow was constant throughout the experiment and aeration rates applied ranged between 1.69 and 16.63 L/h/kg DM of mixture. Material temperature and oxygen consumption were monitored continuously. Nitrogen losses in leachates as organic and total ammoniacal nitrogen, nitrite and nitrate, and losses in exhaust gases as ammonia were measured daily. Concentrations of total carbon and nitrogen i.e., organic nitrogen, total ammoniacal nitrogen, and nitrite and nitrate were measured in the initial substrates and in the composted materials. The results showed that organic nitrogen, which was released as NH4+/NH3 by ammonification, was closely correlated to the ratio of carbon removed from the material to TC/N-org of the initial substrates. The increase of aeration was responsible for the increase in ammonia emissions and for the decrease in nitrogen losses through leaching. At high aeration rates, losses of nitrogen in leachates and as ammonia in exhaust gases accounted for 90-99% of the nitrogen removed from the material. At low aeration rates, those accounted for 47-85% of the nitrogen removed from the material. The highest concentrations of total ammoniacal nitrogen in composts occurred at the lowest aeration rate. Due to the correlation of ammonification with biodegradation and to the measurements of losses in leachates and in exhaust gases, the pool NH4+/NH3 in the composting material was calculated as a function of time. The nitrification rate was found to be proportional to the Mean content of NH4+/NH3 in the material, i.e., initial NH4+/NH3 plus NH4+/NH3 released by ammonification minus losses in leachates and in exhaust gases. The aeration rate was shown to be a main parameter affecting nitrogen dynamics during composting since it controlled the ammonification, the ammonia emission and the nitrification processes.

Cobia ceased to eat at 0.62 (0.56-0.70) ppm NH3-N and 76.1 (73.2-79.0) ppm NO2-N. Swimming behavior was affected at higher concentrations: 0.80 (0.74-0.85) ppm NH3-N and 88.8 (82.6-95.5) ppm NO2-N. Even higher concentrations were necessary to kill juvenile cobia, LC50-96 h for ammonia was estimated at 1.13 (1.06-1.19) ppm NH3-N, and within the range of concentrations tested for nitrite it was not possible to estimate the LC50-96 h, as only 30% of the individuals died at the highest concentration after 96 h (210 ppm NO2-N). The results of the present experiments demonstrate that ammonia could be problematic at relatively low levels for the intensive rearing of juvenile cobia; however, it is unlikely that the high levels of nitrite needed to harm juvenile cobia would be reached in a well designed and properly operating RAS.

For this purpose, a thermally insulated annular basin with water flow induced by a propeller was used. The water was cooled by a mixture of small pieces of ice and sodium chloride, placed in the central separated part of the basin. The results obtained show that the extent of supercooling and the time until the onset of crystal formation are strongly dependent on the cooling rate. The probable causes of this dependence are discussed. In a different set of experiments, the formation mechanisms of active frazil and anchor ice were investigated. Such ice types were observed when the total mass of water remained in a supercooled state after crystallization. In these cases, the amount of supercooling did not exceed several hundredths degree centigrade, which also explains ice formation on the propeller and other objects placed in the flow. Measurements of water temperature in the thin contact layer on the surface of these objects showed oscillatory temperature fluctuations in the range of several thousandths degree centigrade. This phenomenon is caused by the dissipation of kinetic energy and its transformation into thermal energy. Thus during these rapid temperature oscillations, the cooling phase and the rate of cooling play an important role for the onset of crystal formation and may be one of the mechanisms of anchor ice formation, as this first set of experiments on supercooled water has shown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,90-5410-972-6,,,,1998,,,,,,,371,378,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000076720100054,View Full Record in Web of Science

During the experimental period (from weaning to 2.2 kg body weight) weekly individual live weight, cage feed intake, incidence of diarrhoea, ringworm, and injured rabbit data was recorded. The maximum temperature-humidity index ranged from 31 to 35, and so indicating severe heat stress. At the end of the experimental period 10, 20, 30 and 30 rabbits under densities of 6, 12, 18 and 24 rabbits/m2, respectively, were slaughtered and carcass performance recorded. Average daily gain and feed intake from weaning to the end of the experimental period decreased by 0.31 +/- 0.070 and 1.20 +/- 0.25 g, respectively, for each unit that the density increased at the beginning of the experiment (P=0.001). The length of the fattening period increased by 0.91 +/- 0.16 d (P=0.001) for each unit of increment of density. However, rabbit production (expressed in kg/m(2)) increased linearly and quadratically with density (P<0.008). Cage density did not affect feed efficiency, which on average was 0.214 g/g (P=0.37). Animals housed at the highest density, compared to the average of those caged at lower densities, tended to show higher incidence of ringworm (68.9 vs 39.4%; P=0.075) and injury (16.8 vs 3.03%; P=0.12), and showed higher mortality (20.5 vs 9.63%; P=0.043). Density did not alter the dressing out percentage nor chilled carcass weight. The proportion of scapular fat (P=0.042) increased linearly with increasing levels of density, but perirrenal fat was unaffected (P=0.22). Increasing density reduced dorsal length linearly (P=0.001), and reduced drip loss percentage linearly and quadratically (P=0.097 and 0.018, respectively).

Here, we use transfer entropy (TE), which measures information flow between variables, to identify dominant drivers of discharge and their timescales using sensor data from the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed, ID, USA. Consistent with previous mechanistic studies, TE revealed that snowpack accumulation and partitioning into melt, recharge, and evaporative loss dominated discharge patterns and that snow-sourced baseflow reduced the greatest amount of uncertainty in discharge. We hypothesized that machine learning models (MLMs) specified in accordance with the dominant lag timescales, identified via TE, would outperform timescale-agnostic models. However, while lagged-variable random forest regressions captured the dominant process-seasonal snowmelt-they ultimately did not perform as well as the unlagged models, provided those models were specified with input data aggregated over a range of timescales. Unlagged models, not constrained by timescales of the dominant processes, more effectively represented variable interactions (e.g., rain-on-snow events) playing a critical role in translating precipitation into streamflow over long, intermediate, and short timescales. Meanwhile, long short-term memory (LSTM) models were effective in internally identifying the key lag and aggregation scales for predicting discharge. Parsimonious specification of LSTM models, using only daily unlagged precipitation and temperature data, produced the highest performing predictions. Our findings suggest that TE can identify dominant streamflow controls and the relative importance of different mechanisms of streamflow generation, useful for establishing process baselines and fingerprinting watersheds. However, restricting MLMs based on dominant timescales undercuts their skill at learning these timescales internally. Plain Language Summary Hydrologic forecast models play an important role in predicting flooding or water scarcity. However, uncertainty in model inputs such as the spatial distribution of precipitation or the amount of underground water storage all reduce the accuracy of discharge forecasts. One way to simplify the complex processes that affect riverflows is to quantify hydrologic response times and ensure these timescales are represented in hydrologic models. Here, we used techniques from information theory to identify important drivers of riverflows and quantify response times between water inputs and riverflows. Based on the dominant timescales identified, we formulated informed models to forecast riverflows but found that the informed models outperformed baseline models only for a limited set of conditions. Rather, specialized machine learning models that learn a spectrum of response times between predictors and riverflow, representing timescales of both dominant and subordinate processes affecting riverflow, achieved the best predictive performance. Moreover, the models performed well using only precipitation and temperature data-both widely available-as inputs. This finding suggested that these models could perform well for forecasting streamflow in both gauged and ungauged basins.",,,,,,"Zhang, Liang/0000-0002-6111-5640; /0000-0002-6701-7507; Ma, Hongxu/0000-0003-0411-5895; Moges, Edom/0000-0003-4559-0799",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,AUG,2020,56,8,,,,,,,e2019WR024908,10.1029/2019WR024908,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019WR024908,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000582701700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to frequent seasonal drought during the canola growing season, irrigation plays a vital role in improving canola yields. However, the impact of irrigation and climate variations on canola yield and the yield gap (the difference between potential and rainfed yield) has not been properly addressed. Existing experimental data are limited and are not sufficient to answer these questions. A modelling study is therefore warranted to extend the experimental findings. In this study, we used a modeling approach to quantify the yield potential and the yield gap of canola crop, how they are affected by inter-annual climate variability, and how much water is required for irrigation to close the yield gap in southwest China. The APSIM-Canola model was firstly calibrated and validated against experimental data at Yuxi site in SWC from 1981 to 1989. The model was then used to simulate the canola yield under irrigation and rainfed conditions from 1961 to 2010. The simulation results were used to explore the impact of different irrigation scenarios on canola yield. From 1961 to 2010, minimum temperature increased by 0.5 degrees C per decade (p < 0.01) during the canola growing season, whereas daily global radiation decreased by 0.3 MJ m(-2) per decade (p < 0.01). Growing season precipitation ranged from 44.3 to 310.9 mm with a non-significant decreasing trend. The warming and dimming trend from 1961 to 2010 was estimated to reduce the potential yield at the rate of 151 kg ha(-1) per decade (p < 0.01), mainly due to reduced radiation and length of growing period. Simulation results with a single hybrid cultivar showed that the potential canola yield under fully irrigation (3452kg ha(-1)) is about three times the rainfed yield (1215 kg ha(-1)). Improved irrigation increases yield and water productivity, particularly in dry seasons. To achieve similar to 80% of the potential yield, an average amount of 330.1 mm, 302.9 mm, and 265.2 mm irrigation water, were required for canola in wet, medium, and dry seasons, respectively. Longer season canola cultivars may help to mitigate the negative impact of further climate warming in the future.",,,,,"Wang, Enli/K-7478-2012; He, Di/E-2904-2018; Wang, Jing/AFK-1683-2022","Wang, Enli/0000-0002-6653-5791; He, Di/0000-0002-0049-5125; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-0-9872143-5-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,389,395,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000410535400053,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ocean warming and acidification will alter rates of benthic reef metabolism (i.a, primary production, respiration, calcification, and CaCO3 dissolution), but our understanding of community and ecosystem level responses is limited in terms of functional, spatial, and temporal scales. Furthermore, dramatic changes in coral cover and benthic metabolism could alter seawater carbonate chemistry on coral reefs, locally alleviating or exacerbating OA. This study examines how benthic metabolic rates scale with changing coral cover (0-100%), and the subsequent influence of these coral communities on seawater carbonate chemistry based on mesocosm experiments in Bermuda and Hawaii. In Bermuda, no significant differences in benthic metabolism or seawater carbonate chemistry were observed for low (40%) and high (80%) coral cover due to large variability within treatments. In contrast, significant differences were detected between treatments in Hawaii with benthic metabolic rates increasing with increasing coral cover. Observed increases in daily net community calcification and nighttime net respiration scaled proportionally with coral cover. This was not true for daytime net community organic carbon production rates, which increased the most between 0 and 20% coral cover and then less so between 20 and 100%. Consequently, diel variability in seawater carbonate chemistry increased with increasing coral cover, but absolute values of pH, Omega(a), and pCO(2) were not significantly different during daytime. To place the results of the mesocosm experiments into a broader context, in situ seawater carbon dioxide (CO2) at three reef sites in Bermuda and Hawaii were also evaluated; reefs with higher coral cover experienced a greater range of diel CO2 levels, complementing the mesocosm results. The results from this study highlight the need to consider the natural complexity of reefs and additional biological and physical factors that influence seawater carbonate chemistry on larger spatial and longer temporal scales. Coordinated efforts combining various research approaches (e.g., experiments, field studies, and models) will be required to better understand how benthic metabolism integrates across functional, spatial, and temporal scales, and for making predictions on how coral reefs will respond to climate change.",,,,,"Page, Heather/AAP-4668-2021","Page, Heather/0000-0001-9997-0004",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,,2017,4,,,,,,,,161,10.3389/fmars.2017.00161,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00161,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000457690600161,View Full Record in Web of Science

This was the first finding of E. similaris, an american species, in Europe and in the EPPO region. By contrast to E. tuberis, a well studied species, no information exists on the biology, behavior, host-range and population dynamics of E. similaris to base adequate and efficient control strategies. Because of the subterranean development of the larvae, the small size and high mobility of the adults, the field studies necessary to collect data on the population dynamics and damage, for determining the most adequate timing and control strategies are difficult to carry-out with natural populations. To circumvent this constraint we developed at INIAV a rearing technique for producing adult insects of the species E. similaris for the artificial infestation of laboratory and field experiments. The insects are reared inside cages kept in a walk-in climate-controlled chamber (temperature 22 +/- 0.5 degrees C, 16h day-length, and 64%-84% relative humidity). As host-plants, juvenile potted plants of aubergine (Solanum melongena L.) and small potted plants of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) are used. The host plants are produced in a separate chamber, and later introduced in the insect rearing unit to be exposed to adult insects during three weeks, for oviposition to occur. After this period, the plants are cleaned off from adults, removed from the oviposition cage and transferred to smaller emergence cages, where the immature stages present in the soil are allowed to complete their development. Each pot is kept 5-7 weeks in the emergence cage. The adults are daily collected with entomological mouth aspirators, and either used for the experiments or reintroduced into the production cycle. The cultures are refreshed twice per year with insects collected from the field, in order to preserve a large genetic base in the insect cultures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-84-695-9055-3,,,,2014,,,,,,,1849,1854,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000376620800315,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ecophysiological traits were followed through six years for the C3 bunch grass Festuca vaginata, the spreading C4 grass Cynodon dactylon and shrub-sized root suckers of Populus alba. In general, experimental treatments had slighter effects than weather fluctuations yielding extremities did. Populus alba responded to nocturnal warming with developing slenderer leaves. Rain exclusion reduced leaf physiological activity or growth, but only during or just after the treatment, and in certain years. When assessing treatment and background climatic variation effects together, in spring, leaf area growth was consistently stimulated by increasing temperature, but decreased with longer rainless periods for P. alba and F. vaginata. Physiological responses in spring indicated low temperature limitation for C. dactylon, and both low and high temperature control for P. alba. Longer summer droughts reduced leaf gas exchange, particularly for F. vaginata with substantial drop in photochemical activity and chlorophyll content. These results suggest that shallow rooted C3 bunch grasses can be the most susceptible to climatic variation, thus their abundance is expected to decline in the Pannonian forest-steppe. In contrast, plants having deeper roots and clonal integration will probably be less affected by the projected warming and drying climate. C4 photosynthesis or southern geographical distribution may also be beneficial, thus, the abundance of such species is expected to diminish less or even increase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3088,1336-9563,,,,DEC,2017,72,12,,,,,1431,1445,,10.1515/biolog-2017-0163,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2017-0163,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000422841900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Plants were inoculated with M. enterolobii (5,000 eggs/plant) and arranged in a completely randomized design in a greenhouse with an average daily temperature of 24.8 degrees C. Galls and egg masses per root system (0-5 scale), eggs per egg mass, eggs per gram of fresh root (gfr), and reproduction factor (RF) were determined. Meloidogyne enterolobii infected and reproduced on all the sweetpotato cultivars. The nematode induced galls on both fibrous and storage roots, regardless of the cultivar, as well as induced necrosis and cracks on storage roots. The lesions and cracks on the storage roots were more visually pronounced on Hernandez than those on other cultivars. Cultivar Orleans sustained less root galling and egg masses than other cultivars (p <= 0.01), and both Orleans and Beauregard cultivars had less eggs per gfr and a lower RF than Covington (5,683 eggs/gfr; RF =16.92), Evangeline (7,161 eggs/gfr; RF =30.01), and Hernandez (6,979 eggs/gfr; RF =22.6). The latter two cultivars sustained the largest amount of reproduction of M. enterolobii. The number of eggs per egg mass ranged from 462 to 503 and was similar among all cultivars. In summary, M. enterolobii reproduced well on all sweetpotato cultivars; however, differences were observed among cultivars (p <= 0.001).

Here, we study the impact of dynamic versus climatological soil moisture in the GISS GCM ModelE (with prescribed sea-surface temperatures) on the variance and on the spatial and temporal correlation scale of hydrologically relevant climate variables (evaporation, precipitation, temperature, cloud cover) over the land surface. We also confirm that synoptic variations in soil moisture have a substantial impact on the mean climate state, because of the nonlinearity of the dependence of evapotranspiration on soil moisture. We find that including dynamic soil moisture increases the interannual variability of seasonal (summer and fall) and annual temperature, precipitation, and cloudiness. Dynamic soil moisture tends to decrease the correlation length scale of seasonal (warm-season) to annual land temperature fluctuations and increase that of precipitation. Dynamic soil moisture increases the persistence of temperature anomalies from spring to summer and from summer to fall, and makes the correlation between land precipitation and temperature fluctuations substantially more negative.

The WRGR alone explained 63% of the variation in LRGR. However, the slope (beta(1)) of the LRGR-WRGR relationship varied with white crappie W-r and body weight; beta(1) increased exponentially with W-r and declined as a power function of weight. A multiple-regression (MR) model that predicted LRGR from WRGR, W-r, and fish weight was constructed (R-2 = 0.77; P < 0.0001) and combined with an existing white crappie bioenergetics model (BEM) that was originally capable of predicting growth in terms of weight only. Output from the BEM provided input to the MR model in each modeling time step. Independent evaluations showed that the combined BEM-MR model accurately predicted the observed trajectories of white crappie growth in length (+/- 2.1%) and W-r (+/- 4.1 units) from daily predictions of fish weight and length over 60-d periods. The combined BEM-MR model was initiated with a fish's day-1 observed weight, length, and W-r values and was run continuously (without resetting values) for full-experiment durations by use of previous-day outputs as inputs for next-day predictions. The demonstrated capacity to adapt an existing BEM to accurately simulate a fish species' growth in length and change in condition, in addition to growth in weight, is expected to substantially expand the scope of application of BEMs in fisheries management and aquatic ecology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8487,,,,,MAY,2006,135,3,,,,,695,710,,10.1577/T05-006.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-006.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000238676600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Production, metabolism, and aspects of circulating somatotropin",JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Heat stress is detrimental to dairy production and affects numerous variables including feed intake and milk production. It is unclear, however, whether decreased milk yield is primarily due to the associated reduction in feed intake or the cumulative effects of heat stress on feed intake, metabolism, and physiology of dairy cattle. To distinguish between direct (not mediated by feed intake) and indirect (mediated by feed intake) effects of heat stress on physiological and metabolic indices, Holstein cows (n = 6) housed in thermal neutral conditions were pair-fed (PF) to match the nutrient intake of heat-stressed cows (HS; n = 6). All cows were subjected to 2 experimental periods: 1) thermal neutral and ad libitum intake for 9 d (P1) and 2) HS or PF for 9 d (P2). Heat-stress conditions were cyclical with daily temperatures ranging from 29.7 to 39.2 degrees C. During P1 and P2 all cows received i.v. challenges of epinephrine (d 6 of each period), and growth hormone releasing factor (GRF; d 7 of each period), and had circulating somatotropin (ST) profiles characterized (every 15 min for 6 h on d 8 of each period). During P2, HS cows were hyperthermic for the entire day and peak differences in rectal temperatures and respiration rates occurred in the afternoon (38.7 to 40.2 degrees C and 46 to 82 breaths/min, respectively). Heat stress decreased dry matter intake by greater than 35% and, by design, PF cows had similar reduced intakes. Heat stress and PF decreased milk yield, although the pattern and magnitude (40 and 21%, respectively) differed between treatments. The reduction in dry matter intake caused by HS accounted for only approximately 35% of the decrease in milk production. Both HS and PF cows entered into negative energy balance, but only PF cows had increased (approximately 120%) basal nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations. Both PF and HS cows had decreased (7%) plasma glucose levels. The NEFA response to epinephrine did not differ between treatments but was increased ( greater than 50%) in all cows during P2. During P2, HS (but not PF) cows had a modest reduction (16%) in plasma insulin-like growth factor-I. Neither treatment nor period had an effect on the ST response to GRF and there was little or no treatment effect on mean ST levels or pulsatility characteristics, but both HS and PF cows had reduced mean ST concentrations during P2. In summary, reduced nutrient intake accounted for just 35% of the HS-induced decrease in milk yield, and modest changes in the somatotropic axis may have contributed to a portion of the remainder. Differences in basal NEFA between PF and HS cows suggest a shift in postabsorptive metabolism and nutrient partitioning that may explain the additional reduction in milk yield in cows experiencing a thermal load.",,,,,"Baumgard, Lance Hall/AAZ-7090-2021; Rhoads, Robert P/F-2861-2016","Rhoads, Robert P/0000-0002-5205-5834; Rhoads, Michelle/0000-0003-4652-6430",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0302,1525-3198,,,,MAY,2009,92,5,,,,,1986,1997,,10.3168/jds.2008-1641,http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2008-1641,,,,,,,,19389956,,,,,WOS:000265449700017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The average time any solution may remain supercooled is determined only by the degree of supercooling and heterogeneous nucleation sites it encounters. Here we summarize the many and varied definitions of the so-called supercooling point, also called the temperature of crystallization and the nucleation temperature, and exhibit the natural, inherent width associated with this quantity. We describe a new method for accurate determination of the supercooling point, which takes into account the inherent statistical fluctuations of the value. We show further that many measurements on a single unchanging sample are required to make a statistically valid measure of the supercooling point. This raises an interesting difference in circumstances where such repeat measurements are inconvenient, or impossible, for example for live organism experiments. We also discuss the effect of solutes on this temperature of nucleation. Existing data appear to show that various solute species decrease the nucleation temperature somewhat more than the equivalent melting point depression. For non-ionic solutes the species appears not to be a significant factor whereas for ions the species does affect the level of decrease of the nucleation temperature. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

However, water level requirements (WLRs) of these plants are not well studied. In the present study, we conducted a systematic assessment of WLRs of Carex cinerascens regarding to each life history stage, based on field investigations and a series of simulation experiments in the Yangtze River floodplain. Results showed that C. cinerascens was well developed in lakes with intermittent water level fluctuations. Its rhizomes could not emerge underwater or in water-saturated conditions, and the optimum soil moisture for emergence was 15-30% with air temperature above 6 degrees C. Its growth was prohibited when the whole plant was inundated (i.e. inundation depth > plant height), and when rate of water level change exceeded 1.2 cm/d. Although summer inundation was not essential for C. cinerascens development, it was beneficial to the plant for excluding competitive species. The timing of habitat inundation was suggested to be after May when the plant matured. The timing of rhizome emergence in the second growing season was determined by when the habitat was exposed. With inclusion of temperature limits, the optimum timing of habitat exposure in autumn was October, and the duration of summer inundation was therefore 0-150 days. We finally combined WLRs of each life history stage and established an integrated WLRs model of C. cinerascens in Yangtze floodplain lakes. It is the first time that such a WLRs model was proposed for hygrophytes in lakes. Moreover, we presented a methodology for assessment of WLRs of hygrophytes which can be widely used in riverine lakes as well as other wetlands.

The experimental kinetic data were fitted to the Baranyi model, and growth parameters, such as maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)), maximum population density (N-max), and lag time (lambda), were estimated. As a result of estimating these parameters, we found that L. monocytogenes can grow without spoilage below 12.2 degrees C, and we then focused on storage temperatures below 12.2 degrees C in developing our secondary models. The temperature dependency of the mu(max) was described by Ratkowsky's square root model. The N-max of L. monocytogenes was modeled as a function of temperature, because the N-max of L. monocytogenes decreased as storage temperature increased. A tertiary model of L. monocytogenes was developed using the Baranyi model and mu(max) and N-max secondary models. The ranges of the numbers of L. monocytogenes bacteria were simulated using Monte Carlo simulations with an assumption that these parameters have variations that follow a normal distribution. Predictive simulations under both constant and fluctuating temperature conditions demonstrated a high accuracy, represented by root mean square errors of 0.44 and 0.34, respectively. The predicted ranges also seemed to show a reasonably good estimation, with 55.8 and 51.5% of observed values falling into the prediction range of the 25th to 75th percentile, respectively.

Here we examine whether oxygen delivery to tissues becomes limiting as body temperature increases and eventually causes death at upper lethal temperatures. Because of the limited direct, experimental evidence supporting this possibility in terrestrial arthropods, we explored the effect of ambient oxygen availability on the thermotolerance of insects representing six species (Acheta domesticus, Hippodamia convergens, Gromphadorhina portentosa, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, Tenebrio molitor, and Zophobus morio), four taxonomic orders (Blattodea, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Orthoptera), and multiple life stages (e.g., adults vs. larvae or nymphs). The survival curves of insects exposed to temperatures (45 degrees or 50 degrees C) under normoxic conditions (21% O-2) were compared with those measured under altered oxygen levels (0%, 10%, 35%, and 95% O-2). Kaplan-Meier log rank analyses followed by Holm-Sidak pairwise comparisons revealed that (1) anoxia sharply diminished survival times in all groups studied, (2) thermotolerance under moderate hyperoxia (35% O-2) or moderate hypoxia (10% O-2) was the same as or lower than that under normoxia, (3) half of the experimental treatments involving extreme hyperoxia (95% O-2) caused reduced thermotolerance, and (4) thermotolerance differed with developmental stage. Adult G. portentosa exhibited much higher thermotolerance than their first-instar nymphs, but responses from larval and adult Z. morio were equivocal.

In particular, we consider a simple model of a tracer that is harmonically bound within a mixture of hot and cold Brownian particles, which, like a mixture of active and passive particles, can phase separate. By measuring the fluctuations of the tracer, we find that this collective behavior gives rise to an effective temperature for the tracer. Additionally, we find that there is an increased tendency for cold particles to accumulate on the surface of the tracer due to the hot particles, potentially dampening its fluctuations and decreasing its effective temperature.

Forty two Nili-Ravi lactating buffaloes were uniformly divided into two groups of twenty one in each considering their lactation number, stage of lactation, body weight, dam's milk yield and milk yield in current lactation. The control (T-0) group buffaloes were kept in separate shed without any nutrient supplementation and modification in microclimate and management. The treatment (T-1) group was supplemented with niacin, yeast, edible oil in feed and provided curtains and mist fans in the shed, and altered feeding time, frequency and type of ration. The overall mean body weights in control and treatment group buffaloes were noted to be 517.4 kg and 523.4 kg, respectively. Under HD and HH seasons, mean body weights at different fortnights in treatment group buffaloes were 515.6 kg and 531.1 kg, respectively. In control group, the respective values were 512 kg and 522.7 kg. Although the body weights were higher in treatment than control group, there were no statistically significant differences between two experimental groups. The overall mean daily total dry matter intake (TDMI), dry matter intake through concentrate (CDMI), dry matter intake through dry fodder (DFDMI) and dry matter intake through green fodder (GFDMI) were noted to be 13.04, 4.21,1.02, 7.92, 14.13, 4.24, 1.17 and 8.65 kg in control and treatment group buffaloes, respectively. Under both seasons, treatment group buffaloes consumed more dry matter than control group throughout the experimental period. The values were also differed significantly (ranged from P<0.05 to P<0.0001) between two groups. The overall mean values of fortnightly total milk production were 103.2 kg in control group and 121.5 kg in treatment group. Throughout the period, treatment group buffaloes produced more milk than control. Milk production was also significantly (P<0.0001) differed between control and treatment groups under two seasons. The daily average additional input cost per buffalo was maximum (sic)22/- and additional income per buffalo was minimum 35/-. Therefore, the net profit was around 13/- per buffalo per day. The input: output ratio was calculated to be 1:1.59.

Here, we used fluctuating temperature regimes and exposed gypsy moth at specific points in development (first-fourth instar, pupa) to cycles of favorable (22-28 degrees C) or high-temperature treatments (30-36 degrees C, 32-38 degrees C, 34-40 degrees C) for either 2 or 7 d. We measured survival, growth, and prolonged effects of exposure on development time and pupal mass. Survival generally decreased as the experimental temperature treatment and duration of exposure increased for all instars and pupae, with a narrow threshold for lethal effects. In response to increasing temperature and magnified by longer exposure times, growth abruptly declined for third instars and development time increased for pupae. For those surviving the 2-d exposure treatment, development time to pupation increased for all instars, but we did not find consistent effects on final pupal mass.

Daily specific ingestion rates calculated were rather generally high, and ranged between 54 and 159% of body carbon, between 26 and 102% of body nitrogen and between 108 and 307% of body phosphorus. Regional and seasonal variations depended mainly upon variations in trophic conditions. Curvilinear relationships between ingestion production, or net production efficiency K2, and food concentration (as chlorophyll-a + phaeopigments) showed that food could have been a limiting factor. Furthermore, K2 were low when compared with data from the literature (mean of 21% in carbon, 39% in nitrogen and 11% in phosphorus). Complementary laboratory experiments carried out on adults fed with enriched natural particles or algal cultures (Tetraselmis sp. or Dunaliella sp.) showed similar production (egg-production) vs food concentration curvilinear relationships as in the field. However, considerably higher maximal ingestion and production rates were obtained for animals fed algal cultures suggesting that optima for food acquisition and transformation were not reached in field conditions. Consequently, A. clausi, which represents more than 50% of the zooplankton biomass, appears to be rather inefficient in transforming the abundant particulate organic matter produced in the lagoon. This results from its high level of metabolic expenditure through respiration or excretion (about 50% of ingestion in terms of carbon) and from the small size and poor trophic value of food particles (high percentage of detritus).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-8158,,,,,JAN 7,1994,272,1-3,,,,,147,161,,10.1007/BF00006518,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006518,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994MV62000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Conventional and low-external-input farming had similar influences on the disease incidence of rice blast.

Year round performance of the designed system is experimentally evaluated and presented. The designed system utilizes the constant temperature aquifer water available on the ground surface at around 24 degrees C (year round) in the agricultural field through deep tube-well used for irrigation purposes for heating a greenhouse in winter nights and cooling in summer days. Experimental performance of the designed system is tested during a full winter as well as for summer conditions. To enhance the efficiency of the system and to improve relative humidity during extreme summer conditions, a simple evaporative cooling process is also added within the same designed system. The experimental results show that the average greenhouse room air temperature is maintained 7-9 degrees C above ambient during winter nights and 6-7 degrees C below ambient in summer days besides decreasing the daily temperature fluctuations inside the greenhouse. Improvement in the average relative humidity during extreme summer conditions is also observed. Technoeconomic analysis of the greenhouse integrated to the designed aquifer coupled cavity flow heat exchanger system (ACCFHES) is also conducted based on the yield of capsicum and chilli crops and compared with those of the greenhouse without any thermal control system and the open field condition yields. An economic comparison of the ACCFHES has also been made with other existing thermal control technologies such as the earth air heat exchanger system, ground air collector, evaporative cooling using foggers and a fan and pad system.

This results in minimal or null water exchange. The sum of fish biomass and microorganisms favors alkalinity consumption and, consequently, pH reduction. It is in this context that the present study evaluates alkalinity and pH maintenance using sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) on BFT during a Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) nursery. In this study, 25 fishes/tank was distributed in nine experimental units (useful vol. 37.5 L) and the performance was evaluated at 60 days. During the assay, the temperature, oxygen and pH were maintained within the ideal range levels for Nile tilapia growth. All alkalizing compounds were able to pH and alkalinity correction, but when using NaHCO3, the alkalinity and pH were more elevated than the other treatments. Furthermore, at the beginning these assay, the total ammonia (TAN; NH3 + N-4(+)) and NO2--N accumulate and it caused a peak, but mostly experiment remained to very low levels because of the total nitrification activity, resulting in NO3- -N accumulation. Because the non water exchange, at the final experiment the ion Na+ accumulate when utilized NaHCO3, resulting in level similar to brackish water. While using CaCO3 or Ca(OH)(2), the Ca2+ ion accumulate, resulting in extremely hard water. Despite this, the fish survival was similar between treatments (about 80%). Moreover, the final weight, daily growth rate and net yield for NaHCO3 and Ca(OH)(2) they were higher than CaCO3 treatment. This may have been because of the higher total suspended solids (TSS) and lower protein content of the bioflocs in this treatment. In order to assess the possible physiologic alterations of the fish associated with the production system, the hematocrit, glycemia and plasmatic osmolality were evaluated. Furthermore, the antioxidant capacity against peroxy radicals (ACAP), lipid peroxidation (120) and catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities on the gills and liver were also evaluated. There were no differences in biochemical/physiological parameters when the different alkalizing compounds were utilized. The results demonstrate that the use of sodium bicarbonate, hydroxide or calcium carbonate is effective on the alkalinity and pH adjustments of the final proportion of 14.64 +/- 0.49, 7.18 +/- 032 e 24.09 +/- 2.32% in relation to the feed consumption, respectively. Thus, the study demonstrates that the use of NaHCO3 and Ca(OH)(2) are recommended for alkalinity and pH correction during Nile tilapia nursery on BFT systems, because of the higher growth and net yield, and this sum to less amount of these compounds may represent important economic gain.

The next generation of simulation models of forest response to climate change must build upon local observations of species interactions and growth along climatic gradients. We examined whether sugar maple (Acer saccharum) seedlings were disadvantaged with respect to soil nutrient uptake under coniferous canopies, as this species would need to migrate northward into conifer-dominated forests in response to climate change. An experimental design was applied to 3 sites, forming the largest possible latitudinal/climatic gradient for sugar maple in Quebec (Canada) and isolating the effect of conifer presence on its seedling's nutritional status. We tested whether: (1) both soil and climate and (2) presence of conifers affected foliar nutrient levels of sugar maple seedlings. Climate and soil (through pH) strongly affected nutrient availability for sugar maple seedlings and predicted 63.7% of their foliar nutrient variability. When controlling for site effects, we found a significant negative effect of conifers on foliar Ca and Mg levels of maple seedlings, which can adversely affect their overall health and vigour.

G.; Davey, Kenneth R.",,,Results from a commercial-scale experimental validation of a quantitative strategy to minimize energy used in conditioning of dry air in buildings in summer with fluctuating ambient and room occupancy rate,CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Conditioning of room air in summer is important globally. Many building however do not have an energy strategy predicated on quantitative unit-operations principles. To address this, a new probabilistic model was synthesised (Chem. Eng. Sci. XXX (2017) xxx-xxx) and a quantitative on-only strategy proposed to minimize electrical energy used. Here for the first time we report an extensive commercial-scale test of this strategy over 77 contiguous days of summer (Jan. to Mar.) in a large hotel (169 rooms) in S-E Australia (latitude -37.819708, longitude 144.959936) - a hot and dry clime. Two, dimensionally-identical suites (each of two rooms), with the same fit-out and (S-E) aspect, together with identical air conditioner (8.1 kW) and 'smart' (National Meter Identification) meters to automatically transmit contiguous (24-7) electrical use (at 30 min intervals) (n = 3696). Each suite (10.164 x 9.675 m floor plan) was auto-set to a bulk interior air temperature of 22 degrees C. In one (treated) the air conditioner was operated continuously (on-only), whilst in the other (control) it was left to wide-spread industry practice of switching on whilst the room is occupied, and off, when un-occupied (on-off). The suites had standard, single-glazed pane windows or curtain wall with heat-attenuating (fabric) internal curtains. Ambient peak temperature ranged from 17.8 to 39.1 degrees C. There were 32 days with recorded rainfall. Overall occupancy rate of both suites was almost identical at 69.6 and 71.2% respectively for the treated and control suite. This coincided with a typical business period for the hotel. Based on independent electrical energy invoices, results showed the treated suite used less energy on 47 days (61%) of the experimental period. Greenhouse gases were reduced by 12%. Savings in electrical energy cost of AUD $0.75 per day (9%), averaged over the period, were found for the treated suite adopting the alternative on-only strategy. Experimental findings overall therefore support the energy strategy hypothesis that continuous on only air conditioning will use less energy in summer. The hypothesis appears generalizable and could be adapted to a range of room geometries and seasons. Results will be of immediate interest to operators and managers of large public and commercial buildings that rely on conditioning of bulk dry air in summer.

The primary goal of these experimental campaigns was to study the momentum, heat and humidity fluxes over this part of the north-eastern Mediterranean Sea, characterized by limited spatial and temporal scales which could affect these exchanges at the air-sea interface. The great majority of the obtained records from both sites gave higher values up to factor of two, compared with the estimations from the most widely used parametric formulas that came mostly from measurements over open seas and oceans. Friction velocity values from both campaigns varied within the same range and presented strong correlation with the wind speed at 10 m height while the calculated drag coefficient values at the same height for both sites were found to be constant in relation with the wind speed. Using eddy correlation analysis, the heat flux values were calculated (virtual heat fluxes varied from -60 to 40 W/m(2)) and it was found that they are affected by the limited spatial and temporal scales of the responding air-sea interaction mechanism. Similarly, the humidity fluxes appeared to be strongly influenced by the observed intense spatial heterogeneity of the sea surface temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The current hypothesis states that elevated atmospheric CO2 (e[CO2]) can compensate for the negative effects of water scarcity regarding leaf gas exchanges and coffee bean quality traits over the canopy vertical profile, in interactions with light and temperature microclimate during the two final stages of berry development. Responses of Coffea arabica L. were observed in the 5th year of a free air CO2 enrichment experiment (FACE) under water-limited rainfed conditions. The light dependent leaf photosynthesis curves (A/PAR) were modelled for leaves sampled from vertical profile divided into four 50-cm thick layers. e[CO2] significantly increased gross photosynthesis (A(maxGross)), the apparent quantum yield efficiency, light compensation point, light saturation point (LSP) and dark respiration rate (R-d). As a specific stage response, considering berry ripening, all parameters calculated from A/PAR were insensitive to leaf position over the vertical profile. Lack of a progressive increase in A(maxGross) and LSP was observed over the whole canopy profile in both stages, especially in the two lowest layers, indicating leaf plasticity to light. Negative correlation of R-d to leaf temperature (T-L) was observed under e[CO2] in both stages. Under e[CO2], stomatal conductance was also negatively correlated with T-L, reducing leaf transpiration and R-d even with increasing T-L. This indicated coffee leaf acclimation to elevated temperatures under e[CO2] and water restriction. The e[CO2] attenuation occurred under water restriction, especially in A and water use efficiency, in both stages, with the exception of the lowest two layers. Under e[CO2], coffee produced berries in moderate- and high light level layers, with homogeneous distribution among them, contrasted to the heterogeneous distribution under actual CO2. e[CO2] led to increased caffeine content in the highest layer, with reduction of chlorogenic acid and lipids under moderate light and to raised levels of sugar in the shaded low layer. The ability of coffee to respond to e[CO2] under limited soil water was expressed through the integrated individual leaf capacities to use the available light and water, resulting in final plant investments in new reproductive structures in moderate and high light level layers.",,,,,"Ramalho, José C/G-2427-2014; Rakocevic, Miroslava/E-1439-2015","Ramalho, José C/0000-0002-7639-7214; Rakocevic, Miroslava/0000-0002-2068-8821",,,,,,,,,,,,,1445-4408,1445-4416,,,,,2021,48,5,,,,,469,482,,10.1071/FP20298,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP20298,,JAN 2021,,,,,,33423738,,,,,WOS:000606597800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We develop comprehensive analyses of the space-time kinematics of the tidal signals recorded in the compact high-sensitivity temperature loggers (CHTL) and the OBS geophones at the ocean bottom with depths ranging from 1254 to 1610 m. The evidence suggests that internal tides are responsible for the recorded signals: baroclinic internal waves (mainly the M2 tide) are generated by barotropic tidal currents in the Luzon Strait. The internal tides exhibit gradual phase changing and irregularly fluctuating strength, leaving signatures in the CHTL as ambient temperature variations, signifying low-mode wave motions within the stratified water layers; and in OBS geophones as intermittent tremor agitations, signifying high-mode turbulent flows on the seafloor. The M2 internal tides across our array are found to propagate in the northeast direction at speeds ranging from 1 to 2 + m s(-1). Furthermore, the internal tides are identified at the ocean-bottom based on an operational hydrodynamic hindcast/forecast model. The simulations show good agreement with the observed temperature variation on the seafloor and substantiate the vertical velocity and displacement of the water parcel driven by the internal tides. The joint detection of the temperature and tremor signals provides further information about the interactions of internal tides with the seafloor topography and the associated energy dissipation. Our results elucidate the space-time ubiquity of the internal tides at the ocean bottom, which is an important interface of dynamic oceanography.",,,,,"Chao, Benjamin Fong/N-6156-2013","CHANG, Emmy/0000-0002-9886-7643",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,MAY,2016,121,5,,,,,3381,3394,,10.1002/2015JC011370,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015JC011370,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000383466500033,View Full Record in Web of Science

The most susceptible areas to temperature fluctuation are shallow water environments, particularly estuaries, which serve as essential nursery habitats for juvenile southern flounder. While in the estuaries, juveniles develop, and sex is determined. Southern flounder exhibit genotypic sex determination; however, the sex of females is highly influenced by temperature, which can result in phenotypic sex reversal. The temperature-sensitive enzyme complex responsible for estrogen biosynthesis in vertebrates is aromatase cytochrome P450 (P450(arom)), a critical component in ovarian differentiation. In this study, mRNA expression of P450(arom), was used to identify presumptive males and females exposed to a gradient of temperatures (18, 21, 24, 27. and 30 degrees C) beginning at 35-40 or at 65-70 mm total length (TL). This research identifies that sex is influenced by temperature between 35 and 65 mm TL and establishes that increases in temperature from 18 degrees C during this size range, produce increasingly male skewed sex ratios in southern flounder from Texas.

We show that accurate estimates require ways to connect discrete observations of changing tree status (e.g., pre- vs. post budbreak) with continuous responses to fluctuating temperatures. By coherently synthesizing discrete observations with continuous responses to temperature variation, we accurately quantify how increasing temperature variation accelerates onset of growth. Application to warming experiments at two latitudes demonstrates that maximum responses to warming are concentrated in late winter, weeks ahead of the main budbreak period. Given that warming will not occur uniformly over the year, knowledge of when temperature variation has the most impact can guide prediction. Responses are large and heterogeneous, yet predictable.

During migration, these fish also encounter a range of pathogens that affect their survival. A significant myxozoan parasite, Ceratonova shasta, causes enteronecrosis in salmon, and this disease increases in severity as temperature and parasite dose increase. In complementary laboratory and field studies, we examined how the use of a thermal refuge (an area at least 2 degrees C colder than the main stem) affects progression of enteronecrosis in juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and Coho Salmon O. kisutch. We compared fish use, water temperature, and C. shasta concentration in a refuge at the Beaver Creek-Klamath River confluence during the summer in 2008 and 2010. Salmonid numbers ranged from 190 to 2,125, and temperatures were 2-8 degrees C cooler than in the main stem. In June and July of 2008, parasite levels in the refuge were lower than in the main stem, where they exceeded 100 spores/L. In 2010, main-stem parasite levels did not exceed 10 spores/L, and levels in the refuge were lower in June. In the laboratory, we compared the effect of fluctuating and constant temperature treatments on mortality rates of Chinook Salmon and Coho Salmon exposed to C. shasta. Under most experimental conditions, fluctuating temperature, within the range experienced by fish using thermal refuges (15.5-21 degrees C), had no significant effect on disease progression compared with a constant midrange temperature (18.5 degrees C) with equivalent degree-day accumulation. We propose that in the Klamath River thermal refuges can function as disease refuges from enteronecrosis by (1) providing areas of decreased C. shasta exposure and/or (2) alleviating disease effects as a result of relatively lower water temperatures. The trend of increasing water temperatures suggests that juvenile salmon will rely even more on these critical habitats in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-8487,1548-8659,,,,,2016,145,4,,,,,810,820,,10.1080/00028487.2016.1159612,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2016.1159612,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000379596200012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The lake was subjected to an experimental drawdown of 1.4 m in 1995 and 0.75 m in 1996 at the time tracking started. We used a radio-linked, acoustic positioning system that produced positions every 100 s for 18 tagged lake whitefish, eight of which provided depth information. Fish position and depth were put into a geographic information system database with information on substratum, slope, and depth. Mean daily locomotor activity declined as the spawning season progressed. Two patterns of behavior occurred in both years. Offshore-oriented fish spent their time along bottom contours, which increased in depth through the spawning season. Inshore-oriented fish spent their time along the shoreline, and exhibited site fidelity during spawning before moving to deeper offshore areas, where movement was reduced. For inshore-oriented fish, spawning positions were determined based on their presence in the littoral zone and a low instantaneous swimming speed of less than 6 cm/s. For these positions, only three substrata-boulder, cobble, and detritus-comprised 50% of these locations. Mean depth ranged from 2.7 m (+/-1.3, SD) to 3.5 m (+/-1.2) with mean slopes of 36% (+/-13.2%). We confirmed spawning by recapturing spent tagged fish; scuba divers also confirmed the presence of lake whitefish eggs at one site.

J,"Peters, DPC",,,,"Peters, DPC",,,Plant species dominance at a grassland-shrubland ecotone: an individual-based gap dynamics model of herbaceous and woody species,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Transition zones or ecotones between biomes are predicted to be particularly sensitive areas to directional changes in climate. However, for many ecotones, there is little understanding of the key processes that allow dominant species from adjacent biomes to coexist at transition zones and how differences in these processes affect species responses to changes in environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between plant life history traits and patterns in dominance and composition at a grassland-shrubland and transition zone in order to predict shifts in dominance with directional changes in climate. It was hypothesized that differences in life history traits allow species from adjacent biomes to coexist at this transition zone, and that these dominance patterns are dynamic through time as a result of species-specific responses to changes in climate. A mixed lifeform individual plant-based gap dynamics model (ECOTONE) was developed to examine consequences of differences in recruitment, resource acquisition, and mortality to patterns in species dominance and composition under a variety of soils and climatic conditions. This model is unique because it represents interactions among multiple potential dominant species that include congeneric species of one lifeform as well as herbaceous and woody lifeforms across multiple spatial scales. Similar to other gap models, ECOTONE simulates the recruitment, growth, and mortality of individual plants on a small plot through time at an annual timestep. ECOTONE differs from other gap models in the degree of detail involved in determining successful recruitment by each species and in the simulation of belowground resources. Individual plant root distributions and resource availability by depth are dynamic. Soil water content is simulated on a daily timestep and nitrogen is simulated monthly. Multiple spatial scales can be simulated using a grid of plots connected by seed dispersal. ECOTONE was parameterized for two soil types at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SEV), a site located within the transition zone between two major biomes in North America. Shortgrass steppe communities are dominated by the perennial grass Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama) and Chihuahuan desert communities are dominated by the perennial grass Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama) or the shrub Larrea tridentata (creosotebush). Experiments were conducted to provide key parameters related to recruitment and growth that were supplemented with information from the literature for remaining parameters. Model output was verified using field estimates of cover and biomass for the three dominant species as well as other groups of species. Simulation analyses were conducted under current climate and for a directional change in climate. Nitrogen was assumed constant for all runs to allow a focus on water availability constraints as affected by climate. Under Current climatic conditions, Simulated biomass on sandy loam soils was dominated by B. eviopoda with smaller biomass of B. gracilis and other species groups. By contrast, simulated biomass on a loamy sand soil was codominated by B. eriopoda and L. tridentata with very small biomass attributed to other species groups. Under a GFDL climate change scenario of increased year-round temperatures and increased Summer precipitation. vegetation patterns shifted to a clear dominance of biomass by B. eriopoda on both soil types. These results show that temporal partitioning of soil water is important to codominance by the two Bouteloua species, and that spatial and temporal partitioning of soil water is important for grass-shrub interactions. The results also suggest that global climate change may provide a mechanism for the recovery of B. eriopoda following shrub invasion in the Southwestern U.S. Thus, an individual-based modeling approach is capable of representing complex interactions among herbaceous and woody species as well as between congeneric species with different life history traits at a biome transition zone. This modeling approach is useful in improving our understanding of key processes driving these vegetation dynamics as well in predicting shifts in dominance as environmental conditions change in the future.

To improve understanding of these processes, the present study developed regression relationships between environmental variables and fine root dynamics within a northern hardwood forest in New Hampshire, USA, which was experimentally manipulated with a snow removal treatment. Fine roots (< 1 mm diameter) were observed using minirhizotrons for 2 years in sugar maple and yellow birch stands and analyzed in relation to temperature, water and nutrient availability. Fine root dynamics at this site fluctuated seasonally, with growth and mortality peaking during warmer months. Monthly fine root production was strongly associated with mean monthly air temperature and neither soil moisture nor nutrient availability added additional predictive power to this relationship. This relationship exhibited a seasonal temperature hysteresis, which was altered by snow removal treatment. These results suggest that both exogenous and endogenous cues may be important in controlling fine root growth in this system. Proportional fine root mortality was directly associated with mean monthly soil temperature, and proportional fine root mortality during the over-winter interval was strongly related to whether the soil froze. The strong relationship between fine root production and air temperature reported herein contrasts with findings from some hardwood forest sites and indicates that controls on fine root dynamics vary geographically. Future research must more clearly distinguish between endogenous and exogenous control over fine root dynamics in various ecosystems.",,,,,"Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014","Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890; Groffman, Peter/0000-0001-8371-6255",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,MAY,2003,9,5,,,,,670,679,,10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00622.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2003.00622.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000182653700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

For studies using biotelemetry, missing individuals pose a challenge since the ultimate fate of both the animal and the tag are unknown. In this study, we document three releases of carcasses in a simulated small-scale summer fish kill in a small urban stream using juvenile white sucker (Catostomus commersonii). Passive integrated transponder (PIT) and radio tags were affixed to carcasses that were tracked to determine the fate of both the dead fish and the tags. Mean daily dispersal distances ranged from 0.0 to 7.6 m day(-1) and included downstream and lateral dispersal. Of the 44 radio-tagged carcasses, 26 tags (and presumably carcasses) were consumed by scavengers; the majority were consumed by snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) with fewer carcasses scavenged by great blue heron (Ardea herodias), raccoon (Procyon lotor) and muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus). We also contrasted the decomposition rates of in-stream carcasses with those experimentally placed on the riverbank and found that while there was no significant difference in the time to carcass evisceration, the rate of decomposition was more rapid in-stream compared to on-shore. Radio tag loss during the decomposition study was moderate (one of three lost); PIT tag loss occurred when carcasses became eviscerated, typically by invertebrates. By examining the role of scavengers, dispersal and decomposition, it is possible to understand the fate of dead fish, the fate of tags and role of mortality in tagging experiments and the connections between stream and riparian habitats and organisms.

Here, we conducted a year-long experiment to explore the effect of warming on bacterial metabolic function of lake water and sediment. Predictions of the metabolic capabilities of these communities were performed with FAPROTAX using 16S rRNA sequencing data. The results indicated that the increase in temperature changed the structure of bacterial metabolic functional groups in water and sediment. During periods of low temperature, the carbon degradation pathway decreased, and the synthesis pathway increased, under the stimulation of warming, especially under the conditions temperature fluctuation. We also observed that nitrogen fixation ability was especially important in the warming treatments during the summer season. However, an elevated temperature significantly led to reduced nitrogen fixation abilities in winter. Compared with the water column, the most predominant functional groups of nitrogen cycle in sediment were nitrite oxidation and nitrification. Variable warming significantly promoted nitrite oxidation and nitrification function in winter, and constant warming was significantly inhibited in spring, with control in sediments. Co-occurrence network results showed that warming, especially variable warming, made microbial co-occurrence networks larger, more connected and less modular, and eventually functional groups in the water column and sediment cooperated to resist warming. We concluded that warming changed bacterial functional potentials important to the biogeochemical cycling in the experimental mesocosms in winter and spring with low temperature. The effect of different bacteria metabolism functions in water column and sediment may change the carbon and nitrogen fluxes in aquatic ecosystems.

Cells machinery is trusted to produce active proteins that are correctly phosphorylated and glycosylated. However, native physiological cellular processes that might be altered during the course of the experiment are often ignored. Here, we detected and quantified the effects of various electrophysiological recording conditions on the phosphorylation levels of Xenopus oocytes proteins, including membrane proteins, as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events modulate ion channels gating and cell surface expression. Two strategies were chosen to determine relative protein phosphorylation levels: a direct detection with a phospho-Ser/Thr PKA substrate antibody, and a functional method employing two different leak potassium channels as indicators, chosen based on their opposite responses to protein kinase phosphorylation. We report that holding potential, and bath solution properties such as pH, osmolarity, temperature and ion composition, dramatically affect protein phosphorylation levels in Xenopus oocytes. Our results might explain some of the fluctuations in the biophysical properties of expressed channels, often observed during electrophysiological measurements. Minimizing possible misinterpretations could be achieved using either mutated, kinase insensitive, channels or kinases/phosphatases modulators. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Most naturally-occurring RNA thermosensors are heat-inducible, have long sequences, and function by sequestering the ribosome binding site in a hairpin structure at lower temperatures. Here, we demonstrate the de novo design of short, heat-repressible RNA thermosensors. These thermosensors contain a cleavage site for RNase E, an enzyme native to Escherichia coli and many other organisms, in the 5' untranslated region of the target gene. At low temperatures, the cleavage site is sequestered in a stem-loop, and gene expression is unobstructed. At high temperatures, the stem-loop unfolds, allowing for mRNA degradation and turning off expression. We demonstrated that these thermosensors respond specifically to temperature and provided experimental support for the central role of RNase E in the mechanism. We also demonstrated the modularity of these RNA thermosensors by constructing a three-input composite circuit that utilizes transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regulation. A thorough analysis of the 24 thermosensors allowed for the development of design guidelines for systematic construction of similar thermosensors in future applications. These short, modular RNA thermosensors can be applied to the construction of complex genetic circuits, facilitating rational reprogramming of cellular processes for synthetic biology applications.",,,,,,"Moon, Tae Seok/0000-0001-8373-9051",,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-1048,1362-4962,,,,JUL 13,2015,43,12,,,,,6166,6179,,10.1093/nar/gkv499,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv499,,,,,,,,25979263,,,,,WOS:000359775200046,View Full Record in Web of Science

The highly synchronous behavior of individuals of the colony has important consequences for their thermal ecology. Air temperature in the tent fluctuates according to the caterpillars' activity: air temperature slowly rises about 2.5-3 degrees C above the surroundings when caterpillars aggregate in the tent after feeding and decreases rapidly when the larvae leave the tent. Thermal energy can be stored for a few hours when ambient temperature drops. Experiments show that metabolic heat production sufficiently explains this effect.

The photosynthesis-light response curves demonstrated an adaptation to shaded habitats for both species, as light compensation points in water and air for both species were below 17 +/- 5 mu mol.m(-1).s(-1). The rate of dehydration was significantly lower in thalli of B. calliptera compared to C. leprieurii.

We also tested whether populations from the centre (Poland) and margins (Russia) of the distribution range of L. decemlineata differ in their responses to subzero exposure and a low rearing temperature. Larvae of three ages were subjected to a subzero temperature (-4 degrees C for 3 h simulating night frost) twice, after which they were reared on a fluctuating temperature regime of 10-15 degrees C. These rearing conditions imitated cool summer temperatures beyond the beetles' current range, such as in Finland. Individuals of both populations were highly cold tolerant, as only 3.1% of larvae died immediately following the subzero treatment. Nonetheless, the low rearing temperature was harmful to beetles of both populations. It caused high larval (ca. 90%) and overwintering (ca. 80%) mortality.

Dung beetles are also sensitive to climate change, which may impact on the services that they provide. Using climate-controlled chambers, we investigated the potential effects of climate change on the performance of a tunnelling dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus. Over two trials, we exposed beetles to a +0 degrees C, +2 degrees C or +4 degrees C increase in diurnally fluctuating field recorded temperatures and measured survival, pat departure, reproduction (brood number and size) and dung burial by beetles. Temperature treatment did not affect pat departure behaviour. Relative to the control +0 degrees C chambers, beetle survival was higher in the +2 degrees C chambers, but there was no difference in survival between the +0 degrees C and +4 degrees C chambers. In Trial 1, brood number was reduced in both the +2 degrees C and +4 degrees C chambers, relative to the +0 degrees C chambers. In Trial 2, brood number was significantly reduced relative to control chambers in the +2 degrees C chambers only. Temperature did not affect brood size. Across temperature treatments, there was a significant, positive relationship between brood number and dung burial. However, trends in brood production with temperature were not mirrored by dung burial; the only reduction in dung burial was found in the warmest treatment of Trial 2. Our results suggest that initially, warming may not substantially reduce dung burial by O. taurus; however, ecosystem services may be impacted if lower brood production eventually reduces beetle numbers.

However, little work has been done to investigate the connectivity between growth and hydro-climate in peatland black spruce systems. The boreal forest is the largest global terrestrial biome and is highly threatened due to current and projected increases in temperatures for the northern latitudes. Here we explore the dynamics among annual black spruce growth, climate, and water table elevations using 45 years of in situ precipitation, temperature, and water table elevation coupled with dendrochronological analysis from six research peatlands at the Marcell Experimental Forest, MN, USA. From 1963 to 2010, we found weak relationships between water table elevation and black spruce growth at the six study sites. Instead, annual black spruce growth was most favourable during three climatic periods: (a) cool, moist conditions in mid-summer; (b) warm mid-spring temperatures; and (c) cool temperatures in the fall prior to the current growing season.

Yet, internal temperatures exhibited seasonal dynamics as did daily and seasonal CO2 levels. During in situ experiments under termite-excluded conditions within the mound, the growth of the crop parasite Pseudoxylaria was greater inside than outside the mound, i.e., Pseudoxylaria is termitariophilic'. Also, ex situ experiments on parasite isolates differing in growth rates and examined under controlled conditions in the absence of termites revealed a variable effect with fungal growth decreasing only under high CO2 and low temperature conditions, reflecting the in situ parasite growth fluctuations. In essence, the parasite appears to be adapted to survive in the termite mound. Thus the mound microclimate does not inhibit the parasite but the dynamic environmental conditions of the mound affect its growth to varying extents.

Testing thermal tolerance in wild and laboratory zebrafish populations,CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Model organisms can be useful for studying climate change impacts, but it is unclear whether domestication to laboratory conditions has altered their thermal tolerance and therefore how representative of wild populations they are. Zebrafish in the wild live in fluctuating thermal environments that potentially reach harmful temperatures. In the laboratory, zebrafish have gone through four decades of domestication and adaptation to stable optimal temperatures with few thermal extremes. If maintaining thermal tolerance is costly or if genetic traits promoting laboratory fitness at optimal temperature differ from genetic traits for high thermal tolerance, the thermal tolerance of laboratory zebrafish could be hypothesized to be lower than that of wild zebrafish. Furthermore, very little is known about the thermal environment of wild zebrafish and how close to their thermal limits they live. Here, we compared the acute upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima; CTmax) of wild zebrafish measured on-site in West Bengal, India, to zebrafish at three laboratory acclimation/domestication levels: wild-caught, F-1 generation wild-caught and domesticated laboratory AB-WT line. We found that in the wild, CTmax increased with increasing site temperature. Yet at the warmest site, zebrafish lived very close to their thermal limit, suggesting that they may currently encounter lethal temperatures. In the laboratory, acclimation temperature appeared to have a stronger effect on CTmax than it did in the wild. The fish in the wild also had a 0.85-1.01 degrees C lower CTmax compared to all laboratory populations. This difference between laboratory-held and wild populations shows that environmental conditions can affect zebrafish's thermal tolerance. However, there was no difference in CTmax between the laboratory-held populations regardless of the domestication duration. This suggests that thermal tolerance is maintained during domestication and highlights that experiments using domesticated laboratory-reared model species can be appropriate for addressing certain questions on thermal tolerance and global warming impacts.",,,,,"Morgan, Rachael/AAA-1165-2020; Jutfelt, Fredrik/B-6988-2014; Vendrell, Marius/AAF-6528-2020","Morgan, Rachael/0000-0001-9589-6388; Jutfelt, Fredrik/0000-0001-9838-3991; Sundin, Josefin/0000-0003-1853-4046",,,,,,,,,,,,,2051-1434,,,,,JUN 24,2019,7,,,,,,,,coz036,10.1093/conphys/coz036,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coz036,,,,,,,,31249690,,,,,WOS:000484521600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, we know very little about soil carbon and nitrogen processes under the snowpack in these ecosystems, including the Tibetan Plateau. We conducted an experiment comparing three snow regimes (11 m x 1 m plots) of different snow depths and durations at an altitude of 4,100 m in the Minshan Range on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The three snow regimes included a shallow and short duration snowpack (SS; depth <10 cm), a moderate snow depth and medium duration snowpack (MS; depth <20 cm), as well as a deep and long duration snowpack (DS; depth > 30 cm). This study explores the effects of different snow conditions on soil temperature, and further describes the sequence and timing of dissolved nutrients and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) in soils under different snow regimes during the autumn-winter transition (i.e. November 7, 2008 - March 7, 2009). Three successive phases of temperature change were distinguished: I - initial decline - soil temperatures dropped steadily from 4 degrees C to about 0 degrees C at the same rate for all three snow regimes; II - moderate freezing - soil temperatures fluctuated between 0 degrees C and -7 degrees C under all three snow regimes; III - multiple freeze-thaw cycles took place in the SS and MS regimes, but permanent freezing occurred in the DS regime. Under moderate freezing, we found that soil temperature fluctuation was an essential factor for the transformation of soil C and N. Our results indicate that larger temperature fluctuations correlate with a greater increase in dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content increased markedly only under the most drastic temperature fluctuations. In contrast, MBC content increased significantly only when soil temperatures were relatively steady. Under the permanent freezing, only a large number of freeze-thaw cycles caused a significant decline of NO3--N and DOC concentrations. DON content declined markedly under permanent freezing and multiple freeze-thaw cycles. However, MBC content declined significantly only under permanent freezing. Ultimately, multiple freeze-thaw cycles resulted in the export of dissolved nutrients (organic and inorganic nitrogen) from the alpine ecosystem which had previously accumulated in the moderate freezing phase of the soil.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1505-2249,,,,,,2010,58,4,,,,,717,728,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000285679100011,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about how intra-site historical climate variability can mediate the influences of current climate differences on community dissimilarity and assembly. To fill this gap, we examined and disentangled the interactive effects of historical climate variability and current climate differences on the soil bacterial community dissimilarity and stochasticity of community assembly among 143 sites from 28 forests across eastern China. We hypothesize that the relative importance of stochasticity and community dissimilarity are related to historical climate variability and that an increasing sum of intra-site historical variability enhances stochasticity while reduces dissimilarity between two communities. To test our hypothesis, we statistically controlled for covariates between sites including differences in soil chemistry, plant diversity, spatial distance, and seasonal climate variations at annual timescales. We observed that an increase in inter-site current climate differences led to a reduced impact of stochasticity in community assembly and a pronounced divergence between communities. In stark contrast, when communities were subjected to a high level of intra-site historical climate fluctuation, the observed impact incurred from current climate differences was substantially weakened. Moreover, the influence of increased historical variability was consistent along the gradient of current temperature differences between sites. However, effects induced by historical fluctuation in precipitation were disproportional and only evident when small inter-site differences were observed. Consequently, if the prior climate variability is ignored, especially regarding environmental factors like temperature, we assert that the influence current climate differentiation has on regulating community dissimilarity and assembly stochasticity will be underestimated. Together, our findings highlight the importance and need of explicitly controlling the mean and the historical variability of climate factors for the next generation of climate change experiments to come.",,,,,"Kuang, Jialiang/AAY-5448-2021","Ning, Daliang/0000-0002-3368-5988; Bates, Colin/0000-0002-1468-818X; Kuang, Jialiang/0000-0001-9492-6151",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,NOV,2021,27,22,,,,,5963,5975,,10.1111/gcb.15848,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15848,,AUG 2021,,,,,,34403163,,,,,WOS:000690746400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Monthly variations in cyst abundance and germination were tracked, and the effects of environmental factors (water temperature, pH, light and nutrients) on cyst germination were measured in the laboratory under ambient field conditions. During the bloom period, the cyst abundance of P. bipes in sediment samples fluctuated from 4 to 427 cells g(-1) (wet weight), and did not show season-dependent variation. During the same period, the number of vegetative cells of P. bipes in water samples varied from 0 to 9.79 x 10(2) ml(-1). Laboratory experiments revealed a maximum germination rate at 15.6 degrees C, and effective germination was observed at the naturally occurring pH values of 6 to 8, but not at pH 9. Cysts obtained from samples collected at higher temperatures (over 15 degrees C) germinated more quickly than those seeded at lower temperatures, while cysts collected in fall and early winter had a higher cumulative excystment rate than those collected in spring and summer, suggesting that cysts deposited at higher temperatures may act as a seed population for the winter blooms. These findings collectively indicate that germination of R bipes was mainly affected by water temperature and light intensity, and not nutrient levels and pH, and further show that the bloom of P. bipes observed in Juam Reservoir was likely promoted by the presence of sufficient nutrients, relatively high excystment rates and active growth occurring under low temperature conditions.",,,,,"Kim, Baik-Ho/D-9356-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0948-3055,,,,,MAY 30,2007,47,3,,,,,213,221,,10.3354/ame047213,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame047213,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000247499300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Six species showed a marked seasonal cycle with high germination percentages in spring and very low percentages in other seasons. The results of the burial experiment were similar to the pattern of seedling emergence in field conditions. High percentage germination in spring could be simulated in controlled conditions for Melilotus albus , Medicago lupulina , Lotus corniculatus , Trifolium pratense and T. repens . Seeds of T. pratense had a high percentage germination after cold treatment, whereas seeds of the other four species were brought to germination by chilling for 8 wk followed by exposure to daily alternating temperatures (15/6degreesC or 20/10degreesC).

The accuracy of these models is limited, by uncertainty in distributed precipitation forcings. In this research, different precipitation distribution schemes were compared through inter-station transfer experiments, as well as within a distributed hydrologic model applied at <= 150 m resolution over four study catchments in complex terrain. Distributed precipitation estimates were derived using multiplicative spatial scaling (MSS) and map-based precipitation (MBP) techniques including both climatological and time-varying spatial information from a range of native spatial resolutions (500 m-4 km). The primary interest was to evaluate a novel application of satellite-based snow water equivalent (SWE) reconstruction (RSWE) as a surrogate for cold season precipitation against a common source of spatial precipitation information: the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). An elevation-based orographic precipitation gradient and simple inverse-distance interpolation were also included as a baseline. For the case of RSWE, MSS was very sensitive to differences between observed SWE and reconstructed SWE, producing positive biases in the catchment water balance. Over 12 year simulations, daily streamflow correlations from the uncalibrated model were highest for RSWE when adjusted for accumulation-season sublimation, and for monthly PRISM, both achieving R=0.8, where the former performed better during anomalous years for both MSS and MBP. Annual water balance ratios were much more sensitive to the choice of distribution scheme, with large overestimates,>30%, for RSWE products using the MSS techniques versus MBP (<15%).

However, due to the large thermal inertia, the conventional control strategies based on heuristic rules have difficulty handling a room temperature response to changes in weather or set-points. Because of the excellent coping ability, model predictive control (MPC) has aroused increasing attention as a promising solution to manage RFH. This research is focused on the MPC scheme for RFH systems, especially large-scale RFH systems with hydraulic coupling. First, we develop a novel control-oriented thermodynamic model for an RFH system. A new calculating method for the floor surface temperature is adopted to avoid defining the thermal resistance and thermal capacity of the virtual core temperature layer, and the heat transfer along water flow and weather elements like solar radiation and wind are considered. Then an experiment is conducted to validate that the accuracy can be adequate for the prediction of MPC. Next, we design a distributed MPC scheme for RFH systems with hydraulic coupling. A supply reset rule for central equipment is improved, and a hierarchical optimization algorithm is proposed to implement the distributed MPC scheme.

Black carbon (BC) deposition over continents induces a reduction in the mean number of days with snow at the surface (MNDWS) that ranges from 0 to 10 days over large areas of Eurasia and Northern America for the present-day relative to the pre-industrial period. This is mainly due to BC deposition during the spring, a period of the year when the remaining of snow accumulated during the winter is exposed to both strong solar radiation and a large amount of aerosol deposition induced themselves by a high level of transport of particles from polluted areas. North of 30 degrees N, this deposition flux represents 222 Gg BC month(-1) on average from April to June in our simulation. A large reduction in BC emissions is expected in the future in all of the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. In particular, considering the RCP8.5 in our simulation leads to a decrease in the spring BC deposition down to 110 Gg month-1 in the 2050s. However, despite the reduction of the aerosol impact on snow, the MNDWS is strongly reduced by 2050, with a decrease ranging from 10 to 100 days from present-day values over large parts of the Northern Hemisphere. This reduction is essentially due to temperature increase, which is quite strong in the RCP8.5 scenario in the absence of climate mitigation policies. Moreover, the projected sea-ice retreat in the next decades will open new routes for shipping in the Arctic. However, a large increase in shipping emissions in the Arctic by the mid-21st century does not lead to significant changes of BC deposition over snow-covered areas in our simulation. Therefore, the MNDWS is clearly not affected through snow darkening effects associated with these Arctic ship emissions. In an experiment without nudging toward atmospheric reanalyses, we simulated however some changes of the MNDWS considering such aerosol ship emissions. These changes are generally not statistically significant in boreal continents, except in Quebec and in the West Siberian plains, where they range between -5 and -10 days. They are induced both by radiative forcings of the aerosols when they are in the snow and in the atmosphere, and by all the atmospheric feedbacks. These experiments do not take into account the feedbacks induced by the interactions between ocean and atmosphere as they were conducted with prescribed sea surface temperatures. Climate change by the mid-21st century could also cause biomass burning activity (forest fires) to become more intense and occur earlier in the season. In an idealised scenario in which forest fires are 50% stronger and occur 2 weeks earlier and later than at present, we simulated an increase in spring BC deposition of 21 Gg BC month(-1) over continents located north of 30 degrees N. This BC deposition does not impact directly the snow cover through snow darkening effects.

In this study, as an example, the combined RFCAFC system was studied in a high humidity environment in Jinan, Shandong Province, China. The novelty of the combined RFCAFC system lies in its ability to automatically adjust the water supply temperature of the radiant floor and fan coil in real time according to outdoor meteorological conditions, achieving thermal comfort while eliminating the likelihood of condensation on the radiant floor surface. Days with similar outdoor meteorological conditions were grouped, and the comfort level and hourly cooling performance coefficient (EERh) of different operating strategies for different outdoor meteorological conditions were monitored along with other evaluation indicators. The RFCAFC had good energy efficiency and comfort in a high humidity room environment. This study showed that the indoor vertical air temperature difference ranged from 1.6 to 1.8 degrees C, which met the ASHRAE55-2017 standard. The radiant floor surface temperature uniformity coefficient (S) fluctuated between 0.7 and 1.0, and the time it took the radiant floor surface temperature to reach 63.2% of the total variability range (tau(63)) for different operation strategies based on different outdoor meteorological conditions ranged between 4.4 and 4.7 h, which was within the normal range. The proportion of the total cooling capacity contributed by fan coil cooling under low temperature and high humidity (LH), high temperature and low humidity (HL), and medium temperature and medium humidity (MM) were 68.0%, 73.8%, and 71.7%, respectively. Based on this study, the following recommendations for the combined cooling system can be made: (1) When the outdoor humidity is high, the radiant floor system should be turned on early to provide cooling capacity. When the outdoor temperature is high, the fan coil system should be turned on early to reduce the indoor temperature. (2) To reduce energy consumption and achieve efficient operation of the system, the radiant floor system should be continuously operated to maximize its contribution to the cooling capacity, while the fan coil can be operated intermittently. Natural cooling can be integrated to provide additional cooling capacity to the room in the hours preceding occupation (i.e., 7:00-9:00). (3) The operation strategy of the combined cooling system must be able to respond in real time to changes in outdoor meteorological conditions to prevent discomfort in times of extreme heat or humidity.",,,,,"Liu, Jiying/T-4645-2018","Liu, Jiying/0000-0001-7385-6959",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2075-5309,,,,APR,2022,12,4,,,,,,,499,10.3390/buildings12040499,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/buildings12040499,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000785243600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous laboratory experiments in controlled environments showed that the only vapor transport process through the DSL is by Fick's law of diffusion. However, field experiments exhibited consistently higher evaporation rates than predicted by diffusion flow only. Some proposed reasons for the mismatch were: (a) daily cycles of condensation and evaporation in the DSL due to changes in solar radiation; (b) wind effects on air movement in the DSL; (c) atmospheric pressure fluctuations; (d) nonlinear influence of the DSL thickness on the evaporation process. To link the laboratory experiments with field observations, we performed soil column experiments in the laboratory with thick (>50 cm) DSL, and with different wind speeds, two radiative lamp schedules (continuous and 12 h daily cycles) and different thicknesses of DSL. Atmospheric pressure, air temperature and humidity were measured continuously. The results show that the evaporation rates observed are larger than those predicted by diffusion flow only. We found that it was possible to model the evaporation rates as a function of atmospheric pressure fluctuations. In conclusion, atmospheric pressure fluctuations can induce evaporation rates in DSL larger than estimated by diffusion flow only, possibly explaining the discrepancy between laboratory and field evaporation rates.",,,,,,"Balugani, Enrico/0000-0002-3879-9255",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,AUG,2021,57,8,,,,,,,e2020WR028286,10.1029/2020WR028286,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR028286,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000688205400057,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature and humidity conditions favourable for mould growth are presented as a mathematical model. The mould index has an upper limit which depends on temperature and relative humidity. This limiting value can also be interpreted as the critical relative humidity needed for mould growth depending also on the mould growth itself. The model enables to calculate the development of mould growth on the surface of small wooden samples exposed to arbitrary fluctuating temperature and humidity conditions including dry periods.

In order to validate the THBM against field measurements, real climate conditions in Sydney, Australia are adopted and the time variations of both internal and external convective and radiative heat transfer coefficients are calculated using empirical correlations from the literature. An alternative concrete wall model is also developed for further validation of the THBM. Good agreements between the THBM simulation and field data are achieved for both the water wall and concrete wall systems. The validated THBM is then adopted in a sensitivity analysis in order to assess the thermal performance of the semi-transparent water wall system under different configurations. It is found that the daily maximum water and air temperatures decrease significantly with the decrease of the transmissivity of the semi-transparent panels, whereas an increase of the attenuation coefficient of solar radiation in water has an insignificant impact on the water and air temperatures. The present results also indicated that increasing the thickness of the water column can reduce the fluctuations of the water temperature and the diurnal peak air temperature. From the practical application point of view, reducing the transmissivity of the external panel provides the most effective way to mitigate over-heating in the semi-transparent water wall system.

The cycle of soil nitrate lagged behind the annual temperature cycle by about 3 months. Multiple regression using temperature and soil water deficit explained 68% of the variation in nitrate-N. The identification of this pattern of soil nitrate may not enable the prediction of September soil nitrate (currently used to estimate N fertiliser requirement for the forthcoming crop) from soil sampled up to 3 months earlier. Laboratory incubation studies confirmed temperature and soil water as highly significant in determining the soil's mineral N status. By applying the temperature and soil water deficits which prevailed during the field observations to the regression equation derived from the laboratory data, a similar fluctuating pattern of soil nitrate emerged. Incubation of intact field cores under low temperatures produced a net N immobilisation and high temperatures produced a net N mineralisation. Immobilisation and remineralisation of N by the soil biomass (rather than leaching or denitrification) were responsible for the oscillations in nitrate-N, and these processes were largely driven by temperature and soil water status.",,,,,"Rochester, rocky/L-7600-2013; Constable, Greg A/F-1069-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0816-1089,,,,,,1991,31,2,,,,,237,244,,10.1071/EA9910237,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA9910237,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991FR37000016,View Full Record in Web of Science

There was a clear pattern in egg production in relation to lunar phase, with egg production peaks occurring between full and new moon phases for all three stocking densities. Mean gonadosomatic index values differed significantly among sampling months for both females and males. Analysis of ovaries via histological sections indicated trends in oocyte stages that correlated to continued egg production for this fractionally spawning species. Peak egg production occurred between April and mid-May, when mean (+/- SD) weekly water temperatures ranged from 23.8 +/- 1.7 degrees C to 28.2 +/- 1.2 degrees C.

This shift has coincided with a recent resumption of global warming after a hiatus in the 2000s. Based on a model-data analysis using an ensemble empirical mode decomposition, we identified a distinct low-frequency mode of the sea level in the tropical Pacific and showed its connection to global ocean warming and the suppression of global warming during the early 2000s, as well as the resumption of warming during recent years. Hindcast and model experiments conducted to illustrate the physical mechanism linking the decadal mode to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation-related trade winds, which regulate the strength of the Equatorial Undercurrent and the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean, revealed an El Nino-like state for the last several years. Plain Language Summary In contrast to previous decade, since roughly 2011, sea level in the western tropical Pacific has declined, while sea level in the central-to-eastern tropical Pacific has increased. This study focuses on a decadal shift in the tropical Pacific Ocean toward a low-frequency El Nino-like state, which coincides with a recent resumption of global warming after a hiatus in the 2000s. Here we identify whether the recent shift is a short-term change associated with ENSO or longer-term change and examine how the decadal shift in the Pacific is linked to the recent acceleration of global ocean warming. The model-data analysis allows us to gain insight into the evolution of sea level and ocean circulation in the Pacific Ocean on decadal time scale, as well as the accuracy and reliability of observed decadal fluctuation. The decadal mode presented here could lead to a better understanding of how sea level and ocean circulation respond to the Pacific climate variability.",,,,,"Song, Y. Tony/G-9514-2016","Song, Y.

Trout were observed by using radiotelemetry from August to November in headwater stretches isolated by artificial obstacles without fish ladders. The length of isolated headwater stretches ranged between 5.7 and 16.1 km. Migration distance per day and total migration length over the study period (total migration) were analyzed. In total, 1,957 individual fish positions were recorded. In general, the brown trout spawning migration reflected the seasonality with respect to temperature. Migration distance per day was low in August, reached a maximum in October, and then decreased in November. In isolated headwaters, trout adapted their migrations to the length of available free migration stretches, as both migration descriptors (migration distance per day and total migration) increased according to this variable. Moon phase appeared to be the key factor that influenced the timing of brown trout migration activity on a daily basis. High migration distance per day occurred during the eclipse of the moon, whereas the lowest migration distance per day occurred during the full moon. Furthermore, migration distance per day decreased with increasing river slope. The other variables tested (sex and physicochemical parameters, such as flow, pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen) did not affect brown trout migration activity. The results indicated that despite the restrictions of upstream migrations by lateral obstacles without fish ladders, brown trout migration activity in artificially isolated headwaters with pristine morphology is preserved. Furthermore, the analyses revealed a significant impact of the moon phase on brown trout migration that has not been previously described for this species.

Urchin activity decreased as urchin density increased. Individuals alternated between moving and being stationary and their behaviour did not appear to be affected by either current velocity (within the range from 0 to 15 cm s(-1)) and temperature (2.3 to 6.0 degrees C). Movement of individuals at each location was compared to that predicted by a random walk model. Mean move length (linear distance between two stationary periods), turning angle and net squared displacement were calculated for each individual. The distribution of turning angles was uniform at each location and there was no evidence of a relationship between urchin density and either move length or urchin velocity. The random model predicted a higher dispersal rate at locations with low urchin densities, such as barrens habitats. However, the movement was sometimes greater or less than predicted by the model, suggesting the influence of local environmental factors. The deviation of individual paths from the model revealed that urchins can be stationary or adopt a local (displacement less than random), random or directional movement. The net daily distance displaced on the barrens, predicted by a random walk model, was similar to the observed movement recorded in our previous study of tagged urchins at one site, but less than that observed at a second site. We postulate that the random dispersal of urchins allows individuals on barrens to reach the kelp zone where food is more abundant although the time required to reach the kelp zone may be considerable (months to years). Urchins decrease their rate of dispersal once they reach the kelp zone so that they likely remain close to this abundant food sources for long periods. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Freeze-thaw alters soil physical and biogeochemical properties with implications for carbon persistence and emissions in Arctic landscapes. We examined whether different freeze-thaw histories in two soil systems led to contrasting biogeochemical responses under a laboratory-controlled freeze-thaw incubation. We investigated controls on carbon composition through Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) to identify nominal carbon oxidation states and relative abundances of aliphatic-type carbon molecules in both surface and subsurface soils. Soil cores (similar to 60 cm-depth) were sampled from two sites in Alaskan permafrost landscapes with different in situ freeze-thaw characteristics: Healy (>40 freeze-thaw cycles annually) and Toolik (<15 freeze-thaw cycles annually). FT-ICR-MS was coupled with in situ temperature data and soil properties (i.e., soil texture, mineralogy) to assess (a) differences in soil organic matter composition associated with previous freeze-thaw history and (b) sensitivity to experimental freeze-thaw in the extracted cores. Control (freeze-only) samples showed greater carbon oxidation in Healy soils compared with Toolik, even in lower mineral horizons where freeze-thaw history was comparable across both sites. Healy showed the most loss of carbon compounds following experimental freeze-thaw in the lower mineral depths, including a decrease in aliphatics. Toolik soils responded more slowly to freeze-thaw as shown by intermediary carbon oxidation distributed across multiple carbon compound classes.

Insects are sensitive to climate change. Consequently, insect-mediated ecosystem functions and services may be altered by changing climates. 2. Dung beetles provide multiple services by burying manure. Using climate-controlled chambers, the effects of warming on dung burial and reproduction by the dung beetle Sisyphus rubrus Paschalidis, 1974 were investigated. Sisyphus rubrus break up dung by forming and rolling away balls of manure for burial and egg deposition. 3. To simulate warming in the chambers, 0, 2 or 4 degrees C offsets were added to field-recorded, diurnally fluctuating temperatures. We measured dung ball production and burial, egg laying, survival and residence times of beetles. 4. Temperature did not affect the size or number of dung balls produced; however warming reduced dung ball burial by S. rubrus. Because buried balls were more likely to contain eggs, warming could reduce egg laying via a reduction in ball burial. Warming reduced the humidity inside the chambers, and a positive relationship was found between the number of dung balls produced and humidity in two temperature treatments. Temperature did not affect survival, or whether or not a beetle left a chamber. Beetles that did leave the chambers took longer to do so in the warmest treatment. 5. This study demonstrates that climate warming could reduce reproduction and dung burial by S. rubrus, and is an important first step to understanding warming effects on burial services. Future studies should assess warming effects in field situations, both on individual dung beetle species and on aggregate dung burial services.",,,,,"Andrew, Nigel/B-7162-2008","Andrew, Nigel/0000-0002-2850-2307; Holley, Jean/0000-0003-4212-5998",,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,APR,2019,44,2,,,,,206,216,,10.1111/een.12694,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.12694,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000460077500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data set involved 69 field trials (1993 to 2003) focusing on factors affecting the epidemic onset of this disease. Observations were made at weekly intervals, recording the calendar week when canopy closure occurred (growth stage according to BBCH scale = 39) and symptom development by assessing the percentage of infected leaf area on a single-leaf basis (n = 40 plants). These monitoring trials revealed that epidemic onset varied between early July and mid-September. Hence, the target was to identify the reasons for this variation in order to deduct the most suitable approach for predicting epidemic onset. Differences in cultivar resistance explained part of epidemic onset variability, as did different timings of canopy closure, presumably due to associated microclimate changes. Moreover, meteorological variables were considered as potential reasons for variation in epidemic onset. The weather-dependent infection probability was assessed by daily infection values (DIV) in the range from 0 to 1 using hourly weather data. For calculating DIVs, the temperature effect was quantified by the proportions of the latent period (LP) relative to the optimum at 20 to 25degreesC, established by artificial inoculation of sugar beet plants in growth cabinets. Artificial infection experiments further established that air relative humidity (RH) >95% or leaf wetness was required for infection and subsequent lesion development. Under field conditions, the probability of leaf wetness was 75% at RH >90%. Therefore, DIVs were set to 0 for RH less than or equal to90% in the absence of precipitation (moisture index 1). Alternatively, the effect of moisture was modeled with a sigmoidal function describing the occurrence of leaf wetness in dependence of RH in the field (moisture index 11). Using this approach, DIV values were cumulated (c-DIV) for each of the 69 trials beginning either at fixed starting dates (I May, 16 May, or I June) or the dates of canopy closure. Accumulation of DIV ended at the time of epidemic onset. The two different moisture index definitions had no significant influence on c-DIV; whereas, for starting time Of Summation of DIV, the date of canopy closure was more suitable. Values of c-DIV ranged from 7 to 19 in highly susceptible cultivars and 12 to 25 in cultivars with lower susceptibility. Given this variation, c-DIV values were insufficient to explain differences in the date of epidemic onset and thus were not considered suitable for making accurate and precise management decisions. However, a negative prognosis assessing the most likely periods of disease absence was possible by determining the minimum c-DIV as a threshold. This threshold was 7 c-DIV for highly susceptible cultivars and 12 c-DIV for cultivars with low susceptibility. Crop monitoring is recommended as soon as these threshold values are exceeded so that the exact epidemic onset time can be observed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-949X,,,,,MAR,2005,95,3,,,,,269,274,,10.1094/PHYTO-95-0269,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-95-0269,,,,,,,,18943120,,,,,WOS:000227285500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study compared the theoretical CWSI averaged over morning hours, CWSImo, and over solar noon hours, CWSImd, of apple trees. This study also assessed their sensitivity to the changes in soil water status (soil water deficit [SWD, %] and soil water potential [SWP, kPa]) at different root zone depths. Four different types of commercial and experimental apple orchards with different characteristics growing under semi-arid conditions in Washington State, United States, were chosen to assess CWSI(mo)against CWSI(md)sensitivity to soil water status. In some of these locations, soil water status ranged from fully watered to severely stressed (low water deficit to high water deficit). Ground-based thermal and microclimate measurements were recorded continuously at 10-s intervals and acquired for the 15-min average on a daily basis throughout the study period. The linear relationship between SWD and CWSI(mo)at the effective root zone depth (average of 0-150 mm and 0-460 mm) resulted in a slightly higher correlation (R-2= 0.42-0.64,p< .001) compared to the traditional CWSImd(R-2= 0.32-0.60,p< 0.001). The correlation between CWSI(mo)and SWP (R-2= 0.38-0.69,p< 0.001) was found to be larger than the correlation between CWSI(mo)and SWD, while SWP was less correlated with CWSImd(R-2= 0.33-0.55,p< 0.001). Interestingly, a better relationship between soil water status and both CWSI(mo)and CWSI(md)was observed using a nadir view orientation thermal measurement.

We exposed captive males to an acute thermal challenge (43 degrees C) compared with thermoneutral (35 degrees C) and lower (27 degrees C) temperatures. We found significantly more heat dissipation behaviours at 43 degrees C, a temperature previously shown to reduce song production and fertility, and more heat retention behaviours at 27 degrees C. Next, we characterized transcriptomic responses in tissues important for mating effort-the posterior telencephalon, for its role in song production, and the testis, for its role in fertility and hormone production. Differential expression of hundreds of genes in the testes, but few in the brain, suggests the brain is less responsive to extreme temperatures. Nevertheless, gene network analyses revealed that expression related to dopaminergic signalling in the brain covaried with heat dissipation behaviours, providing a mechanism by which temporary thermal challenges may alter motivational circuits for song production. In both brain and testis, we observed correlations between thermally sensitive gene networks and individual differences in thermoregulatory behaviour.

In this paper, the yield of winter wheat over 50 years of farmyard manure, N, P and K fertilizer application (12 treatments altogether) was analysed in the Lukavec Crop Rotation Experiment (LCRE), which was established in 1955 in a potato-growing area (mean annual precipitation and temperature 686 mm and 6.8 degrees C, respectively). In the unfertilized control, low plant available P, K and Mg concentrations were recorded after 50 years. The annual yield growth (AYG)of grain was negative in the control as well as in low N treatments and positive in the 46 kg N ha(-1) treatment. The mean AYG ranged from 7.1 to 72.8 kg ha(-1) following the application of 46 to 121 kg N ha(-1), respectively. In the first decade of the experiment, the increase in grain yield per I kg of applied N was 7.3 kg ha(-1) while in the last decade it was 27.1 kg ha(-1). The mean grain yield of long-straw and short-straw varieties was 3.9 and 4.7 t ha(-1), respectively. In the control, the grain yields were 4.3, 3.2 and 2.4 t ha(-1) after root crops, legumes and cereals, respectively. To summarize the 50 years' results of winter wheat production in the LCRE, grain yield was the most affected by mineral fertilizers, followed by the effect of variety, the preceding crop and farmyard manure application. The long-term Sustainability of winter wheat production on low productive sandy-loamy Cambisols can be achieved only by adequate application of N, P and K fertilizers. High year-to-year variation in grain yield stresses the necessity of long-term studies in crop research, which are able to separate real trends from inter-annual fluctuations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Geissler, K; Gzik, A",,,,"Geissler, Katja; Gzik, Axel",,,Germination ecology of three endangered river corridor plants in relation to their preferred occurrence,FLORA,,,,,,,,,,,,"As a contribution to conservation, we investigated germination requirements of three perennial, endangered river corridor plants of Central European lowlands coexisting in subcontinental flood meadows, but preferring particular zones of decreasing flooding frequency and duration along the elevational gradient of the banks. It was hypothesized that the species have specific germination requirements to respond successfully to open patch creation depending on their occurrence along the gradient of spring flooding in the field. This study involved controlled experiments and phenological studies. Juncus atratus and Gratiola officinalis, which frequently occupy flooded, naturally disturbed sites, have an absolute light requirement for germination, typical of pioneer species. Summer-dispersed, non-dormant seeds off. atratus did hardly germinate at high temperatures and lacked a gap sensitivity based on temperature fluctuation. Since the temperature amplitude decreases beneath an insulating cover of vegetation or water, seeds seem to be prepared for rapid germination at open, wet, maybe even inundated sites. Late-summer-dispersed seeds of G. officinalis were in a state of conditional primary dormancy. Dormancy could be completely broken by cold-wet stratification, indicating spring germination. Similar to J. atratus, daily temperature fluctuations did not control germination at suitable microsites. In Cnidium dubium that occurs at higher elevated sites, the level of primary dormancy of seeds was sufficient to prevent germination following dispersal, but the level was dependent on the year of harvest. Buried seeds showed an annual dormancy/conditional dormancy cycle. Dormancy was only partially broken by cold-wet stratification. It was completely broken by application of a high concentration of gibberellic acid. C. dubium had no absolute light requirement for germination, but it was stimulated by high light levels and in contrast to the other two species, seeds were stimulated by daily temperature fluctuations. Germination would therefore be maximized by zaps in early spring when the flooding water has receded. Re-entering dormancy in the late spring fails to support that germination occurs immediately after early-summer mowing - an important factor at subcontinental flood meadows. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

Intercropping may become more important in a world that needs to produce 60-70% more food by 2050 with limited land and other agricultural resources. To assess the role of intercropping in agricultural systems and its contribution to future food security, an intercrop model is needed for growth and yield predictions of intercrops under different growing conditions. Strip intercropping is a prevalent intercropping system, but the existing intercrop models are generally built for full mixtures and are less suitable for strip intercrops. Here we describe a simple intercrop model which is developed based on a sole crop model using the radiation use efficiency (RUE) concept and a strip intercrop light partitioning module. The model allows simulating the growth and yield of each intercropped species in relay-strip intercropping under potential growing conditions (only competition for light; other resources are assumed to be non-limiting), and the intercrop could vary in species combination, planting configuration, sowing densities and sowing dates. The daily inputs of the model are temperature and radiation, and crop-specific parameters are required to simulate crop leaf area index (LAI), biomass and final yield. Data collected during two years (2013 and 2014) field experiments were used to calibrate and test the model. The experiments consisted of two sole crop treatments (sole wheat, SW and sole maize, SM) and three intercrop treatments (replacement intercrop, 6:2WM and add row intercrops, 8:2WM and 6:3WM). The experiments were conducted in Wageningen, the Netherlands. Data of sole crops (SW and SM) and replacement intercrop (6:2WM) treatment were used to calibrate the model, and data of add-row intercrops (8:2WM and 6:3WM) were used to test the model. Bayesian analysis was applied to calibrate RUE of wheat and maize in sole crops and intercrop. This calibration procedure resulted in posterior distributions of RUE for sole crops and intercrop, on the basis of which distributions of biomass and land equivalent ratio (LER) were simulated. Biomass accumulation and yield of each species were simulated adequately but LAI was slightly overestimated compared to observations. The intercrop model allows simulating the contribution of border row effects to the productivity of inter crops. It combines a simple structure with easy calibration and enables growth and yield simulations for a wide range of relay-strip intercrops. The model thus can be of value in exploratory land use studies to assess the role of intercropping. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have demonstrated that supplemental blue (B) and red (R) wavelengths from LEDs impact plant development, physiology, and morphology. High-pressure sodium (HPS) lighting systems are commonly used in greenhouse production, but LEDs have gained popularity in recent years because of their improved energy efficiency and spectral control. Research is needed to determine the efficacy of supplementary B and R LED narrowband wavelengths compared with traditional lighting systems like HPS in terms of yield, quality, and energy consumption for a variety of greenhouse-grown high-value specialty crops. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of LED and HPS lighting on greenhouse hydroponic basil (Ocimum basilicum var. 'Genovese') biomass production and edible tissue nutrient concentrations across different growing seasons. Basil was chosen because of its high demand and value among restaurants and professional chefs. A total of eight treatments were used: one nonsupplemented natural light (NL) control; one HPS treatment; and six LED treatments (peaked at 447 nm/627 nm, +/- 20 nm) with progressive B/R ratios (10B/90R; 20B/80R; 30B/70R; 40B/60R; 50B/50R; and 60B/40R). Each supplemented light (SL) treatment provided 8.64 mol.m(-2).d(-1) (100 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), 24 h.d(-1)). The daily light integral (DLI) of the NL control averaged 9.5 mol. m(-2).d(-1) across all growing seasons (ranging from 4 to 18 mol.m(-2) .d(-1)). Relative humidity averaged 50%, with day/night temperatures averaging 27.4 degrees C/21.8 degrees C, respectively. LED treatments had the greatest total fresh biomass (FM) and dry biomass (DM) accumulation; biomass for LED treatments were 1.3 times greater on average than HPS, and 2 times greater than the NL control. Biomass partitioning revealed that the LED treatments had more FM and DM for the individual main stem, shoots, and leaves of each plant at varying levels. LED treatments resulted in greater height and main stem diameter. Some essential nutrient concentrations were impacted by SL treatments and growing season. An energy analysis revealed that on average, narrowband B/R LED treatments were 3 times more energy efficient at increasing biomass over HPS. LED treatments reduced SL energy cost per gram FM increase by 95% to 98% when compared with HPS. In addition, the rate of electricity consumption to biomass increase varied across LED treatments, which demonstrates that basil uses different B/R narrowband ratios at varying efficiencies. This experiment shows that spectral quality of both supplemental sources and natural sunlight impacts primary metabolic resource partitioning of basil. The application of LED lighting systems to supplement natural DLI and spectra during unfavorable growing seasons has the potential to increase overall biomass accumulation and nutrient concentrations in a variety of high-value specialty crops.",,,,,"Hammock, Hunter/GRF-1561-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-5345,2327-9834,,,,DEC,2020,55,12,,,,,1888,1897,,10.21273/HORTSCI15267-20,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI15267-20,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000595638300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The simulation results indicate a dependence of condensation water mass on the apparent contact angle of the substrate, but almost in no relation with the surface temperature. The condensation water mass firstly increases with the increase of the apparent contact angle. It reaches a maximum weight of 522 g/m(2) at an apparent contact angle of 110 degrees, and then decreases. A visualization experiment of condensation on a radiant ceiling panel with a conventional aluminum alloy surface was performed in a climate chamber to measure the departure duration of the droplet. The measured departure duration fluctuates due to the variance of apparent contact angle and the randomness of condensation process, but it decreases sharply with the sub-cooled degree (air dew point minus surface temperature). And the average departure duration is 10 h with a sub-cooled degree of 5 degrees C. The theoretical model is validated as the average relative biases between the experimental and theoretical results are within 25%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the establishment of suspended clam culture in Suttsu fishing port, Hokkaido. Cages accommodating 100 clams (mean shell length 28 mm) were suspended in the stocking area at the back of the port and the fairway area at the center of the port. Rearing periods were November 2017-October 2018 in the former and November 2018-October 2019 in the latter. Shell length was measured every month; water temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, and flow velocity around cages were measured regularly. The mean shell length at the end of the experiments was 34 mm in the stocking area and 41 mm in the fairway. Although the water temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, and advective components of flow velocity did not differ between the sites, the fluctuating component of flow velocity was higher in the fairway than in the stocking area. This suggests the former is more suitable for clam growth than the latter in terms of food supply.

Variation in aboveground light conditions, however, is important to soil-dwelling animals that are periodically active on the soil surface. A prime example is the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris L. (the dew-worm), an ecosystem engineer that emerges nocturnally on the soil surface. In the summer, the northernmost populations of L terrestris are exposed to a time interval with no daily dark period. During a two-week period preceding the summer solstice, we studied the constraints that boreal night illumination imposes on L terrestris surface activity by comparing their behaviour under ambient light with artificially-induced darkness. Looking for evidence of geographical divergence in light response, we compared the behaviour of native L terrestris (Joldoinen, S W Finland; 60 degrees 48'N) with two markedly more southern populations, from Preston (Lancashire, UK; 53 degrees 47'N) and Coshocton (Ohio, USA; 40 degrees 22'N) where the nights have a period of darkness throughout the year (total latitudinal range ca. 2300 km). Under ambient light conditions, L terrestris emergence on the soil surface was diminished by half compared with the darkened treatment and it peaked at the darkest period of the night. Also mating rate decreased considerably under ambient light. The native dew-worms were generally the most active under ambient light. They emerged earlier in the evening and ceased their activity later in the morning than dew-worms from the two more southerly populations. The differences in behaviour were, however, significant mainly between native and UK dew-worms. In the darkened treatment, the behaviour of the three earthworm origins did not differ. Under the experimental conditions light condition was the dominant environmental factor controlling surface activity, but elevated night-time air temperature and humidity also encouraged dew-worm emergence without discernible differences among geographical origins. Our results show, that in boreal summer, the high level of night illumination strongly limits soil-surface activity of dew-worms. Considering the important regulatory role of L terrestris in many ecosystem processes, this can have significant corollaries in dew-worm impacts on the environment. Although evidence for geographical differentiation in behaviour was obtained, the results point to phenotypic flexibility in L. terrestris light response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing winter temperatures and wide temperature fluctuations are leading to more frequent rain-on-snow events and freeze-thaw cycles causing snow compaction and formation of ice layers in the snowpack, thus creating ice encasement (IE). By decreasing the snowpack insulation capacity and restricting soil-atmosphere gas exchange, modification of the snow properties may lead to colder soil but also to hypoxia and accumulation of trace gases in the subnivean environment. To test the effects of these overwintering conditions changes on plant winter survival and growth, we established a snow manipulation experiment in a coniferous forest in Northern Finland with Norway spruce and Scots pine seedlings. In addition to ambient conditions and prevention of IE, we applied three snow manipulation levels: IE created by artificial rain-on-snow events, snow compaction and complete snow removal. Snow removal led to deeper soil frost during winter, but no clear effect of IE or snow compaction done in early winter was observed on soil temperature. Hypoxia and accumulation of CO2 were highest in the IE plots but, more importantly, the duration of CO2 concentration above 5% was 17 days in IE plots compared to 0 days in ambient plots. IE was the most damaging winter condition for both species, decreasing the proportion of healthy seedlings by 47% for spruce and 76% for pine compared to ambient conditions. Seedlings in all three treatments tended to grow less than seedlings in ambient conditions but only IE had a significant effect on spruce growth. Our results demonstrate a negative impact of winter climate change on boreal forest regeneration and productivity.

The regression analysis yielded information on the start and finish of a colony's daily activity cycle, hive weight change at night, hive weight loss due to departing foragers and weight gain due to returning foragers. Assumptions about the meaning of the timing and size of the morning weight changes were tested in a third study by delaying the forager departure times from one to three hours using screen entrance gates. A regression of planned vs. observed departure delays showed that the initial hive weight loss around dawn was largely due to foragers. In a similar experiment in Australia, hive weight loss due to departing foragers in the morning was correlated with net bee traffic (difference between the number of departing bees and the number of arriving bees) and from those data the payload of the arriving bees was estimated to be 0.02 g. The piecewise regression approach was then used to analyze a fifth study involving hives with and without access to natural forage. The analysis showed that, during a commercial pollination event, hives with previous access to forage had a significantly higher rate of weight gain as the foragers returned in the afternoon, and, in the weeks after the pollination event, a significantly higher rate of weight loss in the morning, as foragers departed. This combination of continuous weight data and piecewise regression proved effective in detecting treatment differences in foraging activity that other methods failed to detect.",,,,,"McFrederick, Quinn/AAD-2858-2019; Colin, Theotime/AAW-7734-2020; Meikle, William/AAC-2481-2022","Colin, Theotime/0000-0003-0223-4479; Holst, Niels/0000-0002-8414-6773; Barron, Andrew/0000-0002-8135-6628; McFrederick, Quinn/0000-0003-0740-6954; Meikle, William/0000-0002-1759-6950",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,MAY 23,2018,13,5,,,,,,,e0197589,10.1371/journal.pone.0197589,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197589,,,,,,,,29791462,,,,,WOS:000433077000043,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ambient temperature has a profound effect on this balance, with species inhabiting colder climates often needing to invest more energy in thermoregulation to maintain body temperature. This leads to local behavioral and physiological adaptations that increase energetic efficiency. In this study, we investigated the role of activity, behavior and thermogenic capacity in the ability of the greater white-toothed shrew, Crocidura russula, to cope with seasonal changes. Individuals were captured in the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, a Mediterranean region, and separated into three experimental groups: a control group, acclimated to a 12L:12D photoperiod and temperature of 18-20 degrees C; a winter group, acclimatized to natural winter fluctuations of light and temperature; and a summer group, acclimatized to natural summer fluctuations of light and temperature. No differences were found in resting metabolic rate and nonshivering thermogenesis between the three groups. However, winter shrews significantly reduced their activity, particularly at night, compared to the control and summer groups. Differences in torpor use were also found between groups, with winter shrews entering torpor more frequently and during shorter periods of time than summer and control shrews. Our results indicate C russula from Sintra relies on the flexibility of energy saving mechanisms, namely daily activity level and torpor use, to cope with seasonal changes in a Mediterranean climate, rather than mechanisms involving body heat production.

Cultivars differing in maturity characteristics were sown in spring at a range of dates in three replicated plot experiments and were used to compare the effects of two plastic mulches and an untreated control: one plastic mulch completely covered the rows (floating); the other had holes punched in the plastic, through which the plants grew (punch). Between April and October 1996 and 1997, the Ontario heat units (OU) received were abr,vc average at 2489 and 2660 respectively; in those years without plastic mulches, the earliest maturing cultivar, Melody, yielded 11.0 and 13.6 t DM ha(-1), with dry-matter contents of 214 and 215 g kg(-1) respectively. Mean daily increases in soil and air temperature under plastic mulches of up to 6 degrees C and 11 degrees C, respectively, were closely related to solar radiation. Under plastic mulches, 15% fewer OU were required to reach silking, and 33% more OU were available between silking and harvest. Meaned over three experiments, two years and three cultivars, plastic mulches, when compared with the unmulched control, increased maize yield from 12.0 lo 14.7 t DM ha(-1), cob yield from 3.7 to 6.8 t DM ha(-1), dry matter content from 230 to 270 br kg(-1) and starch content from 198 to 272 g kg(-1). The effect of plastic mulch on the maturation of the crop was greatest at earlier sowings.

In addition, climate change is likely to have significant effects on the hydrology and water resources of the GBM basin and may ultimately lead to more serious floods in Bangladesh. However, the assessment of climate change impacts on the basin-scale hydrology by using wellcalibrated hydrologic modeling has seldom been conducted in the GBM basin due to the lack of observed data for calibration and validation. In this study, a macroscale hydrologic model H08 has been applied over the basin at a relatively fine grid resolution (10 km) by integrating the fine-resolution DEM (digital elevation model) data for accurate river networks delineation. The model has been calibrated via the analysis of model parameter sensitivity and validated based on long-term observed daily streamflow data. The impacts of climate change (considering a high-emissions path) on runoff, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture are assessed by using five CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) GCMs (global circulation models) through three time-slice experiments; the present-day (1979-2003), the near-future (2015-2039), and the far-future (2075-2099) periods. Results show that, by the end of 21st century, (a) the entire GBM basin is projected to be warmed by similar to 4.3 degrees C; (b) the changes of mean precipitation (runoff) are projected to be + 16.3% (+ 16.2 %), + 19.8% (+ 33.1 %), and + 29.6% (+ 39.7 %) in the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Meghna, respe+tively; and (+) evapotranspiration is proje+ted to in+rease for the entire GBM (Brahmaputra: + 16.4 %, Ganges: + 13.6 %, Meghna: + 12.9 %) due to increased net radiation as well as warmer temperature. Future +hanges of hydrologic variables are larger in the dry season (November-April) than in the wet season (May-October). Amongst the three basins, the Meghna shows the highest increase in runoff, indicating higher possibility of flood occurrence. The uncertainty due to the specification of key model parameters in model predictions is found to be low for estimated runoff, evapotranspiration and net radiation. However, the uncertainty in estimated soil moisture is rather large with the coefficient of variation ranging from 14.4 to 31% among the three basins.",,,,,"Yeh, Pat J.-F./AAH-3042-2020; Masood, Muhammad/GQG-8789-2022; Hanasaki, Naota/C-2932-2009; YEH, Pat J. -F./B-2758-2011","Yeh, Pat J.-F./0000-0001-7629-3362; Masood, Muhammad/0000-0002-4627-1784; Hanasaki, Naota/0000-0002-5092-7563; YEH, Pat J. -F./0000-0001-7629-3362",,,,,,,,,,,,,1027-5606,1607-7938,,,,,2015,19,2,,,,,747,770,,10.5194/hess-19-747-2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-19-747-2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000350557400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Six isonitrogenous (43% crude protein) and isoenergetic (20 U g(-1)) diets replacing 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75% FM protein by MBM protein were formulated. Each diet was randomly allocated to triplicate groups of fish in sea floating cages (1.0 x 1.0 x 1.5 m), and each cage was stocked with 180 fish (initial average weight of 1.88 +/- 0.02 g). Fish were fed twice daily (05:00 and 17:30) to apparent satiation for 8 weeks. The water temperature ranged from 26.5 to 32.5 degrees C, salinity from 32 to 36 parts per thousand, and dissolved oxygen content was approximately 7 mg 1(-1) during the experimental period. Survival decreased with increasing dietary MBM and the survival in the fish fed the diet with 75% protein from MBM was significantly lower than other groups (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in specific growth rate (SGR) among the fish fed the diets with 0 (the control group), 15, 30 and 45% protein from MBM. However, SGR in the fish fed the diets with 60 and 75% protein from MBM were significantly lower than other groups (P < 0.05). No significant differences in feeding rate were observed among dietary treatments. The digestibility experiment showed that the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of dry matter, protein, lipid and energy of MBM were significantly lower compared with those of FM (P < 0.05). Essential amino acid index was found to be correlated positively with SGR in the present study, suggesting that essential amino acid balance was important. Body composition analysis showed that the carcass protein and essential amino acids were not significantly affected by dietary MBM. The lipid and n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acid (n-3 HUFA) in fish muscle, however, significantly decreased with increasing dietary MBM. These results showed that 45% of FM protein could be replaced by MBM protein in diets of large yellow croaker without significantly reducing growth. It was suggested that the reduced growth with higher MBM was due to lower digestibility and imbalance of essential amino acids. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Efficient breeding for chilling tolerance is hampered by both the complex physiological response of maize to chilling temperatures and the difficulty to accurately measure chilling tolerance in the field under fluctuating climatic conditions. For this research, we used genome-wide association (GWA) mapping to identify genes underlying chilling tolerance under both controlled and field conditions in a broad germplasm collection of 375 maize inbred lines genotyped with 56110 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We identified 19 highly significant association signals explaining between 5.7 and 52.5% of the phenotypic variance observed for early growth and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. The allelic effect of several SNPs identified for early growth was associated with temperature and incident radiation. Candidate genes involved in ethylene signalling, brassinolide, and lignin biosynthesis were found in their vicinity.

The objective of this study was to compare the performance of two wick irrigation systems using self- compensating troughs filled with either pine bark ( WPB) or coconut coir ( WCC) with nutrient film technique ( NFT) hydroponic system for greenhouse lettuce production. The daily monitoring of electrical conductivity ( EC) and pH allowed the experiment management according to the recommended values for optimal lettuce growth. The EC showed variation among troughs and salt accumulation in substrates, with WPB exhibiting two times greater EC than WCC ( ranging from 0.95 to 7.57 and from 0.68 to 3.67 dS. m(-1), respectively), while the pH values were stable over time. The WCC promoted greater root length and shoot diameter, while WPB produced shorter plants compared to the other two treatments. NFT resulted in an 83% lower leaf area and 44% lower root volume than WPB and WCC. The fresh and dry shoot masses with NFT were 58% and 24% lower than with WPB and WCC, respectively. The fresh root mass was also reduced in NFT plants, which was 67% smaller than WCC and 59% smaller than WPB. Root dry mass of NFT was 35% lower than the average of WPB and WCC.

The EC and nutrient concentration in the substrates increased over time. The wick irrigation system with both substrates resulted in higher productivity than NFT, with higher yield and plant quality in WCC, indicating its feasibility as an alternative system for lettuce production in greenhouses.

We studied the common intertidal rockweed Fuctis gardneri to determine how stress and herbivory interact to influence its survival, growth, reproduction, and the concentration of phlorotannins, which can deter herbivory and constitute substantial mass. We manipulated stress and herbivory both in the field and in outdoor mesocosms over 2-4 months during spring and summer. In the field, disruptive stress was reduced in the upper range of the seaweed's distribution with awnings made of screen. Temperatures and relative humidities were more extreme in the no-awnings locations. This treatment was crossed with a limpet-removal treatment. In mesocosms, the tidal period was controlled so that half of the experimental thalli were exposed to air daily for 3-4 hours longer (greater limitation stress) than the other half, and three levels of isopod grazing were maintained. Grazing intensity was effectively reduced in the field and increased in the mesocosms. Net rates of photosynthesis were used as independent measures of seaweed stress. Fucus gardneri in the locations without awnings exhibited significant reductions in net photosynthesis, survival, and final size compared to thalli under awnings. The mesocosm environment was more benign; all individuals survived longer and grew larger. However, results from both experiments were generally consistent. Stress resulted in slightly lower growth and substantially reduced phlorotannin mass. Severe stress had a negative effect on reproductive output in the field experiment, but mild stress had a small positive effect in the mesocosms. Herbivory resulted in reduced thallus mass, slightly reduced growth, and reduced reproduction, but it had no effect on phlorotannin levels in either experiment. Herbivory and stress thus influenced different performance indicators in Fucus. Stress had more dramatic effects on phlorotannins than it did on growth, whereas herbivory more strongly influenced growth and reproduction. Few interactive effects were found, unlike in many terrestrial studies. If stress and herbivory act largely independently, as they appear to do here and in the limited number of other seaweed studies, predicting the effects of changes in the intertidal physical environment and in herbivory might be simpler than anticipated. The physiological basis for the observed responses to stress and herbivory is suspected to involve trade-offs in resource allocation among these key life-history parameters.",,,,,,"Dethier, Megan/0000-0001-8900-0522",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,,,AUG,2005,75,3,,,,,403,418,,10.1890/03-4108,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-4108,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000230655200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, high individual animal variability in rumen pH and the difference in measurement methods for pH data acquisition decrease the sensitivity and accuracy of pH indicators for detecting SARA in ruminants. The aim of this study was to refine rumen pH indicators in long-term SARA based on individual dairy cow reticulo-rumen pH kinetics. Animal performances and rumen parameters were studied weekly in order to validate SARA syndrome and rumen pH was continuously measured using reticulo-rumen sensors. In total, 11 primiparous dairy cows were consecutively fed two different diets for 12 successive weeks: a control diet as low-starch diet (LSD; 13% starch for 4 weeks in period 1), an acidotic diet as high-starch diet (HSD; 32% starch for 4 weeks in period 2), and again the LSD diet (3 weeks in period 3). There was a 1-week dietary transition between LSD and HSD. Commonly used absolute SARA pH indicators such as daily average, area under the curve (AUC) and time spent below pH < 5.8 and pH < 6 were processed from absolute (raw) daily kinetics. Then signal processing was applied to raw pH values in order to calculate relative pH indicators by filtering and normalizing data to remove inter-individual variability, sensor drift and sensor noise. Normalized AUC, times spent below NpH < -0.3 and NpH < -0.5, NpH range and NpH standard deviation were calculated. Those relative pH indicators were compared with commonly used pH indicators to assess their ability to detect SARA. This syndrome induced by HSD was confirmed by consistent expected changes in milk quality, dry matter intake and acetate : propionate ratio in the rumen, whereas the ruminal concentration of lipopolysaccharide was increased. Commonly used pH SARA indicators were not able to discriminate SARA syndrome due to high animal variability and sensor drift and noise, whereas relative pH indicators developed in this study appeared more relevant for SARA detection as assessed by receiver operating characteristic tests. This work shows that absolute pH kinetics should be corrected for drift, noise and animal variability to produce relative pH indicators that are more robust for SARA detection. These relative pH indicators could be more relevant for identifying affected animals in a herd and also for comparing SARA risk among studies.",,,,,"Silberberg, Mathieu/X-9974-2019; martin, cécile/F-9543-2019","Silberberg, Mathieu/0000-0003-3345-8088; MARTIN, cecile/0000-0002-2265-2048",,,,,,,,,,,,,1751-7311,1751-732X,,,,MAR,2018,12,3,,,,,481,490,,10.1017/S1751731117001677,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1751731117001677,,,,,,,,28747243,,,,,WOS:000435643000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seed germination of Persicaria hydropiper (L.) Spach, Persicaria lapathifolia (L.) S.F.

After both experiments (temperature x salinity and desiccation), the algal photosynthetic performance was measured through chlorophyll fluorescence parameters using a pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometer to test their stress response. Palisada perforata likely underwent stress by desiccation due to tidal fluctuations rather than to temperature or salinity changes. This conclusion agrees with our observations of the plateau site ' s specimens, which were exposed to both air and UV radiation during low tides and exhibited higher antioxidant activity to avoid oxidative damage.

In this study, we present global positioning system (GPS), gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) and follow-on (FO) observations obtained during the 2002-2020 period to identify hydrological changes on the TP. The spatial long-term trends in the GRACE/GRACE-FO data show continuous glacier mass losses around the Himalayas and accumulated mass on the inner TP due to the increased water mass in lakes. The singular spectrum analysis (SSA) was applied for interpolation of the data gap with GRACE/GRACE-FO. We evaluated the correlation between the vertical displacements obtained from 214 continuous GPS stations and GRACE/GRACE-FO-modeled water mass loads and found a high correlation, with spatial variabilities associated with the seasonal terrestrial water storage (TWS) pattern. The common-mode component obtained from continuous GPS coordinates was decomposed using principal component analysis (PCA) and presented different periodic signals related to interannual fluctuations in hydrology and the dynamics of the inner Earth. Moreover, the various characteristics of precipitation and temperature revealed similar interannual fluctuations to those of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. We conclude that the GPS-inferred interannual fluctuations and the corresponding GRACE/GRACE-FO-modeled hydrological loads reflect climate responses.

Accompanied by the water re-use, metabolic end products of fish and bacteria continuously accumulate in RAS process water. Nitrate, which is an end-product of biological nitrification processes, accumulates to high concentrations potentially influencing various physiological parameters of fish. The present study focusses on the effects of different nitrate concentrations on performance and health status of on-growing European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). On-growing sea bass were exposed to four different nitrate-N (NO3- -N)concentrations (control (C): 0 mg L-1; low nitrate-N (LN): 125 mg L-1; medium nitrate-N (MN): 250 mg L-1; high nitrate-N (HN): 500 mg L-1) in a triplicate experimental design in twelve small-scaled RAS for 10 weeks. The nitrate concentrations were adjusted with a sodium nitrate and potassium chloride solution (Na+/ K+ weight-ratio of 1:27). Rising nitrate levels during the exposure period, caused by the accumulation of metabolic nitrate, were avoided by batch water exchange twice a week. Final biomass, final individual weight, condition factor (CF), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and spleen-somatic index (SSI) were not significantly affected by nitrate exposure within the concentration range tested. Specific growth rate (SGR), and total mortalities did not significantly differ between the treatment groups either, although a trend towards decreasing SGR and increasing mortalities at high nitrate levels was obvious. This study revealed, that the hepato-somatic index (HSI) and daily feed intake (DFI) were significantly negative correlated to with increasing nitrate levels.

The system allows automatic and simultaneous measurements of a complex set of plant physiological processes at leaf, branch, stem and root levels [transpiration (E), sap flow (F) and diameter fluctuations (Deltad)], in combination with the micrometeorological variables that control these processes [soil and air temperature (T-s and T-a), vapour pressure deficit of the air (D) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)]. A 2-d experimental period was used to study the whole-tree water transport dynamics of the young beech tree. Good correspondence between E of the leaves and F in the supporting branch was found. An increased time lag between the F measurements along the hydraulic pathway down towards the root system was observed, indicating the non-steady-state nature of the water flow. The daytime Deltad of stem and branch revealed the depletion and the replenishment of internal water reserves. The daily amount of water withdrawn from internal storage was 5% of the total daily transpiration. A good linear relationship was found between the rate of change in internal water storage and the rate of change in stem diameter, having no time lag.

This paper reports on the results of an original experiment in Sydney Australia in 2016 to evaluate seasonally the heat stress attenuation through green roofs and green walls. Data was collected from mid-summer 2016 (January) to early summer (November 2016) the following season. Two scaled-down structures representing a considerable percentage of housing stock were used to compare heat attenuation in a traditional design compared to a structure covered with a lightweight GRGW on two elevations. Importantly, the results inform our knowledge and understanding of the fluctuations in GRGW performance over an extended period. The combination of relative humidity and temperature plays an important role in establishing heat stress levels in terms of Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). The higher levels of WBGT occurred in summer, whereas the lower levels occurred in winter. The WBGT of both prototypes was similar during winter, showing no significant relevance of GRGW for heating an indoor environment. However, during the summer the vegetation had a major role in reducing WBGT. Heat stress is seasonally evaluated according to the percentage of the time, which the thresholds for different metabolic activities are reached. During warm conditions, GRGW attenuated heat stress and the associated health-related risks substantially. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison with internal wave theory shows the vertical and horizontal structure of the semidiurnal band horizontal current and temperature fluctuations to be consistent with a first baroclinic mode internal wave with a horizontal wavelength of 20-30 km. Over the continental shelf the semidurnal band temperature fluctuations show a phase shift which may be evidence of the influence of the subcritical bottom slope and/or the effects of bottom friction.

Tune series of the scalar irradiance (PAR), beam attenuation coefficient (at 660 nm), stimulated chlorophyll fluorescence, concentration of dissolved oxygen, and water temperature were subject o spectral analysis. The data were acquired in the Sargasso Sea at a depth of 23 m during the Biowatt mooring experiment in 1987. The cloudy days, on which power spectra of PAR exhibited distinct maxima at periods of about 40 to 190 min, were selected for the analysis. Similar variations occurred in beam attenuation, fluorescence and dissolved oxygen as evidenced by relatively high coherence (> 0.5) between PAR and these variables. This is suggested to be related to rapid photoadaptive responses in the phytoplankton community on time scales of minutes. Possible explanations for these responses include changes in fluorescence yield, photosynthetic rate, cellular absorption, cell size and refractive index. No relationship between PAR and the bio-optical parameters was observed when hydrodynamical factors prevailed over time scales similar to those for cloud-induced irradiance fluctuations.

We found that P. marinus cells were released on a diurnal cycle, with most cells released during the hottest and brightest period of the day (12:00-18:00). Temperature also had a strong and immediate effect on the number of cells released, but salinity did not, only influencing the intensity of infection over the course of several months. Taken together, our results demonstrate that (1) the number of parasites in the water column fluctuates according to a diurnal cycle, (2) temperature and salinity act on different timescales to influence parasite abundance, and (3) live infected oysters may substantially contribute to the abundance of transmissive parasites in the water column under particular environmental conditions.",,,,,,"Gignoux-Wolfsohn, Sarah/0000-0002-9037-1088",,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-1820,1469-8161,,,,APR,2021,148,5,,,,,532,538,,10.1017/S0031182020002383,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182020002383,,,,,,,,33353569,,,,,WOS:000627425700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Taub. is an early successional leguminous tree widely distributed in South America, often occurring as cultivated or naturalized trees, thus considered to be a good example for testing DD model in tree species. The main objective of this study was to describe the seed germination response of different populations of P. dubium as function of DD accumulation during germination assays in semi-controlled (fluctuating temperatures) conditions. Germination assays with manually scarified seeds sown in aluminum sheet trays filled with a composed substrate were performed under greenhouse conditions at different times. Three methods were employed in order to describe the accumulation of thermal time throughout the assays and, considering the seed lot and sowing time, a trapezoid area method was relatively more effective in describing the germination. The germination curves of P. dubium seeds from different populations, expressed in degree-days estimated directly from temperature records schedules, tend to be more clustered suggesting little variation among thermal time requirements in different seed provenances. Otherwise, the thermal time requirement can vary depending on the time of sowing, and any increase in DD requirement when the assays were performed under higher mean temperatures can be related to a thermal effect on the germination of scarified seeds.",,,,,,"Daibes, L.

In areas with limited rainfall and high temperature, mulching can provide greater yield of rain-fed soybean by improving soil hydro-thermal regimes. However, organic mulching like rice straw and shaded newspaper being inexpensive, rapidly degradable, easy to use, and environment friendly may provide more benefits than plastic mulching. Field experiments with rain-fed soybean cultivation were done in 2015 and 2016 at Gifu University farm in Japan. The purposes were to investigate the effects of rice straw and newspaper mulching on moisture and temperature regimes of soil, soil-water consumption (SWC), soil-moisture extraction pattern (SMEP), total readily available moisture (TRAM), water use efficiency (WUE) as well as growth and yield of soybean. Mulching increased seasonal soil-moisture content with lesser fluctuations in the root zone compared to bare soil, and lowered soil temperature by 2 degrees C at 5 cm and 0.5-1.0 degrees C at 15-25 cm soil depths. Straw mulch reduced SWC by 41.8 and 13.9% in 2015 and 2016, respectively compared to bare soil; the corresponding reduction in SWC under newspaper mulch was 16.6 and 20.6%. Consequently, mulching improved WUE by 25-47% compared to bare soil. Mulching significantly (p <= 0.05) improved plant height, leaf chlorophyll content, nodulations, grain (pod) and seed numbers, biomass, and grain and seed yields of soybean compared to bare soil. Grain yield increased by 12-13% under straw mulching and 6.6-37.2% under newspaper mulching compared to bare soil. Newspaper mulch provided higher yield and WUE by maintaining lower soil temperature and SWC, and greater soil moisture compared to straw mulch.

Our results document strong variability in surface water DMS concentrations along a repeated coastal-oceanic transect. DMS concentrations were consistently low (similar to 1-2 nM) in February, and increased to summertime mean values of similar to 8 nM. For both survey years, we observed higher DMS concentrations in near shore waters during early summer (June), but a reversal of this spatial gradient in August when the highest DMS concentrations were observed in open ocean regions. Sea-air DMS fluxes ranged from similar to 5 to 25 mu mol m(-2) day(-1) and did not show the consistent spatial and temporal patterns observed for surface water concentrations. Fine-scale spatial variability was present for both surface water concentrations and sea-air fluxes. Some of this variability could be attributed to underlying physical and biologically heterogeneity, including the presence of localized phytoplankton blooms at the coastal-oceanic transition boundary. Using a simple statistical approach, we estimate that the mean length scale of DMS variability along our sampling transects was <10 km, which was significantly shorter than that observed for physical variables (temperature and salinity), but somewhat larger than the variability length scale of chlorophyll a (chla). Using multiple linear regression analysis, we were unable to produce a single consistent empirical relationship predicting surface DMS concentrations from a suite of biological and hydrographic variables. However, DMS did show significant correlations with some variables including calcite, chlorophyll a and mixed layer depth (MLD). Mean DMS concentrations across cruises were related to chla/MLD ratios and the solar radiation dose, in a manner that was consistent with previously published algorithms. However. these algorithms failed to predict the mesoscale and sub-mesoscale variability along the cruise track. High frequency measurements of DMS during an extended occupation of Ocean Station Papa demonstrated large variability over periods ranging from similar to 12 to >24 h. This variability could not be explained by simple empirical analysis, but showed some correspondence with daily cycles of incoming solar irradiance. Simple calculations suggest that biological turnover was likely a significant source of temporal variability in DMS concentrations at Ocean Station P. Our observations demonstrate the importance of high-resolution measurement techniques in furthering our understanding of ocean DMS dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The treatments of WT and ST were designed from tillering to jointing and from jointing to booting with mean night temperature increased as 1.56-1.67 degrees C and 1.78-1.92 degrees C, respectively. The WT treatment significantly enhanced grain yield by increasing grain number and 1000-grains weight for both cultivars, while the ST treatment had less impact than WT treatment. Both warming treatments shortened pre-anthesis while elongated post-anthesis growth duration, which resulted in higher post-anthesis growth degree days (GDD). The WT treatment significantly enhanced pre-anthesis crop growth rate (CGR), biomass and leaf area index (LAI) at anthesis, but the ST treatment showed slight increase as compared with the controls. Furthermore, the WT treatment increased net photosynthetic rate (Pn), maximum photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m), actual photosynthetic efficiency (Phi(PSII)) and the contents of total soluble protein and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in flag leaves within 21 days after anthesis. These results indicate that winter night warming treatment promotes pre-anthesis plant growth, leaf development and improves post-anthesis photosynthetic capacity eventually resulting in increased grain yield while spring night warming shows less impact on grain yield.

Here, we investigate the temperature signals in field conditions that result in vernalisation, the mechanism by which flowering is aligned with spring. We find that multiple, distinct aspects of the temperature profile contribute to vernalisation. In autumn, transient cold temperatures promote transcriptional shutdown of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), independently of factors conferring epigenetic memory. As winter continues, expression of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3 (VIN3), a factor needed for epigenetic silencing, is upregulated by at least two independent thermosensory processes. One integrates long-term cold temperatures, while the other requires the absence of daily temperatures above 15 degrees C. The lack of spikes of high temperature, not just prolonged cold, is thus the major driver for vernalisation. Monitoring of peak daily temperature is an effective mechanism to judge seasonal progression, but is likely to have deleterious consequences for vernalisation as the climate becomes more variable.",,,,,"Antoniou-Kourounioti, Rea Laila/AAY-3284-2020; Howard, Martin/C-3629-2016","Antoniou-Kourounioti, Rea Laila/0000-0001-5226-521X; Bloomer, Rebecca/0000-0002-0902-1807; Berggren, Kristina/0000-0002-7859-9928; Collier Harris, Barley Rose/0000-0001-5745-1812; Howard, Martin/0000-0001-7670-0781; Dean, Caroline/0000-0002-6555-3525; Hepworth, Jo/0000-0002-4621-8414; Selga, Catja/0000-0001-8683-1291",,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-1723,,,,,FEB 12,2018,9,,,,,,,,639,10.1038/s41467-018-03065-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03065-7,,,,,,,,29434233,,,,,WOS:000424748700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

This process releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and is the main cause of soil carbon release in terrestrial ecosystems. Fluctuations in microbial composition significantly affect net CO2 emissions in forests. Because factors are cross-correlated, addressing how they affect soil respiration (Rs), both directly and indirectly, is challenging. In this study, Rs-impacting soil properties, including soil organic carbon (SOC), soil organic nitrogen (SON), microbial diversity (Dsim, indicated by Simpson's diversity index), and total microbial DNA concentration in natural beech forests were examined by structure equation modeling (SEM), which can explicitly evaluate the causal relationships among interacting variables. The results showed that decreasing Dsim, soil temperature, SOC, and SON clearly had direct and indirect effects on Rs under natural conditions. Increasing temperature was a primary factor and promoted a decrease in Rs during the growth season. Dsim was the only parameter with a direct positive effect on Rs, indicating that microbial diversity could accurately predict Rs. Soil nutrient factors indirectly affected Rs through Dsim, which was also affected by soil physical and chemical properties. Significant covariance between SON and Rs (0.42, p < 0.001) indicated multiple interacting variables affecting soil activity. Although the current study suggests that SEM can clarify complex functional processes related to Rs, future studies should consider additional impacting variables such as vegetation properties and enzyme dynamics.",,,,,"Wang, Quan/M-2011-2019; Wang, Quan/F-5424-2013","Wang, Quan/0000-0001-5483-0243",,,,,,,,,,,,,0912-3814,1440-1703,,,,SEP,2014,29,5,,,,,789,799,,10.1007/s11284-014-1158-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-014-1158-x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000342219200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is characterized by a twice daily habitat shift of the zooplankton species: staying in the epilimnion only during night time and migrating down in the crack of dawn in deeper water layers, staying there during the day time. This causes a discontinuous grazing regime and previous studies have shown that the direction and strength of phytoplankton community responses to zooplankton DVM most probably depends on the size of phytoplankton species. To examine the influence of zooplankton DVM on different sized phytoplankton communities, we designed an experiment where we manipulated the size distribution of a natural phytoplankton community a priori in field mesocosms. We investigated the influence of DVM of the cladoceran Daphnia hyalina on two different phytoplankton communities, by the use of deep (10 m) field enclosures. Epilimnetic lake water, containing a summer phytoplankton community, was filtered with two different mesh sizes (11 mu m and 64 mu m). The 11 mu m phytoplankton community (small) contained mainly small algal species, while the 64 mu m community (large) had a wider range of phytoplankton sizes. To simulate zooplankton DVM, D. hyalina were placed in mesh cages that were lowered or raised (migration) as dictated by the study design; a no migration (representing absence of DVM) treatment was also tested. Phytoplankton abundance was measured using chlorophyll-a and biovolume; size distribution of the algae and nutrient availability was also determined in each treatment. The results indicated that DVM had contrasting effects on the two evaluated phytoplankton communities. Comparison of migration'' and no migration zooplankton treatments showed that nutrient availability and total phytoplankton biovolume was higher in (I) no migration treatments with phytoplankton communities comprising mainly small algae and (2) migration treatments with phytoplankton communities of a broader size spectrum of algae. Hence our study showed two different mechanisms of zooplankton DVM may influence the phytoplankton community dynamics. Nutrient cycling was an important factor in phytoplankton communities of mainly small algae, whereas the refuge effect was the main driver of phytoplankton dynamics in phytoplankton communities of a large size spectrum of algae",,,,,"Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013","Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1129-5767,1723-8633,,,,,2012,71,1,,,,,125,134,,10.4081/jlimnol.2012.e13,http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2012.e13,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000303943400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Phase 2 of the Distributed Model lntercomparison Project (DMIP 2) was formulated primarily as a mechanism to help guide the U.S. NWS as it expands its use of spatially distributed watershed models for operational river, flash flood, and water resources forecasting. The overall purpose of DMIP 2 was to test many distributed models forced by high quality operational data with a view towards meeting NWS operational forecasting needs. At the same time, DMIP 2 was formulated as an experiment that could be leveraged by the broader scientific community as a platform for the testing, evaluation, and improvement of distributed models. DMIP 2 contained experiments in two regions: in the DMIP 1 Oklahoma basins, and second, in two basins in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the western USA. This paper presents the overview and results of the DMIP 2 experiments conducted for the two Sierra Nevada basins. Simulations from five independent groups from France, Italy, Spain and the USA were analyzed. Experiments included comparison of lumped and distributed model streamflow simulations generated with uncalibrated and calibrated parameters, and simulations of snow water equivalent (SWE) at interior locations. As in other phases of DMIP, the participant simulations were evaluated against observed hourly streamflow and SWE data and compared with simulations provided by the NWS operational lumped model. A wide range of statistical measures are used to evaluate model performance on a run-period and event basis. Differences between uncalibrated and calibrated model simulations are assessed. Results indicate that in the two study basins, no single model performed best,in all cases. In addition, no distributed model was able to consistently outperform the lumped Model benchmark. However, one or more distributed models were able to outperform the lumped model benchmark in many of the analyses. Several calibrated distributed models achieved higher correlation and lower bias than the calibrated lumped benchmark in the calibration, validation, and combined periods. Evaluating a number of specific precipitation-runoff events, one calibrated distributed model was able to perform at a level equal to or better than the calibrated lumped model benchmark in terms of event-averaged peak and runoff volume error. However, three distributed models were able to provide improved peak timing compared to the lumped benchmark. Taken together, calibrated distributed models provided specific improvements over the lumped benchmark in 24% of the model-basin pairs for peak flow, 12% of the model-basin pairs for event runoff volume, and 41% of the model-basin pairs for peak timing. Model calibration improved the performance statistics of nearly all models (lumped and distributed). Analysis of several precipitation/runoff events indicates that distributed models may more accurately model the dynamics of the rain/snow line (and resulting hydrologic conditions) compared to the lumped benchmark model. Analysis of SWE simulations shows that better results were achieved at higher elevation observation sites. Although the performance of distributed models was mixed compared to the lumped benchmark, all calibrated models performed well compared to results in the DMIP 2 Oklahoma basins in terms of run period correlation and %Bias, and event-averaged peak and runoff error. This finding is noteworthy considering that these Sierra Nevada basins have complications such as orographically-enhanced precipitation, snow accumulation and melt, rain on snow events, and highly variable topography. Looking at these findings and those from the previous DMIP experiments, it is clear that at this point in their evolution, distributed models have the potential to provide valuable information on specific flood events that could complement lumped model simulations.

Swarm clusters collectively modulate their morphology in response to these variations (i.e. expanding/ contracting in response to heating/cooling) to maintain their internal temperature within a tolerable range and to avoid exhausting their honey stores prematurely. To understand the spatiotemporal aspects of thermoregulatory morphing, we measured the change in size, shape and internal temperature profiles of swarm clusters in response to dynamic temperature ramp perturbations. Swarm clusters showed a two-fold variation in their volume/density when heated from 15 degrees C to 30 degrees C. However, they did not reach an equilibrium size or shape when held at 30 degrees C for 5 h, long after the core temperature of the cluster had stabilized. Furthermore, the changes in cluster shape and size were hysteretic, contracting in response to cooling faster than expanding in response to heating. Although the base contact diameter of the cluster increased continuously when the swarm was heated, the change in length of the swarm (base to tip) over time was nonmonotonic. Consequently, the aspect ratio of the swarm fluctuated continuously even when held at a constant temperature. Taken together, our results quantify the hysteretic and anisotropic morphological responses of swarm clusters to ambient temperature variations while suggesting that both mechanical constraints and heat transfer govern their thermoregulatory morphodynamics.",,,,,,"Peters, Jacob/0000-0003-1826-3282; Peleg, Orit/0000-0001-9481-7967",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAR,2022,225,5,,,,,,,jeb242234,10.1242/jeb.242234,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.242234,,,,,,,,34931657,,,,,WOS:000770808300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, combined effects of drift macroalgae and warming on the occurrence and intensity of hypoxia are not well understood, although these anthropogenic stressors have co-occurred. We conducted 10 seasonally replicated 7-day algal enclosure/exclosure experiments at a shallow coastal zone in the eutrophic Nakaumi Lagoon, western Japan, to evaluate the combined effects of drift algae and water warming on occurrence and intensity of diel-cycling hypoxia. Experimental units were 1x1m plots of the sandy bottom fenced within 1m height with plastic mesh that excluded or included drift algae, with automated dissolved oxygen (DO) sensors deployed at the sediment surface. DO fluctuated over a diel cycle for both algal treatments, and algal presence and elevated temperature additively amplified the diel DO cycle. Algal presence and elevated temperature synergistically increased the occurrence and intensity of diel-cycling hypoxia. The occurrence of hypoxia, including anoxia, increased non-linearly in the presence of algae when mean water temperature exceeded similar to 25 degrees C, whereas such drastic increase in the hypoxia occurrence was not observed in the absence of algae. Furthermore, the daily minimum DO declined more steeply with warming under algal presence than the absence of algae. These results suggest that coastal areas in the lagoon are now seriously threatened by simultaneous progressions of eutrophication linking to algal bloom and global warming.",,,,,"Yamada, Katsumasa/AAA-1303-2020","Yamada, Katsumasa/0000-0003-2136-0366; MIYAMOTO, Yasushi/0000-0002-3753-436X; Nakano, Tadashi/0000-0001-8833-4301",,,,,,,,,,,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,MAR,2019,42,2,,,,,494,503,,10.1007/s12237-018-0484-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-018-0484-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000457728500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is often unclear whether the synergic effects of temperature, phytoplankton phenology and metabolic demands of fish support these prediction within and across regions. In this study, we combine experimentally-derived rates of larval survival in relation to water temperature with satellite remote-sensing estimates of chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature to predict habitat quality of first feeding Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) larvae in two adjacent large marine ecosystems; southeast Bering Sea (BS) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Predictions are made from 1998 to 2019, a period comprised of both warm and cool springs, followed by a series of extreme warming events (heatwaves) beginning in 2014. Model results indicate that the drivers of a mismatch between cod larvae and their food is fundamentally different between the two systems. In the GOA, larval habitat suitability is highly dependent on interannual fluctuations in sea surface temperature that regulate yolk reserves in embryos. In contrast, larval habitat suitability in the BS was more sensitive to the onset of the surface expression of Chl a production. The combined effects of changes in timing of Chl a and increased metabolic demands of larvae were captured by the model during the GOA marine heatwave (2014-16, 2019), which predicted significant loss of larval habitat across the entire region.

J,"Elberling, B",,,,"Elberling, B",,,Seasonal trends of Soil CO2 dynamics in a soil subject to freezing,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Seasonal trends and controls of soil CO2 concentrations are important for understanding soil carbon cycling, soil acidification and CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. This is particularly the case for cold region soils, since these hold extensive soil carbon reserves and are often subject to fluctuating environmental conditions. This paper evaluates and simulates seasonal trends and controls of subsurface CO2 dynamics at a tundra-heath site in NE-Greenland. The study consisted of field measurements of soil CO2 efflux. temperature, water content, pore gas composition in soil profiles as well as temperature- and moisture-con trolled laboratory experiments. Diurnal and seasonal variations in observed CO2 effluxes correlated fairly well with near-surface temperatures (r(2) > 0.8) except during periods where soil CO2 efflux was dominated by CO2 being released in burst due to rapid near-surface thawing or major precipitation events. Lack of correlation in these situations is considered a result of non-steady state conditions. Laboratory experiments on soil samples collected from four horizons revealed that the effect of temperature and water content on soil microbial respiration can be modelled by simple fit equations which explained 95% of the variation in observed soil CO2 effluxes during the 2001 growing season. Using observations of the water content and subsurface CO2 concentration with depth and time it was possible to predict the depth-dependent CO2 production using a steady state diffusion model (PROFILE). The resulting simulated CO2 production profile and soil CO2 effluxes agreed with observations and revealed the importance of CO2 diffusion for understanding subsurface soil CO2 dynamics. In addition, seasonal rates of soil CO2 production were predicted using the verified fit equations and observed soil temperatures and water contents.

During winter, hibernators divert PUFAs from oxidation, retaining them in their tissues and membranes, to ensure proper body functions at low body temperature. PUFAs are also precursors of eicosanoids with pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. This study investigated seasonal changes in eicosanoid metabolism of free-ranging brown bears (Ursus arctos). By using a lipidomic approach, we assessed (1) levels of specific omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids involved in the eicosanoid cascade and (2) concentrations of eicosanoids in skeletal muscle and blood plasma of winter hibernating and summer active bears. We observed significant seasonal changes in the specific omega-3 and omega-6 precursors. We also found significant seasonal alterations of eicosanoid levels in both tissues. Concentrations of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, such as thromboxane B2, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), and 15-HETE and 18-HETE, were significantly lower in muscle and/or plasma of hibernating bears compared to summer-active animals. Further, plasma and muscle levels of 5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET), as well as muscle concentration of 8,9-EET, tended to be lower in bears during winter hibernation vs. summer. We also found lower plasma levels of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, such as 15dPGJ(2) and PGE(3), in bears during winter hibernation. Despite of the limited changes in omega-3 and omega-6 precursors, plasma and muscle concentrations of the products of all pathways decreased significantly, or remained unchanged, independent of their pro- or anti-inflammatory properties. These findings suggest that hibernation in bears is associated with a depressed state of the eicosanoid cascade.",,,,,"Lefai, Etienne/L-7961-2019; Bertile, Fabrice/F-1287-2019; Lefai, Etienne/E-9615-2019; , simon/B-2895-2011; Evans, Alina/AAH-8881-2019; Carmen, Team1/Y-7382-2019; Giroud, Sylvain/AAG-6430-2019; Bertile, Fabrice/ABE-1479-2020; Swenson, Jon/AAE-2890-2019","Lefai, Etienne/0000-0002-3042-7801; Bertile, Fabrice/0000-0001-5510-4868; Lefai, Etienne/0000-0002-3042-7801; , simon/0000-0002-7820-3233; Carmen, Team1/0000-0003-4234-1746; Giroud, Sylvain/0000-0001-6621-7462; Bertile, Fabrice/0000-0001-5510-4868; Lab, Carmen/0000-0002-5935-3236; Tascher, Georg/0000-0002-5907-3947",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-1042,1432-1904,,,,OCT,2018,105,9-10,,,,,,,58,10.1007/s00114-018-1583-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-018-1583-8,,,,,,,,30291454,,,,,WOS:000446551000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The anthropogenic fraction is then used to evaluate the additional warming by analysis of its spectral contribution to the outgoing long-wavelength radiation (OLR) measured by infrared spectrometers embarked in satellites looking down. The anthropogenic CO2 additional warming extrapolated in 2100 is found lower than 0.1 degrees C in the absence of feedbacks. The global temperature data are fitted with an oscillation of period 60 years added to a linear contribution. The data which support the 60-year cycle are summarized, in particular sea surface temperatures and sea level rise measured either by tide gauge or by satellite altimetry.

Turbulent eddies interacting with evaporating surfaces often induce localized and intermittent evaporative and sensible heat fluxes that leave distinct thermal signatures. These surface thermal fluctuations observable by infrared thermography (IRT) offer a means for characterization of overlaying turbulent airflows and remote quantification of surface wetness. We developed a theoretical and experimental methodology for using rapid IR surface temperature measurements to deduce surface wetness and evaporative fluxes from smooth bare soils. The mechanistic model provides theoretical links between surface thermal fluctuations, soil, and aerodynamic properties enabling thermal inferences of soil wetness with explicit consideration of soil thermal capacity and airflow turbulence effects. The method potentially improves accuracy of soil wetness assessment by IRT-based techniques whose performance is strongly influenced by surface-turbulence interactions and offers new ways for quantifying fluxes directly at their origin.",,,,,"Haghighi, Erfan/J-3450-2013; Or, Dani/D-8768-2012","Haghighi, Erfan/0000-0002-8358-5619; Or, Dani/0000-0002-3236-2933",,,,,,,,,,,,,0094-8276,1944-8007,,,,JUL 16,2015,42,13,,,,,5325,5336,,10.1002/2015GL064354,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL064354,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000358691300031,View Full Record in Web of Science

Changes in population hydrotime parameters during after-ripening were used to model primary dormancy loss. Lithospermum arvense seeds were dry-stored at constant temperatures of 5, 15, 24 and 30 degrees C for 180 days. After different storage periods, seeds were incubated at 10 degrees C at a range of water potentials (0 to) -1.2 MPa). Experimentally obtained cumulative-germination curves were analysed by repeated probit regressions to obtain seed population hydrotime parameters. The population mean base water potential (Psi(b)(50)) showed a progressive decrease as after-ripening time progressed and the dormancy release rate was positively related to storage temperature. The hydrotime constant (theta(H)) and the SD of the base water potential (sigma(Psi b)) were unaffected by after-ripening time or storage temperature. To account for the effect of after-ripening time and temperature on dormancy release, an after-ripening thermal-time model was developed. The model consisted of the description of Psi(b)(50) changes as a function of an after-ripening thermal-time index (theta(AT)). An exponential decay function accurately described (R(2) = 0.92) the decrease pattern of Psi(b)(50) as function of theta(AT). Model evaluation under fluctuating soil water regimes showed a good correlation between observed and predicted data (r = 0.94 and 0.96). This indicated that the after-ripening process could be adequately described as a thermal-time response, further suggesting the potential applicability of the model to predict L. arvense emergence in the field.",,,,,"Chantre, Guillermo Rubén/F-1094-2010","Chantre, Guillermo Rubén/0000-0002-4424-0204",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1737,,,,,JUN,2010,50,3,,,,,218,227,,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2010.00770.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.2010.00770.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000277420100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The detailed turbulent characteristics are measured by a backscatter-type two-component LDV, a PIV system, a fine thermocouple and a cold-wire probe. In the reverse-flow region on the leeward side of the hill, the turbulence intensities and the Reynolds shear stress show much larger values than in a canonical wall-bounded shear flow. The mean temperature maintains a relatively high value below the location where the horizontal mean velocity rapidly decreases. At the outer edge of the reverse-flow region, there exists a second maximum intensity of temperature fluctuations. The instantaneous temperature waveforms near the heated surface show very large amplitude consisting of high-frequency fluctuations superimposed on the low-frequency motions. Simultaneous measurement of velocity and temperature is also done using a combination of a two-component LDV and a fine-wire thermocouple together with digital response compensation. In the downstream region of the hill, the horizontal and vertical turbulent heat fluxes become maximum at the hill-top height, and tend to diffuse in the vertical direction. On the other hand, in the reverse-flow region formed behind the hill, both of the heat fluxes decrease remarkably. In particular, it is worth noting that the horizontal turbulent heat flux near the surface becomes opposite in sign to that in the forward flow region. This is mainly due to the reversal of the mean flow direction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1386-6184,1573-1987,,,,OCT,2009,83,3,,,SI,,389,406,,10.1007/s10494-009-9227-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10494-009-9227-x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000270449100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study was carried out at the experimental farm of the University of Bari, where a greenhouse was arranged with a heating system connected to a ground-source heat pump (GSHP), which had to cover the thermal energy request. The experimental results of this survey highlight the capability of the geothermal heat source to ensue thermal conditions suitable for cultivation in greenhouses even if the compressor inside the heat pump have operated continuously in a fluctuating state without ever reaching the steady condition. Probably, to increase the performance of the heat pump and then its coefficient of performance within GSHP systems for heating greenhouses, it is important to analyse and maximise the power conductivity of the greenhouse heating system, before to design an expensive borehole ground exchanger.

Results indicate that the winter snow cover on sea ice in the Weddell Sea is extremely variable. Extreme fluctuations in Antarctic synoptic conditions (air temperature, precipitation; humidity, and wind speed) occur during the austral winter. They result in unique modifications and additions to the snow layer during the aging process and act to stabilize an otherwise easily wind-redistributed shallow snow cover and develop well-packed drift features. The latter occur even over relatively undeformed areas of sea ice and have a significant localized effect on the snow thickness distribution. Significant variability in snow grain size (mean 2.73 +/- 3.12 mm) and density (0.32 +/- 0.09 g cm(-3)) is observed as a result of cyclical switches between high- and low-temperature gradient metamorphism. Multiple icy layers indicate multiple thaw-freeze events. One such event occurred during a 3-day station, during which the air temperature rose by 22 degrees C in 12 hours (to approximately 0 degrees C). This paper also examines mechanisms for flooding of the snow-ice interface, including snow loading.

Turret construction was studied in a laboratory colony, addressing the question whether turrets are simply heaps of disposed soil, or result from the import and a particular spatial arrangement of materials. The colony was daily offered different building materials, i.e., clay, coarse and fine sands, which workers collected and deposited around a nest opening to construct a turret. After 10 days, the spatial arrangement of the different building materials, offered either simultaneously or consecutively in independent experiments, was characterized via thin sections and micromorphological analysis of the turret's walls. Workers did not select particular materials to be imported for turret building, but were selective in their spatial distribution and assembly into the turret structure. Particular types of microstructures were observed depending on the available materials, such as simple piles of sands, porous fabrics only composed of clay pellets, or fabrics with clay and sands combined. Turrets were very dynamic structures: while most imported materials were initially piled up at the shortest distance from the source, a marked subsequent material redistribution occurred as the turret grew, resulting in a new, mixed structure. Material re-assembly was particular evident when clay and sands were offered consecutively: a remarkable tendency to construct microstructures combining both materials was observed, i.e., clays were mobilized and included in sandy walls, and sands were intercalated in much compact clay walls. Irrespective of the materials used, walls showed a marked regular porosity in the range 50-60%, with the exception of secondary galleries that occasionally permeated the turret structure, which evinced lower porosity and therefore a more compact microstructure. Ants appeared to respond to local variations in the structural stability of the construction, since clay coatings smoothed and reinforced the surface of unstable sandy gallery walls. The observed building responses appear to be aimed at the maintenance of a porous yet mechanically-stable structure. The attained turret porosity may represent a compromise between high structural stability and low construction costs because of savings in material import.",,,,,,"Roces, Flavio/0000-0001-9258-3079",,,,,,,,,,,,,0892-7553,1572-8889,,,,MAY,2012,25,3,,,,,222,241,,10.1007/s10905-011-9290-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10905-011-9290-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000301789900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Selection experiments have shown that purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, populations have adaptive genetic variation for surviving pH conditions at the edge (pH 7.5) of conditions experienced in nature. However, little is known about whether populations have genetic variation for surviving low-pH events beyond those currently experienced in nature or how variation in pH conditions affects organismal and genetic responses. Here, we quantified survival, growth, and allele frequency shifts in experimentally selected developing purple sea urchin larvae in static and variable conditions at three pH levels: pH 8.1 (control), pH 7.5 (edge-of-range), and pH 7.0 (extreme). Variable treatments recovered body size relative to static treatments, but resulted in higher mortality, suggesting a potential tradeoff between survival and growth under pH stress. However, within each pH level, allele frequency changes were overlapping between static and variable conditions, suggesting a shared genetic basis underlying survival to mean pH regardless of variability. In contrast, genetic responses to pH 7.5 (edge) versus pH 7.0 (extreme) conditions were distinct, indicating a unique genetic basis of survival. In addition, loci under selection were more likely to be in exonic regions than regulatory, indicating that selection targeted protein-coding variation. Loci under selection in variable pH 7.5 conditions, more similar to conditions periodically experienced in nature, performed functions related to lipid biosynthesis and metabolism, while loci under selection in static pH 7.0 conditions performed functions related to transmembrane and mitochondrial processes. While these results are promising in that purple sea urchin populations possess genetic variation for surviving extreme pH conditions not currently experienced in nature, they caution that increased acidification does not result in a linear response but elicits unique physiological stresses and survival mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,AUG,2020,60,2,,,,,318,331,,10.1093/icb/icaa072,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icaa072,,,,,,,,32544238,,,,,WOS:000582722400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most farms are distributed along the Mediterranean Sea coast and in the hot internal valleys. According to the Israeli Herd,book the average annual milk production, per cow in 2008 was 11,460 kg, with 3.7% fat and 3.2% protein. Israel's climate is considered subtropical dry or Mediterranean, characterized by warm and dry summer with day temperatures above 30 C and relative humidity ranging from 50 to 90%. Climatic limitations brought dairy farmers to develop and implement new technologies and management practices that would enable high milk production and reproduction in summers. In the last three decades the Ministry of Agriculture research units, the extension service and dairy farmers conducted a series of trials and surveys in order to develop an efficient cooling system that will obtain and maintain high milk yield and good reproduction during the hot and humid summer. The cooling system commonly used in Israel is based on a combination of frequent direct watering of the cows, followed by forced ventilation air blowing onto the cows. The system was developed in Israel nearly 30 years ago. A typical cycle is five minutes long and consists of 30 sec of watering followed by 4.5 min of forced ventilation. Providing the cows with 5-7 cooling sessions per day, 30-45 min each, allowed cows, producing 25-30 kg of milk per day to maintain their body temperature below 39.0 C, throughout the day time, on a typical Israeli summer day. At the same time, non-cooled cows had high body temperatures (above 39.5 C), during some part of the daytime and returned to normal body temperatures (below 39.0 Q, only for a few hours late at night. In an experiment conducted in 1985-86, conception rate (CR) of cows, cooled as described above, was significantly higher than of non-cooled cows (59 vs. 17% and 57 vs. 17%), for first insemination and for all inseminations, respectively. Pregnancy rate (the amount of pregnant cows out of the eligible cows in the herd) calculated for 90, 120 and 150 days after calving differed significantly between the groups, (44, 59 and 73% vs., 5, 11 and 11%), in cooled and non-cooled cows, respectively. CR and pregnancy rates obtained in intensively cooled herds in this experiment were similar to those obtained during the winter of that year, in commercial dairy farms in Israel. Differently from the results described above, when cows in summer were intensively cooled, only for a period of 2 days before and 8 days after A.I, CR failed to improve (31 and 36%), in cooled and non-cooled cows, respectively. These results offer a conclusion that cows must be intensively cooled and must maintain normal body temperatures during the entire day and during the whole summer. i.e. the entire reproductive process from follicular development until implantation of the embryo in the uterus, in order to express cow's full reproductive potential in Israeli summer conditions. The effect of cooling intensity on cow's productive and reproductive traits was studied in a wide survey, during four consecutive years (1998-2001), on 14 farms, averaging 300 milking cows each, all located in the coastal plain of Israel. Farms were categorized into three different groups according to the intensity of summer cooling. Intensive (7.5 cumulative cooling hours per day), Moderate (4.5 cumulative hours per day) and No-cooling at all. CR was 56, 53 and 54%, and 40,34 and 15%, for primiparous (P<0. 01) and 47,46 and 43%, and 34,34 and 17% for multiparos cows (P<0.01), in the intensive, moderate, and no cooling groups, in winter and summer, respectively. In another survey based on the Israeli Herd Book data from 2005, using elite yielding herds (with average annual milk production per cow of more than 13,000 kg), the average CR of intensive cooled herds was 39 and 19%, in winter and summer respectively, compared to 39 and 12%, respectively, in non-cooled high yielding herds (P<0.01). This indicates that intensive cooling in summer can reduce by half the summer drop in CR, even in very high yielding herds. The Ministry of Agriculture extension service, in cooperation with the Israel Cattle Breeders Association (ICBA), developed a computerized report called Summer to Winter (S:W) Performance Ratio, based on the Israeli Herd book data from more than 300 herds. The higher the ratio is for productive and reproductive traits, the better a farm handles summer negative effects on cow's performance. Based on the S:W ratio of each herd in 2007, we quantified the overall effect of intensive cooling in summer on the cow's whole year performance. Data from 24 farms with the highest S:W ratio were compared with data from 24 farms with the lowest S:W ratio. The comparison showed that well cooled cows in Israeli summer added approximately 700 kg of milk to cow's lactation, an increase of 6.5% in its annual production. Summer CR were significantly higher in the highest S:W ratio farms, compared with the lowest ones (27 vs. 19%), and compared to those obtained in same groups in winter (40 vs. 36%), respectively. High S: W ratio-herds reached in summer conception rate of 70% of their winter CR, compared to only 50% in the lowest S:W ratio farms inseminated in same period. Trials conducted in the last 10 years show clearly that intensive cooling of high yielding cows (above 45 kg daily) in summer cannot completely eliminate summer decline in CR (as was achieved two decades ago when daily production was less than 30 kg). These high yielding cows despite being intensively cooled could not maintain normal body temperature all day long. This fact brought Israeli researchers to look for hormonal treatments to improve cow's summer fertility, among them elevating post insemination blood progesterone, GnRH treatment at time of insemination to optimise insemination time, improvement of egg quality by elimination of aged follicles produced during heat stress and the use of timed AI and embryo transfer. Part of these treatments improved summer CR when combined with intensive cooling. Cooling Intensification combined with hormonal therapy, management and nutritional practices are expected to minimize the gap between summer and winter CR obtained in Israel in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0916-8818,,,,,JAN,2010,56,,,S,,,S36,S41,,10.1262/jrd.1056S36,http://dx.doi.org/10.1262/jrd.1056S36,,,,,,,,20629215,,,,,WOS:000275564900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The unknown temperature and moisture content of the plants and canopy air are represented by a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The transport of moisture and heat through the support structure, which includes insulation and soil layers, is defined in a series of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). After setting out the model, this article presents and discusses a set of numerical applications. First, a simplified system consisting of a brick wall covered with climbing vegetation is used to study the role of individual variables (e.g., wind speed, minimum stomatal internal leaf resistance, leaf area index, and short-wave extinction coefficient) on the hygrothermal behaviour of the green wall. Thereafter, more complex green wall systems comprising a bare concrete wall, mortar, cork-based insulation (ICB), soil and vegetation are used to evaluate the influence of the thermal insulation and substrate layers on the heat flux distribution over time at the interior surface of the wall, and on the evolution of the relative humidity, water content, and temperature throughout the cross section of the green wall. The numerical experiments proved that vegetation can effectively reduce exterior facade surface temperatures, heat flux through the building envelope and daily temperature fluctuations.",,,,,"Tadeu, Antonio/G-6358-2019","Tadeu, Antonio/0000-0003-2535-8458; Almeida, Joao/0000-0002-7084-882X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,AUG,2021,14,15,,,,,,,4422,10.3390/en14154422,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14154422,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000681821900001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Clark, MS; Peck, LS; Thyrring, J",,,,"Clark, Melody S.; Peck, Lloyd S.; Thyrring, Jakob",,,Resilience in Greenland intertidal Mytilus: The hidden stress defense,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"The Arctic is experiencing particularly rapid rates of warming, consequently invasive boreal species are now able to survive the less extreme Arctic winter temperatures. Whilst persistence of intertidal and terrestrial species in the Arctic is primarily determined by their ability to tolerate the freezing winters, air temperatures in the Arctic summer can reach 36 degrees C in the intertidal, which is beyond the upper thermal limits of many marine species. This is normally lethal for the conspicuous ecosystem engineer Mytilus edulis. Transcriptomic analyses were undertaken on both in situ collected and experimentally warmed animals to understand whether M. edulis is able to tolerate these very high summer temperatures. Surprisingly there was no significant enrichment for Gene Ontology terms (GO) when comparing the inner and outer fjord intertidal animals with outer fjord subtidal (control) animals, representing animals collected at 27 degrees C, 19 degrees C and 3 T respectively. This lack of differentiation indicated a wide acclimation ability in this species. Conversely, significant enrichment for processes such as signal transduction, cytoskeleton and cellular protein modification was identified in the expression profiles of the 22 degrees C and 32 degrees C experimentally heated animals. This difference in gene expression between in situ collected and experimentally warmed animals was almost certainly due to the former being acclimated to a fluctuating, but predictable, temperature regime, which has increased their thermal tolerances. Interestingly, there was no evidence for enrichment of the classical cellular stress response in any of the animals sampled. Identification of a massive expansion of the HSPA12 heat shock protein 70 kDa gene family presented the possibility of these genes acting as intertidal regulators underpinning thermal resilience. This expansion has resulted in a modified cellular stress response, as an evolutionary adaptation to the rigour of the invasive intertidal life style. Thus, M. edulis appear to have considerable capacity to withstand the current rates of Arctic warming, and the very large attendant thermal variation. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

J,"Cascone, S",,,,"Cascone, Stefano",,,The energy-efficient design of sustainable green roofs in Mediterranean climate: An experimental study,ENERGY AND BUILDINGS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Green roofs were proposed to broaden nature-based solutions within the perspective of the ecological transition for the built environment. In this paper, an innovative and sustainable green roof was designed to optimize the energy performance in Mediterranean area during summer season by means of local -available and recycled materials, thus reducing the environmental impacts. This new green roof technol-ogy consisted of recycled polyethylene granules from the regeneration of disused agricultural plastic films as drainage layer and a substrate made of local-sourced materials with high percentage of organic matter and it was compared to two traditional green roofs and to the existing roof. The energy-efficient design was based on the thermo-physical parameters of the green roof (surface temperatures, heat flows and volumetric water content) and of the building (surface temperature of the ceiling) and on the thermal dynamic parameters (decrement factor, time lag and cooling potential). In addition, these thermo-physical parameters were correlated to the Mediterranean climate during summer season. The result demonstrated that although the proposed green roof reached higher surface temperatures than commer-cial solutions, it maintained an almost constant volumetric water content, it reduced daily fluctuations between minimum and maximum temperatures, it resulted in lower thermal flow through the cross-section, it reduced the surface temperatures inside the building by about 2 degrees C compared to the traditional roof, thus decreasing the energy consumption for building cooling and greenhouse gas emissions, and it had better dynamic thermal performance than commercial green roofs. Once the energy-efficient design of the proposed green roof technology was proved, the sustainability and the life cycle performance of the recycled polyethylene was discussed, also considering the costs.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Reuse of water with algae may increase the food exploitation and hence reduce the costs. Post-larvae of great scallop (Pecten maximus) were studied in a commercial hatchery using a partial open and continuous feeding tank system. Three different water recirculation rates (67, 83 and 92%) were tried out in two experiments with post-larvae originating from three spawning groups of ages between 43 and 57 days post-spawn, 316-886 mu m shell-height and 1.1-9.6 mu g ash-free dry weight. The post-larvae were held in sieves in tanks of 2500 1 where a downwelling flow was maintained by airlifts. New water with a mix of monocultured algae was continuously added to the tanks at algal concentrations of 10 and 15 cells mu l(-1) in experiment 1 (groups 1 and 2) and 2 (group 3), respectively. The algal supply to each sieve was reduced along with increased recirculation rate, but was kept between 6 and 13 cells mu l(-1). Generally no significant differences in survival, growth or chemical content were found between the three recirculation rates, while few differences were found between and within groups. Large variation in survival was found between and within groups (1-81%). Highest survival was found in experiment 1, and where post-larvae from two settlements were used, the first settlement survived better than the second. The daily growth ranged from 15 to 62 mu m shell-height and from 0.3 to 2.6 mu g ash-free dry weight. The scallop post-larvae could well be reared at all three recirculation rates studied as an increase from 67 to 92% did not seem to affect the post-larval performance seriously. The algal supply, however, had to be compensated by an increasing number of cells (> 10 cells mu l(-1)) when increasing the recirculation rate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Fire has influenced the evolution of several aspects of the vegetation, including reproduction and life cycles. This study tested how fire by-products such as heat and smoke affect the germination of six species common to two Cerrado open physiognomies: wet grasslands and the campo sujo (grassland with scattered shrubs and dwarf trees). We subjected seeds collected in northern Brazil to heat shock and smoke treatments, both separately and combined, using different temperatures, exposure times, and smoke concentrations in aqueous solutions. High temperatures and smoke did not break seed dormancy nor stimulate germination of the Cerrado study species. However, seeds were not killed by high temperatures, indicating that they are fire-tolerant. Our findings differed from those of other fire-prone ecosystems (mostly of Mediterranean vegetation), where fire stimulates germination. Moreover, we provide important information regarding germination strategies of non-woody Cerrado plants, showing the importance of considering the tolerance of seeds to high temperatures when evaluating fire-related traits in fire-prone ecosystems.

Elevated nest temperatures could increase the incidence of embryonic mortality and/or maladaptive phenotypes. We investigated whether elevated nest temperatures reduce hatching success in tropical flatback turtles (Natator depressus) nesting in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. Egg incubation treatments began at 29.5 degrees C and progressively increased in temperature throughout incubation, up to maxima of 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 degrees C. Elevated nest temperatures did not reduce hatching success or hatchling body size relative to control temperatures (29.5 degrees C), but did speed up embryonic development. A combination of sudden exposure to high temperatures during the first 2 weeks of incubation (>36 degrees C for 48 h) and prolonged warming throughout incubation (from 29.5-35 degrees C) did not reduce hatching success. We also recorded an unusually high pivotal sex-determining temperature in this flatback turtle population relative to other sea turtle populations: an equal ratio of male and female hatchlings is produced at similar to 30.4 degrees C. This adaptation may allow some flatback turtle populations to continue producing large numbers of hatchlings of both sexes under the most extreme climate change scenarios. Some tropical populations of nesting flatbacks may possess important adaptations to high-temperature incubation environments, which are not found in more southerly temperate populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,OCT,2015,218,20,,,,,3330,3335,,10.1242/jeb.118778,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.118778,,,,,,,,26347558,,,,,WOS:000363451300023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Female growth and egg production are represented by 8 state variables (gut content, nutrient pool, structural body, oil sac, and 4 stages of oocyte maturation) which are regulated by physiological processes. Clutch size is set constant under continuous food conditions, but the spawning interval changes with food availability and temperature depending on the rate of oocyte maturation. Smaller clutches can occur when eggs are released under bad external conditions. Thus changing conditions can produce different clutch size distributions. For model validation, egg production experiments were conducted under different constant and fluctuating food concentrations and compared with model simulations. In the experiments, egg production was strongly affected by food fluctuation. In experiments with alternating feeding and starvation cycles integrated egg production was affected by mean food concentration during the experiment rather than by the frequency of the cycles. The model reproduces correctly the egg production rates and final body carbon of females kept in the different food regimes. It provides a dynamical explanation of physiological responses of the individual under short term food variation. When food becomes unavailable, the most advanced oocytes are released and egg production continues until the nutrient pool decreases below a minimal critical value. Thereafter, no eggs are laid. When food reappears, somatic growth resumes until structural body weight is restored, then oogenesis is fuelled. Experimental results were simulated correctly without using matter from the lipid pool.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,,,,,APR,1997,149,1-3,,,,,91,104,,10.3354/meps149091,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps149091,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XA14600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

All the data recording and blood sample collections were done twice (morning and evening) a day for a continuous seven days each for control and thermal exposed conditions. Values of physiological responses, peripheral temperatures, blood biochemical parameters, stress enzymes and plasma sodium, potassium levels in both Tharparkar and Karan Fries heifers showed a significant variation (P < 0.05) in the morning and evening. So a diurnal fluctuation of rectal temperature was observed in this experiment. Significant (P < 0.01) variation in all the above parameters was observed in both Tharparkar and Karan Fries heifers in control and heat exposed conditions. Feed intake decreased and water intake increased in the heat exposed condition in both the breeds. Values of physiological responses were lower in the morning and showed an increasing trend, reaching highest values in the afternoon. The changes in physiological parameters were greater in Karan Fries in comparison to Tharparkar heifers that expressed lower heat tolerance capacity in crossbred than indigenous cattle. The correlation coefficient showed a significant relationship among all the parameters studied. This finding suggests that it is important to standardize the time of sample collection in comparative studies, in which more discrete differences may be identified in physiological parameters.

If the injuries are not lethal, renewal of the immune-competent cells and soluble components of coelomic fluid and/or the regeneration of tail segments occurs. The aim of our investigations was to test the hypothesis that exposure of adult earthworms Eisenia andrei to cadmium-polluted soil at room temperature (RT) and/or low temperature (6 degrees C) have adverse effects on restoration of experimentally depleted coelomocytes or on regeneration of amputated posterior segments. Intact control earthworms and their experimental counterparts subjected to electrostimulation-induced coelomocyte depletion or surgical amputation of posterior segments were maintained either in control soil or in soil spiked with cadmium chloride (500 mg/kg air-dried soil) at RT or 6 degrees C. Four weeks after the beginning of experiments, cadmium accumulation in earthworm bodies was significantly lower at 6 degrees C than at room temperature. The numbers of restored cells and fluorophore contents were hardly affected by temperature or cadmium. However, cocoon production was reduced by cadmium and completely abolished at 6 degrees C and regeneration of amputated posterior segments was inhibited in cold but was enhanced by cadmium exposure at RT. Independently on the temperature, the 4-week cadmium exposure of adult earthworms was connected with significantly upregulated expression of Cd-metallothionein (but not of catalase, lysenin and phytochelatin) in coelomocytes.",,,,,"Gałuszka, Adrianna/AAQ-5050-2021; Klimek, Beata/AAO-3754-2020; Gałuszka, Adrianna/ABI-5883-2020","Rorat, Agnieszka/0000-0002-8120-7956; Vandenbulcke, Franck/0000-0002-9735-1784; Klimek, Beata/0000-0002-4664-283X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-0456,1878-1659,,,,DEC,2017,203,,,,,,39,50,,10.1016/j.cbpc.2017.10.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpc.2017.10.002,,,,,,,,29038073,,,,,WOS:000416496800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The genus Symbiodinium contains nine clades, some of which behave differently in response to strong light and/or temperature stresses, for example, clade D Symbiodinium are thermally tolerant. However, previous studies are based on corals present in the field, and it is possible that the corals used in previous experiments did not contain single Symbiodinium clades. For an accurate assessment of the effects of each Symbiodinium clade on host thermal stress resistance, monoclonal cultures of clades C1 and D were inoculated into aposymbiotic juvenile polyps. Photosynthetic efficiency (maximum quantum yield: F-v/F-m) showed a decline at 30 degrees C than at 25 degrees C in both clades. Symbiodinium clade C1 showed a consistently higher rETRmax with larger fluctuations than clade D, with a lower survival rate of juveniles during thermal stress treatment. Under strong light exposure, corals containing clade C1 showed a greater decline in F-v/F-m (-74%), compared to decline in corals associated with clade D (-50%) after 3 hours. This is the first study to assess stress tolerances of juvenile corals in association with the monoclonal Symbiodinium clades C and D, and our results indicated greater tolerance of corals associated with clade D to strong light (500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). However, it is difficult to determine the impact of high-temperature stress on coral-algae symbiosis from photosynthetic activity. At high temperatures, clade C1 Symbiodinium exhibited high photosynthetic activity, but host survival rates were higher in corals associated with clade D Symbiodinium. Since clade C1 has a relatively high photosynthetic activity under high temperatures, clade C1 symbiosis at high temperatures might have a negative impact on corals compared with clade D.",,,,,"Higuchi, Tomihiko/D-7118-2019; Higuchi, Tomihiko/AAW-6006-2020","Higuchi, Tomihiko/0000-0001-7324-5752; Higuchi, Tomihiko/0000-0001-7324-5752",,,,,,,,,,,,,1021-5506,1810-522X,,,,,2016,55,,,,,,,,19,10.6620/ZS.2016.55-19,http://dx.doi.org/10.6620/ZS.2016.55-19,,,,,,,,31966164,,,,,WOS:000399617200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

We tested mussel mortality in 30-day exposures to constant and fluctuating salinities at different temperatures in the laboratory. Test conditions simulated different seasons of the year and locations with increasing influence of marine waters in Rio de la Plata, Argentina. Significant mortality (31 % after 30 days) was observed at a constant salinity of 2 aEuro degrees, increasing to 45 and 57 % at 5 and 10 aEuro degrees, respectively. In contrast, considerably greater tolerances were observed when conditions in the experimental chamber fluctuated between salt water and fresh water. No significant mortality was observed in mussels exposed to a salinity cycle with abrupt salinity changes ranging 1-23 aEuro degrees (mean 2.68 aEuro degrees) over a month. Tolerance to this type of regime was unaffected by different temperatures within ambient ranges. Tests at constant salinity underestimate the tolerance of this and probably other freshwater nonindigenous species (NIS) to short-term saltwater exposures. Estuarine ports account for ca. 2/3 of non-marine ports globally, thus constituting donor and recipient hotspots for the spread of NIS propagules into continental aquatic ecosystems via shipping vectors. The tolerance of L. fortunei to estuarine conditions likely contributes to the species' remarkable invasive success.

Two hundred and sixty-four female Large White X Landrace pigs were assigned at 25 kg to one of four dietary lysine treatments (13(.)3 (L1); 11(.)4 (L2); 9(.)5 (D) and 7(.)6 L4) g/kg) and either seven or 13 pigs per pen (or 1(.)0 and 0(.)5 m(2) per pig, respectively). An additional treatment Of one pig per pen (2(.)0 m(2) per pig) was included to compare the responses of solitary- versus group-penned pigs. Animals were given ad libitum access to dietary treatments from a mean pen starting weight of 26(.)1 (s.e. 0(.)35) kg to a mean pen finishing weight of 63(.)4 (s.e. 0(.)61) kg live weight. There were no significant interactions between dietary lysine content and floor space per pig on food intake (FI), average daily growth rate (ADG), the amount of food per unit of gain (FCR) and the rate of protein retention (PR). Significant interactions were evident for body composition and the rate of lipid retention (LR). Over the weight range 25 to 40 kg there were significant differences in FI (P < 0(.)05) and FCR (P < 0(.)001) between dietary lysine treatments but most of these differences had disappeared over the 40 to 60 kg live weight. Individually penned animals had significantly higher (P < 0(.)05) FI and ADG than group-penned animals. However, there were no differences between seven and 13 pig per pen treatments. Stocking density had no effect on LR or body protein content but did cause a significant reduction in PR (P < 0(.)001) and an increase in body lipid content (P < 0(.)05) as the number of pigs per pen increased from seven to 13. Lysine requirements (expressed in g/day) therefore could be seen to be reduced with increasing stocking density. However, as lysine intake was reduced in group-penned animals, the reduced daily requirement does not necessarily warrant a reduction in the lysine content of the food. Feeding according to the requirements for maximum PR will still produce the best carcass and growth performance irrespective of the group size. The improvement in PR associated with higher dietary nutrient levels did not completely offset the adverse physiological effects of higher stocking density but may partly counteract the effect of reduced lysine intake. However, there were indications that feeding crowded pigs a lower dietary lysine concentration may not further reduce the already diminished protein (lysine) growth rate. An additional experiment was performed to test whether the number of feeder bins may have constrained food intake and therefore growth in group-penned animals. The results of this experiment showed that the number of bins had no significant effect on FI, ADG and FCR in group-penned pigs, and therefore a single feeder bin was not considered a constraining factor in pigs housed with limited floor space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1357-7298,,,,,DEC,2001,73,,3,,,,459,469,,10.1017/S1357729800058434,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1357729800058434,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000172620100012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective of this study was to evaluate soil tillage systems for tobacco crop and possibilities of changing the traditional system of tobacco cropping to improve the soil physical conditions and maintain high yield. In a randomized compete block design with three replicates, six tillage/management systems were studied: inverting tillage (IT); minimum tillage after fallow (MTf); minimum tillage after oat as cover crop (MTo); no-tillage without ridge (NT); no-tillage with ridge (NTr); and no-tillage with consolidated ridge (NTrc). The experiment was installed in a small, hilly watershed, located in southern Brazil, on a soil classified as Leptosol. The main physical properties evaluated were soil moisture measured with a time domain reflectometer in 0.00-0.06, 0.06-0.12 and 0.12-0.18 m soil layers, and soil temperature at 0.05 m depth measured with termopars, both during 87 days in the growth cycle; total porosity, macroporosity, microporosity, bulk density and soil water retention curve (WRC), in 0.00-0.06, 0.06-0.12, 0.12-0.18 and 0.18-0.24 m soil layers, 30 days after transplanting (DAT) and on 135 DAT, except for WRC, in 0.00-0.06 and 0.06-0.12 m soil layers; soil mechanical resistance to penetration; root distribution; nutrient availability in root zone; crop parameters leaf area, plant height, number of leaves and yield. Soil water retention was similar among tillage/management systems and soil layers, and decreased, approximately 50%, from soil saturation up to 33 kPa water tension. Soil moisture was longest within the range of available water of no-tillage (NTrc) and minimum (MTf and MTo) systems. Soil air-space was above the critical value (0.15 m(3) m(-3)) during most days throughout the tobacco cycle in the surface soil layer for all systems. NTrc, MTo, NT and NTr provided longest consecutive period (30, 20, 13 and 11 days, respectively) with airspace below the critical in deepest soil layer. Soil temperature amplitude during tobacco crop cycle was highest for MTo and lowest for NT. Soil temperature had greater variations in the first 55 DAT, while from 55 to 75 DAT, there was a reduction in thermal amplitude and daily temperature average for most systems, with the increase in soil moisture and crop shading. The tillage/management systems did not show differences in bulk density in the surface, but differed in subsurface soil layers, being higher in no-tillage systems, but not reach critical values. Macroporosity behaved similar to total porosity and inverse to bulk density. Soil penetration resistance increased with depth in no-tillage systems, down to approximately 0.20 m and reaching 3 MPa. In NT, soil PR of 3 MPa was reached before 0.15 m depth; in IT and MTf, soil RP was less than 2 MPa down to 0.15 m depth and close to 3 MPa in deeper depths. No-tillage systems had the shallowest root development, not exceeding the 0.18-m soil depth. Contents of K and P in the tobacco rhizosphere were high, but there was no clear relationship between plant size (small vs. large) with the nutrient content in the root zone. The MTo and no-tillage systems, except NTrc, had higher leaf area index compared with IT and MTf. At 63 DAT, NTrc had significantly lowest leaf area index. The systems with higher dry-mass (NTr) and stem length (MTo) also showed higher productivity. The greatest productivity per area was observed in tilled soil (IT, MTf and MTo), while lower productivity was observed for NT. Less tillage and more surface mulch contributed to soil physical quality improvement, while no tillage system reached some critical physical values, particularly in the deepest soil layer. Furthermore, tillage and ridging for tobacco cropping in shallow soil reduced the effect of some soil physical stressors to tobacco growth and development. Consequently, soil management systems with winter cover crop, ridging and reduced soil tillage increased flue-cured tobacco yield, even low effect of tillage and ridging occurred for leaves qualitative classification, cropped on shallow soils on steeplands.",,,,,"Reichert, José Miguel/F-8189-2012","Reichert, José Miguel/0000-0001-9943-2898; PELLEGRINI, ANDRE/0000-0002-8233-9061; Rodrigues, Miriam Fernanda/0000-0001-5026-7887",,,,,,,,,,,,,0926-6690,1872-633X,,,,FEB,2019,128,,,,,,512,526,,10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.11.037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.11.037,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000456899400060,View Full Record in Web of Science

The usefulness of pea seed inoculation grown in the given region should be assessed on the basis of these comparisons. Soil samples of 32 various areas used for farm purposes in the teritory of Bohemia and Moravia, soil samples were collected. (Tab. I gives the characteristics of soils and sites). Dried soil samples were used for inoculation (5 g/plant) of Pisum sativum. The test plants were studied for nodulation, total nitrogenase activity (TNA) and plant biomass output. Two strains of R. leguminosarum bv. viciae were compared, that is: highly efficient strain 128C30 (acquired from the company Nitragin Co. USA) and low efficient isolate 44 (Luzany, Czechoslovakia). The test plants were cultivated hydroponically in perlite and supplied with nutrient solution without nitrogen. The trial was performed in glasshouse under artificial additional illumination and average daily temperature ranging from 20 to 24-degrees-C and night temperature of 15 to 16-degrees-C and 16 hours of photoperiod. All studied parameters are summarized in Tab. II. After inoculation with soil samples, a sufficient number of nodules was formed in most cases, though their weight was mostly lower than that in the plants inoculated with the strain 128C30. TNA in the course of flower ranged from 11 to 91 % of highly efficient strain. Some soil samples exhibited the TNA values lower than in low-efficient isolate 44. The biomass output of plants ranged from 20 to 100 % of the control strain 128C30. In general sense, after final assessment of the trial, it can be said that the nodulation by native rhizobia Originated from different regions of Bohemia and their efficiently of atmospheric nitrogen fixation was affected by more factors. One of them may be an altitude of the site. TNA value was lower along with above-ground mass output in the plants inoculated soil of the regions of higher altitude (Sumava 530 m, Kolovec 450 m) in comparison with the plants inoculated with the soil from lower situated regions (Domamyslice 220 m, Detenice 280 m). This tendency may be associated with the fact that with higher altitudes, the soil quality is lower.The effect of an altitude cannot be generalized, as it can be seen on the example of soil from Becvary (230 m of altitude),where rhizobia were not of a high efficiency. Dowling, Broughton (1986) refer to soil properties as having a decisive effect on competitive and nodulation properties of rhizobia. After Mareckova (1983), low soil pH (3.5 to 5.3) may be one of the factors limiting the propagation of rhizobia in soil and their efficiency. This fact was manifested also in our trial, when in the case of acid soils from Kolovec (pH = 5.1) native rhizobia were of a low efficiency. At the same time it can be said that though soil conditions are adequate for native rhizobia and their amount in the soil is high, this fact cannot lead automatically to their high efficiency. Bottomley, Jenkins (1983) isolated a high number of strains R meliloti from uninoculated lucerne cultivated on the soils of Oregon (USA) and found that only a low per cent (12 %) is highly efficient in N2 fixation. In our experiments inoculation by native rhizobia led also to lower nitrogenase activity and above-ground mass output in comparison with the efficient strain R leguminosarum bv. viciae 128C30. Neither soils sufficiently supplied with nutrients nor with an optimum pH value (e.g. from Slusovice) apparently contained rhizobia of above-average efficiency. However, not even in the case of Dalesice 1, where inoculation of pea seed was carried out in 1988, increased efficiency of native rhizobia was not observed. Counts of rhizobia direct in soils was not found in this study, though in the case of soils from submontane regions of Sumava and Becvary 3 one may conclude from a feeble nodulation that these soils did not contain a sufficient number of rhizobia. In the other soil samples, however, nodulation of test plants was adequate, though the nodules were usually of lower weight and TNA that the efficient strain 128C30. This lower efficiency could be manifested also through reduced plant biomass output. In this view, inoculation preparations may be recommended for inoculation of pes seed from most of these soils. The preparations should contain highly efficient competitive strains. As experiments were performed in different regions of Bohemia and Moravia, the recommendation may be extended also to the whole territory of the Czech Republic. If highly efficient strains comprised in preparations will be also highly competitive, their application should bring a required fruit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0370-663X,,,,,,1992,38,6,,,,,475,482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JF28500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Physiologists have historically overcome this hurdle in the laboratory by using 'average' conditions, representative of the natural environment for any given animal. Temperature, in particular, has widespread impact on the physiology of animals, and it is becoming increasingly important to understand these effects as we face future climate challenges. The majority of research to date has focused on the expected global average increase in temperature; however, increases in climate variability are predicted to affect animals as much or more than climate warming. Physiological responses associated with the acclimation to a new stable temperature are distinct from those in thermally variable environments. Our goal is to highlight these physiological differences as they relate to both thermal acclimation and the 'fallacy of the average' or Jensen's inequality using theoretical models and novel empirical data.

The authors use a numerical model to simulate the observed time series of sea surface temperature for the period 1960-1989. Based on the results, experiments are conducted to determine the relative importance of heat flux and momentum forcing. Two dominant timescales for variability of SST are identified: a decadal timescale that is controlled by latent heat flux anomalies and is primarily responsible for SST anomalies off the equator and an equatorial mode with a timescale of 2-5 years that is dominated by dynamical processes. The interhemispheric gradient of anomalous SST (the SST dipole) is primarily linked to the former process and thus results from the gradual strengthening and weakening of the trade wind system of the two hemispheres.",,,,,"carton, james/C-4807-2009; da Silva, Arlindo/D-6301-2012","carton, james/0000-0003-0598-5198; da Silva, Arlindo/0000-0002-3381-4030",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,,,,,JUL,1996,26,7,,,,,1165,1175,,10.1175/1520-0485(1996)026<1165:DAISVI>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(1996)026<1165:DAISVI>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VB31700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evidence for this effect has long been provided by extensive flash photolysis investigations of liganded hemoproteins and more recently of the nonheme respiratory protein hemerythrin in hydro-organic solvents. Within a given protein conformational substate, an elementary reaction step is characterized by one single free energy barrier and by a first-order rate constant, k, which changes with temperature according to an Arrhenius law. At physiological temperature and low viscosity, ultrafast conformational relaxation causes efficient averaging of the reaction rates and the protein displays exponential kinetics with an average rate constant [k]. Under sufficiently general conditions, it can be shown that [k] also follows a simple Arrhenius law with 'effective' values of the pre-exponential factor A(eff) and activation enthalpy H(eff). It is found that A(eff) strongly depends on the overall shape of the rate constant distribution and that H(eff) actually corresponds to the lower limit of the enthalpy of activation, i.e. the value associated with the highest possible reaction rate. The underlying distribution of rate constants can be reconstructed from a set of experiments in which the kinetics depart from an exponential, i.e. at low temperature and high viscosity. The most probable distribution of exponentials consistent with the observed kinetics of the geminate recombinations of oxygen with photodissociated hemerythrin has been determined by using a new approach, known as the maximum entropy method. The results are consistent with a single pre-exponential value and a distributed enthalpy spectrum. As expected, H(eff) does not coincide either with the most probable nor with the average value of the enthalpy. The most salient findings are that the probability for any protein molecule to have an enthalpy of activation equal to the effective value H(eff) vanishes and that A(eff) differs by nearly three orders of magnitude from the true value A(o). Biochemical reaction rates are actually average values, since protein reactions are measured under physiological conditions, where conformational relaxation is always fast. Our understanding of the significance of A(eff) and H(eff) is therefore entirely dependent on the knowledge of the distribution function of the rate constants. In particular, enthalpy and entropy terms of similar reactions performed by different proteins cannot be compared as long as the distribution of the rate constants remains unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0014-2956,,,,,MAR 28,1991,196,3,,,,,591,598,,10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15854.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15854.x,,,,,,,,2013282,,,,,WOS:A1991FE89300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature and photoperiod were hypothesized to act as the proximal environmental cues inducing this population to produce dormant eggs, and the variation in the dormant egg responses of individual females was quantified. Some field-collected females produced some dormant eggs early in the spring (March and April), but most of the switch to dormant eggs occurred in late June. Short-term experiments showed that increased temperatures increased the percentage of dormant eggs produced, whereas increased length of day did not. Long-term experiments showed a different pattern from short-term experiments, indicating that duration of exposure to particular temperatures or photoperiods may influence dormant egg production. Under certain conditions, it appeared that nearly all copepods were capable of producing dormant eggs, although identical experimental conditions did not affect all individuals similarly. In several experiments that revealed a significant treatment effect, between 42% and 85% of the variance detected could be attributed to variation among individuals. Also, the fraction of individuals producing dormant eggs generally increased with increasing water temperature. In Narragansett Bay, A. hudsonica appears to produce dormant eggs primarily in response to increased water temperatures although an effect of photoperiod could not be ruled out. Furthermore, individual responses vary greatly. Appreciation of such variation in an important life history trait, such as embryonic dormancy, is important in understanding how this population may be adapted to its environment.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of temperature and salinity fluctuations on the population dynamics of the shore crab Carcinus maenas at the southern edge of its native range. To this end, a population dynamics model was developed based on experimental and literature data on the biology, ecology and physiology of the species. Results showed that the shore crab will be more affected by changes in temperature than in salinity. The parameter sensitivity analysis revealed that the larval phase of the species is the most sensitive stage of the shore crab life cycle. Three IPCC scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-8.5) were used to simulate the effects of temperature increase on the population of C. maenas in the near- (2040), mid- (2060), and long-term (2100). Two scenarios of drought conditions accompanied by the estimated salinity change were also simulated (10 % and 40 % drought). Results suggested that slight increases in temperature (up to 2 degrees C) lead to a strong increase on the density of C. maenas in the mid-term, while further temperature increases lead to a decline or local extinction of the shore crab population at the southern edge of its distribution range. Results indicated that a salinity increase in the estuary had a negative effect on the shore crab population.

However, these unstable environments are characterised by an internal heterogeneity and a large variation of a range of abiotic variables. We conducted a series of experiments in a comparative framework to assess the effect of a number of exogenous factors known to exhibit marked fluctuations in the lagoonal environment, i.e. temperature, salinity, water level and photoperiod, on larval emergence of two sympatric parasites, Cainocreadium labracis and Macvicaria obovata, which share the snail intermediate host, Gibbula adansonii, and a sit-and-wait downstream host-finding strategy. Our results demonstrated contrasting patterns and rates of larval emergence indicating an overall differential response of the two species to the variation of the environmental factors. Cercariae of M. obovata exhibited increased emergence rates at elevated temperature (with a sharp increase at 15 degrees C), decreased salinity (35-25 practical salinity units (psu)) and low water levels, whereas larval emergence of C. labracis was unaffected by the experimental variation in temperature and water level and showed decreased rates at decreased salinity levels (35-25 psu). The differential impact of the variable environmental conditions indicates the complexity of the patterns of exogenous control modifying parasite transmission and abundance in the lagoonal environment. Most importantly, the contrasting rhythms of larval emergence indicate endogenous control associated with the different transmission pathways of the two opecoelid digeneans.",,,,,"Kostadinova, Aneta/H-1488-2014; Holzer, Astrid Sibylle/E-2531-2011; Raga, Juan Antonio/L-7669-2014; Born-Torrijos, Ana/N-9126-2017","Holzer, Astrid Sibylle/0000-0002-4916-3172; Raga, Juan Antonio/0000-0003-2687-2539; Born-Torrijos, Ana/0000-0002-1258-3616; Kostadinova, Aneta/0000-0001-7070-4968",,,,,,,,,,,,,0932-0113,1432-1955,,,,FEB,2014,113,2,,,,,545,554,,10.1007/s00436-013-3686-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-013-3686-7,,,,,,,,24271151,,,,,WOS:000333028100012,View Full Record in Web of Science

When laboratory-reared females and males were transferred and maintained from the rearing temperature of 24 degreesC for 2 h to -6.5 degreesC approximately 5% survived. However, conditioning of both females and males for 2 h at various temperatures from 0 to 10 degreesC before their exposure for 2 h to -6.5 degreesC increased survival to 80 to 92%. A similar rapid cold hardening response in both females and males was also induced through gradual cooling of the flies at a rate of approximately 0.4 degreesC per min. The rapid increase in cold tolerance after prior conditioning of the flies to low temperatures, was rapidly lost when they returned to a higher temperature of 24 degreesC. In the field, in late February and early March, females and males were capable of a rapid cold hardening response. After exposure to the critical temperature they suffered a high mortality when tested in the afternoon and low mortality early in the morning on consecutive days, probably because of differences in the prevailing field temperatures a few hours before testing.

Assisted migration of adapted provenances mitigates drought impacts and promotes forest regeneration. Although suitable provenances are difficult to identify by traditional ecophysiological techniques, which are time consuming and invasive, plant water status can be easily assessed by infrared thermography. Thus, we examined the stress responses of 2-year-old potted Scots pine seedlings from six provenances (Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Spain) based on two thermal indices (crop water stress index and stomata' conductance index). Both indices were derived from infrared images during a 6-week drought/control treatment in a greenhouse in the summer of 2013. The pines were monitored during the stress and subsequent recovery period. After controlling for fluctuating environmental conditions, soil moisture or treatment-specific water supply was the most important driver of drought stress. The stress magnitude and response to soil water deficit depended on provenance. Under moderate drought conditions, pines from western and eastern Mediterranean provenances (Bulgaria, France, and Spain) expressed lower stress levels than those from both continental provenances (Germany and Poland). Moreover, pines from continental provenances were less resilient (showed less recovery after the stress period) than Mediterranean pines. Under extreme drought, all provenances were equally stressed with almost no significant differences in their thermal indices. Provenance-specific differences in drought resistance, which are associated with factors such as summer precipitation at the origin of Scots pine seedlings, may offer promising tracks of adaptation to future drought risks.",,,,,"Matiu, Michael/L-5637-2019; Menzel, Annette/B-1105-2013","Matiu, Michael/0000-0001-5289-0592; Menzel, Annette/0000-0002-7175-2512; Schunk, Christian/0000-0003-0605-3819",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-462X,,,,,AUG 31,2016,7,,,,,,,,1247,10.3389/fpls.2016.01247,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2016.01247,,,,,,,,27630643,,,,,WOS:000382282100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The intercept (alpha(i)) and slope (beta(i)) of these regressions increased linearly with temperature (T), implying that G = alpha(i)W(i)(beta), where alpha(i) = gamma(1) + delta(1)T and beta(i) = gamma(0) + delta(2)T. Nonlinear fit of the four-parameter model showed that gamma(1) was not significantly different from 0, and thus the following three-parameter model is suggested for the food-unlimited growth rate of cod ranging in size from 2 to 5000 g at any temperature from 2 to 16degreesC: G = (0.5735T)W(-0.1934-0.02001T). The results indicate that temperature in this size range has a much greater effect on the growth rate of small juvenile cod than on that of larger cod. The model predicts that the optimal temperature for growth of cod decreases with increased size of fish, from 14.3degreesC for 50-g fish to 5.9degreesC for 5000-g fish. Growth curves were derived for cod at constant and seasonally variable temperatures.

Annual fluctuations in the water level of the lakes and calculations of the annual variability of the water balance showed that the lakes accumulated almost four times less water from rainfall than expected. Furthermore, the temperature measured at a depth of 15 cm in the bottom sediments of Lake El Sol revealed an unexpected warming during the cold season. Estimated heat fluxes through the lake bottom were less than 0.3 W m(-2) during the winter and less than 0.1 W m(-2) during the rest of the year.

Endodormancy (dormancy induced by cold) was overcome with less than 330 chilling hours (CH) of constant cold in 'Castel Gala' and less than 618 CH in 'Royal Gala'. A daily 15 degrees C-temperature cycle did not affect the endodormancy process. Heat waves during endodormancy resulted in an increased CH to achieve bud requirements. The negative effect of high temperature depended on the lasting of this condition. Chilling was partly cancelled during dormancy when the heat wave lasted 36 continuous hours or more.

The wounds take weeks to heal and are painful to touch throughout this time. Possible strategies to hasten the healing of disbudding wounds are not well understood, but the type of iron used may be an important factor to consider. When evaluating strategies to hasten healing, a within-subjects design may be preferable, but laterality effects might act as a potential source of variation and confounding in this type of experiment. Our objectives were to compare healing after disbudding with 2 commercially available irons, and to determine whether wounds healed differently on the left versus the right side of the head. Ten Holstein calves 4 to 10 d of age were disbudded using the Rhinehart X50A electric disbudder (Rhinehart Development Corp., Spencerville, IN) on one horn bud and the Portasol gas disbudder (Portasol USA, Elmira, OR) on the of her; side (left vs. right) was balanced between treatments. We scored wounds daily for the presence of 6 tissue types: attached necrotic tissue, detached necrotic tissue, exudate, granulation, crust, and epithelium. Surface temperature and size of the wound were measured twice-weekly using thermal and digital photographs, respectively. The type of iron used did not affect latency to re-epithelialize, which took on average (mean + standard deviation) 53 + 3 d and 55 +/- 3 d for Portasol and Rhinehart wounds, respectively (range: 40-70 d). However, compared with Portasol wounds, those from the Rhinehart had fewer days of granulation tissue and tended to have more days of detached necrotic tissue. The Portasol tip had a smaller total surface area than the Rhinehart, which may have resulted in a less severe burn, causing the necrotic tissue to fall off sooner. The left side tended to re-epithelialize faster than the right side (mean +/- standard error: left 51 +/- 3 d; right 57 +/- 3 d) and have fewer days of crust. Left-sided wounds were also cooler and tended to be smaller than those on the right. To assess the external validity of these laterality effects in our primary experiment (experiment A), we analyzed wound healing data from 2 other disbudding studies, one on calves (experiment B) and one on goat kids (experiment C). We observed laterality effects in the opposite direction in Experiment B, but negligible effects in experiment C, indicating that the differences in laterality had low external validity; the biological meaning of this asymmetry is unclear. Nonetheless, if using a within-subjects design, asymmetries in wound healing should be considered to avoid confounding effects. In conclusion, wounds from both irons took 7 to 8 wk to heal, on average; other strategies to accelerate healing should be explored.",,,,,,"Tucker, Cassandra/0000-0002-6014-444X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0302,1525-3198,,,,NOV,2019,102,11,,,,,10163,10172,,10.3168/jds.2018-16121,http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-16121,,,,,,,,31155250,,,,,WOS:000489285000050,View Full Record in Web of Science

Part I: Amino acids,GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Of the factors which control the quantity and composition of organic matter (OM) buried in marine sediments, the links between infaunal ingestion and gut passage and sediment geochemistry have received relatively little attention. This study aimed to use feeding experiments and novel isotope tracing techniques to quantify amino acid net accumulation and loss during polychaete gut passage, and to link this to patterns of selective preservation and decay in sediments. Microcosms containing either Arenicola marina or Hediste (formerly Nereis) diversicolor were constructed from defaunated sediment and filtered estuarine water, and maintained under natural temperature and light conditions. They were fed with C-13-labelled diatoms daily for 8 days, and animals were transferred into fresh, un-labelled sediment after similar to 20 days. Samples of fauna, microcosm sediment and faecal matter were collected after 8, similar to 20 and similar to 40 days, and analysed for their bulk isotopic signatures and C-13-labelled amino acid compositions. Bulk isotopic data showed that, consistent with their feeding modes, Hediste assimilated added C-13 more quickly, and attained a higher labelling level than Arenicola. Both species retained the added C-13 in their biomass even after removal from the food. A principal component analysis of C-13-labelled amino acid mole percentages showed clear differences in composition between the algae, faunal tissues, and sediment plus faecal matter. Further, the two species of polychaete showed different compositions in their tissues. The amino acids phenylalanine, valine, leucine, iso-leucine, threonine and proline showed net accumulation in polychaete tissues. Serine, methionine, lysine, aspartic and glutamic acids and tyrosine were rapidly lost through metabolism, consistent with their presence in easily digestible cell components (as opposed to cell walls which offer physical protection). All sample types (polychaete tissues, sediments and faecal matter) were enriched in labelled glycine. Possible mechanisms for this enrichment include accumulation through inclusion in tissues with long residence times, preferential preservation (i.e. selection against) during metabolism, production from other labelled amino acids during varied metabolic processes, and accumulation in refractory by-products of secondary bacterial production. Overall, similarities were observed between amino-acid decay patterns in faunated microcosms, afaunal controls, and those previously reported in marine sediments. Thus, while polychaete gut passage did produce compound-selective accumulation and losses of certain amino acids in polychaete tissues and faecal matter, the impact of polychaete gut passage on sediment organic geochemistry was difficult to deconvolve from microbial decay. Despite processing large volumes of organic matter, polychaetes may not have distinctive influence on sediment compositions, possibly because metabolic processes concerning amino acids may be broadly similar across a wide range of organisms.

This is problematic for slow intertidal organisms that cannot move at the speed of tidal fluctuations. The timing of low tides determines which days organisms may experience extreme body temperatures, controlling microclimate to a greater degree than weather patterns. When low tides occur midday, temperatures can exceed critical thermal maxima for many species. Although high shore areas experience the greatest environmental extremes, they often harbor untapped food resources. The periodicity of low tide timing creates a predictable cycle that marine animals can use to obtain food in risky areas while minimizing exposure to thermal extremes. Here, we use a two-part approach to assess whether the snail, Nucella ostrina, uses the predictability of the tidal cycle to obtain food in risky areas while minimizing exposure to thermal extremes. Radio tracking detected the presence/absence of snails in high shore feeding areas continuously for 14 weeks and physical thermal models approximated snail body temperature in those high shore areas. Snails were absent when extreme low tides occurred at times of high solar irradiance (midday). Comparing the subset of physical model body temperatures foraging snails experienced to all available body temperatures in the high shore environment showed snails in foraging areas disproportionately at 9-12 degrees C and absent at body temperatures > 31 degrees C, suggesting that N. ostrina is not present when and where thermal risk is greatest. These patterns demonstrate that censuring only at low tide yields an adequate picture of foraging behavior of this species in its natural habitat, and that migratory foraging behavior effectively moderates snail experience of environmental temperature in nature and may buffer this species from aerial warming.",,,,,"O'Donnell, Michael/AAK-2314-2021; Hayford, Hilary/B-6169-2015","O'Donnell, Michael/0000-0001-7016-0614; Hayford, Hilary/0000-0002-2812-3446",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,FEB,2018,499,,,,,,17,25,,10.1016/j.jembe.2017.12.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2017.12.005,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000423655000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Preprocessing of the Geosat data included removal of a mean sea surface and orbit error and corrections for tides, wave height, inverse barometer, and ionospheric and dry tropospheric effects. Geosat data were not corrected for water vapor. Central to the analysis was the computation of a spatially anisotropic, time-dependent autocorrelation function directly from the Geosat data. Results show a single autocorrelation function peak, having a diameter of approximately 270 km at 0-day time lag. A 15-month time series of RSHA topography was constructed at 10-day intervals, forming a set of 47 OA maps. These maps show a field of topographic features propagating to the west at approximately 4 km d-1. The features exhibited spatial and temporal scales of approximately 200 km and approximately 50 days, respectively. The root-mean-square (rms) of the OA-derived feature amplitudes fluctuated slowly between 0.05 and 0.09 m with a period of approximately 200 days over the 15-month interval. These fluctuations appeared to be related to the passage of large-scale, northeast-southwest trending sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly features reported for FASINEX, which were surface manifestations of large-scale, first-mode baroclinic Rossby waves. The rms amplitude of the OA-derived features was maximal (minimal) during periods of negative (positive) SST anomaly, when the depths of the mixed layer and main thermocline in the upper ocean shoaled (deepened). The fluctuations also appeared to be correlated with the structure of the field. Periods of decreased features amplitudes corresponded to a closely packed structure, while during times of increased amplitudes, the field structure became zonal with regions of alternating sign. During FASINEX (January-June 1986) the field was characterized by the closely packed structure and decreasing feature amplitudes.

As realistic measures of fitness are usually difficult to perform directly, integrating fitness indices are proposed in all taxa. In sauropsids, locomotor performances have been proposed as a good integrating index of fitness in natural populations. Concerning aquatic turtles, a performance trait that may be important for the survival of juveniles is the righting response of individuals when they are placed on their carapace. In the present study, we examined the righting response in juveniles of the red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans. We tested two different measures of the righting response for 170 juveniles from constant incubation temperature and for 86 juveniles from three sinusoidal fluctuating incubation temperatures that are considered as more representative of natural conditions in the nest. We compared the effects of offspring sex, maternal identity, juvenile growth rate, and juvenile survival (i.e. individual characteristics), as well as the nutritional status of juveniles (i.e. experimental conditions), on the two different measures of righting response and for each thermal incubation treatments of the eggs (i.e. experimental treatments). We observed that the effects of the individual characteristics were markedly different between the two measures of the righting response and between experimental treatments. These results highlight the importance of the choice of the measure and of the experimental conditions and treatments in the study of a phenotypic trait. Results obtained for only one performance measure under constant laboratory conditions must therefore be extrapolated to the field with caution. Our results also show that the righting response presents individual variability that is probably heritable and is indirectly correlated with survival. These findings support the validity of the righting response as a good candidate for a fitness index in aquatic turtles.

Humidity absorbing trays containing active moisture absorber substance in the structure have been recently emerged as a potential solution in this area. Here packaging of strawberries using two different humidity absorbing trays of different moisture absorption capacity named T0 and T12, under fluctuating ambient conditions was simulated using an integrated mathematical modeling approach and validated experimentally. The model considered transpiration and respiration behavior of fresh produce, moisture absorption by packaging tray, gas and water vapor permeation through the perforated packaging film to predict changes in relative humidity of packaging headspace as well as moisture condensation within the package. Based on RMSE values, there was a good agreement between predicted and measured data of humidity, moisture loss, absorption and condensation inside the package. The RMSE values for prediction of the headspace humidity were 1.28, 2.38 and 4.34 and corresponding R-2 values were 0.71, 0.86 and 0.87 for control, T0 and T12 packages, respectively. Further simulations were made to design MAHP for strawberry using T12 tray and appropriate number of perforations in packaging film under different conditions of fruit mass and ambient temperature. For example, using 1 perforation of 0.8 mm diameter for 6 days storage of a 400 g strawberry package under 15 degrees C ambient temperature, resulted in desired gas composition of O-2 (7.0%) and CO2 (12.6%), while preventing humidity saturation and consequent moisture condensation by keeping in-package equilibrium humidity at 97.6% and maintaining fruit mass loss less than 0.3%.",,,,,"Sängerlaub, Sven/AAC-4610-2022; Mahajan, Pramod V/C-7891-2009","Sängerlaub, Sven/0000-0002-4916-9240; Mahajan, Pramod V/0000-0002-6597-9841; Jalali, Ali/0000-0002-5533-2200",,,,,,,,,,,,,0260-8774,1873-5770,,,,MAR,2019,244,,,,,,115,125,,10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.09.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.09.006,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000450376500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

In contrast, warmer, less viscous water may have a positive influence on sperm swimming speed and so ocean warming may enhance fertilization. To address questions on future vulnerabilities we examined the interactive effects of near-future ocean warming and ocean acidification/hypercapnia on fertilization in intertidal and shallow subtidal echinoids (Heliocidaris erythrogramma, H. tuberculata, Tripneustes gratilla, Centrostephanus rodgersii), an asteroid (Patiriella regularis) and an abalone (Haliotis coccoradiata). Batches of eggs from multiple females were fertilized by sperm from multiple males in all combinations of three temperature and three pH/PCO2 treatments. Experiments were placed in the setting of projected near-future conditions for southeast Australia, an ocean change hot spot. There was no significant effect of warming and acidification on the percentage of fertilization. These results indicate that fertilization in these species is robust to temperature and pH/PCO2 fluctuation. This may reflect adaptation to the marked fluctuation in temperature and pH that characterises their shallow water coastal habitats.

Acting as passive Solar heating elements, sunspaces are intended to be a valuable tool among sustainable and energy-efficient constructive and/or retrofitting strategies. In order to assess the energy saving potential of the above-mentioned coupling and relate it to the main design parameters, two operative steps were carried out: the numerical step allowed different simulated configurations to be evaluated in order to identify the optimal one from an energy perspective and physically realize it; the monitoring phase served the double purpose of calibrating the simulation model and provide on -site validated data for subsequent assessments and comparisons. Three main sunspace configurations were tested: irradiative single -glazed, irradiative double-glazed and convective double-glazed. The convective double glazed configuration was found to outperform the others since the daily energy consumption reduction exceeded the 27% (compared to the irradiative, double glazed counterpart) for all weather conditions. Besides, the activation of a mechanical ventilation system was slightly counterproductive in terms of discomfort phenomena since a less stable indoor air temperature was guaranteed. Comparing the two irradiative configurations, it was found that the addition of an extra glass layer was responsible of a quite constant reduction of 1 kW h/day, thus increasing the percent heating energy demand saving achieved through the insertion of the sunspace from approximately 3,3%-8,7%, while minimizing indoor air temperature fluctuations too.

Subsequent chilling at 3-6-degrees-C for 2-6 weeks enforced induction and synchronized and enhanced heading and inflorescence development.

These results demonstrate that the environmental flowering control system of C. bigelowii is similar to that of many arctic-alpine grasses.

FORHYCS is based on the coupling of the hydrological model PREVAH and the forest landscape model TreeMig. In a coupled simulation, both original models are executed simultaneously and exchange information through shared variables. The simulated canopy structure is summarized by the leaf area index (LAI), which affects local water balance calculations. On the other hand, an annual drought index is obtained from daily simulated potential and actual transpiration. This drought index affects tree growth and mortality, as well as a species-specific tree height limitation. The effective rooting depth is simulated as a function of climate, soil, and simulated above-ground vegetation structure. Other interface variables include stomatal resistance and leaf phenology. Case study simulations with the model were performed in the Navizence catchment in the Swiss Central Alps, with a sharp elevational gradient and climatic conditions ranging from dry inner-alpine to high alpine. In a first experiment, the model was run for 500 years with different configurations. The results were compared against observations of vegetation properties from national forest inventories, remotely sensed LAI, and high-resolution canopy height maps from stereo aerial images. Two new metrics are proposed for a quantitative comparison of observed and simulated canopy structure. In a second experiment, the model was run for 130 years under climate change scenarios using both idealized temperature and precipitation change and meteorological forcing from downscaled GCM-RCM model chains. The first experiment showed that model configuration greatly influences simulated vegetation structure. In particular, simulations where height limitation was dependent on environmental stress showed a much better fit to canopy height observations. Spatial patterns of simulated LAI were more realistic than for uncoupled simulations of the forest landscape model, although some model deficiencies are still evident. Under idealized climate change scenarios, the effect of the coupling varied regionally, with the greatest effects on simulated streamflow (up to 60 mm yr(-1) difference with respect to a simulation with static vegetation parameters) seen at the valley bottom and in regions currently above the tree-line. This case study shows the importance of coupling hydrology and vegetation dynamics to simulate the impact of climate change on ecosystems. Nevertheless, it also highlights some challenges of ecohydrological modeling, such as the need to realistically simulate the plant response to increased CO2 concentrations and process uncertainty regarding future land cover changes.",,,,,"Zappa, Massimiliano/AAY-3821-2020; Lischke, Heike/J-5719-2013","Zappa, Massimiliano/0000-0002-2837-8190; Lischke, Heike/0000-0003-4284-5194; Speich, Matthias/0000-0003-0173-5351",,,,,,,,,,,,,1991-959X,1991-9603,,,,FEB 11,2020,13,2,,,,,537,564,,10.5194/gmd-13-537-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-537-2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000514115100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mesocosm respiration was consistently lower and higher in cycled mesocosms compared to mesocosms kept unfrozen (+2degreesC) and frozen (-4degreesC), respectively. When extrapolated to the entire non-growing season, our data suggest a non-growing season carbon (C) loss in the order of 20-30 g C m(-2), which is substantial compared with a likely annual incorporation of plant biomass C of 150-200 g C m(-2) per year. The results support the hypothesis that winter carbon fluxes must be included in annual carbon budgets for arctic ecosystems. Microbial biomass C decreased only in cycled mesocosms, indicating that while microbial activity is mainly controlled by temperature, microbial biomass is strongly affected by temperature fluctuations around the freezing point. In contrast to microbial C, microbial biomass nitrogen (N) mass did not change in cycled mesocosms, leading to decreased microbial C to N ratio. Second, soil inorganic N concentration declined in the soils subjected to the cycles, showing that microbes surviving the freeze-thaw cycles had a high potential for sequestering soil N and N that presumably was released from dead microbes. The two sets of mesocosms responded very similarly to the freeze-thaw cycles, indicating that the observed responses to multiple diurnal freeze-thaw cycles are common for both ecosystem types despite the differences in plant species composition and climate.

In the present study, additional measurements of embryonic fH in three ASA species, the barn owl Tyto alba, the cattle egret Bubulcus ibis and the lanner falcon Falco biarmicus, were made to extend the egg mass range (20-41 g), and the allometric relationships of embryonic fH for these ASA birds and the precocial and semi-precocial (PSP) groups were investigated from published data. The developmental patterns of embryonic fn in three relatively large ASA species did not show a significant increase prior to the pipping period, unlike those in small ASA birds, but tended to be constant, with a subsequent increase during pipping. The allometric relationship derived for ASA birds was fH at 80 % ID=371M(-0.121) (r=-0.846, P<0.001, N=20) and that for PSP birds was fH at 80 % ID=433M(-0.121) (r=-0.963, P<0.001, N=13), The slopes were parallel, but fH of ASA embryos was low compared with that of PSP embryos with the same egg mass.

The allometric relationships for fH at 80 % ID in PSP and fH(max) in ASA embryos were statistically identical.

Here, we aimed at comparing sensitivity and magnitude of short-term carbon and nitrogen responses of three main tundra ecosystem compartments: vascular plants, mosses, and soil, to two environmental perturbations: herbivore disturbance and warming. In a full-factorial field experiment in the high-Arctic Svalbard, we simulated herbivore disturbance as spring grubbing activity by pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) and passively increased summer temperatures using open-top chambers. Manipulations were set up within three habitats that differ in soil moisture and carried out for two consecutive growing seasons. Overall, we found small and few significant responses to herbivore disturbance and warming, suggesting that carbon and nitrogen contents of high-Arctic ecosystems are relatively resistant to these perturbations, at least in the short term. However, the three ecosystem compartments still differed in their sensitivity to perturbations (vascular plants > soil > mosses), and this was exacerbated by their differential sensitivity across habitats (mesic > moist > wet). Also, while vascular plants responded to herbivore disturbance in mesic and wet habitats and to warming in mesic and moist habitats, soil and mosses only responded to herbivore disturbance in mesic and wet habitats, respectively. Responses to treatments were generally consistent across the two growing seasons, despite great differences in temperature conditions and large between-year variations in the chemical composition of the three ecosystem compartments. These findings highlight the potential for environmental perturbations to have small, yet differential short-term impacts on the carbon and nitrogen contents of vascular plants, mosses, and soil, both within and between tundra habitats. Our results imply that assessments of a single ecosystem compartment in a given context cannot be extrapolated to the whole ecosystem, thus stressing the importance of considering both vegetation and soil carbon and nitrogen responses, and how they display across habitats, in order to better understand how environmental changes might affect biogeochemical processes in the tundra.

Grazing studies were done in conjunction with studies of accumulation of Alexandrium toxins in the zooplankton, as part of the ECOHAB-Gulf of Maine regional Program. several species of copepods, marine cladocerans, and appendicularians were allowed to graze upon natural phytoplankton assemblages, at ambient temperatures (14-17 degrees C). Grazing was measured by quantitative microscopic analyses of disappearance of phytoplankton cells in initial, Control, and experimental food suspensions. Thus, we were able to examine grazing upon Alexandrium in comparison to grazing oil other co-occurring phytoplankton taxa. Even during Alexandrium blooms, this dinoflagellate was a minor component of the overall phytoplankton assemblage. It was present at stations where grazing experiments were conducted at levels of 0.12-7.57 x 10(3) cells 1(-1), or 0.03-3.93% of total phytoplankton cells. Maximum ingestion of Alexandrium accounted for only up to 3.2% of total cells ingested. Phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by athecate microflagellates, and to a lesser extent by diatoms and non-toxic dinoflagellates. Microflagellates were present at abundances of 159.62-793.93 cells ml(-1), or 60.6-95.56% of total cells. Grazing oil microflagellates accounted for 35.59-98.21% of total grazing. Grazing oil Alexandrium spp. and microflagellates was generally non-selective, with these taxa being ingested in similar proportions to their availability in food assemblages. Grazing oil diatoms was selective, with diatoms being disproportionately ingested, compared to their proportions in food assemblages. There were no apparent adverse effects of Alexandrium on grazers during incubations of 18-24 h, and grazer survival was 100%. Estimated daily zooplankton,razing impact on Alexandrium spp. field populations by field populations of experimental grazers averaged 5.79% (range = 0-117%). Extrapolating experimentally determined grazing rates to total zooplankton assemblages increased potential grazing impact to 0-667.77% (mean = 114.7%). However, these potential impacts are likely overestimations, because toxin accumulation data indicated that many of the most-abundant zooplankters (Oithona similis copepodites and copepod nauplii) likely graze only minimally upon Alexandrium spp. Thus, antipredation effects of high concentrations of Alexandrium on some grazers reported from some laboratory studies may only occur rarely in nature, because of low individual zooplankter grazing rates on Alexandrium, and dilution of grazing upon it by grazing on other food sources such as abundant microflagellates and diatoms.

The flux was calculated based on hourly measurements of the NO soil-atmosphere concentration gradient using the one-dimensional soil diffusion model of Galbally and Johansson (1989). The soil bulk diffusion coefficient was determined from measurements of the Rn-222 surface flux and the activity gradient between 10 cm depth and the surface. It ranged between 79% and 0.3% of the NO diffusion coefficient in air and was parameterised by air filled soil pore space. The indirectly determined NO flux agreed well with standard flux measurements using dynamic chambers. The largest NO emission was found following fertiliser application and irrigation. The emission occurred in pulses, which lasted for 4 days up to 3 weeks coinciding with elevated soil ammonium concentrations. Nitric oxide emission in 5 days following application of cattle slurry were 31 g NO-N ha(-)1 and 5 g NO-N ha(-1) from the non-fertilised plot, respectively. Nitric oxide emission in 15 days following application of NH4NO3 was 95 g NO-N ha(-1) and 10 g NO-N ha(-1) from the non-fertilised plot, respectively. NO emission in 4 days following irrigation on 21 April were 36 g N ha(-1) from the fertilised and 39 g N ha(-1) from the non-fertilised plot. The daily NO emission before and after fertiliser and irrigation pulses was between 0.3 and 0.7 g NO-N ha(-1) d(-1). NO production and NO uptake of the soil was measured regularly. No systematic influence of management or climate on NO uptake was found. NO production was strongly stimulated by fertiliser input and soil moisture content. The simulation of NO production could be reproduced using a nitrification algorithm (Riedo et al., 1998) driven by soil temperature, moisture and ammonium concentration. A NO production rate constant of 1.1.10(-3) h(-1) at 15 degrees C was derived from a linear regression between nitrification and NO production. Introducing the parameterisation of NO production into the model of Galbally and Johansson (1989) the duration and the strength of the NO emission pulses could be reproduced and the total NO emission during the experiment was approximated within a factor of two.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,,,,,,1999,216,1-2,,,,,165,180,,10.1023/A:1004752104808,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004752104808,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000084854800016,View Full Record in Web of Science

E.",,,Impacts of a limit-feeding procedure on variation and accuracy of cattle weights,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cattle weights can be highly variable and are influenced by many factors, including time of weighing, ambient temperature, feed intake, and cattle handling. A protocol of limit feeding has been in use since the 1980s that was designed to reduce variation in gut fill due to differences in intakes. Cattle are penned and fed a 50% hay, 50% wet corn gluten feed or grain diet (DM basis) at an estimated 2% of BW for at least 5 d, after which weights are taken on 2 consecutive d and averaged for a limit-fed BW (LFW). For this analysis, full-fed weights (FFW) also were taken before the limit-feeding period while cattle had ad libitum intakes. Data from 18 experiments were used to analyze differences within 2-d LFW and between LFW and FFW. For 10 of the 18 experiments, FFW also were measured on 2 consecutive d. Cattle included in this summary were grazing cornstalks, smooth bromegrass pasture, Bermuda grass pasture, fescue pasture, native range, or in a dry lot on a 70% forage diet. The largest differences between FFW and LFW for individual cattle were -39 to +44 kg over all 18 experiments. Differences between 2 consecutive d of LFW were -23 to +24 kg for all 18 experiments. Differences between 2 d of FFW were -14 to +34 kg in the 10 experiments measuring FFW on 2 consecutive d. There was not a clear relationship between FFW and LFW; each weighing scenario had unique environmental conditions that led to different relationships. Differences in both beginning and ending BW were compounded when calculating ADG. Average daily gain was calculated for 15 of the experiments on the basis of either LFW or FFW. Differences between LFW and FFW ADG were -0.29 to +0.31 kg/d. The maximum ADG based on FFW was 1.62 kg/d. This large ADG, on a forage based diet, was likely due to changes in gut fill rather than tissue gain. These data suggest that handling cattle in a similar manner when weighing is more important than limiting intakes to decrease variance between weights. However, limiting intake before collection of beginning and ending BW better estimates empty body weight of cattle, allowing for a more accurate determination of actual body tissue weight gain. Measuring weights accurately becomes especially crucial when evaluating multiple components within a system (e. g., cornstalks to pasture to feedlot). Feeding a standard diet between these components of the system minimizes differences in gut fill due to treatment and allows for a more accurate determination of each component's contribution to the total system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8812,1525-3163,,,,NOV,2013,91,11,,,,,5507,5517,,10.2527/jas.2013-6349,http://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2013-6349,,,,,,,,24045485,,,,,WOS:000326515900047,View Full Record in Web of Science

An ARA-enriched oil was supplemented into the basal diet to formulate six isonitrogenous and isoenergetic practical diets containing 0.08% ( the control group), 022%, 036%, 0.56%, 1.33% and 2.12% ARA of dry weight, respectively. All diets had the same total n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) level and 22:6n-3/20:5n-3 ratio. Triplicate groups of 30 fish were fed to apparent satiation twice daily for 12 weeks. The water temperature ranged from 22.5 to 31.5 degrees C, the salinity from 28%. to 33% and the dissolved oxygen content was approximately 6 mgl(-1) during the experimental period. The results showed that final weight (FW) and specific growth rate (SGR) significantly increased with increasing dietary ARA from 0.08% to 0.36% (P<0.01) and thereafter declined. The feed efficiency ratio (FER) had the similar pattern with SGR, and fish fed the diet with 0.36% ARA showed significantly higher FER than the control (P<0.05). No significant differences were found in survival rate among dietary treatments (P>0.05). The hepatosomatic index (HSI) decreased significantly with the increase of dietary ARA, and HSI in fish fed the diets with more than 022% ARA content were significantly lower than the control group (P<0.01). The serum lysozyme (LYZ), alternative complement pathway (ACP) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were significantly enhanced by the supplementation of ARA, especially in moderate supplementation (0.36-0.56%). However, there were no differences in both respiratory burst activity of head kidney macrophage and serum catalase (CAT) activity among dietary treatments. The body composition analysis showed that whole-body protein first increased, then decreased with increasing dietary ARA, while whole-body lipid content followed the opposite pattern. The fatty acid composition of whole body and liver reflected closely those of the diets, while liver EPA levels were inversely related to dietary ARA. These results suggested that dietary ARA, especially moderate ARA level (0.22-0.56% d.w.), significantly enhanced growth and immune response and modified the chemical composition of whole body and liver of Japanese seabass juvenile.

We investigated seasonal (wet versus dry season) and spatial variation in populations of algivorous Pseudogastromyzon myersi in Hong Kong, and estimated the magnitude of secondary production by this fish in pools in four streams (two shaded and two unshaded) over a 15-month period. Mean population densities of P. myersi ranged from 6.0 to 23.2 individuals m(-2), constituting more than half (and typically > 70%) of benthic fishes censused. Abundance was c. 25% greater in the wet season, when recruitment occurred. Significant density differences among streams were not related to shading conditions and were evident despite small-scale variations in P. myersi abundance among pools. Mean biomass varied among streams from 0.85 to 3.87 g ash-free dry weight (AFDW) m(-2). Spatial and seasonal patterns in biomass and density were similar, apart from some minor disparities attributable to differences in mean body size among populations. All four P. myersi populations bred once a year in June and July, and life spans varied from 24 to 26 months. Populations consisted of three cohorts immediately after recruitment but, for most of the study period, only two cohorts were evident. Cohort-specific growth rates did not differ significantly among streams but, in all streams, younger cohorts had higher cohort-specific growth rates. Secondary production of P. myersi estimated by the size-frequency (SF) method was 2.7-11.5 g AFDW m(-2) year(-1) and almost twice that calculated by the increment-summation (IS) method (1.2-6.6 g AFDW m(-2) year(-1)). Annual P/B ratios were 1.17-2.16 year(-1) (IS) and 2.73-3.22 year(-1) (SF). Highest production was recorded in an unshaded stream and the lowest in a shaded stream, but site rankings by production did not otherwise match shading conditions. Wet-season production was six times greater than dry-season production, and daily production fell to almost zero during January and February. Cool temperatures (< 17 degrees C) may have limited fish activity and influenced detectability during some dry-season censuses. Estimates of abundance and annual production by P. myersi are therefore conservative. Comparisons with the literature indicate that the abundance and production of P. myersi in Hong Kong was high relative to other benthic fishes in tropical Asia, or their temperate counterparts in small streams. Manipulative experiments are needed to determine the influence of P. myersi, and algivorous balitorids in general, on periphyton dynamics and energy flow in Asian streams.",,,,,"Dudgeon, David/A-2733-2010",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,SEP,2009,54,9,,,,,1960,1976,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02249.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02249.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000268791700014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its control is particularly difficult. The nematophagous fungus Duddingtonia flagrans has been shown to be effective in trapping a large range of gastrointestinal nematode larvae but its trapping activity against small lungworm, remains to be assessed. The purpose of this work was firstly, to evaluate the ability of first-stage larvae of M. capillaris.(L1) to induce trap formation in in vitro conditions and secondly, to determine the effect of D.flagrans on the L1 infectivity to snails. In experiments on agar, the presence of L1 failed to induce any D. flagrans traps whereas in the same conditions, gastro-intestinal third-stage larvae induced 44-135 traps/cm(2) depending on the species. Moreover, when the traps were pre-induced by Haemonchus contortus larvae, the L1 of M. capillaris were not trapped. For the in vivo trial, two goats naturally infected with M. capillaris received D. flagrans chlamydospores at the daily dose rate of 5 x 10(5) spores/kg BW for 8 days. Faeces were collected individually before, during and 11 days after spore administration. On each day of harvest, the initial larval output was determined. The remaining faeces were subjected to coproculture at 21 degrees C for 7 days. At the end of this period, L1 were collected and used to infect snails (30 snails per goat isolate each snail given 40 L I by direct deposit of the larvae on the foot of the snail). These snails were artificially challenged in contrast to others that were exposed to natural infection by exposure to faeces carrying first-stage M. capillaris larvae. The natural infection used the same number of snails, i.e. 30 snails deposited on the faeces of each goat. After 3 weeks at room temperature, the infective larvae present in the snail foot were counted. There was no difference in the survival of the L1 in faeces after coproculture whether the faeces contained D. flagrans or not. The infectivity of the extracted larvae from the two goats before and after fungal administration was the same. The number of infective larvae per snail obtained after natural infection showed variations that were not related to the presence of D. flagrans mycellium in faeces. These trials clearly indicate that D. flagrans was unable to trap or to alter the infectivity of M. capillaris first-stage larvae and thus cannot be considered as a non-chemotherapeutic alternative approach to the control of the small lungworm in goats.

Susceptibility to cold winter conditions has been recognized as the limiting factor in Europe for Tetranychus evansi, an invasive spider mite feeding on Solanaceous plants originated from tropical South America and now present on every continent except Australia. Two genetically distinct lineages of this species were introduced to Europe; one (lineage 1) is widely distributed, while the other (lineage 2) has a limited distribution. Whether this difference corresponds to differences in cold hardiness is evaluated here by assessing phenotypic response of T. evansi to the winter conditions that the mite encounters in the coldest parts of the current invaded area. We designed the thermal regimes to mimic winter conditions, including temperature fluctuations between day and night (L:D 8:16, 12:4 degrees C) and exposed mites to this regime for 5, 10 or 15 weeks. We tested T. evansi from three locations, one from the tropical native area (Piracicaba, Brazil) and two, corresponding to the two introduced lineages, from the temperate invaded area (lineage 1 from Nice and lineage 2 from Perpignan, France). After 5 weeks of treatment, mites from all the locations showed high survival rates but the two introduced populations grew, producing more than one offspring per female. After 10 weeks, survival rates declined for mites from Brazil and Perpignan, but not Nice. After 15 weeks, only the mites from Nice survived and produced offspring. Thus, mites belonging to the widespread lineage 1 exhibit increased cold tolerance suggesting broader adaptability, helping to explain its current geographical distribution.",,,,,"NAVAJAS, Maria/AAM-2294-2020; Hufbauer, Ruth/ABA-3984-2020","NAVAJAS, Maria/0000-0002-0702-4238; Hufbauer, Ruth/0000-0002-8270-0638; Migeon, Alain/0000-0003-4041-5158",,,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,AUG,2015,17,8,,,,,2275,2285,,10.1007/s10530-015-0873-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-015-0873-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000357460000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there is a lack of studies in the built environment assessing expectations directly and the relationship between expectations and thermal perception. Therefore, this paper studies potential influences on occupants' expectations of indoor thermal conditions and the implications of their expectations on thermal perception. A combination of data from laboratory and field studies was analysed, where the same 47 participants participated in both of them. Subjects experienced different temperature conditions and were asked directly about the congruence between their thermal expectations and actual experience together with their actual thermal perception. The question regarding participants expectations applied in this study can be considered as the most straightforward way to ask for their expectations. The data was analysed by ordinal mixed effect regression analysis. Results show that there is a significant influence of the level of expectation on thermal sensation and comfort votes for the field and laboratory study. Indoor temperature, the day of experiment (first, second, or third) and the location (laboratory vs. field) show significant influences on thermal expectation. However, participants state their expectation of the indoor environment independent of the outdoor conditions or indoor-outdoor temperature difference. The discussion of implications of these results for adaptive approaches of room conditioning, which relay on the acceptance of higher fluctuations of indoor thermal conditions, suggests to carefully address expectations in future studies.

Embryonic thermal sensitivity might be a driving force in the emergence of prenatal parental care, such as maternal thermoregulation. Viviparity has emerged on repeated occasions among squamate reptiles, and two main evolutionary hypotheses based on maternal thermoregulation have been proposed to explain these transitions, namely the 'cold climate hypothesis' and the 'maternal manipulation hypothesis'. Squamate embryos typically face important daily temperature fluctuations either in the nest or within the maternal body, but most experimental studies on development have relied on constant temperature. Therefore, we may have only limited insight on the effect of maternal thermoregulation on embryo development. We manipulated thermal conditions to compare the influence of a typical maternal temperature cycle (M) or nest thermal conditions (N) both during gravidity and during incubation in the oviparous form of a reproductively bimodal squamate (Zootoca vivipara). Although the two treatments had a similar mean temperature, we found that M treatment accelerated development, notably when applied during gravidity. Only limited effects were found when considering offspring phenotype and performance. Overall, our results suggest that small changes in thermal conditions can have a strong impact on reproductive phenology and might be a proximate target in the emergence of egg retention and, ultimately, of viviparity.

Among available options, the incorporation of legumes allows to reduce synthetic N fertilizer use, the use of cover crops is an efficient way to decrease nitrate leaching and recycle nutrients, while mechanical weeding together with crop rotation help to limit the use of pesticides. However, how these options affect N2O emissions remains uncertain. Here we studied N2O emissions of four cropping systems which were designed as low input alternatives to the conventional wheat-sunflower rotation in south-west France and make use of the aforementioned options. The used cropping systems differ by synthetic N fertilizer input: 96 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) for the Low Input (LI) cropping system and 33 kg N ha(-1) year for the Very Low Input (VLI) cropping system which incorporates a grain legume in the rotation. For each of the two systems (LI and VLI), both a variation with cover crop (+CC) and without cover crop ( CC) were studied. Daily N2O fluxes were measured almost continuously (at least 87% of the 3-year rotation duration) using automatic chambers. Measurements of soil water content, soil temperature, mineral nitrogen (N) content were also carried out. Cumulative N2O emissions over the whole 3-year rotation were in the low range of literature values for all systems but they were significantly higher for the VLI cropping system (1.12 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1)) than for the LI cropping system (0.78 kg N2O-N ha(-1) year(-1)) on average over +CC and CC. Patterns of emissions were also different between the two systems, with emissions taking place in the-form of short-lived peaks only after N fertilization for LI, while peaks occurred more frequently over the whole rotation for VLI. No difference between the +CC and CC cropping systems could be detected at the scale of the rotation (P = 0.47). Although N2O fluxes increased significantly fora few days after cover crop destruction (P = 0.002), the contribution of such events to cumulative N2O emissions remained negligible (<10 g N2O-N ha(-1)). The effect of tillage events, especially when they were not associated with crop residues return to soil, was also found to be small. As expected, both temperature and soil water content had a strong influence on N2O emissions, although the underlying relationships often only appear clearly during specific periods, e.g. during summer for the soil moisture effect. Because agronomical practices such as increased use of legume crops and use of cover crops only have a limited effect on N2O emissions, their adoption can be considered on the basis of the benefits they have to address other important agronomic or environmental issues.

The levels of changed metabolites could be organized in four clusters by hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). According to the pathway, raffinose, maltose, glucose and fructose derived from the hydrolysis of sucrose were all more abundant in leaves of OA than those of DP. Despite temperature fluctuation, leucine, valine, threonine, alanine were all in higher level in leaves of DP than those of OA except Nov. 16. Citric acid, fumaric acid and malic acid were in higher level under the higher temperature in DP. Shikimic acid and quinic acid presented an absolutely distinct metabolism pattern. Shikimic acid was negatively correlated with quinic acid in both treatments except Mar. 16. They were at high level on Nov. 16, and then decreased sharply in the following periods in both treatments during the experiment. The results indicated that the different low temperatures had significantly different effects on tea plants and could change their metabolic pathways in different ways. These might be helpful to understand the mechanism of cold resistance of tea plants at the metabolite level and to facilitate the future research on gene and protein expression in tea plants of DP and OA in winter.

Before the experiments, animals were housed under natural photoperiod and then transferred to 12L:12D (light 12 hr:dark 12 hr) in autumn for 12 weeks. After 4 weeks of acclimation, photoschedule was reversed (12D:12L). First experiments were done after 4 weeks of acclimation to an ambient temperature (T(a)) of 23 degrees C and a 12L:12D photoschedule. We examined the daily variations in brown adipose tissue (BAT) capacity for nonshivering thermogenesis (NST). Noradrenaline (NA) injections were given every 4hr while BAT temperature (T(BAT)) and preferred ambient temperature (PT(a)) were monitored continuously and simultaneously in a thermal gradient system. Then, we investigated the effect of light-dark cycle reversal on a daily rhythm of NST. The hamsters were acclimated to the photoschedule reversed by 12 hr and the same T(a). After 4 and 8 weeks of acclimation to a reversed photoschedule, the experiments were repeated. We found that the daily rhythm of the response to NA was entrained to the new light-dark cycle after 4 weeks of acclimation to a reversed photoschedule. Maximum effect of NA was always recorded during the light phase and in the latter part of the dark phase of the day. NA-induced increase in T(BAT) was correlated with the decrease in PT(a), and was also inversely correlated with pre-injection T(BAT). These data imply that the daily rhythm of the capacity for NST opposes the daily rhythm of body temperature (T(b))After 8 weeks of acclimation to the reversed photoschedule, the rhythmicity of the response to NA disappeared, and the daily fluctuations in T(BAT) were the smallest. This lack of rhythm may be a physiological adaptation to winter conditions when the daily amplitude of T(b) rhythm is markedly reduced and, as a consequence, NST capacity does not vary within the day. Moreover, after 8 weeks of acclimation to reversed photoschedule, NST capacity decreased while response to saline increased. During the experiments, hamsters were photosensitive and were changing to their winter status. However, because of the lack of cold during acclimation, the capacity for NST did not increase. Increased responsiveness to saline, indicating an increase in stress-induced thermogenesis, might be advantageous for fight or flight reaction.",,,,,"Tęgowska, Eugenia/H-4250-2014; Wojciechowski, Michal S/A-6939-2010; Jefimow, Małgorzata/G-3592-2014","Wojciechowski, Michal S/0000-0001-7765-0720; Jefimow, Malgorzata/0000-0001-6403-0733",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-5223,,,,,NOV 1,2005,303A,11,,,,,987,997,,10.1002/jez.a.226,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.a.226,,,,,,,,16217806,,,,,WOS:000232939400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most attempts to control Sapium are only temporarily effective because of its large seed bank and ability to resprout from cut stumps. We performed a two-year field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of using large shredding mowers to mulch live Sapium trees and restore Sapium-invaded prairies. We predicted that Sapium mulch would damp diurnal soil temperature fluctuations and suppress Sapium seed germination because Sapium seed germination is highly dependent upon those fluctuations. We manipulated mulch depths and types (0, 10, and 15 cm deep Sapium mulch and hardwood and straw mulch) in the field and measured soil temperatures beneath them. Diurnal soil temperature fluctuations were damped at depths as little as 5 cm, and Sapium mulch significantly reduced Sapium seedling emergence. Deep layers of Sapium mulch (15 cm) reduced seedling survival and native vegetation cover as well. Comparisons among Sapium mulch and alternative mulch materials revealed no allelopathic effects of Sapium mulch on Sapium seedling emergence, survival, or growth. Vigorous regrowth of native vegetation through 5 cm of Sapium mulch was evident by the end of the first growing season. With no trees or stumps remaining on the site, a mowing regime can be implemented immediately regardless of the pre-mulching density of the trees. A heavy closed-canopy Sapium forest might result in mulch depths that slow the return of native vegetation and delay accumulation of adequate fuel loads to support prescribed burning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0885-8608,2162-4399,,,,JUL,2006,26,3,,,,,244,253,,10.3375/0885-8608(2006)26[244:RAIPBM]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.3375/0885-8608(2006)26[244:RAIPBM]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000239501000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Small-bodied. normative red shiners Cyprinella lutrensis attacked Colorado pikerninnow larvae an average of once per minute, and predation success approached 30% in laboratory aquaria. Attack rate was also high in mesocosm experiments; turbidity and alternative prey reduced predation success. Distributions of hatching dates derived from otolith daily increment analysis showed that large cohorts of Colorado pikerninnow larvae that hatched in the Green River in early summer had low survival to autumn and that the few survivors were fast growing. Larvae hatched in midsummer or later had higher survival. Autumn juveniles grew 12-73% faster than summer juveniles, which suggested differential mortality of slow-growing fish. The IBM simulations integrated size-dependent predator-prey relationships, Colorado pikeminnow life history information, temperature-dependent pikeminnow growth, Green River predator size-structure dynamics, seasonally variable Green River water temperatures, and turbidity and alternative prey availability effects; the simulations showed that red shiner predation interacting with environmental variables may significantly reduce age-0 pikeminnow recruitment in autumn. Recruitment and growth patterns from simulations and field observations were consistent and suggested that the IBM is useful in evaluating management scenarios. Experiments, field studies, and predictive modeling provided consistent evidence that interacting effects of predation and environmental variables, including flow fluctuations, may structure intra-annual growth and recruitment patterns of age-0 Colorado pikeminnow.

Despite the potential importance of salinity and temperature fluctuations for metabolic adaptation, little is known about the impact of environmental changes in estuaries on the survival of residents. Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) is a migratory fish that inhabits estuarine brackish water in its early life stages. The recent decline in the abundance of populations ascending into rivers is of concern for local biodiversity. The present study aims to elucidate the ecological processes that determine the early success of Ayu larvae under variable environmental conditions. The effects of salinity and water temperature on the endogenous growth of newly hatched larvae from the same brood were examined experimentally based on morphological and metabolic characteristics. High salinity and high water temperature together appeared to require more energy for larval osmoregulation, resulting in the acceleration of yolk depletion and reduced growth of the notochord. Increasing the osmoregulative cost during the yolk-sac stage resulted in the faster induction of a state of starvation. Seawater is considered to have an adverse effect on the survival of newly hatched larvae, as it lowers the efficiency of foraging and predator avoidance due to an energetic tradeoff. More attention should be paid to the significance of estuarine environments involving brackish waters to ensure the early survival of amphidromous fish such as Ayu.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1341-8998,,,,,JAN,2011,58,1,,,,,33,37,,10.1007/s10228-010-0191-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-010-0191-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000286618900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We monitored CO2 levels in soil gas and as bicarbonate in drainage from an experimental red pine ecosystem, for 1 year before and 3 years after its aboveground biomass was removed. Lack of physical disturbance, strict prevention of plant regrowth, and a comparison ecosystem without rooted plants facilitated isolation of the microclimatic and biochemical effects of instantaneous canopy removal and cessation of photosynthesis. Preharvest gas-phase CO2 levels fluctuated with growing-season soil temperature but reached their greatest levels (up to 10,000 ppmV) during late winter beneath snow and ice cover. This pattern, and the annual CO2 efflux of similar to 500 g C m(-2) yr(-1), continued for 2 years following harvest; the efflux declined by half in the third year. The surprising continuity of preharvest and postharvest rates of soil CO2 production reflects the replacement of root respiration with microbial respiration of root and litter substrates of declining lability, but boosted by soil temperature increases. Mass balance is consistent with a bulk root+litter exponential decay time (-1/k) of 4-6 years, such that most of the subsurface biomass accumulated over 15 years of tree growth would be lost in a decade after the harvest. The preharvest bicarbonate C efflux, which was less than 0.1% of the gas-phase efflux, trebled after the harvest owing to elimination of evapotranspiration and consequent increases in drainage while soil CO2 levels remained high. A large fraction of this hydrospheric'' sink for atmospheric CO2 is attributed to weathering under high soil CO2 levels before spring snowmelt and soil-water flushing.

J,"Netz, RR",,,,"Netz, Roland R.",,,Fluctuation-dissipation relation and stationary distribution of an exactly solvable many-particle model for active biomatter far from equilibrium,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"An exactly solvable, Hamiltonian-based model of many massive particles that are coupled by harmonic potentials and driven by stochastic non-equilibrium forces is introduced. The stationary distribution and the fluctuation-dissipation relation are derived in closed form for the general non-equilibrium case. Deviations from equilibrium are on one hand characterized by the difference of the obtained stationary distribution from the Boltzmann distribution; this is possible because the model derives from a particle Hamiltonian. On the other hand, the difference between the obtained non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation and the standard equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem allows us to quantify non-equilibrium in an alternative fashion. Both indicators of non-equilibrium behavior, i.e., deviations from the Boltzmann distribution and deviations from the equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem, can be expressed in terms of a single non-equilibrium parameter alpha that involves the ratio of friction coefficients and random force strengths. The concept of a non-equilibrium effective temperature, which can be defined by the relation between fluctuations and the dissipation, is by comparison with the exactly derived stationary distribution shown not to hold, even if the effective temperature is made frequency dependent. The analysis is not confined to close-to-equilibrium situations but rather is exact and thus holds for arbitrarily large deviations from equilibrium. Also, the suggested harmonic model can be obtained from non-linear mechanical network systems by an expansion in terms of suitably chosen deviatory coordinates; the obtained results should thus be quite general. This is demonstrated by comparison of the derived non-equilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation with experimental data on actin networks that are driven out of equilibrium by energy-consuming protein motors. The comparison is excellent and allows us to extract the non-equilibrium parameter a from experimental spectral response and fluctuation data.

Despite extensive study, there is uncertainty about how changes in above-ground litter inputs affect soil carbon and nutrient turnover and transformation. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on 70 litter-manipulation experiments in order to assess how changes in above-ground litter inputs alter soil physicochemical properties, carbon dynamics and nutrient cycles. Our results demonstrated that litter removal decreased soil respiration by 34%, microbial biomass carbon in the mineral soil by 39% and total carbon in the mineral soil by 10%, whereas litter addition increased them by 31, 26 and 10%, respectively. This suggests that greater litter inputs increase the soil carbon sink despite higher rates of carbon release and transformation. Total nitrogen and extractable inorganic nitrogen in the mineral soil decreased by 17 and 30%, respectively, under litter removal, but were not altered by litter addition. Overall, litter manipulation had a significant impact upon soil temperature and moisture, but not soil pH; litter inputs were more crucial in buffering soil temperature and moisture fluctuations in grassland than in forest. Compared to other ecosystems, tropical and subtropical forests were more sensitive to variation in litter inputs, as altered litter inputs affected the turnover and accumulation of soil carbon and nutrients more substantially over a shorter time period. Our study demonstrates that although the magnitude of responses differed greatly among ecosystems, the direction of the responses was very similar across different ecosystems.

The objectives of this research were to understand the roles of soil temperature (daily average and fluctuation) and moisture on the emergence of nine winter annual weed species and dandelion and to develop predictive models for weed emergence based on the accumulation of modified thermal/hydrothermal time (mHTT). Experiments were established at Lincoln, NE; Mead, NE; and at two sites (irrigated and rainfed) near Clay Center, NE, in 2010 and 2011. In July of each year, 1,000 seeds of each species were planted in 15 by 20 by 6-cm mesh baskets installed between soybean rows. Soil temperature and water content were recorded at the 2-cm depth. Emerged seedlings were counted and removed from the baskets on a weekly basis until no additional emergence was observed in the fall, resumed in late winter, and continued until emergence ceased in late spring. Weather data were used to accumulate mHTT beginning on August 1. A Weibull function was selected to fit cumulative emergence (%) on cumulative mHTT (seven base temperature [T-base] by six base water potential [Psi(base)] by three base temperature fluctuation [F-base] candidate threshold values 5 126 models); it was also fit to days after August 1 (DAA1), for a total of 127 candidate models per species. The search for optimal base thresholds was based on the theoretic-model comparison approach (Akaike information criterion [AIC]). All three components (T-base, Psi(base), and F-base) were only important for Virginia pepperweed. For downy brome and purslane speedwell, including T-base and Psi(base) resulted in the best fit, whereas for dandelion including T-base and F-base resulted in the best fit. A model including only T-base resulted in the best fit for most species included in this study (Carolina foxtail, shepherd's-purse, pinnate tansymustard, henbit, and field pansy).

Soil temperature was the major environmental factor influencing winter annual weed emergence.

Adaptation to these environmental conditions has been observed in many studies of marine dinoflagellates, diatoms and coccolithophores. An enhancement in traits such as growth and photo-physiological performance and an increase in upper thermal limit have been shown to be possible, although the extent and rate of change differ between microalgal taxa. Studies employing multiple monoclonal replicates showed variation in responses among replicates and revealed the stochasticity of mutations. The work to date is already providing valuable information on species' climate sensitivity or resilience to managers and policymakers but extrapolating these insights to ecosystem- and community-level impacts continues to be a challenge. We recommend future work should include in situ experiments, diurnal and seasonal fluctuations, multiple drivers and multiple starting genotypes. Fitness trade-offs, stable versus plastic responses and the genetic bases of the changes also need investigating, and the incorporation of genome resequencing into experimental designs will be invaluable.",,,,,"Edwards, Owain Rhys/B-9707-2008; Buerger, Patrick/R-4002-2017","Edwards, Owain Rhys/0000-0003-3861-7906; van Oppen, Madeleine/0000-0003-4607-0744; Buerger, Patrick/0000-0002-5762-5146; Chan, Wing Yan/0000-0001-9875-6903",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,MAY,2021,27,9,,,,,1737,1754,,10.1111/gcb.15546,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15546,,FEB 2021,,,,,,33547698,,,,,WOS:000619846100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Simulation of dormancy and germination is based on a physiological model concerning the action of phytochrome in the seed. Dormancy is related to the amount of a hypothetical phytochrome receptor, which fluctuates in an annual pattern. Relief of dormancy is equivalent to an increase in the amount of receptor, and induction of dormancy is equivalent to a decrease in the amount of receptor. Annual changes in temperature are the driving force for annual changes in the amount of phytochrome receptor in seeds that are buried in the seed bank. From the average amount of phytochrome receptor in the seeds of a population, the model calculates the germination percentage that is reached when a seed sample from the population is exhumed, irradiated and incubated at a given temperature in darkness. In the model, relief of dormancy results in a widening of the range of temperatures over which germination can occur, and induction of dormancy results in a narrowing of this range. Model parameters were estimated by fitting the model to data from a burial experiment with seeds of Polygonum persicaria L., Chenopodium album L. and Spergula arvensis L. At regular time intervals during 3 years, subsamples of these seeds were exhumed and tested for germination in the laboratory. The simulation model gave a good description of the observed cyclic changes in germinability of exhumed seeds.",,,,,"Bouwmeester, Harro/C-1414-2008","Bouwmeester, Harro/0000-0003-0907-2732",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-2585,1475-2735,,,,MAR,2001,11,1,,,,,77,92,,10.1079/SSR200062,http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/SSR200062,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000168268600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The heavyweight reinforced concrete and brick masonry construction is the most widespread and technically known constructive system.

Experimental research focused on the comparison between the two constructive systems is yet scarce. The present work intends to focus on this research gap by analysing and comparing the performance of the two constructive systems in terms of indoor thermal environment and thermal comfort, considering an intermittent residential occupation. To this end, a robust experimental campaign was carried out, based on the construction and monitoring of two identical experimental test cells, differing only in the constructive system. The test cells are located in Portugal and were monitored for one full year. It is shown that the LSF constructive system presents higher daily indoor temperature fluctuation and more expressive peak values, following closer the outdoor dry-bulb temperature variations.

This study compared the temperature reductions and heat amplitude reductions provided by four types of green roofing that can cover bare rooftops. The four types of plants grown on extensive green roofs in this study were: shrubs, perennial herbs, vines, and groundcover; these are potentially healing plants. Furthermore, this study investigated the effects of air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation on temperature reduction of the rooftop. Four-stage field experiments under various ambient temperatures were conducted on the roof of a typical residential townhouse in the Taichung metropolitan area, in central Taiwan, which has a warm oceanic climate/humid subtropical climate (Cfa). The results indicated that the bottom temperature of the perennial herb, shrub, vine, and groundcover green roofs were lower than the bare rooftop temperature by 17.75 degrees C, 12.57 degrees C, 11.55 degrees C, and 9.31 degrees C, respectively. The heat amplitude reductions of the bare rooftop were defined as 1 minus the result of dividing the experimental temperature fluctuation by the rooftop temperature fluctuation; the heat amplitude reductions attributed to the shrub and perennial herb green roofs were similar (83.32% and 82.58%, respectively); smaller reductions were produced by the vine (79.78%) and groundcover (74.88%) roofs. Moreover, air temperature and solar radiation were positively related to temperature reduction of the bare rooftop, and relative humidity was negatively related to temperature reduction. Finally, plants in extensive green roofs can further reduce the surface temperature of a bare rooftop when compared with that of bare soil roofs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recent experimental and field studies on temperate shallow lakes indicate that nitrogen may play a greater role in their functioning than previously thought. Several studies document that abundance and richness of submerged macrophytes, both central in shallow lake ecology, may decrease with increasing nitrogen loading, especially at high phosphorus levels. However, the role of nitrogen in warm lakes with fluctuating water regimes remains to be described in detail. 2. The effect of increasing nitrate and phosphate concentrations on submerged macrophyte growth was examined in a 3-month mesocosm experiment conducted in summer in a shallow freshwater lake on the north western coast of Turkey with a Mediterranean climate. Twenty four field mesocosms, open to the sediment and atmosphere, were stocked with Myriophyllum spicatum shoots and small cyprinid fish. Three nitrate loadings in combination with two phosphate loadings were applied in a fourfold replicated design. 3. Mean +/- SD nutrient concentrations maintained throughout the experiment were 0.55 +/- 0.17, 2.2 +/- 0.97, 9.2 +/- 5.45 mg L-1 total nitrogen and 55 +/- 19.2, 73 +/- 22.9 mu g L-1 total phosphorus. Mean periphyton biomass increased with increasing nutrient concentrations and peaked at the highest nitrogen and phosphorus loadings, while the mean phytoplankton biomass remained relatively low in all treatments. 4. Percent volume inhabited (% PVI) by macrophytes throughout the experiment and total macrophyte biomass at the end of the experiment did not differ among treatments. In addition to stocked M. spicatum, Ceratophyllum demersum and Potamogeton crispus appeared in the majority of the mesocosms. The plants grew continuously up to 50% PVI throughout the experiment and remained resilient to shading provided by periphyton and phytoplankton. 5. The mean summer air temperature in 2007 was 2.2 degrees C higher than the average of the last 32 years, which resulted in a water level decrease of 0.3 m in the mesocosms over three months. This might have counteracted the shading of submerged macrophytes provided by phytoplankton and periphyton. The results of the experiment are consistent with observations of higher macrophyte resilience to nutrient loading in Mediterranean lakes compared with northern temperate lakes.",,,,,"Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012; Ozkan, Korhan/AAR-8775-2021; Özkan, Korhan/C-5013-2011; beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019","Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X; Ozkan, Korhan/0000-0003-1911-6508; Özkan, Korhan/0000-0003-1911-6508; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,FEB,2010,55,2,,,,,463,475,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02297.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02297.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000273602500015,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Esau, I",,,,"Esau, Igor",,,Indirect air-sea interactions simulated with a coupled turbulence-resolving model,OCEAN DYNAMICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"A turbulence-resolving parallelized atmospheric large-eddy simulation model (PALM) has been applied to study turbulent interactions between the humid atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and the salt water oceanic mixed layer (OML). The most energetic three-dimensional turbulent eddies in the ABL-OML system (convective cells) were explicitly resolved in these simulations. This study considers a case of shear-free convection in the coupled ABL-OML system. The ABL-OML coupling scheme used the turbulent fluxes at the bottom of the ABL as upper boundary conditions for the OML and the sea surface temperature at the top of the OML as lower boundary conditions for the ABL. The analysis of the numerical experiment confirms that the ABL-OML interactions involve both the traditional direct coupling mechanism and much less studied indirect coupling mechanism (Garrett Dyn Atmos Ocean 23:19-34, 1996). The direct coupling refers to a common flux-gradient representation of the air-sea exchange, which is controlled by the temperature difference across the air-water interface. The indirect coupling refers to thermal instability of the Rayleigh-Benard convection, which is controlled by the temperature difference across the entire mixed layer through formation of the large convective eddies or cells. The indirect coupling mechanism in these simulations explained up to 45 % of the ABL-OML co-variability on the turbulent scales. Despite relatively small amplitude of the sea surface temperature fluctuations, persistence of the OML cells organizes the ABL convective cells. Water downdrafts in the OML cells tend to be collocated with air updrafts in the ABL cells. The study concludes that the convective structures in the ABL and the OML are co-organized. The OML convection controls the air-sea turbulent exchange in the quasi-equilibrium convective ABL-OML system.",,,,,"Esau, Igor/AAG-9769-2021","Esau, Igor/0000-0003-4122-6340",,,,,,,,,,,,,1616-7341,1616-7228,,,,MAY,2014,64,5,,,,,689,705,,10.1007/s10236-014-0712-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-014-0712-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000335669200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

One prediction is that high levels of dispersal synchronize density fluctuations between subpopulations. However, little is still known about how biotic and abiotic factors combine to modify the effects of dispersal rate on synchrony and metapopulation dynamics. In a fully factorial experimental design, we investigated the combined effects of (1) dispersal, (2) parasite infection, and (3) synchrony in temperature fluctuations on subpopulation synchrony, metapopulation instability, and minimum population size, in laboratory metapopulations of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum. Metapopulations, comprising two subpopulations linked by high or low levels of dispersal, were exposed to daily fluctuations in temperature between permissive (23 degrees C) and restrictive (5 degrees C) conditions. Infected metapopulations started the experiment with one subpopulation uninfected, while the other was infected at a prevalence of 5% with the bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. The temperature synchrony treatment involved subpopulations within a metapopulation following the same (synchronous temperatures) or different (asynchronous temperatures) temporal sequences. Population size was tracked over the 56-day experiment. We found that subpopulation density fluctuations were synchronized by high dispersal in infected metapopulations, and by synchronous temperatures in all metapopulations. Subpopulation synchrony was positively correlated with metapopulation instability and minimum metapopulation size, highlighting the multiple consequences of our treatments for metapopulation dynamics. Our results illustrate how parasites can generate dispersal-driven synchrony in non-cycling, declining populations. This biotic forcing via a natural enemy added to the temperature-dependent environmental forcing. We therefore conclude that predictions of metapopulation persistence in natural populations require simultaneous investigation of multiple ecological and epidemiological factors.",,,,,"Gonzalez, Andrew/F-2247-2010","Gonzalez, Andrew/0000-0001-6075-8081",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JAN,2015,96,1,,,,,284,290,,10.1890/14-0137.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/14-0137.1,,,,,,,,26236913,,,,,WOS:000349198900031,View Full Record in Web of Science

Phospholipid vesicles prepared from the gills of mussels acclimated for 6 weeks to constant high or low temperatures in the laboratory fail to exhibit temperature-compensatory differences in order, In addition, during the summer, mussels inhabiting high intertidal sites, but not those from low sites, possess the ability to alter membrane order rapidly (within hours), This alteration of order appears to represent a mechanism designed to offset the thermal variations encountered during the tidal cycle, Thus, M. californianus have the ability to adjust membrane order on seasonal as well as hourly time scales and do so on the basis of their height in the intertidal region.",,,,,"Somero, George/AAC-3321-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,JUL,1996,199,7,,,,,1587,1596,,,,,,,,,,,9319489,,,,,WOS:A1996UW87800017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increased foliage temperature (2.5 degrees C above fluctuating ambient) was induced by heating the stand with infrared radiation sources, modulated by an electronic control device (FATI, Free Air Temperature Increase). Enhanced CO2 was produced by a FACE system (Free Air CO2 Enrichment). Exposure to simulated climate warming drastically reduced above-ground harvestable dry matter (52% loss). The nitrogen allocated to the leaf fraction was thus concentrated into less dry matter, which enhanced the nitrogen concentration on a mass basis (+17%) but also per unit leaf area (+47%). As a consequence, CO, assimilation rates were not affected in these slower growing plants in the +2.5 degrees C treatment, and the photochemical efficiency of non-cyclic electron transport of photosystem II was also unaffected. Although the plants were grown in the field without root restrictions, long-term exposure to elevated CO, concentration induced noticeable acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus (40% loss of fixation potential), which largely outweighed the direct stimulation in this summer period. Part of the reduced rates could be attributed to lower N concentration on a leaf area basis. The results are compared with responses of this species in sunlit conditioned greenhouses, which indicates that experiments in enclosures may underestimate effects in the field. This also emphasizes the need to validate other plant responses to climate warming and CO2 enrichment in free air conditions.",,,,,,"Nijs, Ivan/0000-0003-3111-680X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0098-8472,,,,,OCT,1996,36,3,,,,,271,280,,10.1016/0098-8472(96)01021-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0098-8472(96)01021-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VJ70900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Guided by a number of experimental findings, we build the case for a novel microtubule model, with the principal result that microtubules can spontaneously form micron-sized cooperative helical states with unique elastic and dynamic features. The polymorphic dynamics of the microtubule lattice resulting from the tubulin bistability quantitatively explains several experimental puzzles, including anomalous scaling of dynamic fluctuations of grafted microtubules, their apparent length-stiffness relation, and their remarkable curved-helical appearance in general.

To examine the effects of training regimes on swimming performance of juvenile bream Megalobrama pellegrini (5.10 +/- 0.08 g), fish were held in slow-flowing water (control), or subjected to exercise training at 1 body length (BL) s(-1), 2 BL s(-1) or 4 BL s(-1), or were given exhaustive chasing training daily for 5 wk at 25 degrees C. Aerobic swimming performance was assessed by measuring critical swimming speed (U-crit).

U-crit was significantly higher in the 4 BL s(-1) training group than in the controls. The value of U-crit was 5% greater for the exhaustive training group compared with the control group, although exhaustive chasing training did not have a significant effect on U-crit.

This study examined the relationships between water depth, water quality and algae in shallow agricultural lakes in the lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB) to assess how lake depth influences algal structure and function, focusing on factors that typically regulate growth, that is, light, temperature and nutrients. Lake water and sediment cores were collected in shallow (mean = 0.8 m) and deep (mean = 1.7 m) locations in three lakes seasonally for 1 year. Additionally, interactive effects of light and temperature on algal growth were investigated through a laboratory experiment to determine the relative importance of each in regulating algal biomass and net oxygen production. In these shallow, turbid, eutrophic lakes, deeper water had lower nutrient concentrations and temperature across all seasons and clearer water in the summer. Shallow areas had more phytoplankton and periphyton. Water temperature had a stronger correlation than light with both phytoplankton and periphyton biomass. Algal biomass generally decreased with increasing water temperature, but biomass was better predicted by increasing nitrogen availability, and productivity declined with greater phosphorus availability. Water depth was therefore likely influencing different locations of the same lake towards different algal stable states. Mitigating excess algal production is an important goal towards limiting hypoxic conditions in the LMRB, and increasing water storage could help moderate temperature, nutrients and turbidity effects that contribute to algal blooms in lakes receiving agricultural runoff.",,,,,,"Murdock, Justin/0000-0003-2447-6831",,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-0584,1936-0592,,,,SEP,2021,14,6,,,,,,,e2319,10.1002/eco.2319,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2319,,JUL 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000674007500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study aimed to evaluate the thermoregulatory behaviour of juveniles of L. santolla of different ages, maintained in laboratory conditions at 12 degrees C for 390 days and based on: i) temperature selected along a thermal gradient and ii) thermal window calculated as the tolerance temperature interval. Results demonstrate that age is a key factor to be considered in thermal tolerance studies, because the thermal tolerance can change, depending on the age and life cycle stages. The preferred temperature was 12 degrees C for animals aged between 45 d and 170 d and was 7.2 degrees C and 9.1 degrees C for crabs aged between 260 and 390 d, respectively. The critical thermal minimum (CTMin) significantly changed together with the age of crab; the highest value (4.2 degrees C) was for animals 260 d old and lowest for crabs 45 d old (1.5 degrees C). Critical thermal maximum values were also affected by age, with highest values for animals aged between 105 d and 170 d (27 degrees C to 27.6 degrees C). The temperature tolerance interval fluctuated between 20.5 degrees C and 25.5 degrees C. Crabs aged between 45 d and 260 d showed the narrowest interval (22.9 degrees C and 20.5 degrees C, respectively). Considering the thermal limits observed in the present study, a climate change scenario with an increasing frequency and intensity of extreme thermal events might affect the present distribution of the species. Temperature rises would allow L. santolla to explore higher latitudes, whereas a temperature decrease when juveniles are searching for a particular colder habitat, near to CTMin, might be detrimental to the population.

Intraseasonal variability and causes,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The huge freshwater flux of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM; May-October) gives rise to strong salinity stratification in the Bay of Bengal (BoB), causing a shallow mixed layer and a thick barrier layer, which potentially affects intraseasonal oscillations of the monsoon (MISOs). In this study, intraseasonal variability of the mixed-layer depth (MLD) and barrier layer thickness (BLT) is investigated using in situ observations from Argo floats and moored buoys and an ocean general circulation model (OGCM). The average MLD in the BoB is typically 20-30 m during the ISM, while the BLT increases from approximate to 10 m in May-June to 20-40 m in September-October. MISOs induce in-phase variations in MLD and isothermal layer depth (ILD), both of which are deepened by 8-15 m during MISO active phase, while the change of BLT is small and within the error range of Argo data sampling. In the northern (southern) bay, BLT increases by approximate to 5 m (2 m) during MISOs owing to a larger deepening of ILD than MLD. OGCM experiments are performed to understand the underlying mechanism. In the BoB intraseasonal variations of MLD, ILD and BLT arise largely from ocean internal instability, whereas those induced by MISOs are weaker. The in-phase variations of MLD and ILD during MISOs are induced by different processes. The MLD deepening is primarily caused by wind stress forcing, while the ILD deepening is driven by surface heat fluxes via surface cooling. The limited variability of BLT is due to the offsetting of different forcing processes.",,,,,"Lee, Tong/AAZ-6447-2020; Shinoda, Toshiaki/J-3745-2016; Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021; Shinoda, Toshiaki/S-1721-2019; Ravichandran, M./AAM-1351-2020","Lee, Tong/0000-0001-9817-2908; Shinoda, Toshiaki/0000-0003-1416-2206; Shinoda, Toshiaki/0000-0003-1416-2206; LI, YUANLONG/0000-0002-7239-5756; HAN, WEIQING/0000-0003-3633-9105",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,MAY,2017,122,5,,,,,4291,4311,,10.1002/2017JC012691,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JC012691,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000404363600042,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is the first disease-related die-off of a diadematid documented in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Diseased individuals showed deterioration of the epidermis and water-vascular system, resulting in epidermal necrosis and release of spines. Despite some spatial heterogeneity in disease incidence at the study sites, there was a 65% overall reduction in urchin abundance after the mortality event compared to numbers pre-mortality. However, the reduction in urchin numbers did not compromise the species' reproductive success; the settlement peak following the mortality event was of a similar magnitude to that in prior years. Bacterial isolation and culture techniques, and subsequent laboratory infection experiments, strongly suggested that Vibrio alginolyticus was involved in the disease. We hypothesize that the mass mortality event developed due to anomalously high seawater temperatures recorded in the 2 studied archipelagos and that warmer temperatures enabled infection of D. africanum by waterborne pathogenic bacteria.

Lapillus otoliths were used to estimate the daily ages of age-0 Channel Catfish, for which hatch dates were back-calculated. We performed growth analysis to determine growth histories of each fish at 20-d increments from hatch. Across the 2 years of sampling, Channel Catfish hatches were documented from June 7 to September 15. Ages and growth rates of age-0 Channel Catfish ranged from 20 to 126 d and 0.60 to 1.5 mm/d, respectively. In general, growth was highest among age-0 Channel Catfish from unregulated sites in the lower Coastal Plain, lowest among fish from unregulated sites in the Piedmont, and intermediate from regulated sites in the Piedmont. Successful hatching typically occurred during periods when mean discharges were in the upper two quartiles of flows for each site but not during exceptionally high peaks in flow. Physiographic province, the frequency of high pulses, and the number of flow reversals were the most important factors influencing the growth of recently hatched Channel Catfish. Results suggest that a low to moderate frequency of high pulses (25-150 pulses per 20-d increment) and a moderate number of flow reversals (similar to 100-175 reversals per 20-d increment) enhances early growth of Channel Catfish in the Tallapoosa River system.

Data acquisition was based on experimental fishing performed from 1999 to 2013 and from historical fishing records. Two alternative fish assemblage configurations were identified by cluster analysis. Odontesthes bonariensis, Parapimelodus valenciennis and Cyphocharax voga were the dominant species, which accounted for 70-80% of the relative abundance. The species O. bonariensis showed temporal fluctuations in its representativeness, changing from dominant to almost absent, whereas C. voga and P. valenciennis changed their abundance following a similar pattern along time. When historical data were considered, Platanichthys platana appeared as the fourth most relevant species. Precipitation, critical temperatures and fish mortalities were identified as the main drivers of species abundance shifts.

Cooler rearing temperatures (15 degrees C) resulted in larger, darker winter morph (WM) adults than summer morph flies reared at optimal temperatures (25 degrees C). Abdominal pigmentation scores and body size measurements of laboratory-reared WMs were similar to those of D. suzukii females captured in late autumn in Geneva, NY.

Precipitation extremes are considered at a wide range of time scales from hourly to multi-day amounts and in individual seasons (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON). We focus on (1) the dependence of the results on the time scale of precipitation aggregation, (2) seasonal differences, (3) uncertainties of the scenarios related to differences amongst the RCM simulations, and (iv) identification of regions and seasons in which the projected changes in precipitation extremes are particularly large and/or robust in the RCM ensemble. The examined ensemble of RCM simulations captures basic precipitation patterns for the recent climate (1961-90), including seasonal changes. Climate change scenarios for the late 21st century differ substantially for short-term (hourly) and multi-day (5-day and 15-day) precipitation extremes, mainly in the western Mediterranean. Projected increases in short-term extremes exceed those of daily and multi-day extremes, and occur even in regions and seasons in which mean precipitation is projected to decline. This change in the patterns of extreme precipitation may have important hydrological consequences, with increases in the severity of flash floods in a warmer climate in spite of the overall drying projected for the region. However, uncertainty of the scenarios of precipitation extremes related to within-ensemble variability is large. Consistency of the projected changes amongst the RCMs is highest in winter and lowest in summer, and generally it is higher for short-term than multi-day extremes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Animals may respond to fluctuation in the thermal environment by regulating their body temperature and by modifying physiological and biochemical rates. Phenotypic flexibility (reversible phenotypic plasticity, acclimation, or acclimatisation) in rate functions occurs in all major taxonomic groups and may be considered as an ancestral condition. Within the Reptilia, representatives from all major groups show phenotypic flexibility in response to long-term or chronic changes in the thermal environment. Acclimation or acclimatisation in reptiles are most commonly assessed by measuring whole animal responses such as oxygen consumption, but whole animal responses are comprised of variation in individual traits such as enzyme activities, hormone expression, and cardiovascular functions. The challenge now lies in connecting the changes in the components to the functioning of the whole animal and its fitness. Experimental designs in research on reptilian thermal physiology should incorporate the capacity for reversible phenotypic plasticity as a null-hypothesis, because the significance of differential body temperature-performance relationships (thermal reaction norms) between individuals, populations, or species cannot be assessed without testing that null-hypothesis.",,,,,,"Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311",,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,1432-136X,,,,OCT,2005,175,7,,,,,453,461,,10.1007/s00360-005-0010-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-005-0010-6,,,,,,,,16034580,,,,,WOS:000233241600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of application rate of blood meal (BM) and feather meal (FM) fertilizers on germination of tomato seeds. Both organic fertilizers were applied as amendments to peat-based organic substrates at rates ranging from 0 to over 50 g.kg(-1) N. Tomato 'Brandywine' seed were sown in trays. Seed germination was recorded daily until the germination percentage remained unchanged. Ammonia concentration in the substrates (Pro-Mix and Miracle-Gro) increased with increasing rate of substrate N concentration. Ammonia concentration also increased with increasing time after incorporation of BM and FM reaching maximum values (16 ppm) at day 9. Tomato seed germination was little affected at BM and FM rates lower than approximate to 3 g.kg(-1) N (4% w/w for BM or FM), but declined above 3 g.kg(-1) N reaching 0% germination rate at approximate to 14 g.kg(-1) N for both BM and FM. Substrates pH was 5.9 in the absence of BM or FM and increased to about pH 7 with addition of low rates of BM (2.7 g.kg(-1) N) and FM (2.6 g.kg(-1) N). Substrate electrical conductivity (EC) increased with increasing substrate N concentration as supplied by BM and FM; FM, however, had a stronger effect on increasing EC compared with BM. In conclusion, BM and FM had inhibitory effects on tomato seed germination when applied at more than 3 g.kg(-1) N (4% w/w for BM or FM). High ammonia concentration in the substrates for the first 2 weeks after incorporation of BM or FM likely caused, at least partially, inhibition of tomato seed germination.

Primary productivity was negatively correlated with ice-out date and positively correlated with primary productivity during the previous year (r(2) = 0.47). Alternatively, primary productivity was positively correlated with water temperature and primary productivity during the previous year (r(2) = 0.49). Ammonium availability immediately after ice-out was significantly related to primary productivity from the previous and the current year, suggesting that nutrient availability is an important mechanism for the serial correlation.

Mey. to enhance sustainable agricultural production,AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"In this study, seeds of Lebeckia ambigua E. Mey., a South African perennial legume, displayed a high level of physical dormancy, commonly termed 'hardseededness'. In Australian agricultural systems, this trait is exploited in annual legumes to ensure their regeneration after a cropping phase. While hardseededness in annual legumes has been studied extensively, there have been fewer studies of this feature in perennial legumes. Here, for the first time, we examine the conditions required for hard seed breakdown in L. ambigua, with experiments undertaken in both the field and laboratory. The annual legumes Ornithopus sativus Brot. and Biserrula pelecinus L. were included for comparison. More than 50% of the hard seed of L. ambigua, when buried at 0.5 cm for 87 weeks, remained hard, and 25% were still hard after 188 weeks. We are also the first to demonstrate genetic variation in hard seed breakdown patterns of L. ambigua when buried at 0.5 cm. In the laboratory, L. ambigua seed softened after exposure to a temperature of 80 degrees C for 2-8 days in a dry oven and also after reaching 60 degrees C in a cycling temperature oven, with fluctuating humidity. Seed of L. ambigua produced in two different geographic regions of Western Australia and then buried at 0.5 or 4 cm in the soil, at two softening locations, became differentially soft over 188 weeks. There was a significant three-way interaction between burial depth, site and maternal influences (P<0.01) on hard seed breakdown. The pattern of hard seed breakdown revealed in this perennial legume reflects that described for pyrogenic species and does not fit the models developed by agricultural researchers for annual legumes. Understanding the ecological triggers for release of seeds of L. ambigua from dormancy has provided opportunities for exploitation of this trait in future sustainable agricultural development.",,,,,"; Edwards, Tom/R-6585-2018","Steel, Emma/0000-0002-2299-3408; Harrison, Robert/0000-0001-7179-4678; Edwards, Tom/0000-0003-1470-5098",,,,,,,,,,,,,1774-0746,1773-0155,,,,AUG,2021,41,4,,,,,,,45,10.1007/s13593-021-00704-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-021-00704-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000662326100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two experiments were performed to determine the effects of salinity on survival, growth and haemolymph osmolality of early juvenile P. pelagicus crabs. The salinities tested for the first experiment were 10, 15, 25 and 40 ppt, and for the second experiment 5, 20, 30, 35 and 45 ppt. Each salinity experiment was triplicated, with each replicate consisting of 10 stage 4 juveniles. Each experiment lasted 45 days. Mortalities and incidence of molt death syndrome were recorded daily, while the intermolt period, carapace length, carapace width and wet weight were measured at each molt. At the end of the experiments the haemolymph osmolality and dry weights were measured. Results demonstrate that salinity significantly affects both the survival and growth of early P. pelagicus juveniles. Mortality was significantly higher (p < 0.01) for juveniles cultured at salinities :5 15 ppt and at 45 ppt. At a salinity of 5 ppt a complete mortality occurred on day 20. In all salinity treatments, the majority of mortalities were due to molt death syndrome. In experiment 1, immediate effects of salinity on growth and development were seen at 10 ppt as the intermolt period was significantly longer (p < 0.01) and the mean carapace size increase was significantly less (p < 0.01) at the first molt compared to the other treatments. Meanwhile, the specific growth rates (carapace length, width and wet weight) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) at high salinities 40 ppt) due to longer intermolt periods and significantly lower (p < 0.05) carapace size or wet weight increases. The haemolymph osmolality exhibited a positive linear relationship with the culture medium with an isosmotic point of 1106 mOsm/kg, equal to a salinity of approximately 38 ppt. Based on the osmolality graph, high metabolic cost for osmoregulation due to increased hyper- and hypo-osmotic stress appeared to cause lower survival and specific growth rates of the crabs. The results demonstrate that a salinity range of 20-35 ppt is suitable for the culture of early juvenile P. pelagicus. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The dynamic upper-ocean variability in the POCM is examined in response to changes in daily European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts wind stresses across the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean (31 degreesS-31 degreesN) between 1983 and 1989. The POCM provides a complete and physically consistent representation of the state of the Pacific Ocean, with the phase of the thermocline depth anomalies being consistent with the observed El Nino/ La Nina variations in the near-equatorial zone and southwest Pacific during the decade. A series of vorticity model sensitivity experiments, incorporating scaled Rossby wave speeds based on recent observations from the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite altimeter, is used to examine and compare the phase and amplitude variations in the depth of the internal surface against changes in the depth of the 14 degreesC isotherm (D14, used as a proxy for the depth of the thermocline, or pycnocline) as simulated in the POCM. This study demonstrates that the simple linear vorticity model can reproduce the Pacific Ocean thermocline depth anomalies in the interior of the subtropical gyres as simulated by the POCM. These variations are both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with an ocean forced by only Ekman pumping and Rossby waves that traverse the basin, with isolated topographic and background influences. Further, a number of experiments demonstrate that the phase similarities, from correlation analyses, between results from the POCM and those from the simple dynamical model are statistically significant (at the 95% level) across the majority of the 11 degreesS, 11 degreesN, and 21 degreesN transects in the western, central, or eastern Pacific basin. At 11 degrees and 21 degrees latitude, the amplitude of the variability is similarly comparable across much of the basin. The model is generally less successful at 31 degrees latitude where higher baroclinic modes of the mean flow become important.",,,,,"Holbrook, Neil J/M-7544-2013","Holbrook, Neil J/0000-0002-3523-6254",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,,,,,,2001,31,7,,,,,1786,1806,,10.1175/1520-0485(2001)031<1786:CPOTDA>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(2001)031<1786:CPOTDA>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000169774800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

To estimate the conditions necessary for C. antiqua red tide outbreaks we developed an ecological model for diel vertical migration and nocturnal nutrient uptake. The model was expressed as vertically one-dimensional differential equations for PO43-, NO3-, NO4+, C. antiqua cell concentration, P cell quota, and N cell quota. To deal with diel vertical migration, the growth function was given by the Droop equation and nutrient uptake kinetics were given by the Michaelis-Menten equation. The model was calibrated with several sets of experimental data. Model calculations showed that the formation of a shallow nutricline (at similar to 6 m) was crucial for rapid growth of C. antiqua. Given that a shallow nutricline was formed, the calculation also suggested that;other environmental factors have to be within certain ranges for C. antiqua red tides to occur. If the retention time was <6 d or the grazing pressure was more intensive than that caused by 40 ind. liter(-1) of Paracalanus parvus, which feeds on C. antiqua, there was no chance for an outbreak in a bay of the Seto Inland Sea. Weak wind periods, which often occur in the Seto Inland Sea during summer, seem to enhance the chances of a C. antiqua red tide outbreak by strengthening water column stratification and making the water stagnant. If this occurs after a shallow nutricline has formed and active C. antiqua cells are present, which can be attributed to excystment at the bottom, then the conditions necessary for C. antiqua red tide outbreaks will be satisfied. Excystment occurs when temperatures rise (to similar to 20-22 degrees C), often due to intrusion of warm, saline Kuroshio Current water The conditions predicted by our model as necessary for C. antiqua red tides are consistent with this hypothesis. Our model quantitatively supports the hypothesis that C. antiqua can grow to the level of red tides by exploiting the unique environmental conditions found in the Seto Inland Sea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,,,,,JAN,1998,43,1,,,,,117,128,,10.4319/lo.1998.43.1.0117,http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.1.0117,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000073694200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is also known that mitochondria can play a key role in setting an ectothermic species' thermal tolerance. In this study, we aimed to characterize the mitochondrial thermo-tolerance in invasive and endemic freshwater mussels. With the use of high-resolution respirometry, we analyzed the mitochondrial respiration of two freshwater bivalve species exposed to a broad range of temperatures. We noticed that the invasive dreissenid Dreissena bugensis possessed a less thermo-tolerant mitochondrial metabolism than the endemic unionid Elliptio complanata. This lack of tolerance was linked with a more noticeable aerobic metabolic depression at elevated temperatures. This decrease in mitochondrial metabolic activity was also linked with an increase in leak oxygen consumption as well as a stable maintenance of the activity of cytochrome c oxidase in both species. These findings may be associated both with the species' life history characteristics, as D. bugensis is more adapted to unstable habitats, in which selection pressures for resistance adaptations are reduced. Our findings add to the growing body of literature characterizing the mitochondrial metabolism of many aquatic ectotherms in our changing world.",,,,,"; Boisclair, Daniel/AAS-2345-2020","Bettinazzi, Stefano/0000-0002-1129-0678; Boisclair, Daniel/0000-0002-4353-9597; Hraoui, Georges/0000-0002-5475-9915",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JAN,2020,223,2,,,,,,,jeb215921,10.1242/jeb.215921,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.215921,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000541780500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

High physiological tolerance allows estuarine-dependent species to take advantage of productive habitats; but abiotic variability can have a strong bearing on early growth and recruitment dynamics. Using spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) as a model estuarine-dependent species, we employed a multifaceted approach to examine abiotic influence on early growth by integrating data from a controlled growth experiment, continuous records of field conditions, and otolith growth records from the field. We asked whether fluctuation in early growth was controlled by the two primary abiotic variables, water temperature and salinity. Fluctuation in field growth was compared with expected fluctuation derived from laboratory growth parameters and abiotic variation experienced by juvenile spot in the field. Fluctuation in expected daily growth cross-correlated significantly with actual growth inferred from otolith microstructure over a 76 day field-growth period (r = 0.363; P < 0.001); however, the relationship was not strong enough to predict growth fluctuation. Moreover, high individual variability in inferred growth points to the importance of other abiotic and biotic variables. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To characterise spatiotemporal variability in T. peregrinus abundance and the factors that might influence it, we monitored adult population densities at six sites in the main eucalypt growing regions of South Africa. At each site, twenty yellow sticky traps were monitored weekly for 30 months, together with climatic data.

The cultivation and production of these crops are expected to be affected by climate change and elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, and have drawn considerable public attention. The objective of this experiment was to understand the impact of future climate change (including increased temperature and changed precipitation patterns) and elevated CO2 concentration on variations of crop yields in their suitable planting areas. We conducted a spatial grid-based analysis of maize, rice, and wheat yields using projections of future climate generated by a multi-model ensemble of global climate models for three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) in suitable planting areas in China for the 2030s (2021-2040) and the 2050s (2041-2060). Suitable areas for the planting of maize, rice, and wheat under the high-emission scenarios migrated slightly northward over time. Yield of all three crops would be expected to remain stable or to slightly increase across China in the future. A possible reason for this result may be because the positive effects of increased precipitation and CO2 offset the negative effect of increased temperature on crop yields, resulting in a much more appropriate growth environment and increased biomass accumulation and crop yield. In addition, this study also indicated that changes in crop yields were mainly driven by temperature and CO2 factors. The potential effects of climate change and elevated CO2 concentration on migration of planting areas and yield fluctuations for crops should be given greater attention in the future.",,,,,"; Yu, Qiang/D-3702-2009","Zhang, Yajie/0000-0002-4978-6249; Yu, Qiang/0000-0001-6950-1821",,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,JUN,2021,125,,,,,,,,107588,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107588,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107588,,MAR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000637798700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, as in other plant-measured approaches, the irrigation decision may be difficult due to the influence of the environment on the values obtained. Reference equations of MDS have been established in order to avoid the effects of environmental conditions. Such equations are usually related to simple meteorological data, in order to easily estimate MDS values in full-irrigated conditions. This paper studies the influence of fruit load and the inter-annual variations on the reference equation of MDS in olive trees. These reference equations were calculated during 4 seasons in a full-irrigated orchard and the equations were validated with the data from a different season. The MDS values were related to vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature taken near the experimental orchard. In addition, meteorological data were considered as mean daily or as midday values: only for temperature was the maximum daily value also used. The validation of the equations was made using the fits with all the meteorological data considered (midday and mean daily of VPD and temperature). In addition, two different fits were used in each meteorological data one according to fruit load and other with the complete pool of data. The equations fit were significantly different each season in all the meteorological data considered. However, seasons with similar fruit load were more similar to each other. In both meteorological data considered (VPD and temperature) the midday values improved the fit in respect to mean daily values. The equations obtained with maximum daily temperature were similar in accuracy to the one of midday. The reference equations in which temperature was used obtained a better fit that the ones calculated with VPD. No significant differences were found in the validation when equations according to fruit load or the complete pool data were compared. The limitations and usefulness of these reference equations are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There was no evidence of any trend in variable temperature environments. Three non-exclusive mechanisms might explain the lack of a net stabilising effect of species richness on temporal change. (1) A direct destabilising effect of diversity on population level variances caused some populations to vary more when embedded in more diverse communities.

There is increasing evidence suggesting that, in addition to other environmental factors, climate change is affecting species distributions and local population dynamics. Additionally, as a consequence of the growing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), the oceans are taking up increasing amounts of this CO2, causing ocean pH to decrease (ocean acidification). The relative impacts of ocean acidification on population dynamics have yet to be investigated, despite many studies indicating that there will be at least a sublethal impact on many marine organisms, particularly key calcifying organisms. Using empirical data, we forced a barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) population model to investigate the relative influence of sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean acidification on a population nearing the southern limit of its geographic distribution. Hindcast models were compared to observational data from Cellar Beach (southwestern United Kingdom). Results indicate that a declining pH trend (-0.0017 unit/yr), indicative of ocean acidification over the past 50 years, does not cause an observable impact on the population abundance relative to changes caused by fluctuations in temperature. Below the critical temperature (here T-crit = 13.1 degrees C), pH has a more significant affect on population dynamics at this southern range edge. However, above this value, SST has the overriding influence. At lower SST, a decrease in pH (according to the National Bureau of Standards, pH(NBS)) from 8.2 to 7.8 can significantly decrease the population abundance. The lethal impacts of ocean acidification observed in experiments on early life stages reduce cumulative survival by similar to 25%, which again will significantly alter the population level at this southern limit. Furthermore, forecast predictions from this model suggest that combined acidification and warming cause this local population to die out 10 years earlier than would occur if there was only global warming and no concomitant decrease in pH.",,,,,"Burrows, Michael/ABF-4844-2020; Burrows, Michael T/D-9844-2013","Burrows, Michael/0000-0003-4620-5899; Burrows, Michael T/0000-0003-4620-5899",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,OCT,2010,91,10,,,,,2931,2940,,10.1890/09-1987.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/09-1987.1,,,,,,,,21058553,,,,,WOS:000282654700012,View Full Record in Web of Science

W.",,,"Biophysics, environmental stochasticity, and the evolution of thermal safety margins in intertidal limpets",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"As the air temperature of the Earth rises, ecological relationships within a community might shift, in part due to differences in the thermal physiology of species. Prediction of these shifts - an urgent task for ecologists - will be complicated if thermal tolerance itself can rapidly evolve. Here, we employ a mechanistic approach to predict the potential for rapid evolution of thermal tolerance in the intertidal limpet Lottia gigantea. Using biophysical principles to predict body temperature as a function of the state of the environment, and an environmental bootstrap procedure to predict how the environment fluctuates through time, we create hypothetical time-series of limpet body temperatures, which are in turn used as a test platform for a mechanistic evolutionary model of thermal tolerance. Our simulations suggest that environmentally driven stochastic variation of L.. gigantea body temperature results in rapid evolution of a substantial 'safety margin' : the average lethal limit is 5-7 degrees C above the average annual maximum temperature. This predicted safety margin approximately matches that found in nature, and once established is sufficient, in our simulations, to allow some limpet populations to survive a drastic, century-long increase in air temperature. By contrast, in the absence of environmental stochasticity, the safety margin is dramatically reduced. We suggest that the risk of exceeding the safety margin, rather than the absolute value of the safety margin, plays an underappreciated role in the evolution of thermal tolerance. Our predictions are based on a simple, hypothetical, allelic model that connects genetics to thermal physiology. To move beyond this simple model - and thereby potentially to predict differential evolution among populations and among species - will require significant advances in our ability to translate the details of thermal histories into physiological and population-genetic consequences.",,,,,,"Dowd, W.

We here studied physiological plasticity in cold tolerance in Ophraella communa LeSage (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a potential biological control agent of an invasive plant, the common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.

We found that SCP, water, and glycerol contents of beetles fluctuated significantly with season. Glycerol content of males and females increased with decreasing temperature between July and October, and glycerol content reached a maximum in October in the field. The lowest SCP was observed in adults in October prior to overwintering, and the highest SCP was evident in the summer population in July. Thus, cold hardiness of the beetles in the autumn population was significantly higher than in the summer population.

Mean daily food intake by A. jamaicensis and R. aegyptiacus ranged from 1.1-1.6 times body mass and 0.8-1.0 times body mass, respectively. Dry matter digestibility and metabolizable E coefficient were high (81.1% and 82.4%, respectively) for A. jamaicensis and (77.5% and 78.0%, respectively) for R. aegyptiacus. Across the four diets, bats maintained constant body mass with mean metabolizable E intakes ranging from 1357.3 kJ kg(-0.75). day(-1) to 1767.3 kJ kg(-0.75).day(-1) for A. jamaicensis and 1282.6-1545.2 kJ kg(-0.75). day(-1) for R. aegyptiacus. Maintenance E costs were high, in the order of 3.6-5.4 times the basal metabolic rate (BMR). It is unlikely that the E intakes that we observed represent a true measure of maintenance E requirements. All evidence seems to indicate that fruit bats are E maximizers, ingesting more E than required and regulating storage by adjusting metabolic output. We suggest that true maintenance E requirements are substantially lower than what we observed. If it follows the eutherian norm of two times the BMR, fruit bats must necessarily over-ingest E on low-N fruit diet. Dietary E content did affect N metabolism of A. jamaicensis. On respective low- and high-E diets, metabolic fecal N were 0.492 mg N g(-1) and 0.756 mg N g(-1) dry matter intake and endogenous urinary N losses were 163.31 mg N kg(-0.75) day(-1) and 71.54 mg N kg(-0.75) day(-1) A. jamaicensis required 332.3 mg kg(-0.75) day(-1) and 885.3 mg kg(-0.75) day(-1) of total N on high and low-E diets, respectively, and 213.7mg kg(-0.75) day(-1) of truly digestible N to achieve N balance. True N digestibilities were low (29% and 49%) for low- and high-E diets, respectively. For R. aegyptiacus, metabolic fecal N and endogenous urinary N losses were 1.27 mg N g(-1) dry matter intake and 96.0 mg N kg(-0.75). day(-1) respectively, and bats required 529.8 mg kg(-0.75) day(-1) (total N) or 284.0 mg kg(-0.75). day(-1) (truly digestible N). True N digestibility was relatively low (50%). Based on direct comparison, we found no evidence that R. aegyptiacus exhibits a greater degree of specialization in digestive function and N retention than A. jamaicensis. When combined with results from previous studies, our results indicate that all fruit bats appear to be specialized in their ability to retain N when faced with low N diet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,1432-136X,,,,MAR,1999,169,2,,,,,123,132,,10.1007/s003600050202,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003600050202,,,,,,,,10227185,,,,,WOS:000079550200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Under such conditions, ABPs display a persistent circular motion which allows the determination of the orientational work fluctuations along its trajectory. Due to the nonlinear coupling to the non-Markovian bath, we find strong deviations from the work fluctuation theorem (WFT) due to observed increased rotational ABP dynamics. Taking this enhanced rotational diffusion into account, the orientational work distributions can be recasted to be in accordance with the WFT by considering an effective temperature of about two orders of magnitude larger than kBT.

Asynchronous species dynamics may buffer against such variability when a decrease in performance by some species is offset by an increase in performance of others. However, high climatic variability can eliminate species through stochastic extinctions or cause similar stress responses among species that reduce buffering. Local conditions, such as soil nutrients, can also alter production stability directly or by influencing asynchrony. We test these hypotheses using a globally distributed sampling experiment. Location Grasslands in North America, Europe and Australia. Time period Annual surveys over 5 year intervals occurring between 2007 and 2014. Major taxa studied Herbaceous plants. Methods We sampled annually the per species cover and aboveground community biomass [net primary productivity (NPP)], plus soil chemical properties, in 29 grasslands. We tested how soil conditions, combined with variability in precipitation and temperature, affect species richness, asynchrony and temporal stability of primary productivity. We used bivariate relationships and structural equation modelling to examine proximate and ultimate relationships. Results Climate variability strongly predicted asynchrony, whereas NPP stability was more related to soil conditions. Species richness was structured by both climate variability and soils and, in turn, increased asynchrony. Variability in temperature and precipitation caused a unimodal asynchrony response, with asynchrony being lowest at low and high climate variability. Climate impacted stability indirectly, through its effect on asynchrony, with stability increasing at higher asynchrony owing to lower inter-annual variability in NPP. Soil conditions had no detectable effect on asynchrony but increased stability by increasing the mean NPP, especially when soil organic matter was high. Main conclusions We found globally consistent evidence that climate modulates species asynchrony but that the direct effect on stability is low relative to local soil conditions. Nonetheless, our observed unimodal responses to variability in temperature and precipitation suggest asynchrony thresholds, beyond which there are detectable destabilizing impacts of climate on primary productivity.",,,,,"Knops, Johannes/AAA-8546-2020; Mortensen, Brent/AAD-2092-2021; Akasaka, Munemitsu/G-1172-2013; Bakker, Jonathan/I-6960-2013; Hautier, Yann/I-2526-2019; Fay, Philip A./I-1853-2012; Grace, James/B-8472-2009; Gilbert, Benjamin/E-6616-2010","Mortensen, Brent/0000-0002-4873-6127; Akasaka, Munemitsu/0000-0002-0143-0841; Bakker, Jonathan/0000-0002-8973-2771; Hautier, Yann/0000-0003-4347-7741; Fay, Philip A./0000-0002-8291-6316; Grace, James/0000-0001-6374-4726; Lind, Eric/0000-0003-3051-7724; Borer, Elizabeth/0000-0003-2259-5853; Gilbert, Benjamin/0000-0002-4947-6822",,,,,,,,,,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,JUL,2020,29,7,,,,,1177,1188,,10.1111/geb.13094,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13094,,APR 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000522748700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Physiological flexibility can compensate for certain ecological perturbations, but our basic understanding of how species function in a given habitat and the extent of their adaptive scope is limited. Here we studied the effect of acute, experimental microclimate change on the thermal physiology of two populations of the widespread Malagasy bat, Macronycteris commersoni. Populations of this species are found roosting under contrasting conditions, i.e., in a constant hot and humid cave or below foliage unprotected from fluctuations in ambient conditions. We exposed free-ranging individuals of each population to the respective opposite condition and thus to novel microclimate within an ecologically realistic scope while measuring metabolic rate and skin temperature. Cave bats in forest setting had a limited capacity to maintain euthermia to the point that two individuals became hypothermic when ambient temperature dropped below their commonly experienced cave temperature. Forest bats on the other hand, had difficulties to dissipate heat in the humid cave set-up. The response to heat, however, was surprisingly uniform and all bats entered torpor combined with hyperthermia at temperatures exceeding their thermoneutral zone. Thus, while we observed potential for flexible compensation of heat through hot torpor, both populations showed patterns suggestive of limited potential to cope with acute microclimate changes deviating from their typically occupied roosts. Our study emphasizes that intraspecific variation among populations could be misleading when assessing species' adaptive scopes, as variation may arise from genetic adaptation, developmental plasticity or phenotypic flexibility, all of which allow for compensatory responses at differing time scales. Disentangling these mechanisms and identifying the basis of variation is vital to make accurate predictions of species' chances for persisting in ever rapidly changing habitats and climates.",,,,,,"Reher, Stephanie/0000-0002-5049-0576",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,MAR 7,2022,10,,,,,,,,779381,10.3389/fevo.2022.779381,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.779381,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000775705200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Insect phenology is driven by local climate variables, most notably temperature. Increased warming has been linked to advancements in critical phenophases such as the spring flight of reproductive adults in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.A. 2. Local climate is governed by the fluctuations of large-scale climate oscillations. In the northern hemisphere, both the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) control the local autumn and winter severity. Low NAO and AO indices are associated with colder autumns and winters, which can delay spring phenology. 3. In this study, 36 years of data from experimental fruit orchards in Biglerville, Pennsylvania, were used to run partial least-squares regressions in order to determine the climate variables related to the spring phenology of five tortricid pest species. 4. The phenology of the tortricid pests did not advance, even though there was evidence of warming at the research site. 5. Spring temperatures were found to be the most significant climate variables in determining the timing of the spring flights. However, autumn-winter temperatures were also important. 6. For the NAO and the AO, it was found that these oscillations affected the tortricid moths by influencing autumn-winter conditions. The oscillations of the NAO and AO can obscure long-term changes in phenology. 7. These findings suggest that the inclusion of large-scale climate oscillations can provide important insights into how climate conditions can influence insect phenology, and presents an opportunity for improving the ability to forecast spring emergence.",,,,,,"Pak, Damie/0000-0002-8335-110X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,JUN,2019,44,3,,,,,367,379,,10.1111/een.12712,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/een.12712,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000467427900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Amphipods were best represented in the total number of species (32) and individuals (89% of numerical abundance) followed by isopods (12 species and 11% abundance) and tanaids (2 species and 1%). The highest number of species was registered in intermediate levels (1-1.5 m) dominated by Corallina elongata, although the highest abundances of peracarids were associated to seaweeds of lower levels (0-1 m) such as Gelidium corneum, Osmundea pinnatifida, Valonia utricularis and a turf of Caufacanthus ustulatus. The most abundant peracarids, Hyale stebbingi, H. schmidti, H. perieri, Stenothoe monoculoides. Caprella penantis, C. grandimana, Dynamene edwardsii and Ischyromene lacazei, were present throughout the whole year during 2006 and 2007.

Multivariate analyses confirmed a clear zonation of algae and associated peracarids in a vertical gradient, which was maintained stable during the two-year study. Several physical and biological factors may regulate such patterns of peracarid abundance and future experimental studies are necessary to explore the importance of factors such as competition, predation or weather conditions.

In experiment I, six casein gelatin based isonitrogenous (380 g kg(-1) CP) and isocaloric (17.9 MJ kg(-1) GE; 15.3 MJ kg(-1) DE) amino acid test diets with graded levels of methionine (6.5, 8, 9.5, 11, 12.5, and 14 g kg(-1) of the dry diet) were prepared. Cystine was maintained at 4 g kg(-1) in all the diets. The diets were fed to quadruplicate groups of randomly assigned fingerlings (6.9 +/- 0.1 g; 10.9 +/- 0.2 cm) to apparent satiety twice daily at 28 degrees C water temperature in a flow-through system (1-1.5 L min(-1)). Based on the quadratic regression analysis at 95% maximum and minimum response of absolute weight gain (AWG g fish(-1)), feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein deposition efficiency (PDE%), energy deposition efficiency (EDE%), RNA: DNA ratio and methionine retention efficiency (MRE%), methionine requirements were found to range between 10.3 and 10.7 g kg(-1) of dry diet, corresponding to 27.1-28.2 g kg(-1) of the dietary protein. Hence, TSAA requirement was found to be 14.7 g kg(-1) of the dry diet (10.7 g kg(-1) methionine + 4 g kg(-1) cystine). To find out the cystine replacement value for methionine, six diets with various ratios of methionine: cystine (90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, and 40:60) on equimolar sulfur basis as per the TSAA requirement determined in experiment I (14.7 g kg(-1)) were prepared and fed to fingerling H. fossilis (7.2 +/- 0.2 g; 11.3 +/- 0.1 cm) under identical laboratory conditions. The quadratic regression analysis of AWG g fish(-1), FCR, PDE%, EDE%, RNA: DNA ratio and MRE% at 95% maximum and minimum quadratic response projected that cystine could replace from 39.6 to 40.2% of methionine requirement on an equimolar sulfur basis without hampering growth. On the basis of the above results, the total sulfur amino acid requirement of the H. fossilis is recommended to be 14.7 g kg(-1) dry diet (7.1 g kg(-1) methionine + 7.6 g kg(-1) cystine) of which 39.9% was spared by cystine.

Moreover, the mathematical models for coupled heat and moisture transfer without and with moisture phase change were established. Based on the interactions among the moisture phase change, temperature field, and moisture field inside the porous materials, a loop iteration calculation method was proposed to solve for the heat flux caused by moisture migration and phase change. By combining the heat flux with the classical evaporation and condensation theory, the additional thermal conductivities (ATCs) caused by the moisture migration and phase change were obtained. In order to obtain the quantitative relationships between the main factors and ATC caused by moisture transfer, different temperature and humidity boundary conditions were used to analyze the ATC. The results show that the ATC caused by moisture migration increases when the temperature difference decreases and the water vapor pressure difference between the indoor and outdoor air increases. The ATC is greatly influenced by outdoor air temperature fluctuations, while the influence of water vapor pressure fluctuations is relatively small. The value for the ATC caused by moisture phase change is mainly determined by the temperature gradient. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Results showed that the growth and survival of germlings were significantly affected by salinity and duration of osmotic stress, rather than by osmotic frequency. In addition to the main effects, all two-way, three-way and four-way interactions between the four stresses on the growth were significant. Germlings showed quick growth with relative growth rate (RGR, % day(-1)) over 16% when cultured at 32 psu combined with 30 degrees C. Although growths of germlings subjected to hypo-osmotic and hyper-osmotic conditions were significantly inhibited, RGRs over 12% were obtained except for those at 35 degrees C with the RGRs below 10%. In comparison to growth, survival was more tolerant to osmotic stress. Germlings showed high survivals over 60% when exposed to most osmotic stresses, by the end of experiment Only under extreme conditions (12 psu for 4 h or 8 h at 35 degrees C) were the survivals reduced to below 10%. Although the effects of osmotic stress on the growth and survival were significant, germlings exhibited quick growth and high survival under most conditions. And those extreme conditions which had great destructive effect on germlings barely exist in field. Therefore, the construction of artificial tanks is feasible for the restoration of S. thunbergii beds in the intertidal zone. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Plasticity may occur in response to the environment experienced during an individual's lifetime or to the environment experienced by parents (transgenerational plasticity), and may be adaptive if it enhances fitness. In particular, plasticity in thermal traits, such as preferred temperatures and thermal limits, may improve performance and fitness based on temperatures in the local environment. This study examined the influence of parental and offspring thermal environments (duration of access to a basking lamp) on offspring thermal traits (preferred temperatures and panting threshold) in jacky dragons (Agamidae: Amphibolurus muricatus). Long-bask parental environments led, indirectly, to higher preferred temperatures of offspring due to increased offspring body mass compared to offspring of short-bask parents. The increase in median temperature preference was associated with a higher voluntary minimum body temperature and a narrower preference range, suggesting tradeoffs in thermal behavior and a matching of offspring preferences to the parental environment. Parental thermal treatment did not influence offspring panting threshold. Instead, the panting threshold tended to be higher in offspring that were reared in the long-bask treatment compared to those in the short-bask treatment, suggesting longer basking environments increased thermal tolerance. Parental and offspring thermal environment did not exhibit any interactive effect on thermal traits. The results indicate that thermal environments experienced by lizards can have both transgenerational and within-generation impacts on thermal traits, thus influencing how populations respond to fluctuating or changing climates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2471-5646,,,,,JUL-AUG,2018,329,6-7,,,SI,,308,316,,10.1002/jez.2197,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.2197,,,,,,,,29938929,,,,,WOS:000446522200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since local environmental conditions vary along latitudinal clines, latitude has become an essential component in projecting plant response to warming. Three ecotypes of Arabidopsis were selected from varying latitudes in order to investigate heat stress within an ecotype and project potential effects across a gradient. Control and heat stressed groups received 12 hour photoperiods. Control plants were grown at 2.7/22.7 degrees C day/night mean temperatures and heat stressed plants were grown at 22.7/29 degrees C day/night mean temperatures. Plants were quantified and harvested 35 days after sowing. The number of rosette leaves, flower buds, and fruits resulted in significant differences both between control and heat stressed plants of the same ecotype and also across ecotypes. Heat overwhelmingly resulted in a quantitative decrease across all parameters, including overall plant size, with the exception of flowers in ecotype 902. And even though the heat stressed 902 plants flowered while the control group plants did not, neither produced fruit.

Implications for vulnerability to climate warming,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Current climate change is generating accelerated increase in extreme heat events and organismal plastic adjustments in upper thermal tolerances, (critical thermal maximum -CTmax) are recognized as the quicker mitigating mechanisms. However, current research casts doubt on the actual mitigating role of thermal acclimation to face heat impacts, due to its low magnitude and weak environmental signal. Here, we examined these drawbacks by first estimating maximum extent of thermal acclimation by examining known sources of variation affecting CTmax expression, such as daily thermal fluctuation and heating rates. Second, we examined whether the magnitude and pattern of CTmax plasticity is dependent of the thermal environment by comparing the acclimation responses of six species of tropical amphibian tadpoles inhabiting thermally contrasting open and shade habitats and, finally, estimating their warming tolerances (WT = CTmax - maximum temperatures) as estimator of heating risk. We found that plastic CTmax responses are improved in tadpoles exposed to fluctuating daily regimens. Slow heating rates implying longer duration assays determined a contrasting pattern in CTmax plastic expression, depending on species environment. Shade habitat species suffer a decline in CTmax whereas open habitat tadpoles greatly increase it, suggesting an adaptive differential ability of hot exposed species to quick hardening adjustments. Open habitat tadpoles although overall acclimate more than shade habitat species, cannot capitalize this beneficial increase in CTmax, because the maximum ambient temperatures are very close to their critical limits, and this increase may not be large enough to reduce acute heat stress under the ongoing global warming.",,,,,,"HOYOS, JULIO MARIO/0000-0003-1232-9324",,,,,,,,,,,,,2471-5638,2471-5646,,,,AUG,2022,337,7,,,,,746,759,,10.1002/jez.2632,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.2632,,JUN 2022,,,,,,35674344,,,,,WOS:000807470100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyzed the picoplanktonic community patterns and their related environmental factors in a hypertrophic semi-arid wetland located in Central Spain (Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park, TDNP). We determined the bacterial and autotrophic picoplankton (APP) abundance over a three-year period (1996: the end of a long drought period and 1997-1998: after flooding) in five sites of the wetland. The overall range of bacterial abundance was 0.2 x 10(6) to 10 x 10(6) cells/ml. The annual mean abundance increased in the wettest 1997. APP was composed mainly by coccoid phycocyanin-containing cyanobacteria, with the greatest abundance up to 25 X 101 cells/ml. The annual mean also increased considerably in wetter 1997-98. Despite the large APP biomass in some sites, its percentage of total phytoplankton biomass was low (the annual average did not exceed 1.5%). We observed spatial heterogeneity in the picoplankton fraction depending on the fluctuating hydrology: bacteria tends to spatial homogeneity after flooding while APP showed only similarity among the output sites. Among the considered predictive variables (temperature, phosphorus, nitrogen, zooplankton, phytoplankton) of the picoplanktonic dynamics, temperature was the most closely correlated to picoplankton, especially to bacterial abundance. Further, in two factorial, coupled-hierarchical laboratory experiments (constant temperature), we searched for control mechanisms of picoplankton. We tested (a) the trophic cascade hypothesis by analyzing the effect of presence/absence of mosquitofish (experiment 1) or directly modifying the zooplanktonic community (experiment 2) and (b) the bottom-up regulation by altering the nutrient conditions (presence/absence of sediment in experiment 1; reducing the nutrient content in experiment 2).

The aim of this study was to evaluate how sudden or gradual changes in environmental temperature together with the administration of Piscirickettsia salmonis modulate the transcription of genes involved in cellular stress response in the liver of Eleginops maclovinus. Fish were subjected to the following experimental conditions in duplicate: C- 12 degrees C: Injection only with culture medium, C+ 12 degrees C: Injection with P. salmonis, AM 18 degrees C: Injection only with culture medium under acclimation at 18 degrees C, AB 18 degrees C: Injection with P. salmonis under acclimation at 18 degrees C, SM 18 degrees C: Injection only with culture medium and thermal shock at 18 degrees C and SB 18 degrees C: Injection with P. salmonis and thermal shock at 18 degrees C and sampling at 4-, 8-, 12-, 16- and 20-day post injection (dpi). The genes implied in the heat shock response (HSP70, HSC70, HSP90, and GRP78), apoptosis pathway (BAX and SMAC/Diablo), ubiquitination (E2, E3, ubiquitin, and CHIP), and 26 proteasome complex (PSMB7, PSMC1, and PSMA2) showed expression profiles dependent on time and type of injection applied. All the genes greatly increased their expression levels at day 16 and showed moderate increases at day 20, except for PSMA2 which showed a higher increase between 4- and 12-day post challenges.

J,"Le Roy, A; Seebacher, F",,,,"Le Roy, Amelie; Seebacher, Frank",,,Transgenerational effects and acclimation affect dispersal in guppies,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Evolutionary theory predicts that intergenerational environmental fluctuations lead to transgenerational effects where offspring phenotypes are matched to conditions experienced by previous generations. However, in fluctuating environments, transgenerational effects can be detrimental by causing mismatches between ancestral and offspring environments. Acclimation in offspring could alleviate these negative effects. 2. We determined whether the interaction between transgenerational effects and acclimation affects locomotor performance and dispersal in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). In a fully factorial experiment, we tested the interaction between ancestral (22 or 30 degrees C for six to eight generations), acclimation (22 or 30 degrees C for 4weeks) and acute test temperatures (two to five temperatures across 18-34 degrees C). We predicted that matching ancestral and acclimation temperatures to acute environmental temperature maximises physiological capacities (swimming performance [U-crit] and metabolic enzyme activities), and dispersal in an artificial stream. Alternatively, when ancestral and acute temperatures were mismatched, we predicted that thermal acclimation compensates for this mismatch by shifting performance curves. Finally, we hypothesised that physiological capacities are positively related to dispersal. We measured dispersal as a combination of traits characterising the departure and transient phases of dispersal (time taken to leave the introductory pool, voluntary speed against the current, number of dispersal decisions taken) in an 8-m artificial stream. 3. As hypothesised, U-crit was greatest when ancestral, acclimation and acute temperatures matched. Cold acclimation reduced the decrement in U-crit resulting from a mismatch between ancestral and acute test temperatures. In both sexes, the interaction between ancestral and acclimation temperatures determined U-crit, but not metabolic enzyme activities, and it affected the number of dispersal decisions in males only. Contrary to our hypothesis, physiological capacities did not constrain dispersal. Males were more likely to initiate dispersal when the acute temperatures mismatched their ancestral temperature. After initiating dispersal, males moved at a greater voluntary speed and made more dispersal decisions in environments matching their ancestral environment. 4. Our findings imply that although the interaction between transgenerational effects and acclimation modulates locomotor capacities, these relationships do not necessarily translate to all ecologically relevant locomotor tasks. Instead, sex-specific life-history traits such as life span are more likely to influence dispersal, and males in particular may initiate dispersal to escape suboptimal conditions.",,,,,,"Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,JUL,2018,32,7,,,,,1819,1831,,10.1111/1365-2435.13105,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13105,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000437281100015,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Australia, both the depth and duration of snow cover have declined significantly in recent decades and this trend is projected to continue with global warming. Many small arthropods remain active throughout the winter, within a space beneath the snowpack (subnivean) where the snow's insulation creates a thermally stable environment. Using field surveys and experimental manipulation of snow depth at two locations in the Australian alpine region, we explored the diversity of winter-active arthropods and their response to reduced snow. Individuals from 18 arthropod Orders were detected beneath the snow during winter, with Collembola, Araneae, Acari and Coleoptera accounting for 95-98% of the individuals collected. The subnivean taxa represented a distinct subset of those active outside the winter months. Removal of the snow layer increased daily temperature fluctuations, increased the number of days below freezing and raised the mean surface temperatures. Community composition was altered by snow removal, driven by changes in the numbers of two abundant springtail taxa at each location. We found a strong reduction in the abundances of both taxa at one study site, and contrasting responses (one strong positive and one strong negative) to snow removal at the second study site. Subnivean arthropod communities in Australia thus appear sensitive to snow conditions at small spatial scales.",,,,,"Nash, Michael/AAA-1148-2021; Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019","Nash, Michael/0000-0003-4470-2832; Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645",,,,,,,,,,,,,1442-9985,1442-9993,,,,NOV,2017,42,7,,,,,844,857,,10.1111/aec.12507,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.12507,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000413405000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Chronic hypoxia during the summer has become a common occurrence in numerous estuaries, degrading nursery habitat and increasing the potential for exposure of juvenile fish to low levels of dissolved oxygen (DO). We conducted a laboratory study to investigate how hypoxic conditions and temperature affect growth rates of two juvenile estuary-dependent fish: the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) and spot (Leiostomus xanthurus). For a 2-week period, we exposed the fish to one of four constant DO levels (6.0, 4.0, 2.0 or 1.5 mg O-2 1(-1)), at one of two temperatures (25 or 30 degreesC). A fifth DO treatment, included for spot at 30 degreesC, allowed DO to fluctuate from 10.0 mg O-2 1(-1) during the day, to 2.0 mg O-2 1(-1) at night. This diel fluctuation approximated the natural DO cycle in tidal estuarine creeks. Size measurements were recorded at the beginning, middle and end of experiments. Growth rates were generally unaffected by low DO until concentrations dropped to 1.5 Mg O-2 1(-1), resulting in 31-89% growth reductions. Our results suggest that DO levels must be severely depressed, and in fact, approaching lethal limits, to negatively impact growth of juvenile spot and Atlantic menhaden.

While field observations on extremes are emerging, experimental evidence of their biological consequences is rare. Here, we introduce a mesocosm system that was developed to study the effects of environmental variability of multiple drivers (temperature, salinity, pH, light) on single species and communities at various temporal scales (diurnal - seasonal): the Kiel Indoor Benthocosms (KIBs). Both, real-time offsets from field measurements or various dynamic regimes of environmental scenarios, can be implemented, including sinusoidal curve functions at any chosen amplitude or frequency, stochastic regimes matching in situ dynamics of previous years and modeled extreme events. With temperature as the driver in focus, we highlight the strengths and discuss limitations of the system. In addition, we examined the effects of different sinusoidal temperature fluctuation frequencies on mytilid mussel performance. High-frequency fluctuations around a warming mean (+2 degrees C warming, +/- 2 degrees C fluctuations, wavelength = 1.5 d) increased mussel growth as did a constant warming of 2 degrees C. Fluctuations at a lower frequency (+2 and +/- 2 degrees C, wavelength = 4.5 d), however, reduced the mussels' growth. This shows that environmental fluctuations, and importantly their associated characteristics (such as frequency), can mediate the strength of global change impacts on a key marine species. The here presented mesocosm system can help to overcome a major short-coming of marine experimental ecology and will provide more robust data for the prediction of shifts in ecosystem structure and services in a changing and fluctuating world.",,,,,"Hiebenthal, Claas/AAF-9564-2021; Pansch, Christian/I-9170-2012","Hiebenthal, Claas/0000-0003-4774-3242; Pansch, Christian/0000-0001-8442-4502",,,,,,,,,,,,,1541-5856,,,,,FEB,2019,17,2,,,,,145,162,,10.1002/lom3.10306,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10306,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000459497000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

To determine the potential impact of acidification and warming on a conspicuous component of the temperate intertidal fauna of the southern hemisphere, the response of newly metamorphosed juvenile (ca. 450 mu m diameter) sea stars (Parvulastra exigua) to increased acidification and temperature was investigated with respect to conditions recorded in the habitat (-0.4-0.6 pH units, + 2-4 degrees C), in all combinations of stressors. In situ monitoring was used to generate data on environmental conditions. The pH(NIST) of the tide pools varied from 7.54 (pCO(2) 2045 mu atm) at predawn to 8.91 (pCO(2) 28 mu atm) in the afternoon and temperature varied from 10 degrees C at night to 24 degrees C during the day, conditions that fluctuated from baseline sea surface conditions of pH 8.2 and 16 degrees C. P. exigua was used as a model tolerant intertidal species to generate insights into stress tolerance of the early benthic life stage. After a 4-week incubation in experimental conditions, negative effects on juvenile development and growth were only observed at pHNIsT 7.2 (-1.0 units/pCO(2) 4430-4601 mu atm; (Omega cal 0.6, Omega ar 0.4). Our results indicate that juvenile P. exigua is physiologically acclimatised to tolerate extreme conditions indicating that it may be robust to near future (ca. 2100) change in ocean conditions. Although it is difficult to know how tide pools will change in the future, pulses of the deleterious level of acidification (pH(NIsT) 7.2) may occur in the intertidal in future night time low tides.

Cold-triggered reduction in maximum quantum yield of PSII (F-v/F-m) was connected especially with drastic decreasing F-v and F-m. Interestingly, high quantitative amounts of soluble proteins along with induction of the new probable polypeptide induced at cold temperature, were attributed to low deduction of maximwn quantum yield of PSII. Additionally, more imperative chlorophyll fluorescence parameters changed e.g. qP, NPQ, qL, Y(II) or Phi(PSII) etc at light. Nowadays, radar charts or spider plots arc the most sophisticated multivariate statistical tools representing physiological responses of plants to abiotic stress conditions or even morphophysiological studies of plants. In rapeseed many researches performed by applying the radar charts for low temperature stresses and interpreted their effects more advancely than common statistical tools. We observed a good representation of the chl fluorescence parameters fluctuations using radar plots.

In turtles, eggs are deposited in layers within the nest, such that thermal gradients create independent developmental conditions for each egg. Despite differences in developmental rate, several studies have revealed unexpected synchronicity in hatching, however, the mechanisms through which synchrony are achieved may be different between species. Here, we examine the phenomenon of synchronous hatching in turtles by assessing proximate mechanisms in an Australian freshwater turtle (Emydura macquarii). We tested whether embryos hatch prematurely or developmentally compensate in response to more advanced embryos in a clutch. We established developmental asynchrony within a clutch of turtle eggs and assessed both metabolic and heart rates throughout incubation in constant and fluctuating temperatures. Turtles appeared to hatch at similar developmental stages, with less-developed embryos in experimental groups responding to the presence of more developed eggs in a clutch by increasing both metabolic and heart rates. Early hatching did not appear to reduce neuromuscular ability at hatching. These results support developmental adjustment mechanisms of the 'catch-up hypothesis' for synchronous hatching in E. macquarii and implies some level of embryo-embryo communication. The group environment of a nest strongly supports the development of adaptive communication mechanisms between siblings and the evolution of environmentally cued hatching.",,,,,"Old, Julie/AAE-7355-2021","Old, Julie/0000-0002-2754-7757; Spencer, Ricky/0000-0001-8112-4221",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,MAY 7,2012,279,1734,,,,,1709,1715,,10.1098/rspb.2011.2074,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.2074,,,,,,,,22130606,,,,,WOS:000301981300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

To consider simultaneously SIA's effect on structure and thermal fluctuations, we use molecular dynamics and simulate the dimeric form of the Newcastle disease virus HN. We find that SIA induces only minor structural changes in individual monomers, yet it reorients dimer interface by 10 degrees. Interface reorientation is accompanied by constriction of SIA binding groove and enhanced fluctuations of interfacial residues that disrupt hydrophobic interactions and favor creation of new salt bridges. Supervised machine learning analysis of non-equilibrium data reveals that the allosteric signal is not formed from a directed sequence of these events.

Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting temperature and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and heat constraints in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G x E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G x D, G x H, and G x H x D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to heat and drought constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G x E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises.

In this work, daily multiple source climatic data which were collected between 1980 and 2017, from 18 weather stations and five atmospheric circulation indices were used for this purpose. The key findings were as follows; by employing principal component analysis (PCA), six temporal variability modes were identified as six corresponding sub-regions with various Aman rice CIYI fluctuations. The Aman rice CIYI in different sub-regions represented a noteworthy 3-4-year quasi-oscillation using the EEMD. The key climate variables (KCVs) including the potential evapotranspiration and cloud cover in September, the minimum temperature in August, and precipitation in July, August, and October were the best rice yield prediction signals in these sub-regions. The results suggest that Aman rice yield could likely decline by 33.59%, and 3.37% in the southwestern and southeastern regions, respectively, if KCV increased by 1 degrees C or 1%. The RF model suggests that the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) significantly influenced the rice yield. Isotopic signatures were employed to confirm the fluctuation and anti-amount effect during the Aman rice-growing period in Bangladesh.

This experiment provided a unique opportunity to study the succession of different N-2-fixing microorganisms (diazotrophs) and calculate in situ net growth and mortality rates in response to fertilization with dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) over a 23-day period, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays targeting widely distributed marine diazotroph lineages. Inside the mesocosms, the most abundant diazotroph was the heterocyst-forming Richelia associated with Rhizosolenia (Het-1) in the first half of the experiment, while unicellular cyanobacterial Group C (UCYN-C) became abundant during the second half of the experiment. Decreasing DIP concentrations following the fertilization event and increasing temperatures were significantly correlated with increasing abundances of UCYN-C. Maximum net growth rates for UCYN-C were calculated to range between 1.23 +/- 0.07 and 2.16 +/- 0.07 d(-1) in the mesocosms, which are among the highest growth rates reported for diazotrophs. Outside the mesocosms in the New Caledonia lagoon, UCYN-C abundances remained low, despite increasing temperatures, suggesting that the microbial community response to the DIP fertilization created conditions favorable for UCYN-C growth inside the mesocosms. Diazotroph community composition analysis using PCR targeting a component of the nitrogenase gene (nifH) verified that diazotrophs targeted in qPCR assays were collectively among the major lineages in the lagoon and mesocosm samples, with the exception of Crocosphaera-like phylotypes, where sequence types not typically seen in the oligotrophic ocean grew in the mesocosms. Maximum net growth and mortality rates for nine diazotroph phylotypes throughout the 23-day experiment were variable between mesocosms, and repeated fluctuations between periods of net growth and mortality were commonly observed. The field population of diazotrophs in the New Caledonian lagoon waters appeared to be dominated by Het-1 over the course of the study period.

The tongue sole exhibited better growth in treatments with moderate amplitude and frequency of salinity fluctuation (amplitude +/- 4-6; frequency 4-8 d) than in other treatments and the control. In terms of energy budget, salinity fluctuation strongly affected the proportions of energy components, including those deposited for growth and lost in respiration, feces, and excretion.

Most studies have focused on shallow e.g., < 30 cm depth) soil CO2 dynamics neglecting processes in deeper soil layers where highly CO2-enriched air can be stored or transported through soil pores and fissures. Here, we examine the relationship among variations in subterranean CO2 molar fraction, volumetric water content, soil temperature and atmospheric pressure during three years within soil profiles 0.15, 0.50, and 1.50 m depths) in two semi-arid grasslands located in southeastern Spain. We applied a wavelet coherence analysis to study the temporal variability and temporal correlation between the CO2 molar fraction and its covariates soil temperature, soil moisture and atmospheric pressure). Our results show that CO2 dynamics are strongly influenced by changes in atmospheric pressure from semidiurnal, diurnal and synoptic to monthly time-scales for all soil depths. In contrast, only weak daily dependencies were found at the surface level 0.15 m) regarding soil temperature and volumetric water content. Atmospheric pressure changes substantially influence variations in the CO2 content with daily fluctuations of up to 2000 ppm) denoting transportation through soil layers. These results provide insights into the importance of subterranean storage and non-diffusive gas transport that could influence soil CO2 efflux rates, processes that are not considered when applying the flux-gradient approach and, which can be especially important in ecosystems with high air permeability between the unsaturated porous media and the atmosphere. Plain Language Summary Each type of ecosystem has a role in the balance of atmospheric greenhouse gases, acting as either sink or source. Semi-arid ecosystems occupy approximately 40% of the terrestrial surface and dominate the trend and variability of the land CO2 sink. The roles played by such ecosystems remain under-investigated, and the resulting lack of knowledge undermines future predictions of global environmental change. This study shows that underground CO2 dynamics in two semi-arid ecosystems are strongly influenced by changes in atmospheric pressure with strong daily fluctuations), while only weak dependencies were found regarding soil temperature and water content factors that affect biologic activity). The atmospheric pressure effect on the soil CO2 concentration was more evident when the air permeability between atmosphere and soil surface was higher. Soil CO2 variations forced by changes in atmospheric pressure occur consistently from semidiurnal to monthly time-scales. These observations will help to improve the current models that assume soil temperature and moisture to be the main drivers of soil CO2 dynamics, but are mistakenly applied in semi-arid ecosystems.",,,,,"López-Ballesteros, Ana/AAA-3119-2021; Vargas, Rodrigo/C-4720-2008; Kowalski, Andrew S./A-7515-2008; Sánchez-Cañete, E.

Over the entire experiment, increase in dietary NE concentration was associated with a decreased ADFI (3.216, 3.216, 3.122, 2.910, 2.732, and 2.684 kg/d, respectively, for diets containing 8.1 to 11.1 MJ NE/kg; linear, P < 0.01). The NE intake increased as dietary NE increased from 8.1 to 11.1 MJ NE/kg (26.04, 27.98, 29.03, 28.81, 28.68, and 29.77 MJ/d, respectively; linear, P < 0.01, and quadratic, P = 0.06). Average daily gain increased when dietary NE concentration increased (1.046, 1.126, 1.135, 1.177, 1.156, and 1.152 kg/d, respectively, for diets containing 8.1 to 11.1 MJ NE/kg; linear and quadratic, P < 0.01). The increase in dietary NE concentration was associated with an increase in dressing percentage (76.5, 77.0, 77.4, 78.0, 78.2, and 78.4% of BW; linear, P < 0.01) but no differences in lean percentage (58.3, 57.9, 58.0, 57.3, 58.1, and 56.4% of HCW, respectively, for diets containing 8.1 to 11.1 MJ NE/kg; P = 0.12). When dietary NE concentration increased from 8.1 to 11.1 MJ/kg, the G:F increased (0.326, 0.352, 0.364, 0.405, 0.425, and 0.428 kg/kg, respectively; linear, P < 0.01), but the G:F expressed using the NE system did not change (G:F, 39.97 g/MJ NE; P = 0.44). When adjusted to the same dressing yield and lean percentage, the differences in adjusted ADG increased among treatments, but the adjusted G:F expressed using the NE system was not influenced by dietary energy concentration. These results confirm the ability of individually housed pigs to adjust their spontaneous feed intake over a very wide range of NE concentrations (8.7 to 10.5 MJ/kg). Under commercial conditions, pigs may experience less variation in ADFI than the results obtained in this experiment because of differences in dietary energy concentrations. However, it seems that only a severe reduction in dietary energy concentration will be effective in restricting energy intake of pigs that are allowed ad libitum access to feed.",,,,,,"QUINIOU, Nathalie/0000-0002-2970-8235",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8812,1525-3163,,,,DEC,2012,90,12,,,,,4362,4372,,10.2527/jas.2011-4004,http://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2011-4004,,,,,,,,22696619,,,,,WOS:000312738400023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our study examined the use of beaver ponds by the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) in a network of boreal streams in west-central Alberta, Canada. We quantified relations between breeding populations of wood frogs estimated from call surveys and pond age and riparian canopy cover, and we compared an index of juvenile recruitment to metamorphosis estimated with pitfall trap captures between new (< 10 yr) and old (> 25 yr) beaver ponds. We also conducted an in-pond enclosure experiment to determine if differences in physicochemical conditions of new versus old ponds influenced larval performance. Regression and Akaike's Information Criterion model averaging indicated that both density and calling intensity of male wood frogs at beaver ponds had a negative relationship with percent riparian canopy cover and had a positive relationship with pond age. The best a priori statistical models, however, included riparian canopy cover rather than pond age as a significant covariate. Old ponds had reduced riparian canopy and greater abundance of submergent vegetation, thermal degree-days, and dissolved oxygen concentrations compared to newly formed ponds. While survival of larval wood frogs in enclosures did not differ between pond age classes, growth and development rates in old ponds were greater than in new ponds. In addition to warmer water in old ponds, results from a laboratory experiment suggest that higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen characteristic of old ponds can enhance larval growth rates. Older beaver ponds may support more breeding wood frogs due to adult selection for open-canopy ponds and the associated larval environments favourable for high rates of juvenile recruitment. Forest management that protects beaver and their food supplies may also promote healthy populations of boreal amphibians.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-541X,1937-2817,,,,NOV,2006,70,5,,,,,1360,1371,,10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[1360:OIBBPO]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[1360:OIBBPO]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000242932700023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Growth rates were higher at a site with consistently higher quality food than at the other site where less high-quality food was produced and which was less predictably accessible. Survivorship was higher at the second site where temperature fluctuations were consistently smaller. Individuals from the two populations were kept for 6 months under the same food and temperature conditions and patterns of resource allocation to reproductive traits analysed. Members of the population from the site with good growth conditions had significantly higher reproductive allocation, by 13.5%, and larger broods, by 9.1%, than those from the site with poor growth conditions. Contrary to theoretical predictions, they also had significantly larger offspring, by 7.5% dry mass. Larger offspring survived better than small ones. This differential survivorship, by 20% for a 3.4% difference in live mass, was much more pronounced under conditions of moisture stress and under fluctuating temperature regimes. Larger offspring would therefore be at a selective advantage on the site with more severe temperature fluctuations. Phenotypic plasticity in reproductive traits in response to experimental changes in food quality, temperature and crowding were monitored. Reproductive allocation was increased by 20.8% under conditions of higher food quality, by 14.7% at higher temperatures, and by 12.5% under less crowded conditions. Brood size, but not offspring dry mass, increased when food quality increased. When crowding increased by 25.0%, the size of broods remained the same but the dry mass of individual offspring decreased by 11.2%. Members of the population from the site with more variable access to high-quality food showed more plasticity in reproductive traits in response to changes in food supply than members of the population from the site with the more predictable food supply. Members of the population from the site with more stable temperatures showed less plasticity to temperature changes than members of the population from the site with greater temperature fluctuations.

The deep-bedded method employed was hoop structures, which are large, tent-like shelters with cornstalks or straw for bedding. One hundred gilts ranging in weight from 59 to 71 kg were randomly assigned to treatments of low (0.70 m(2) per pig, n = 50) or high (1.13 m(2) per pig, n = 50) space allocation. During the 45-day experimental period, gilts were ad libitum fed a two-phase diet. Six gilts per treatment were used for carcass composition and pork quality evaluation for each replication. Five replications were conducted over a period of 4 months. Pigs finished with greater space allocation had smaller longissimus muscle area and produced pork that appeared to be darker Variations in fatty acid composition and lipid percentage of subcutaneous adipose and longissimus dorsi muscle were observed when space allocation was changed within hoop structures. Less space resulted in greater proportion of lipid present as polyunsaturated fatty acids. Greater space allocation resulted in lower total lipid in subcutaneous pork adipose tissue. Space allocation did not affect fat firmness. Replications spanned the months of August to November, with temperatures ranging from 32 degrees C to -2 degrees C within the hoop structure, As environmental temperature declined, the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids increased. Providing more space during finishing in these systems had only a small affect on pig growth and pork quality. Variations observed from replication to replication at fluctuating temperatures provide insight to seasonal differences in growth and adipose tissue composition and firmness. Therefore, finishing pigs in these systems may lead to seasonal variation in livid composition.",,,,,"Lonergan, Steven M/O-6233-2016; Huff-Lonergan, Elisabeth/C-7557-2009","Huff-Lonergan, Elisabeth/0000-0001-5012-3277",,,,,,,,,,,,,1751-7311,,,,,MAR,2008,2,3,,,,,471,478,,10.1017/S1751731107001280,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1751731107001280,,,,,,,,22445050,,,,,WOS:000253609900018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Populations in the fluctuating environment were maintained either with an adult 0degreesC cold shock or without a shock. These conditions were expected to result in temperature-specific directional selection for increased viability and productivity under both temperature regimes, and reduced development time under the fluctuating-temperature regime. Selection responses of all lines were tested under both temperature regimes after controlling for carry-over effects by rearing lines in these environments for two generations. When tested in the 19degreesC environment, lines evolving at 19degreesC showed a faster development time and a lower productivity relative to the other lines, while cold shock reduced development time and productivity of all lines. When tested in the fluctuating environment, productivity of the 7-18degreesC lines selected with a cold shock was relatively lower than that of lines selected without a shock, but this pattern was not observed in the other populations. Viability and body size as measured by wing length were not altered by selection or cold shock, although there were consistent effects of source population on wing length. These results provide little evidence for temperature-specific adaptation in D. serrata-although the lines had diverged for some traits, these changes were not consistent with a priori predictions. In particular, there was no evidence for life-history changes reflecting adaptation to winter conditions at the southern border.

J,"Bunce, JA",,,,"Bunce, JA",,,Contrasting effects of carbon dioxide and irradiance on the acclimation of photosynthesis in developing soybean leaves,PHOTOSYNTHETICA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leaves developed at high irradiance (I) often have higher photosynthetic capacity than those developed at low I, while leaves developed at elevated CO2 concentration [CO2] often have reduced photosynthetic capacity compared with leaves developed at lower [CO2]. Because both high I and elevated [CO2] stimulate photosynthesis of developing leaves, their contrasting effects on photosynthetic capacity at maturity suggest that the extra photosynthate may be utilized differently depending on whether I or [CO2] stimulates photosynthesis. These experiments were designed to test whether relationships between photosynthetic income and the net accumulation of soluble protein in developing leaves, or relationships between soluble protein and photosynthetic capacity at full expansion differed depending on whether I or [CO2] was varied during leaf development. Soybean plants were grown initially with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 950 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 350 mu mol[CO2] mol(-1), then exposed to [CO2] ranging from 135 to 1400 mu mol mol(-1) for the last 3 d of expansion of third trifoliolate leaves. These results were compared with experiments in which I was varied at a constant [CO2] of 350 mu mol mol(-1) over the same developmental period. Increases in area and dry mass over the 3 d were determined along with daily photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic CO2 exchange characteristics and soluble protein content of leaves were determined at the end of the treatment periods. The increase in leaflet mass was about 28% of the dry mass income from photosynthesis minus respiration, regardless of whether [CO2] or I was varied, except that very low I or [CO2] increased this percentage. Leaflet soluble protein per unit of area at full expansion had the same positive linear relationship to photosynthetic income whether [CO2] or I was varied. For variation in I, photosynthetic capacity varied directly with soluble protein per unit area. This was not the case for variation in [CO2]. Increasing [CO2] reduced photosynthetic capacity per unit of soluble protein by up to a factor of 2.5, and photosynthetic capacity exhibited an optimum with respect to growth [CO2]. Thus CO2 did not alter the relationship between photosynthetic income and the utilization of photosynthate in the net accumulation of soluble protein, but did alter the relationship between soluble protein content and photosynthetic characteristics in this species.",,,,,,"Bunce, James/0000-0002-6825-7510",,,,,,,,,,,,,0300-3604,,,,,,2000,38,1,,,,,83,89,,10.1023/A:1026748008530,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026748008530,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000088968300011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its supercooling ability was studied in two populations of H. pomatia. One population originated from Southern Sweden (Gotaland) and the other from Central France (Auvergne). In the experimental design, they were acclimated, over 2 weeks, to artificial winter conditions (hibernation, T = 5degreesC). The Swedish snails showed a rather limited supercooling ability (temperature of crystallization, T-c = -6.4 +/- 0.8 degreesC), significantly greater, however, than the supercooling capacity of the population from France (T-c = -4.6 +/- 1.4 degreesC). In artificial spring conditions (3 months of hibernation followed by a progressive acclimation, over 2 weeks, to activity at T = 20 degreesC), both populations exhibited a similar high T-c (-2.0 +/- 1.0 degreesC). The lower T-c of hibernating Swedish snails could be due to a greater loss of body water, accompanied by a higher concentration of solutes in the hemolymph. In both populations, the variation in hemolymph osmolality measured between hibernating (250-270 mOsm kg(-1)) and active (165-215 mOsm kg(-1)) snails may be explained by the variation in body water mass and did not suggest the production of colligative cryoprotectants. Moreover, the three bacterial strains, Buttiauxella sp., Kluyvera sp., and Tatumella sp. (Enterobacteriaceae) which were isolated from fed snails, but absent in starved snails, did not show any ice-nucleating activity at temperatures higher than -9 degreesC. Only the strain Kluyvera sp. initiated nucleation at -9 degreesC. This strain, therefore, is a weak, also termed a Type III or Class C ice-nucleating active bacterium, but with no influence on the supercooling ability of individual snails. In summary, fluctuations in body water mass of hibernating snail populations, triggering changes in osmolyte concentration, rather than the presence of endogenous ice-nucleating-active bacteria, accounts for fluctuations in their T-c.

Phenotypic plasticity was initially thought to be beneficial to an organism's physiological fitness but several alternative hypotheses have been proposed with growing empirical support. In this study, we tested the full suite of hypotheses by investigating acclimation responses of locomotor performance for nine populations of five species of sub-Antarctic weevils, using static and fluctuating temperatures. Species showed typical locomotion thermal performance curves with temperature of the maximum speed (T-opt) ranging between 22.3 +/- 1.7 degrees C (mean +/- s.e.m.) and 31.1 +/- 0.7 degrees C. For most species, T-opt was not affected by acclimation. For maximum speed (U-max), significant, positive effects of acclimation were found for all species except a supralittoral one. Individuals acclimated to 0 degrees C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation treatments (15 degrees C and fluctuating 0-15 degrees C). Performance breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, T-br) typically showed little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral species was affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and fluctuating temperature treatments were similar. Our findings also revealed that the mean estimated activation energy 0.40 +/- 0.015 eV (mean +/- s.e.m.) was lower than for other herbivores, the category to which these weevils belong, suggesting that some form of compensation in the rate-temperature relationship may be evident.

The first-order fluctuations of oxygen isotope ratios of the outer shell layer along the maximum growth axis recorded the mussels' annual growth from 2002 to 2007. Clear annual Sr/Ca cycles suggest that Sr was incorporated into the shells at a high rate during warm seasons. All three examined shells showed a clear decrease in annual average Sr/Ca with age. Inter- and intra-annual trends suggest that Sr incorporation was higher during periods of faster growth. The Ba concentration and the Ba/Ca ratio of ambient water showed neither an annual periodicity nor a seasonal trend. In contrast to the findings of an inorganic aragonite precipitation experiment, Ba/Ca was positively correlated with ambient temperature. In addition, Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios were positively correlated with each other. These results suggest that not thermodynamic equilibrium partitioning but the shell growth rate controls Ba incorporation into Hyriopsis shells. The Mg/Ca profiles of the three shells suggest that complex factors control the incorporation of Mg into shell aragonite. Water temperature and annual growth rates did not significantly influence Mg incorporation, and substantial interspecimen differences suggested that physicochemical factors do not exert any systematic control on Mg/Ca ratios in Hyriopsis. Instead, the Mg content of shell aragonite might reflect biological contamination with organic material or adsorption phenomena during crystal precipitation rather than regulated substitution into the aragonite crystal lattice.

For example, adult performance, in terms of the location or timing of reproduction in response to environmental signals, can set conditions that affect the performance of developmental stages. In marine invertebrates, however, early performance has been studied primarily in the laboratory. I outline an integrative approach to the study of field reproductive performance in a marine gastropod that undergoes development in intertidal habitats. Embryos within gelatinous masses experience high variability in development temperature and frequent exposure to thermal stress. In laboratory experiments, developmental performance was measured as a function of maximum temperature (T-max) experienced during fluctuations that mimicked field tidal profiles. Performance curves showed declines that coincided with temperature thresholds for heat shock protein (Hsp) expression, a signal of cellular stress. Application of laboratory results to field records of T-max predicted large variation in the survival of embryos deposited on different days. Timing of field reproduction was non-random with respect to T-max, suggesting that adults could help to buffer embryos from environmental stress. Embryo survival, however, was not predicted to benefit from the non-random pattern of adult reproduction. Adults may be constrained to respond to information that only weakly predicts conditions that embryos will experience. Studies that incorporate linkages between life cycle stages in the field may better reveal how performance capacities and constraints at one stage can influence performance and selection at others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,,,,,JUN,2003,43,3,,,,,450,458,,10.1093/icb/43.3.450,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/43.3.450,,,,,,,,21680453,,,,,WOS:000188258400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The C-terminal of most proteins is often flexible and disordered. However, some protein functions are directly related to flexibility and play significant role in enzyme reaction. The critical point for mutation of L2 lipase structure was predicted at the position 385 of the L2 sequence, and the best three mutants were determined based on I-Mutant2.0 software. The best three mutants were S385E, S385I and S385V. The effects of the substitution of the amino acids at the critical point were analysed with molecular dynamics simulation by using Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application software. The predicted mutant L2 lipases were found to have lower root mean square deviation value as compared to L2 lipase. It was indicated that all the three mutants had higher compactness in the structure, consequently enhanced the stability. Root mean square fluctuation analysis showed that the flexibility of L2 lipase was reduced by mutations. Purified S385E lipase had an optimum temperature of 80 degrees C in Tris-HCl pH 8. The highest enzymatic activity of purified S385E lipase was obtained at 80 degrees C temperature in Tris-HCl pH 8, while for L2 lipase it was at 70 degrees C in Glycine-NaOH pH 9. The thermal stability of S385V lipase was enhanced as compared to other protein since that the melting point (T (m)) value was at 85.96 degrees C.

Since the late nineteenth century, many studies have been carried out on the best way to control hygrothermal conditions. In old buildings located in maritime temperate climate zones (such as Portugal) with strong thermal inertia, and which have low ventilation rate (relative to the volume and number of visitors), daily and seasonal hygroscopic inertia may help to assure the maintenance of RH stabilization conditions. The use of expensive active systems may be minimized through the passive behaviour of internal finishing building materials. This work presents the results of an experimental laboratory study conducted in a flow chamber to demonstrate the enormous potential of hygroscopic materials in stabilizing interior relative humidity.

Using the changes in the respiratory exchange ratio (RER; CO2 excretion divided by O-2 uptake) as a proxy for changes in bodily gas stores, we quantified time constants in response to hypoxia and hypercapnia in Cuvier's dwarf caiman. We confirm distinct and prolonged changes in RER during and after exposure to hypoxia or hypercapnia. Gas exchange transients were evaluated in reference to predictions from a two-compartment model of CO2 exchange to quantify the effects of the levels of hypoxia and hypercapnia, duration of hypercapnia (30-300 min) and body temperature (23 versus 33 degrees C). For hypercapnia, the transients could be adequately fitted by two-phase exponential functions, and slow time constants (after 300 min hypercapnia) concurred reasonably well with modelling predictions. The slow time constants for the decays after hypercapnia were not affected by the level of hypercapnia, but they increased (especially at 23 degrees C) with exposure time, possibly indicating a temporal and slow recruitment of tissues for CO2 storage. In contrast to modelling predictions, elevated body temperature did not reduce the time constants, probably reflecting similar ventilation rates in transients at 23 and 33 degrees C. Our study reveals that attainment of steady state for gas exchange requires considerable time and this has important implications for designing experimental protocols when studying ventilatory control and conducting respirometry.",,,,,"Wang, Tobias/I-7946-2013","Wang, Tobias/0000-0002-4350-3682",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,DEC 1,2016,219,23,,,,,3810,3821,,10.1242/jeb.143537,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.143537,,,,,,,,27618857,,,,,WOS:000388812200021,View Full Record in Web of Science

The average respiratory rate (RR) in the spring season was found significantly lower. On the other hand, the RR for the noon period in the summer was higher than in the fall and winter seasons (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between summer and fall seasons for C values. The highest value (96.62 ng/ml) was obtained in spring, whereas the lowest (60.58 ng/ml) in the fall.

The changes in THI values in different seasons, particularly between mornings and afternoons, indicated that thermal stress was evident, and that the animals became resistant to it eventually.

Both in the field and under laboratory conditions, this worm can feed on different types of food. In order to highlight the potential of H. diversicolor for aquaculture, specific growth rate (SGR), daily growth rate (DGR), survival rate and fatty acid profile of juvenile worms, fed with three different diets, were assessed. The experiments were conducted using juvenile polychaete from a controlled reproduction with wild adults. H. diversicolor individuals were fed with two commercial diets, seabream dry feed (Aquagold) and semi-wet pellets for reared sole (Moist Sole), and with a non-processed diet consisting on mackerel's fillets (Trachurus trachurus). Juveniles fed with Aquagold had the highest final individual weight (0.89 +/- 0.10 g). The SGR was higher in H. diversicolor fed with Aquagold and Moist Sole, (6.49 +/- 0.30% d(-1) and 6.54 +/- 0.06% d(-1), respectively. The highest DGR was observed for juveniles fed with Aquagold (0.146 +/- 0.02 g d(-1)). The survival rate of ragworms under different treatments ranged from 96 to 100%. Regarding the protein content, the Moist Sole diet provided the highest percentage of protein in the reared worms (8.87%). Results showed that the total fat content of the diets was reflected in the fat content of the reared worms. The Moist Sole diet treatment had the highest fat content (2.25%) and individuals fed with seabream dry feed showed similar results (2.18%), while the lowest percentage was observed for the mackerel diet (0.85%). According to the fatty acid profile, the major fatty acids found in the juveniles fed with the three different diets were palmitic (C 16:0), with a higher value in the individuals fed with mackerel's fillets. Oleic (C 18:1 n9), eicosapentaenoic (C 20:5 n3), docosahexaenoic (C 22:6 n3) and stearic (C 18:0) acids presented high values in H. diversicolor fed with all the experimental diets. Statement of Relevance: The common ragworm Hediste diversicolor is a potential high quality fatty acids source for reared fish and shrimp. Previous studies suggested that diet could be a relevant factor affecting the fatty acid composition of this polychaete (Luis and Passos, 1995).

In this study, a parametric uncertainty analysis is made on a typical model of upslope fire spread that is consistent with many other models in the framework of the heat transfer theory and the major equations of sub-models. The variation ranges of the model parameters are determined based on the experimental data and assumptions, thereby the rate of fire spread (ROS) is used as a target variable of model calculation to evaluate the response of the model to parametric uncertainties. It is found that the values of ignition temperatures and averaged flame temperatures have significant impacts on the predicted values of ROS under lower slopes. Although the impacts decrease with the increase of slope, they are still non-negligible under higher slopes. Especially under lower slopes, the assumed values of both temperatures have significant effects on model prediction. The error in estimating the flame length has a remarkable influence on model prediction, and especially, the flame length variation of the same magnitude results in consistent relative errors under different slopes. A larger fluctuation range around a fixed average flame length results in a greater deviation from the predicted results, while for the same fluctuation range of flame length, the relative errors under higher slope angles are distinctly greater than those under lower slopes. In contrast, the errors for evaluation of the flame tilt angle have negligible effects on model predictions. The flame emissivity has a remarkable effect on model prediction and thus should be adjusted to better characterize the variation of flame intensity under different slopes. Besides, the prediction of ROS is very sensitive to the evaluation of fuel consumption efficiency, especially for higher slope angles. Simulation results indicate that larger heat convection coefficients are required for achieving better prediction results for higher slope angles, which agrees well with the previous experimental finding that with the increase of slope angle, a kind of flame-induced convection plays a more and more important role in fire spread.

The simulations start from a fluid which is at rest but has appreciable temperature fluctuations. Therefore the flow initially evolves by extracting energy from the potential energy field. Three free parameters, the Reynolds number Re, the Prandtl number Pr and the stratification number St, characterize the flow. Among these numbers the stratification number, St = (l(T0)/T0') (dT(R)/dz), is the most crucial one for the investigated problem. Here T0' and l(T0) are the initial r.m.s. temperature and the initial integral temperature lengthscale, respectively, and dT(R)/dz is the background stratification. St is a measure of the strength of background-temperature gradient compared to the initial mean fluctuating temperature gradient in the fluid. A critical stratification number of order one is found to separate an oscillating, non-turbulent flow from flow states which exhibit features of turbulence. When St > 1, the statistics reveal a nearly linear and strongly anisotropic flow as typical for gravity waves but the flow-field variables behave randomly. When St < 1, i.e. when the initial gradient of fluctuating temperature exceeds the gradient of its background value, the available potential energy is sufficient to create nonlinear motions which resemble turbulence in many aspects. The properties of such a flow are a transient state of enhanced stirring and mixing. enhanced rates of dissipation of temperature fluctuations, and a quick return to isotropy. The stratification number is an easily measurable parameter in field experiments in the ocean as well as in the atmosphere. Therefore St may be a useful indicator of whether a flow regime contains sufficient potential energy to create turbulence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1120,,,,,APR,1993,249,,,,,,415,440,,10.1017/S0022112093001235,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112093001235,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993KZ44700019,View Full Record in Web of Science

To investigate their direct and indirect effects on a near-natural plankton community, a multiple-stressor approach is needed. Hence, we set up mesocosms in a full-factorial design to study the effects of both warming and high CO2 on a Baltic Sea autumn plankton community, concentrating on the impacts on microzooplankton (MZP). MZP abundance, biomass, and species composition were analysed over the course of the experiment. We observed that warming led to a reduced time-lag between the phytoplankton bloom and an MZP biomass maximum. MZP showed a significantly higher growth rate and an earlier biomass peak in the warm treatments while the biomass maximum was not affected. Increased pCO(2) did not result in any significant effects on MZP biomass, growth rate, or species composition irrespective of the temperature, nor did we observe any significant interactions between CO2 and temperature. We attribute this to the high tolerance of this estuarine plankton community to fluctuations in pCO(2), often resulting in CO2 concentrations higher than the predicted end-of-century concentration for open oceans. In contrast, warming can be expected to directly affect MZP and strengthen its coupling with phytoplankton by enhancing its grazing pressure.",,,,,"Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013; Aberle, Nicole/C-7366-2014; Horn, Henriette G./R-7667-2016","Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X; Aberle, Nicole/0000-0003-3254-5710; Horn, Henriette G./0000-0002-4020-5559",,,,,,,,,,,,,1054-3139,1095-9289,,,,FEB-MAR,2016,73,3,,,,,772,782,,10.1093/icesjms/fsv198,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsv198,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000371142000026,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper had as main goal to test the influence of the exogenous factors in the synchrony in spatially isolated (i.e., no dispersal) populations of Sitophilus zeamais (Mots.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in microcosms with different environmental conditions (humidity, temperature and light intensity). Twelve populations of 20 individuals each, were randomly assigned between two treatment conditions: with or without light. Population size and environmental factors (temperature and relative humidity) were weekly assessed for seven months. Temporal trend in populations increase was eliminated adjusting autoregressive models. Population synchrony, detected by means of Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, was higher within than between treatments, although the populations kept without lamp were more synchronized than populations with lamp. Besides demonstrating the influence of environment on population fluctuations, these results suggest that metabolism and intra-specific interactions are important factors in population dynamic. Organisms exposed to unsuitable environmental conditions may have abnormal metabolic rates, which negatively influences the population grow. Thus, small populations are more likely to suffer from demographic stochasticity, decreasing the probability of the synchrony among populations. On the other hand, in more suitable environments, individuals are expected to have normal metabolic functions, and so, to achieve higher rates of population grow. In this case, the demographic stochasticity has smaller influence, leading populations without lamp to fluctuate synchronously.",,,,,"Pinto, Míriam Plaza/B-8000-2013; LIMA-RIBEIRO, MATHEUS S./H-9503-2014; Nabout, João/I-2828-2014","Pinto, Míriam Plaza/0000-0002-4030-5015; LIMA-RIBEIRO, MATHEUS S./0000-0002-3322-1702; Nabout, João/0000-0001-9102-3627",,,,,,,,,,,,,1519-566X,1678-8052,,,,SEP-OCT,2007,36,5,,,,,662,669,,10.1590/S1519-566X2007000500005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1519-566X2007000500005,,,,,,,,18060290,,,,,WOS:000251136300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Elliott, JM; Hurley, MA",,,,"Elliott, JM; Hurley, MA",,,Predicting fluctuations in the size of newly emerged sea-trout fry in a Lake District stream,JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The objective was to predict interannual fluctuations in the size of sea-trout fry when they emerged from the redd, using models developed from field data for 70 excavated redds (less than or equal to three per year), and from experimental data on egg and alevin development at 30 constant temperatures in the laboratory (range 1.5-10.5 degrees C with 100 naturally fertilized eggs at each temperature). Egg weight increased with female length and also with the number of eggs laid in a redd, both relationships being well described by a power function. Early spawners were the largest females laying the largest and most numerous eggs, whilst late spawners were the smallest females laying the smallest and least numerous eggs, with middle spawners being intermediate between these two extremes. Mean values for egg weight and number of eggs per redd were obtained for these three groups. The numbers of early, middle and late spawners for each year of a 30-year study and the mean values from the excavated redds were used to estimate weighted means for the number of eggs per unit area and egg weight. Mean values varied considerably between years (30-year ranges: 518-7964 eggs per 60 m(2); 112-138 mg wet weight). In the laboratory, mean weights of newly hatched alevins and newly emerged fry were both related positively to mean egg weights. Alevin and fry mean wrights were independent of the number of days required for 50% of the eggs to hatch or fry to emerge. Models described in a previous paper formed the basis of those used to predict fry weights over the emergence period. Model predictions were validated by field data for the whole emergence period in 8 years (1967-1971, 1974, 1975, 1980), and by pre-fry weights on single dates in 21 years (1967-1987). As pre-fry densities on these single dates were very similar to egg densities for the same year class, mortality in the egg and alevin stages was very low. The chief objective was therefore fulfilled, and the extent of interannual fluctuations for the 30-year study showed some variation in mean fry weight (30-year ranges: 153-193 mg for both the whole emergence period and the date on which 50% of fry emerged) but a progressive decrease in fry weight through the emergence period. Possible reasons for this variation are discussed, and it is concluded that the size of the female spawners is the dominant factor.

The high-frequency sampling was obtained using a visibility meter upgraded by our research group. To make the results more reliable, we restricted the service conditions of this method, that is, RH < 80% and the limited visibility value (15 km herein). The method was applied to a period of pollution from 27 December 2018 to 7 January 2019 at the Pingyuan site, located in the North China Plain. A 1-Hz fluctuation of the mass concentration of PM2.5 was obtained, as was the vertical turbulent flux of the mass concentration of PM2.5, The mean flux of the mass concentration of PM2.5 for the entire 13 days was 0.022 g m(-2) s(-1). The turbulent fluxes in five short-term pollution cases lasting for several hours or several days were -0.015 mu g m(-2) s(-1), -0.03 mu g m(-2) s(-1), 0.053 mu g m(-2) s(-1), 0.023 mu g m(-2) s(-1) and 0.075 mu g m(-2) s(-1). Then, the relationship between the absolute value of the vertical flux of PM2.5 mass concentration (W'C') over bar and many turbulent variables showed that the vertical flux decreases exponentially with the increase of variables such as turbulent kinetic energy, standard deviation a sigma(u), sigma(w), horizontal mean wind U, momentum flux tau and heat flux H. However, the absolute value of the vertical flux (W'C') over bar was not affected by the value of the mass concentration of PM2.5. The turbulent characteristics of PM2.5 were also analysed. Under unstable conditions, the normalized standard deviation of PM2.5 sigma(c)/C* = 20.07(-z/L)(-1/3). where c is mass concentration of PM2.5, C-* is scale of PM2.5.The normalized spectra (nS(PM2.5)(n)/sigma(2)(c)) followed the Kolmogorov form n(-2/3), where n is frequency, and the co-spectra of deviation of vertical wind speed and mass concentration of PM2.5 (nC(wPM2.5)(n)/sigma(w)sigma(c)) was n(-4/3). Finally, the universal function of the mass concentration of PM2.5 was calculated. The fitted curves for unstable and stable conditions were phi(c)(z/L) = 4.0(1-9.8z/L)(-1/2) and phi(c)(z/L) = 4.0(1 + 1.2 z/L). Although the observed values of the universal function of the mass concentration of PM2.5 were widely scattered with respect to z/L, the trend is obvious. The measurements show that PM2.5 has similar properties to regular scalars such as potential temperature or water vapor. Particularly, the measurement shows a good trend to satisfy the traditional Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST). However, further experiments should be implemented for verification and to provide a more accurate coefficient. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the processes driving changes in algal abundance and community structure requires clarification of the relative effects of top-down (e.g., herbivory) and bottom-up processes (e.g., light, temperature, and nutrients). To date, a number of studies have examined the relative effects of grazing versus nutrification but interactions between herbivory and natural, seasonal fluctuations in temperature and light have not been investigated. This study considered the dynamics of three Caribbean macroalgal species [Lobophora variegata (Lamouroux), Dictyota pulchella (Hornig and Schnetter), and Halimeda opuntia (Linnaeus)] and algal turf. A field experiment was established to measure species-specific algal dynamics (changes in abundance) over 13 months in the presence and absence of herbivory. Both herbivory and seasonal changes were important processes controlling macroalgal and turf abundance. Water temperature and light had a key role on D. pulchella; this species' abundance significantly increased in the summer, when water temperature and light were the highest, and decreased during winter. Surprisingly, herbivory did not seem to control D. pulchella directly. However, herbivory was the most important process controlling the abundance of L. variegata, H. opuntia, and turf. The abundance of both algal species was correlated with seasonal changes in the environment, but was depleted outside cages throughout the year. The abundance of H. opuntia was positively correlated with temperature and light, but there was no statistical interaction between drivers. The statistical interaction between temperature and light was significant for the abundance of L. variegata and turf, but algal abundance declined as both factors increased. Overall, macroalgal and turf cover were mainly controlled by herbivory, while community structure (which species contributed to the overall cover) was largely influenced by seasonal changes in temperature and light.",,,,,"González-Rivero, Manuel/A-3482-2016; Ferrari, Renata/E-3109-2016; Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010; Ortiz Cuellar, Juan carlos/GQZ-3899-2022","González-Rivero, Manuel/0000-0003-0252-584X; Ferrari, Renata/0000-0002-5056-1178; Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0722-4028,,,,,SEP,2012,31,3,,,,,683,692,,10.1007/s00338-012-0889-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-012-0889-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000307287400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate warming is advancing the onset of spring snowmelt and may lengthen the summer-dry state and ultimately cause drier soil conditions. The magnitude of either response may vary across elevation and vegetation types. We situated our study at the lower boundary of persistent snow cover and the upper boundary of subalpine forest with paired treatment blocks in aspen forest and open meadow. In treatments plots, we advanced snowmelt timing by an average of 14 days by adding dust to the snow surface during spring melt. We specifically wanted to know whether early snowmelt would increase the duration of the summer-dry period and cause soils to be drier in the early-snowmelt treatments compared with control plots. We found no difference in the onset of the summer-dry state and no significant differences in soil moisture between treatments. To better understand the reasons soil moisture did not respond to early snowmelt as expected, we examined the mediating influences of soil organic matter, texture, temperature, and the presence or absence of forest. In our study, late-spring precipitation may have moderated the effects of early snowmelt on soil moisture. We conclude that landscape characteristics, including soil, vegetation, and regional weather patterns, may supersede the effects of snowmelt timing in determining growing season soil moisture, and efforts to anticipate the impacts of climate change on seasonally snow-covered ecosystems should take into account these mediating factors.

In this study, we estimated the monthly seawater temperature below 2000 m from 2005-2015 by combining Array for Real-time Geostrophic Oceanography (Argo) and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) data. For this purpose, we divided the global ocean into 38 regions according to the CTD temperature profile properties. For each region, we used CTD data to construct a mathematical model to describe the relation of temperatures between 1000-2000 m and those below 2000 m. We then used this mathematical model and the Argo data to reconstruct the temperature profile below 2000 m and evaluate its thermostatic contribution to sea level change. We discovered that the deep ocean below 2000 m contributed 0.12 +/- 0.03 mm/yr to the mean global thermosteric sea level rise from 2005-2015. Our result was confirmed by geodetic observations, i.e., the rate of thermosteric sea level rise calculated using altimeter, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and Argo data was approximately 0.15 +/- 0.41 mm/yr. The contribution of each ocean layer generally decreased with depth, and there was an obvious fluctuation between approximately 4000-5000 m, interpreted as being caused by geothermal heating of the ocean floor.

After acute thermal shock, cortisol and glucose levels increased during the first hour in the experimental group. However, cortisol and glucose levels returned to their normal values after 6 and 36 h, respectively. Lysozyme activity decreased at 3 h and rose to its normal level at 12 h after the experiment. Total protein and serum ion concentrations were also affected and fluctuated due to acute thermal stress. Short-term acute thermal exposure also caused a serum ionic imbalance in the trout, but homeostasis was restored at 72 h.",,,,,"AKHAN, SULEYMAN/B-9159-2016","AKHAN, SULEYMAN/0000-0002-9122-1495",,,,,,,,,,,,,1300-0128,,,,,,2017,41,3,,,,,400,406,,10.3906/vet-1606-32,http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/vet-1606-32,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000403699500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

A second concept is that of fluctuations. Without fluctuations, proteins would be dead and life impossible. A third concept is slaving.

Low tides in Hawaii fluctuate < 1 m yet expose intertidal macroalgae to high tropical temperatures and irradiances, which are predicted to have negative physiological consequences. To better understand environmental variations, temperature, exposure duration, and irradiance were measured in two intertidal zones on O'ahu over 8 days with negative tidal heights. Then to test whether these conditions were stressful, the photosynthetic response (via pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry) and relative water content of a common intertidal macroalgae, Padina sanctae-crucis, was measured over varying tidal heights. We found that P. sanctae-crucis was exposed to air from 0 to 6 h on days with tropical irradiance (237-2000 A mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)) and a range of temperatures (20.4-32.3 A degrees C), yet plants were able to maintain relatively high water content. Photosynthetic parameters for P. sanctae-crucis derived from light response curves were found to vary with irradiance. High irradiances were associated with lowered maximum rates of electron transport (rETR(max)) and effective quantum yield (I broken vertical bar (PSII)). It was also determined that macroalgae exhibited different curves with tidal state. P. sanctae-crucis had relatively increased saturation irradiances (E (k)) and increased rETR(max) but lowered effective quantum yield (I broken vertical bar (PSII)) during negative tidal heights when aerial exposure is more common. P. sanctae-crucis was then exposed to air for up to 40 min in a laboratory experiment to determine the effect on fluorescence parameters. The 40-min aerial exposure, a duration smaller than which occurs at low tide, resulted in reduced rETR(max), alpha, and I broken vertical bar (PSII). This manipulation combined with field observations indicate that aggregations of thalli combined with water motion and minimal tidal fluctuations help to limit water loss and maintain photosynthetic rates. From these results, we can conclude, for this system, high irradiances are a major factor that likely limits production.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,MAY,2015,162,5,,,,,1061,1076,,10.1007/s00227-015-2649-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-015-2649-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000352798800013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Soret band profile is modeled as a Voigt function that accounts for the coupling with high and low frequency vibrational modes, while inhomogeneous broadening is taken into account with suitable distributions of purely electronic transition frequencies. This analysis makes it possible to isolate the various contributions to the overall lineshape that, in turn, give information on structural and dynamic properties of the systems studied. The optical spectroscopy data point out sizable differences between elephant myoglobin on one hand and horse and sperm.whale myoglobins on the other. These differences, more pronounced in deoxy derivatives, involve both the structure and dynamics of the heme pocket; in particular, elephant myoglobin appears to be characterized by larger anharmonic contributions to soft modes than the other two proteins. Flash photolysis data are analyzed as sums of kinetic processes with temperature-dependent fractional amplitudes, characterized by discrete pre-exponentials and either discrete or distributed activation enthalpies. In the whole temperature range investigated the behavior of elephant myoglobin appears to be more complex than that of horse and sperm whale myoglobins, which is in agreement with the increased anharmonic contributions to soft modes found in the former protein. Thus, to satisfactorily fit the time courses for CO recombination to elephant myoglobin five distinct processes are needed, only one of which is populated over the whole temperature range investigated. The remarkable convergence and complementarity between optical spectroscopy and flash photolysis data confirms the utility of combining these two experimental techniques in order to gain new and deeper insights into the functional relevance of protein fluctuations.",,,,,"Leone, Maurizio/F-2353-2010","Leone, Maurizio/0000-0002-0292-7657",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3495,1542-0086,,,,DEC,1993,65,6,,,,,2461,2472,,10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81311-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81311-0,,,,,,,,8312484,,,,,WOS:A1993MM05400021,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experiment was carried out from 1993 to 1996 at an experimental pasture in the Jizerske hory mountains (lat. 51 degrees 20' N, long. 15 degrees 02' W; the altitude is 420 m; the average annual precipitation is 803 mm; the mean annual temperature is 7.2 degrees C). The dominant species are couch grass [Elytrigia repens (L.) Desv.], ryegrass (Lolium;perenne L.), rough bluegrass (Poa trivialis L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L,), white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Web.). No fertilizers have been applied since 1992. There were two treatments: rotational grazing (R) and continuous grazing (K), both of them on 1.0 ha. The areas were grazed by five young Czech Pied I heifers in 1993 and by six young Friesian x Czech Pied heifers in 1994, 1995 and 1996 (the average initial weights of the heifers ranged from 135 to 180 kg). The area of (R) was divided into six paddocks, each measuring about 0.166 ha, and heifers were grazed from one paddock to another. The sward at (K) was maintained at a height of 5 to 7.5 cm by varying the grazing area available for treatment and by reducing the number of heifers in late summer. Each week, samples of herbage were taken to simulate herbage grazed by the heifers and were subsequently dried and analysed for nutrients and minerals. The mean contents of nutrients and minerals are given in Tabs I and Il. A surplus of crude protein (CP) and K was found in forage at rotational and continuous grazing, however, there was a shortage of energy, crude fibre (CF) and Ne. These results are typical for pasture forage in our climatic conditions. Significant differences in the content of CP (P < 0.01) and CF (P < 0.001) were found between both grazing systems, where at continuous grazing the content of CP was about 10% higher and the content of CF about 10% lower than at rotational grazing. This seemed to be due to greater CP and lower CF content in younger lower award at continuous grazing with a higher rate of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) in sward (Fig. 1). Also the tendency of a higher total minerals content at continual grazing can be connected with the different rate of white clover. Especially higher content of Ca and Mg (P < 0.05) at continual grazing was probably caused by white clover, that has a generally higher content of Ca and Mg than grasses. The higher rate of Na in pasture forage at continual grazing greatly decreased (P < 0.01) the ratio of K/Na. The ratio of K/Ca+Mg in meg. was at both variants always lower than the limit value 2.2. The differences in quality of pasture forage did not strongly affect the average daily liveweight gain of heifers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0370-663X,,,,,JUN,1998,44,6,,,,,287,292,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000074490000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experiment was conducted in Guadeloupe (French West Indies, latitude 61 degrees N, longitude 61 degrees W) between May 2002 and July 2004. Average daily ambient temperature was greater during the hot season than during the warm season (26.0 vs. 23.8 degrees C), but relative humidity was similar in both seasons (85% on average). The daily fluctuations of ambient temperature and relative humidity were similar for both seasons. At farrowing, BW was lower (187 vs. 265 kg) and backfat thickness was greater (40 vs. 22 min) in CR than in LW sows (P < 0.01). Sows were offered feed ad libitum between the fifth and the 26th day of lactation. There was a breed x season interaction (P < 0.05) for ADFI. During the hot season the reduction of ADFI was more pronounced in LW than in CR sows (-1,100 vs. -300 g/d). Irrespective of breed and season, the daily number of meals was 9.0. The meal size and the rate of feed intake were greater in LW than in CR sows, respectively (555 g and 153 g/min vs. 390 g and 83 g/min; P < 0.01). The diurnal proportion of ADFI was greater in CR than in LW sows (0.60 vs. 0.41; P < 0.01). The reduction in ADFI in LW sows during the hot season was mainly related to a reduction in feed intake during the day rather than during the night (-1.3 vs. -0.2 kg; P < 0.01). Duration of standing was not affected by breed or season, and it averaged 120 min/day. This study confirms the negative effect of the hot season on feeding behavior of lactating sows.

Moreover, the maximum values of gas exchange and water relations were recorded at thiourea priming and no stress as compared with no-priming under heat stress that helped to improve seed yield by 12% in 7126 and 15% in 8046, respectively. Among the varieties, camelina variety 8046 showed better performance than 7126 by producing higher seed yield especially when subjected to thiourea priming.

During that process, cloud albedo changes gradually, followed by a sudden reduction in cloud fraction and albedo as drizzle forms and convection changes from closed to open cellular. Experiments in a cloud chamber that generates a turbulent environment show a similar cloud cleansing process followed by rapid cloud collapse. Observations of (1) cloud droplet size distribution, (2) interstitial aerosol size distribution, (3) cloud droplet residual size distribution, and (4) water vapor supersaturation are all consistent with the hypothesis that turbulent fluctuations of supersaturation accelerate the cloud cleansing process and eventual cloud collapse. Decay of the interstitial aerosol concentration occurs slowly at first then more rapidly. The accelerated cleansing occurs when the cloud phase relaxation time exceeds the turbulence correlation time. Plain Language Summary Initially, polluted clouds can slowly transform into clean clouds when there is no significant source of aerosol particles. The rate at which this aerosol removal occurs, which can be thought of as cloud cleansing, undergoes a sudden acceleration when a cloud becomes sufficiently clean. Cloud chamber experiments show that random, turbulent fluctuations become large when a cloud becomes sufficiently clean, and these large fluctuations in temperature and the concentration of water vapor cause rapid activation of aerosol particles and rapid growth of cloud droplets. In the atmosphere these large droplets would be expected to aid in initiating the formation of precipitation by collisions and coalescence of droplets.",,,,,"Chandrakar, Kamal Kant/E-8259-2018","Chandrakar, Kamal Kant/0000-0003-2970-3458; Karki, Sarita/0000-0001-9562-0787; Cantrell, Will/0000-0001-9227-8701; Shaw, Raymond/0000-0003-0390-2424",,,,,,,,,,,,,0094-8276,1944-8007,,,,MAY 16,2017,44,9,,,,,4359,4367,,10.1002/2017GL072762,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017GL072762,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000402143700047,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the Boreal Shield, mean annual air temperatures are expected to increase 2 to 4degreesC over the next 50 years. An important challenge is to predict how changes in climate and climate variability will impact natural systems so that sustainable management policies can be implemented. To predict responses to complex ecosystem changes associated with climate change, we used long-term biotic databases to evaluate how important elements of the biota in Boreal Shield lakes have responded to past fluctuations in climate. Our long-term records span a two decade period where there have been unusually cold years and unusually warm years. We used coherence analyses to test for regionally operating controls on climate, water temperature, pH, and plankton richness and abundance in three regions across Ontario: the Experimental Lakes Area, Sudbury, and Dorset. Inter-annual variation in air temperature was similar among regions, but there was a weak relationship among regions for precipitation. While air temperature was closely related to lake surface temperatures in each of the regions, there were weak relationships between lake surface temperature and richness or abundance of the plankton. However, inter-annual changes in lake chemistry (i.e., pH) were correlated with some biotic variables. In some lakes in Sudbury and Dorset, pH was dependent on extreme events. For example, El Nino related droughts resulted in acidification pulses in some lakes that influenced phytoplankton and zooplankton richness.

It is proposed here that these thermohaline filaments result from the mesoscale stirring of large-scale temperature and salinity gradients by geostrophic turbulence, resulting in a direct cascade of thermohaline variance to small scales. This hypothesis is investigated as follows: Measurements from NATRE are used to generate mean temperature, salinity, and shear profiles. The mean stratification and shear are used as the background state in a high-resolution horizontally homogeneous quasigeostrophic model. The mean state is baroclinically unstable, and the model produces a vigorous eddy field. Temperature and salinity are stirred laterally in each density layer by the geostrophic velocity and vertical advection is by the ageostrophic velocity. The simulated temperature-salinity diagram exhibits fluctuations at depths just below the thermocline of similar magnitude to those found in the NATRE data. It is shown that vertical diffusion is sufficient to absorb the laterally driven cascade of tracer variance through an amplification of filamentary slopes by small-scale shear. These results suggest that there is a strong coupling between vertical mixing and horizontal stirring in the ocean at scales below the deformation radius.",,,,,"Ferrari, Raffaele/C-9337-2013; Smith, Kendall/A-4581-2017","Ferrari, Raffaele/0000-0002-3736-1956; Smith, Kendall/0000-0003-0740-3067",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,1520-0485,,,,OCT,2009,39,10,,,,,2477,2501,,10.1175/2009JPO4103.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2009JPO4103.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000270851500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Four analytical methods provide independent information on the aerosol composition and structure (measurements of Mie scattering, Raman scattering, scattering fluctuations, and of mass). The morphology of the aerosol particles and the water uptake and drying behavior are investigated including the determination of deliquescence and efflorescence relative humidities. In general, the thermodynamic data derived from our measurements are in good agreement with previous work. The observed solid phase is mostly, letovicite [(NH4)(3)H(SO4)(2)] and sometimes ammonium sulfate [(NH4)(2)SO4], whereas ammonium bisulfate [(NH4)HSO4] does not nucleate at temperatures between 260 and 270 K despite supersaturation over periods of up to I day. This underlines the atmospheric importance of letovicite, which has been ignored in most previous studies concentrating on ammonium sulfate. When the stoichiometry of the aqueous solution in the droplets is chosen as neither that of ammonium sulfate nor letovicite, the particles forming after efflorescence are mixed-phase particles (solid/liquid), representing the usual case in the natural atmosphere. Upon crystallization these mixed-phase particles reveal a range of different morphologies with a tendency to form complex crystalline structures with embedded liquid cavities, but there is no evidence for the occurrence of crystalline material surrounded by the remaining liquid. This liquid possibly resides in grain boundaries or triple junctions between single crystals or in small pores and shows little mobility upon extensive drying, unless the shell-like surrounding solid cracks.",,,,,"Krieger, Ulrich K/E-2916-2016; Peter, Thomas/B-2529-2018","Krieger, Ulrich K/0000-0003-4958-2657; Peter, Thomas/0000-0002-7218-7156",,,,,,,,,,,,,1089-5639,1520-5215,,,,APR 8,2004,108,14,,,,,2700,2709,,10.1021/jp037628r,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp037628r,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000220640000017,View Full Record in Web of Science

This optimization is often achieved by changing one factor at a time. However, this may lead to suboptimal results, since interactions between conditions are difficult to detect with this approach. In the present study, we describe the factorial optimization of PCR conditions for microsatellite genotyping, by introducing small systematic variations in conditions during the genotyping process. The hypothesis was that small changes will not affect genotyping results, but will provide information about the optimality of current conditions. The conditions to vary were the concentrations of buffer, MgCl2, dNTPs, primers, Taq polymerase and DNA, the annealing temperature (T-a) and the number of cycles. We show that, by a 2(8) factorial experiment, it is possible to identify not only the factors responsible for obtaining good results, but also those responsible for bad results.

The targeted micro-organism has to be identified accurately, among competitive flora. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transformed strains is a possible answer to such issues. However, quantitative studies require that this transformation does not alter the micro-organism behaviour: parent and transformed organisms were thus compared. Methods and Results: Three Escherichia colt O157:H7 strains were transformed using a GFP-plasmid expressing. Parent and transformed strains were compared according to their genetic characteristics and serotypes. Growth ability was also assessed in constant and fluctuating temperature profiles. Cardinal values of pH, water activity and temperature were computed. No differences were observed between parent and transformed strains for all these experiments. The plasmid was satisfactorily maintained within transformed strains throughout the studies. Growth was eventually monitored in beef meat. Conclusions: Using the GFP marker is of great value, as it allows easier enumeration of E. colt O157:H7 in food in the presence of natural microflora.

Experimental colonies were derived from clones that had been reproducing for at least 15 months under constant laboratory conditions. At constant 20-23-degrees-C, sexuparae were almost never produced regardless of the level of crowding or photoperiod. In contrast, every culture of several clones produced sexuparae when subjected to temperatures alternating between 20 and 15-degrees-C during the light and dark phases respectively. This fluctuating temperature regime resulted in sexupara production regardless of photoperiod. All cultures also produced some sexuparae when cultures were kept in constant darkness at temperatures that were either alternated between 20 and 15-degrees-C or kept constant at 15-degrees-C. Constant 17-degrees-C resulted in sexupara production in most cultures. At 17-degrees-C, experimental manipulation of densities within cultures showed that crowding promotes sexupara production. Thus, within the range of conditions occurring at the time of sexupara induction in the field, photoperiod has no effect on sexupara production, temperature below a threshold between 17 and 20-23-degrees-C triggers sexupara production, and crowding promotes sexupara production but only if temperature is low enough.",,,,,"Moran, Nancy A/G-1591-2010",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6962,,,,,SEP,1993,18,3,,,,,296,302,,10.1111/j.1365-3032.1993.tb00602.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3032.1993.tb00602.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LX43200011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several studies have therefore suggested a link between preservation of V-m and cellular survival after cold stress, but none has measured V-m in this context. We tested this hypothesis by acclimating locusts (Locusta migratoria) to high (31 degrees C) and low temperature (11 degrees C) for 4 days before exposing them to cold stress (0 degrees C) for up to 48 h and subsequently measuring ion balance, cell survival, muscle V-m, and whole animal performance. Cold stress caused gradual muscle cell death, which coincided with a loss of ion balance and depolarization of muscle V-m. The loss of ion balance and cell polarization were, however, dampened markedly in cold-acclimated locusts such that the development of chill injury was reduced. To further examine the association between cellular injury and V-m we exposed in vitro muscle preparations to cold buffers with low, intermediate, or high [K+]. These experiments revealed that cellular injury during cold exposure occurs when V-m becomes severely depolarized. Interestingly, we found that cellular sensitivity to hypothermic hyperkalaemia was lower in cold-acclimated locusts that were better able to defend V-m whilst exposed to high extracellular [K+]. Together these results demonstrate a mechanism of cold acclimation in locusts that improves survival after cold stress: increased cold tolerance is accomplished by preservation of V-m through maintenance of ion homeostasis and decreased K+ sensitivity.",,,,,"Overgaard, Johannes/I-7493-2013; Overgaard, Johannes/AAA-3922-2022","Overgaard, Johannes/0000-0002-2851-4551; Kuhlmann Andersen, Mads/0000-0002-6215-8941",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,FEB 1,2017,220,3,,,,,487,496,,10.1242/jeb.150813,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.150813,,,,,,,,27903702,,,,,WOS:000394100300026,View Full Record in Web of Science

As bays formed where tributaries enter the Three Gorges Reservoir of China have experienced frequent algal blooms over the past decade, we examine the spatially variable flushing time of a typical tributary bay (Xiangxi Bay) by numerical tracer experiments. First, the tracer concentration reduction could be approximated well by a double exponential decay curve, and the local flushing time of Xiangxi Bay is determined using key flushing coefficients. Second, a sensitivity analysis is performed to examine the influence of upstream inflow, temperature difference, wind, water level of the reservoir, and daily water level fluctuation on the spatial variation in local flushing time. Finally, according to local flushing time values and the sensitivity analysis results, the bay can be generally characterized by three zones: riverine, transitional, and mainstream-influenced zones. In particular, the local flushing times in the riverine zone are mainly affected by the upstream inflow. The difference in temperature between the reservoir mainstream and Xiangxi Bay is the main forcing in the transitional and mainstream-influenced zones. This study is the first to investigate different driving factors for flushing time in a typical reservoir tributary bay.

Field measurements during winter show that the indoor temperature of a traditional house is low and fluctuates greatly, and the inner surface is prone to easy condensation. Through thermal comfort surveys, neutral and acceptable temperature ranges were obtained to provide indoor calculation parameters for an energy-saving design. Numerical simulations of heating energy consumption were conducted on the typical building models using DesignBuilder. The influence of different design factors on energy consumption was evaluated. Orthogonal experiments were designed to optimize a series of design parameter combinations to reduce the energy consumption of Zhalantun rural houses and to determine the sequence and significance of the effect of these design factors on energy consumption. Results show that the optimal parameter combination based on orthogonal experiments can obviously reduce energy consumption and have better economic benefits without considering mechanical methods.

R.",,,Disease recovery in bats affected by white-nose syndrome,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Processes associated with recovery of survivors are understudied components of wildlife infectious diseases. White-nose syndrome (WNS) in bats provides an opportunity to study recovery of disease survivors, understand implications of recovery for individual energetics, and assess the role of survivors in pathogen transmission. We documented temporal patterns of recovery from WNS in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) following hibernation to test the hypotheses that: (1) recovery of wing structure from WNS matches a rapid time scale (i.e. approximately 30 days) suggested by data from free-ranging bats; (2) torpor expression plays a role in recovery; (3) wing physiological function returns to normal alongside structural recovery; and (4) pathogen loads decline quickly during recovery. We collected naturally infected bats at the end of hibernation, brought them into captivity, and quantified recovery over 40 days by monitoring body mass, wing damage, thermoregulation, histopathology of wing biopsies, skin surface lipids and fungal load. Most metrics returned to normal within 30 days, although wing damage was still detectable at the end of the study. Torpor expression declined overall throughout the study, but bats expressed relatively shallow torpor bouts-with a plateau in minimum skin temperature-during intensive healing between approximately days 8 and 15. Pathogen loads were nearly undetectable after the first week of the study, but some bats were still detectably infected at day 40. Our results suggest that healing bats face a severe energetic imbalance during early recovery from direct costs of healing and reduced foraging efficiency. Management of WNS should not rely solely on actions during winter, but should also aim to support energy balance of recovering bats during spring and summer.",,,,,"McGuire, Liam/CAE-8434-2022; Pannkuk, Evan/ABF-6170-2021","Pannkuk, Evan/0000-0002-4953-9715; Haase, Catherine/0000-0002-7682-0625; Willis, Craig/0000-0002-0985-8607",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAR,2020,223,6,,,,,,,jeb211912,10.1242/jeb.211912,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.211912,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000541830200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, mathematical models predict the thermal performance of buildings that might differ from the actual performance. The hot box is a widely-used test apparatus to assess the actual thermal performance of various building envelope components (walls, roofs, windows) in the laboratory. This paper presents the process of designing, constructing, and calibrating a unique small-scale hot box apparatus. Despite its smaller metering area (1.0 m x 1.0 m), this apparatus met the key requirements (below +/- 0.25 degrees C fluctuations in chambers' air temperature, and below 2.0% variation from the point-to-point temperature in reference to the temperature difference across the specimen) as prescribed in the ASTM C1363 and ISO 8990 standards. The walls of this apparatus are uniquely constructed using vacuum insulation panels or VIPs. The efficient and novel use of VIPs and workmanship during the construction of the apparatus are demonstrated through the temperature stability within the chambers. The achieved range of temperature steadiness below +/- 0.05 degrees C and point-to-point temperature variation below 1.0% of the temperature difference across the specimen allow for this apparatus to be considered unique among the calibrated hot box categories reported in the literature. In addition, having an affordable, simple-to-operate, and high-accuracy facility offers a great opportunity for researchers and practitioners to investigate new ideas and solutions. The apparatus was calibrated using two extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) specimens with thicknesses of 2 '' and 4 ''. The calibration exercise indicates small differences between results obtained numerically, theoretically, and experimentally (below 3.0%). Ultimately, the apparatus was employed to measure the thermal properties of a specimen representing a lightweight steel framing (LSF) wall system, which is commonly used in cold climates. The results obtained experimentally were then compared to the ones estimated numerically using a 3D finite element modelling tool. The difference between the results obtained by both methods was below 9.0%.",,,,,,"Mukhopadhyaya, Phalguni/0000-0001-9424-971X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1996-1073,,,,JUL,2022,15,13,,,,,,,4677,10.3390/en15134677,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15134677,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000825541300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Habitats of the two taxa differ in hydroregime. The endemic Oenanthe conioides of the river Elbe estuary experiences daily tidal fluctuations whereas the widespread Oenanthe aquatica grows at the edge of ponds and in freshwater wetlands with rare and unpredictable fluctuations of water table. Seeds of both taxa could be characterized as non-dormant and light dependent. Under temperature fluctuations, germination percentage was higher than under constant temperatures. Salinity was tolerated to up to 3.3%.. At 10%. there was a strong decrease in germination percentage, which did not result from ionic toxicity, as experiments with a gradient in osmolarity showed. Differences between the taxa were found concerning hydrological and temperature fluctuations. While O. aquatica showed no reduction in germination percentage under permanent 1 cm flooding, O. conioides did. On the other hand, germination under an artificial tidal hydroregime was better in O. conioides than in O. aquatica. During fluctuating temperatures of 3/22 and 6/22 degrees C O. conioides germinated much quicker and had a higher final germination percentage. Differences between the taxa could be correlated with differences of the hydrological regime in the specific habitat. Taking into account that O. conioides is phylogenetically a relatively young taxon, it may be hypothesized that a quick adaptation to the tidal conditions might have taken place.

Studies of dormancy have recently attracted more attention due to the expansion of temperate fruit production in areas under mild winters and due to climate changes. This study aimed to identify and characterize the metabolic changes induced by chilling temperatures, as well as during thermal fluctuation conditions that simulate mild winter and/or climate change scenarios. To do this, we compared the metabolic profile of Japanese pear flower buds exposed to constant chilling at 6 degrees C and thermal fluctuations of 6 degrees C/18 degrees C (150h/150 h) during endodormancy. We detected 91 metabolites by gas chromatography paired with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) that could be classified into eight groups: amino acids, amino acid derivatives, organic acids, sugars and polyols, fatty acids and sterols, phenol lipids, phenylpropanoids, and other compounds. Metabolomics analysis revealed that the level of several amino acids decreased during endodormancy. Sugar and polyol levels increased during endodormancy during constant chilling and might be associated with chilling stress tolerance and providing an energy supply for resuming growth. In contrast, thermal fluctuations produced low levels of metabolites related to the pentose phosphate pathway, energy production, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in flower buds, which may be associated with failed endodormancy release. This metabolic profile contributes to our understanding of the biological mechanism of dormancy during chilling accumulation and clarifies the metabolic changes during mild winters and future climate change scenarios.",,,,,"Saito, Kazuki/D-2670-2009","Saito, Kazuki/0000-0001-6310-5342; Sugaya, Sumiko/0000-0003-1318-2627",,,,,,,,,,,,,0981-9428,,,,,MAY,2018,126,,,,,,134,141,,10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.02.028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.02.028,,,,,,,,29524800,,,,,WOS:000430777100015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Produced water is the primary by-product of oil and gas operations, and it has proven challenging to treat to date. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using forward osmosis with thin-film composite hollow fiber membranes as a remediation option for produced water with high total dissolved solids levels from the Permian Basin. Trials consisted of a series of 5 experiments in order to evaluate the performance of the membrane. Three PW samples, each from different locations, were used to conduct the series of experiments and compare the performance of the membranes on samples with TDS levels ranging from 16,000 to 210,000mg/L. It was concluded that forward osmosis can be used to extract water from high salinity oil field brines and PW. Flux decreased over the course of the trials due to a combination of membrane fouling, concentration polarization, and temperature fluctuations. The flux of the PW was similar to the flux measured for the PW mimic with small difference due to the influence of activity on the osmotic pressure. The flux was also influenced by temperature and the linear velocity of the feed solution and draw solution. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The cold hardiness of the alpine cockroach Celatoblatta quinquemaculata was investigated. This species is found at 1360 m a.s.l. beneath schist slabs on the Rock and Pillar Range (Central Otago, New Zealand). Cockroaches were collected monthly from January to December 1996, and their LT50 and supercooling points determined. 2. Celatoblatta quinquemaculata was freezing tolerant throughout the year, with a lower lethal temperature in winter of -8.9 degrees C. Celatoblatta quinquemaculata was also found frozen under rocks in the field when the under-rock temperature was below 3 degrees C, and could survive being frozen at -5 degrees C for 3 days in the laboratory. 3. There was a marked decrease in LT50 temperature from -5.5 degrees C in April to -7.5 degrees C in May. This coincides with decreasing temperatures from summer through autumn to winter, during which temperatures beneath snow-covered rocks may reach -7.3 degrees C. 4. Supercooling points fluctuated during the year, with an increase from -4.2 degrees C in autumn to -3.4 degrees C in winter. Supercooling point was highest in spring, and changes in supercooling point do not appear to be related to changes in LT50 5. Recordings of environmental temperatures from the Rock and Pillar Range suggest that cockroaches may undergo up to twenty-three freeze-thaw cycles in the coldest month of the year, and that they may remain frozen for periods of up to 21 h. Maximum cooling rates recorded in the field (0.01 degrees C min(-1)) were 100-fold slower than laboratory cooling rates, so survival estimates from laboratory experiments may be underestimates.",,,,,,"Sinclair, Brent/0000-0002-8191-9910",,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6946,1365-2311,,,,NOV,1997,22,4,,,,,462,467,,10.1046/j.1365-2311.1997.00087.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2311.1997.00087.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997YK36200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper reviews a large number of experiments and theoretical methods which have been applied in order to get a reliable physical picture. Many examples given here deal with myoglobin (Mb) which has been extensively investigated by several groups. It serves as a kind of 'model protein'. The comparison of experiments at unphysiologically low temperatures with those at physiological temperatures proved to be of great help to separate the general dynamics of solids and modes of motion, which are essential for the biological function and become activated only above a characteristic temperature which is often called the dynamical transition temperature. By normal mode analysis a good insight into the molecular vibrations has been obtained. Recently, the Mossbauer effect with synchrotron radiation has been used to determine a density spectrum of phonons coupling to the heme iron in Mb. From this spectrum the mean square displacements at the position of the iron were calculated. The results are compared with those from incoherent neutron scattering. A normal mode refinement of x-ray structures of Mb in the temperature range from 40 to 300 K is discussed, which was used to determine the zero point structural distributions of protein molecules. Protein specific motions above a characteristic temperature have been investigated by Mossbauer absorption spectroscopy and incoherent neutron scattering. Different models to analyse the experiments are discussed, in particular two 'state models' are compared. In the simplest case, atoms or groups of atoms jump between two positions which may be inequivalent in energy. At both positions they perform the same harmonic motions. In a more realistic assumption there are two types of states with different backdriving forces. At low temperatures the molecules are trapped in 'rigid' states which are often called 'conformational substates' in the literature. At increasing temperatures, the probability increases to reach states which allow more flexibility. In the model of a Brownian oscillator the motion in the flexible state is assumed-to be stochastic and overdamped. Besides structural distributions and fluctuations, this review discusses conformational relaxation occurring as a consequence of changes at the active centre of a protein. X-ray structure analysis has been able to characterize intermediates between different conformations. It becomes obvious that protein-specific motions within one conformation are the essential prerequisite for a conformational relaxation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0034-4885,1361-6633,,,,FEB,2003,66,2,,,,,103,129,PII S0034-4885(03)18830-6,10.1088/0034-4885/66/2/201,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0034-4885/66/2/201,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000181513100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The test cells were located in Portugal and were monitored over an entire year. The results revealed that the LSF experimental test cell presented higher daily indoor air temperature fluctuations, leading to more extreme maximum and minimum values, closely following the outdoor dry bulb temperature variations.

These responses are a combination of physiological acclimation and evolutionary responses. The latter occur rapidly within a few hundred generations (translating to a scale of months to years), due to the large standing genetic variation and short generation times of diatom populations. Studies are usually carried out on diatom species in their planktonic state, but this may constitute a stark oversimplification: diatoms readily form biofilms in the water column of shallow coastal areas, where biofilm formation affects carbon export, and in the benthos, where biofilms contribute significantly to sediment stability. Here, I have carried out a 400-generation selection experiment, where I evolved the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and its associated bacteria. Bacteria and diatom were cultured in their planktonic form, and under strong selection for rapid biofilm formation in temperature and nutrient regimes differing in their severity and stability. I find that biofilm formation is enhanced under mild warming and rapid thermal fluctuations but not under extreme warming regardless of nutrient availability. Evolutionary responses are slower in biofilms under benign conditions but speed up under extreme and fluctuating conditions. Taxonomic composition of the associated bacteria is driven by the temperature selection regime in biofilms but not in planktonic samples. I also show that T. pseudonana, when selected for biofilm formation, presents predictable and sequential morphologies that are not usually observed in planktonic T. pseudonana.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,MAR,2019,64,2,,,,,441,460,,10.1002/lno.11050,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11050,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000461865500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been demonstrated that such data can be used to predict bacterial growth in food products, both under conditions of constant and fluctuating temperatures. The purpose of the present study was to combine bacterial growth modelling with a heat transfer model describing the spatial temperature changes within a solid object, and to validate the model experimentally. Firstly, experimental growth data were attained for Escherichia coli W3110 immobilised in agar at fixed temperatures. Growth data were then fitted using predictive microbial models to represent growth in lag, exponential and stationary phases. When compared to growth in liquid cultures, similar values were found for maximum exponential growth rate. Next, experiments were conducted whereby a 91 vessel was filled with agar inoculated with E. coli and conduction cooled in a water bath. A finite difference scheme was used to model heat transfer from the vessel, and bacterial growth was consequently modelled as a function of temperature inside the vessel. Experimental results for bacterial growth showed good agreement with theory. The results show that it is feasible to combine engineering and microbial models. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is an invasive pest of potato that has rapidly spread from low latitudes to higher latitudes. During the last 30 years, a decrease in range expansion speed is apparent in Europe. We use a comparative approach to assess whether this could be due to an inability of L. decemlineata to cope with the harsher winters encountered at high latitude, when compared to two native northern chrysomelid beetles with similar overwintering ecology. We investigated several cold-tolerance-related physiological traits at different time points during winter. Cold tolerance followed a latitudinal pattern; the northern species were more tolerant to short-term subzero temperatures than the invasive L. decemlineata. The other northern species, the knotgrass leaf beetle, Chrysolina polita, was found to tolerate internal freezing. Interestingly, the pattern for overwinter survival at 5 degrees C was the opposite and higher in L. decemlineata than the northern species and could be related to behavioral differences between species in overwintering location selection and a potential physiological trade-off between tolerance to cold shock and to chronic cold exposure. Furthermore, while the northern species accumulated large amounts of different sugars and polyols with probable cryoprotectant functions, none were detected in L. decemlineata at high concentrations. This lack of cryoprotectant accumulation could explain the difference in cold tolerance between the species and also suggests that a lack of physiological capacity to tolerate low temperatures could slow further latitudinal range expansion of L. decemlineata.",,,,,"Lehmann, Philipp/AEO-0158-2022; Lindstrom, Leena/B-2326-2012; Kostal, Vladimir/G-6688-2014; Zahradnickova, Helena/H-1863-2014","Lindstrom, Leena/0000-0002-6452-4538; Kostal, Vladimir/0000-0002-4994-5123; Margus, Aigi/0000-0002-2546-8238; Lehmann, Philipp/0000-0001-8344-6830",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,1537-5293,,,,MAY-JUN,2015,88,3,,,,,254,265,,10.1086/680384,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/680384,,,,,,,,25860825,,,,,WOS:000352794300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research addressed susceptibility to photoinhibition of selected native grass species used to restore Canadian prairies, and reclamation treatments to alter environmental conditions in order to release seeds from photoinhibition. Under laboratory conditions effects of photoinhibition were tested on the ability of seeds to germinate at low water potential and effects of daily alternating temperatures and nitrates to break photoinhibition. Whether surficial mulch can release seeds from photoinhibition was assessed in a field experiment. Germination photoinhibition was evident in Festuca hallii and Koeleria macrantha seeds even under very low irradiances. The prolonged exposure to light decreased germination rates and ability of seeds to germinate at low water potentials. Daily fluctuating temperatures released a fraction of Bromus carinatus and Elymus trachycaulus seeds from photoinhibition yet did not improve F. hallii or K. macrantha germinability. Nitrates failed to break seed photoinhibition in all species tested. In the field experiment, mulched E hallii seeds (covered with an erosion control blanket) showed a tenfold increase in germination percentages relative to seeds exposed to direct sunlight, indicating the facilitative effects of mulching on attenuation of the light environment. We conclude that germination photoinhibition as a cause of emergence failures in land reclamation where seed is broadcast or shallow seeded should be recognized and germination photoinhibition included in the decision making process to select revegetation seeding techniques.

Our results showed considerable attenuation of temperature through the whole system of extensive green roofs (EVRs) in both summer and winter periods. The EVRs decreased the outside temperature from 44.6 ? to 34.7 ?. Temperatures for the EVR showed a lower peak-to-valley-gap and better anti-interference performance during the day and along the year. At the same time, thermal insulation provided by soil and vegetation layers resulted in a negative heat flux (-40 W/m(2)) reducing the incoming heat flux during the day. Almost all treatments showed >= 90% of plant survival and >= 60% of coverage after the experimental period. Microcosm treatments with the highest diversity showed the best performance in both the short and long terms (particularly those with the native Eustachys distichophylla and the exotic Sedum spp.).

Over the course of one year, changes in microbial biomass and total soil organic C pools were monitored alongside hourly measurements of soil CO2 flux. We also developed a biogeochemical model to explore the mechanisms that gave rise to observed soil C dynamics. Field data and model simulations demonstrated that water exerted much stronger control on soil biogeochemistry than temperature, with precipitation events triggering large CO2 pulses and transport of litter- and biocrust-derived C into the soil profile. We expected leaching of organic matter would result in steady accumulation of C within the mineral soil over time. Instead, the size of the total organic C pool fluctuated throughout the year, largely in response to microbial growth: increases in the size of microbial biomass were negatively correlated with the quantity of C residing in the top 2 cm, where most biogeochemical changes were observed. Our data and models suggest that microbial responses to precipitation events trigger rapid metabolism of dissolved organic C inputs, which strongly limit accumulation of autotroph-derived C belowground.

Finally, we check the validity of a fluctuation relation for the active work distribution. In the free-particle case, the relation is satisfied with a slope proportional to the bath temperature. The same slope is found for the harmonic potential, regardless of activity, and for an anharmonic potential with low activity.

The response is characterized through amplitude and phase propagation of the harmonics in order to differentiate between the response of the system to forcing at different frequencies (daily to hourly to near instantaneous). Stochastic noise is added to the surface energy balance. The amplitude of the noise is maximum at midday when the incoming radiative forcing is also at its peak. The temperatures and turbulent heat fluxes are shown to act as low-pass filters of the incoming radiation or energy budget noise variability at the surface. Conversely, soil heat flux is shown to act as a high-pass filter because of the strong contrast in the soil and air heat capacities and thermal conductivities. As a consequence, heat diffusion formulations that numerically dampen such forcing are potentially incapable of representing rapid fluctuations in soil heat flux (<= 30 min) and therefore introduce errors in the land-surface energy partitioning.

Stomatal closure and consequently reduced transpiration are considered as early and sensitive plant responses to drought and salinity stress. An important consequence of stomatal closure under water stress is the rise of leaf temperature (T-leaf), yet T-leaf is not only fluctuating with stomatal closure. It is regulated by several plant parameters and environmental factors. Thermal imaging and different stress indices, incorporating actual leaf/crop temperature and reference temperatures, were developed in previous studies toward normalizing for effects unassociated to water stress on T-leaf, aiming at a more efficient water stress assessment. The concept of stress indices has not been extensively studied on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the different indices employed in previous studies in assessing rosette transpiration rate (E) in Arabidopsis plants grown under two different light environments and subjected to salinity. After salinity imposition, E was gravimetrically quantified, and thermal imaging was employed to quantify rosette (T-rosette) and artificial reference temperature (T-wet,T- T-dry). T-rosette and several water stress indices were tested for their relation to E. Among the microclimatic growth conditions tested, RWSI1 ([T-rosette - T-wet]/[T-dry - T-wet]) and RWSI2 ([T-dry - T-rosette]/[T-dry - T-wet]) were well linearly-related to E, irrespective of the light environment, while the sole use of either T-wet or T-dry in different combinations with T-rosette returned less accurate results.

The Peleg equation adequately described the creep response of potatoes during storage at all storage conditions (R-2 = .97to .99). Peleg constant k(1) exhibited a significant (p < .05) decreasing trend with storage time (t(s)) for samples stored under the experimental conditions whereas the constant k(2) appeared to be unaffected much by ts except for samples stored at 25C. Under constant wtemperature storage, k(1) was found to be a linear function of t(s) (R-2 = .87 to .97). Also, the rate of change of k(1) appeared to be temperature dependent described by a linear relationship between the degradation rate constant for k(1) (alpha) and storage temperature (T). For the variable storage condition, a bulk mean temperature (T-bm) was calculated to account for a series combination of storage time and temperature which the potatoes were subjected to.

Numerous studies have shown the impact of single stressors on individual species. However, studies on the combined effect of multiple stressors on a multi-species assemblage, which is ecologically much more realistic and relevant, are still scarce. Therefore, we orthogonally crossed the two factors warming and acidification in mesocosm experiments and studied their single and combined impact on the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus associated with its natural community (epiphytes and mesograzers) in the Baltic Sea in all seasons (from April 2013 to April 2014). We superimposed our treatment factors onto the natural fluctuations of all environmental variables present in the Benthocosms in so-called delta-treatments. Thereby we compared the physiological responses of F. vesiculosus (growth and metabolites) to the single and combined effects of natural Kiel Fjord temperatures and pCO(2) conditions with a 5 degrees C temperature increase and/or pCO(2) increase treatment (1100ppm in the headspace above the mesocosms). Responses were also related to the factor photoperiod which changes over the course of the year. Our results demonstrate complex seasonal pattern. Elevated pCO(2) positively affected growth of F. vesiculosus alone and/or interactively with warming. The response direction (additive, synergistic, or antagonistic), however, depended on season and daylength. The effects were most obvious when plants were actively growing during spring and early summer. Our study revealed for the first time that it is crucial to always consider the impact of variable environmental conditions throughout all seasons. In summary, our study indicates that in future F. vesiculosus will be more affected by detrimental summer heat-waves than by ocean acidification although the latter consequently enhances growth throughout the year.

Variability in winter soil respiration may be influenced by the effects of snowfall on microbial communities and their metabolic activities. In this study, we evaluated the importance of snowpack depth on soil respiration and microbial communities in a temperate deciduous forest. Snow removal created relatively dry, frequently frozen, and carbon substrate-poor soils, while snow additions led to wetter, warmer, and relatively carbon substrate-rich soils. Using time-series multiple regression, we observed enhanced sensitivity of respiration to moisture under ambient snow and snow removal; however, this effect was accompanied by a temporal lag suggesting that microorganisms had a delayed response to increases in free-water during soil thawing events. Conversely, soil respiration was only sensitive to temperature in the snow addition treatment when soil temperatures were consistently above 0 degrees C. The snow-induced respiration dynamics were accompanied by shifts in the structure of wintertime fungal and bacterial communities. We detected an impact of altered snowpack on bacterial richness during the growing season, but our manipulation did not have legacy effects on other features of the soil microbial community at spring thaw. Our results suggest that microbial communities may be reset during seasonal transitions from winter to spring, and that soil microorganisms are likely adapted to annual fluctuations in snowpack depth.. As snowpack becomes more variable in mid-latitude systems due to climate change, our findings suggest that soil moisture and temperature will co-regulate wintertime respiration through a non-linear relationship surrounding soil freeze-thaw cycles, with snow-mediated changes in microbial community structure likely influencing wintertime respiration dynamics.

Water levels in areas with intensive agriculture have often been strictly controlled for decades. Recently, more natural fluctuating water levels have been propagated to improve the ecological quality of wetlands in these areas. This study investigated the effects of water levels on protected base-rich mesotrophic fens during winter and summer. 2. We used a mesocosm approach to simulate water level fluctuations under winter and summer conditions (light and temperature) to test the effects of water level on the biogeochemistry and vegetation of two highly endangered fen types with the brownmosses Scorpidium scorpioides and Hamatocaulis vernicosus as dominant mosses. 3. Both species showed decreased photosynthetic capacity at lower water levels. These levels also resulted in decreased alkalinity due to oxidation processes in the moss layer. High water levels led to increased pH and alkalinity, due to reduction processes and infiltration of base-rich water. 4. For the P-limited S.scorpioides mesocosms, high water levels did not lead to P mobilization or to significant changes in biomass production, P uptake and N:P ratios. However, for the mesocosms with H.vernicosus, where P limitation was not obvious, high water levels did result in P mobilization and increased P availability due to iron reduction. The lower P mobilization for S.scorpioides appeared to be related to lower total soil P content and higher Fe:P and Ca:P ratios. Although high water levels resulted in the accumulation of ammonium under winter conditions, this did not happen under summer conditions, making ammonium toxicity unlikely. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that low water levels could hamper protected brownmosses in rich fens, especially during the summer.

In this study, plants developed at high RH were exposed to daily VPD fluctuations created by changes in temperature and/or RH to evaluate the potential improvements in stomatal functioning. Daily periods with an 11 degrees C temperature increase and consequently a VPD increase (vpd: 0.36-2.37 KPa) reduced the stomatal apertures and improved the stomatal functionality and desiccation tolerance of the rosette plantArabidopsis thaliana. A similar experiment was performed with only a 4 degrees C temperature increase and/or a RH decrease on tomato. The results showed that a daily change in VPD (vpd: 0.36-1.43 KPa) also resulted in improved stomatal responsiveness and decreased water usage during growth.

DO concentrations in cleaned and uncleaned sediments were monitored in situ at 10, 20 and 30 cm sediment depth from the end of November 2001 to the end of April 2002. DO showed only minor fluctuations at the cleaned sites and steadily decreased at all uncleared sites over time. Fine sediment accumulation over 5 months in the cleaned sites was comparable to the proportion of material within the bed prior to the experimental cleaning and probably influenced the DO concentrations of the hyporheic water. Decreasing DO concentrations at all sites coincided with increasing water temperatures towards the end of the study period.

However, information on the effects of key plant traits and phylogenetic relatedness on seed germination is limited at large regional scales that vary in climate. To test the hypotheses that phylogenetic niche conservatism plays a critical force in shaping seed ecophysiological traits across species, and also drives their response to climatic fluctuation, we conducted a controlled experiment on seed germination and determined the percentage and rate of germination for 249 species in subtropical China under two temperature regimes (i.e., daily 25 degrees C; daily alternating 25/15 degrees C for each 12 hr). Germination was low with a skewed distribution (mean = 38.9% at 25 degrees C, and 43.3% at 25/15 degrees C). One fifth of the species had low (<10%) and slow (4-30 days) germination, and only a few (8%) species had a high (>80%) and rapid (1.2-6.6 days) germination. All studied plant traits (including germination responses) showed a significant phylogenetic signal, with an exception of seed germination percentage under the alternating temperature scenario.

This contribution discusses two aspects of protein dynamics, the structural fluctuation and the structural relaxation connected with conformational changes. Myoglobin and haemoglobin were investigated. To cover a wide time range different experimental techniques had to be used. Moreover, measurements in a large temperature regime were used to separate contributions from different modes of motions. Phonon assisted Mossbauer effect using synchrotron radiation allowed the study of the harmonic vibrations which have characteristic times of 1 fs to 0.6 ps. They are present in the whole temperature range from cryogenic to room temperature. With a combination of neutron structure analysis and incoherent neutron scattering it was possible to distinguish three types of hydrogen mean square displacements which are present only above a characteristic temperature T-c: These are the backbone-like (slower than about 100 ps), methyl-like (partly slower partly faster than about 100 ps) and lysine-like (faster than about 100 ps) displacements. The exceptional high energy resolution of Mossbauer absorption on Fe-57 allowed the measurement of quasi diffusive modes of molecular segments which have characteristic times slower than 1 ns and are present only above T-c. Conformational changes from the ligated to the unligated structure of myoglobin and haemoglobin were investigated by creating a metastable intermediate and observing the relaxation into the equilibrium conformation. A metastable state was obtained by X-ray irradiation. Structural relaxation was investigated as a function of time and temperature using the Mossbauer hyperfine interactions as indicator. Furthermore it was possible to measure intermediates created by photolysis of a ligand with temperature dependent X-ray structure analysis or time dependent X-ray structure analysis with the Lane technique. It was shown that the quasi diffusive structural fluctuations above T-c strongly facilitate structural relaxations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For May scallops, performance was better at 6 than at 12 or 18 degrees C whereas September scallops performed better at 6 and 12 degrees C than at 19 degrees C. Regardless of environmental history, the rate of phasic contractions consistently declined at 18-19 degrees C, due to a decrease in the number of phasic contractions. Force measurements during escape responses of May scallops showed that phasic force production and the minimal interval between contractions changed little with temperature, whereas the minimum and mean durations of phasic contractions decreased as temperature rose. Phasic contraction rate in the first series increased with temperature. Reliance upon tonic contractions was higher in scallops tested at 18 degrees C than in those tested at 6 degrees C.

This is the source of water for the upper reaches of Asia's main river systems, providing the livelihood for millions of people in the subregion. Climate change is therefore critical for the Himalaya snow and glacier hydrology, the dependent ecosystems, and the people. Whereas temperature and precipitation are common indicators for climate change, snow and glacier dynamics are reliable precursors of a warming or cooling climate. This study uses a simple empirical climate model (ECM) and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data to analyze water storage dynamics in the 5.072 x 10(6) km(2) Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau region. About 72 consecutive months (January 2003 through December 2008) of data are used in the study. The temperature and precipitation (snow plus rain) data are acquired from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah land surface model and are validated with ground truth data from 205 meteorological stations. Total water storage change derived from the GRACE gravity data is fitted with a simple sinusoidal least squares regression model. A favorable agreement exists between the GRACE and sinusoidal curve (R-2 = 0.81 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 8.73 mm), suggesting that random errors in GRACE data are small. However, the sinusoidal fit does not quantify systematic errors in GRACE data. Agreements between the GRACE- and ECM-estimated storage changes are also favorable at both monthly (R-2 = 0.93, RMSE = 5.46 mm) and seasonal (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 7.64 mm) cycles. The agreements (significant at p < 0.01) indicate not only GRACE's ability to detect storage signal but also that of the ECM model to characterize storage change in the snow and glacier hydrology. There is clear seasonality in the storage anomaly, with the highest in summer and lowest in winter. The corresponding storage change is delayed by a quarter of the year. The GRACE and ECM model indicate an overall negative storage trend of 0.36 +/- 0.03 mm/month or 21.91 +/- 1.95 km(3)/yr for the study area (significant at p < 0.1). Given that snow and glaciers are particularly sensitive to temperature change, the negative storage trend could be indicative of warming climate conditions in the region. Groundwater abstraction (mainly for irrigation) in the southern plains, coupled with dwindling snowfall in the northern massifs, is a critical storage loss factor in the region. Invariably, storage loss in the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau region could have negative implications for the hydrology, dependent ecosystems, and livelihoods of millions of people.",,,,,,"Tao, F/0000-0001-8574-0080",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,JUL 13,2011,47,,,,,,,,W07521,10.1029/2010WR010157,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010WR010157,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000292844300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Several studies have sought to explain this observation. As possible causes, a decrease in acid rain or sulfate deposition, concomitant reductions in ionic strength and increasing temperatures were identified. DOC often originates from riparian wetlands; but here, despite higher DOC concentrations, ionic strength in pore waters usually exceeds that in surface waters. In the catchment under study, DOC concentrations were synchronous with dissolved iron concentrations in pore and stream water. This study aims at testing the hypothesis that DOC exports are mediated by iron reduction/oxidation cycles. Following the observed hydrographs, delta O-18 of water and DOC fluorescence, the wetlands were identified as the main source of DOC. Antecedent biogeochemical conditions, i.e., water table levels in the wetlands, influenced the discharge patterns of nitrate, iron and DOC during an event. The correlation of DOC with pH was positive in pore waters, but negative in surface waters; it was negative for DOC with sulfate in pore waters, but only weak in surface waters. Though, the positive correlation of DOC with iron was universal for pore and surface water. The decline of DOC and iron concentrations in transition from anoxic wetland pore water to oxic stream water suggests a flocculation of DOC with oxidising iron, leading to a drop in pH in the stream during high DOC fluxes. The pore water did not per se differ in pH. There is, thus, a need to consider processes more thoroughly of DOC mobilisation in wetlands when interpreting DOC exports from catchments. The coupling of DOC with iron fluxes suggested that increased DOC exports could at least, in part, be caused by increasing activities in iron reduction, possibly due to increases in temperature, increasing wetness of riparian wetlands, or by a shift from sulfate dominated to iron reduction dominated biogeochemical regimes.",,,,,"Knorr, Klaus-Holger/B-8321-2008","Knorr, Klaus-Holger/0000-0003-4175-0214",,,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2013,10,2,,,,,891,904,,10.5194/bg-10-891-2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-10-891-2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000315093000015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, oxidative stress was created by high irradiance (photo-oxidative stress) and/or carbon depletion. The extent of lipid oxidative damage, antioxidant enzyme activities and the amount of hydrogen peroxide excreted by the algae to the surrounding seawater medium were measured. The results suggest that the two species have different strategies: the annual C. glomerata could be classified as a more stress-tolerant species and the ephemeral E. ahlneriana as a more stress-susceptible species. Low temperature in combination with high irradiance created less lipid oxidative damage in C. glomerata than in E. ahlneriana, which was probably related to the higher regular activities of the hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzymes catalase and ascorbate peroxidase in C glomerata, whereas in E. ahlneriana high activities of these enzymes were only obtained after the induction of oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase activities were similar in both species, but the mechanisms to remove the hydrogen peroxide produced by the action of this enzyme were different: more through scavenging enzymes in C. glomerata and more through excretion to the seawater medium in E ahlneriana. The high excretion of hydrogen peroxide, possibly in combination with brominated volatile halocarbons, by E. ahlneriana may have a negative effect on epiphytes and may partly explain why this alga is usually remarkably devoid of epiphytes and grazers compared to C. glomerata.

Are Influenced by Altering Light, CO2, and Fertility",HORTSCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fuel prices have fluctuated wildly in the last several years, and faced with unpredictable or rising fuel costs, growers often lower temperature set points to decrease fuel use. However, plant growth and development are influenced by lower temperatures and may actually cause increases in fuel use as a result of longer production times. Alternative strategies to efficient crop production are needed. Fertility, light, and CO2 are other environmental factors that can be manipulated within a greenhouse but how all three interact together on growth and development are surprisingly not well known. Petunia xhybrida Vilm. were grown in controlled environments in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial study investigating how light, fertility, and CO2 influence growth and development, including shoot partitioning, nutrient uptake, and carbohydrate concentration. Generally, light enhanced flowering, both mass and fraction of total biomass, whereas increased fertility was detrimental to the proportion of biomass allocated to flowers. The influence of CO2 was complex with high CO2 suppressing flowering and enhancing leaf growth, but only midway through the 7-week experiment. Carbohydrate concentration remained high in elevated CO2, even when light and fertility were not limiting. This suggests a sink limitation, so even in high light and fertility, crop response to enhanced CO2 was low. Although CO2 had no size effect late in growth, CO2 suppressed nutrient concentrations. Together, these data suggest strategies that growers may have in controlling their crop growth and development and indicate that enhanced growth (leaf and steam mass) may be at the detriment of development (flowering mass and allocation).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-5345,,,,,FEB,2011,46,2,,,,,228,235,,10.21273/HORTSCI.46.2.228,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI.46.2.228,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000287336000016,View Full Record in Web of Science

These observations lead naturally to a simple model of the protein-heme system and its thermally induced conformational fluctuations. The model is used to analyze the non-exponential ligand binding, optical line shifts and kinetic holeburning exhibited by (Mb*, CO) at low temperatures. The model makes a specific prediction for the high-temperature Arrhenius barrier at the heme that is found to be in good agreement with kinetic measurements as a function of temperature near 293 K. It is also found that the geminate phase of ligand rebinding remains non-exponential even at these higher temperatures and it is shown that this is due to a homogeneous relaxation process (probably involving changes in the distal pocket protein conformation following photolysis) rather thin to an inhomogeneous distribution of heme rebinding barriers. Slow distal pocket fluctuation time scales are also revealed by using a two-pulse photolysis protocol to select kinetically a rapidly rebinding sub-population of the ensemble.

Thus, it is important to understand the influences of grazing management on grassland ecosystems, which can be monitored by measuring grassland response (e.g. leaf area index [LAI]) to grazing management. However, the measured grassland response includes the impact not only of grazing management, but also of other factors and their interactions, such as climate variability and fire. Therefore, to better study the effects of grazing management, grassland response to grazing needs to be quantified separately from that of other factors which influence grasslands and their interactions. The aim of our research was to quantify these interactions using Landsat thematic mapper (TM) images with long-term datasets at a regional scale. We studied vegetation using a manipulative grazing experiment that applied a range of low to high cattle stocking rates from 2008 to 2011 in a northern native mixed-prairie in Saskatchewan. Results show that precipitation, temperature, interaction between temperature and precipitation, cattle density, interaction between temperature and cattle density, and the interaction among cattle density and climate parameters explained 65.5, 14.5, 9.8, 1.7, 1.4 and 0.5% of the variation in grassland LAI, respectively; thus, precipitation has the dominant effect in mixed-grass prairies, while temperature and the interaction between temperature and precipitation have only moderate effects, and grazing intensity and the interaction between grazing intensity and climate variations have relatively low effects. The results also suggest that grassland response to grazing can be quantitatively separated from that of climate variability with the prior knowledge of grazing intensity, even though the influences of precipitation on LAI overrode the effects of short term grazing.",,,,,,"Xu, Dandan/0000-0002-0033-2262; Koper, Nicola/0000-0003-3576-9525",,,,,,,,,,,,,1744-6961,1744-697X,,,,APR,2018,64,2,,,,,118,127,,10.1111/grs.12192,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/grs.12192,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000429419200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the conditions are favorable for refreezing, little is known about the spatial variability of meltwater refreezing, hindering a complete understanding of seasonal snowmelt dynamics. This study aims to improve our understanding about how refreezing varies in space and time. We simulated refreezing with the seNorge (v2.0) snow model for the Langtang catchment, Nepalese Himalaya, covering a 5-year period. Meteorological forcing data were derived from a unique elaborate network of meteorological stations and high-resolution meteorological simulations. The results show that the annual catchment average refreezing amounts to 122 mm w.e. (21% of the melt), and varies strongly in space depending on elevation and aspect. In addition, there is a seasonal altitudinal variability related to air temperature and snow depth, with most refreezing during the early melt season. Substantial intra-annual variability resulted from fluctuations in snowfall. Daily refreezing simulations decreased by 84% (annual catchment average of 19 mm w.e.) compared to hourly simulations, emphasizing the importance of using sub-daily time steps to capture melt-refreeze cycles.

In Mediterranean-climate areas, depending on the extent of summer droughts and loss of longitudinal connectivity, river segments may become isolated, maintaining fish populations confined to a series of disconnected pools, with no possibility to move to thermal refugia and thus becoming more prone to thermal stress. In this study, we evaluated the effect of a simulated heatwave on the swimming behaviour of juvenile stages of a potamodromous native cyprinid fish, the Iberian barbel Luciobarbus bocagei, under experimental mesocosm conditions. Behavioural traits included fish activity, boldness and shoal cohesion and were continuously measured at a constant flow velocity of 18 cm s(-1), which is typical of riffle habitats. Overall, results show that the behaviour of juvenile Iberian barbel is likely to be affected by heatwaves, with fish displaying lower activity and boldness, while no clear difference was observed in shoal cohesion. This study highlights the importance of managing thermal refugia that are crucial for fish to persist in intermittent rivers. Future studies should focus on the interaction of heatwaves with other stressors, such as oxygen depletion, for a broader understanding of the perturbation affecting freshwater fishes under a changing climate.

The results of present study showed that the adverse effects of OA were more determined by the adverse influence of elevated acidity (H+) on growth rates, calcification, photosynthesis and the related biotic performance of H. opuntia compared with the positive effects that higher CO2 provided. Moreover, diurnal fluctuations in pCO(2) levels [with higher (nearly 8.10) and lower pH (nearly 7.40) values during day and night times, respectively] have amplified these negative influences on H. opuntia. To mitigate elevated pCO(2)-related stress, higher contents of free amino acids and proline were highly secreted and likely linked to protecting the integrity of algal cellular structures.

Remote sensing of evapotranspiration (ET) is an effective way to gain that knowledge: multispectral data can provide synoptic and time-repetitive estimates of crop-specific water use, and could be especially useful for this arid region because of dominantly clear skies and minimal precipitation. Although multiple remote sensing ET approaches have been developed and tested, there is not consensus on which of them should be preferred because there are still few intercomparison studies within this environment. To help build the experience needed to gain consensus, a remote sensing study using three ET models was conducted over the Central Arizona Irrigation and Drainage District (CAIDD). Aggregated ET was assessed for 137 wheat plots (winter/spring crop), 183 cotton plots (summer crop), and 225 alfalfa plots (year-round). The employed models were the Satellite-Based Energy Balance for Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB), and Vegetation Index ET for the US Southwest (VISW). Remote sensing data were principally Landsat 5, supplemented by Landsat 7, MODIS Terra, MODIS Aqua, and ASTER. Using district-wide model averages, seasonal use (excluding surface evaporation) was 742 mm for wheat, 983 mm for cotton, and 1427 mm for alfalfa. All three models produced similar daily ET for wheat, with 6-8 mm/day mid-season. Model estimates diverged for cotton and alfalfa sites. Considering ET over cotton, TSEB estimates were 9.5 mm/day, METRIC 6 mm/day, and VISW 8 mm/day. For alfalfa, the ET values from TSEB were 8.0 mm/day, METRIC 5 mm/day, and VISW 6 mm/day. Lack of local validation information unfortunately made it impossible to rank model performance. However, by averaging results from all of them, ET model outliers could be identified. They ranged from -10% to +18%, values that represent expected ET modeling discrepancies. Relative to the model average, standardized ET-estimators-potential ET (ET), FAO-56 ET, and USDA-SW gravimetric-ET-showed still greater deviations, up to 35% of annual crop water use for summer and year-round crops, suggesting that remote sensing of actual ET could lead to significantly improved estimates of crop water use.

However, these interactions have primarily been explored in single-year, single-factor studies despite the reality of multiple simultaneous global changes. We measured the activity of six enzymes (beta-glucosidase, alpha-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, xylosidase, acid phosphatase, and N-acetylglucosaminidase) for 3 years (2004-2006) following wildfire (2003) at the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment (JRGCE), a long-term multi-factor global change experiment in a California annual grassland. JRGCE manipulations include climate change (elevated temperature and precipitation), nitrogen addition, and elevated CO2. In general we found only minimal interactions among treatments and found the strongest main effects from nitrogen addition and burning. Enzyme activities increased under elevated nitrogen, a response that persisted throughout the 3 years of the study. Wildfire was slightly related to decreased enzyme activities (by 10-20%) in 2004, with a larger decrease (by 25-50%) in 2005. The response was gone by 2006, suggesting that the microbial community was able to recover by 3 years following wildfire. Finally, enzyme responses to treatments, even where statistically significant, were of smaller magnitude than annual variation in activity. We propose that overall decreases in enzyme activity from 2004 to 2006 were due to decreased temperature and increased precipitation in 2005 and 2006 relative to 2004. Our results suggest that while it is important to assess response to specific global change treatment and treatment interactions, these responses (A) may change over time and (B) should be characterized within the context of inter-annual fluctuation in microbial community function.

In this study is assessed the potential impact of atmospheric CO2 enrichment (500 mu mol mol(-1), CE) and canopy warming (+2 degrees C, WA) and their combination (CW) on crop water utilization efficiency (WUE) of winter wheat in an open-air field experiment from Southeast China. Micro-meteorological measurement and wheat growth under individual treatments over three executive years of 2012-2015 were used to estimate the crop water requirement (CWR) of wheat using an improved FAO Penman-Monteith equation. Overall, CO2 enrichment slightly decreased the CWR by 8.3%, and increased the WUE of grain production (WUEg) by 23.1%, averaged over the three years. In contrast, warming increased CWR by 19.6% but decreased WUEg by 27.9% over the period. Under CW treatment, however, CWR was increased by 3.1-15.8% but WUEg was decreased by 3.5-18.2% throughout three years. Clearly, the positive impact of CO2 enrichment on WUE was largely negated under canopy warming. Moreover, when assessing with individual year data, inter-annual variability of WUEg was insignificant under WA, smaller under CE but much higher under CW, compared to CK. These results indicated that an interaction by canopy warming overshadowed the potential increase in WUE with CO2 enrichment and enforced yearly fluctuation of the crop production under simulated climate change conditions. Therefore, improving water supply and management in agriculture should thus be endeavored to address the potential constraints with future trends of concurrent atmospheric CO2 enrichment and warming.

The instrument is a radiometer to measure rotational emission spectra of O-3, CIO, HNO3, and N2O, between 265 and 280 GHz, using a sensitive superconductor-insulator-superconductor detector. Forward and inverse modeling tests have been performed to assess the instrument/inversion system and to determine the sources of the most significant errors in the retrieval of each trace gas. The altitude ranges over which retrievals of concentrations can be made were found to be similar to 13-62 km for O-3, similar to 12.5-39 km for similar to N2O, similar to 12-36 km for HNO3, and similar to 18-46 km for CIO. For each target species the measurement and smoothing errors calculated with an optimal estimation method (OEM) were compared to the errors calculated from inversions of 500 simulated spectra. The absolute error from these inversions agreed well the OEM results, but there were systematic differences that are attributed to nonlinearities in the forward model.

On the other hand, despite its distribution in unstable and highly selective environments such as salt marshes, no data are available on its ecological adaptability or on its growth strategy. In an effort to fill these gaps, we performed three experiments in order to evaluate the effects of selected environmental abiotic factors on the seed germination of A. caerulescens. In the first experiment, we determined the effect of different temperatures, photoperiod regimes and salinity on the germination of 120 days old seeds. Secondly, we tested the germination behaviour of the seeds in relation to seed after-ripening time and salinity. The results showed that a temperature regime of 10/20 degrees C and a photothermoperiod of 12/12 h were optimal conditions for seed germination. Salinity affected the final germination rate and mean time to germination. Until 60 days of after-ripening, the seeds exhibited a primary dormancy state. Then, their germination performance was affected by seed after-ripening time and salinity. The data obtained in this study allow us to outline a fairly accurate picture of the ecological requirements of A. caerulescens during germination and of the degree of viability of its seeds at least in the first year of their life. The significant different susceptibility of the seeds to salinity leads to the conclusion that the spread of this species by seeds strongly depends on soil salinity fluctuations. Knowledge of optimal germination requirements could also be useful for the possible use of plant seeds as propagation material in restoration and biodiversity conservation programmes.",,,,,"Bedini, Stefano/AAF-4453-2020; BERTACCHI, ANDREA/ABF-6078-2021; Lombardi, Tiziana/ABI-5727-2020","Bedini, Stefano/0000-0002-3760-9894; BERTACCHI, ANDREA/0000-0002-3276-3876; Lombardi, Tiziana/0000-0003-0427-1820",,,,,,,,,,,,,1211-9520,1874-9348,,,,JUN,2019,54,1-2,,,,,115,124,,10.1007/s12224-019-09345-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12224-019-09345-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000510731000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Microbial activity is a key regulator of available P through organic matter decomposition (supply) as well as microbial immobilization (depletion). Environmental conditions, such as soil moisture and temperature can fluctuate significantly on hourly to daily time-scales in tropical forested ecosystems. Given the ability of microbes to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions we would expect concomitant changes in the available soil P pool. Despite the potential for soil P availability to vary on short time-scales, research that investigates hourly to daily changes in the available soil P pool in tropical forests is extremely rare. We quantified diurnal fluctuations in labile soil P and the importance of biotic and abiotic factors in driving these patterns in a wet tropical forest in Puerto Rico. Hourly measurements of Bray-extractable P were made from sunrise to sunset on five separate days along with measurements of soil temperature, moisture, pH, soil respiration, and solar radiation. While we found no significant diurnal variation in labile P, it did, however, vary significantly across the five sample days (2.8-3.8 A mu g/g). The day-to-day variation in labile P was positively related to soil moisture (R-2 = 0.42, p = 0.009).

To analyze primary dormancy and effects of after-ripening (dry storage for 28 days) on freshly matured seeds, germination was measured at two fluctuating temperature regimes (15/25degreesC and 5/15degreesC) in the light and in darkness. Temporal changes in dormancy were investigated by burying seeds at 8-10 cm depth in nylon bags, exhuming samples at bimonthly intervals over a period of two years, and analyzing germination at the above-mentioned temperature and light treatments. Additional seed samples were retrieved five years after burial to determine seed longevity and seed-bank type. Freshly matured seeds of all species except Bromus racemosus showed primary dormancy. Dry after-ripening significantly increased germination in Parnassia palustris and Triglochin palustre. Mortality of buried seeds of Bromus racemosus, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Succisa pratensis reached 100% within 12 months (transient seed banks). All other species germinated both in the first and in the second growth period after burial and (with the exception of Briza media) showed annual changes in dormancy. For Silene flos-cuculi and Juncus filiformis, dormancy cycles were detected only in the dark treatments. Most species had a lower percentage germination in darkness than in the light, and the greatest suppression of germination in darkness was found in the small-seeded species (Juncus filiformis and Parnassia palustris). The retrieval of seed samples after five years revealed that most of the fen grassland species examined have short-term, persistent seed banks and thus are buffered against years of poor seed production and/or seedling survival. In addition, a large proportion of the species maintain long-term, persistent seed banks from which re-establishment is possible if management practices and site conditions of degenerated fen grasslands become appropriate following restoration measures.",,,,,"Jensen, Kai/L-6657-2015","Jensen, Kai/0000-0002-0543-070X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0277-5212,,,,,MAR,2004,24,1,,,,,152,166,,10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0152:DPGEAS]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2004)024[0152:DPGEAS]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000220437800014,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, cold treatment (5 degrees C) induces the avoidance response even under weak-light conditions (cold-avoidance response). These three responses are mediated by the phototropin (phot), which is a blue-light photoreceptor and has also been reported to act as a thermosensory protein that perceives temperature variation. Our previous report indicated that cold-induced changes in phot biochemical activity initiate the cold-avoidance response. In this study, we further explored the induction mechanism of the cold-avoidance response in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and examined the relationship between changes in the amount of phot and the induction of the cold-avoidance response. The switch between the accumulation and avoidance responses occurs at a so-called 'transitional' light intensity. Our physiological experiments revealed that a cold-mediated decrease in the transitional light intensity leads to the induction of the cold-avoidance response. While artificial overexpression of phot decreased the transitional light intensity as much as cold treatment did, the amount of endogenous phot was not increased by cold treatment in wild-type M. polymorpha. Taken together, these findings show that the cold-avoidance response is initiated by a cold-mediated reduction of the transitional light intensity, independent of the amount of endogenous phot.

J,"Austin, JA",,,,"Austin, JA",,,The role of the alongshore wind stress in the heat budget of the North Carolina inner shelf,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The heat budget of a cross-shelf section extending 16 km offshore of the outer banks of North Carolina is studied during two time periods: August 1994 and October 1994, using data collected as part of the Coastal Ocean Processes (CoOP) Inner Shelf Study. Heat budgets are computed on tyro different timescales: monthly averages over August and October, which reflect seasonal variations, and a fluctuation budget, which reflects variation on daily to weekly timescales. During August, a period of strong stratification, the increase in the area-averaged water temperature (approximately 3.2 degrees C) was due primarily to the surface heat flux. Fluctuations in temperature during August were caused primarily by the cross-shelf heat flux, due to wind-driven upwelling and downwelling circulation. In October, the area-averaged shelf temperature dropped by approximately 3.5 degrees C due to both surface heat loss and the alongshore transport of heat. Weak vertical stratification in October led to small cross-shelf heat fluxes, and temperature fluctuations in October were due primarily to fluctuations in the surface and alongshore heat fluxes. In both August and October, variation on daily to weekly timescales of the area-averaged temperature of the shelf tvas strongly correlated with the alongshore component of the wind stress. In August, alongshore poleward winds caused upwelling and the area-averaged temperature decreased; conversely, equatorward winds caused downwelling and warming. In October, although the variations in temperature were smaller, alongshore winds were positively correlated with alongshore currents and the surface heat flux (for reasons discussed by Austin and Lentz [this issue]), so that poleward winds resulted in warming; conversely, equatorward winds resulted in cooling. Therefore the dependence of the change in heat content on the alongshore wind stress changed sign between August and October. A simple dynamical model was constructed to relate changes in heat content to the alongshore wind stress. The model results were compared to 12 years of meteorological records from the Coastal Engineering Research Center's Field Research Facility, directly onshore of the experimental site. The results suggest a seasonal cycle in the dominant fluctuating heat balance, consistent with the field results found for August and October 1994. In May through August, cross-shelf flux dominates variation in the heat content. In October through March, the surface heat flux and alongshore heat flux dominate the variation.",,,,,,"Austin, Jay/0000-0002-3580-1794",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,AUG 15,1999,104,C8,,,,,18187,18203,,10.1029/1998JC900122,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1998JC900122,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082043100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given bacteria's short generation time and rapid responses to environmental change, seasonal climate fluctuations are very likely to play an important role in maintaining the extremely high alpha-diversity of soil bacterial community, which has been unfortunately neglected in previous studies. Here, with in-depth analyses of two previously published soil bacterial datasets at global scale, we found that soil bacterial alpha-diversity was positively correlated with both seasonal variations of temperature and precipitation. Furthermore, piecewise structural equation models showed that seasonal variations of temperature or precipitation had weak but significant positive effect on soil bacterial alpha-diversity in each dataset. However, it is noteworthy that the importance of seasonal climate variations might be underestimated in the above analyses, due to the potential confounding factors (such as vegetation type) and the lack of sampling across seasons. As a supplement, we analyzed a previously published wheat cropland dataset with samples collected in both winter and the following summer across North China Plain. As expected, bacterial alpha-diversity was positively correlated with seasonal climate variations in the cropland dataset, and climate seasonality explained a larger proportion of variations in bacterial alpha-diversity. Collectively, these findings implied that fluctuation-dependent mechanisms of diversity maintenance presumably operate in soil bacterial communities. Based on existing evidence, we speculated that the storage effect may be the main mechanism responsible for diversity maintenance in soil bacterial community, but rigorous experimental tests are needed in the future.",,,,,,"Zhao, Xin-Feng/0000-0002-8110-0008",,,,,,,,,,,,,0095-3628,1432-184X,,,,FEB,2022,83,2,,,,,513,517,,10.1007/s00248-021-01780-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01780-1,,MAY 2021,,,,,,34059936,,,,,WOS:000656435000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Biogeomorphology, which considers the interrelations between biological and geomorphological processes, is particularly well-suited toward the understanding of such carbonate systems. Field observations and experimentation on tropical and temperate coasts by both biologists and geomorphologists, and the development of ecological theory, have come to stress the importance not of stable, successional littoral communities but rather of nonequilibrial, multistate systems. These ideas now need to be incorporated into improved models of coastal dynamics. Case studies from the Central Pacific, the Caribbean and the western Indian Ocean illustrate the interactions between external environmental variability and internal biological processes. These studies show how changing the balance between bioconstructional and bioerosional processes can interrupt a system's development and, in some cases, shift carbonate-based systems between healthy and degradational states.

This cost is still well below energy generation costs. However, as the lowest cost energy efficiency measures are adopted, the cost effectiveness of further investment declines. Thus, there is a need to develop large-scale and relatively inexpensive energy auditing techniques to more efficiently find opportunities for savings. Currently, on-site building energy audits process are expensive, in the range of US$0.12/sf - $0.53/sf, and there is an insufficient number of professionals to perform the audits. Here we present research that addresses at community-wide scales the characterization of building envelope thermal characteristics via drive-by and fly-over GPS linked thermal imaging. A central question drives this research: Can single point-in-time thermal images be used to infer R-values and thermal capacitances of walls and roofs? Previous efforts to use thermal images to estimate R-values have been limited to stable exterior weather conditions. The approach posed here is based upon the development of a dynamic model of a building envelope component with unknown R-value and thermal capacitance. The weather conditions prior to the thermal image are used as inputs to the model. The model is solved to determine the exterior surface temperature, ultimately predicted the temperature at the thermal measurement time. The model R-value and thermal capacitance are tuned to force the error between the predicted surface temperature and the measured surface temperature from thermal imaging to be near zero. The results show that this methodology is capable of accurately estimating envelope thermal characteristics over a realistic spectrum of envelope R-values and thermal capacitance present in buildings nationally. With an assumed thermal image accuracy, thermal characteristics are predicted with a maximum error of respectively 20% and 14% for high and low R-values when the standard deviation of outside temperature over the previous 48 hours is as much as 5 degrees C. Experimental validation on a test facility with variable surface materials was attempted under variable weather conditions, e.g., where the outdoor air temperature experiences varying fluctuations prior to imaging. The experimental validation realized errors less than 20% in predicting the R-value even when the standard deviation of outdoor temperature over the 48 hours prior to a measurement was approximately 5 degrees C.",,,,,"Alshatshati, Salahaldin/AAC-9810-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-0-7918-5022-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,,,UNSP V001T11A001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000389094800075,View Full Record in Web of Science

Theoretical calculations are derived for predicting the effects from losses of molecular diffusion, small scale eddies, turbulent kinetic energy, and turbulent mass diffusivity in a scale model, even without Reynolds number matching. Pollutant dispersion experiments were performed in a water-filled 30:1 scale model of a large room, using uranine dye injected continuously from a small point source. Pollutant concentrations were measured in a plane, using laser-induced fluorescence techniques, for three interior configurations: unobstructed, table-like obstructions, and table-like and figure-like obstructions. Concentrations within the measurement plane varied by more than an order of magnitude, even after the concentration field was fully developed. Objects in the model interior had a significant effect on both the concentration field and fluctuation intensity in the measurement plane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0905-6947,,,,,AUG,2004,14,4,,,,,258,271,,10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00242.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00242.x,,,,,,,,15217479,,,,,WOS:000222288600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presented a cooling tower performance model suitable for on-line optimization and established an experimental system to verify the cooling tower model. Based on models of the system components, an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm was proposed to achieve optimization and group control of the water-side free cooling system. The simulation results showed that the fluctuations of the optimal energy consumption and outlet water temperature were 0.66% and 3.34% respectively, demonstrating improved stability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm compared with the conventional algorithm. The results revealed that the optimal outlet water temperature of the cooling tower varied minimally with the cooling load and was approximately linearly proportional to the outdoor wet bulb temperature. The optimal gas-water mass ratios were found to be inversely correlated to the wet-bulb temperature and cooling load.

Microbial responses to repeated freeze-thaw conditions were studied in three complementary experiments using arctic sediment collected from an intertidal flat that is exposed to seasonal freeze-thaw conditions (Ymerbukta, Svalbard, Arctic Ocean). The sediment was subjected to oscillating freeze-thaw incubations, either gradual, from -5 to 4 degrees C, or abrupt, from -20 to 10 degrees C. Concentrations of low-molecular weight carboxylic acids (volatile fatty acids) were measured and sulfate reduction was assessed by measuring S-35 sulfate reduction rates (SRRs). Gradual freeze-thaw incubation decreased microbial activity in the frozen state to 0.25 % of initial levels at 4 degrees C, but activity resumed rapidly reaching >60 % of initial activity in the thawed state. Exposure of sediments to successive large temperature changes (-20 versus 10 degrees C) decreased SRR by 80% of the initial activity, suggesting that a fraction of the bacterial community recovered rapidly from extreme temperature fluctuations. This is supported by 16S rRNA gene-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles that revealed persistence of the dominant microbial taxa under repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The fast recovery of the SRRs suggests that carbon mineralization in thawing arctic sediment can resume without delay or substantial growth of microbial populations.

For instance, fluctuations can directly increase the risk of invasions of alien species into new areas, as these species have repeatedly been proposed to benefit from disturbances. At the same time increased environmental fluctuations may also select for better invaders. However, selection by fluctuations may also influence the resistance of communities to invasions, which has rarely been tested. We tested eco-evolutionary dynamics of invasion with bacterial clones, evolved either in constant or fluctuating temperatures, and conducted experimental invasions in both conditions.ResultsWe found clear evidence that ecological fluctuations, as well as adaptation to fluctuations by both the invader and community, all affected invasions, but played different roles at different stages of invasion. Ecological fluctuations clearly promoted invasions, especially into fluctuation mal-adapted communities. The evolutionary background of the invader played a smaller role.ConclusionsOur results indicate that climate change associated disturbances can directly increase the risk of invasions by altering ecological conditions during invasions, as well as via the evolution of both the invader and communities. Our experiment provides novel information on the complex consequences of climate change on invasions in general, and also charts risk factors associated with the spread of environmentally growing opportunistic pathogens.",,,,,"Ketola, Tarmo/AAD-2609-2019; Lindstrom, Leena/B-2326-2012","Ketola, Tarmo/0000-0001-5151-7980; Lindstrom, Leena/0000-0002-6452-4538",,,,,,,,,,,,,1471-2148,,,,,FEB 1,2019,19,,,,,,,,42,10.1186/s12862-019-1348-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-019-1348-9,,,,,,,,30709335,,,,,WOS:000457372000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The coral Diploria labyrinthiformis has been shown to be more disease resistant than its relative Pseudodiploria strigosa, providing an ideal study system for disease resistance. In this study, we examined the bacterial communities of these 2 coral species on the Florida Reef tract every 6 mo for 18 mo (in situ sampling), and under experimental (laboratory) thermal and pH manipulation. The in situ sampling encompassed wide fluctuations in temperature, including an anomalously warm summer period. The laboratory experiments involved exposure to both increased temperature (31 degrees C) and lowered pH (7.7). The in situ bacterial communities of both coral species were highly similar in the winter, but diverged during summer, with the D. labyrinthiformis bacterial community being more stable than that of P. strigosa. Differences in the bacterial community between the 2 coral species included 29 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were specific to D. labyrinthiformis in all seasons, while only 2 OTUs were specific to P. strigosa.

We measured recovery of predators on lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus L.) that were infested with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. Factors thought to affect movement and colonization were distance to a receiver unit from a release (landing) point, intervening soil surfaces such as clods, gravel, fine soil and grass, and management of soil surfaces such as mulching, watering or both. In the field, the effect of distance (0.11-1.76 m) from a landing point to a receiver unit was significant, with a negative log-linear relationship. Soil surfaces such as clods and management actions such as watering with mulching allowed for more capture of predators on bean plants with prey than did other treatments. Environmental conditions greatly affected survival of N. fallacis. Predators in the field that were present on bare soil suffered high mortality (ca. 90%) at fluctuating daytime conditions of 26.4 +/- 4.8 degreesC and 56 +/- 13.4% RH.

This study aimed to examine the effect of moderate alternating temperatures on breaking the physical dormancy of seeds, the morphoanatomy and histochemistry of seed coats, and to locate the structure/region responsible for water entrance into the seed, after breaking the physical dormancy of seeds of two woody Fabaceae (subfamily Faboideae) species that occur in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest: Sophora tomentosa and Erythrina speciosa. To assess temperature effect, seeds were incubated in several temperature values that occur in the Atlantic Forest. For morphological and histochemical studies, sections of fixed seeds were subjected to different reagents, and were observed using light or epifiuorescence microscopy, to analyze the anatomy and histochemistry of the seed coat. Treated and non-treated seeds were also analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to observe the morphology of the seed coat. To localize the specific site of water entrance, the seeds were blocked with glue in different regions and also immersed in ink. In the present work a maximum temperature fluctuation of 15 degrees C was applied during a period of 20 days and these conditions did not increase the germination of S. tomentosa or E. speciosa. These results may indicate that these seeds require larger fluctuation of temperature than the applied or/and longer period of exposition to the temperature fluctuation. Blocking experiments water inlet combined with SEM analysis of the structures of seed coat for both species showed that besides the lens, the hilum and micropyle are involved in water absorption in seeds scarified with hot water. In seeds of E. speciosa the immersion of scarified seeds into an aniline aqueous solution showed that the solution first entered the seed through the hilum.

Using a regional ice-ocean coupled model with a simple biogeochemical cycle, this study investigated the mechanisms controlling interannual-decadal variations in surface PO4 in the Oyashio region and their relationships to climate change. Hindcast experiments forced with atmospheric reanalysis data for 1980-2010 and 18.6-year tidal mixing strength in the Kuril Straits qualitatively simulated interannual-decadal variations of surface PO4, including a realistic seasonal cycle. Interannual fluctuations of simulated PO4 in the Oyashio region are prominent in winter and characterized by year-to-year variability. Budget analysis of PO4 in the mixed layer showed that the wintertime increase in PO4 is caused by lateral advection as well as by local vertical convection. The geostrophic current variability responsible for lateral advection of PO4 is related primarily to the barotropic response of arrested topographic waves in the Sea of Okhotsk as well as the wind-driven gyre in the North Pacific, both of which are regulated by the strength of the wintertime monsoon atmospheric pattern. On a decadal timescale (>7 years), temporal variations of surface PO4 in the Oyashio region are characterized by decadal-scale fluctuation with positive (negative) peaks around 1985, 1995, and 2005 (1990 and 2000). A series of sensitivity experiments demonstrated that the decadal variability of PO4 is largely explained by atmospheric wind conditions; however, modulation by 18.6-year tidal mixing is not negligible. Diagnostic analysis of wind-forced-experiment data revealed that the decadal PO4 signal is advected from the Sea of Okhotsk, where 8-year leading wintertime Ekman upwelling supplies PO4-rich water in the northern shelf region, and that the responsible atmospheric circulation is related to the West Pacific pattern. Our model simulation suggests that the wintertime wind-driven current system in the Sea of Okhotsk is important to the system feeding surface nutrients into the Oyashio region on an interannual-decadal timescale.",,,,,"Nishioka, Jun/F-5314-2011","Nishioka, Jun/0000-0003-1723-9344",,,,,,,,,,,,,0079-6611,1873-4472,,,,SEP-OCT,2021,197,,,,,,,,102615,10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102615,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102615,,JUL 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000709144500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Vertical profiles of air temperature and vapour pressure, leaf temperature measurements in the understorey, as well as assumptions regarding surface temperature of pine needles allow the computation of mean surface conductances of the tree canopy and understorey. In our experimental conditions, these conductances can be described fairly well by a linear function of the ratio of the net radiation absorbed by the layer on the air saturation deficit at its level (R(n)/D). This leads to a simple relationship between surface conductance and the ratio LE/R(n) (LE is the latent heat flux of each layer). The variations of daily LE/Rn values for pines seem to be related to the amount of water stored in the ground (0-75 cm). However, when drought is established, evapotranspiration increases after rainfalls, even if they do not obviously affect overall water storage. For the understorey, LE/R(n) remains at high levels throughout the experiment, possibly due to the low climatic demand, as understorey net radiation is rather low.",,,,,,"Loustau, Denis/0000-0003-3990-400X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-4312,,,,,,1991,48,2,,,,,157,177,,10.1051/forest:19910204,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/forest:19910204,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991FJ96700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, a model for Evaporation and Drainage investigations at Ground of Ordinary Rainfed-areas (hereafter E-DiGOR) is presented. Daily potential evaporation (E-p) from bare soils was calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation with a surface resistance of zero. Actual soil evaporation (E,,) was computed according to Aydin et al. [Aydin, M., Yang, S.L., Kurt, N., Yano, T., 2005. Test of a simple model for estimating evaporation from bare soils in different environments. Ecol. Model. 182 (1), 91-105; Aydin, M., Yano, T, Evrendilek, F., Uygur, V, 2008. Implications of climate change for evaporation from bare soils in a Mediterranean environment. Environ. Monit. Assess. 140,123-130]. Deep drainage (D) was simply calculated by the mass balance, taking field capacity into account. In order to test the performance of the model mainly for drainage estimations, a micro-lysimer experiment was carried out under field conditions. The experimental terrain was nearly flat, with no appreciable slope. Estimated and measured water balance components such as actual evaporation (R-2 = 91.4%; P < 0.01.), drainage (R-2 = 88.5%; P < 0.01) and soil water storage (R-2 = 89.7%; P < 0.01) were in agreement. This agreement supported the model hypothesis, thus rendering the model useful in estimating soil evaporation, drainage and water storage in an interactive way with a few parameters. Once the estimated and measured data from the experiment had been compared for validation, simulations were carried out continuously for the period of 1994-2006 in a semi-arid environment of Turkey. Ep rates were lower during the winter season because of the lesser evaporative demand of the atmosphere. However, Ea rates were mainly found to be functions of the rainfall pattern, and presumably soil wetness in addition to atmospheric evaporative demand. D volumes below 120 cm soil depth were high during rainy months, with a peak in January. Annual E-P varied between 850.6 and 909.8 mm during the period of 13 years. E. ranged from 248.0 to 392.9 mm with a mean annual value of 302.5 mm.

Thus, germination and seedling establishment are essential processes in the life history of these plants, as they determine their distribution, survival, and abundance. Few studies have examined germination and early seedling development of the Mexican species of this family. In this paper, we experimentally evaluated the influence of light quality (white, red, far red, and darkness), storage time (three months, six months, and 10 years) and temperature (constant 25 degrees C and alternate 15-25 degrees C) on Noveloa coulteriana germination. Seeds were positive photoblastic, and showed high germination capacity in white and red light treatments (>80%). In contrast to previously studied Mexican podostemads, N. coulteriana seeds are recalcitrant. Seeds were also thermoblastic; germination rate was slower in alternate temperature compared to constant temperature. Additionally, using electron microscopy, we observed ex situ seedling development during one month (until its senescence). Micromorphologically, N. coulteriana seedlings showed the characteristic developmental pattern of the subfamily Podostemoideae, where the embryonic shoot and root meristems are lost.

A laboratory rearing method was developed using Lygus lineolaris as the host to enhance establishment efforts and provide large numbers of wasps for inundative releases into high value fruit crops. Experiments were conducted to determine optimum host:parasitoid density and rearing temperature. The effects of nymph:wasp ratios and temperature on parasitism and wasp survival showed a 20:1 ratio at 20 degrees C provided high parasitism (256 parasitized nymphs/wasp over lifetime) and excellent wasp survival of 27 days. Experiments on diapause-inducing conditions for P. digoneutis demonstrated that fluctuating temperatures of 23 degrees C (day) and 16 degrees C (night) and corresponding photo phases of 16 h light, for rearing parasitized nymphs, produced 100% diapausing parasitoids whereas non-diapausing parasitoids were only produced at more than 16 h light. Furthermore, parasitized Lygus nymphs need to be transferred to short day conditions no later than 10 days after parasitism to produce diapausing parasitoids. Critical life stages for exposure to conditions inducing diapause, the egg, first and second instar parasitoid larva, occurred from 0 to 10 days at 24 degrees C constant temperature. Increased time in cold storage reduced the number of days to first emergence of parasitoids from diapausing cocoons when transferred to warm temperatures. The optimum storage time for diapausing P. digoneutis is between 25 and 44 weeks, depending upon the length of time that cocoons remain at warm conditions prior to chilling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0958-3157,1360-0478,,,,,2010,20,9,,,,,923,937,PII 922418851,10.1080/09583157.2010.492209,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2010.492209,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000279443400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Premature deacclimation and the inability to reacclimate could result in crown damage from spring freeze-thaw cycles. A field experiment was conducted, replicated over 2 years, to determine how three cultivars with varying adaptation to southern Ontario deacclimate in the spring by assessing LT50 (the temperature at which 50% of plants die) and biochemical and physiological parameters associated with freezing tolerance. 'UC 157' (UC), the least-adapted cultivar, deacclimated after soil temperatures rose above freezing; LT50 values increased linearly over time and were unaffected by fluctuations in soil temperature. 'Jersey Giant' (JG), a cultivar with moderate adaptation, rapidly deacclimated with increased soil temperature but appeared to partially reacclimate as temperatures decreased. For 'Guelph Millennium' (GM), the most-adapted cultivar, LT50 values did not change, maintaining the greatest levels of freezing tolerance during the spring sampling period. Although LT50 values did not differ among cultivars on the first spring sampling date, ranking for freezing tolerance at the final sampling in each year was GM>JG>UC, which is consistent with adaptation. Rhizome traits were most associated with freezing tolerance and included high concentrations of low-molecular weight fructans (LFs), glucose, and proline and low percentage water and sucrose concentration. Overall, data suggest that the timing of deacclimation and loss of freezing tolerance in the spring may significantly affect winterhardiness; cultivars that lose freezing tolerance early and cannot reacclimate could suffer most from late spring freeze-thaw cycles.",,,,,"Campos, Gustavo R C Ribeiro/O-3981-2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1062,2327-9788,,,,JAN,2016,141,1,,,,,22,33,,10.21273/JASHS.141.1.22,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS.141.1.22,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369467100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Also, complex reactions and processes need not have a single 'energy of activation' and their 'kinetic order' is not always clearly defined. Thus, the progress of such a reaction or process is governed by time dependent kinetics whose description requires a departure from the traditional models, which are based on an analogy to simple chemical reactions. A general model that takes these considerations into account is demonstrated with simulated biochemical reactions under monotonic temperature increase and decrease and under regular and irregular temperature fluctuations. Its potential application to microbial growth and growth followed by decay is also demonstrated. The model is in the form of a cumbersome differential equation, which, nevertheless, can be solved by standard mathematical software. In certain cases, the same software can also be used to determine the process's basic kinetic parameters, and their temperature dependence, from experimental data obtained under non-isothermal conditions.

The relative AA (AA(rel)) in percent, which was normalized from the initial AA value, was plotted against the accumulated amount of CO2 production (AR(CO2)). AA(rel) decreased with increasing AR(CO2) in each experiment. The relationship between AA(rel) and AR(CO2) of broccoli can be expressed by a single equation with a common parameter (beta), regardless of storage and produce variations, suggesting that decreasing AA content could be deduced from respiratory activity. Subsequently, the feasibility of applying the published respiration data to this equation to predict AA change during actual distribution processes was investigated. Cut broccoli was stored under fluctuating temperature conditions and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). We calculated the change in AA values under these conditions using our proposed equation substituted in the Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten models. Predicted values had good agreement with measured values. This finding suggests a new application of the respiration model for quality prediction.

Due to great temperature fluctuation in hot arid and semi-arid region of Rajasthan, this area could serve as a good source for new thermophilic lipase producing bacteria with novel industrially important properties. The main objective of this research is the isolation and estimation of industrially important thermophilic lipase enzyme produced by thermophilic bacteria, isolated from arid and semi-arid region of Rajasthan. For this research purpose soil samples were collected from Churu, Sikar and Jhunjunu regions of Rajasthan. Total 16 bacterial strains were isolated and among only 2 thermostable lipolytic enzyme producing bacteria were charcterized. The thermostable lipolytic enzyme was estimated by qualitative and quantitative experiments. The isolates were identified as Bacillus sp. by microscopic, biochemical and molecular characterization. The optimum enzyme activity was observed at pH 8, temperature 60 degrees C and 6% salt concentrations at 24 hrs time duration. Lipolytic enzyme find useful in a variety of biotechnological fields such as food and dairy (cheese ripening, flavour development), detergent, pharmaceutical (naproxen, ibuprofen), agrochemical (insecticide, pesticide) and oleochemical (fat and oil hydrolysis, biosurfactant synthesis) industries. Lipolytic enzyme can be further used in many newer areas where they can serve as potential biocatalysts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1338-5178,,,,,OCT-NOV,2012,2,2,,,,,619,633,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000458067000020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, there are still large uncertainties of processes controlling plant carbon investment into BVOCs, of some biosynthetic pathways and their linkage to CO2 decarboxylation at central metabolic branching points. To shed more light on carbon partitioning during BVOC biosynthesis, we used an innovative approach combining delta(CO2)-C-13 laser spectroscopy, high-sensitivity proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry and a multiple branch enclosure system in combination with position-specific C-13-metabolite labelling. Feeding experiments with position-specific C-13-labelled pyruvate, a central metabolite of BVOC synthesis, enabled online detection of carbon partitioning into C-13-BVOCs and respiratory (CO2)-C-13. Measurements of trace gas emissions of the Mediterranean shrub Halimium halimifolium revealed a broad range of emitted BVOCs. In general, [2-13C]-PYR was rapidly incorporated into emitted acetic acid, methyl acetate, toluene, cresol, trimethylbenzene, ethylphenol, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, indicating de novo BVOC biosynthesis of these compounds. In contrast, [1-13C]-pyruvate labelling substantially increased (CO2)-C-13 emissions in the light indicating C1-decarboxylation. Similar labelling patterns of methyl acetate and acetic acid suggested tightly connected biosynthetic pathways and, furthermore, there were hints of possible biosynthesis of benzenoids via the MEP-pathway. Overall, substantial CO2 emission from metabolic branching points during de novo BVOC biosynthesis indicated that decarboxylation of [1-13C]-pyruvate, as a non-mitochondrial source of CO2, seems to contribute considerably to daytime CO2 release from leaves. Our approach, combining synchronised BVOC and CO2 measurements in combination with position-specific labelling opens the door for real-time analysis tracing metabolic pathways and carbon turnover under different environmental conditions, which may enhance our understanding of regulatory mechanisms in plant carbon metabolism and BVOC biosynthesis.",,,,,"Werner, Christiane/AAO-9976-2021; Werner, Christiane/B-2948-2009; yañez serrano, ana/Z-6147-2019","Werner, Christiane/0000-0002-7676-9057; Werner, Christiane/0000-0002-7676-9057; yañez serrano, ana/0000-0001-6408-5961",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,SEP 25,2018,13,9,,,,,,,e0204398,10.1371/journal.pone.0204398,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204398,,,,,,,,30252899,,,,,WOS:000445639700049,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate and soil conditions were therefore the same for all the trees studied. The experimental site was chosen to be representative of the south-exposed sites in the Romanian Carpathian Mountains, where pine occurs naturally. In order to investigate the consequences of fluctuations in climate at different temporal scales, we examined both inter-annual and decadal time-steps. An index of soil water deficit was computed to investigate the consequences of drought. Our study reveals that species exhibited different responses to precipitation, temperature or drought. Overall, pine was the most sensitive to precipitation, while spruce showed a higher response to temperature at high frequency for both the current and the previous growing seasons, and to soil water deficit. Fir was the least sensitive species of the comparison. However, for all species, decadal modulations of growth show precipitation as a common and strong driver on the dry south-facing slopes.

The objectives of this work were to evaluate the effect of temperature, red (R):far-red (FR) ratio and the possible role of the caryopses covering structures on the release of seed dormancy in D. sanguinalis. Therefore, the effects of moist pre-treatment duration, light and temperature, as well as the caryopsis covering structures, and imbibition with H2O2 and the extract of caryopses covers on seed germination, were investigated. Moist pre-treatment at 5 and 20 C-omicron promoted dormancy release and fluctuating temperatures between 20/30 C-omicron and light promoted germination. However, exposure to 30 min of light with a high R:FR ratio reduced germination. Removing or puncturing some of the caryopsis covering structures, as well as imbibition with 2.6 M H2O2 enhanced seed germination. Results suggest that the extended seedling emergence throughout the season could be due to the influence of the environmental factors studied here on dormancy release and germination, and that seed covering structures have an important role in seed dormancy imposition for this species.

We exposed eight grass species to a simulated heat wave in the field ('free air' temperature increase at 11 degrees C above ambient) combined with drought. We determined whether interspecific differences in survival time were related to the responses of the species to the imposed stress or could be explained by their ecophysiological or morphological characteristics in unstressed conditions. Surprisingly, there was no effect of specific leaf area, but species with a higher total leaf area survived longer. This may arise from a greater water reserve in the plant as a whole, which could delay the desiccation of the meristem, or from reduced evaporation due to a higher leaf area index. Species in which the decrease in light-saturated stomatal conductance (g(s)) and photosynthetic CO(2) uptake rate (A(max)) was strongly related to the decrease in soil water availability (measured as soil relative water content and stress duration) survived longer than species in which g(s) and A(max) likewise declined but responded more to daily fluctuations in irradiance, temperature, and vapor pressure deficit during the heat wave. We, therefore, hypothesize that interspecific differences in stress survival time might be related to the extent to which stomata react to changes in soil water conditions relatively to changes in other environmental and physiological factors.

Experiments were conducted in a full-scale chamber with four different kinds of ventilation systems: ceiling supply and side return (CS), ceiling supply and ceiling return (CC), side supply and ceiling return (SC), and side supply and side return (SS).

The selection processes for FFT filtering and wavelet transform, FFT filter cut-off frequency, wavelet function, and decomposition layers are also discussed, as well as the threshold for wavelet denoising, which can be adjusted accordingly if the walking frequency or sampling frequency differs from that in other studies. The results show that for the flow and pollutant fields, the use of a ventilation system can increase the range scale robustness by 19.7%-39.4% and 10.0%-38.8%, respectively; and the SS system was 7.0%-25.7% more robust than the other three ventilation systems.

Heat and salt budgets calculated in the upper ocean indicate local balance between surface forcing and the ocean response. Thus the mixed-layer model captures the dominant processes governing heat and salt variability. The model responses are analyzed and compared with the observed upper ocean in three distinctive layers determined by Monin-Obukhov length scales. In the top layer (the top 5 m), about 90% of the surface buoyancy flux is absorbed, and strong diurnal and intraseasonal variations are excited. The second layer, 5-20 m, contains intraseasonal variability that is characterized by nearly neutral stratification during strong westerly wind events, strong thermal stratification during clear-sky days, and strong saline stratification during heavy precipitation. The dominant effect of precipitation is to generate a stable stratification and to form a barrier layer. The third layer, 20-50 m, has intraseasonal variations due to mixing during westerly wind events. Heavy precipitation amplifies mixed-layer temperature fluctuations by a cycle of strong surface cooling and entrainment warming through the following processes. Heavy precipitation causes a shallower mixed layer and a larger cooling rate. Surface temperature drops rapidly, and the upper ocean becomes thermally unstable. The salinity maintains a-weak density stability, which causes strong entrainment warming. Surface freshwater flux is the key factor controlling saline structure when advection is excluded. However, experiments without the entrainment process show a significant bias toward a lower salinity, indicating that the entrainment process must be properly treated in the model to prevent a biased trend.",,,,,"Li, Xiaofan/F-5605-2010; Li, Xiaofan/G-2094-2014","SUI, CHUNG-HSIUNG/0000-0003-2842-5660; SUI, CHUNG-HSIUNG/0000-0001-5524-174X",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 15,1998,103,C3,,,,,5347,5359,,10.1029/97JC03420,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97JC03420,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000072525300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

While relevant for lentic ecosystems, pulsed patterns of salinity occur in lotic environments, particularly in summer months where precipitation can decrease elevated salinity levels caused by retention of residual salts. The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of pulsed patterns of salinity on the emergence, sex ratio, and fecundity of Chironomus dilutus over two generations of laboratory exposure. Three road de-icing salt treatments, including a control, modeled after environmental monitoring data of two local streams, were used to determine the ecological effects of periodic declines in salinity on C. dilutus at summer temperatures. No significant effects were observed on emergence success or sex ratios within or across generations, but fecundity of C. dilutus in the high salt treatment was reduced regardless of generation (P < 2e-16), possibly due to increased osmoregulatory stress caused by increased salinities. The intermediate and decreasing salinities may account for the lack of negative effects on emergence success and sex ratios by protecting sensitive life stages. More research is needed on long-term effects of reduced fecundity on population viability. The current study suggests more research using a similar experimental design is needed to fully evaluate the influence of road de-icing salts in lotic environments, as static laboratory exposures may not accurately reflect environmental changes in salinity.",,,,,,"Dobry, Emily/0000-0002-0164-804X; Nutile, Samuel/0000-0002-9274-1564",,,,,,,,,,,,,0963-9292,1573-3017,,,,MAR,2021,30,2,,,,,224,230,,10.1007/s10646-020-02338-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-020-02338-6,,JAN 2021,,,,,,33474703,,,,,WOS:000609053600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper describes an alternative approach, in which process studies are based on scaled centrifuge modelling of thawing ice-rich soils. Centrifuge scaling laws allow similitude in self-weight stresses between the model scale and the prototype (field) scale to be achieved. In these experiments, 120- to 130-mm-thick frozen models comprising a sand unit overlying ice-rich kaolinite clay (three models) or ice-rich silt (one model) were thawed under an acceleration of 20 gravities. The models were therefore equivalent to 2.4-2.6 m of frozen sediments (permafrost) at the prototype scale. Temperature profiles and porewater pressures during the thawing of each model are described. Porewater pressures significantly in excess of hydrostatic were not observed in the sand/silt model. In the sand/clay models, however, excess pressures developed rapidly after thawing, and observed fluctuations in pressure were interpreted as water-escape events. After thawing, careful sectioning of the models revealed small-scale deformation structures at the clay-sand interface, resulting from loading of the upper sand layer into very soft fluid-like clay and injection of clay upwards into the base of the sand. It is concluded that these experiments provide analogues for some Pleistocene involutions. Such involutions therefore mark phases of permafrost degradation when high porewater pressures caused loading and injection along sedimentary boundaries.",,,,,"Davies, Michael/GWV-2527-2022; Davies, Michael C R/H-3269-2014","Davies, Michael C R/0000-0002-0036-8708; Murton, Julian/0000-0002-9469-5856",,,,,,,,,,,,,0037-0746,,,,,JUN,2000,47,3,,,,,687,700,,10.1046/j.1365-3091.2000.00322.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3091.2000.00322.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000087496200011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among, the carabid species Abaris basistriatus stood out for having been characterized as dominant in crop and forest fragment of the two experimental areas. The species Scarites sp. 4 and A. basistriatus generally presented population peaks when the crop soybean counted less than 30 days of the implantation, the other species presented population peaks that were observed in varied times of the crops.

Here, we report the effects of soil freezing on interannual variation in stream chemistry at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Data from 1970 to 1997 of soil frost depth, snow cover, precipitation, air temperature, and stream discharge and chemistry were used in a stepwise linear regression model to select the variables that best predicted deviations of annual stream concentrations from 4-year running averages. Variables quantifying soil freezing severity were selected as significant predictors of short-term fluctuations in stream K+, NO3-, Ca2+, and Mg2+ concentrations from 1970 to 1989, explaining 59 and 47% of the short-term variability in K+ and NO3, respectively. Fine-root mortality and disturbance of root-soil-mic robe interactions, with subsequent effects on decomposition and nutrient uptake, likely contributed to the mobilization of K+ and NO3- to streamwater following severe soil freezing events. The relationship between soil freezing and stream chemistry, however, weakened during the period 1990-1997. Because soil freezing has had inconsistent effects on stream chemistry during the period 1970-1997, it is unclear whether future changes in the frequency, duration, and depth of soil freezing events as the result of changes in the snow cover regime under a warmer climate will have significant impacts on the losses of NO3 and nutrient-base cations from temperate northern ecosystems.",,,,,"Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014","Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890; Groffman, Peter/0000-0001-8371-6255",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-936X,,,,,APR 15,2003,37,8,,,,,1575,1580,,10.1021/es026189r,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es026189r,,,,,,,,12731840,,,,,WOS:000182223700015,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper investigates the combined effects of both factors with two temperature regimes (constant temperature = 26 degrees C, CTE vs. daily thermocycle = 28 degrees C day:24 degrees C night, TC) and three light wavelengths (white-W, blue-B, red-R) on Danio rerio embryos and larvae from fertilization to 30 days post-fertilization (dpf). It studied hatching rate, larval survival, growth, and food intake (gut content). It analyzed the expression of the genes involved in stress (crh), somatic growth (gh, ifg1a, igf2a), and food intake control (npy, agrp, ghrelin, orexin, mch1, mch2, grp, cck8) at 10 and 30 dpf. The results revealed that the lowest hatching rate was in R regardless of the temperature regime. The highest growth rate was for the larvae reared with B + TC, which was consistent with the highest expression values of the growth factors. The highest feeding and expression levels of the genes involved in food intake were for the larvae in B (regardless of the temperature regime) and W + TC. Conversely, the R + CTE combination obtained the worst growth and feeding results.

All shellfish used were juveniles with shell heights of 10-25 mm. The design was duplicated for control and experimental systems with a combined population of 1600 individual shellfish. The maximum biomass in each system was estimated at < 1 kg/m(3). Each system included six, 400 litre rectangular fibreglass tanks, a modular pump and filter unit (particle and activated carbon filters and ultra-violet sterilisers), a biological filter and a refrigeration unit. The total volume of water for each system was 2300 litres of artificial seawater (Instant Ocean (R)). The mean water temperature of 22 degrees C was achieved by thermostat-controlled room temperature. Salinity was maintained between 27 and 31 parts per thousand by addition of either freshwater or artificial seawater. Shellfish were fed daily a mixed diet of carboy-cultured algae and spray-dried algae.

H.",,,Linking Ocean Forcing and Atmospheric Interactions to Atlantic Multidecadal Variability in MPI-ESM1.2,GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,,,,,,,,,,,,"We investigate how ocean-driven multidecadal sea surface temperature (SST) variations force the atmosphere to jointly set the pace of Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV). We generate periodic low-frequency Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation oscillations by implementing time-dependent deep-ocean-density restoring in MPI-ESM1.2 to explicitly identify variations driven by Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation without any perturbation at the ocean-atmosphere interface. We show in a coupled experiment that ocean heat convergence variations generate positive SST anomalies, turbulent heat release, and low sea level pressure in the subpolar North Atlantic (NA) and vice versa. The SST signal is communicated to the tropical NA by wind-evaporative-SST feedbacks and to the North-East Atlantic by enhanced northward atmospheric heat transport. Such atmospheric feedbacks and the characteristic AMV-SST pattern are synchronized to the multidecadal time scale of ocean circulation changes by air-sea heat exchange. This coupled ocean-atmosphere mechanism is consistent with observed features of AMV and thus supports a key role of ocean dynamics in driving the AMV. Plain Language Summary The Atlantic multidecadal variability is an observed fluctuation of North Atlantic ocean surface temperatures on multidecadal time scales. It strongly influences climatic conditions over the surrounding continents in the North Atlantic region as well as in remote areas. Therefore, it is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms, particularly in regard to predict the Atlantic multidecadal variability itself and its impacts. However, the respective contributions from fast atmospheric forcing and slow ocean variations to such long-term climate variations have been controversially discussed. Here, by artificially increasing the variability of ocean dynamics in a climate model, we improve the mechanistic understanding of the role of ocean dynamics in driving the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability. We believe our results suggest a major role for ocean dynamics. A climate model reacts to an increase in ocean circulation by accumulating heat in the subpolar North Atlantic. Associated atmospheric responses to ocean forcing contribute to heat redistribution to form the basin-wide sea surface temperature pattern of Atlantic Multidecadal Variability. None of these fundamental imprints of ocean dynamics can be reproduced by a model experiment that excludes ocean dynamics (slab-ocean model). Our results therefore substantiate Atlantic multidecadal variability as a coupled mode of ocean-atmospheric variability, which strongly relies on the slow circulation variations of the ocean.",,,,,"Borchert, Leonard/Y-2057-2019","Borchert, Leonard/0000-0002-3232-7409; Oelsmann, Julius/0000-0003-3950-0881; Hand, Ralf/0000-0003-4169-5016",,,,,,,,,,,,,0094-8276,1944-8007,,,,MAY 28,2020,47,10,,,,,,,e2020GL087259,10.1029/2020GL087259,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087259,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000560371700031,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is paramount to develop heat tolerant wheat cultivars able to sustain under high and fluctuating temperature conditions. An experiment was conducted to characterize 194 historical wheat cultivars of Pakistan under high temperature at seedling stage to identify loci associated with heat tolerance using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A quantitative trait locus, TaHST1, on chr4A was also characterized to identify the haplotypes at this locus associated with heat tolerance in wheat from Pakistan. Initially, the diversity panel was planted under control conditions (25 degrees C/20 degrees C day and night temperature) in a glass house. At three leaf stage, plants were subjected to heat stress (HS) by increasing temperature (40 degrees C/35 degrees C day and night), while one treatment was kept at control condition. After 7 days of HS, data were collected for seedling morphology. Heat stress reduced these traits by 25% (root weight) to 40% (shoot weight), and shoot biomass was largely affected by heat stress. A GWAS model, fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), identified 43 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) on all chromosomes, except chr7B, were associated under both HS and control conditions. Thirteen QTNs were identified in control, while 30 QTNs were identified in HS condition. In total, 24 haplotypes were identified at TaHST1 locus, and most of the heat tolerant genotypes were assigned to Hap-20 and Hap-21. Eleven QTNs were identified within 0.3-3.1 Mb proximity of heat shock protein (HSP).

Eggs and larvae from ambient conditions (produced in the laboratory) were reared at three different pH concentrations (control: pH 7.8: and reduced pH treatments: pH 7.5 and 7.0) for 21 days in the laboratory. Dissolved oxygen concentration (8.1 +/- 0.1 mg l(-1)) and temperature (18.6 +/- 0.02 degrees C) were monitored regularly. Then, egg diameter, larval length, weight and survival were measured. There was no relationship between egg diameter and pH or oxygen, but a negative relationship was found with temperature. Survival of larvae was not affected by pH or temperature, whereas dissolved oxygen concentration had a positive effect on number of survivors. The pH did not have a significant effect on the final larval length on day 21, but interacted significantly with dissolved oxygen. Higher temperatures were found to have a positive effect on the final larval length and weight. Larval weight, on the other hand, was not related to pH nor oxygen. Coastal zones are characterized by pH levels that fluctuate due to natural processes, such as upwelling and river runoff.

They depend on the abilities of leaves and silks to expand under fluctuating environmental conditions, so the possibility is raised that they may have a partly common genetic determinism. This possibility was tested in a mapping population which segregates for ASI. Maximum leaf elongation rate per unit thermal time (parameter a) and the slopes of its responses to evaporative demand and soil water status (parameters b and c) were measured in greenhouse and growth chamber experiments, in two series of 120 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) studied in 2004 and 2005 with 33 RILs in common both years. ASI was measured in three and five fields under well-watered conditions and water deficit, respectively. For each RIL, the maximum elongation rate per unit thermal time was reproducible over several experiments in well-watered plants. It was accounted for by five QTLs, among which three co-localized with QTLs of ASI of well-watered plants. The alleles conferring high leaf elongation rate conferred a low ASI (high silk elongation rate). The responses of leaf elongation rate to evaporative demand and to predawn leaf water potential were linear, allowing each RIL to be characterized by the slopes of these response curves. These slopes had three QTLs in common with ASI of plants under water deficit. The allele for leaf growth maintenance was, in all cases, that for shorter ASI (maintained silk elongation rate). By contrast, other regions influencing ASI had no influence on leaf growth.

Latent heat of spray evaporation causes change in the surrounding temperature and wind velocity, resulting in further alterations in temperature, wind velocity and heat flux. Spray in a surf zone with large breaking waves may have unignorable effect on determination of a local meteorological field because of this interconnected relationship as well as its higher population than in the open ocean. In this study, the effects of the spray latent heat on a meteorological field were investigated. The authors propose a method for estimating latent heat of spray vaporization over the ocean. The method was applied to a meso-scale meteorological model to perform numerical experiments with consideration of heat flux by spray. Although the contribution of heat flux on the ocean was as small as 2.5%, fluctuations of air temperature and wind velocity increased over time due to the effects of spray. The fluctuations are thought to cause uncertainty in weather prediction. Numerical experiments with spray provided predictions of air temperature and wind velocity near a coast line that were consistent with observational data, especially when the population of spray droplets increased by two orders of magnitude as is often observed in a coastal area.

Our results show that the rate of water uptake by the eggs was higher in wet than in dry substrate and varied across development. More important, during the first third of development, the egg mass changes were relatively independent of the soil moisture level; they became very sensitive to moisture levels during the other two-thirds. Moreover, hydric conditions exerted a strong influence on the eggs' long-term sensitivity to the moisture of the substrate. Even short-term episodes of high or low levels of moisture modified permanently their water sensitivity, notably through modification of eggshell shape and volume, and in turn entailed significant effects on hatchling mass (and hence offspring quality).

The results indicate that saturated warm frozen soils can exhibit excess pore-water pressure when subjected to external loads. The pore-water pressure fluctuates rather than varying monotonically, and it gradually increases with increasing compressive deformation as the pores are compressed. Furthermore, the permeability of the soil allows pressure dissipation. Thus, the pore-water pressure is continuously changing because of the interactions between these two opposing processes. The peak pore-water pressure follows an exponential relationship with the soil temperature and decreases to a steady value as the temperature decreases.

I.",,,Multiple Physiological Responses to Multiple Environmental Challenges: An Individual Approach,INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The injection of anthropogenically-produced CO2 into the atmosphere will lead to an increase in temperature and a decrease in pH at the surface of the oceans by 2100. Marine intertidal organisms possess the ability to cope in the short term with environmental fluctuations exceeding predicted values. However, how they will cope with chronic exposure to elevated temperature and pCO(2) is virtually unknown. In addition, individuals from the same species/population often show remarkable levels of variation in their responses to complex climatic changes: in particular, variation in metabolic rates often is linked to differences in individuals' performances and fitness. Despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, inter-individual variation has rarely been investigated within the context of climatic changes, and most investigations have typically employed orthogonal experimental designs paired to analyses of independent samples. Although this is undoubtedly a powerful and useful approach, it may not be the most appropriate for understanding all alterations of biological functions in response to environmental changes. An individual approach arguably should be favored when trying to describe organisms' responses to climatic change. Consequently, to test which approach had the greater power to discriminate the intensity and direction of an organism's response to complex climatic changes, we investigated the extracellular osmo/iono-regulatory abilities, upper thermal tolerances (UTTs), and metabolic rates of individual adults of an intertidal amphipod, Echinogammarus marinus, exposed for 15 days to combined elevated temperature and pCO(2). The individual approach led to stronger and different predictions on how ectotherms will likely respond to ongoing complex climatic change, compared with the independent approaches. Consequently, this may call into question the relevance, or even the validity, of some of the predictions made to date. Finally, we argue that treating individual differences as biologically meaningful can lead to a better understanding of the physiological responses themselves and the selective processes that will occur with complex climatic changes; selection will likely play a crucial role in defining species' responses to future environmental changes. Individuals with higher metabolic rates were also characterized by greater extracellular osmo/iono-regulative abilities and higher UTTs, and thus there appeared to be no evolutionary trade-offs between these functions. However, as individuals with greater metabolic rates also have greater costs for maintenance and repair, and likely a lower fraction of energy available for growth and reproduction, trade-offs between life-history and physiological performance may still arise.",,,,,"Turner, Lucy/GRR-1515-2022; Turner, Lucy/B-8495-2013; Truebano, Manuela/AAO-4545-2021","Turner, Lucy/0000-0002-9052-9498; bertolini, camilla/0000-0003-1198-5557; Calosi, Piero/0000-0003-3378-2603; Truebano, Manuela/0000-0003-2586-6524",,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,OCT,2013,53,4,,,,,660,670,,10.1093/icb/ict041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/ict041,,,,,,,,23660590,,,,,WOS:000324833500011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The exposure of plants for a 24 hr anthesis induction period in a dry room at constant temperatures of 22-degrees +/- 1-degrees-C or of 27-degrees +/- 1-degrees-C resulted in flowering 8 days later. When plants were exposed to 22-degrees-C or to 30-degrees-C until anthesis, the duration from anthesis induction to anthesis was the same in both cases (8 days). Flowers always opened about 5:30 am and wilted near noon independently of the time of day of the beginning of the flowering induction stimulus. The flowering date was influenced by the daytime of the beginning of the induction period (24 hr of constant temperature).

For organisms with short generation times, seasonal variation is experienced across, rather than within, generations. How this affects the seasonal evolution of thermal tolerance and phenotypic plasticity is understudied, but has direct implications for the thermal ecology of these organisms. Here we document intra-annual patterns of thermal tolerance in two species ofAcartiacopepods (Crustacea) from a highly seasonal estuary, showing strong variation across the annual temperature cycle. Common garden, split-brood experiments indicate that this seasonal variation in thermal tolerance, along with seasonal variation in body size and phenotypic plasticity, is likely affected by genetic polymorphism.

In this study, first wind tunnel experiments were conducted to generate both unstable and stable turbulent thermal boundary layers in a thermally stratified wind tunnel at Tokyo Polytechnic University. The decrease of turbulence due to the effect of buoyancy was clearly observed in a stable boundary layer. Then a precursor method using a long domain and a recycling procedure using a short domain to generate the turbulence statistics corresponding to the experimental data were investigated for both unstable and stable conditions. The characteristics of the generated flow (mean profiles and fluctuation profiles) by both methods agreed relatively well with those of the wind tunnel experimental data. When a recycling procedure was adopted to generate turbulence statistics in a stable boundary layer, large damping was necessary to decrease the turbulence level. For the temperature field, giving only a mean profile (no temperature fluctuation) as an inflow boundary condition of the driver region was the simplest way. Even if the inflow temperature fluctuation was not given, temperature fluctuation gradually developed in the downstream direction with velocity fluctuation in the turbulent boundary layer.

There was no shift in the optimum temperature for photosynthesis (T-opt) on a seasonal basis and T-opt (approximate to 26 C) was at least 10 C higher than daily maximum air temperature during most of the growing season. Lack of photosynthetic adjustment in Tipularia to seasonal fluctuations in temperature and light suggested that the photosynthetic characteristics of this wintergreen were more similar to those of spring ephemerals than to those of evergreens and summer-active herbs. The decline in photosynthetic capacity during the winter growing season for Tipularia, largely due to leaf age effects, gradually reduced net photosynthetic rates in the field despite more favorable light and temperature conditions. Photosynthesis in the field was primarily limited by environmental conditions in early- and mid-season and by photosynthetic capacity in late-season. A (CO2)-C-14 labelling experiment demonstrated that patterns of carbon allocation to vegetative structures were affected by the season of photosynthetic carbon fixation, whereas reproductive structures received 21% of the recovered labelled carbon regardless of the period of labelling.

A very good growth of plants and an increase of 49% of tomato yield has been noted in the heated greenhouse. The thermal energy restored by this system covers a large part of the greenhouse heating requirements.

These thermal changes can affect numerous traits, from molecular to ecological scales. Biotic stressors are already known to induce the release of chemical cues which trigger behavioural responses in other individuals. In this study, we infer whether fluctuating temperature, as an abiotic stressor, may similarly induce stress-like responses in individuals not directly exposed to the stressor. To test this hypothesis, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed for 24 h to fluctuating thermal stress, to medium in which another embryo was thermally stressed before (stress medium), and to a combination of these. Growth, behaviour, expression of molecular markers, and of whole-embryo cortisol were used to characterise the thermal stress response and its propagation between embryos. Both fluctuating high temperature and stress medium significantly accelerated development, by shifting stressed embryos from segmentation to pharyngula stages, and altered embryonic activity. Importantly, we found that the expression of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), the antioxidant gene SOD1, and of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) were significantly altered by stress medium. This study illustrates the existence of positive thermal stress feedback loops in zebrafish embryos where heat stress can induce stress-like responses in conspecifics, but which might operate via different molecular pathways.

Experiments were carried out at 5 to 75 degrees C, using the protocol of Kinsman and Holland [Kinsman, D.J.J., Holland, H.D., 1969. The coprecipitation of cations with CaCO3: IV. The coprecipitation of Sr2+ with aragonite between 16 and 96 degrees C. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 33, 1-17.] The concentrations of M, Sr, and Ba were determined in the fluid from each experiment by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, and in individual aragonite grains by secondary ion mass spectrometry. The experimentally produced aragonite grains are enriched in trace components (impurities) relative to the concentrations expected from crystal-fluid equilibrium, indicating that kinetic processes are controlling element distribution. Our data are not consistent with fractionations produced kinetically in a boundary layer adjacent to the growing crystal because Sr, a compatible element, is enriched rather than depleted in the aragonite. Element compatibilities, and the systematic change in partitioning with temperature, can be explained by the process of surface entrapment proposed by Watson and Liang [Watson, E.B., Liang, Y., 1995. A simple model for sector zoning in slowly grown crystals: implications for growth rate and lattice diffusion, with emphasis on accessory minerals in crustal rocks. Ani. Mineral. 80, 1179-1187] and Watson [Watson, E.B., 1996. Surface enrichment and trace-element uptake during crystal growth. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 60, 5013-5020; Watson, E.B., 2004. A conceptual model for near-surface kinetic controls on the trace-element and stable isotope composition of abiogenic calcite crystals. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 68, 1473-1488]. This process is thought to operate in regimes where the competition between crystal growth rate and diffusivity in the near-surface region limits the extent to which the solid can achieve partitioning equilibrium with the fluid. A comparison of the skeletal composition of Diploria labyrinthiformis (brain coral) collected on Bermuda with results from precipitation calculations carried out using our experimentally determined partition coefficients indicate that the fluid from which coral skeleton precipitates has a Sr/ Ca ratio comparable to that of seawater, but is depleted in Mg and Ba, and that there are seasonal fluctuations in the mass fraction of aragonite precipitated from the calcifying fluid (precipitation efficiency). The combined effects of surface entrapment during aragonite growth and seasonal fluctuations in precipitation efficiency likely forms the basis for the temperature information recorded in the aragonite skeletons of Scleractinian corals.

We exposed Exaiptasia anemones to Gradual Thermal Stress (GTS) and Heat Shock (HS) exposures and monitored chlorophyll and symbiont dynamics to test the phenotypic plasticity of these photosynthetic holobionts. GTS enhanced chlorophyll concentrations and dedreased Symbiodinium proliferation. A recovery period after GTS returned chlorophyll to lower concentrations and symbiont divisions to higher rates. HS triggered a stress response characterized by intense symbiont declines through degradation and expulsion, algal compensatory proliferation, and chlorophyll accumulation. Anemones pre-exposed to GTS displayed more acute signs of symbiont paucity after HS, demonstrating that recurrent stress does not always induce bleaching-resistance. Our study is the first documenting Symbiodinium C and D, along with the predominant Clade B1 in Exaiptasia anemones. C subclades found in outdoor specimens faded under laboratory exposures. Clade D emerged after HS treatments, and especially after GTS pre-exposure. This highlights the thermotolerance of D subclades found in E. pallida and shows that bleaching-recovery can involve shifts of background symbiont phylotypes. This study enlightens the capability of Exaiptasia anemones to acclimate to gradually increased temperatures, and explores into how thermal history influences in subsequent stress tolerance in symbiotic cnidarians.

A detailed investigation of the dynamics of the intraseasonal variations is carried out using an ocean general circulation model, namely, the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Two parallel experiments are performed in the tropical Atlantic Ocean basin for the period 2000-03: one is forced by daily scatterometer winds from the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite together with other forcing fields, and the other is forced by the low-passed 80-day version of the above fields. To help in understanding the role played by the wind-driven equatorial waves, a linear continuously stratified ocean model is also used. Within 3 degrees S-3 degrees N of the equatorial region, the strong 40-60-day sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and thermocline variability result mainly from the first and second baroclinic modes equatorial Kelvin waves that are forced by intraseasonal zonal winds, with the second baroclinic mode playing a more important role. Sharp 40-50-day peaks of zonal and meridional winds appear in both the QuikSCAT and Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) data for the period 2002-03, and they are especially strong in 2002. Zonal wind anomaly in the central-western equatorial basin for the period 2000-06 is significantly correlated with SSHA across the equatorial basin, with simultaneous/ lag correlation ranging from-0.62 to 0.74 above 95% significance. Away from the equator (3 degrees-5 degrees N), however, sea level and thermocline variations in the 40-60-day band are caused largely by tropical instability waves (TIWs). On 10-40-day time scales and west of 10 degrees W, the spectral power of sea level and thermocline appears to be dominated by TIWs within 5 degrees S-5 degrees N of the equatorial region. The wind-driven circulation, however, also provides a significant contribution. Interestingly, east of 10 W, SSHA and thermocline variations at 10 40- day periods result almost entirely from wind-driven equatorial waves. During the boreal spring of 2002 when TIWs are weak, Kelvin waves dominate the SSHA across the equatorial basin (2 degrees S-2 degrees N). The observed quasi-biweekly Yanai waves are excited mainly by the quasi-biweekly meridional winds, and they contribute significantly to the SSHA and thermocline variations in 1 degrees-5 degrees N and 1 degrees-5 degrees S regions.",,,,,"Hu, Aixue/E-1063-2013; Fu, Rong/B-4922-2011; Fu, Rong/GMX-1257-2022","Hu, Aixue/0000-0002-1337-287X; Fu, Rong/0000-0002-4065-248X; Fu, Rong/0000-0002-4065-248X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,1520-0485,,,,MAY,2008,38,5,,,,,945,967,,10.1175/2008JPO3854.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2008JPO3854.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000255954700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The solar forcing is provided for radiative properties, namely total solar irradiance (TSI), solar spectral irradiance (SSI), and the F10.7 index as well as particle forcing, including geomagnetic indices Ap and Kp, and ionization rates to account for effects of solar protons, electrons, and galactic cosmic rays. This is the first time that a recommendation for solar-driven particle forcing has been provided for a CMIP exercise. The solar forcing datasets are provided at daily and monthly resolution separately for the CMIP6 preindustrial control, historical (1850-2014), and future (2015-2300) simulations. For the preindustrial control simulation, both constant and time-varying solar forcing components are provided, with the latter including variability on 11-year and shorter timescales but no long-term changes. For the future, we provide a realistic scenario of what solar behavior could be, as well as an additional extreme Maunder-minimum-like sensitivity scenario. This paper describes the forcing datasets and also provides detailed recommendations as to their implementation in current climate models. For the historical simulations, the TSI and SSI time series are defined as the average of two solar irradiance models that are adapted to CMIP6 needs: an empirical one (NRLTSI2-NRLSSI2) and a semi-empirical one (SATIRE). A new and lower TSI value is recommended: the contemporary solar-cycle average is now 1361.0 W m(-2). The slight negative trend in TSI over the three most recent solar cycles in the CMIP6 dataset leads to only a small global radiative forcing of -0.04 W m(-2). In the 200-400 nm wavelength range, which is important for ozone photochemistry, the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset shows a larger solar-cycle variability contribution to TSI than in CMIP5 (50% compared to 35 %). We compare the climatic effects of the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset to its CMIP5 predecessor by using time-slice experiments of two chemistry-climate models and a reference radiative transfer model. The differences in the long-term mean SSI in the CMIP6 dataset, compared to CMIP5, impact on climatological stratospheric conditions (lower shortwave heating rates of -0.35 K day(-1) at the stratopause), cooler stratospheric temperatures (-1.5K in the upper stratosphere), lower ozone abundances in the lower stratosphere (3 %), and higher ozone abundances (+1.5% in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere). Between the maximum and minimum phases of the 11-year solar cycle, there is an increase in shortwave heating rates (+0.2 K day(-1) at the stratopause), temperatures (similar to 1 K at the stratopause), and ozone (+2.5% in the upper stratosphere) in the tropical upper stratosphere using the CMIP6 forcing dataset. This solar-cycle response is slightly larger, but not statistically significantly different from that for the CMIP5 forcing dataset. CMIP6 models with a well-resolved shortwave radiation scheme are encouraged to prescribe SSI changes and include solar-induced stratospheric ozone variations, in order to better represent solar climate variability compared to models that only prescribe TSI and/or exclude the solar-ozone response. We show that monthly-mean solar-induced ozone variations are implicitly included in the SPARC/CCMI CMIP6 Ozone Database for historical simulations, which is derived from transient chemistry-climate model simulations and has been developed for climate models that do not calculate ozone interactively. CMIP6 models without chemistry that perform a preindustrial control simulation with time-varying solar forcing will need to use a modified version of the SPARC/CCMI Ozone Database that includes solar variability. CMIP6 models with interactive chemistry are also encouraged to use the particle forcing datasets, which will allow the potential long-term effects of particles to be addressed for the first time. The consideration of particle forcing has been shown to significantly improve the representation of reactive nitrogen and ozone variability in the polar middle atmosphere, eventually resulting in further improvements in the representation of solar climate variability in global models.",,,,,"Szelag, Monika Ewa/AAH-3529-2019; Sinnhuber, Miriam/A-7252-2013; Verronen, P.

These environmental changes are projected to intensify further in the future, and we still know little about how they will affect ecological processes driving harmful cyanobacterial bloom formation. Therefore, we conducted a long-term experiment in 400-L shallow freshwater mesocosms, where we evaluated the effects of a constant +4 degrees C increase in mean water temperatures and compared it with a fluctuating warming scenario ranging from 0 to +8 degrees C (i.e., including heat waves) but with the same +4 degrees C long-term elevation in mean water temperatures. We focused on investigating not only warming effects on cyanobacterial pelagic dynamics (phenology and biomass levels), but also on their recruitment from sediments-which are a fundamental part of their life history for which the response to warming remains largely unexplored. Our results demonstrate that (1) a warmer environment not only induces a seasonal advancement and boosts biomass levels of specific cyanobacterial species in the pelagic environment, but also increases their recruitment rates from the sediments, and (2) these species-specific benthic and pelagic processes respond differently depending on whether climate warming is expressed only as an increase in mean water temperatures or, in addition, through an increased warming variability (including heat waves). These results are important because they show, for the first time, that climate warming can affect cyanobacterial dynamics at different life-history stages, all the way from benthic recruitment up to their establishment in the pelagic community. Furthermore, it also highlights that both cyanobacterial benthic recruitment and pelagic biomass dynamics may be different as a result of changes in the variability of warming conditions. We argue that these findings are a critical first step to further our understanding of the relative importance of increased recruitment rates for harmful cyanobacterial bloom formation under different climate change scenarios.",,,,,"Chaguaceda, Fernando/AAO-2991-2020","Chaguaceda, Fernando/0000-0002-0827-2110; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Urrutia Cordero, Pablo/0000-0001-9560-8374",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JUL,2020,101,7,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.3025,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.3025,,MAR 2020,,,,,,32083737,,,,,WOS:000520821300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The concepts were analyzed with regard to thermal comfort, spatial homogeneity, heat removal efficiency and their capability of integration. The studies were conducted using thermal manikins in a generic train cabin, that is, the lower level of a double-deck high-speed train DLR's Next Generation Train NGT. Various ventilation concepts comprising state of the art micro-jet ventilation (MJV) as well as novel low-momentum ventilation concepts were investigated. The novel concepts are floor-based cabin displacement ventilation (CDV), low-momentum ceiling-based ventilation (LMCV), a hybrid (HV) combination of CDV and LMCV as well as hatrack-integrated low-momentum ventilation (HLMV). The results proved that all investigated concepts have advantages and disadvantages. The recorded mean air velocities of all concepts are well below the limiting values defined in the standard for long-distance rolling stock. However, the analysis of the instantaneous velocities revealed that classical mixing ventilation exceeded the thresholds from time to time. Regarding the capability of integration, the floor-based CDV and the hatrack-integrated concept turned out to be advantageous since no space in the aisle zone is required. For the HLMV concept, which is fully integrated in the hatracks, stronger horizontal temperature fluctuations were recorded highlighting the need to optimize the HLMV air outlets. In the current stage, LMCV and the hybrid approach were found to be the best concepts. They were not rated as critical in any of the considered categories.",,,,,,"Schmeling, Daniel/0000-0003-2712-9974",,,,,,,,,,,,,0360-1323,1873-684X,,,,SEP,2020,182,,,,,,,,107116,10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107116,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107116,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000569356700004,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Millot, C",,,,"Millot, Claude",,,Heterogeneities of in- and out-flows in the Mediterranean Sea,PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper develops a relatively new concept regarding the outflow of Mediterranean Waters (MWs) through the Strait of Gibraltar. While other papers assume that this outflow is composed of only two MWs, we previously found evidence from a re-analysis of 1980s CTD profiles (profiles collected with conductivity-temperature-depth probes during GIBEX, the Gibraltar Experiment), for two other MWs. We also analysed 2003-2008 time series from two CTDs moored (HYDROCHANGES Programme) at the southern sill of Camarinal and on the shelf of Morocco, and we developed a new concept. East of the Strait, the four MWs roughly lay one above the other, but while progressing westward, the associated isopycnals tilt up southward. In the Strait, the MWs are thus juxtaposed, and they all mix with one of two Atlantic Water components (the inflow acronym is thus AWs), and the outflow is horizontally heterogeneous. West of the Strait, the outflow progressively becomes vertically heterogeneous again, hence splitting into a series of superimposed veins. We compared these CTD time series with one collected at the southern sill of Espartel (University of Malaga, INGRES projects and HYDROCHANGES Programme). Fortunately, the CTDs moored at the two sills were generally along the same streamlines so that the MWs' evolution could be monitored. We demonstrated the significance of mixing lines computed from two successive records and the possibility of linking two sets of data (such as CTD profiles) collected at different locations along the Strait. The outflow, which does not show any clear seasonal variability before the Strait, strongly mixes with the inflow within the Strait. This is due mainly to the internal tide and, because the inflow is seasonally variable, leads to an outflow that displays marked seasonal and fortnightly variabilities. Both the outflow and the inflow also display marked spatial heterogeneity and both long-term/yearly and short-term/daily temporal variabilities before they mix; thus, accurately predicting the outflow characteristics in the Atlantic Ocean appears almost impossible. Herein, we first propose a fully objective description of the AWs and MWs during two GIBEX campaigns. Where the AWs and the MWs do not markedly mix, they are defined in terms of density and temperature ranges. Where a MW mixes with one of the AWs down to the bottom, the mixing line characteristics allow for that MW to be followed from one section to one downstream and for the validation of our concept: while superimposed east of the Strait, the MWs come to be juxtaposed within the Strait before becoming superimposed again. We also analysed additional CTD time series collected by the University of Malaga on the south and north sides of the southern sill of Espartel. We demonstrate the following: (a) even though the MWs at the sill (E) and on the south side (ES) were roughly the same, the densest ones out-flowed at ES, i.e., at depths shallower than at E, (b) the MWs on the north side (EN) were very different from those at E and each mixed with different AWs, and (c) using the mixing lines computed from each time series, the data recorded at E and ES allow for the retrieval, with good accuracy, of those recorded at Camarinal (C), which is not the case for the data recorded at EN. Finally we emphasise how different the AWs' heterogeneities are from the MWs' heterogeneities. The inflow is sucked into the Mediterranean Sea, due to the water budget (E-P) deficit there, and it can be composed of any type of AW present west of the Strait at any time and any specific location. The outflow is a product of the Mediterranean Sea, which is like a machine producing a series of MWs that first circulate as alongslope density currents before entering the Strait in a specific order and at specific locations. Consequently, we attempt to schematise the AWs-MWs mixing processes and our understanding of the outflow dynamics. Notwithstanding the difficulty of the working conditions within such a narrow strait, having up to four MWs outflowing side-by-side and mixing with two AWs that have a heterogeneous and variable distribution clearly leads to spatial and temporal heterogeneities that are actually much larger than the ones that have been observed up to now from a relatively low number of CTD profiles and time series.

The heat load was gradually increased from 40 to 80 W/floor-m(2) while the target temperature of exhaust air was kept at 26 +/- 0.5 degrees C. Experiments were carried out in a test room by conducting measurements with omnidirectional anemometers, data loggers and marker-smoke visualizations. The heat load consisted of two opposite workstations next to heated window panels in the perimeter area. The other side of the room was an open area describing a corridor zone. The workstation had a seated test dummy with laptop and monitor. The results indicate that asymmetrical heat load distribution creates a large-scale circulating airflow pattern from the heat sources to the opposite side of the room. Furthermore, the mean air speed and the airflow fluctuation increased with heat load and supply airflow rate. Consequently, also the turbulent kinetic energy and the turbulence dissipation increased. However, heat load had only a small effect on the turbulence intensity and the fluctuation energy ratio. Therefore, draught rate increased significantly with mean air speed. The observed results agree mainly with the symmetrical heat load results otherwise, except for the systematic large-scale circulation that was not found in the symmetrical test case. The maximum draught rate was 18-21% indicating the category B-C of thermal environment defined by the European Standard EN ISO 7730:2005.

The current study is the first comprehensive approach to the spatial distribution and the fluctuations in abundance, biomass, community structure, and diversity of the mesozooplankton from different habitats located in Scotia Bay in summers: 2014 and 2015, characterized by a different timing in seasonal sea ice retreat. Mean seawater temperature and abundances of calanoids, cyclopoids, nauplii, and appendicularians were one order of magnitude higher in summer 2014.

In the northeast Pacific, the forest-forming giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C. Agardh periodically experiences widespread adult mortality during extended periods of extremely low nutrients and high temperatures, such as those associated with El Nino. Recovery following these periods is hypothesized to occur from microscopic life stages that delay their development until the return of favorable conditions. In the laboratory, we experimentally examined the environmental conditions responsible for regulating delayed development of the microscopic stages of M. pyrifera from Southern California, USA. Nutrients controlled the delay and resumption of gametophyte growth and reproduction, perhaps linked to the large fluctuations in nutrients occurring seasonally and interannually in this region. Although growth of gametophytes proceeded in the virtual absence of nitrate, both nitrate and other trace nutrients were necessary for gametogenesis. Upon exposure to elevated nutrients, delayed gametophytes produced sporophytes more quickly (5-20 d) and at smaller sizes (10-200 mu m) than gametophytes that had never been delayed (18-80 d, 80-400 mu m, respectively), reducing negative density-dependent effects. This finding demonstrates that delayed gametophytes of M. pyrifera rapidly utilize increased resources to consistently produce sporophytes.

In particular, measurements can take place even during dry periods, when high temperatures increase actual evapotranspiration on the catchment and diurnal streamflow fluctuation changes occur in a harmonic wave at any time of the day. Some 10-15 years ago, a current runoff measurement record based on a high resolution equipment clearly recognizing a diurnal wave-shape fluctuation could hardly be available. The measurement of discharge ordinates from the catchment, and from free water pan evaporation, showed an undulating fluctuation tendency. However, the discharge minima appeared at day time and their maxima at night. The measured discharge data are represented not only by a fluctuating form, but also by a mild form, an even straight line, or by a flat depletion curve. For the purpose of analyzing the wave shape of discharge we implemented the Fourier series model, simulating the measured data through the Fourier input, output, and transformation coefficients. The purpose of this analysis was to use the Fourier equations in order to substitute the missing data (when the discharge or evaporation measurements collapsed). Due to very sensitive data, when the measured discharge series are jagged, the equation can be smoothed by the harmonic approximation or by the polynomial approximation. Our study was carried out on the small experimental catchment of the Starosuchdolsky Brook, in the vicinity of the campus of the Czech University of Life Sciences Prague.

The experiment was carried out over two consecutive years in an experimental orchard located in Torre Pacheco (Murcia, Spain) in 18-year-old 'Fino 49' lemon trees (Citrus limon (L.) Burm. fil.) grafted on Citrus macrophylla Wester. Well-watered trees were maintained with surface (SUR) and subsurface (SUB) drip irrigation systems by applying irrigation water independently, maintaining in both systems the soil water content of the root zone at approximate to 80% of the amount of water available and the midday stem water potential (Psi(stem)) > -1.3 MPa. Following these criterias for irrigation scheduling, the use of the SUB system increased the water use efficiency in lemon trees, due to an irrigation water saving of 19% without the yield being affected. However, the SUB system induced different trunk growth dynamics, which produced different reference equations for the maximum daily trunk shrinkage (MDS) and Psi(stem). In spite of this, the prediction power of MDS was similar for both systems. In both cases, the environmental variable that best correlated with Psi(stem) and MDS was the daily mean air temperature. Thus, based on these results, MDS measurements can be suitable for adjusting the irrigation scheduling of lemon trees, but differences found between irrigation systems in the MDS reference baselines highlight the necessity of determining the baselines for each irrigation system.

The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) on the soil nutrient balances, infiltration, and stability of cyanobacterial soil crusts (CSCs) in the temperate desert region. A controlled incubation experiment was carried out to study the effects of diurnal freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) on total soil carbon (TC), total soil nitrogen (TN), soil TC/TN, hydraulic conductivity, and strength of light and dark cyanobacterial crusts, respectively. Six successive diurnal FTCs were applied as three temperature regimes (i.e., six successive mild FTCs (mild), six successive severe FTCs (severe), three successive mild FTCs followed by three successive severe FTCs (medium)). The experiment intended to simulate natural temperature changes in one of the temperate regions of northern China. Compared with dark CSCs cores, light CSCs cores lost a greater proportion of nitrogen. For both crust cores, severe FTCs decreased TC and TN more than mild FTCs. However, TC and TN remained relative constant when CSCs cores were treated with severe FTCs after experiencing mild FTCs. TC and TN of both CSCs cores decreased in the earlier FTCs and then remained stable in the later FTCs. TC/TN increased significantly for light CSCs, but only changed slightly for dark CSCs after successive FTCs. The effects of FTCs on the hydraulic conductivity and strength of CSCs were not consistent with our expectations that FTCs would increase hydrological conductivity and decrease strength. These effects depended on crust type, FTC number, and freeze/thaw intensity. Increase in hydraulic conductivity and decrease in strength only occurred in severe treatment in the dark CSCs during the later FTCs. Light CSCs are more sensitive to FTCs than dark CSCs. Mild FTCs decrease less TC and TN than severe FTCs and mostly increase the stability of the CSCs.

Characterizing the phenology of plant nutrient uptake in relation to these processes is essential to understanding the current and future productivity of Arctic ecosystems. 2. In wet sedge meadows located near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, soil microbial biomass as well as inorganic and organic nutrient pools fluctuate seasonally, with late-winter peaks followed by declines of these variables during the early stages of soil thaw; however, it is unknown if the dominant plant in this community takes up nitrogen when levels of this nutrient are high but soil temperatures are 0 degrees C or below. 3. Stable isotope tracing was utilized by injecting 15NH(4)Cl into soil cores and incubating for 1 or 8 days during spring thaw to determine the short-term capacity for uptake and transport of inorganic nitrogen into Carex aquatilis (roots, shoots and rhizomes), moss and soil micro-organisms during this transitional time of year. 4. During three 8-day experimental trials in April and May 2007, C. aquatilis roots accumulated a substantial amount of the added nitrogen (33.5% increasing to 63.4%), when inorganic nitrogen was readily available in the soil, but declining. A smaller proportion of injected nitrogen was recovered from soil microbes (30% decreasing to 7%), and only trace amounts of injected 15N were measured in plant shoots, shoot bases, rhizomes and mosses (2% or less). 5.Synthesis. Shifting seasonal patterns in northern ecosystems resulting from climate change are likely to alter the progression of events that lead up to the summer growing season. A substantial pool of inorganic nitrogen resides temporarily in the soil at the end of winter, and we have shown here that plants are able to take up nitrogen at this time. Increases in the frequency and temperature highs of late-winter warming events are likely to trigger early episodes of soil thaw, potentially reducing the capacity of plants to take up this large ephemeral supply of nitrogen in early spring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,JUL,2010,98,4,,,,,737,744,,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01675.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01675.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000278675000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

M.; Vorenhout, Michel; Kooijman, Annemieke M.",,,Impacts of short-term droughts and inundations in species-rich fens during summer and winter: Large-scale field manipulation experiments,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,,,,,,,,,,,,"For the conservation and restoration of biodiverse rich fens, base-rich and nutrient-poor conditions are vital. In wetlands with artificially stable surface water levels, the re-introduction of temporary water level fluctuations has been postulated to restore the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of fens during inundation and to reduce surface water P-input during episodes with drought. This is the first study testing this hypothesis in large-scale field manipulation experiments in rich fens with threatened rich fen mosses, rich fens with Calliergonella, and poor fens with Sphagnum. Five different experiments were conducted: 2 weeks of raised levels (+ 10 cm) in a floating and a non-floating fen during winter, 2 weeks of high levels in a non-floating fen during summer, and 2 weeks of lowered levels (-15 cm) in a floating and a non-floating fen during summer. For floating fens, both lowered and raised surface water levels in adjacent ditches did not show any effect on water tables, soil ANC or nutrient levels in fens. For non-floating fens, raised surface water levels led to inundation in all vegetation types, without affecting nutrient concentrations or vegetation. Although redox potentials decreased immediately in upper soils, ANC was generally not enhanced in winter due to limited infiltration into the waterlogged soils. In summer, in contrast, ANC increased because accelerated evapotranspiration led to enhanced infiltration of inundation water and higher temperatures resulted in microbial alkalinity generation. Short-term lowering of surface water levels in summer led to lower water tables in non-floating fens, but only when precipitation rates were low. Vegetation, ANC and nutrient concentrations were, however, not affected. The effectiveness of short-term surface water level fluctuation to restore ANC strongly depends on peat buoyancy, water saturation of soils, season and weather conditions. This explains why short-term inundation in winter is often inadequate, while short-term inundation in summer does increase ANC. Short-term droughts do not affect the ANC or nutrient availability. Our results are not only important for the hydrological management of fens, but also have implications for future management since short-term extreme weather events will occur more frequently due to climate change.

During construction work, topsoil is stockpiled in a way that can harm seed germination and survival capacity. In order to assess the effects of topsoil storage time and seed burial depth on seed survival, germination and mortality, an experiment with three replicates was conducted using two factors: time (1-6 months) and burial depth (0, 5, 30 and 50 cm). At each stockpile depth we buried 25 seeds from 10 natural grassland species (5 families) in permeable nylon sachets. Seed mass and seed functional responses to light (LI) and diurnal temperature fluctuations (DTF) were also measured for each species. Seed survival, germination and mortality during stockpiling were analyzed using binomial GLMs. Explanatory variables were family, depth of burial, time, seed mass. LI and DTF responses. Seed survival decreased with storage time but increases with depth. Seed losses were due to seed germination and mortality in the stockpile. Germination percentage increased with time but decreased with burial depth. This parameter was negatively related to LI and DTF. Mortality increased significantly with time and depth and was negatively related to seed mass. Results show that there may be a loss of viable seeds in topsoil stockpiles, particularly in the case of large seeds. Our results also underline the functional role of light requirements for germination and the detection of diurnal temperature fluctuations as mechanisms to achieve higher soil seed persistence. The correct management of topsoil is decisive for the restoration of roadslopes. Seed germination potential decrease with time of storage and burial depth, consequently a serious loss of seeds conducts an impoverishing of topsoil, which is the main natural resource for the restoration of these disturbed ecosystems. Viable seed loss is lower in deeper layers of the stockpile, so short-period topsoil storage and bigger stockpiles could reduce seed loss and increase thus the restoration potential of topsoil.

We conducted a manipulative field experiment in an alpine swamp meadow to investigate the responses of ecosystem respiration (ER) to simulated warming and N addition. Results showed that the interaction between warming and N addition significantly increased ER by 41.3-239.6%, which might be related to the enhancements in plant autotrophic respiration and soil microbial biomass and activity. The correlations between ER and a single hydrothermic factor tended to be weakened with the increasing complexity of the treatment method. The drought stress on CO2 emissions was not found due to the thawing of the permafrost and the upward diffusion of soil moisture, thus air temperature combined with soil temperature explained 80% of the ER fluctuations. Meanwhile, warming increased the aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) by 44.2-68.1% and 48.1-82.6%, respectively, suggesting that more biomass was allocated to the belowground components. N addition increased AGB by 21.2-30.3%, while there was no significant effect on BGB. Warming combined with N addition strongly increased AGB and BGB by 52.0-159.5% and 59.0-102.1%, respectively. These results indicated that plant production and allocation pattern might also be important factors affecting CO2 emissions. In addition, warming alone and warming combined with N addition increased soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) by 19.1-90.7% and 28.1-80.4%, respectively, and the enhancement in soil microbial biomass and activity might promote the release of soil carbon.",,,,,,"Wang, Genxu/0000-0002-3403-0983; Bai, Wei/0000-0002-8054-6753",,,,,,,,,,,,,1164-5563,1778-3615,,,,MAY-JUN,2019,92,,,,,,16,23,,10.1016/j.ejsobi.2019.04.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2019.04.003,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000469158800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, additional research about the Trombe wall is needed to reduce indoor temperature fluctuations and to improve thermal behavior under different climatic conditions. A new Trombe wall system was proposed which uses Venetian blinds and a basement. The field tests were conducted to compare the thermal performance of four types of rooms: (i) no Trombe wall (control), (ii) classical Trombe wall (TW), (iii) Trombe wall with Venetian blinds (TW+VB), and (iv) Trombe wall with Venetian blinds and a basement (TW+VB+B). The field measurements were conducted during the winter near Shihezi City in northwest China. The objective of this study was (i) to evaluate the thermal performance of a novel Trombe wall system under different operation conditions, and (ii) to confirm the optimal angle of Venetian blinds during the heating period. The results demonstrated that the TW+VB+B system effectively reduced indoor temperature fluctuations after sunset. Furthermore, during the daytime, the average air temperatures in the test rooms were 13.6 degrees C higher in the TW+VB+B system than in the control. The average temperature at the air outlet in the TW+VB+B system was 4.9 degrees C higher than that in the TW+VB system during the daytime, and the average predicted mean vote (PMV) of the test room was 1.02 units greater in the TW+VB+B system than in the control. The thermal efficiency remains in the range of 40%-65% when the Venetian blind angle was set at 45 degrees. In conclusion, the experiment results showed that the TW+VB+B system can not only reduce indoor temperature fluctuations but also improve thermal performance in winter. Both the heating energy consumption in buildings and pollutants emission in the environment were lessened through the application of this passive solar energy-saving technology. Therefore, this can provide valuable insights for improving the thermal performance of the novel Trombe Wall system in such village houses.",,,,,"Hei, Shanggang/AAA-4784-2022","Hei, Shanggang/0000-0002-1077-9623",,,,,,,,,,,,,1003-2169,1993-033X,,,,NOV,2021,30,6,,,,,2254,2266,,10.1007/s11630-021-1509-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11630-021-1509-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000712978600031,View Full Record in Web of Science

The high value (1.48) of bacterivorous to fungivorous ratio (B/F) indicates mainly bacterial mediated decomposition, resulting in good soil fertility. The B/F ratio is affected both by large and small-scale changes in soil conditions. Diversity and richness show dependence on seasonal variations as well as on small changes in temperature, while no effect of moisture is recorded.

A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted with two exogenous N forms (NO3--N and NH4+-N), six temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three plant marshes (the invasive S. alterniflora and native Suaeda salsa and Phragmites australis) to investigate these interactive effects on soil net N mineralization rate and net nitrification rate in coastal wetlands. The averaged rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification over incubation temperature from 5 to 30 degrees C were significantly higher in the S. alterniflora marsh than in the S. salsa and P. australis marshes. The differences in N mineralization and nitrification among the tested soils were closely related with soil properties. With the addition of NO3--N, net N mineralization and nitrification were increased in the studied soils by 16-29% and 34-54%, respectively, whereas with the addition of NH4+N, they were increased by 58-69% and 65-94%, respectively. Net mineralization and nitrification in the tested soils increased with incubation temperature from 5 to 30 degrees C regardless of N addition.

In structured populations, phenotypic change can result from changes throughout an individuals lifetime (phenotypic plasticity, age-related changes), selection and changes in population composition (environment- or density-driven fluctuations in age-structure). 2. The contribution of population dynamics to phenotypic change has often been ignored. However, for understanding trait dynamics, it is important to identify both the individual- and population-level mechanisms responsible for trait change, because they potentially reinforce or counteract each other. 3. We use 22 years of field data to investigate the dynamics of a sexually selected phenological trait, the timing of nuptial moult in superb fairy-wrens Malurus cyaneus. 4. We show that trait expression is both climate-and age-dependent, but that phenotypic plasticity in response to climate variability also varies with age. Old males can acquire nuptial plumage very early after high rainfall, but 1- to 2-year-olds cannot. However, males of all ages that defer moult to later in the year acquire nuptial plumage earlier when conditions are warmer. 5. The underlying mechanism appears to be that old males may risk moulting in the most challenging period of the year: in autumn, when drought restricts food abundance and during the cold winter. By contrast, young males always moult during the spring transition to benign - warmer and generally wetter - conditions. Temperature changes dominate this transition that heralds the breeding season, thereby causing both young and late-moulting older birds to be temperature sensitive. 6. Climate and age also affect trait dynamics via a population dynamical pathway. The same high rainfall that triggers early moulting in old males concurrently increases offspring recruitment and thereby reduces the average age of males in the population. Consequently, effects of rainfall on trait dynamics through phenotypic plasticity of old males are dampened by synchronous rejuvenation of the age-structure. 7. A long-term trend towards drier environments prompted phenotypic change because of plasticity, but this was masked by climate-driven demographic change (causing apparent stasis). This suggests a novel explanation for why trait change may fail to reflect the observed pattern of directional selection or phenotypic plasticity.",,,,,"Cockburn, Andrew/A-4864-2008","van de Pol, Martijn/0000-0003-4102-4079",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAR,2012,81,2,,,,,411,422,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01919.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01919.x,,,,,,,,21999931,,,,,WOS:000300502600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Improving photosynthetic efficiency has been proposed as a mechanism to increase the productivity of bioenergy grass species. Fluctuating light, experienced by all field grown crops, is known to reduce photosynthetic efficiency. This experiment aimed to evaluate the photosynthetic performance of both C-3 and C-4 bioenergy grass species under steady state and fluctuating light conditions by examining leaf gas exchange. The fluctuating light regime used here decreased carbon assimilation across all species when compared to expected steady state values. Overall, C-4 species assimilated more carbon than C-3 species during the fluctuating light regime, with both photosynthetic types assimilating about 16% less carbon than expected based on steady state measurements. Little diversity was observed in response to fluctuating light among C-3 species, and photorespiration partially contributed to the rapid decreases in net photosynthetic rates during high to low light transitions. In C-4 species, differences among the four NADP-ME species were apparent. Diversity observed among C-4 species in this experiment provides evidence that photosynthetic efficiency in response to fluctuating light may be targeted to increase C-4 bioenergy grass productivity.",,,,,"Boyd, Ryan/GZH-1468-2022","Ort, Donald/0000-0002-5435-4387",,,,,,,,,,,,,1757-1693,1757-1707,,,,JAN,2022,14,1,,,,,37,53,,10.1111/gcbb.12899,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12899,,OCT 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000712588100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experiment spans much of the subtropical gyre and is a protype for future basin-scale observations. Eddy-resolving transects along the precisely repeating ship track, spanning four years, are used to estimate the mean field and fluctuations of temperature and geostrophic velocity. The mean field dominates on very large spatial scales while the fluctuations dominate on small scales. Mean and fluctuations have equal energy at a horizontal wavelength of about 2000 km. The study region contains three recurring small-scale features. These are the East Auckland Current, flowing eastward along the New Zealand continental slope, a front at about 29-degrees-S which is likely an extension of the Tasman Front, and a weaker feature, the Tropical Convergence at about 22-degrees-S. At lower latitudes in the study region, the entire thermocline migrates vertically at annual period. This annual oscillation ends near the front at 29-degrees-S. Farther poleward, the only substantial subsurface annual variation is in the strength of the East Auckland Current. Interannual variability of circulation during 1986-90 consisted of rapid transitions between two rather steady states.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that obligate brood parasites lay unusually thick-shelled eggs to retain more heat for the developing embryo and thus contribute to early hatching of parasite eggs. By doing so, we used an infrared thermal imaging system as a non-invasive method to quantify the temperature of eggshells of common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and their Oriental reed warbler (Acrocephalus orientalis) hosts in an experiment that artificially altered the duration of incubation. Our results showed that cuckoo eggshells had higher temperature than host eggs during incubation, but also less fluctuations in temperature during incubation disturbance.

Identifying the links within this pathway is imperative for understanding the ecological relevance of effects found at the phenotypic level. Furthermore, experimental studies that examine parts of the pathway in ectothermic organisms often fail to mimic the complexities of the natural developmental environment. Temperature and moisture conditions in reptile nests, for example, can fluctuate greatly on a seasonal and daily basis. Despite the potential effects of fluctuating environments, the vast majority of studies have held environmental treatments constant during the developmental period. We investigated the effects of fluctuating moisture regimes during incubation on eggs, hatchling phenotypes, and subsequent survival in the eastern fence lizard Sceloporus undulatus. Moisture fluctuations during embryonic development caused water absorption by eggs to follow the environmental availability of moisture. Initial hatchling tail length was affected by the pattern of moisture fluctuations, and hatchling growth rates in fluctuating treatments were significantly faster than those in a constant treatment, resulting in larger hatchlings after 4 weeks. A release-recapture experiment conducted in the field did not detect a treatment effect on survival despite the larger body sizes. In summary, although fluctuations affected water absorption by eggs and some hatchling traits, these effects did not have subsequent fitness consequences. The results obtained suggest that egg and hatchling survival are buffered against natural soil moisture fluctuations during incubation, even when egg and hatchling traits are significantly affected.

Microtubules either electrostatically or covalently bound to ammosilane surfaces disassembled at room temperature under buffer solutions with no free tubulin present. This process was followed by taking sequential tapping-mode AFM images and measuring the change in the microtubule end position as a function of time,. with an spatial accuracy down to +/- 20 nm and a temporal accuracy of +/- 1 s. As well as giving average disassembly rates on the order of 1-10 tubulin monomers per second, large fluctuations in the disassembly rate were revealed, indicating that the process is far from smooth and linear under these experimental conditions. The surface bound rates measured here are comparable to the rates for GMPCPP-tubulin microtubules free in solution, suggesting that inhibition of tubulin curvature through steric hindrance controls the average, relatively low disassembly rate. The large fluctuations in this rate are thought to be due to multiple pathways in the kinetics of disassembly with differing rate constants and/or stalling due to defects in the microtubule lattice. Microtubules that were covalently bound to the surface left behind the protofilaments covalently cross-linked to the ammosilane via glutaraldehyde during the disassembly process. Further work is needed to quantitatively assess the effects of surface binding on protofibril disassembly rates, reveal any differences in disassembly rates between the plus and minus ends and to enable assembly as well as disassembly to be imaged in the microscope fluid cell in real-time.

The aim of this study was, by investigating monthly winter survival rates, to examine (1) whether late winter is the most difficult time for birds, and (2) whether temperature, especially in late winter, correlates with survival, as previously proposed. We also sought information on sex and age differences in timing of mortality,rarely studied among passerines. After color-marking, individuals were resighted monthly from September to May. Capture-recapture models were applied to separately estimate survival and resighting probabilities. Survival estimates given by three methods of varying complexity (simple counts, Jolly-Seber, Cormack-Jolly-Seber) were compared. The three different-methods yielded similar survival estimates. Because simple counting does not account for emigration, consistent results from different analyses support the earlier view that Willow Tits are sedentary. Adults survived better than yearlings in all winters and exhibited more constant survival rates. Two-year data also suggest that winter and summer survival rates were similar in adults, but not in yearlings, for which mortality was greatest in winter. Males survived better than females in one winter. Temperature per se did not correlate with survival, but deviations to colder than long-term average temperature seemed to be associated with low survival probability, which could reflect occasional food limitation. A feeding experiment. was conducted to test the winter food limitation hypothesis. Fed birds survived winter better than did control birds, significantly so in yearlings and males, but not in adults or females. previously, late winter has been suggested as being a difficult time for birds.

The latter, of the order of 0.01-0.02 m/a, has been proved to be related to soil CO2 efflux due to organic matter oxidation. A series of CO2 emission measurement campaigns has been performed between the years 2003 and 2005. The non-steady-state chamber method was employed to assess the efflux spatial variability and detect its relationship with the main hydrological parameters controlling the oxidation reaction, i.e., soil temperature, soil moisture, and organic matter content. The measurements, carried out in two sites located 1.5 km apart, point out a great variability of the CO2 emissions both in space and time. While the time-dependent behavior can be explained by the seasonal fluctuation of soil temperature, spatial variability shows a weak correlation with the variation of environmental variables. Statistical data analyses show that CO2 efflux can be considered lognormally distributed and that the process is stationary within each site but not in the whole basin, though the properties of the outcropping peat layer and the soil surface seem apparently uniform. A geostatistical analysis reveals two different spatial correlation structures, with scales of spatial dependence of approximate to 30 m and approximate to 180 m.

Compared to treatments T2 and T3, compost treatments with higher percentage waste filter materials (T1, T4 and T5) had higher N (16,100-21,300 mg/kg), P (1500-2300 mg/kg), K (19,800-28,200 mg/kg), neutral pH, and lower C/N ratios (13:1-10:1), which were also comparable with commercially produced composts. Filter materials therefore, appears to be a vital ingredient for composting of winery solid waste. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The immune status of Nile tilapia is affected by thermal fluctuation throughout the hatching season reflected by altered yolk sac size, length, and expression of the immune and stress related genes of the larvae, the best performances was observed at the beginning of the hatching season (March). High temperature (30 degrees C) suppress immune and stress responses throughout downregulation of all the genes under study, mask any effects for the immunostimulants, increased mortality in fish larvae suggesting narrow thermal tolerance range for the larvae compared with the adult fish. We recommend the use of amino acid mix as immunostimulant for Nile tilapia larvae, it reduces the mortality percentage and improve cellular response.

From Fall to Spring the mean meridional gradient of meridional Ekman transport in the Subtropical Convergence Zone (STCZ) enhances the meridional sea surface temperature (T(s)) gradients between 26-degrees and 32-degrees-N. In the presence of this enhanced mean gradient, baroclinic eddies with zonal wavelengths of almost-equal-to 800 km and periods of almost-equal-to 200 days exert the dominant influence on the formation of subtropical fronts at medium and large scales. These eddies generate westward propagating T(s) anomaly features with the same dominant wavelengths and periods. They are confined between 26-degrees and 32-degrees-N and have amplitudes that occasionally exceed +/- 1-degrees-C. T(s) fronts tend to be found within bands almost-equal-to 200 km wide that roughly follow the periphery of these anomaly features. Deformation in the horizontal eddy current field is primarily responsible for the existence of these frontal bands. The migration of the strong front originally bracketed by the FASINEX moored array was related to the westward propagation of the larger-scale eddy/anomaly/frontal-band pattern. The moored array was located within a warm-anomaly feature during most of the experiment, which produced exceptionally warm conditions in the upper ocean. These anomalies are confined between 26-degrees and 32-degrees-N, not only because the relatively large seasonal mean T(sy) there allows horizontal eddy currents to force strong anomalies, but also because the baroclinic eddies with wavelengths of almost-equal-to 800 km and periods of almost-equal-to 200 days are confined to the STCZ. Large meridional variability exists in many properties of the eddy field, much of which can be traced to the influence of the Sargasso Sea mean current field on eddy variability.",,,,,"Halliwell, George/B-3046-2011; Schmitt, Raymond W/B-7451-2011","Halliwell, George/0000-0003-4216-070X; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,MAY 15,1991,96,C5,,,,,8553,8567,,10.1029/91JC00100,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JC00100,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991FM09900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The interplay between dynamic water storage and sap flow is of current interest, but the accuracy of measurement of both variables has come into question. Fluctuations in stem water content may induce inaccuracy in thermal-based measurements of sap flux density because wood thermal properties are dependent on water content. The most widely used thermal method for measuring sap flux density is the thermal dissipation probe (TDP) with continuous heating, which measures the influence of moving sap on the temperature difference between a heated needle and a reference needle vertically separated in the flow stream. The objective of our study was to investigate how diel fluctuations in water content could influence TDP measurements of sap flux density. We analysed the influence of water content on the zero-flow maximum temperature difference, dT (m), which is used as the reference for calculating sap flux density, and present results of a dehydration experiment on cut branch segments of American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis L.). We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that dT (m) increases when stem water content declines. Because dT (m) is measured at night when water content is high, this phenomenon could result in underestimations of sap flux density during the day when water content is lower. We conclude that diel dynamics in water content should be considered when TDP is used to measure sap flow.",,,,,"McGuire, Mary Anne/A-8089-2008","McGuire, Mary Anne/0000-0002-9629-524X; Steppe, Kathy/0000-0001-6252-0704",,,,,,,,,,,,,0931-1890,1432-2285,,,,JUN,2014,28,3,,,,,949,955,,10.1007/s00468-014-0989-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-014-0989-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000336270400027,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to reduce the growth variability of the soft parts of the bivalve, an intensive fattening process was developed, where the conditions of temperature, particulate organic and inorganic matter (POM and PIM) are controlled. This process relies on the production of the diatom Skeletonema costatum, which is then distributed to the oysters at an average concentration of 4-5 mg POM.L-1. An ecophysiological model of the oyster C. gigas, which simulates the evolution of somatic and gonad-reserve compartments, was applied to these conditions in order to analyse the bivalve responses. Experimentation was performed to elaborate the model and two functions were studied: clearance rate and pseudofecal production. At a temperature of 14 degreesC, chosen for the fattening process, and at POM and PIM concentrations varying respectively from 4 to 18 mg.L-1 and 15 to 55 mg.L-1, it was found that clearance rate was not regulated (mean of 2.09 +/- 0.11 L.h(-1).g(-1) with 59% of activity rate) and that ingestion rate depended on the production of pseudofeces. This production allows an increase of organic ingested fraction, by the mechanism of pre-ingestive selection that buffers the PIM variability. Negative effects of PIM on growth have been studied through several simulations. It appears that actual POM ration (4-5 mg.L-1) used in the fattening process, allows dry tissues growth, in spite of simulated PIM concentration up to 50 mg.L-1. The elaboration of the model revealed that gametogenesis is a major determinant in bivalve energy partitioning in the rich food conditions of this fattening process.

The relatively cool sea-surface temperatures found west of Peru and northern Chile are believed to play a role in maintaining the stratus clouds over the region. In October 2000 a buoy was deployed at 20S, 85W, a site near the center of the stratus region, in order to examine the variability of sea-surface temperature and the temporal evolution of the vertical structure of the upper ocean. The buoy was well-instrumented and obtained accurate time series of the surface forcing as well as time series in the upper ocean of temperature, salinity, and velocity. The variability and the extent to which local forcing explains the temporal evolution of upper ocean structure and heat content was examined. The sources of heating (primarily surface fluxes with weaker contributions from Ekman convergence and transport) are found to be balanced by cooling from the gyre-scale circulation, an eddy flux divergence and vertical diffusion. The deduced eddy flux divergence term is bounded away from zero and represents an order one source of cooling (and freshening). We postulate that the eddy flux divergence represents the effect of the cold coherent eddies formed near the coast, which propagate westward and slowly decay. Direct advection of coastal upwelled water by Ekman transport is negligible. Thus the upwelled water does influence the offshore structure, but through the fluctuating mesoscale flow not the mean transport.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2402,,,,,SEP,2007,65,5,,,,,607,637,,10.1357/002224007783649510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1357/002224007783649510,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000253550100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

At water temperatures around 11degreesC we found that less than 8% of the trout stranded during night experiments (on average for all subsets at dewatering rate >60cm h(-1)). However, the highest stranding rate occurred at water temperatures around 7degreesC during rapid dewatering at night (mean 22% stranding). Significantly more fry were stranded in the first versus the second to fifth dewatering episode (mean 22% versus 10% stranding) at rapid daytime dewatering in 11degreesC water. Stranding of larger fry (>0 +) was negligible at water temperatures around 11degreesC, except at rapid dewatering during daylight. Further, twice as many 0 + trout as larger fry (>70 mm in June, >60 mm in late summer) stranded during rapid dewatering during daytime, and almost three times as many 0+ stranded during rapid dewatering when they were mixed with trout parr compared to homogeneous 0+ experiments. Our study showed a tendency towards an increased stranding of fry with long habituation time (<30 hours versus >30 hours with stable flow). We recommend dewatering in darkness at all times of year to reduce stranding of salmonids, and to use slow ramping rates <10 cm h(-1.) After longer periods with stable flows, a gentle drop in discharge is recommended, which might also reduce stress and possible sub-lethal effects.

Water mulches due to their high specific heat capacity act as a heat sink during the day and heat source at the night. The water mulch restricts energy loss by absorbing all the long wave radiation from the soil and reradiating at a lower temperature. Therefore the effect is a dampening of the diurnal fluctuations of soil temperature. Water mulch provided a favourable micro-climate and conducive soil physical environment for a longer period by altering the bulk density, aeration (non- capillary) porosity, O.D.R. and soil temperature. The yield of peanuts was also higher because it facilitated the entry of pegs into the soil for pod formation between the polyethylene envelops, which are generally restricted by other soil covers and in hard bare soil.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-1857,,,,,MAY-AUG,1998,42,3-4,,,,,126,134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000078961900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, CDSF's natural ventilation performance is barely known, as most current studies investigate planar DSF (PDSF). This paper experimentally evaluated the thermal performance of a reduced scale CDSF model. Experimental results show that CDSF can form natural ventilation by buoyancy, however, with significant discrepancies in the distribution of solar irradiances on the curved surface. Observed nonuniformity shows 30.05 % on average vertically and 9.12 % on average horizontally. The thermal pressures vary at different horizontal positions with a fluctuation range between 0.056 Pa and 0.063 Pa, indicating the influence of gradients and the existence of transverse flows and heat transfers in the cavity. Moreover, the effects of solar irradiation and outdoor air temperature on the CDSF are discussed. The results show that solar irradiation is the main influencing factor on the thermal performance of a CDSF, which are correlated with air velocities in the form of power functions. The influence of solar irradiation on CDSF is similar to that of PDSFs, but CDSF exhibits a bigger exponent. In comparison, outdoor air temperature shows very limited effects, and the influence of outdoor air temperature on CDSF is similar to that of PDSF. For the analyzed CDSF, the thermal pressures only fluctuate from 0.053 Pa to 0.055 Pa when the outdoor air temperature raises from 24 degrees C to 36 degrees C. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Temperature and humidity play a significant role in gum production; even varying climatic parameters have significant impact on overall gum production in babul (Acacia nilotica) tree. Thus, we have tried to explore the impacts of environmental variables on ethephon induced gum production. This study involved a scientific basis of gum tapping technique using two varying concentrations of ethephon concentrations (15.6 or 62.4 mg/tree), 02 levels of girth classes (>= 30.1 to <= 50.0 cm and >= 50.1 cm), 02 levels of holes/injuries (single and double) and 03 levels of season (rainy, winter and summer) on yield potentials of babul in Chhattisgarh. In this experiment, we have reported much fluctuation in environmental variables and analyzed their impacts on ethephon induced gum productions. The gum exudation rate was maximum (97.5 mg/tree/day) in November followed by 83.8 and 71.0 mg/tree/day in October and September during rainy season which reflects increase in gum production with relative lowering of the relative humidity. Similar trends of impacts were seen in winter and summer seasons. The gummosis process was correlated positively with temperature, while the same was correlated negatively with relative humidity, thus both having their respective effects significantly in opposite directions. The rate of gum exudation (RGE) was observed to be in the order of summer (137.10 mg/tree/day) > rainy (84.10 mg/tree/day) > winter (70.63 mg/tree/day). Gum exudation rate increases with increasing concentrations of ethephon from 15.6 to 62.4 mg/tree, number of injury from single to double and girth class of tree.

J,"McGowan, S; Leavitt, PR; Hall, RI",,,,"McGowan, S; Leavitt, PR; Hall, RI",,,A whole-lake experiment to determine the effects of winter droughts on shallow lakes,ECOSYSTEMS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lake-level fluctuations are common in the North American Great Plains region, where large-scale climate systems (El Nino, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and periodic droughts cause substantial hydrologic variability in both summer and winter. To date, most such research has focused on the effects of summer droughts on prairie lake ecosystems; therefore, we studied the impact of water-level decline during winter on ecosystem structure and function. Specifically, we hypothesized that lower lake levels during winter would increase anoxia, freezing and scouring of benthos, fish kills, herbivory by zooplankton, and nutrient release from sediments. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that winter droughts may initiate a switch between alternative stable states (turbid, clear). Physical, chemical, and biological variables were monitored from 1996 to 2001 in both Wascana Lake, which experienced a 50% decline in lake level, and Buffalo Pound Lake, where water levels were constant. A combination of before-after-control-impact (BACI) and multivariate analyses showed that drawdown resulted in elevated NH4-N concentrations following reinundation; otherwise there were few detectable effects on lake water chemistry (PO4-P, NO3-N, total dissolved nitrogen, total dissolved carbon) or pelagic food web structure (phytoplankton, zooplankton), and the experimental lake remained in a macrophyte-rich state. There was, however, a 2.5-fold increase in macrophyte abundance and a shift from a community dominated by Ceratophyllum demersum before drawdown to one composed of Potamogeton pectinatus after manipulation. Overall, the lack of substantial dewatering effects suggests that lakes of the northern Great Plains may be resilient to severe winter conditions, possibly because of the recruitment of fish from regional metapopulations during summer.

P.",,,Numerical simulation of ice-ocean variability in the Barents Sea region Towards dynamical downscaling,OCEAN DYNAMICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"A dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model has been coupled to a three-dimensional ocean general circulation model for the purpose of conducting ocean climate dynamical downscaling experiments for the Barents Sea region. To assess model performance and suitability for such an application, the coupled model has been used to conduct a hindcast for the period 1990-2002. A comparison with available observations shows that the model successfully tracks seasonal and inter-annual variability in the ocean temperature field and that the simulated horizontal and vertical distribution of temperature are in good agreement with observations. The model results follow the seasonal and inter-annual variability in sea ice cover in the region, with the exception that the model results show too much ice melting in the northern Barents Sea during summer. The spatial distribution of the winter simulated sea ice cover is in close agreement with observations. Modelled temperatures and ice concentrations in the central Barents Sea are biased too high and too low, respectively. The probable cause is too high inflow of Atlantic Water into the Barents. The seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in temperature and sea ice cover in the central Barents are, however, in excellent agreement with observations. Salt release during the freezing process in the numerical simulation exhibits considerable inter-annual variability and tends to vary in an opposite manner to the net inflow volume flux at the western entrance of the Barents Sea. Overall, the model produces realistic ice-ocean seasonal and inter-annual variability and should prove to be a useful tool for dynamical downscaling applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1616-7341,,,,,DEC,2005,55,3-4,,,,,370,387,,10.1007/s10236-005-0008-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-005-0008-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000208108200011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using regional ocean model sensitivity experiments, we track equatorially-forced CTW down to the Southern Benguela Upwelling System (SBUS), where they account for 70% of the coastal sea level anomalies (SLA), temperature, and salinity variability. We then decompose the model coastal variability into individual CTW modal contributions and identify periods of energetic downwelling and upwelling propagations. A composite analysis allows for documenting and quantifying the oceanic response (circulation, temperature, and salinity) on the shelf during the passage of remotely-forced CTW. Results reveal that North of similar to 19 degrees S, the coastal interannual variability is dominated by the second and third CTW modes. In the BUS, their amplitudes decrease and the interannual fluctuations are largely explained ( > 70%) by the faster and weakly-dissipative first CTW mode. This dynamic explains the peculiar propagative pattern associated with SLA propagations, in which equatorially-forced fluctuations in the SBUS peak before the waves imprint the variability at similar to 19 degrees S. The impact of CTW on the temperature in the SBUS is drastically lower than in the NBUS and Angolan regions. At last, we show that 71% of the extreme Benguela Nino and Nina events, in the surface layer, are associated with remotely-forced CTW propagations.

It was determined that a increasing in the storage temperature decreased Na, Mg, Mn, and Zn contents of the seeds. The storage at 20 degrees C and room conditions caused a decrease in L*, a*, b* and Chroma. Although moisture content fluctuated throughout storage period, it increased at the end of storage period. The best mineral and technological properties of einkorn wheat seeds were obtained with 4 degrees C storage. This temperature was followed by 10 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and room conditions, respectively. Practical applications Einkorn wheat are one of the consumed wheats in the world and their quality for consumption is directly related to by storage conditions that alter mineral composition, color, and technological properties. Therefore, this study seeks to present a practical and viable solution for farmers of einkorn wheat so that they can store these grains for long periods, maintaining the quality standards for commercialization.

This paper describes an empirical method that aims to improve our understanding of the performance of benthic filter feeders experiencing changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature, on time scales of minutes to hours, especially during daily cycles or extreme events such as marine heatwaves or hypoxic upwelling. We describe the Fluorometer and Oximeter equipped Flow-through Setup (FOFS), experimental design, and methodological protocols to evaluate the flood of data, enabling researchers to monitor important energy budget traits, including filtration and respiration of benthic filter-feeders in response to fine-tuned environmental variability. FOFS allows online recording of deviations in chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen concentrations induced by the study organism. Transparent data processing through Python scripts provides the possibility to adjust procedures to needs when working in different environmental contexts (e.g., temperature vs. pH, salinity, oxygen, biological cues) and with different filter-feeding species. We successfully demonstrate the functionality of the method through recording responses of Baltic Sea blue mussels (Mytilus) during one-day thermal cycles. This method practically provides a tool to help researchers exposing organisms to environmental variability for some weeks or months, to relate the observed long-term performance responses to short-term energy budget responses, and to explain their findings with the potential to generalize patterns.

Yet, spatiotemporal variability in energy expenditure has rarely been explored in fully aquatic species such as fish. Our objective was to quantify spatially explicit energy expenditure for a tropical marine teleost fish, bonefish (Albula vulpes), to examine how bonefish energetics vary across landscape features and temporal factors. Using a swim tunnel respirometer, we calibrated acoustic accelerometer transmitters implanted in bonefish to estimate their metabolic rates and energy expenditure, and applied this technology in situ using a fine-scale telemetry system on a heterogeneous reef flat in Puerto Rico. Bonefish energy expenditure varied most among habitats, with significant interactions between habitat and temporal factors (i.e., diel period, tide state, season). The energy expenditure was generally highest in shallow water habitats (i.e., seagrass and reef crest). Variation in activity levels was the main driver of these differences in energy expenditure, which in shallow, nearshore habitats is likely related to foraging. Bonefish moderate energy expenditure across seasonal fluctuations in temperature, by selectively using shallow nearshore habitats at moderate water temperatures that correspond with their scope for activity. Quantifying how animals expend energy in association with environmental and ecological factors can provide important insight into behavioral ecology, with implications for bioenergetics models.",,,,,"Cooke, Steven J/F-4193-2010","Cooke, Steven J/0000-0002-5407-0659",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,,2017,183,3,,,,,689,699,,10.1007/s00442-016-3800-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-016-3800-5,,,,,,,,28093608,,,,,WOS:000411577400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Microwave brightness temperatures of snow at 19 and 37 GHz for six different classes of snow (prairie, tundra, taiga, alpine, maritime, and ephemeral) are simulated by means of four different electromagnetic models: the Helsinki University of Technology snow emission model, the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks, a dense-medium radiative-transfer theory model, and a strong fluctuation theory model. The frequency behavior of the extinction coefficients obtained with the different models between 5 and 90 GHz is also studied. The four models are also driven with inputs derived from snow-pit data, and the outputs are compared with ground-based measurements of brightness temperatures at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz. Significant differences among the brightness temperatures and the extinction coefficients simulated with the four models in the cases of the six classes of snow are observed. Moreover, no particular model is found to be able to systematically reproduce all of the experimental data.

In this study, an experimental approach was used to investigate hydropeaking effects and associated hydraulic and habitat conditions on the home range and movement of juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. Prior studies examined the responses of Atlantic salmon and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis to experimental hydropeaking during summer and autumn. The present study focused on Atlantic salmon, involved more rapid and extreme discharge manipulation, and included winter experiments to reflect influences of reduced temperature, ice conditions, and seasonal differences in behavior and habitat selection. Experiments were conducted over a range in discharge (0.5-5.0 m(3)/s) that resulted in dramatic habitat changes in the wide, shallow, boulder-strewn study reach. Experiments were repeated in summer and winter; however, the winter range in discharge was narrower due to constraints on water release. Fish response was monitored using manual telemetry in both seasons, and fixed telemetry was used to monitor fine-scale diet winter movements. Atlantic salmon had larger home ranges and were more mobile during all flow conditions and over diet cycles in summer than in winter, and there was anecdotal evidence of stranding in isolated pools in summer. Stream morphology, in addition to the magnitude of discharge change, was an important determinant of the propensity to move. In our study, there were considerable refugia from increased velocity and dewatering, which may have reduced the need to move. In winter, fish remained relatively sedentary in comparison with the summer foraging period, and this behavior may increase the likelihood for dewatering, stranding, and freezing. A secondary concern with hydropeaking regimes is the energetic cost to fish of moving to find suitable habitats, and during summer this cost could affect stored energy reserves, which could, in turn, affect overwinter survival.",,,,,"Clarke, Keith/L-8641-2019; Robertson, Martha/B-5031-2009","Clarke, Keith/0000-0001-5805-6056; Harby, Atle/0000-0002-4965-6970",,,,,,,,,,,,,0275-5947,,,,,AUG,2005,25,3,,,,,964,974,,10.1577/M04-133.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-133.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000231336800022,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the timing of bud break correlated with the sum of effective temperatures, the beginning of cambial zone activity did not. The needles were fully unfolded around DOY 170, which corresponded to the transition between earlywood and latewood tracheids. Summer drought did not affect needle development, but it changed the rate of production and morphology of latewood tracheids. Latewood tracheids from the year 2015 when the drought was longest (i.e. until the second half of August in 2015 compared to the duration from June until the middle of July in the two other years) were 32% narrower and they had 34% thinner cell walls than in 2014 and 2016.

The nearshore carbonate chemistry is under-characterized and the physiology of local organisms may be under constant challenge from cyclical changes in pH and carbonate ion concentration of unexpectedly high magnitude. We looked to environmental pH conditions of coastal upwelling and used those values to examine effects of low pH on 4-arm larvae of purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. We deployed a pH sensor at a nearshore shallow benthic site for 3 weeks during summer 2010 to assess the changes in pH in the Santa Barbara Channel, a region considered to have relatively less intense upwelling along the US Pacific Coast. Large fluctuations in pH of up to 0.67 pH units were observed over short time scales of several days. Daily pH fluctuations on a tidal pattern followed temperature fluctuations over short time scales, but not over scales greater than a day. The lowest pH values recorded (similar to 7.70) are lower than some of those pH values predicted to occur in surface oceans at the end of the century. In the context of this dynamic pH exposure, larvae were raised at elevated pCO(2) levels of 1000 ppm and 1450 ppm CO2 (pH 7.7 and 7.5 respectively) and measured for total larval length (from the spicule tip of the postoral arm to the spicule tip of the aboral point) along the spicules, to assess effects of low pH upwelling water on morphology. Larvae in all treatments maintained normal development and developmental schedule to day 6, and did not exhibit significant differences in larval asymmetry between treatments. At day 3 and day 6, larvae in the 1450 ppm CO2 treatment were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the control larvae by only 7-13%. The observation of smaller larvae raised under high pCO(2) has an as yet undetermined physiological mechanism, but has implications for locomotion and feeding. These effects of small magnitude in these urchin larvae are indicative of a potential resilience to near-future levels of ocean acidification.

The sensitivity of full-canopy-cover crop coefficients (K(c)) to variations in solar radiation, air temperature, air vapor density and wind speed was investigated using an energy balance model. Interpretation of the sensitivity involved analyzing the components of the energy balance, which varied as a result of differences in aerodynamic and canopy resistance between the reference crop and the crop to be irrigated. Instability of crop coefficients was shown to increase with decreasing crop canopy resistance and with increasing crop height, indicating that the expectation of universal validity for basal or full-canopy-cover coefficients is not fulfilled. For crops taller and/or with lower canopy resistance than the short clipped grass (0.1 m) used as reference, the magnitude of K(c) fluctuations with changes in weather elements suggests caution when using K(c) values under environmental conditions different from those prevailing at the site where they were experimentally derived. Values of K(c) derived for crops whose height and canopy resistance are not too different from the reference are more stable across environments. Thus, full-cover alfalfa (0.5-m height) would be a better reference crop choice than a short clipped grass (0.1 m) because its canopy resistance and roughness better approximate those of most crops.

We estimated-assuming a continuously monitorable simplified axial ray propagation-the signal-to-noise ratio for such an experiment in an environment of slow fluctuations of the thermohaline circulation on a decadal time scale. The signal and noise are obtained from two coarse-resolution ocean general circulation model simulations. In the first, prescribed greenhouse atmospheric anomalies forced the ocean and yielded rough estimates of ocean response to greenhouse warming. In the second, some aspects of low-frequency internal variability of the ocean were obtained by stochastic forcing of the same ocean model. By this technique, no oscillations of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system like, for instance, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) could be stimulated. Both signal and internal variability proved to be strongest at high latitudes, where the depth of the sound channel is small. At lower latitudes the signal is relatively weak, except for the western Atlantic. An array with an acoustic source near Heard Island would monitor primarily temperature changes in the near-surface layers of the Southern Ocean rather than in low-latitude intermediate depths. The trend detection probability for any single path came out to be weak, at least for a one-decade measuring interval. But using information from at least a two-decade interval and an array of receivers improved the detection probabilities substantially. Two different pattern detection strategies were tested: projecting the natural variability on the expected greenhouse signal and projecting the greenhouse signal onto the major components of the natural variability. Both techniques proved to give almost identical results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,,,,,JUN,1993,23,6,,,,,1099,1109,,10.1175/1520-0485(1993)023<1099:ADOGIC>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(1993)023<1099:ADOGIC>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LJ37700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Water level treatments may affect its overwintering and regrowth capability during warming winter. To test this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of different water levels on the survival rates and regrowth of E. crassipes under experimental warm winter conditions. Three water levels were set up including drawdown with rooted, shallow submergence with rooted and floating. Regrowth characters including number of ramets, Fv/Fm, biomass and biomass allocation were surveyed. The results showed that warming significantly increased survival, ramet numbers and the biomass of plants. Warming also significantly increased Fv/Fm in drawdown plants. Water level only impacted plants under warming conditions. Compared to floating plants, drawdown significantly decreased survival but increased total biomass, while submergence led to 100 % survival, significantly higher ramet numbers and increased total biomass. In terms of biomass allocation, the effects of warming were similar for drawdown and submergence cases; it resulted in increased shoot biomass allocation and a lower root mass ratio. Warming only significantly increased the stem mass ratio of floating plants. Our findings suggested that warming help E. crassipes successfully overwinter and regrow during the next growing season. Drawdown or shallow submergence cannot effectively control this species but rather promotes its regrowth during warm winters.

Similarities between the spatial patterns of the cold surface layer, net mass balance and emergence velocity together with modelled high sensitivity to variations in emergence velocities suggest that the net ablation and vertical ice advection are the dominant forcing parameters. Results from transient model experiments suggest that the cold surface layer reaches a new equilibrium after a perturbation in the forcing within a few decades. No significant change in ice flow or mass balance has been observed at Storglaciaren in recent decades. Instead, art increase of VC in winter air temperature since the mid-1980s is probably the cause of the observed thinning of the cold surface layer. Increased winter temperatures at the ice surface result in a reduced formation rate of cold ice at the base of the cold surface layer and lead to a larger imbalance between net loss of ice at the surface and freezing of temperate ice at the cold-temperate transition surface. Model results indicate that the cold surface layer is more sensitive to changes in ice surface temperature in areas with lower emergence velocity, which explains the observed complex thinning pattern of the cold surface layer.",,,,,"Jansson, Peter/B-5761-2012; Huwald, Hendrik/S-3688-2019; Huwald, Hendrik/C-1746-2012","Jansson, Peter/0000-0002-8832-8806; Huwald, Hendrik/0000-0003-3769-7342; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1430,1727-5652,,,,,2007,53,180,,,,,99,109,,10.3189/172756507781833974,http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756507781833974,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000246007900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study was to understand the seed ecology of these species by focusing on the prominent, yet intractably dormant Australian genus Hibbertia. It was hypothesized that the slow germination in species of this genus is caused by a requirement for embryo growth inside the seed before germination, and that initiation of embryo growth is reliant upon a complex sequence of environmental cues including seasonal fluctuations in temperature and moisture, and an interplay with light and smoke. Using the results, the classification of the MPD level in species of Hibbertia is considered. Four species of Hibbertia in winter rainfall south-western Australia were selected. These species, whilst differing in geographic distributions, are variously sympatric, and all are important understorey components of plant communities. The following aspects related to dormancy break, embryo growth and germination were investigated: temperature and moisture requirements; effects of karrikinolide, gibberellic acid and aerosol smoke; and phenology. Following exposure to wet/dry cycles at low or high temperatures, embryo growth and germination occurred, albeit slowly in all species at low temperatures when moisture was unlimited, corresponding to winter in south-west Australia. Photo regime influenced germination only in H. racemosa. Aerosol smoke triggered substantial germination during the 1st germination season in H. huegelii and H. hypericoides. Although the study species are con-generic, sympatric and produce seeds of identical morphology, they possessed different dormancy-break and germination requirements. The physiological component of MPD was non-deep in H. racemosa but varied in the other three species where more deeply dormant seeds required 1 summer to overcome dormancy and, thus, germination was spread over time. Embryos grew during winter, but future studies need to resolve the role of cold versus warm stratification by using constant temperature regimes. To include Mediterranean species with MPD, some modifications to the current seed-dormancy classification system may need consideration: (a) wet/dry conditions for warm stratification and (b) a relatively long period for warm stratification. These outcomes have important implications for improving experimental approaches to resolve the effective use of broadcast seed for ecological restoration.",,,,,"Merritt, David J/G-9376-2011; Turner, David W/C-2441-2013; Dixon, Kingsley W/B-1042-2011; dixon, kingsley wayne/A-8133-2016; Turner, Shane R/A-9950-2011; Turner, David/AAA-9722-2019","Merritt, David J/0000-0002-3250-6861; dixon, kingsley wayne/0000-0001-5989-2929; Turner, David/0000-0002-0117-2926; Hidayati, Siti Nur/0000-0001-6979-8477",,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,,,,,MAY,2012,109,6,,,,,1111,1123,,10.1093/aob/mcs034,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs034,,,,,,,,22362661,,,,,WOS:000303335800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, to our knowledge, the genetic influence on the frequency and type of IADFs has not been evaluated. To understand if the genotype can affect the formation of IADFs we have used a common garden experiment using eight families of Larix decidua established in two neighboring forest stands in northern Poland. Four types of IADFs were identified using X-ray density profiles: latewood-like cells within earlywood (IADF-type E), latewood-like cells in the transition from early-to latewood (IADF type E+), earlywood-like cells within latewood (IADF-type L), and earlywood-like cells in the border zone between the previous and present annual ring (IADF-type L+). The influence of explanatory variables i.e., families, sites, and years on identified density fluctuations was analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). We hypothesized that trees from different families will differ in terms of frequency and type of IADFs because each family will react to precipitation and temperature in a different way, depending on the origin of those trees. The most frequent fluctuation was E+ and L types on both sites. The most important factors in the formation of IADFs were the site and year, the last one reflecting the variable climatic conditions, with no significant effect of the family. However, the relation between the formation of IADFs and selected climate parameters was different between families. Although, our results did not give a significant effect of the genotype on the formation of IADFs, the different sensitivity to climatic parameters among different families indicate that there is a genetic influence.",,,,,"Klisz, Marcin/J-8468-2019; Koprowski, Marcin/M-2706-2019; Koprowski, Marcin/A-2863-2014","Klisz, Marcin/0000-0001-9486-6988; Koprowski, Marcin/0000-0002-0583-4165; Koprowski, Marcin/0000-0002-0583-4165; Nabais, Cristina/0000-0001-6901-8776; Ukalska, Joanna/0000-0002-4793-8886",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-462X,,,,,MAY 20,2016,7,,,,,,,,697,10.3389/fpls.2016.00691,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2016.00691,,,,,,,,27242883,,,,,WOS:000376152900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Acid production from nitrification was a necessary model input. In the surface horizon, the model gave a good prediction of base cation concentrations and their time trends, provided the weathering rate was set at about 250 mEq.m-2 year-1. However, the predicted pH and Al were far too high: this probably shows that the Al(OH)3 control used in the model was inappropriate. At the base of the profile, pH and Al were modelled more satisfactorily but fluctuations in anion and base cation concentrations were out of phase from those predicted. This was because the model assumes instantaneous reaction throughout the soil profile whereas in reality downward transport takes a significant time. As the AI(OH)3 solubility constant in the model was not temperature-dependent, MAGIC failed to predict the small annual fluctuation in Al concentration in the lower horizons. Because of the incorrect Al and H+ modelling in the surface horizons, and possibly because vertical variation in selectivity coefficients was not accounted for, the model predicted a much larger decrease in soil base saturation than was actually observed. Soil processes in the MAGIC model appear to have been well chosen and modelled responses could all be observed in the experimental data. The model gave a good qualitative prediction of the experimental data and could be adjusted to give a reasonable quantitative prediction for many variables. In the surface horizon, however, and by extension in other soils with a dominating organic matter component, the Al(OH)3 control used was inappropriate and could lead to misleading results.",,,,,,"Skeffington, Richard/0000-0002-4838-9030",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1694,,,,,APR,1993,144,1-4,,,,,247,272,,10.1016/0022-1694(93)90174-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(93)90174-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993KV20000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results showed that, in control treatment, diurnal course of photosynthetic rate (A), transpiration rate (E) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) was bimodal, showing clear midday depression. In stress treatment, the diurnal dynamics of A exhibited an atypical double-peaked pattern, whereas the diurnal change in E and g(s) presented a single-peaked curve. A positive and significant correlation between A and g(s) was observed in well-watered as well as in drought stressed plants, whereas intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) increased with decreasing A rate. Therefore, we might assume that in both treatments die largest part of the reduction in photosynthesis was caused by stomatal closure; however, this finding does not preclude the existence of alternative mechanisms that may also have affected photosynthesis. The diurnal dynamics of instantaneous water use efficiency (WUE) exhibited maximum values in the early morning, afterwards it decreased during late morning and throughout the afternoon with the decline being greater in the stressed than in the control plants. Comparing to the control, the plants subjected to permanent water deficit have increased intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) during the early morning, pointing out on minimized loss of water per fixed CO2.

In cool climates, however, both cover crop biomass production and soil temperature can be limiting for organic no-till. In addition, successful termination of cover crops can be a challenge, particularly when cover crops are grown as mixtures. We tested whether reusable plastic tarps, an increasingly popular tool for small-scale vegetable farmers, could be used to augment organic no-till cover crop termination and weed suppression. We no-till transplanted cabbage into a winter rye (Secale cerealeL.)-hairy vetch (Vicia villosaRoth) cover crop mulch that was terminated with either a roller-crimper alone or a roller-crimper plus black or clear tarps. Tarps were applied for durations of 2, 4 and 5 weeks. Across tarp durations, black tarps increased the mean cabbage head weight by 58% compared with the no tarp treatment. This was likely due to a combination of improved weed suppression and nutrient availability. Although soil nutrients and biological activity were not directly measured, remaining cover crop mulch in the black tarp treatments was reduced by more than 1100 kg ha(-1)when tarps were removed compared with clear and no tarp treatments. We interpret this as an indirect measurement of biological activity perhaps accelerated by lower daily soil temperature fluctuations and more constant volumetric water content under black tarps. The edges of both tarp types were held down, rather than buried, but moisture losses from the clear tarps were greater and this may have affected the efficacy of clear tarps. Plastic tarps effectively killed the vetch cover crop, whereas it readily regrew in the crimped but uncovered plots. However, emergence of large and smooth crabgrass (Digitariaspp.) appeared to be enhanced in the clear tarp treatment. Although this experiment was limited to a single site-year in New Hampshire, it shows that use of black tarps can overcome some of the obstacles to implementing cover crop-based no-till vegetable productions in northern climates.",,,,,,"Smith, Richard G./0000-0002-3571-5888; Lounsbury, Natalie/0000-0002-0482-7887",,,,,,,,,,,,,1742-1705,1742-1713,,,,JUN,2020,35,3,,,,,227,233,PII S1742170518000509,10.1017/S1742170518000509,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1742170518000509,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000577525000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed T-b to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest- phase T-b. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during reproduction (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both reproductive and non- reproductive greater hedgehog tenrecs (Setifer setosus), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest metabolic rates and highest levels of T-b variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in metabolism and Tb below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in T-b variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at similar to 25 degrees C. However, whereas increases in resting metabolism were substantial below 20 degrees C (up to 150% higher during reproduction), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, S. setosus provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young.

For reef-building corals, understanding the relative roles of acclimatization and adaptation in generating thermal tolerance is fundamental to predicting the response of coral populations to future climate change. The temperature mosaic in the lagoon of Ofu, American Samoa, represents an ideal natural laboratory for studying thermal tolerance in corals. Two adjacent back-reef pools approximately 500m apart have different temperature profiles: the highly variable (HV) pool experiences temperatures that range from 24.5 to 35 degrees C, whereas the moderately variable (MV) pool ranges from 25 to 32 degrees C. Standardized heat stress tests have shown that corals native to the HV pool have consistently higher levels of bleaching resistance than those in the MV pool. In this review, we summarize research into the mechanisms underlying this variation in bleaching resistance, focusing on the important reef-building genus Acropora. Both acclimatization and adaptation occur strongly and define thermal tolerance differences between pools. Most individual corals shift physiology to become more heat resistant when moved into the warmer pool. Lab based tests show that these shifts begin in as little as a week and are equally sparked by exposure to periodic high temperatures as constant high temperatures. Transcriptome-wide data on gene expression show that a wide variety of genes are co-regulated in expression modules that change expression after experimental heat stress, after acclimatization, and even after short term environmental fluctuations. Population genetic scans show associations between a corals' thermal environment and its alleles at 100s to 1000s of nuclear genes and no single gene confers strong environmental effects within or between species. Symbionts also tend to differ between pools and species, and the thermal tolerance of a coral is a reflection of individual host genotype and specific symbiont types. We conclude the review by placing this work in the context of parallel research going on in other species, reefs, and ecosystems around the world and into the broader framework of reef coral resilience in the face of climate change.",,,,,,"Lopez-Nandam, Elora H./0000-0002-0338-0892",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,FEB 1,2018,4,,,,,,,,434,10.3389/fmars.2017.00434,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00434,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000456917200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The lack of high-resolution pH observations in EBCSs limits the ability to relate field pH exposures to performance of coastal marine species under future ocean change (acidification, warming). This 3-yr study describes spatio-temporal pH variability across the northern Channel Islands, along a persistent temperature gradient (1-4 degrees C) within the eastern boundary California Current System. pH and Conductivity, Temperature, Depth, and Oxygen sensors were deployed on island piers in eelgrass and kelp habitat and on a subtidal mooring. Due to event-scale primary production, the temperature gradient across the islands did not manifest in a pH gradient. We resolved spatial pH variability on diel (Delta pH(T) 0.05-0.2: photosynthesis), event-scale (Delta pH(T) < 0.1-0.2: upwelling, phytoplankton blooms, wind relaxation), and seasonal (Delta pH(T) 0.06: warming) time frames. In the kelp forest, summer mean pH(T) (8.01-8.02) and magnitude of diel pHT cycles (Delta pH(T) 0.12-0.10) were comparable year-to-year, despite 2.1 degrees C warming from 2012 to 2014. Compared to nearby mainland sites, the northern Channel Islands experienced few low pH events. The majority of pH(T) observations were > 7.9. The lowest pH observations (> 1 SD below mean pH(T)) occurred under either warm (respiration during warm nights) or cold (advection of upwelled water) temperatures.

However, this parasitoid remains largely ignored and is not used in many regions, including the Mediterranean Basin. In this study, the potential of D.longicaudata as a biocontrol agent against the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae) was addressed in an area of eastern Spain (the Valencian community). The parasitic activity of parasitoids and the effects of climatic conditions were evaluated throughout a 1-year period in field-cage experiments in which parasitoids were confined with apples artificially infested with medfly larvae. The following parameters were calculated and related statistically to several environmental conditions: the parasitism rate, the induced mortality and progeny sex ratio. The results show that D.longicaudata is able to parasitize medfly larvae throughout the year under semi-natural conditions. Important fluctuations in the parasitism rate (from almost zero to 42%) and the induced mortality (from 6% to 80%) were partially influenced by climatic conditions. The parasitism rate increased with mean temperature and decreased with mean relative humidity, while the induced mortality decreased with minimum relative humidity. The optimal climatic conditions for the activity of the parasitoid were a mean temperature of 16-24 degrees C combined with a relative humidity of 45%-60%. Overall, these results suggest that reduction in the medfly population due to D.longicaudata activity is feasible and provide information about the optimal time period for parasitoid release in the field.

Among the various agricultural practices evaluated in this study, black plastic mesh groundcovers showed increasing soil moisture availability and temperature, as well as improving plant growth and yields. Raised bed practices have also been used to increase soil drainage and porosity to promote root proliferation in compacted soils. While these practices have been primarily studied on annual or row crops, their introduction into grove systems has been slow, even the positive results obtained with these practices. Citrus are managed very differently from row crops, with long-term practices and management techniques often negatively impacting root growth. Citrus management practices using raised beds and black plastic mesh groundcovers have shown great promise in improving citrus production and tree growth. However, few studies have investigated the impact of these practices on root growth and morphology and how these practices affect aboveground growth and production. In this experiment, we aimed to evaluate how different practices affected root growth and how this, in turn, impacted aboveground parameters. To accomplish this, we examined root distribution and in-growth (root growth inside a hand-made core) in four different citrus grove floor management systems; raised bed with groundcover, raised bed without groundcover, flatbed with groundcover, and flatbed without groundcover at various times throughout the growing season for three years. We then assessed how each treatment parameter affected root characteristics and how this affected the aboveground and soil measurements. Root analysis with WinRhizo (R) software showed significant differences between management systems. Raised beds with black plastic groundcovers increased root growth and density throughout the study. Seasonal ingrowth core data indicated that the period from Fall-Spring showed significantly higher root growth than the Spring-Fall period, indicating seasonal growth and senescence of roots. The Spring-Fall cores were also less influenced by management treatment than the other sampling dates.

Three experiments were conducted to test features of winter mortality. In the first experiment, we varied size and whether food was provided or withheld; temperatures were permitted to follow ambient (New York) wintertime fluctuations. Mortality and depletion of energy reserves were more rapid in the units receiving no food. Small fish died before larger fish in these units, but not in the units receiving food. Energy depletion of fish in the no-food treatment resembled that of fish in the wild. In the second experiment, we varied size and population of origin, representing high-latitude (Nova Scotia), midlatitude (New York), and low-latitude (South Carolina) populations. These fish were provided food and showed minimal depletion of energy reserves, but mortality rates were high when water temperatures were low. Mortality did not vary with size in New York and South Carolina fish, but was highest in intermediate-size fish from Nova Scotia. There was a pronounced population difference in survival rate (Nova Scotia > New York > South Carolina). In the third experiment, food was withheld and extreme low temperatures were moderated. Energy depletion was rapid and small fish died before large fish. We conclude that populations in seasonal environments are likely to be subject to size-selective winter mortality when energy reserves are depleted and that juvenile growth rates have evolved in response to this selection pressure.

The tipping-curve calibration method is a well-established technique for ground-based microwave radiometers measuring at frequencies where the opacity of the atmosphere is low. This method relies on the known relationship between the tipping angles of the radiometer and the atmospheric opacity at those angles. Atmospheric inhomogeneities slightly disturb this relationship and therefore lead to calibration errors. The calibration scheme presented in this paper uses the determined tipping-calibration accuracy and incorporates the statistical behavior of radiometer gain and system-temperature variations in a Kalman filter framework. In this paper, a calibration simulation is set up to test the capability of the proposed scheme by reconstructing simulated brightness temperatures first. Moreover, the technique is applied to experimental data. The calibration quality is evaluated with the detrended-fluctuation-analysis method. Model and experimental results show that the calibration accuracy can be increased by a factor of two or even higher.

We hypothesized that sirtuins (food-dependent protein regulators of cellular homeostasis), which may regulate the cellular stress response of mytilids during heat stress, also affect organismal performance during recovery from heat stress. As part of a broader study, we investigated the effects of acclimation food ration, acclimation emersion (air) temperature, and sirtuin inhibitors on the feeding behavior of the California mussel, Mytilus californianus, during recovery from acute aerial heat shock. Mussels were acclimated for 3 wk. to either a low (0.25% algae.g mussel dry wt(-1)) or high (1.5% algae.g mussel dry wt(-1)) algal ration and low (20 degrees C) or high (30 degrees C) emersion temperatures, in tidal simulator tanks capable of maintaining standard circadian and circatidal rhythms. Following acclimation, mussels were exposed to two sirtuin inhibitors (nicotinamide and suramin) or no inhibitors for one high tide cycle. During the subsequent low tide cycle, all mussels were exposed to an acute aerial heat shock (33 degrees C) and then allowed to recover in their respective acclimation conditions. Every 12 h during the 48 h before sirtuin inhibition and 48 h following acute heat shock (in the corresponding high tide periods), we recorded clearance rates and valve gape activity. Mussels acclimated to a low food ration significantly reduced clearance rates with heat shock and sirtuin inhibition, but not with heat shock alone, relative to pre-treatment values regardless of emersion temperature. Mussels acclimated to a low food ration and high emersion temperature showed significant reductions in valve gape activity following an acute heat shock following sirtuin inhibition, but not in any of the other acclimation groups. Unexpectedly, heat shock alone reduced clearance rates of mussels acclimated to high food and high emersion temperatures only, without any additional effect by heat shock and sirtuin inhibition. Together, these findings suggest an important role for sirtuins at the organismal level during recovery from heat shock following acclimation to a low food ration.",,,,,,"May, Melissa/0000-0002-3235-8475; Feezell, Maya/0000-0002-5095-5548; Gonzalez, Silvano/0000-0001-6420-7391",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,MAR,2021,536,,,,,,,,151510,10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151510,,JAN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000614217600005,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Assmann, KM; Timmermann, R",,,,"Assmann, KM; Timmermann, R",,,Variability of dense water formation in the Ross Sea,OCEAN DYNAMICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"This paper presents results from a model study of the interannual variability of high salinity shelf water (HSSW) properties in the Ross Sea. Salinity and potential temperature of HSSW formed in the western Ross Sea show oscillatory behaviour at periods of 5-6 and 9 years superimposed on long-term fluctuations. While the shorter oscillations are induced by wind variability, variability on the scale of decades appears to be related to air temperature fluctuations. At least part of the strong decrease of HSSW salinities deduced from observations for the period 1963-2000 is shown to be an aliasing artefact due to an undersampling of the periodic signal. While sea ice formation is responsible for the yearly salinity increase that triggers the formation of HSSW, interannual variability of net freezing rates hardly affects changes in the properties of the resulting water mass. Instead, results from model experiments indicate that the interannual variability of dense water characteristics is predominantly controlled by variations in the shelf inflow through a sub-surface salinity and a deep temperature signal. The origin of the variability of inflow characteristics to the Ross Sea continental shelf can be traced into the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. The temperature anomalies are induced at the continental shelf break in the western Bellingshausen Sea by fluctuations of the meridional transport of circumpolar deep water with the eastern cell of the Ross Gyre. In the Amundsen Sea, upwelling due to a persistently cyclonic wind field carries the signal into the surface mixed layer, leading to fluctuations of the vertical heat flux, anomalies of brine release near the sea ice edge, and consequently to a sub-surface salinity anomaly. With the westward flowing coastal current, both the sub-surface salinity and deep temperature signals are advected onto the Ross Sea continental shelf. Convection carries the signal of salinity variability into the deep ocean, where it interacts with modified circumpolar deep water upwelled onto the continental shelf as the second source water mass of HSSW. Sea ice formation on the Ross Sea continental shelf thus drives the vertical propagation of the signal rather than determining the signal itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1616-7341,1616-7228,,,,NOV,2005,55,2,,,,,68,87,,10.1007/s10236-004-0106-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-004-0106-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000232859800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Stone flounder juveniles were collected from both nursery grounds, and one- and two-year-old flounder were caught deeper in Sendai Bay. Sr and Ca content in the otoliths were measured by electron probe micro analysis, The Sr:Ca ratios in the otolith section corresponding to the early postsettlement period ranged from 3.06 to 3.85 for the exposed inshore areas with stable low temperature and high salinity conditions, and from 3.81 to 5.32 in brackish estuaries with high temperature and low salinity conditions hut with large diel and tidal cyclical fluctuations. Values from an estuarine site with stable salinity ranged from 3.58 to 4.15 overlapping with both the above ranges. Rearing experiments supported our inference that the high otolith Sr:Ca ratios of juveniles inhabiting estuarine nursery grounds are attributable to higher temperature and physiological stress caused by the large diel temperature and salinity fluctuations within the estuaries. Estimation of the Sr:Ca ratio of recruited fish using the otolith section formed while in the nursery area showed that at least 20 out of 42 individuals examined originated from estuarine nursery grounds.

Several marine invertebrate species have invaded the U. S. southern and mid-Atlantic coast from the Caribbean and this poleward range expansion has been termed 'Caribbean Creep'. While models have predicted the continued decline of global biodiversity over the next 100 years due to global climate change, few studies have examined the episodic impacts of prolonged cold events that could impact species range expansions. Methodology/Principal Findings: A pronounced cold spell occurred in January 2010 in the U. S. southern and mid-Atlantic coast and resulted in the mortality of several terrestrial and marine species. To experimentally test whether cold-water temperatures may have caused the disappearance of one species of the 'Caribbean Creep' we exposed the non-native crab Petrolisthes armatus to different thermal treatments that mimicked abnormal and severe winter temperatures. Our findings indicate that Petrolisthes armatus cannot tolerate prolonged and extreme cold temperatures (4-6 degrees C) and suggest that aperiodic cold winters may be a critical 'reset' mechanism that will limit the range expansion of other 'Caribbean Creep' species. Conclusions/Significance: We suggest that temperature 'aberrations' such as 'cold snaps' are an important and overlooked part of climate change. These climate fluctuations should be accounted for in future studies and models, particularly with reference to introduced subtropical and tropical species and predictions of both rates of invasion and rates of unidirectional geographic expansion.",,,,,"Canning-Clode, Joao/I-4343-2019; Canning Clode, João/G-5142-2011; Byers, James/AFJ-8413-2022","Canning-Clode, Joao/0000-0003-2143-6535; Canning Clode, João/0000-0003-2143-6535; Byers, James/0000-0001-9240-0287; Fowler, Amy/0000-0003-4876-597X; Ruiz, Gregory/0000-0003-2499-441X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,DEC 28,2011,6,12,,,,,,,e29657,10.1371/journal.pone.0029657,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029657,,,,,,,,22216340,,,,,WOS:000300676300077,View Full Record in Web of Science

We would like to show here that this conclusion is unwarranted. This is because the experiments of Lucchetta were done at different temperatures from those studied in the model. Since in other temperature combinations the model does not produce precise boundaries and there are no systematic trends in these deviations, a comparison to the experiment is not possible. Furthermore, we would like to point out that any correlated bigradient model should also take into account the fluctuations of the bicoid profile within an embryo.

In this study, the application of fuzzy control and PI control algorithms is experimentally studied in a CW constant temperature difference system. The results indicate that the PI control algorithm of the CW system is simple in structure, and it only requires a reasonable PI parameter setting to achieve better control effect with high accuracy, good steady-state performance, and low energy consumption.

The fuzzy control algorithm has better dynamic performance and the adjustment curve is smooth with small fluctuations, although its control accuracy is not high.

Seagrass meadows are expected to benefit from the increased carbon availability which might be used in photosynthesis in a future high CO2 world. The main aim of this study was to examine the effect of elevated pCO(2) on the net photosynthesis of seagrass Zostera marina in a brackish water environment. The short-term mesocosm experiments were conducted in Koiguste Bay (northern part of Gulf of Riga, the Baltic Sea) in June-July 2013 and 2014. As the levels of pCO(2) naturally range from ca. 150 mu atm to well above 1000 mu atm under summer conditions in Koiguste Bay we chose to operate in mesocosms with the pCO(2) levels of ca. 2000, ca. 1000, and ca. 200 mu atm. Additionally, in 2014 the photosynthesis of Z. marina was measured outside of the mesocosm in the natural conditions. In the shallow coastal Baltic Sea seagrass Z. marina lives in a highly variable environment due to seasonality and rapid changes in meteorological conditions. This was demonstrated by the remarkable differences in water temperatures between experimental years of ca. 8 degrees C. Thus, the current study also investigated the effect of elevated pCO(2) in combination with short-term natural fluctuations of environmental factors, i.e., temperature and PAR on the photosynthesis of Z marina.

Here we report how three geographically different populations of Enchytraeus albidus (Germany, Iceland and Svalbard) respond to three temperature treatments - constant thawed (0 degrees C), constant freezing (-5 degrees C) and fluctuating temperature (0 to -5 degrees C) over a period of 42 days. Survival varied between treatments and populations such that enchytraeids from arctic locations had a higher survival following prolonged freeze periods compared with temperate populations. However, enchytraeids from temperate locations had the same survival rate as arctic populations when exposed to repeated freeze-thaw events. Across all populations, metabolic rate decreased markedly in frozen animals (-5 degrees C) compared with thawed controls (0 degrees C). This decrease is likely due to the lower temperature of frozen animals, but also to the transition to the frozen state per se. Animals exposed to repeated freeze-thaw events had an intermediate metabolic rate and freeze-thaw events were not associated with pronounced excess energetic costs. Overwintering under either condition was not associated with a decrease in lipid content; however, during exposure to constant freezing and repeated freeze-thaw events there was a noticeable decrease in carbohydrate stores over time. Thus, animals exposed to constant freezing showed a decrease in glycogen stores, while both glucose and glycogen content decreased over time when the organisms were exposed to repeated freezing. The results therefore suggest that carbohydrate resources are important as a fuel for E. albidus during freezing whereas lipid resources are of marginal importance.",,,,,"Malte, Hans/J-6018-2013; Overgaard, Johannes/I-7493-2013; Overgaard, Johannes/AAA-3922-2022; Holmstrup, Martin/E-8731-2017","Overgaard, Johannes/0000-0002-2851-4551; Holmstrup, Martin/0000-0001-8395-6582",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,NOV,2014,217,21,,,,,3843,3852,,10.1242/jeb.105650,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.105650,,,,,,,,25214492,,,,,WOS:000344866300018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, we know little about the underlying physiological mechanisms that govern how evolutionary history may affect short-term responses to environmental change. We investigated growth rates and carbon uptake related traits at 15 degrees and 22 degrees C and at different times during the microbial growth curve (lag phase, mid and late exponential) of eight novel strains of Ostreococcus sp. (ca. 1 mu m). The strains were isolated from two distinct regions of the Baltic Sea differing in salinity and temperature as well as variability therein from North-East (Bornholm Basin) to South-West (Kiel area). Strains from Kiel area had ca. 10% higher growth rates on average and showed more variation between strains compared to strains from the Bornholm Basin. While biomass increased throughout the experiment in both temperature, CUE (carbon use efficiency, indicative of photosynthetically derived carbon available for growth) was too low to explain positive growth throughout the entire growth curve at 15 degrees C and during the early stages at 22 degrees C. Throughout the growth curve CUE then increased enough to sustain growth, but only at 22 degrees C. Consequently, we then tested whether Ostreococcus use organic carbon to supplement growth when light is not a limiting factor. We show that Ostreococcus qualitatively modulate their potential to grow on organic carbon sources throughout a single growth curve. Based on the differences between CUE and a potential to grow on organic carbon, we postulate a shift in carbon acquisition between inorganic and organic sources in Ostreococcus sp. with potential implications on ecological dynamics within microbial communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,OCT 5,2021,8,,,,,,,,740763,10.3389/fmars.2021.740763,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.740763,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000708216900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we assessed the effects of observed climate variability on different organismal groups (amphibians, insects, mammals, herbaceous plants and reptiles) by estimating the extent to which interannual variation in the annual population growth rates (CV lambda) and the absolute value of the long-term population growth rate (|log lambda|) were associated with short-term climate variability. We used empirical data (>= 20 consecutive years of annual abundances) from 59 wild populations in the Northern Hemisphere, and quantified variabilities in population growth rates and climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation in active and inactive seasons) calculated over four- and eight-year sliding time windows. We observed a positive relationship between the variability of growth rate (CV lambda) and the variability of temperature in the active season at the shorter timescale only. Moreover, |log lambda| was positively associated with the variability of precipitation in the inactive season at both timescales. Otherwise, the direction of the relationships between population dynamics and climate variability (if any) depended largely on the season and organismal group in question. Both CV lambda and |log lambda| correlated negatively with species' lifespan, indicating general differences in population dynamics between short-lived and long-lived species that were not related to climate variability. Our results suggest that although temporal variation in population growth rates and the magnitude of long-term population growth rates are partially associated with short-term interannual climate variability, demographic responses to climate fluctuations might still be population-specific rather than specific to given organismal groups, and driven by other factors than the observed climate variability.",,,,,,"Storkey, Jonathan/0000-0003-1094-8914",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,MAR,2021,130,3,,,,,476,487,,10.1111/oik.07371,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.07371,,JAN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000608566200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The abundance of the yolksac larvae positively correlated with the abundance of eggs, but the abundance of recruits did not significantly correlate with the abundance of yolksac larvae. These results imply that the survival rate during the egg stage is relatively stable, but that the rate during the larval stage is variable. Of the three most recent decades (1980s, 1990s and 2000s), the abundance of recruits was highest in the 1980s. The decrease in the abundance of recruits after the 1990s can be considered to have occurred through a decline in survival rate during the larval stage because there were no significant differences in egg abundance, yolksac larval abundance, and survival rates during the egg stage in the three decades of the study period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0919-9268,1444-2906,,,,JUL,2012,78,4,,,,,753,760,,10.1007/s12562-012-0498-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-012-0498-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000306123200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An exponential increase in mortality with low temperatures occurs. Chilling tolerance (T-ch) at 4 or 0 degrees C was 6.3 days or 37.91 h for 50% survival (LT(50)), respectively, while the cold-shock tolerance (LT(50) of T-cs) at -7 degrees C was only 1.5 h. The increase in cold-shock tolerance (T-cs) at -7 degrees C by acclimation at 4, or 0 degrees C was rapid: the LT(50) increased about 50% with only 2 h of treatment in comparison with the highest LT(50) obtained by acclimation. An equilibrium point (T-eq), the optimal acclimation time for maximal survival of chilling and/or cold-shock, was calculated from the survival data of experiments designed to assess T-ch and T-cs The T-eq was found to be the half time of the acclimation period which resulted in 90% mortality at the chilling temperature (LT(90) of T-ch). Selection for tolerance to cold-shock or chilling over several generations resulted in a significant increase in T-cs or T-ch, respectively. Higher contents of glycogen and total proteins were observed in the cold selected lines than in the control line. Exposure to chilling temperatures eventually depleted the energy reserves, but the highest concentrations of triacylglycerols and proteins were observed at the acclimation time with the highest T-cs. This suggests that systemic regulation in these energetic reserves may be an important part of the cold-hardening mechanisms to cope with the fluctuations of low temperatures causing cold-shock or chilling injury.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1910,,,,,AUG,1994,40,8,,,,,661,669,,10.1016/0022-1910(94)90093-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1910(94)90093-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PC51600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The simulation and design of these systems need to consider the combined impact of thermal and airflow transport behaviors. The numerical solution of such combined thermal airflow problems often employs a segregate and iterative approach. Either the air temperatures in the thermal problem or the air pressures in the airflow problem are solved separately with the other parameter known from a previous iteration. The newly solved parameters are then substituted successively into the other calculation. For highly coupled thermal airflow problems, the segregate method can cause solution fluctuation or even divergence when relaxation factors are not carefully selected to avoid abrupt changes of air parameters in the successive substitution procedure. This article investigated two nonsegregate methods to solve thermal and airflow problems simultaneously. In the fully simultaneous method, air temperatures and pressures for all rooms of a building are solved simultaneously using a single Jacobian matrix. In the semi-simultaneous method, a Jacobian matrix for the air temperature and pressure of one room is solved when air temperatures and pressures of other rooms are kept as constants. The same procedure is then repeated for each room of a building. In both cases, relaxation factors are not required. The simultaneous solution methods are demonstrated for a two-zone building with thermal buoyancy-driven flows and validated for an experimental study of combined wind and buoyancy forces in a light well. It was shown that the simultaneous solvers provide stable solutions without using any relaxation in both cases. The predicted results also agree reasonably well with the experimental data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1078-9669,,,,,FEB-APR,2012,18,1-2,,,,,264,274,,10.1080/10789669.2011.591258,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10789669.2011.591258,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000301633300021,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, the contributions of climate change to spring maize yield over the past three decades in Northeast China were decoupled based on the daily climate variables gathered from 68 meteorological stations and detailed observed data of spring maize from 55 agricultural meteorological experimental stations for the period 1978-2010 in Northeast China, analyzed with a linear statistical model. Then, the key climatic factors limiting the climate-induced yield of spring maize were identified. The agro-climatic similarity theory was applied. Finally, the relationships between the climatic variables and the climate-induced yield of spring maize were further explored by provinces. The results show that: from 1978 to 2010, the observed yields of spring maize in Northeast China increased markedly, with inter-annual fluctuations. Compared with the methods of moving average and harmonic average, Logistic regression optimally decoupled the climate-induced yield of spring maize. The key meteorological factors limiting the climate-induced yield were temperature, precipitation and sunshine, varying in the different regions. In Heilongjiang Province, the climate-induced yields of spring maize were mainly affected by maximum temperatures in August and precipitation in June. In Jilin Province, climate-induced yield was closely related to precipitation during daily the average temperature stably passing 10 degrees C (>= 10 degrees C). In Liaoning Province, when the maximum temperature was high and the sunshine was abundant in June, the climate-induced yield of spring maize significantly increased. Finally, the regression models between climatic variables and climate-induced yield of spring maize in 11 representative zones in Northeast China also established geographical differences.

However, little effort is dedicated to another collateral climate change stressor, the increased frequency, and intensity of storm events, here referred to as intensified hydrodynamics. A 2-month experiment was performed to identify how OW and OA (temperature: 21 degrees C; pH(T): 7.7, 7.4; control: 17 degrees C-pH(T)7.9) affect the resistance to hydrodynamics in the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus using an integrative approach that includes physiology, biomechanics, and behavior. Biomechanics was studied under both no-flow condition at the tube foot (TF) scale and flow condition at the individual scale. For the former, TF disk adhesive properties (attachment strength, tenacity) and TF stem mechanical properties (breaking force, extensibility, tensile strength, stiffness, toughness) were evaluated. For the latter, resistance to flow was addressed as the flow velocity at which individuals detached. Under near- and far-future OW and OA, individuals fully balanced their acid-base status, but skeletal growth was halved. TF adhesive properties were not affected by treatments. Compared to the control, mechanical properties were in general improved under pH(T)7.7 while in the extreme treatment (21 degrees C-pH(T)7.4) breaking force was diminished. Three behavioral strategies were implemented by sea urchins and acted together to cope with flow: improving TF attachment, streamlining, and escaping. Behavioral responses varied according to treatment and flow velocity. For instance, individuals at 21 degrees C-pH(T)7.4 increased the density of attached TF at slow flows or controlled TF detachment at fast flows to compensate for weakened TF mechanical properties. They also showed an absence of streamlining favoring an escaping behavior as they ventured in a riskier faster movement at slow flows. At faster flows, the effects of OW and OA were detrimental causing earlier dislodgment. These plastic behaviors reflect a potential scope for acclimation in the field, where this species already experiences diel temperature and pH fluctuations.",,,,,"Flammang, Patrick/H-9465-2019; Aguera, Antonio/O-5498-2017","Flammang, Patrick/0000-0001-9938-1154; Aguera, Antonio/0000-0003-0076-1849; Bouma, Tjeerd/0000-0001-7824-7546; Cohen-Rengifo, Mishal/0000-0003-3404-1479",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,NOV,2019,9,21,,,,,12128,12143,,10.1002/ece3.5678,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5678,,OCT 2019,,,,,,31832148,,,,,WOS:000490756900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study uses descriptive data to examine the shift in dominance in the rotifer community in summer from Keratella cochlearis to Anuraeopsis fissa in a shallow eutrophic lake. Population density and egg ratio were estimated from May to September for these small loricate rotifers, as well as the soft-bodied Filinia longiseta and Polyarthra spp., to compare rates of population increase, birth and death. 2. Keratella cochlearis was succeeded by A. fissa in late May, perhaps as a result of the shorter egg development times of the latter at temperatures > 15 degrees C, and species-specific responses to food and predation. Population variables suggest that the decline of K. cochlearis was the result of a food shortage which caused a decrease in reproduction and increased mortality. 3. High population densities of A. fissa and Polyarthra spp. were associated with low egg ratios, birth rates and rates of increase within a species, suggesting intraspecific competition. The egg ratios of the two soft-bodied rotifers were strongly intercorrelated in the study period, although their diets supposedly differ. The egg ratios of A. fissa showed positively correlated fluctuations with the abundance of diatoms. 4. Short periods of higher rates of increase of A. fissa conferred advantage to this rotifer and manifested in its dominance. The mean birth rates of A. fissa and F. longiseta were twice as high as for K. cochlearis. Furthermore, death rates of loricate and soft-bodied rotifers were similar and high, which suggests that food shortage similarly increased death rates, or that predation may be sometimes substantial for soft-bodied and loricate species, or both. 5. Predation was probably not an important factor in steering the seasonal succession in the lake. A difference in abilities of the studied rotifers to exploit resources seems more important.

As compared with spring, the plants grown in summer exhibited faster growth and development, but produced fewer fruits of larger size and poorer quality due to lower sucrose content. In summer the fruits ripened within 30-35 days after anthesis, that is two weeks less than in spring. Higher average temperature was likely responsible for earlier fruit ripening in summer, as in both seasons the fruits were picked after 450-500 degree-days (base temperature of 12 degreesC). The reduction of sucrose content in summer-grown fruits was accounted for by insufficient carbon supply from source leaves and inadequate synthesis of sucrose, as suggested by the determination of leaf photosynthesis and the activity of sucrose phosphate synthase in the fruit flesh during the final stages of fruit development. Lower radiation was likely responsible for reduced photosynthesis in summer with respect to spring, since growing season did not affect leaf stomatal conductance, water and mineral relations, and chlorophyll concentration. In both seasons, increasing the macronutrient concentration of the recirculating solution enhanced plant mineral uptake, but it did not influence significantly fruit yield and quality. In other experiments, we investigated the possibility to improve fruit quality in summer crop by artificial NaCl salinization (50 mM) or by cooling the recirculating nutrient solution in order to maintain a constant temperature of 25 degreesC in the root zone, instead of fluctuating temperatures from 20-22 to 38-40 degreesC in the control.

J,"Buma, B",,,,"Buma, Brian",,,Alternate Growth Forms Can Protect Climate-Threatened Trees from Freezing Stressors,FOREST SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Climate change creates a variety of novel stressors for species, such as a decline in snowpack. Loss of snow has many impacts, including the loss of thermal insulation of soils. Winter/spring freezing of soils has been tied to forest mass mortality in multiple locations around the world. Many species, however, can take alternative growth forms, such as tall tree forms and short shrub-like forms. Shrub-forms may provide a unique protection from the snow loss phenomenon by providing a similar thermal insulation as snowpack. That hypothesis is tested here using yellow-cedar, a species undergoing mass mortality due to snow loss. Temperature loggers were placed under both tree- and shrub-form cedars, including areas where the species was experimentally removed. The number of soil freezing days was high in open areas, areas of tree mortality, and where the shrub-form was removed, but was almost zero in areas where the shrub-form was left intact. This suggests that growth-form temperature moderation is possible and may provide an important resistance to the mortality mechanism. In other areas around the world where snow loss is resulting in soil freezing and mortality, growth forms should be investigated as a potential moderating mechanism for this particular climate change stress. Study Implications: Many tree species are experiencing rapid die-off due to soil freezing, as snow declines and the ground is exposed to atmospheric temperature fluctuations. Although shrub-like growth forms of those same species are rarely investigated, the frutescent structure moderates soil temperatures, minimizing soil freezing events even in late spring when snow is gone. This provides an important refugial condition for species at risk and perhaps a way to navigate the transition from colder to warmer winters in the future while remaining a presence (albeit diminished) on the landscape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0015-749X,1938-3738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1093/forsci/fxac038,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forsci/fxac038,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000865991900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in hot regions and seasons, chickens suffer from heat stress. To dissipate excess heat, besides modifying the environment, which is costly, however, chickens with efficient heat dissipation capacity might be utilized. Naked neck chickens have a higher capacity for heat loss attributable to reduced feather mass. The naked neck mutation (Na) was originated from a large insertion (similar to 180 bp) integrated similar to 260-kb downstream of a protein-coding gene-GDF7 (Growth Differentiation Factor 7). Na possesses a cis-regulatory function and upregulates the expression of GDF7-a gene that exhibits a tissue-specific effect by the sensitizing action of retinoic acid. Na suppresses the development of feathers in the neck and vent. Na shows autosomal incomplete dominance and regulates several developmental processes. Na usually segregates at low frequency, which might be attributed to limited socio-cultural preferences. Specifically, in hot and humid regions, although to a varying extent, Na enhances performance, immunocompetence, and resilience to disease both in the homozygous and heterozygous state. Occasionally, naked neck chickens (especially the homozygous ones) lose comparative advantage in cool environments. Homozygous Na also results in high embryo death and reduced hatchability and diminishes floating and flying capacity. Nevertheless, selective breeding of naked neck chickens for fertility traits enhances the performance and welfare of chickens in hot and humid regions. The comparative advantage of Na needs to be studied not only from a temperature perspective and under controlled experiment but also from humidity, body weight, feed intake (absolute and relative to body weight), age, agroecology insights, and under field condition.

In archived samples of wheat grain and leaves obtained from the Rothamsted Broadbalk experiment archive (1844-2003), amounts of wheat, Phaeosphaeria nodorum and Mycosphaerella graminicola DNA were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Relationships between amounts of pathogens and environmental and agronomic factors were examined by multiple regression. Wheat DNA decayed at approx. 1% yr(-1) in stored grain. No M. graminicola DNA was detected in grain samples. Fluctuations in amounts of P. nodorum in grain were related to changes in spring rainfall, summer temperature and national SO2 emission. Differences in amounts of P. nodorum between grain and leaf were related to summer temperature and spring rainfall. In leaves, annual variation in spring rainfall affected both pathogens similarly, but SO2 had opposite effects. Previous summer temperature had a highly significant effect on M. graminicola. Cultivar effects were significant only at P = 0.1. Long-term variation in P. nodorum and M. graminicola DNA in leaf and grain over the period 1844-2003 was dominated by factors related to national SO2 emissions.

In April all individuals disappeared from all permanent plots, resulting in a maximum life span of 10-12 months. Individuals of newly recruited H. momus grew to have an adult size of 4-6 cm in only 3-4 months. Higher densities were observed in the shallower areas (5 m) compared to the deeper zones. More recruitment occurred on vertical slopes than horizontal substrates, but substrate pre-occupancy caused no difference in recruitment.

The monitoring of this prototype's behaviour has been performed over 24-h cycles which include an 8-h period of water circulation. With both the material and the geometry of the prototype being held constant, the influence of energy-related parameters affected by water circulation, flow and temperature upon the amount of stored energy can be evaluated. It has been shown that within the particular domain of investigation, a variation in the flow does not engender significant fluctuations in the prototype's thermal performances. As the temperature of the intake water increases, the amount of energy stored in the wall also increases. Moreover, for a water intake temperature of 42 degrees C, the surfacic heat flow remains less than the maximal threshold imposed for floor-heating installations. A model, which has already been validated for other types of materials, is applied herein in order to simulate the prototype's behaviour.

By studying water motion close to the surface we hope to determine how convection is linked to atmospheric conditions and local surface features. The usual methods of studying such processes in the ocean are by taking multiple soundings of conductivity, temperature and pressure or towing a large chain measuring temperature and salinity through a cross-section of ocean. These have the disadvantage of yielding information only while the research vessel is in the area. We have employed an alternative acoustic method that can provide data for long periods using semi-permanent moorings. The acoustic shadowgraph method relies on the fact that when an acoustic signal propagates through a region containing convective irregularities the temperature variations along the path cause the signal amplitude to fluctuate. Unlike tomography, the shadowgraph does not require travel times to be measured and so the equipment can be much cheaper. This paper describes the experimental apparatus, its testing and deployment on Vesteris Bank in the Greenland Sea in October 2001 and its recovery in April 2002.

Here we study the statistics of density fluctuations and dynamics of particles advected in an active quasi-two-dimensional medium comprising self-propelled filaments with no net orientational order, using a combination of agent-based Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical calculations. The particles interact with each other and with the self-propelled active filaments via steric interactions. We find that the particles show a tendency to cluster and their density fluctuations reflect their binding to and driving by the active filaments. The late-time dynamics of tagged particles is diffusive, with an active diffusion coefficient that is independent of (or at most weakly dependent on) temperature at low temperatures.

Bacterial cold shock proteins (Csps) are a family of conserved, RNA chaperone proteins that commonly play a role in cold temperature adaptation, including a downward shift in temperature (i.e., cold shock). The primary aim of this study was to test whether a representative, desert-dwelling Deinococcus, Deinococcus maricopensis, encodes Csps as part of its genome. Bioinformatic approaches were used to identify a Csp from D. maricopensis LB-34. The Csp, termed Dm-Csp1, contains sequence features of Csps including a conserved cold shock domain and nucleic acid binding motifs. A tertiary model of Dm-Csp1 revealed an anticipated Csp structure containing five anti-parallel beta-strands, and ligand prediction experiments identified N-terminally located residues capable of binding single-stranded nucleic acids. Putative Csps were identified from 100% of (27 of 27) Deinococci species for which genome information is available; and the Deinococci-encoded Csps identified contain a C-terminally located region that appears to be limited to members of the class Deinococci.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1687-918X,1687-9198,,,,,2017,2017,,,,,,,,5231424,10.1155/2017/5231424,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/5231424,,,,,,,,29098004,,,,,WOS:000482124200017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Key elements in the model are: (1) reconstruction of the local climate (Vent); (2) multiple linear regression analysis between measured climate and mass-balance variations; (3) reconstruction of the mass balance with (1) and (2); (4) a one-dimensional numerical ice-flow model forced by the mass-balance history. Progress relative to the previous, similar studies can be summarized as two points: (1) the mass balance is reconstructed more carefully, and (2) sensitivity experiments show that uncertainties and assumptions in the flow model hardly affect the response of the glacier to climate fluctuations with a time-scale of the order of (or larger than) the response time of the glacier (around 100 year). In the regression equation, mass-balance fluctuations are determined by the temperature during the ablation season and the annual precipitation. Cloudiness has no effect. The local temperature can be reconstructed as far back as 1755 with the temperature series from Basel, but the reconstruction of precipitation is unreliable prior to 1900.

Many previous studies have only investigated life-history plasticity in response to changes in temperature, yet wild animals often experience multiple environmental fluctuations simultaneously. This requires field experiments to decouple which ecological factor induces plasticity in fitness-relevant traits to better understand their population-level responses to those environmental fluctuations. For the past 32 years, we have conducted a long-term integrative study of individually marked North American red squirrelsTamiasciurus hudsonicusErxleben in the Yukon, Canada. We have used multi-year field experiments to examine the physiological and life-history responses of individual red squirrels to fluctuations in food abundance and conspecific density. Our long-term observational study and field experiments show that squirrels can anticipate increases in food availability and density, thereby decoupling the usual pattern where animals respond to, rather than anticipate, an ecological change. As in many other study systems, ecological factors that can induce plasticity (such as food and density) covary. However, our field experiments that manipulate food availability and social cues of density (frequency of territorial vocalizations) indicate that increases in social (acoustic) cues of density in the absence of additional food can induce similar life-history plasticity, as does experimental food supplementation. Changes in the levels of metabolic hormones (glucocorticoids) in response to variation in food and density are one mechanism that seems to induce this adaptive life-history plasticity. Although we have not yet investigated the energetic response of squirrels to elevated density or its association with life-history plasticity, energetics research in red squirrels has overturned several standard pillars of knowledge in physiological ecology. We show how a tractable model species combined with integrative studies can reveal how animals cope with resource fluctuations through life-history plasticity.",,,,,"McAdam, Andrew/G-1802-2010; Boutin, Stan/A-2619-2014; Dantzer, Ben/E-9779-2011","McAdam, Andrew/0000-0001-7323-2572; Boutin, Stan/0000-0001-6317-038X; Dantzer, Ben/0000-0002-3058-265X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2020,89,11,,,,,2397,2414,,10.1111/1365-2656.13341,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13341,,OCT 2020,,,,,,32929740,,,,,WOS:000579181100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data set has been supplemented and jointly analysed with sea surface temperature images to characterise flow variability with a particular regard on the mesoscale effects associated to the regional circulation. The current meter observations showed a southwestward flow characteristic of the Northern Current. it is strongest near the shelf break, constrained to flow along topography near the bottom but much less polarised over the upper and mid-slope. Mesoscale variability shows up as fluctuations around 3.5- and 7-day periods at 250- and 650-m depth, and around 7-day periods at 1230-m depth. The Northern Current, as observed on satellite images, forms a 30-km-wide stream with meanders displaying length scales longer than 60 km. These meanders are observed to embrace smaller structures, which are responsible for the intense mesoscale activity recorded in current meter data. Both the hydrological observations and current meter data down to 650-m depth match the superficial structures. Two major flow patterns are observed during the experiment: (i) the core of the Northern current flows south of the experimental site during March and early April, with transitory eddies moving over the experimental site; (ii) following the traverse of a westward-propagating large meander on mid-April, the Northern Current remains over the experimental site. We provide evidence that the synoptic current variability observed in the upper layer may be related to baroclinic instability.

Insect behaviors, such as flying, oviposition, parasitism, mating/calling, response to semiochemicals, and others, might be influenced by barometric pressure fluctuations. Abiotic factors controlled in the laboratory facilitate the observation of particularities related to development, behavior, and/or habits of arthropods and plants and their interactions. This study aimed to design an automated barometric chamber for research on arthropod behaviors and insect-plant interactions in the laboratory. The barometric chamber is a transparent box equipped with a single-board computer. An air pump and two proportional solenoid valves were used as actuators to control the air flow, while barometric pressure, air humidity, and temperature sensors were used to monitor the conditions within the chamber. A graphical user interface to operate the barometric chamber was developed to run in a web browser. The barometric chamber was designed to allow the barometric pressure to be changed by up to 15 hPa with respect to the local barometric pressure. In addition, the control system makes it possible to set the rise/fall time (ramp) corresponding to the duration in which a change of pressure will be conditioned. Short- and long-term evaluations demonstrated that the control system can assure pressure stability of +/- 0.1 hPa with respect to the setpoint value. For demonstration purposes, two experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence of barometric pressure on the feeding activity of Euschistus heros and Diabrotica speciosa. For E. heros, the number of stylet sheath was significantly increased under high pressure conditions compared to the low pressure. However, for D. speciosa, there was no statistical difference in leaf consumption at the evaluated testing conditions.",,,,,"Bento, José Maurício Simões/A-9759-2008; Camargo, Antonio Pires de/K-7152-2014","Bento, José Maurício Simões/0000-0001-8655-5178; Camargo, Antonio Pires de/0000-0001-5164-2634",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-3417,,,,JUL,2022,12,14,,,,,,,6971,10.3390/app12146971,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12146971,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000833246300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Extreme fluctuations in dissolved oxygen levels are well documented in Mobile Bay, AL. Extended periods of low dissolved oxygen occurring during the summer months have been shown to cause oyster mortality. The current study examined the effects of anoxia on tubule morphology of the digestive gland in the Eastern oyster as well as the quantity and quality of whole-body anaerobic bacteria counts. Oysters were exposed to anoxic conditions (<0.1 mg/L O(2)) at 28 degrees C in a laboratory setting and sampled at 0 h (preexposure), 24 h, 48 h, and 60 h, and after a 4-wk recovery interval. The whole-body anaerobic bacteria count for test oysters (Mean = 1.11 X 10(6) cfu/mL) from the 60-h interval was significantly higher than counts for the preexposure oysters, 24-h, and 48-h experimental intervals. The most common bacteria isolated were Clostridium sp. Histological examination of oysters exposed to anoxic conditions indicated stress in the digestive gland. Changes in shape and size of digestive tubule epithelial cells occurred, as well as sloughing of secretory absorptive cells into the digestive tubule lumen. Necrosis and inflammation composed of aggregates of hemocytes along with bacterial infiltration into digestive tissue was noted in oysters exposed to anoxic conditions. Digestive tubule lumen ratios of oysters sampled after a 60-h exposure to anoxia were increased significantly in comparison with preexposure oysters. Digestive tubule lumen ratios returned to preexposurc morphology after a 4-wk week recovery period. Oysters have the ability to regenerate digestive gland tissue if environmental conditions return to normal. These findings indicate that anoxia exposure at summer temperatures contributes to digestive gland atrophy and necrosis in C. virginica. The combination of digestive gland atrophy, necrosis, and bacterial infiltration into digestive tissues suggests that oysters may be succumbing to infection during periods of anoxic stress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0730-8000,,,,,DEC,2011,30,3,,,,,627,634,,10.2983/035.030.0305,http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.030.0305,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000299138700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

A single crystal of metmyoglobin is investigated in five different orientations. Several modes are assigned by the projection of the vibrational amplitude onto the beam directions. The density of phonons below 1 meV shows a quadratic increase with the energy like that in a Debye solid. An anisotropic velocity of sound in the protein crystal is extracted with a mean sound velocity of 1657 m s(-1). Modes between 4 and 5 meV are identified as haem sliding motions. Vibrations between 30.2 and 36.5 meV are mainly within the haem plane; those between 19 and 25.6 meV are perpendicular to the plane. These results together with phonon assisted Mossbauer effect measurements on hydrated myoglobin powder and polycrystal samples in the temperature range between 50 K and room temperature are compared with the results of Mossbauer absorption experiments. While the mean square displacements at the iron obtained by the phonon assisted Mossbauer effect increase linearly with temperature up to room temperature, Mossbauer absorption reveals a dynamical transition temperature. Above this temperature a much stronger increase of the mean square displacements occurs, indicating protein specific and functionally important dynamics. Since these displacements are not registered by the phonon assisted Mossbauer effect the involved energy transfer is beyond the energy resolution of the method i.e. smaller than I meV. Actually the energy transfer is in the nanoelectronvolt energy regime as seen from the energy profile of the Mossbauer absorption spectrum. Protein specific dynamics can be explained as diffusive motion of molecular segments in limited space.",,,,,,"Achterhold, Klaus/0000-0002-8724-1637",,,,,,,,,,,,,0953-8984,,,,,MAY 14,2003,15,18,,,,,S1683,S1692,PII S0953-8984(03)56032-5,10.1088/0953-8984/15/18/302,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0953-8984/15/18/302,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000183133200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Studies on diurnal fluctuation revealed that LSW was lowest at sunset, was highest between 02.00 and 04.00 h (closely corresponding with hatching of shoot fly eggs) and dropped before sunrise. This fluctuation was associated with the evaporation of water from the plant during the night. More LSW accumulation occurred during the main crop season (June-October) than in the post-rainy season (November-April). Annual fluctuation of LSW followed trends similar to the population dynamics of shoot fly and crop infestation and were correlated with rainfall, temperature and relative humidity. Measurements of leaf temperature and the vapour pressure gradient between the leaf and the air indicated that leaf surface water originates from the plant.

In contrast, the green turtle population increased gradually, with fluctuations. Hawksbill turtles had several nests annually. The sea surface temperature during the nesting season was significantly related to the annual number of nesting events in loggerhead turtles but not in green and hawksbill turtles.

However, the existing SST prediction methods do not consider the seasonal periodicity and abnormal fluctuation characteristics of SST or the importance of historical SST data from different times; thus, these methods suffer from low prediction accuracy. To solve this problem, we comprehensively consider the effects of seasonal periodicity and abnormal fluctuation characteristics of SST data, as well as the influence of historical data in different periods, on prediction accuracy. We propose a novel ensemble learning approach that combines the Predictive Recurrent Neural Network(PredRNN) network and an attention mechanism for effective SST field prediction. In this approach, the XGBoost model is used to learn the long-period fluctuation law of SST and to extract seasonal periodic features from SST data. The exponential smoothing method is used to mitigate the impact of severely abnormal SST fluctuations and extract the a priori features of SST data. The outputs of the two aforementioned models and the original SST data are stacked and used as inputs for the next model, the PredRNN network. PredRNN is the most recently developed spatiotemporal deep learning network, which simulates both spatial and temporal representations and is capable of transferring memory across layers and time steps. Therefore, we used it to extract the spatiotemporal correlations of SST data and predict future SSTs. Finally, an attention mechanism is added to capture the importance of different historical SST data, weigh the output of each step of the PredRNN network, and improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental results on two ocean datasets confirm that the proposed approach achieves higher training efficiency and prediction accuracy than the existing SST field prediction approaches do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2095-2228,2095-2236,,,,FEB,2023,17,1,,,,,,,171601,10.1007/s11704-021-1080-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11704-021-1080-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000837701000015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Metabolic rates and rate of development increased with temperature between 22 degrees C and 32 degrees C in both species. There was, however, no significant effect of temperature on cumulative oxygen consumption over the duration of metamorphosis for either species. Although M. sexta pupae are 10 times as large as T. molitor pupae, their mass-specific cost of metamorphosis (per gram of pharate adult) was similar to that of T. molitor. The large-scale histolysis and subsequent remodeling of tissues during metamorphosis makes it difficult to quantify the mass of metabolically active tissue in pupae. A mitochondrial index (MI) related to mitochondrial membrane surface area was calculated using rhodamine-123-labeled mitochondria from T. sexta pupae, yielding a measure of pupa oxidative capacity and, indirectly, the amount of active tissue in the pupa. Across development, MI fluctuated in a manner resembling (V) overdotO(2) curves from intact M. sexta. Although both MI and (V) over dotO(2) increased during the latter half of development, the increase in MI began earlier and was proportionally larger than the observed increase in (V) over dotO(2). This suggests that, through most of metamorphosis, M. sexta pupae probably have a substantial aerobic potential that remains unutilized until emergence of the adult moth.

J,"Sayer, EJ",,,,"Sayer, EJ",,,Using experimental manipulation to assess the roles of leaf litter in the functioning of forest ecosystems,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The widespread use of forest litter as annual bedding in central Europe for many, centuries gave rise to the first litter manipulation studies, and their results demonstrated that litter and its decomposition are a vital part or ecosystem function. Litter plays two major roles in forest ecosystems: firstly, litterfall is all inherent part of nutrient and carbon cycling, and secondly, litter forms a protective layer oil the soil surface that also regulates microclimatic conditions. By reviewing 152 years of litter manipulation experiments, I show that the effects or manipulating litter stem from changes in one, or both, of these two functions, and interactions between the variables influenced by the accumulation of litter can result in feedback mechanisms that may intensify treatment effects or mask responses, making the interpretation of results difficult. Long-term litter removal increased soil bulk density, overland flow, erosion, and temperature fluctuations and upset the soil water balance, causing lower soil water content during dry periods. Soil pH increased or decreased in response to manipulation treatments depending on forest type and initial soil pH, but unclear why there was no uniform response. Long-term litter harvesting severely depleted the forests of nutrients. Decreases in the concentrations of available P, Ca, Mg, and K in the soil occurred after only three to five years. The decline in soil N occurred over longer periods of time, and the relative loss was greater in soils with high initial nitrogen concentration. Tree growth declined with long-term litter removal, probably due to lower nutrient availability. Litter manipulation also added or removed large amounts of carbon thereby affecting microbial communities and altering soil respiration rates. Litter manipulation experiments have shown that litter cover acts as a physical barrier to the shoot emergence of small-seeded species; further, the microclimate maintained by the litter layer may be Favourable to herbivores and pathogens and is important in determining later seedling survival and performance. Litter manipulation altered the competitive outcomes between tree seedlings and forbs, thereby influencing species composition and diversity; changes in the species composition of understorey vegetation following treatments occurred rapidly. By decreasing substrate availability and altering the microclimate, litter removal changed fungal species composition and diversity and led to a decline in populations of soil fauna. However, litter addition did not provoke an corresponding increase in the abundance or diversity of fungi or soil fauna. Large-scale long-term studies are still needed in order to investigate the interactions between the many variables affected by litter, especially in tropical and boreal forests, which have received little attention. Litter manipulation treatments present an opportunity to assess the effects of increasing primary production in forest ecosystems; specific research aims include assessing the effect of changes in litter inputs on the carbon and nutrient cycles, decomposition processes, and the turnover of organic matter.",,,,,"Sayer, Emma/B-2514-2010","Sayer, Emma/0000-0002-3322-4487",,,,,,,,,,,,,1464-7931,1469-185X,,,,FEB,2006,81,1,,,,,1,31,,10.1017/S1464793105006846,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1464793105006846,,,,,,,,16460580,,,,,WOS:000236101600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our best available information currently comes from a limited number of field experiments and terrestrial biosphere model (TBM) simulations of varying predictive accuracy. Here, we assessed the sensitivity of annual boreal/hemi-boreal forest growth in Canada to yearly fluctuations in seasonal climate variables using a large tree -ring dataset and compared this to the climate sensitivity of annual net primary productivity (NPP) estimates obtained from fourteen TBMs. We found that boreal/hemi-boreal forest growth sensitivity to fluctuations in seasonal tempera-ture and precipitation variables changed along a southwestern to northeastern gradient, with growth limited almost entirely by temperature in the northeast and west and by water availability in the southwest. We also found a lag in growth climate sensitivity, with growth largely determined by the climate during the summer prior to ring formation. Analyses of NPP sensitivity to the same climate variables produced a similar southwest to northeast gradient in growth climate sensitivity for NPP estimates from all but three TBMs. However, analyses of growth from tree-ring data and analyses of NPP from TBMs produced contrasting evidence concerning the key climate variables limiting growth. While analyses of NPP primarily indicated a positive relationship between growth and seasonal temperature, tree -ring analyses indicated negative growth relationships to temperature. Also, the positive effect of precipitation on NPP derived from most TBMs was weaker than the positive effect of precipitation on tree-ring based growth: temper-ature had a more important limiting effect on NPP than tree-ring data indicated. These mismatches regarding the key climate variables limiting growth suggested that characterization of tree growth in TBMs might need revision, partic-ularly regarding the effects of stomatal conductance and carbohydrate reserve dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,DEC 10,2022,851,,2,,,,,,158062,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158062,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158062,,,,,,,,35981579,,,,,WOS:000861248900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Predictable seasonality with cold/long winters and short/cool summers are combined with unpredictable between and within year variation. This indicates that various selection pressures act on the reproductive strategies of the populations. The arctic collembolan Hypogastrura tullbergi reproduces in a short period following snow melt. Hatching occurs in late summer, the animals grow to adult size within their second summer and reproduce for the first time in the beginning of their third summer. We performed several experiments to determine the reproductive investment and proximate mechanism that regulate timing and duration of reproduction. We found that H. tullbergi entered a reproductive diapause when reared at constant temperature, a diapause that was terminated by a cold exposure (winter). Surprisingly, cold exposure of small juveniles may also prevent development of a reproductive diapause in adults. Thus, the life-cycle normally spanning 2 yr can potentially be reduced to one year if the overwintering juveniles reach maturity before the end of the reproductive period in the field. After termination of the diapause: the animals reproduced up to 3 times during a period of 6 weeks at 15 degrees C. This reproductive period was considerably longer (measured in degree days) than the one observed in the field. Our results suggested that temperature quiescence, i.e. the inability to reproduce under a certain temperature threshold, may adjust the termination of the reproductive period with current temperature before a new diapause occurs in late summer. The cost of reproduction was low and suggests that it can be adaptive to spread reproduction over more than one year. The results are discussed in relation to the arctic climate and strategies favoured by unpredictable and predictable (seasonal) variations in the environment. The present study forms part of a larger investigation on population dynamics and life history strategies of H. tullbergi from the Arctic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,FEB,1999,22,1,,,,,31,39,,10.1111/j.1600-0587.1999.tb00452.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1999.tb00452.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000079182800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Postsynaptic potentials were recorded in lumbar motoneurons of the frog in response to electrical activation of dorsal loots. After chemical synaptic transmission was blocked by replacing Ca2+ with Mg2+ in the superfusion medium, it was confirmed that the remaining electrical excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EEPSPs) recorded in motoneurons consisted of potential changes produced by electrical coupling between the motoneurons and the stimulated axons. The EEPSPs could then be used as an assay tl, study the reliability of spike propagation into presynaptic terminals. 2. EEPSPs typically consisted of three components. The first was a small positive deflection (prespike or presynaptic volley) that could also be recorded extracellularly. The second component was a spikelike fast positive component and the third was a slow positive component that followed the second but hall a distinct maximum and a slow decay. The amplitude of the fast component did not correlate with that of either the prespike or the slow component. 3. 4-Aminopyridine (0.1 mM), which widens action potentials by blocking K+ channels, increased the amplitude and width of EEPSPs. Heptanol (1-4 mM), which is known to be a blocker of electrical coupling, could block EEPSPs. 4. The amplitudes of EEPSPs evoked by dorsal root stimulation were compared at different temperatures (7.5-19.5 degrees C). A slight decrease of the amplitude of the fast component with increasing temperature (Q(10) = 0.8) was within limits predicted by resistance-capacitance filtering of the presynaptic spike at the different temperatures, suggesting that the temperature does not affect propagation of the spike in this synapse. 5. The amplitude of the fast component of EEPSPs evoked by single-pulse and paired-pulse stimulation did not fluctuate more than the baseline noise in 37 experiments in which the SD of baseline noise was <100 mu V. We conclude that electric:al synaptic transmission does not fluctuate intermittently in this system, and that branch points conduct or fail to conduct for periods of time longer than the longest period in the analyzed experiments.",,,,,"Dityatev, Alexander/A-4034-2008","Dityatev, Alexander/0000-0002-0472-0553",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3077,,,,,NOV,1996,76,5,,,,,3451,3459,,10.1152/jn.1996.76.5.3451,http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/jn.1996.76.5.3451,,,,,,,,8930285,,,,,WOS:A1996VT08200052,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, when ice crystals are large, present in high amounts, and/or irregularly distributed, irreversible damage to food can occur. Therefore, ice growth is a vital parameter that needs to be controlled during frozen food processing and storage. In this review, ice growth theory and control are described. Macroscopic heat and mass transfer processes, the relationship between the growth of ice crystals and macroscopic heat transfer factors, and nucleation theory are reviewed based on the reported theoretical and experimental approaches. The issues addressed include how heat transfer occurs inside samples, variations in thermal properties with temperature, boundary conditions, and the functional relationship between ice crystal growth and freezing parameters. Quick freezing (e.g., cryogenic freezing) and unavoidable temperature fluctuations (e.g., multiple freeze-thaw cycles) are both taken into consideration. The approaches for controlling ice crystal growth based on the ice morphology and content are discussed. The characteristics and initial mechanisms of ice growth inhibitors (e.g., antifreeze proteins (AFPs), polysaccharides, and phenols) and ice nucleation agents (INAs) are complex, especially when considering their molecular structures, the ice-binding interface, and the dose.

Twelve lactating multiparous Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were housed in controlled-climate chambers for 4 days. Six were exposed to a short-term temperature and humidity challenge (THc, diurnal temperature and humidity fluctuations inducing moderate heat stress; temperature humidity index 74-84) and six cows were exposed to thermoneutral conditions (THn, temperatur humidity index 55-61). Cows were also measured during a 7-day pre-experimental and 14-day post-experimental period. Physiological indicators of heat stress were measured, including rectal and vaginal temperature and respiration rate, which indicated that the THc in controlled-climate chambers induced moderate heat stress. The cows exposed to the 4-day THc reduced their milk yield by 53% and their dry-matter intake by 48%, compared with the cows in the THn treatment. Milk yield of THc cows returned to pre-experimental milk yield by Day 7 and dry-matter intake by Day 4 of the post-experimental period. The short-term heat challenge induced metabolic adaptations by mobilising adipose tissue, as indicated by increased non-esterified fatty acids, and amino acids from skeletal muscle, as indicated by increased urea nitrogen to compensate for reduced nutrient intake and increased energy expenditure. Endocrine responses included greater prolactin concentrations, which is associated with thermoregulation and water metabolism. The cows exposed to THc displayed production and physical responses that facilitated lower metabolic heat production and greater heat dissipation in an attempt to maintain homeostasis during the short-term heat exposure. These results indicated that the conditions imposed on the cows in the controlled-climate chambers were sufficient to induce heat-stress responses and adversely affected production in the lactating dairy cow, and the delay between the return to normal feed intake and milk yield following the heat challenge suggests a period of metabolic recovery was occurring.",,,,,"DiGiacomo, Kristy/AAG-7541-2019; Hayes, Ben J/L-3308-2016; Leury, Brian/L-6231-2019; Marett, Leah/AAB-1663-2019","DiGiacomo, Kristy/0000-0002-6590-3513; Hayes, Ben J/0000-0002-5606-3970; Leury, Brian/0000-0001-9173-2730; Marett, Leah/0000-0001-9698-8401; Williams, Richard/0000-0003-1321-6487",,,,,,,,,,,,,1836-0939,1836-5787,,,,JUN,2017,57,7,,,,,1233,1241,,10.1071/AN16472,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AN16472,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000402662500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we explored the role of seed germination traits in shaping wetland community assembly along a hydroperiod gradient. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that seeds of reed, mudflat, swamp, shallow- and deep-water communities only germinate under a specific set of environmental factors characterized by the community-specific optimal conditions for seedling survival and growth. Methods In a three-factorial experiment, we tested the seed germination response of 50 species typical for temperate wetlands of Europe to temperature fluctuations (constant vs. fluctuating temperature), illumination (light vs. darkness) and oxygen availability (aerobic vs. hypoxia). Phylogenetic principal component analysis, cluster analysis and phylogenetic linear regressions were used to confirm the community-specific seed germination niches. Key Results Our study revealed the presence of five distinct, community-specific seed germination niches that reflect adaptations made by the study communities to decreasing light intensity, temperature fluctuations and oxygen availability along the hydroperiod gradient. Light as a germination trigger was found to be important in mudflats, swamps and shallow water, whereas the seeds of reed and deep-water species were able to germinate in darkness. A fluctuating temperature is only required for seed germination in mudflat species. Germination of species in the communities at the higher end of the hydroperiod gradient (reed and mudflat) demonstrated a strict requirement for oxygen, whereas swamp, shallow- and deep-water species also germinated under hypoxia. Conclusions Our study supports the recent argument that the inclusion of seed germination traits in community ecology adds significant insights to community response to the abiotic and biotic environment. Furthermore, the close relationship between seed germination adaptations and community assembly could help reach a better understanding of the existing patterns of wetland plant distribution at local scales and wetland vegetation dynamics, as well as facilitate nature conservation measures and aquatic habitat restoration.",,,,,"PHARTYAL, SHYAM S./H-4229-2019; Poschlod, Peter/AAF-7902-2019; Rosbakh, Sergey/AAO-8524-2020","PHARTYAL, SHYAM S./0000-0003-3266-6619; Rosbakh, Sergey/0000-0002-4599-6943",,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,JAN 2,2020,125,1,,,,,67,78,,10.1093/aob/mcz139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcz139,,,,,,,,31420645,,,,,WOS:000540290700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pathogen populations in the canals of the Delta (similar to 100-200 cfu l(-1)) were generally variable throughout the year with presence linked to potato cultivation in the immediate area. The pathogen was not detected in irrigation or drainage water associated with potato cultivation in the newly reclaimed desert areas (designated as Pest-Free Areas, PFAs) or in the main branches of the Nile upstream from these areas. In vitro studies showed that temperature and microbial activity were the main factors affecting survival of the pathogen in canal water. In experiments at temperatures of 4, 15, 28 and 35A degrees C, survival was longest at 15A degrees C and shortest at 35A degrees C. Survival at 4 and 28A degrees C tended to be intermediate between these extremes as was survival when the bacterium was grown at fluctuating temperatures. Aeration, solarisation and pH variation between 4 and 9 appeared to have little effect on survival. Survival in autoclaved or filter-sterilised canal water was longer than in untreated water irrespective of other factors with survival times exceeding 300 days at 15A degrees C in some experiments.

Physical and chemical and agrochemical properties of the soils were studied by conventional methods of pedology. The biological activity of soils was characterized by indicators of enzymatic activity. Effects of fertilizers were studied in 3 -year field experiments. The study results showed that the destruction of forest cover due to cutting and stubbing and subsequent land plowing leads to drastic changes in regimes and properties of frozen soils. The seasonal and daily amplitudes of temperature fluctuations are increased in open areas in the ground layer of air and soils. Due to increase in the inflow of heat to the surface of the soil during summer period it is observed a twofold temperature rise in the topsoil. This process increases the capacity of the seasonally thawing layer in 3 times and consequently increases evaporation, gradual dehydration and compaction of soils and deterioration of their agrophysical properties. During the development of forest areas for arable lands the natural cyclicity of admission to the soil organic matter from plant litter is disrupted, and a significant portion of the richest by microorganisms and enzymes organic horizons are destroyed and alienated, which inevitably leads to the impoverishment of soils, reduction of their biological potential. The soils lose their natural fertility quickly and are strongly depleted in such conditions.

We used process-based modeling to assess the effects of climatic warming in southeastern China on the leaf-out phenology of pecan seedlings and the subsequent risk of false springs, i.e., damage caused by low temperatures occurring as a result of prematurely leafing out. In order to maximize the biological realism of the model used in scenario simulations, we developed the model on the basis of experiments explicitly designed for determining the responses modeled. The model showed reasonable internal accuracy when calibrated against leaf-out observations in a whole-tree chamber (WTC) experiment with nine different natural-like fluctuating temperature treatments. The model was used to project the timing of leaf-out in the period 2022-2099 under the warming scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 in southeastern China. Two locations in the main pecan cultivation area in the northern subtropical zone and one location south of the main cultivation area were addressed. Generally, an advancing trend of leaf-out was projected for all the three locations under both warming scenarios, but in the southern location, a delay was projected under RCP8.5 in many years during the first decades of the 21st century. In the two northern locations, cold damage caused by false springs was projected to occur once in 15-26 years at most, suggesting that pecan cultivation can be continued relatively safely in these two locations. Paradoxically, more frequent cold damage was projected for the southern location than for the two northern locations. The results for the southern location also differed from those for the northern locations in that more frequent cold damage was projected under the RCP4.5 warming scenario (once in 6 years) than under the RCP8.5 scenario (once in 11 years) in the southern location. Due to the uncertainties of the model applied, our conclusions need to be re-examined in an additional experimental study and further model development based on it; but on the basis of our present results, we do not recommend starting large-scale pecan cultivation in locations south of the present main pecan cultivation area in southeastern subtropical China.",,,,,,"Zhang, Rui/0000-0002-7235-505X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-462X,,,,,NOV 30,2021,12,,,,,,,,768963,10.3389/fpls.2021.768963,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.768963,,,,,,,,34917105,,,,,WOS:000731642600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Complementary laboratory and field experiments investigated P. canescens germination. A thermogradient plate was used to examine its germination response to a variety of temperature regimes. Recruitment in the field was investigated at four sites across two catchments following four season disturbances. In the laboratory trials, seeds required temperatures that alternated by at least 5 degrees C, light, and to be covered by a thin film of water. Field germination occurred only at the one site that experienced a flood, despite periods of high rainfall that stimulated germination of other species. In this site seedling density and survivorship were reduced in the presence of existing vegetation. A survey of P. canescens following flooding of a temporary billabong revealed recruitment from both seed and vegetative fragments. This recruitment was almost exclusively restricted to the area that had been flooded.

In general, individuals darkened when exposed to cold conditions, and lightened when exposed to warm conditions. Males from different populations differed in the magnitude of response to temperature, but had similar directional changes in shade (dark under cold conditions and light under warm conditions) suggesting differences among populations in the ability to change color. Females showed similar directional changes but there were no differences among populations.

These treatments combined three approaches to obtain early Lee emergence: (1) exposing bees to warmer or fluctuating temperatures, or both, during development; (2) exposing bees to warmer wintering temperatures: and (3) using early-flying lee populations from Central Valley California latitudes. Extended periods of high prewintering temperatures resulted in apparent fat bod, consumption of prewintering adults and reductions in springtime adult longevity. In general, temperature treatments that promoted rapid immature development, and thus longer wintering periods, resulted in earlier spring emergence patterns of bees well timed with bloom period of almonds. Warmer wintering periods also resulted in earlier emergence. In addition to providing good Ice-bloom synchrony, several treatments also yielded vigorous emerging populations, rapid establishment and nesting, and population increases.

We find a winter mean offshore heat flux of 8.7 x 10(5) W m-1, about a factor of 5 smaller than earlier estimates of the mean summer (upwelling season) offshore heat flux on the northern California shelf. The mean offshore heat flux is predominantly in the surface boundary layer and is balanced by an along-shelf heat flux divergence (as represented by an eddy along-shelf temperature gradient flux) and a cooling trend making the mean winter heat balance fundamentally three dimensional. In contrast to winter, the spring mean offshore heat flux of 6.4 X 10(5) W M-1 is balanced by a positive air-sea heat flux of 8.3 x 10(5) W m-1, which is about 80% of the mean air-sea heat flux in summer. This makes the spring mean heat budget primarily two dimensional, like the summer mean heat budget off northern California. On timescales of days the dominant terms in the fluctuating heat budget in both winter and spring are the cross-shelf heat flux and local changes in heat content. These are well correlated with each other and with the local along-shelf wind stress. The along-shelf temperature gradient flux, uncorrelated with the along-shelf wind stress, is usually weak on timescales of days. Occurrences when it is strong are interpreted as effects of mesoscale features. Mean and fluctuating cross-shelf salt fluxes provide essentially the same information as cross-shelf heat fluxes.

The study is based on a reaction-diffusion-taxis model, which is used to analyse the dynamics of five phytoplankton groups, responsible for about 80% of the total chlorophyll a inside the euphotic zone of the water column. The analysis is performed by considering: (i) the intraspecific competition of the phytoplanktonic groups for limiting factors, i.e. light intensity and nutrient concentration, (ii) the seasonal changes of environmental variables, and (iii) the random fluctuations of the components of the velocity field and temperature. Specifically, we investigate the effects of external perturbations, both deterministic and random, on the dynamics of phytoplankton populations, by inserting a term of multiplicative noise into the differential equation of the nutrient dynamics. The theoretical results of the phytoplankton abundances obtained by the stochastic model are converted in chlorophyll a concentrations, and compared with the experimental findings. The statistical checks, based on the chi-square test, show that the vertical distributions of total chlorophyll concentration are in a good agreement with the experimental data.

Due to the interrelationship, thermal and moisture transfer should be simultaneously calculated for an accurate building performance evaluation. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of moisture transportation on energy efficiency, thermal comfort and mould growth risks in residential buildings based on the hygrothermal simulation. First, hygrothermal simulation is conducted to evaluate the energy efficiency and IAQ in the selected residential building. This paper also provides characteristics of the hygrothermal properties of domestic building materials which are used for the selected residential building. Differences between experimental data for the domestic materials and properties from embedded data in the hygrothermal simulation program are discussed. Second, a hygrothermal calculation model is calibrated with the measurement data for indoor air temperature and relative humidity in the selected residential building. Lastly, we illustrate the effect of moisture transfer on the overall building performance by comparing the hygrothermal simulation results with thermal-only simulation (only consideration of heat transfer through the building envelope) results. The results suggest that heating and cooling energy can be underestimated without consideration of moisture transportation mechanisms in the building energy simulation.

Elevated CO2 led to enhanced growth in tomato plants under salt stress through stimulation of photosynthesis and reduced concentrations of abscisic acid and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid in both leaves and roots. Furthermore, whereas high salinity reduced the concentration of Krebs Cycle intermediates and increased the concentration of photorespiratory metabolites glycine and serine, all were restored to control levels by elevated CO2.

Many kinds of substances have been identified as SCPSs that promote supercooling of aqueous solutions in a non-colligative manner by reducing the ice nucleation capability (INC) of ice nucleators (INs). The SCC as revealed by reduction of freezing temperature (degrees C) by SCPSs differs greatly depending on the INs. While no single SCPS that affects homogeneous ice nucleation to reduce ice nucleation point has been found, many SCPSs have been found to reduce freezing temperatures by heterogeneous ice nucleation with a large fluctuation of SCC depending on the kind of heterogeneous IN. Not only SCPSs increase the degree of SCC (degrees C), but also some SCPSs have additional SCC to stabilize a supercooling state for a long term to stabilize supercooling against strong mechanical disturbance and to reduce sublimation of ice crystals. The mechanisms underlying the diverse functions of SCPSs remain to be determined in future studies.",,,,,,"Kasuga, Jun/0000-0002-3173-618X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0065-2598,2214-8019,978-9-8113-1244-1,,,,2018,1081,,,,,,289,320,,10.1007/978-981-13-1244-1_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-1244-1_16,10.1007/978-981-13-1244-1,,,,,,,30288716,,,,,WOS:000458012800018,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a statistical mechanical approach, the signaling due to the conformational changes is a thermodynamic average quantity, dependent on the temperature and the total energy of the system, including both ligand-receptor interaction and receptor-receptor interaction. This physical theory suggests to biology an understanding of cooperation in ligand binding and receptor signaling problems. How much experimental support of this approach can be obtained from the currently available data? What are the parameter values? What is the practical information for experiments?

The experimental facility was a bottom-heated, water-filled, cubical tank mounted on a turntable. The investigations were performed over a wide range of bottom buoyancy fluxes q0 and rotation rates OMEGA, including OMEGA = 0; q0 and OMEGA were held constant during each experiment. The depth of the water column H was fixed for the entire experimental programme. For the non-rotating experiments, the r.m.s. velocity fluctuations were found to scale well with the convective velocity w* = (q0 H)1/3, while the mean and r.m.s. fluctuations of buoyancy were found to scale with q0/w*. The spectra of temperature fluctuations were measured and were used to assess the applicability of two types of scaling, one of which is advanced in the present study. For the rotating experiments, the convective-layer growth is affected by the rotation at a height h(c) almost-equal-to 4.5(q0-OMEGA-3)1/2. The r.m.s. horizontal velocity of the rotationally affected mixed layer is uniform throughout the mixed layer and is given by (u'2BAR)r1/2 almost-equal-to 1.7(q0-OMEGA-1)1/2. The time growth law of the mixed-layer thickness h(r), when h(r) > h(c), is given by h(r) almost-equal-to 0.7(q0-OMEGA-3)1/2-OMEGA-t, where t is the time. The rotational effects become important when the Rossby number is given by Ro = (u'2BAR)r1/2/OMEGA-l(r) almost-equal-to 1.5, where the integral lengthscale is estimated as l(r) almost-equal-to 0.25h(c). The mean buoyancy gradient in the mixed layer was found to be much higher than in the corresponding non-rotating case, and the r.m.s. fluctuations and mean byoyancies were found to scale satisfactorily with (q0-OMEGA)1/2.

Although epigenetic regulation of plant gene expression is well studied, how plants maintain a memory of environmental changes over time remains unclear. Here, we show that JUMONJI (JMJ) proteins, demethylases involved in histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), are necessary for Arabidopsis thaliana heat acclimation. Acclimation induces sustained H3K27me3 demethylation at HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN22 (HSP22) and HSP17.6C loci by JMJs, poising the HSP genes for subsequent activation. Upon sensing heat after a 3-day interval, JMJs directly reactivate these HSP genes. Finally, jmj mutants fail to maintain heat memory under fluctuating field temperature conditions. Our findings of an epigenetic memory mechanism involving histone demethylases may have implications for environmental adaptation of field plants.

Early life stages can be particularly sensitive to environmental stress, such that experiences early in life can carry over to have long-term effects on organism fitness. Despite the potential importance of these within-generation carryover effects, we have little understanding of how they vary across ecological contexts, particularly when organisms are re-exposed to the same stressors later in life. In coastal marine systems, anthropogenic nutrients and warming water temperatures are reducing average dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations while also increasing the severity of naturally occurring daily fluctuations in DO. Combined effects of warming and diel-cycling DO can strongly affect the fitness and survival of coastal organisms, including the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), a critical ecosystem engineer and fishery species. However, whether early life exposure to hypoxia and warming affects oysters' subsequent response to these stressors is unknown. Using a multiphase laboratory experiment, we explored how early life exposure to diel-cycling hypoxia and warming affected oyster growth when oysters were exposed to these same stressors 8 weeks later. We found strong, interactive effects of early life exposure to diel-cycling hypoxia and warming on oyster tissue : shell growth, and these effects were context-dependent, only manifesting when oysters were exposed to these stressors again two months later. This change in energy allocation based on early life stress exposure may have important impacts on oyster fitness. Exposure to hypoxia and warming also influenced oyster tissue and shell growth, but only later in life. Our results show that organisms' responses to current stress can be strongly shaped by their previous stress exposure, and that context-dependent carryover effects may influence the fitness, production, and restoration of species of management concern, particularly for sessile species such as oysters.",,,,,,"Donelan, Sarah/0000-0002-4066-7884; Ogburn, Matthew/0000-0001-5417-555X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,JUN,2021,31,4,,,,,,,e02315,10.1002/eap.2315,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2315,,MAR 2021,,,,,,33636022,,,,,WOS:000635139700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accordingly, the objective of this study is to investigate fundamental mechanisms that control drought effects on climate sensitive ecosystems by regulating soil-plant interactions. Field experiments were conducted in high altitudinal grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau. Based on historical records, we simulated extreme drought events, intercepting water inputs in early (spring), mid (summer), and late (autumn) periods of the plant-growing season (PGS). We measured vegetation responses to changes in soil physical, chemical, and biological properties, examining how the interplay of abiotic and biotic processes regulate the impacts of drought above and below ground. Decreasing water input resulted in proportional increases in summer and autumn soil temperature, but reduced soil temperature during the spring drought. As a result, soil microbial biomass and available N and P concentrations remained stable during the early-PGS drought, while enzymatic activity, decomposition of organic materials, and nutrient release increased during the mid- and late-PGS. Concerted changes in microbial and plant activity determined seasonal fluctuations in carbon assimilation, microbial activity and nutrient dynamics, with varying degrees of resistance and resilience to drought stress observed at different PGS periods. Significant interactions were observed between plant productivity and microbial activity in response to moisture variability and associated changes in soil temperature, with the largest deleterious drought effects registered during the summer, when competition for limiting resources between plants and microorganisms was strongest.",,,,,"Silva, Lucas C R/E-1202-2016; Silva, Lucas/GQH-8201-2022; Silva, Lucas/AAA-2476-2022","Silva, Lucas C R/0000-0002-4838-327X; Silva, Lucas/0000-0002-4838-327X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,1573-5036,,,,APR,2015,389,1-2,,,,,59,71,,10.1007/s11104-014-2337-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2337-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000352153600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experiments were conducted to reveal the influence of the internal surface area and the structure of the network on species composition and distribution within sea ice. The surface of the brine channel walls was measured via a newly developed method using a fluorogenic tracer. These measurements allowed us to quantify the internal surface area accessible for predators of different sizes, at different ice temperatures and in different ice textures. Total internal surface area ranged from 0.6 to 4 m(2) kg(-1) ice and declined with decreasing ice temperature. Potentially, 6 to 41% of the area at -2 degrees C is covered by micro-organisms. Cooling from -2 to -6 degrees C drastically increases the coverage of organisms in brine channels due to a surface reduction. A combination of brine channel frequency measurements with an artificial brine network experiment suggests that brine channels less than or equal to 200 mu m comprise a spatial refuge with microbial community concentrations one to two magnitudes higher than in the remaining channel network. The plasticity of predators to traverse narrow passages was experimentally tested for representative Arctic sympagic rotifers, turbellarians, and nematodes. By conforming to the osmotic pressure of the brine turbellaria match their body dimensions to the fluctuating dimensions of the brine channel system during freezing. Rotifers penetrate very narrow passages several times their body length and 57% their body diameter. In summary, ice texture, temperature, and bulk salinity influence the predatory-prey interactions by superimposing its structural component on the dynamic of the sympagic food web. Larger predators are excluded from brine channels depending on the architecture of the channel network. However, extreme body flexibility allows some predators to traverse structural impasses in the brine channel network. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Treatments were as follows: conventional fertilization (CF, as control), fertilizer postponing (FP, with the same amount fertilization as CF and increasing rate and times of panicle fertilizer) with/without straw incorporation (including only straw returned in rice (W) or wheat (R) season, and both straw incorporation (WS), RFP (reducing amount based on FP) with/without organic fertilizer.

Such a difference is expected under the hypotheses that perturbed growth and development and concomitant morphological asymmetry may result from exposure to unfavourable temperatures or costs associated with melanization, or reflect a by-product of past disease in individuals with poor immune responsiveness. Results from mixed model two-way ANOVAs uncovered no statistically significant directional asymmetry in femur size, whereas non-directional asymmetry was significant in each of the four different colour morphs. The degree of intraindividual, interlateral variance in femur size varied significantly among individuals belonging to different colour morphs, being considerably higher in the black morph, which also suffers the greatest risk of overheating, compared to the brown, striped and grey morphs. Asymmetry in femur size was not associated with one measure of immune responsiveness, the encapsulation response of individuals experimentally implanted with a novel antigen consisting of a nylon mono-filament.

This, in turn, leads to long-ranged fluctuation-induced (Casimir) forces, predicted to arise in a variety of nonequilibrium settings. Here, we study such forces, which arise transiently between parallel plates or compact inclusions in a gas of particles, following a change (quench) in temperature or activity of the medium. Analytical calculations, as well as numerical simulations of passive or active Brownian particles, indicate two distinct forces: (i) The immediate effect of the quench is adsorption or desorption of particles of the medium to the immersed objects, which in turn initiates a front of relaxing (mean) density. This leads to time-dependent density-induced forces. (ii) Along-term effect of the quench is that density fluctuations are modified, manifested as transient (long-ranged) (pair-) correlations that relax diffusively to their (short-ranged) steady-state limit. As a result, transient fluctuation-induced forces emerge. We discuss the properties of fluctuation-induced and density-induced forces as regards universality, relaxation as a function of time, and scaling with distance between objects.

The performance of these same experiments in simulating observed global-scale changes in precipitation has not previously been examined. Here we use a gridded terrestrial precipitation dataset for the period 1900 to 1996 to examine the extent to which observed global and zonal-mean precipitation sensitivities to global warming have been captured by a series of model simulations recently completed by the UK Hadley Centre. There are signs that the model has been able to reproduce at least some of the observed zonal-mean variations in the precipitation sensitivity to warming.

Coincident data were also collected on ice thickness, temperature, and salinity together with a variety of basic meteorological data. Several phenomena were found to be common to all the laboratory measurements, with some indication that similar features were also present in the field data. These include (1) a sharp rise in surface temperature when the ice was between 1 and 2 cm thick, apparently unrelated to any environmental changes, (2) a decrease in brightness temperature (T(b)) at 37 GHz during or just after the surface temperature rise, and (3) an initial increase in T(b) with increasing ice thickness, followed by substantial decreases in T(b) at the higher (19, 37, and 90 GHz) frequencies. The maximum T(b) values observed were higher than those previously reported for young ice. T(b) was also found to be much more sensitive to variations in ice properties at horizontal polarization than at vertical polarization. Numerical modeling results indicate that the high-frequency decreases in T(b) were not due to bulk changes in either ice temperature or salinity. The most likely explanation for the observed rise in surface temperature and decrease in T(b) was the formation of a salinity-enhanced ice or brine surface layer caused by the upward transport of brine as the ice grows.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,MAY 15,1993,98,C5,,,,,8531,8545,,10.1029/93JC00136,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/93JC00136,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LC97400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this investigation, experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of environmental factors on the germination and emergence of B. pilosa, and also on the response of this weed to commonly available post-emergence herbicides in Australia. The environmental factors of particular interest to this current work were the effect of light and temperature, salinity, burial depth and moisture on B. pilosa since these are key management issues in Australian agriculture. In addition, the effects of a number of commonly used herbicides were examined, because of concerns regarding emerging herbicide resistance. In the tested light/dark regimes, germination was found to be higher at fluctuating day/night temperatures of 25/15 degrees C and 30/20 degrees C (92-93%) than at 35/25 degrees C (79%), whilst across the different temperature ranges, germination was higher in the light/dark regime (79-93%) than in complete darkness (22-38%). The standard five-minute temperature pretreatment required for 50% inhibition of maximum germination was found to be 160 degrees C, and it was further shown that no seeds germinated at temperatures higher than 240 degrees C. With regard to salinity, some B. pilosa seeds germinated (3%) in 200 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) but all failed to germinate at 250 mM NaCl. Germination declined from 89% to 2% as the external osmotic potential decreased from 0 to -0.6 MPa, and germination ceased at -0.8 MPa. Seeding emergence of B. pilosa was maximum (71%) for seeds placed on the soil surface and it was found that no seedlings emerged from a depth of 8 cm or greater. A depth of 3.75 cm was required to inhibit the seeds to 50% of the maximum emergence. In this study, application of glufosinate, glyphosate and paraquat provided commercially acceptable control levels (generally accepted as >90%) when applied at the four-leaf stage of B. pilosa. However, none of the herbicide treatments involved in this study provided this level of control when applied at the six-leaf stage. In summary, B. pilosa germination has been clearly shown to be stimulated by light and thus its emergence was greatest from the soil surface. This suggests that infestation from this weed will remain as a problem in no-till conservation agriculture systems, the use of which is increasing now throughout the world. It is intended that information generated from this study be used to develop more effective integrated management programs for B. pilosa and similar weeds in commercial agricultural environments which are tending toward conservation approaches.",,,,,"Ali, Hafiz Haider/ABE-6457-2021; Chauhan, Bhagirath/G-8892-2014","Ali, Hafiz Haider/0000-0002-8262-6327; Chauhan, Bhagirath/0000-0003-1540-4668",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,NOV 5,2019,9,,,,,,,,16004,10.1038/s41598-019-52620-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52620-9,,,,,,,,31690889,,,,,WOS:000494258500024,View Full Record in Web of Science

As the majority of previous research has focused on experimental streams or larger river systems, knowledge on the effects of hydro regulation on small rivers, in particular during winter, are scarce. In order to increase our understanding on the winter ecology of Atlantic salmon parr (Salmo salar L.), we studied parr distribution and mobility in a small (average wetted width: 10.7 m), steep (average riverbed gradient: 1.3%) and unregulated river throughout winter. We tagged 145 parr using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) technology. During autumn, freeze-up, mid winter and late winter, parr were tracked using manual tracking devices. Each time an individual was found, its position was geo-referenced. Water discharge and water temperature were recorded continuously throughout the study period. Forty-eight parr were observed at least once during all four tracking surveys. Of these, only thirty-one were observed more than once during every survey. Our results indicate that (1) in comparison to autumn, parr moved closer to the shoreline during winter; (2) parr performed longer movements during autumn and freeze-up than during mid winter and late winter; and (3) within the range of naturally occurring fluctuations, no differences in the mobility pattern of parr was observed in relation to water discharge. However, parr moved less at low water temperatures. Further, we discuss the results on distribution and mobility of parr during winter in perspective to the potential effects of hydro regulation.",,,,,"Enders, Eva/G-9804-2019; Enders, Eva/A-7818-2009","Enders, Eva/0000-0003-2103-0359; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-8158,,,,,SEP,2008,609,,,,,,37,44,,10.1007/s10750-008-9401-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9401-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000256928400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

As these individuals lose the capacity to maintain stable, optimal internal environments (i.e., as their homeostatic capacity declines), they become increasingly vulnerable to external stress. To model homeostatic capacity for predicting this vulnerability, a variety of regulated physiologic variables may be monitored prospectively. They include the maintenance of deep body temperature and heart rate, as well as the circadian oscillations around these set-points. Examples are provided of the disruptive changes shown by these variables in inbred mice as the animals approach death.

Genes responsive to abscisic acid signaling and cell wall degradation were upregulated during abscission, consistent with the increased abscisic acid concentrations detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We performed ex vivo cold shock experiments with excised tree subunits consisting of a branch, pedicel, and fruit. Abscission induction occurred in the cold-stressed subunits with concurrent upregulation of abscisic acid biosynthesis (MdNCED1) and metabolism (MdCYP707A) genes, and ethylene biosynthesis (MdACS1) and receptor (MdETR2) genes in the pedicel.

Theoretical models postulate that thermal specialization should be favored either when little environmental variation is experienced within generations or when among-generation variation is small relative to within-generation variation. To test these predictions, we studied six temperate species of damselflies differing in latitudinal distribution. We developed a computer model simulating how organisms experience environmental variation (accounting for diapause and voltinism) and performed a laboratory experiment assaying thermal sensitivities of growth rates. The computer model showed opposing latitudinal trends in among-and within-generation thermal variability: within-generation thermal variability decreased toward higher latitudes, whereas relative levels of among-generation thermal variability peaked at midlatitudes (where a shift in voltinism occurred). The growth experiment showed that low-latitude species were more thermally generalized than mid- and high-latitude species, supporting the prediction that generalists are favored under high levels of within-generation variation. Northern species had steeper, near-exponential reaction norms suggestive of thermal specialization. However, they had strikingly high thermal optima and grew very slowly over most of the thermal range they are expected to experience in the field. This observation is at present difficult to explain.

Upwind sites were 1 degrees C colder, on average, than downwind sites and had more variable water temperatures. The ranges of mean water temperatures and of water temperature variability were greater among upwind sites than among downwind sites. We used water temperature variability as a proxy for environmental variability. Total algal biovolume was similar at all sites, but the composition of these communities varied systematically with temperature variability. An observed shift in the relative dominance between Achnanthidium minutissimum, Surirella sp. and Pinnularia spp. is consistent with what we know about these species. Diatom richness increased from 12 to 15 genera with increasing variability at upwind (p = 0.10, r(2) = 0.65) and downwind sites (p = 0.11, r(2) = 0.63). Community evenness also increased with increasing variability (p = 0.03, r(2) = 0.82 at upwind sites; p = 0.0002, r(2) = 0.99 at downwind sites). These relationships were observed despite low nutrient and light availability, as well as the presence of grazers. Furthermore, environmental variability affected diatom communities in the presence of several competing factors (temperature, light, nutrients and disturbance). Our results suggest that increased environmental variability can lead to higher biodiversity in a complex natural system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,NOV,2006,115,2,,,,,197,206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000241198800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we characterize the functional roles of genes belonging to four distinct families of HSPs (hsp40, hsp60, hsp70, and hsp90) in the monogonont rotifer Brachionus manjavacas. Because B. manjavacas inhabits ponds of varying thermal regimes, including ephemeral ponds that may experience temperature fluctuations, HSP-mediated thermotolerance likely is important to its survival and adaptation. Using interference RNA (RNAi), we provide the first conclusive evidence that HSPs are required for rotifer survival following heat stress. Effective RNAi-mediated suppression of all hsp genes except hsp90 was verified via quantitative PCR. Hsp40, hsp60, and hsp70 are required for rotifer thermotolerance (P<0.05); however, our data do not indicate hsp90 is essential. Quantitative PCR further revealed immediate up-regulation of hsp40 mRNA following heat stress. Additionally, we demonstrated expression of hsp40 mRNA in multiple tissues using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Our characterization of mRNA expression and functional roles for four distinct hsp genes provides a baseline for molecular-level comparisons of the stress response of rotifers with other taxonomic groups, and the technique for in-depth studies of the role of specific genes in rotifer stress responses. Considering the potential for ambient temperatures to impact species survival, competitive interactions, and body size of individuals, thermotolerance may be an important influence on zooplankton community structure.

Temperatures in New Zealand were as much as 3 degrees C below average, with heavy rain and unusual snow. The oceanic surface layer in the southwest Pacific was also anomalously cold over the same period. A World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) hydrographic section (P14C) between Auckland and Fiji during September 1992 found cold sea surface temperatures and deep mixed layers near New Zealand when compared to 8 years of high-resolution expendable bathy thermograph (XBT) temperature measurements collected along the same transect. High nutrient and low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the surface layer indicated recent entrainment of thermocline waters. The Auckland to Fiji XBT section is ope of three WOCE high-resolution XBT survey lines in the ''Tasman Box'' region, whose boundaries are Auckland-Fiji, Fiji-Brisbane and Wellington-Sydney transects plus the Australian coast. Geostrophic shear and transport were estimated from 10 realizations of the Tasman Box during the period 1991-1993. The time series of geostrophic transport shows that following a convergence in late 1991, early in 1992 there was a substantial divergence of mass in the upper waters, equivalent to a thinning of the warm water layer. The phase of this anomalous divergence is matched to an observed amplification of the seasonal oceanic heat storage cycle in 1991-1992. The top 200-m average temperature was warmer in the 1992 summer than in 1991 or 1993, but the winter of 1992 was the coldest of the 8-year record along the Auckland-Fiji line. The divergence (thinning) of the warm water layer appears to have preconditioned the region for the exceptionally cold 1992 winter. The alternative, cool conditions from anomalous air-sea heat exchange caused by variability in the wind field, is considered unlikely as large fluctuations in heat loss are not observed in the air-sea flux data during this period. The severe weather conditions and anomalous ocean heat transport are most likely related to the prolonged El Nino-Southern Oscillation episode that began in early 1991.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,AUG 15,1995,100,C8,,,,,15865,15871,,10.1029/95JC01664,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95JC01664,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995RP99900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature and radiant energy effects on litter decomposition have been widely documented. However, under field conditions in drylands where soil-litter mixing occurs and accelerates decomposition, the mechanisms involved with soil-litter mixing effects are ambiguous. Potential mechanisms may include some combination of enhanced microbial colonization of litter, physical abrasion of litter surfaces, and buffering of litter and its associated decomposers from high temperatures and low moisture conditions. Here, we tested how soil-litter mixing and soil moisture interact to influence rates of litter decomposition in a controlled environment. Foliar litter of two plant species (a grass [Eragrostis lehmanniana] and a shrub [Prosopis velutina]) was incubated for 32 weeks in a factorial combination of soil-litter mixing (none, light, and complete) and soil water content (2, 4, 12% water-filled porosity) treatments. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were quantified one week into the experiment to evaluate initial microbial colonization. A complementary incubation experiment with simulated rainfall pulses tested the buffering effects of soil-litter mixing on decomposition. Under the laboratory conditions of our experiments, the influence of soil-litter mixing was minimal and primarily confined to changes in PLFAs during the initial stages of decomposition in the constant soil moisture experiment and the oscillating soil moisture conditions of the rainfall pulse experiment. Soil-litter mixing effects on CO2 production, total phospholipid concentrations, and bacterial to total PLFA ratios were observed within the first week, but responses were fairly weak and varied with litter type and soil moisture treatment. Across the entire 32-week incubation experiment, soil moisture had a significant positive effect on mass loss, but soil-litter mixing did not. The lack of strong soil-litter mixing effects on decomposition under the moderate and relatively constant environmental conditions of this study is in contrast to results from field studies and suggests the importance of soil-litter mixing may be magnified when the fluctuations and extremes in temperature, radiant energy and moisture regimes common dryland field settings are in play.

The risk of out-of-season summer rain requires species from such environments to adopt appropriate strategies to protect their seed banks. The seed bank strategies of the grasses from these environments have, so far, received little attention. We conducted an experiment to observe the dormancy release characteristics of 3 grasses common to these environments when stored under contrasting thermal regimes. The grasses studied were great brome grass (Bromus diandrus Roth), annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.), and barley grass (Hordeum leporinum Link). The different species displayed contrasting dormancy release characteristics over the summer. Two of the species examined (great brome grass and annual ryegrass) displayed relatively late release from dormancy which gave high levels of protection from false breaks. The other (barley grass) displayed earlier release from dormancy which would enable it to better exploit earlier true breaks but make it more sensitive to false breaks. Unlike pasture legumes, high and fluctuating temperatures were not necessary for the seeds of these grasses to become germinable. In fact, exposure to high temperatures appeared more likely to suppress release from dormancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0816-1089,,,,,,1999,39,2,,,,,143,147,,10.1071/EA98139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA98139,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000080958300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The 1-ha experimental area was divided in half by a range of herbaceous plants (2 m in width and 80 m in length). Beetle samples were collected using pitfall traps every fortnight during the in-season and every month during the off-season (a total of 27 sampling occurrences). Population fluctuation was analyzed by correlating the total number of specimens with plant phenology. We used multiple regression analysis with variable (stepwise) selection to examine the influence of meteorological factors on species occurrence. To determine the spatial distribution, data were analyzed using dispersion indices and probabilistic models based on the Coleoptera frequency distribution.

Kelp forests create some of the most productive habitats in the world, but globally, many populations have been negatively impacted by multiple anthropogenic stressors. Here, we compare the physiological and molecular responses to ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) of two populations of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera from distinct upwelling conditions (weak vs strong). Using laboratory mesocosm experiments, we found that juvenile Macrocystis sporophyte responses to OW and OA did not differ among populations: elevated temperature reduced growth while OA had no effect on growth and photosynthesis. However, we observed higher growth rates and NO3- assimilation, and enhanced expression of metabolic-genes involved in the NO3- and CO2 assimilation in individuals from the strong upwelling site. Our results suggest that despite no inter-population differences in response to OA and OW, intrinsic differences among populations might be related to their natural variability in CO2, NO3- and seawater temperatures driven by coastal upwelling.

Simulated transport was performed in plastic containers (volume 60 1) for 48 h. Water samples were taken at 4-h intervals after transport for the determination of pH, carbon dioxide (CO2) un-ionised ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+). Additionally, liver samples were collected at 4 and 48 h for glycogen determination. There were no statistically significant fluctuations in dissolved CO2 concentration in all tested conditions. Stocking density did not affect NH3 and NH4+ average values and hepatic glycogen content in groups exposed to a water renewal rate of 100%, while increasing NH3 and NH4+ average values with increasing stocking density was observed in groups with no water renewal. Under the same stocking density, a significant change in NH3 and NH4+ fluctuations over the duration of the experiment was observed with concentrations increasing, with a mean exponential rate (+/- SD) of 0.060 +/- 0.005 (NH3) and 0.062 +/- 0.005 (NH4+) per hour in groups with no water renewal, and -0.033 +/- 0.004 (NH3) and -0.024 +/- 0.007 (NH4+) per hour in groups with 100% water renewal. Water temperature affected significantly the hepatic glycogen content and survival during transport. There was no significant effect of salinity and anaesthetic (except at a dose of 50 ppm) on fry survival and on the water quality parameters. It is suggested that red porgy should be transported in stocking densities of 20-25 kg/m(3) and at a hauling temperature similar to that kept at the exporter's fish rearing tanks (preferable 19 degreesC).

For the experiment, the broodstock were separated into five groups (Group 1: Control, Group 2: Serotonin-injected, Group 3: Ablated, Group 4: Temperature-fluctuated, and Group 5: Another ablated groups). Each of the first four groups were stocked into a 2-m diameter round tank at density of 9.44 shrimps per m(2) (2:1, female/male), while Group 5 were stocked into a 3-m diameter tank at density of 5.67 shrimps per m(2)(1:1, female/male). The experiment continued for 2 months until maturation in a recirculation system. Each female was tagged and any ripe female carrying a spermatophore was removed to spawn individually in a spawning tank. The first spawnings occurred on 25-28(th) days of the experiment in all the groups. The highest female spawning rate (55-90%) and fecundity (79,778-125,015 eggs) were obtained in the eyestalk-ablated groups (P<0.05). Serotonin (Group 2) induced ovarium development in 35% of the females, generating 60,277 eggs per female. Cyclic temperature fluctuation (Group 4) stimulated ovarium maturation in 39% of the females with a mean fecundity of 28,500 egg per female (P<0.05). Mean egg fertility rates ranged from 63.08 A to 96%, and hatching rates from 8.53% to 31%. Spawning, fecundity and hatching rates were found to be different between the two eyestalk-ablated groups (Group 3 and 5), and the reasons were thought to be due to tank size and/or shrimp stocking density.

The film acts like a greenhouse, elevating temperatures and improving soil water. We examined the potential of polymer film to improve emergence and persistence of direct-seeded native vegetation. A seed mix comprising three tree species and two shrubs was sown in early August 2015, with and without polymer film. The effect of duration of polymer film (from 0-10 weeks) on emergence and persistence was tested, and the effects of polymer film on temperature and soil moisture were monitored. Our hypothesis that polymer film would improve emergence was partially supported, with between 6 and 10 weeks of polymer film coverage increasing emergence of small-seeded species above the level of the Control. The polymer film increased temperatures by an average of 5 degrees C and volumetric water content by up to 10%, compared with ambient conditions, and reduced fluctuations in soil moisture, which may have contributed to the increased emergence observed. Emergence was low across all treatments (range 0.2-47%). Our hypothesis that polymer film would improve persistence was not supported, with seedling numbers declining rapidly following removal of the polymer film and no differences between treatments in percentage persistence by the end of the experiment. We concluded that polymer film is a potentially useful tool for improving emergence of smaller-seeded species in direct seeding for land restoration, although provided no benefit for emergence of the larger-seeded species.

The present study focuses on enchytraeids (Oligochaeta) of heathland ecosystems and how the enchytraeid community has responded to simulated climate change in a long-term field experiment. Either increased temperature or repeated drought was applied for 13 years to field plots located in Wales, The Netherlands and Denmark representing a gradient in precipitation and annual temperature fluctuations thereby providing an opportunity to study biological responses on a local (within sites) and regional scale. Warming treatments increasing night-time temperature (0.5-1 degrees C higher than ambient at 5 cm soil depth) had no detectable effects on the enchytraeid communities. Increased intensity and frequency of drought had rather weak persistent effects on total enchytraeid abundance suggesting that ecosystem functions of enchytraeids may only be transiently impacted by repeated spring or summer drought. However, drought treatment had persistent negative effects on species richness and community structure across sites. Drought treated plots harboured only 35-65% of the species present in control plots, and the reduction of species richness was most pronounced at the driest sites. It is discussed that soil invertebrates, due to their weak migratory potential, may be more liable to extinction under changing climatic conditions than above-ground species, and therefore consequences of climate change to soil organisms need particular attention in future research.

Under natural conditions, three replicate experiments were conducted in which water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total ammonia, unionised ammonia, phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton (number of living and dead organisms, mortality rate and instant mortality) were studied. The time-course of unionised ammonia concentration was consistent with those shown by temperature, pH, phytoplankton biomass, dissolved oxygen, Moina micrura mortality and Brachionus rubens mortality. On the other hand, temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen never exceeded the tolerance ranges described for Moina and Brachionus, which led us to attribute the cause of zooplankton mortality to unionised ammonia toxicity. Mortality rates of 63%, 27% and 34% were recorded for Moina in each replicate experiment. Brachionus was less affected, with mortalities of 7.3%, 6.2% and 6.0%. These results confirm previous field observations (Water Res. 34(14) (2000) 3666; Water Res. 37(5) (2003) 1048) that attributed a reduction in zooplankton biomass during certain periods of summer (algal blooms) to a harmful side-effect of an excessive increase in phytoplankton biomass: high photosynthetic activity during these periods of proliferation of algae gives rise to an increased pH (greater than or equal to8) and, subsequently, leads to production of unionised ammonia (toxic for aquatic organisms) from its ionised fraction.

However, the influence of environmental and ecophysiological variables and seasonal differences on Porphyra/Pyropia (microhabitats) intertidal distributions is unknown. Accordingly, we determined (i) the effect of environmental variables (temperature [T], relative humidity [RH], and photosynthetically active radiation [PAR]) and season on distribution, and (ii) physiological (cellular activity and lipid peroxidation [LPX]) and molecular responses (antioxidant enzymes expression at biochemical and transcript level) to desiccation stress in both Pyropia species and morphotypes (common garden experiment, on flat rocky platforms). Multivariate analyses of coverage and abundance in relation to environmental variables revealed a significant effect of temperature on P. variabilis GM distribution, GM dominating almost exclusively on rocky walls (where lowest PAR and T values but maximum RH were registered). Conversely, Pyropia orbicularis and Pyropia variabilis LM were found in high abundance on flat rocky platforms in summer, LM and GM also dominating flat rocky platforms in winter and spring. LPX and catalase activity did not differed among species in summer, while in winter activity and transcription of cat were higher in P. orbicularis than P. variabilis.

Because the gas has various well-documented effects on seed physiology, we asked whether it can be a vital seed germination cue for wetland plants. Specifically, we explored whether ethylene plays an ecological role in (i) breaking/weakening seed dormancy, (ii) broadening the germination niche width, (iii) promoting germination speed or (iv) altering the germination requirements of six plant species with different occurrence along a hydroperiod gradient. In a factorial experiment, both ethylene-treated and untreated seeds were incubated in combinations of temperature (constant versus fluctuating), illumination (light versus darkness) and oxygen (aerobic versus hypoxia) with and without cold stratification. Our results revealed seed exposure to ethylene did not weaken or break dormancy without cold stratification treatment. However, ethylene helped to broaden the germination niche width, increased overall germination percentage and speed of cold-stratified (non-dormant) seeds. This indicates that ethylene helps those seeds that lost dormancy (non-dormant) to sense favourable water-saturated versus flooded substrate depending on their requirement for aerobic versus hypoxic conditions to trigger germination. We conclude that ethylene does not interfere directly with the dormancy-breaking process in autumn-dispersed seeds that are naturally cold-stratified in winter and germinate in spring/summer. However, ethylene plays a crucial ecological role as a 'flood detector' for different wetland plant communities (reed, mudflat, swamp, shallow water) to synchronize germination of non-dormant seeds in the most suitable habitat at the right time.",,,,,"; Rosbakh, Sergey/AAO-8524-2020","PHARTYAL, Shyam/0000-0003-3266-6619; Rosbakh, Sergey/0000-0002-4599-6943",,,,,,,,,,,,,1435-8603,1438-8677,,,,MAR,2022,24,2,,,,,278,285,,10.1111/plb.13385,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/plb.13385,,JAN 2022,,,,,,34990068,,,,,WOS:000739540700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such variation may be driven by meteorological conditions and cultivar-specific traits. We conducted an outdoor seedling experiment to determine the effects of different cultivars on the establishment of introduced predatory mites (Euseius stipulatus and E. scutalis) and colonization by naturally occurring phytoseiids (Amblyseius swirskii, Iphiseius degenerans, and Typhlodromus athiasae) across seasons. Euseius stipulatus persisted through the spring only where it was released, regardless of cultivar, and reduced colonization by I. degenerans. In early summer (hot and dry conditions), nearly all phytoseiid species essentially disappeared, and after that only the naturally occurring A. swirskii and T. athiasae re-established. In mid-summer, A. swirskii colonized cultivars differentially, especially where pollen was provisioned, and was negatively related with the colonization of T. athiasae, which is known as its intraguild prey. Additionally, we performed laboratory experiments that simulated daily temperature fluctuations typical to spring and mid-summer seasons, measuring key demographic parameters of A. swirskii and E. stipulatus on leaf disc arenas of two citrus cultivars. Simulated spring temperatures resulted in higher total reproductive output in E. stipulatus than in A. swirskii, whereas mid-summer temperatures resulted in the opposite pattern. Both results are consistent with the seasonal patterns observed in the outdoor experiment.

Experiments were executed on control plants, on previously desiccated then rehydrated plants, and on continuously hydrated plants to determine if prior desiccation influenced the response to light. Soil and xylem water potential and temperature were monitored and used as covariates in analyses. The results showed that carbon gain in the spring greatly exceeded that of any other season. Despite this, there was little change in the photosynthetic response to light on a seasonal basis even though plants were exposed to highly variable and highly limited light most of the time. Prior desiccation had a slight influence on photosynthetic rate but not on other photosynthetic parameters such as the light compensation point and L(half). Temperature was a significant seasonal covariate and additional experiments conducted in the laboratory showed that the response of photosynthesis to temperature was broad. Xylem water potential was correlated with seasonal changes in relative humidity.

This species has been of economic concern because NIA can be a costly nuisance for bivalve aquaculture. The presence of this temperate-adapted species in Newfoundland represents an extension of its global range into subarctic waters. In 2010 and 2011, we investigated the population dynamics of B. schlosseri in Arnold's Cove, Placentia Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Experiments testing the influence of season, depth, and substrate type on larval recruitment rates were conducted within the harbour over a period of 20 mo. Seasonal cycle of colony (adult) abundance was determined from video surveys of a belt transect of the wharf. The seasonal window of recruitment was from August to mid-October (ca. 2.5 mo), constrained to temperatures >= 13 degrees C. Peak recruitment was observed coincident with maximum seasonal temperature in September. Recruitment was greatest at 1 m depth on PVC plates. Colonies were present year-round on wharf structures and exhibited seasonal fluctuations in percent cover, from < 1% in May to ca. 3% in October. Seasonal increase in colony abundance was constrained to temperatures >= 5 degrees C. These findings provide a population-level understanding of how a temperate-adapted, non-indigenous species is established and maintained in a subarctic environment.

An examination of annual mean surface temperature changes at decadal intervals associated with the increasing CO2, indicated that it takes 60-70 years before temperature fluctuations due to natural climatic variability are finally overwhelmed by the greenhouse effect. Surface temperatures at 3 x CO2, under transient conditions were similar to those obtained under 2 x CO2, equilibrium conditions with a slab ocean, except for much reduced warmings in high southern latitudes. Time series of climatic variables for selected variables for the control and transient runs revealed noticeable interannual and decadal fluctuations in both runs, and highlighted the potential problems of 'sampling' data at arbitrary timeframes. The model maintained El Nino/Southern Oscillation events throughout the transient run, suggesting that this feature is a robust characteristic of the climatic system. No untoward climatic fluctuations were noted during the transient run, implying that climatic 'surprises' are unlikely, at least for present model formulations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Raman lines appearing close to it, however, obscure the true line profile. To isolate this from its accompanying lines we use its isotopic shift of similar to1 cm(-1) when Fe-56 in natural-abundance deoxymyoglobin is substituted by Fe-54. This enables us to isolate the true line shape. We have measured this line shape in sperm whale myoglobin dissolved in a 66% vol/vol glycerol/water solution for nine temperatures from 10 K to 300 K. The nu (Fe-His) band shows a complex temperature-dependent profile, with a shoulder on its high-frequency wing, which becomes more prominent with increasing temperature.

These are in thermodynamic equilibrium above the glass transition temperature T-f but freeze in into the thermodynamic distribution at T-f for lower temperatures. Alternative models that try to explain the nu (Fe-His) band shape by either an anharmonic coupling of the nu (Fe-His) to a low-frequency heme doming mode or by conformational substates related to a Gaussian distribution of iron out-of-plane displacements are at variance with the distinct features observed experimentally.",,,,,"Schweitzer-Stenner, Reinhard/AAV-1058-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3495,,,,,SEP,2001,81,3,,,,,1624,1631,,10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75816-X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(01)75816-X,,,,,,,,11509375,,,,,WOS:000170600800038,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results of simulation experiments employing a benthic chamber under various redox conditions",MARINE CHEMISTRY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The rapidly expanding industry of marine cage fish farming of sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in the Mediterranean Sea over the last decade has often had damaging effects on the benthic aquatic environment near the fish farm installations. It has been observed that the food-remains, together with the pellets and metabolic products from fish, frequently form a nepheloid sediment layer covering large areas of the seabed. Under these conditions anoxia and/or hypoxia develop and affect benthic communities while the quality of the marine environment deteriorates for long periods, extending even beyond the life span of the fish farm itself. In most cases the affected areas act initially as sediment traps and in a second phase as secondary sources of organic carbon, nutrients and other substances. The aim of this paper is to explore the behaviour of such an affected area under different redox regimes by measuring the fluxes of ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, TDN, phosphate, TDP and silicate between the surface sediment and the overlying waters. To achieve this goal we constructed a prototype benthic chamber capable of sampling considerable quantities of affected undisturbed sediment along with its overlying water. The chamber was transported to the laboratory where simulation experiments reproducing the conditions occurring in nature, including the extreme ones, were carried out and studied carefully. The chamber allows the full and fine control of the dissolved oxygen concentration - and thus of the redox potential - as well as water temperature while subsamples of both water and sediment could be obtained and analysed for a series of chemical substances. The controlled laboratory chamber experiments reproduced four successional phases: 1) deoxygenation, 2) hypoxia, 3) reoxygenation and 4) anoxia. The results showed that even minor changes in the redox conditions at a relatively narrow zone near the water sediment interface have significant impacts on the concentrations of dissolved nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate compounds. With decreasing oxygen supply (phases 1, 2 and 4), the concentrations of ammonium, nitrite, TDN, phosphate, TDP and silicate rapidly increase, those of nitrate decrease. DON and DOP exhibit remarkable fluctuations. During reoxygenation (phase 3) the concentrations of ammonium stabilise, the nitrate concentration decreases while nitrite shows an increasing trend. Decreases in phosphate and silicate concentrations were also observed paralleled by TDP stabilization and DOP increasing trend. TDN shows a relatively small increase while the DON concentration fluctuates significantly.

The chemical composition of vegetables is genetically determined as well as being modified by factors affecting the plant during growth, and particularly climatic conditions and agro-technology practices. The effects of soil mulching with rye, corn, rape and buckwheat straw at a dose of 10 and 20 t ha(-1) on the yield and changes of selected components of nutritive value in 'Milady' F-1 broccoli and 'Polfast' F-1 tomato were investigated. The effect of straw was compared to a control plot without mulch. The yield of the vegetables and their chemical composition depended to a higher degree on weather conditions in the years of study. 2010 was the most favourable for broccoli yielding and 2011 for tomato. More nutrients components in heads and fruits were found in 2011 and 2012, which were characterised by favourable rainfall distribution. All straws applied in the experiment, irrespective of dosage, caused an increase in broccoli yield. However, soil mulching with straw at a dose of 10 t ha(-1) was better for tomato yielding. Soil mulching with rye, corn and buckwheat straw increased the share of marketable yield in the total yield of broccoli and rye straw as well as the share of marketable yield of tomato. Mulching with rape and buckwheat straw decreased dry matter content in the edible parts of the vegetables. Mulch with rye straw contributed to a decreased content of ascorbic acid in heads and fruits and also caused a slight reduction in tomato flesh acidity.

Results: Here, we test the effect of different environmental regimes (constant versus fluctuating temperature) on bacterial biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relations.

The front involves a temperature change of 1degrees-2degreesC, with a southward jet of greater than 0.5 m s(-1) over a width of 1-2 km in 25 m of water.

Monoterpene (MT) and sesquiterpene (SQT) emissions rates were quantified in a total of 1236 individual branch enclosure samples. MT dominated coniferous emissions, producing greater than 95% of BVOC emissions. MT and SQT demonstrated short-term emission dependence with temperature. Two oxygenated MT, 1,8-cineol and piperitone, were both light and temperature dependent. Basal emission rates (BER, normalized to 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 30 degrees C) were generally higher in spring and summer than in winter; MT seasonal BER from the coniferous trees maximized between 1.5 and 6.0 mu g g(-1), h(-1), while seasonal lows were near 0.1 mu g g(-1) h(-1). The fractional contribution of individual MT to total emissions was found to fluctuate with season. SQT BER measured from the coniferous trees ranged from <0.01 to 0.15 mu g g(-1) h(-1). BER of up to 1.2 mu g g(-1) h(-1) of the SQT germacrene B were found from Q gambelii, peaking in late summer. The beta-factor, used to define temperature dependence in emissions modeling, was not found to exhibit discernible growth season trends. A seasonal correction factor proposed by others in previous work to account for a sinusoidal shaped emission pattern was applied to the data. Varying levels of agreement were found between the data and model results for the different plant species seasonal data sets using this correction. Consequently, the analyses on this extensive data set suggest that it is not feasible to apply a universal seasonal correction factor across different vegetation species. A modeling exercise comparing two case scenarios, (1) without and (2) with consideration of the seasonal changes in emission factors illustrated large deviations when emission factors are applied for other seasons than those in which they were experimentally determined.

A reduction in snow cover due to warmer atmospheric temperature in formerly cold ecosystems, however, could counteract an increase in soil temperature by reduction of insulation. Thus, soil freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) might increase in frequency and magnitude with warming, potentially leading to a disturbance of the soil biota and release of nutrients. Here, we assessed how soil freeze-thaw magnitude and frequency affect short-term release of nutrients in temperate deciduous forest soils by conducting a three-factorial gradient experiment with ex situ soil samples in climate chambers. The fully crossed experiment included soils from forests dominated by Fagus sylvatica (European beech) that originate from different winter climate (mean coldest month temperature range Delta T >4 K), a range of FTC magnitudes from no (T = 4.0 degrees C) to strong (T = -11.3 degrees C) soil frost, and a range of FTC frequencies (f = 0-7). We hypothesized that higher FTC magnitude and frequency will increase the release of nutrients. Furthermore, soils from cold climates with historically stable winter soil temperatures due to deep snow cover will be more responsive to FTCs than soils from warmer, more fluctuating winter soil climates. FTC magnitude and, to a lesser extent, also FTC frequency resulted in increased nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate release almost exclusively in soils from cold, snow-rich sites. The hierarchical regression analyses of our three-factorial gradient experiment revealed that the effects of climatic origin (mean minimum winter temperature) followed a sigmoidal curve for all studied nutrients and was modulated either by FTC magnitude (phosphate) or by FTC magnitude and frequency (nitrate, ammonium) in complex twofold and, for all studied nutrients, in threefold interactions of the environmental drivers. Compared to initial concentrations, soluble nutrients were predicted to increase to 250 % for nitrate (up to 16 mu g NO3-N kg(-1)DM), to 110 % for ammonium (up to 60 mu g NH4-N kg(-1)DM), and to 400 % for phosphate (2.2 mu g PO4-P kg(-1)DM) at the coldest site for the strongest magnitude and highest frequency. Soils from warmer sites showed little nutrient release and were largely unaffected by the FTC treatments except for above-average nitrate release at the warmest sites in response to extremely cold FTC magnitude. We suggest that currently warmer forest soils have historically already passed the point of high responsiveness to winter climate change, displaying some form of adaptation either in the soil biotic composition or in labile nutrient sources. Our data suggest that previously cold sites, which will lose their protective snow cover during climate change, are most vulnerable to increasing FTC frequency and magnitude, resulting in strong shifts in nitrogen and phosphorus release. In nutrient-poor European beech forests of the studied Pleistocene lowlands, nutrients released over winter may be leached out, inducing reduced plant growth rates in the following growing season.",,,,,"Weigel, Robert/U-1954-2019","Weigel, Robert/0000-0001-9685-6783; Schumann, Rhena/0000-0002-0605-3379; Kreyling, Juergen/0000-0001-8489-7289",,,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,AUG 13,2020,17,15,,,,,4103,4117,,10.5194/bg-17-4103-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4103-2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000562942400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In all experiments, tested levels of hypoxia or ammonia concentrationswere applied to embryos and unfed newly hatched larvae from three different spawns. Exposures began at 1 h post fertilization (pf) and lasted until all individuals in a group had expired. Survival rates were monitored daily in duplicates for each spawn in each treatment. Fertilized eggs exposed to 2 mg L-1 dissolved oxygen (29% saturation) showed complete mortality before hatch while 81% of embryos in control groups (>85% saturation) hatched and subsequently maintained high survival until 5 days pf. Exposure to a moderate hypoxia (target 3 mg L-1, 43% saturation) reduced significantly the hatch rate and subsequent survival rates; the magnitude of the difference in survival rate between control and exposed groups increased from 10% at hatch to 45% at 5 days pf. When oxygen concentration was maintained high (83% saturation) until 36 h pf and then progressively reduced to reach 3 mg L-1 at 2 days pf, the survival of exposed embryos and larvae did not differ significantly from those recorded in control groups, although potential delayed or cumulative effects of the treatment after 4 days pf could not be evaluated in this experiment. Embryos exposed to 10 mg L-1 total ammonia (TA-N), which corresponded to unionized ammonia (UIA-N) concentrations ranging between 0.307 and 0.468 mg L-1 in the conditions of the experiment, exhibited significantly reduced hatch rates and complete mortality between 3 and 4 days pf; the latter period corresponds to the onset of exogenous feeding of red snapper. In contrast, control groups (TA-N < 0.26 mg L-1, UIA-N < 0.006 mg L-1) maintained high survival rates beyond 5 days pf indicating potential to successfully initiate exogenous feeding. Exposure to 1 mg L-1 TA-N (0.020 mg L-1 < UIA-N < 0.054 mg L-1) did not alter significantly survival with respect to control groups. Significant interactions between the spawn and the tolerance to hypoxia or elevated ammonia were detected in both experiments, indicating that variations among spawns need to be accounted for when determining safe levels for hatchery production. Statement of relevance Achieving a reliable supply of high quality eggs and larvae is one of the main challenges of the developing marine aquaculture industry. Most studies to date have focused on maternal determinants of egg quality but the viability of embryos and newly hatched larvae can be impacted after fertilization if environmental conditions become unfavorable due to intensive hatchery conditions; this topic is poorly documented in marine fishes to date. This study provides data on the effects of two major stressors acting under high density culture (hypoxia and elevated ammonia concentration) on embryos and newly hatched larvae of the red snapper; the results highlight the importance to consider variations among spawns/parents when determining safe levels for hatchery production and also the high sensitivity of red snapper to these stresses, suggesting that this topic should be investigated in other marine offshore species.

In fully cold hardy plants of H. macrophylla stem freezing tolerance fluctuated in parallel with changes in air temperature, while in a seasonal perspective increased temperatures caused a sigmoid deacclimation pattern in both H. macrophylla and H. paniculata. Timing of deacclimation was approximately synchronized in the two species, but H. paniculata. the hardier species based on mid-winter hardiness, deacclimated faster than H. macrophylla, indicating that deacclimation kinetics were not correlated with mid-winter hardiness. In both species concentrations of soluble sugars decreased during deacclimation and were highly correlated with stem cold hardiness and air temperatures. This suggests that sugar hydrolysis may be an important temperature-driven mechanism of deacclimation in Hydrangea. Accumulation patterns of specific carbohydrates differed between the two species, suggesting that they utilize different strategies to overcome cold. In H. paniculata. deacclimation was associated with an increase in stem water content, which occurred shortly before bud burst and hence may be a prerequisite for leafing out. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

Five age groups (2-9 years) and three size groups: small (S, mean wet tissue mass 0.12 g), medium (M, mean wet tissue mass 0.39 g) and large (L, mean wet tissue mass 0.78 g) were analysed. Respiration rate was measured in closed respirometers. Pumping rate was determined by a laser beam to monitor the changes in water level when the inhalant and exhalant siphons were in separate compartments of the aquarium. To study their response to environmental stress, the mussels were subjected to cyclic salinity fluctuations at normal (10 degreesC) and elevated (20 degreesC) temperatures. Two parameters were noted: (1) the salinity at which shell valves either opened or closed at both temperatures, and (2) intra-individual variation of the behavioural response to salinity changes at both temperatures. Size and age affect physiological processes in the blue mussel. The responses of M edulis to environmental stress including low salinity, elevated temperature and air exposure as well as respiration rate are generally size-dependent. Effects of age on sensitivity to low salinity and survival in air are minor. Pumping rates of mussels are significantly affected by both size and age of the animals.

We noted that the non-breaking wave dominates epsilon values within the surface layer. While analyzing the vertical epsilon variability, the presence of a wave-affected layer from the water surface to a depth of z approximate to 1.25 lambda(w) is observed, where lambda(w) is the wavelength. epsilon associated with non-breaking waves ranged to 4.9 x 10(-6)-7 x 10(-6) m(2)/s(3) for the wavelength range of 0.038 m < lambda(w) < 0.098 m categorized as the gravity and gravity-capillary wave regimes. epsilon values increase for longer lambda(w) and non-breaking wave epsilon values represent their significant contribution to the ocean energy budget and dynamic of surface layer considering that the non-breaking wave covers the large fraction of ocean surface. We also found that the surface mean square slope (MSS) and wave generated epsilon have the same order of magnitude, i.e., MSS similar to epsilon. Besides, we have documented that the small-scale temperature fluctuation change (i.e., chi) is consistent with the large-scale temperature gradient change (i.e., d < T > /d(z)).

Release of packaged material from these nanocontainers is associated with subtle conformational changes of the NP structure, which in vitro, is readily accomplished by heating. Characterizing the structural changes as a function of temperature may provide fresh insights into nanomaterial/antiviral strategies. Here, we have calculated heat induced changes in the properties of an empty minute virus of mice particle using large-scale approximate to 3.0 x 10(6) all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on two heat induced structural changes of the NP, namely, dynamical transition (DT) and breathing transition (BT), both characterized by sudden and sharp change of measured parameters at temperatures, T-DT and T-BT, respectively. While DT is assessed by mean-square fluctuation of hydrogen atoms of the NP, BT is monitored through internal volume and permeation rate of water molecules through the NP. Both the transitions, resulting primarily from collective atomistic motion, are found to occur at temperatures widely separated from one another (T-BT>T-DT). The breathing motions, responsible for the translocation events of the packaged materials through the NP to kick off, are further probed by computing atomic resolution stresses from NVE simulations. Distribution of equilibrium atomistic stresses on the NP reveals a largely asymmetric nature and suggests structural breathing may actually represent large dynamic changes in the hotspot regions, far from the NP pores, which is in remarkable resemblance with recently conducted hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry experiment.

How such a sensor can detect inclination is unclear, as granular materials like sand are known to display flow threshold and finite avalanche angle due to friction and interparticle jamming. Here, we address this issue by combining direct visualization of statolith avalanches in plant cells and experiments in biomimetic cells made of microfluidic cavities filled with a suspension of heavy Brownian particles. We show that, despite their granular nature, statoliths move and respond to the weakest angle, as a liquid clinometer would do. Comparison between the biological and biomimetic systems reveals that this liquid-like behavior comes from the cell activity, which agitates statoliths with an apparent temperature one order of magnitude larger than actual temperature. Our results shed light on the key role of active fluctuations of statoliths for explaining the remarkable sensitivity of plants to inclination. Our study also provides support to a recent scenario of gravity perception in plants, by bridging the active granular rheology of statoliths at the microscopic level to the macroscopic gravitropic response of the plant.",,,,,"Bérut, Antoine/ABA-6293-2021; Pouliquen, Olivier/AAU-8149-2021","Bérut, Antoine/0000-0001-8549-086X; Pouliquen, Olivier/0000-0002-2246-1137; Chauvet, Hugo/0000-0003-3243-0577; Legue, Valerie/0000-0003-2090-9580",,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,MAY 15,2018,115,20,,,,,5123,5128,,10.1073/pnas.1801895115,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1801895115,,,,,,,,29712863,,,,,WOS:000432120400043,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the dominant species as a recruit ( Clinocottus globiceps) was always replaced numerically as an adult by another species ( Oligocottus maculosus). When mechanisms of coexistence were evaluated, little support was found for either a lottery model, because competitive interactions are hierarchical, or a storage-effect model of coexistence, because the relative ranking of recruitment varied little among years and did not covary among species with environmental variables such as ocean temperature, upwelling indices, or an estimator of ocean productivity ( oyster condition index). There was also little evidence of niche partitioning based on habitat affinities. Additionally, predation-mediated coexistence had little support, given that the competitive dominant did not have the greatest rates of mortality. Instead, a competition-colonization trade-off may contribute to the coexistence of these species, where C. globiceps always recruits in the greatest numbers, while O. maculosus dominates the adult assemblage via competitive processes. The importance of post-recruitment processes in this assemblage is further suggested by some negative associations among species, the presence of density dependence, some habitat affinities, and previously published experimental work that demonstrated the competitive dominance of O. maculosus over C. globiceps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,NOV,2006,87,11,,,,,2905,2914,,10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2905:CBSEAL]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[2905:CBSEAL]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,17168034,,,,,WOS:000242214800022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The performance of ACCFHES was experimentally evaluated for a full winter and a summer season. The ACCFHES makes use of constant temperature aquifer water (24 degrees C) available at an agricultural field through an irrigation tube well for heating in winter nights and cooling in summer days. The results showed that the average greenhouse room air temperature was maintained 7-9 degrees C above the outside air during extreme winter nights and 6-7 degrees C below the outside air in extreme summer days, and temperature fluctuations inside the greenhouse also decreased daily. The average relative humidity (RH) inside the greenhouse also decreased by 10-12% in the winter and increased by more than double in the extreme summer conditions as compared to the outside conditions. A comparison of economic feasibility of the ACCFHES coupled greenhouse was also conducted with conventional greenhouse and open field condition based on the yield of Capsicum annum. The ACCFHES was also compared economically with other existing heating/cooling technologies such as earth-to-air heat exchanger system (EAHES), ground air collector, evaporative cooling using foggers and fan & pad system in terms of net present worth (NPW) and pay back period. It was observed that the NPW of the ACCFHES coupled greenhouse was much higher as compared to the conventional greenhouse and open field condition. The payback period of the ACCFHES coupled greenhouse was the lowest among all other existing heating/cooling systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Germination in the lab ranged from 0.05% to 67.9%, and was affected by light (5 species), temperature (6 species), fluctuating temperatures (4 species), moist chilling prior to germination (cold-stratification) (6 species), and dormancy-breaking by means of gibberellic acid (8 species). Seedling emergence in the field varied from 0.1% to 14.1%, and increased in low-competition microsites (bare-ground gaps and cut vegetation; 7 species), and showed seasonal timing (1 species in autumn and 1 species in spring), and seed carry-over across years (7 species). Lab germination responses successfully predicted microsite selectivity in the field and to some extent seed carry-over across years but not seasonal timing of germination. Gap-detecting species were generally small-seeded, low-growing, and found in unproductive habitats.

This study was carried out on two cherry producer counties, Lujan de Cuyo and Tupungato of Mendoza Province, Argentine. Those areas have experimented significant yields reduction each time the chilling offer was not enough. Because of this specie have specific physiologic requirement and these areas have great annual temperatures variability, it is necessary to study its climatic profile in reference to winter chilling. Lujan de Cuyo County had a mean of 1.106 CUUM, enough for varieties with low and intermediate requirements. Ninety percent of winters fluctuated between 824 and 1.388 CUUM. Consequently some years the chilling availability could be enough only for low chill requirements varieties. Tupungato has a mean of 1.445 CUUM, indicating that it was enough for high requirements varieties. However ninety percent of winters, CU oscillated between 1.152 y 1.738 CUUM indicating there was years that winter chilling was enough for intermediate requirements varieties. The estimated probability to attain 1.400 CUUM, at Lujan de Cuyo County was 18%, while at Tupungato County was 66%.

For this study, we measured a pair of X-ray based microdensitometry datasets using double samples of subfossil and recent wood specimens. Dendrochronological information of earlywood and latewood series was examined to determine for alterations in the resulting data. We found that the level of overall density, its trend over cambial ages and the growth amplitude altered due to the sample pretreatment/density measuring exercise, which means that comparisons of heterogeneous datasets should be, in general, regarded cautiously. Dendrochronological standardization did, however, even out several potentially biasing influences from the differing overall densities and their trends. The two latewood (maximum) density chronologies yielded paleoclimatic reconstructions which both calibrated and verified satisfactorily with the instrumental warm-season (March-September) mean temperatures.

A 1D version of the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) is used south of the Gran Canaria Island to simulate seasonal climatologies of these cycles.

The K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) mixed layer submodel is compared with other subtrodels using idealized numerical experiments. When forced with realistic air-sea fluxes, the model correctly reproduces the annual cycle of temperature (mixed layer depth), with minimum surface values of 18 degrees C (maximal depth > 105 m) in February during convective mixing resulting from a negative heat flux. Maximum temperatures above 23 degrees C (minimal depth <20 m) are simulated from September to October after strong summer heating and a decrease in Trade Winds intensity. A simple ecosystem model is coupled to the physical model, which provides simulated biological cycles that are in agreement with regional observations. A phytoplankton bloom develops in late winter, driven by the injection of new nutrients into the euphotic layer. Simulated chlorophyll shows a deep maximum fluctuating around 100 m with concentrations around 1 mg Chl(a) m(-3). white surface values are low (around 0.1 mg Chl(a) m(-3)) during most of the year.

It has been hypothesized that these periodic arousals are driven by the development of a metabolic imbalance during torpor; that is, the accumulation or the depletion of metabolites or the accrual of cellular damage that can be eliminated only in the euthermic state. We obtained oxygen consumption (as a proxy of metabolic rate) and Tb at 7 min intervals over entire torpor-arousal cycles in the garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus). Torpor bout duration was highly dependent on mean oxygen consumption during the torpor bout. Oxygen consumption during torpor, in turn, was elevated by Tb, which fluctuated only slightly in dormice kept at similar to 3-8 degrees C. This corresponds to awell-known effect of higher T-b on shortening torpor bout lengths in hibernators. Arousal duration was independent from prior torpor length, but arousal mean oxygen consumption increased with prior torpor T-b. These results, particularly the effect of torpor oxygen consumption on torpor bout length, point to an hourglass mechanism of torpor control, i.e. the correction of a metabolic imbalance during arousal. This conclusion is in line with previous comparative studies providing evidence for significant interspecific inverse relationships between the duration of torpor bouts and metabolism in torpor.

In the growing season, the fluctuation of soil respiration was particularly evident. The coefficients of variation (CVs) for soil respiration in different growing seasons ranged from 54% to 93%, and the annual CVs were all above 115%.

Fluctuations having a range of periods spanning the timescale for global recycling of the ocean volume through the thermocline are considered, with emphasis on inter-hemispheric 'see-saw' oscillations. Episodic sinking of dense water in the oceans is represented by convection in a channel with a base that is cooled over a central region and subjected to oscillatory heating near both ends, while providing a constant total heat input. For this simplified system the time-average interior temperature is found to be insensitive to the forcing period, but does vary with oscillation amplitude, whereas the interior fluctuations increase with forcing period. The circulation and density field are significantly different from those given by a steady forcing equal to the time-average of the actual oscillatory forcing, even for high-frequency oscillations. The results indicate that the overall stratification lies between that expected from the strongest phase of deep sinking and that given by symmetric sinking in both hemispheres.

Many successful invasive species have heightened thermal tolerance relative to their native counterparts, which may provide competitive advantages for habitat utilization and resource acquisition under warming scenarios, ultimately contributing to radically altered community composition. Enhanced transcriptional plasticity may be an important factor conferring superior abilities to cope with environmental stress, but the molecular mechanisms driving key differences of organismal traits in invasive versus native species are not well known. Although it is predicted that established invaders will evolve canalized phenotypes well-adapted to new environments, it is not clear whether the same expectations are true for invaders of variable thermal environments or under climate warming scenarios where abilities to cope with fluctuating and increasing temperatures may provide fitness advantages. Here, we compare a highly successful invasive fish and a sympatric endangered native fish living in a dynamic estuarine environment that is projected to warm under climate change. We linked organismal physiological limits with global transcriptional responses at multiple common relative and absolute temperature thresholds and determined that heightened thermal tolerance of invasive Inland Silversides (Menidia beryllina) is associated with transcriptional changes that are greater both in the number of genes and the magnitude of response relative to native Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Modulated genes contributed to the enrichment of biological processes that differed between species and generally increased with temperature. These results are in concordance with the hypothesis that transcriptional plasticity may play a key role in determining population persistence, species interactions, and shaping community assemblages under climate change. Future studies encompassing a wider range of species and taxa are needed to determine whether this is a general pattern found between native and invasive species more broadly.",,,,,,"Connon, Richard/0000-0002-9554-6705; verhille, christine/0000-0001-5453-7792",,,,,,,,,,,,,1752-4571,,,,,APR,2021,14,4,,,,,931,949,,10.1111/eva.13172,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.13172,,DEC 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000598632600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We coupled our previously developed hydrothermal time, thermal and hydrothermal afterripening time, and hydration-dehydration models for dormancy loss and germination with field seed zone temperature and water potential measurements from early summer through autumn to develop predictions of germination timing for Bromus tectorum at a semi-arid site in north-central Utah, USA. Model predictions were tested with a validation dataset based on concomitant seed retrieval experiments in 2 years. Predictions were generally in agreement with observed field germination time courses, even though integration across multiple precipitation events was necessary. Success of the modelling effort hinged on two factors. First, we used a soil capacitance sensor that measured seed zone (5 mm soil depth) water content accurately over a wide range. Second, simulations were built using physiologically based threshold models that can incorporate differences in germination timing for multiple germination fractions and for multiple stages of dormancy loss. Our results suggest that simulation models using hydrothermal time concepts can predict field germination phenology accurately. Seeds in this study integrated their experiences in a widely fluctuating environment in a manner consistent with the assumptions of hydrothermal time. Such threshold-based models also have the advantage of generality, as these concepts can be applied to many different species, environments and weather scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-2585,1475-2735,,,,DEC,2009,19,4,,,,,225,239,,10.1017/S0960258509990122,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0960258509990122,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000271994700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we addressed the study to a panel of selected landraces representing traditional genotypes that usually show high adaptation to local environments. In two experiments, spaced by 12 years, we set-up an identical experimental design with plants transplanted at two different dates to expose the second field to thermic stress with natural fluctuations. Such a strategy resulted in both a mild and severe stress in the two years. The landraces showed wide variation for both vegetative and reproductive traits; all traits were affected by heat, mostly with a significant Genotype*Environment interaction. A high broad-sense heritability was estimated for plant height, stigma position, pollen viability, and fruit weight. Low heritability estimates were found for the number of flowers, fruit set, and yield. Despite the interaction, traits recorded under control and heat conditions were positively correlated. Multivariate analysis located the genotypes in a topography that was stable under all conditions, except under the harshest temperatures.

Larvae exposed to constant low salinity were significantly smaller but developed all larval arms at a slower rate than larvae in all other treatments. Larvae exposed to fluctuating salinity recovered and developed significantly longer larval arms and bigger rudiments than larvae kept at constant low salinity. Larvae exposed to fluctuating salinity produced more juveniles than larvae at constant high salinity (32 parts per thousand), while those at constant low salinity produced few or no juveniles. Four-arm larvae exposed to fluctuating salinity produced significantly more juveniles than six-arm larvae exposed to the same treatment. Transferring competent 8-arm larvae from 3 1 parts per thousand to 15 parts per thousand for 2 days then back to 3 1 parts per thousand, induced metamorphosis with juvenile production being significantly higher than for those kept at a constant salinity of 20, 25 and 3 1 parts per thousand.

To investigate the extent to which germination and emergence traits have differentiated in two natural populations of common lambsquarters from different environments (Denmark as mesic and Iran as xeric population), experiments were conducted in the laboratory. Germination of both populations was stimulated by light. The greatest germination percentage of xeric and mesic populations occurred at 25/15 and 20/10 C, respectively. The xeric population showed significantly greater germinability at the lowest (15/5 C) and the highest (35/25 C) fluctuating temperature regimes. Germination of the xeric population was only slightly affected, and the mesic population was severely retarded at a salinity level of 20 desi siemens (DS) m(-1). Greater than 42% of the xeric seeds germinated at 30 dS m(-1) salinity, while the mesic germination almost ceased at this salinity level. Germination of seeds placed in distilled water after the 14-d salinity exposure treatments (recovery rates) was also greater for the xeric vs. mesic populations. Xeric populations showed more than 65% germination up to the osmotic potential of -0.4 MPa, while decreasing osmotic potential from 0 to -0.4 MPa caused an 80% reduction in mesic population germinability (9% germination). The greatest emergence of xeric (77%) and mesic (70%) populations occurred for seeds placed on the soil surface and no seedlings emerged from burial depth 3 cm. These study results suggest that common lambsquarters populations have differentiated for heat, salinity, and drought tolerance at germination stage. These contrasting germination patterns are appeared to be due to either adaptation via natural selection or maternal effects, or some combination of both. Though this study has certain limitations, it, through its findings and their propositions, adds to the existing knowledge about interpopulation differences in germination requirements of common lambsquarters, as a globally distributed species.",,,,,"Eslami, S.

We released two groups of 40,000 juveniles of ca. 50 mm size, one group in the early (29 May) and the other in late (2 July) seasons, periods with predicted high and low densities of prey mysids, respectively, although the abundance of mysids fluctuated markedly during the season. Food availability was higher for the early release group than the late release group. Although the main stomach contents of released and wild juveniles were mainly mysids and fish, the feeding state differed between the early and late release groups. The early release group had a stomach content index (SI) similar to that of the wild juveniles, but the SI of the late group was significantly less than that of the early release group and wild juveniles. The percentage of fish with empty stomachs was much higher in the late release group than in the other two groups. In addition, the density decrease rate was significantly more rapid for the late release group than the early release group. Clear correspondence between the food availability and feeding state of the released flounder juveniles indicates that the release of juveniles in an appropriate season when mysids are abundant is crucial for successful stocking.

The reuse of materials from waste (i.e., recycling) rarely occurs in social insects because it may imply significant health risks and behavioral difficulties. However, the benefit of reusing may exceed its costs under certain circumstances. For the first time, we document that ants recycle refuse materials to repair nest-mound damage. We conducted a series of field measurements and experiments to test the hypotheses that fluctuations in this behavior in the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex lobicornis depend on 1) seasonal changes in the tendency to reject refuse (a proxy of changes in their pathogen levels), and/or 2) seasonal foraging restrictions. We 1) measured the rejection of foraging ants toward experimental refuse piles among seasons and 2) analyzed how mound condition, temperatures of fungus chamber and soil surface, and foraging activity explained this behavior using a classification tree, a powerful recursive partitioning method. Foraging ants showed similar rejection levels toward refuse piles in different seasons. Colonies repaired mound damage with refuse materials only during the hottest season and when they had low foraging rates, suggesting that ants recycle their refuse by a hierarchical set of decisions dependent on the risk of fungal damage and foraging restrictions. Repairing the mounds is essential during summer, when temperatures inside damaged mounds are lethal to their fungus cultures. However, these high temperatures also restrict the foraging activity, reducing the collection of building materials. Thus, colonies with lower foraging rates apparently use their refuse to repair mounds because this substrate requires less searching and carrying time. The use of refuse did not affect the colony growth rate. This illustrates how ants integrate information about food, hygienic and nest conditions through a novel and plastic behavior: recycling of their discarded materials.",,,,,"Farji-Brener, Alejandro Gustavo/I-8372-2019","Farji-Brener, Alejandro Gustavo/0000-0001-7251-3866",,,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,1465-7279,,,,NOV-DEC,2012,23,6,,,,,1195,1202,,10.1093/beheco/ars101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/ars101,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000310153500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is especially true of early flowering, frost-sensitive stone fruit species. In the past 15 years, detailed examinations have been made on floral bud development, its effect on frost tolerance and on the relationship with environmental factors in various genotypes of three species, almond, apricot and peach, sampled from an experimental orchard located in the centre of Hungary, 30 km from Budapest. In addition to field tests a range of laboratory experiments were used to measure frost tolerance. Based on these data, models have been elaborated for phenological processes and for changes in the frost tolerance of floral buds in varieties of each fruit species representing different frost tolerance levels. Of the three fruit species, apricot genotypes, especially those with low demand for chilling units, are the most sensitive to temperature fluctuations, resulting in the largest seasonal effects on the floral bud development rate. Temperature influences the development rate of almond and peach to a smaller extent, though there are, nevertheless, large variations among the genotypes of these fruit species. Not only the floral bud development rate, but also the frost tolerance of overwintering organs, is strongly influenced by temperature changes during dormancy. No correlation has been found between these two plant characteristics, confirming their separate genetic determination. The models elaborated may promote (1) the evaluation of breeding materials and the selection of varieties suited to the Carpathian Basin and to areas with similar climatic conditions, and (2) the planning of technological measures necessary for increasing yield safety, improving the profitability of cultivating frost-sensitive stone fruit species as a potential outcome.

Sclerotia viability declined more rapidly in soil maintained at 25 degrees C or at soil temperatures fluctuating from 18 to 32 degrees C under greenhouse conditions, compared with sclerotia viability in soil kept at 30 degrees C.

A significant increase in plant mortality was observed in infested soils maintained at 30 versus 25 degrees C, whereas water stress at 25 or 30 degrees C did not affect plant mortality in M. phaseolina-infested soils. This demonstrated the importance of elevated soil temperature, not moisture stress, on plant mortality caused by M. phaseolina. Host specificity was not evident when strawberry plants were inoculated with each of seven Israeli isolates of M. phaseolina obtained from six other plant species, suggesting the importance of keeping strawberry crops out of rotation with other host crops of the pathogen.

The studies were conducted for 36 months, every 30 days, by SCUBA diving. Over the three years the seasonal changes in water pH, conductivity, HCO(3)(-) concentration, sediment hydration and pH were not statistically significant (P>0.05), and light intensity was higher in winter than in summer. Over the three years 4 consecutive stages of population development were observed: regeneration, stabilisation of abundance (fluctuations), regression and repeated regeneration. These stages appeared and lasted at different temperatures and light intensity. The greatest monthly increase in abundance took place in summer and lasted until the beginning of autumn under conditions of high temperature and relatively low light intensity. Long-term abundance variations were strongly correlated with the appearance of filamentous algae, less strongly with the dynamics of the dominant species (Sphagnum denticulatum), and the least with water temperature, light intensity, water and sediment pH, conductivity and HCO(3)(-) concentration. As a result of a massive bloom of these algae, light intensity decreased in the water, Warnstorfia shed its leaves, and then the entire population disappeared. In winter that year it began to regenerate from vegetative propagules (leafless shoots), which were the remains of individuals growing before the filamentous algae appeared. In softwater lakes such massive algal blooms are a common phenomenon which limits light transmission to the substrate and as a result leads to changes in the submerged vegetation structure, especially that of bryophytes.",,,,,,"Merdalski, Marek/0000-0003-2117-4889; Szmeja, Jozef/0000-0002-1834-9468",,,,,,,,,,,,,1505-2249,,,,,,2010,58,2,,,,,221,230,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000278934700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Both species, besides serving many purposes, have an important advantage in that they can be easily propagated vegetatively. However, little is known about their propagation by seed. Several experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of light, temperature and scarification on the germination of the seeds. The seeds of both species exhibited dormancy, although to different degrees, caused by impermeable hard seed coats. In E. brucei, the highest germination percentage (90%) was obtained from seeds placed under direct light from fluorescent tubes coupled with fluctuating day (20-degrees-C) and night (10-12-degrees-C) temperatures as well as from seeds treated with boiling water for 5 s. Similarly, in E. burana, the highest germination percentage (85%) was obtained in seeds placed at a constant temperature of 25-degrees-C in a thermogradient as well as in seeds treated with concentrated sulphuric acid for 1 h . Therefore, for a higher rate and percentage of germination, it is recommended that the seeds of E. brucei be immersed in boiling water for 5 s. However, since the dormancy of seeds of E. brucei is relatively low, untreated seeds may also be used to obtain a reasonable cumulative germination percentage (about 80%). In the case of E. burana, although a higher percentage and rate of germination can be obtained using sulphuric acid, it is recommended that untreated seeds should be used at a higher sowing density to compensate for the dormancy until a cheap, safe, convenient and rapid method of germination is found. The further investigation of growth characteristics, reproductive biology/ecology as well as performance in agroforestry of both species is recommended.",,,,,"Teketay, Demel/AAG-4814-2021",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1127,,,,,JUN,1994,65,2-3,,,,,81,87,,10.1016/0378-1127(94)90160-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1127(94)90160-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NX63500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study adapts the mesoscale Hydrological Model (mHM) which is applied separately in the Upper Lake Malawi and Shire River basins. A particular Lake Malawi model, which focuses on reservoir routing and lake water balance, has been developed and is interlinked between the two basins. Climate change projections from 20 Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) models for Africa based on two scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100 are used. An annual temperature increase of 1 degrees C decreases mean lake level and outflow by 0.3 m and 17%, respectively, signifying the importance of intensified evaporation for Lake Malawi's water budget. Meanwhile, a +5% (-5%) deviation in annual rainfall changes mean lake level by +0.7 m (-0.6 m). The combined effects of temperature increase and rainfall decrease result in significantly lower flows in the Shire River. The hydrological river regime may change from perennial to seasonal with the combination of annual temperature increase and precipitation decrease beyond 1.5 degrees C (3.5 degrees C) and -20% (-15%). The study further projects a reduction in annual hydropower production between 1% (RCP8.5) and 2.5% (RCP4.5) during 2021-2050 and between 5% (RCP4.5) and 24% (RCP8.5) during 2071-2100.

The results shows that the greatest impact on the winter wheat yield is the precipitation overwintering period in this area, each 1 mm increase in daily mean rainfall was associated with 201.64 kg/hm2 lowered output. Moreover, the temperature and sunshine duration in heading period and maturity stage also exert significant influence on the output, every 1 degrees C increase in daily mean temperature was associated with 199.85kg/hm2 adding output, every 1 h increase in mean sunshine duration was associated with 130.68kg/hm2 reduced output.

In this study, we want to investigate the flow physics of wall-bounded stratified turbulence at relatively high shear Reynolds number Re tau and for mild to moderate stratification level - quantified here by the shear Richardson number varying in the range 0 <= Ri(tau) <= 300. By increasing stratification, active turbulence is sustained only in the near-wall region, whereas intermittent turbulence, modulated by the presence of non-turbulent wavy structures (internal gravity waves), is observed at the channel core. In such conditions, the wall-normal transport of momentum and heat is considerably reduced compared with the case of non-stratified turbulence. A careful characterization of the flow-field statistics shows that, despite temperature and wall-normal velocity fluctuations being very large at the channel centre, the mean value of their product - the buoyancy flux - vanishes for Ri(tau) >= 200. We show that this behaviour is due to the presence of a similar to pi/2 phase delay between the temperature and the wall-normal velocity signals: when wall-normal velocity fluctuations are large (in magnitude), temperature fluctuations are almost zero, and vice versa. This constitutes a blockage effect to the wall-normal exchange of energy. In addition, we show that the friction factor scales as Cf similar to Ri(tau)(-1/3), and we propose a new scaling for the Nusselt number, Nu.Re-tau(-2/3 )similar to Ri(tau)(-1/3). These scaling laws, which seem to be robust over the explored range of parameters, complement and extend previous experimental and numerical data, and are expected to help the development of improved models and parametrizations of stratified flows at large Re-tau.",,,,,"Zonta, Francesco/GWZ-9068-2022","Hadi Sichani, Pejman/0000-0003-1440-3479; Zonta, Francesco/0000-0002-3849-315X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1120,1469-7645,,,,JUL 12,2022,945,,,,,,,,A3,10.1017/jfm.2022.514,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2022.514,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000823124900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

By using a mathematical approach for the analysis of plant traits and environmental variables, this study aimed at highlighting a methodological framework to analytically unravel the environmental control of stem cycles. A derivative analysis was performed on data derived from experimental measurements, which showed a high degree of agreement between environmental drivers and dendrometer signals. The analytical approach provided information on plant performance in response to environmental variation, removing the confounding effects of different variables.

We hypothesised that, due to the high heterogeneity of aquatic environments, none of the environmental factors, such as light, temperature fluctuations or oxygen would play the role of a reliable trigger for seed germination of these species. The results of the germination experiments confirm the proposed hypothesis: under almost all conditions - fluctuating and constant temperatures, light and darkness, aerobic, flooded and hypoxia conditions - germination percentages ranged from 88.5 to 100%.

Microorganisms play a dominant role in global biogeochemical cycles crucial for a planet's sustainability. Since microbial communities are highly dependent on the temperature factor, fluctuations in the same will lead to adverse effects on the microbial community organization. Throughout the Ocean, increase in evaporation rates causes the surface mixed layer to become shallower. This intensified stratification inhibits vertical transport of nutrient supplies. Such density driven processes will decrease oxygen solubility in surface waters leading to significant decrease of oxygen from future Ocean. Metabolism and diversity of microbes along with ocean biogeochemistry will be at great risk due to global warming and its related effects. As a response to the changes in temperature, alteration in the distribution of phytoplankta communities is observed all over the planet, creating changes in the primary production of the ocean causing massive impact on the biosphere. Marine microbial communities try to adapt to the changing ocean environmental conditions by responding with biogeographic range shifts, community structure modifications, and adaptive evolution. Persistence of this climate change on ocean ecosystems, in future, will pose serious threat to the metabolism and distribution of marine microbes leading to fluctuations in the biogeochemical cycles thereby affecting the overall ecosystem functioning. Genomics plays an important role in marine microbial research by providing tools to study the association between environment and organisms. The ecological and genomic perspectives of marine microbes are being investigated to design effective models to understand their physiology and evolution in a changing ocean. Mesocosm/ microcosm experimental studies and field studies are in the need of the hour to evaluate the impact of climate shifts on microbial genesis.

Springtail and mite species composition and abundance were monitored at intervals throughout the experiment. Furthermore, nutrient content and mobilisation in the soil and soil microbial biomass and nutrient content were examined. There was no conclusive evidence that recurring freeze-thaw events had a negative effect on the investigated soil faunal groups, and the treatment even seemed to stimulate the abundance of Acaridida. Respiration of soil subjected to 16 freeze-thaw cycles was low when kept at -2 degreesC and high when kept at +2 degreesC, indicating rapid response of microbial activity even after long exposure to low and fluctuating temperatures. Oribatida and Gamasida displayed a higher abundance in controls kept at -2 degreesC for up to 80 days, compared to controls at +2 degreesC and the freeze-thaw treatment. The Collembola were unaffected by the temperature treatments, but increased in abundance over time. The microbial C:N ratio increased after 40 days at -2 degreesC. indicating a higher degree of fungal dominance and lower tolerance of bacteria to constant freezing, but not to freeze-thaw. decline in inorganic and microbial P during the experiment, and the proportionally stronger decrease of inorganic and microbial P than N in frozen soil compared to +2 degreesC soil, suggests that P is affected more than N mineralisation by freezing.

The study area has a fairly complex surface. The vegetation cover is heterogeneous and sparse, and the terrain is mildly hilly, but dissected by ephemeral channels. Besides measurement of some of the standard weather data such as wind speed, air temperature, and solar radiation, these sites also contained instruments for estimating the local surface energy balance. The approach utilized measurements of net radiation (R(n)), soil heat flux (G) and Monin-Obukhov similarity theory applied to first- and second-order turbulent statistics of wind speed and temperature for determining the sensible heat flux (H). The latent heat flux (LE) was solved as a residual in the surface energy balance equation, namely, LE = -(R(n) + G + H). This procedure (VAR-RESID) for estimating the energy fluxes satisfied monetary constraints and the requirement for low maintenance and continued operation through the harsh environmental conditions experienced in semiarid regions. Comparison of energy fluxes using this approach with more traditional eddy correlation techniques showed differences were within 20% under unstable conditions. Similar variability in flux estimates over the study area was present in the eddy correlation data. Hence, estimates of H and LE using the VAR-RESID approach under unstable conditions were considered satisfactory. Also, with second-order statistics of vertical velocity collected at several sites, the local momentum roughness length was estimated.

An elevational transect spanning 3.66 km from 1 700 to 3 000 m a.s.l. was established at the summit Malaya Khatipara situated within the Teberda State Biosphere reserve. Between 2010 and 2013 1177 fructifications of nivicolous myxomycetes were recorded, with 700 of these determined to 44 species, varieties, and forms. Virtually all fructifications developed near or at the margin of a snow field. Abundance of myxomycete fructifications varied extremely between years, ranging from near zero to hundreds of colonies. At sites with known myxomycete occurrences 16 data loggers were installed in the years 2011 and 2012, measuring relative humidity and temperature at the soil surface. Together with weather data recorded on the nearby Klukhor pass and experiments with myxamoebae cultured on agar, these data explain the observed extreme fluctuations in myxomycete abundance. A sudden frost (one night below 10 degrees C) occurring before the first lasting snow in Nov. 2011 was most likely the reason for the nearly complete absence of myxomycete fruiting in spring 2012. Culture experiments showed that amoebae survived a slow decrease in temperature, as occurs under a sheltering snow cover, but are killed by sudden freezing. Extreme temperature changes recorded at the margin of snow fields explain why nivicolous myxomycetes must fruit before snow melt is complete, and the different transmittance of snow packs for light of different wave lengths may be crucial for triggering the formation of fruiting bodies. The high abundance of fructifications in nivicolous myxomycetes suggests them to be important predators of microbial communities under snow. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

This flux depends on the soil organisms and the plants roots and is based on soil temperature, soil moisture and texture. The aim of the present study was to design a method to quantify CO2 emissions and to validate it using a regression model that helps develop an improved experimental model for the use of a flux measurement chamber. Soil emissions were measured in an area covered with Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (Bermuda) with a closed LICOR LI-8100A dynamic chamber equipped with an infrared gas analyzer. Soil temperature and moisture were also determined using built-in sensors, in four different daytime intervals between sample collections. The intervals were studied to find the best estimation of CO2 emissions, under different environmental conditions and two observation times: the first one lasted 240 s every 5 min, for 8 h; the second one lasted 90 s with two repetitions every 30, 60 and 120 min for 12 h. The main results showed that there were significant differences in samples evaluated at 8:00 and 18:00; at other times, soil respiration was relatively homogenous. The ideal measurement interval that describes the spatial fluctuation of CO2 throughout the day and between different periods of solar radiation was 120 min. The validation of the linear regression model determined 50% of the variation, and the rest could be explained with other variables such as grass development and soil physiochemical properties.

We set up a factorial field experiment with two levels each of the factors litter cover (0 and 400 g m(-2)), gap size (0.01 and 0.1 m(2)) and propagule pressure (5 and 50 seeds) and documented soil temperature, soil water content and relative light availability. Recruitment was recorded in spring and autumn 2010 and in spring 2011 to cover initial seedling emergence, establishment after summer drought and final establishment after the first winter. Litter alleviated temperature and moisture conditions and had positive effects on proportional and absolute seedling emergence during all phases of recruitment. Large gaps presented competition-free space with high light availability but showed higher temperature amplitudes and lower soil moisture. Proportional and absolute seedling recruitment was significantly higher in large than in small gaps. In contrast, propagule pressure facilitated absolute seedling emergence but had no effects on proportional emergence or the chance for successful colonisation. Despite significantly higher initial seedling emergence of resident than non-resident species, seed mass and other species-specific traits may be better predictors for idiosyncratic variation in seedling establishment than status. Our data support the fluctuating resource hypothesis and demonstrate that the reserve effect of seeds may facilitate seedling emergence. The direct comparison of propagule pressure with other environmental factors showed that propagule pressure affects absolute seedling abundance, which may be crucial for species that depend on other individuals for sexual reproduction. However, propagule batch size did not significantly affect the chance for successful colonisation of disturbed plots.",,,,,"Eckstein, Lutz/A-9241-2012; Donath, Tobias W/B-2856-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUL 24,2012,7,7,,,,,,,e41887,10.1371/journal.pone.0041887,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0041887,,,,,,,,22911863,,,,,WOS:000306751300080,View Full Record in Web of Science

The area of reproduction of this species is very wide in the Adriatic since the anchovy will spawn anywhere down to the depth of 200 m. However the main spawning area is in the eutrophic waters of the western part of the shallow northern Adriatic and along the Italian coast to the peninsula of Gargano. Anchovy spawn in the Adriatic generally from April to October, in the temperature and salinity ranges of 11.6 - 27.6 degrees C and 9.1 - 39.6 ppt, respectively. Developmental times of Adriatic anchovy eggs and larvae, as well as the growth curves of larvae and postlarvae, were estimated ender experimental conditions. The growth curves of postlarvae were also estimated from otolith readings. Biomass assessments of Adriatic anchovy by means of egg production method was made possible by the known temperature-development relationships, as well as the knowledge of the residence times of particular developmental stages. Spawning biomass was estimated in the northern and middle Adriatic during the period from 1976 to 1990. Detailed investigations of long-term fluctuations of anchovy egg production, quantity of larvae and postlarvae, as well as of instantaneous mortality rates of postlarvae, were performed in the middle Adriatic for the period from 1962 to 1976. Fluctuations of egg production and larval abundance were found positively correlated with fluctuations of temperature, salinity, primary production and zooplankton quantity, with a lag of one year. As eutrophication particularly affected the shallow northern Adriatic and the zone along the Italian coast as far as the peninsula of Gargano, it seems that this phenomenon negatively affected the reproduction of the anchovy in its main spawning areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0214-8358,1886-8134,,,,DEC,1996,60,,,2,,,167,177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996WL54500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

It describes and discusses environmental measurements taken in three successional stages (stage III, an open willow stand; stage V, a closed balsam poplar - alder stand; and stage VIII, a mature white spruce stand) and compares these measurements with those taken in adjacent artificial clearings. The impact of vegetation-mediated changes on soil temperatures, ground surface evaporation, and precipitation regimes is substantial, but the magnitude of these changes declines with advancing succession. Removing vegetation in the three successional stages resulted in warming of the mineral soil and increased surface evaporation, even though there were only slight changes in air temperature. Vertical soil moisture movement occurs along a tension gradient from the water table for distances of up to 50 cm in the mineral soil and can be correlated with fluctuations in the river level.

However, this has been only based on a limited number of, mainly, non-replicated observations. In this study, we tested whether the nematode community succession patterns are recurrent for parallel processes and assessed the relationship between the changes in the nematode community and potential important variables (i.e., temperature, duration of composting and the microbial community). The nematode and microbial community of three simultaneously running Controlled Farm Composting and a reference Green Waste composting process were analyzed through time. Bacterial-feeding enrichment opportunists were most numerous during and directly after the heat peaks. Subsequently, the bacterial-feeding/predator community dominated and the fungal-feeding nematodes became more dominant during maturation, confirming general community patterns from previous experiments. Nematode abundances significantly fluctuated with temperature and the relative abundance of fungal-feeding nematodes increased as the duration of the curing process increased. The amount of fungal-feeding nematodes was associated significantly with both duration of composting and temperature, and the F/(F + B) ratio was only significantly associated with duration of composting. Based on these results, and additional data from an industrial reference compost process and on available literature, a Nematode-based Index of Compost Maturity (NICM) is proposed, combining four nematode-based criteria (i.e., nematode abundance, F/(F + B) ratio, the presence of more than one fungal-feeding taxon and the presence of diplogasterids). Nevertheless, the NICM should be considered as work in progress which should be tested for a wider range of composts from diverse feedstock mixtures, locations (sites) and composting techniques, to validate the use of the index and allow more reliable interpretation of particular values of this index.",,,,,"Neher, Deborah/H-2716-2019; Hendrickx, Frederik/F-3149-2013; Moens, Tom/AAB-8701-2019; Bert, Wim/D-4511-2013; Vandecasteele, Bart/X-7165-2019","Neher, Deborah/0000-0002-9647-8783; Bert, Wim/0000-0002-5864-412X; Vandecasteele, Bart/0000-0002-3079-859X; Moens, Tom/0000-0001-6544-9210",,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,FEB,2018,85,,,,,,409,421,,10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.10.039,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.10.039,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000430634500042,View Full Record in Web of Science

Analysis of ruffling activity on the macrophages before and during phagocytosis of the parasites indicated that increased ruffling response near forming phagosomes, most likely induced by the parasite, accelerates phagocytosis.

In the Sierra Nevada of California, Didymosphenia and other taxa that produce mucopolysaccharide stalks (e.g., Gomphoneis, Cymbella) can dominate benthic environments, particularly in the altered hydrologic and thermal regimes downstream of dams. We compared the prevalence of stalked diatoms in paired reaches, one free-flowing and the other regulated, within two Sierran river systems, the American and Feather Rivers. In the regulated reaches, short-term power generation caused daily flow fluctuations and periphyton biovolume was dominated by either Didymosphenia (where hypolimnetic releases created cool summer temperatures) or other stalked diatom taxa (where temperatures were warm). Periphyton assemblages from the unregulated sites were significantly different from the regulated reaches based on biovolume, with Gomphonema being the genus at unregulated sites contributing to the dissimilarities after accounting for the stalked genera from the regulated reaches. We evaluated the consequences of mucopolysaccharides for a large-bodied grazer, tadpoles of the foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii), in a factorial experiment manipulating diet and thermal regime. At 16.6 degrees C mean daily temperature, tadpoles lost weight (72h relative change of-16.1 +/- 7.2%) when grazing on periphyton from a Didymosphenia-dominated site. At 19.9 degrees C (similar to unregulated river conditions), tadpoles grazed Didymosphenia at a rate similar to tadpoles consuming higher protein control periphyton, but the former tadpoles did not grow (relative change of 4.3 +/- 5.4% vs 30.7 +/- 3.4% for control periphyton). When tadpoles were fed periphyton dominated by mucilaginous stalked diatoms other than Didymosphenia, tadpole weight loss was 21.0 +/- 9.2% (cool) and 16.6 +/- 5.6% (warm).

In grasslands, current understanding of liming impacts on greenhouse gas emissions is limited by a lack of field data on liming and soil respiration. Here we used a two-year field trial and in situ chamber measurements to evaluate the effects of repeated, low-level liming on soil CO2 emissions from an acidic managed grassland with high soil organic matter content. Soil pH, temperature and moisture were measured during the experiment, as well as microbial and plant biomass, in order to assess possible liming-induced changes to drivers of grassland carbon cycling. Soil CO2 emissions showed significant variation during the two-year study, driven primarily by fluctuations in soil temperature. Soil respiration rates were unaffected by liming treatment, despite significant lime-induced increases in soil pH. Liming was associated with a decrease in biomass produced per gram nitrogen, as well as a decrease in forage C:N in the second year and transient decreases in microbial C:N, but neither plant nor microbial biomass showed significant responses to liming addition.

Typical buildings are static structures, unable to adjust to dynamic temperature and daylight fluctuations. Adaptive facades that are responsive to these unsteady solar conditions can substantially reduce operational energy inefficiencies, indoor heating, cooling, and lighting costs, as well as greenhouse-gas emissions. Inspired by marine organisms that disperse pigments within their skin, we propose an adaptive building interface that uses reversible fluid injections to tune optical transmission. Pigmented fluids with tunable morphologies are reversibly injected and withdrawn from confined layers, achieving locally-adjustable shading and interior solar exposure. Multicell arrays tiled across large areas enable differential and dynamic building responses, demonstrated using both experimental and simulated approaches.

Germination of all the three species was stimulated by light and warm fluctuating temperatures. Germination of C. difformis was influenced to a greater degree by increasing salt and water stress than C. iria and F. miliacea. In all three species, seeds sown on the soil surface gave the greatest percentage of seedling emergence, and no seedlings emerged from seeds buried in soil at depths of >= 1 cm. Flooding, although not continuous or deep, had a suppressive effect on emergence and growth of C. iria and F. miliacea. Intermittent flooding to shallow depths, however, was less effective in controlling C. difformis; deep flooding was needed to suppress growth of C. difformis seedlings.

The numerical studies based on a finite-difference method (FDM) are direct Navier-Stokes simulations without any turbulence model (DNS). Under the Boussinesq approximation, the governing equations consist of the Navier-Stokes, continuity and energy equations for 3D incompressible stratified flows. Stable stratification rapidly suppresses the fluctuations of streamwise velocity and temperature as well as the vertical velocity fluctuation. Momentum and heat fluxes are also significantly decreased with increasing stability and become nearly zero over the whole boundary depth of the boundary layer with very strong stability.

In view of the rapid evaporation rate and serious loss of soil water in tropical areas, this paper explored the effect of organic mulch materials with different thickness on the increase of soil water retention rate and the improvement of soil water loss caused by evaporation. Rubberwood sawdust (RWS), rubberwood bark (RWB), coconut fiber (CF), and Mulch (MC) were selected as the mulching materials. Field experiment and laboratory experiment were performed, and soil-moisture content and temperature were continuously monitored. However, from the daily measurement of water content at constant conditions (29 degrees C +/- 0.2 degrees C, 74% +/- 1% air RH) in the laboratory experiment, the results of variance analysis (ANOVA) showed that there was no significant difference between the soil-water content of covered samples and bare soil (P 0.05). In the field experiments, the analysis of variance indicated significant differences in the soil-moisture content owing to the effect of the covering material (P < 0.01). Mulching increased the soil-moisture content with smaller fluctuations in the deep soil compared with bare soil. The most stable soil-moisture content were achieved by RWS, RWB, CF, and MC, with thicknesses of 5, 3, 7, and 5 cm, respectively, compared with bare soil, and the average water contents of the 0-40 cm soil layer was 0.58%, 0.01%, 0.82%, and 0.93%, respectively. Vertically, the intensity of the change in soil moisture decreased gradually with increasing depth, and was more stable than that of bare soil and other treatments. Among them, the difference in water content between the adjacent gradient soil layers (the soil layers are graded every 10 cm in depth) M3-7 (0.011 +/- 0.004) was the smallest.

It was found that the ICB does not perform similarly in all seasons, and/or in all orientations. The results show that ICB will perform best in Autumn with an average DF of 0.23, and with an average TDR of 0.56. The biggest value in terms of the Tg is found in Spring with 14.85h.

Here, we combined year-long reciprocal transplantation experiments along natural oceanographic gradients with an in situ assessment of CWC fitness.

We carried out a long-term transplant experiment with live nubbins and skeleton slabs of the dominating coral Porites lutea to assess the net growth and bioerosion in LAIW-exposed and LAIW-protected waters. Depth-related, seasonal and interannual differences in LAIW-intensities on the exposed western sides of the islands allowed us to separate the effect of LAIW from other possible factors (e.g. monsoon) affecting the corals. Coral growth and bioerosion were inversely related to LAIW intensity, and positively related to coral framework development. Accretion rates of calcareous fouling organisms on the slabs were negligible compared to bioerosion, reflecting the lack of a true carbonate framework on the exposed W faces of the Similan Islands.

We incubated eggs under five thermal regimes (22, 25, 28, 25 +/- 3 and 27 +/- 5 degrees C) to examine the effects of constant versus fluctuating temperatures on incubation length and hatchling morphology. In our sample the largest male and female were 110 mm and 108 mm snout-vent length (SVL), respectively. Adult males and females did not differ in mean SVL; adult males were larger in head size (both length and width), longer in fore and hind-limb lengths and shorter in abdomen length than females of the same SVL. Accordingly, we conclude that S. incognitus is a sexually monomorphic species in terms of SVL but shows sexual dimorphism in head size, abdomen length and appendage length. Females laid a single clutch of 3-10 eggs per breeding season from early May to mid-August, with larger females generally laying more (but not always larger) eggs per clutch than did smaller ones. Embryonic stages at laying ranged from Dufaure and Hubert's (1961) stage 31 to 32, with a mean stage of 31.3. The positive relationship between clutch mass and female SVL was not significant. The offspring size-number trade-off does not exist in S. incognitus, as revealed by the fact that egg mass was independent of relative fecundity. Incubation length decreased as temperature increased, and stable temperatures resulted in delayed hatching. Hatchlings incubated under the five thermal regimes did not differ from each other in any examined trait, suggesting that S. incognitus is among oviparous reptilian species where incubation temperature has no role in modifying hatchling morphology as long as eggs are not exposed to extreme temperatures for prolonged periods of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2095-0357,,,,,,2018,9,2,,,,,119,128,,10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180011,http://dx.doi.org/10.16373/j.cnki.ahr.180011,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000440282600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

A suite of Atlantic Pacemaker experiments performs well in reproducing the observed MSIO SST multidecadal variation and its association with the South Atlantic. This transbasin covariability can be described by an atmospheric bridge mechanism, in which South Atlantic multidecadal variability-related SST warming weakens regional meridional circulation over the South Atlantic, suppressing convection over tropical Africa. The reduced diabatic heating then drives a cold atmospheric Kelvin wave that penetrates into the tropical Indian Ocean, leading to an anomalous cyclonic circulation there that weakens the westerlies over the MSIO and subsequently triggers the warming of MSIO.

This hypothesis was tested by measuring diurnal variations in leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf water potential, and the responses of CO2 assimilation to increasing air CO2 concentrations in 1-year-old 'Valencia' sweet orange scions grafted onto 'Cleopatra' mandarin rootstocks during the winter and summer seasons in a subtropical climate. In addition, diurnal leaf gas exchange was evaluated under controlled conditions, with constant environmental conditions during both winter and summer. In relation to our hypothesis, a greater rate of photosynthesis is found during the summer compared to the winter. Reduced photosynthesis during winter was induced by cool night conditions, as the diurnal fluctuation of environmental conditions was not limiting. Low air and soil temperatures caused decreases in the stomatal conductance and in the rates of the biochemical reactions underlying photosynthesis (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation and RuBP regeneration) during the winter compared to the values obtained for those markers in the Summer. Citrus photosynthesis during the summer was riot impaired by biochemical or photochemical reactions. as CO2 assimilation was only limited by stomatal conductance due to high leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference (VPD) during the afternoon.

In this study, we applied the AgroC model to assess climate change impact on changes in growing environmental conditions, growing season length, yield and potential yield losses due to multiple abiotic stresses. The model was calibrated and validated using data from dedicated field experiments conducted in Lithuania during four meteorologically contrasting years (2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019). We simulated the climate impacts on rainfed maize for long-term future climate conditions from 2020 to 2100 under the RCP2.6 (low), RCP4.5 (medium) and RCP8.5 (high) emission scenarios. As a result, we found that air temperature, sum of growing degree days and amount of precipitation during the growing season of maize will increase, especially under medium and higher emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), with significantly positive effect on yields. The simulation results showed that average maize grain yield will increase under RCP2.6 by 69 kg ha per decade, under RCP4.5 by 197 kg ha(-1) per decade and under RCP8.5 by 304 kg ha per decade. The future potential maize yield reveals a progressive increase with a surplus of +10.2% under RCP4.5 and +14.4% under RCP8.5, while under RCP2.6 the increase of potential yield during the same period will be statistically not significant. The yield gap under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 will fluctuate within a rather narrow range and under RCP8.5, it will decrease. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Overall mortality of tagged and untagged cod held in submersible enclosures was low, with 11.8% of 719 tagged and 10.3% of 146 untagged cod dead or in poor condition after retention periods of 5-10 days; only two fish lost a tag. The effects of length at capture (range 45-97 cm), gear type (hand-line, otter-trawl, cod trap), and season (spring and summer/fall) on survival of tagged cod was also examined using a generalized linear model. Only season was found to be a significant (P < 0.0001) factor. Mortality of tagged cod was highest in summer and fall (22%, range 21-25%) when water temperatures were warmer (5.6-7.9degreesC) or showed wide fluctuations, and mortality was lowest in spring (3%, range 0-10%) when water temperatures were consistently cold (-1.0 to 3.0 degreesC). Overall survival of three batches of cod (n = 200) caught by otter-trawl at depths of 110-179 m, tagged, and held in tanks of ambient seawater (1.0-2.0degreesC) on a research vessel for 5 days was 91.5%. Relative survival of tagged cod caught with otter-trawl, cod trap, or line-trawls compared to tagged cod caught with hand-lines was also examined and found to be not significantly different, at least at depths <100 m. In many of our field studies, typically from 25 to 45.5% of the initial number of tagged cod have been recaptured to date; thus at least that percentage of tagged individuals must have survived. These percentages increase to between 45 and 95% when natural mortality, tag loss, and reporting rates are also taken into account. Overall, the results indicate high survival of tagged adult cod, particularly when water temperatures are consistently cold and capture depths are <180 m; survival of adult cod caught for tagging in deeper water (>200 m) requires further investigation.

Turbulent airflows induce spatially-complex and highly intermittent boundary conditions that affect surface evaporation rates and associated near-surface thermal regimes. Such interactions are particularly significant during stage-I evaporation (vaporization plane at the surface) where turbulent eddies induce highly localized and intermittent variations in evaporative fluxes that leave distinct thermal signatures observable by infrared thermography (IRT). A theoretical framework supported by an experimental method was proposed to capitalize on measured thermal fluctuations of evaporating porous surfaces to determine airflow turbulence characteristics and evaporative fluxes. The study focuses on thin surfaces with low thermal capacity to illustrate experimentally direct links between characteristics of surface thermal fluctuations and momentum-based turbulent eddy residence times. For most practical applications, the method could be applied using rapid IR measurements from a single sensor aimed at the surface. The theoretical links between surface wetness and characteristics of surface temperature fluctuations offer opportunities for remote quantification of drying and energy exchange processes from engineered and natural porous surfaces.

To improve yield stability, it is critical to utilise a model that can simulate mungbean phenology, biomass, and yield accurately. Methods. A thorough understanding of the physiological determinants of growth and yield is required to advance existing mungbean crop modelling capability. Currently, there is limited understanding of the physiological determinants of canopy and reproductive development and their variation in mungbean germplasm. Two experiments (controlled and field environments) were conducted at Gatton, Queensland, in 2018-19. Six Australian mungbean genotypes and one black gram (Vigna mungo L.) were grown under non-limiting conditions. Plant phenotypic traits (canopy development, time to first, 50% flowering, duration of flowering and podding, flower appearance, pod addition rates) were recorded. key results. Genotypes M10403 and Satin 11 had significantly higher leaf appearance rate (LAR). Genotypes with a greater LAR had higher number of leaves but lower individual leaf area. Genotypes varied significantly in time to first and 50% flowering, with Onyx-AU (black gram) and Celera II-AU flowering earliest.

Mechanical fans are often introduced to cool the indoor air. However, it has been found that the airflow from such fans is not comfortable, especially compared with natural wind. Artificial airflow in an enclosure has been known to disturb hair, irritate eyes, and distract occupants. This paper presents the result of an experimental study on the characteristics of household airflow inducing appliances. The details of experiments carried out in the laboratory are described. Four kinds of common appliances were tested and two operating conditions were chosen. The power spectrum density function was used to evaluate the airflow dynamic characteristics. The preliminary conclusion shows that the power spectrum exponent is determined by the mean air velocity and the intermittence of the air velocity profiles. However, even mechanical airflow with dynamic characteristics such as shift and intermittence cannot exactly replicate natural wind. A small ratio of height to width of the fan airflow outlets is required so that more surrounding air can be involved in the flow, and more comfortable airflow is available for occupants.",,,,,,"Gao, Ran/0000-0002-4141-0773",,,,,,,,,,,,,1473-3315,,,,,DEC,2013,12,3,,,,,257,270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000329606000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we investigate the ocean-ice atmosphere system off East Antarctica, prior to and during the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystems eXperiment [SIPEX] 2012, by exploring relationships between atmospheric and oceanic forcing together with the sea-ice and snow characteristics. During August and September 2012, just prior to SIPEX 2012, atmospheric circulation over the Southern Ocean was near-average, setting up the ocean-ice-atmosphere system for near-average conditions. However, below-average surface pressure and temperature as well as strengthened circumpolar winds prevailed during June and July 2012. This led to a new record (19.48 x 10(6) km(2)) in maximum Antarctic sea-ice extent recorded in late September. In contrast to the weak circum-Antarctic conditions, the East Antarctic sector (including the SIPEX 2012 region) experienced positive sea-ice extent and concentration anomalies during most of 2012, coincident with negative atmospheric pressure and sea-surface temperature anomalies. Heavily deformed sea ice appeared to be associated with intensified wind stress due to increased cyclonicity as well as an increased influx of sea ice from the east. This increased westward ice flux is likely linked to the break-up of nearly 80% of the Mertz Glacier Tongue in 2010, which strongly modified the coastal configuration and hence the width of the westward coastal current. Combined with favourable atmospheric conditions the associated changed coastal configuration allowed more sea ice to remain within the coastal current at the expense of a reduced northward flow in the region around 141 degrees-145 degrees E. In addition a westward propagating positive anomaly of sea-ice extent from the western Ross Sea during austral winter 2012 has been identified to have fed into the westward current of the SIPEX 2012 region. A pair of large grounded icebergs appears to have modified the local stress state as well as the structure of the ice pack upstream and also towards the Dalton Glacier Tongue. Together with the increased influx of sea ice into the regions, this contributed to the difficulties in navigating the SIPEX 2012 region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By equipping a pontoon trap with a rigid grid with vertical bars, a substantial proportion of the undersized herring can escape from the gear by swimming through the grid. However, it has not been clear whether or not the young fish are injured by their passage through a grid and what their fate is. The purpose of this study was to investigate the short term mortality of herring after passage through a grid. To capture young herring, a selection grid was mounted at the entrance to the fish chamber of a pontoon trap, so that only young herring (approximately 12-18 cm in length) could swim in. The trap was then closed and the herring were confined in the fish chamber for seven days before assessing survival rates. The same procedure was performed with control herring which were trapped without passing through any grid. The whole trial was repeated three times. On average about 7% of the young herring selected through a sorting grid died during the experiment. The results demonstrated that passing through a rigid grid did not affect the short term mortality of young herring during the seven days in captivity. The highest mortality (45%) was in fact observed in one of the control groups presumably in connection with extreme temperature fluctuations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

After sweeping the temperature, observed population distributions and coefficients of variation were in quantitative agreement with those predicted by a stochastic version of the model. Because model fluctuations originated from small molecule-number effects, the experimental validation underscores the importance of internal noise in gene expression.

However, there are a variety of situations in which the overdamped approximation is not justified, for instance, when self-propelled particles move in a low-viscosity medium or when their rotational diffusivity is enhanced by internal active processes or external control. Examples of various origins include biofilaments driven by molecular motors, living and artificial microflyers and interfacial surfers, field-controlled and superfluid microswimmers, vibration-driven granular particles and autonomous mini-robots with sensorial delays, etc. All of them extend active Brownian motion to the underdamped case, i.e., to active Langevin motion, which takes into account inertia. Despite a rich experimental background, there is a gap in the theory in the field where rotational inertia significantly affects the random walk of active particles on all time scales. In particular, although the well-known models of active Brownian and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles include a memory effect of the direction of motion, they are not applicable in the underdamped case, because the rotational inertia, which they do not account for, can partially prevent memory loss with increasing rotational diffusion. We describe the two-dimensional motion of a self-propelled particle with both translational and rotational inertia and velocity fluctuations. The proposed generalized analytical equations for the mean kinetic energy, mean-square displacement and noise-averaged trajectory of the self-propelled particle are confirmed by numerical simulations in a wide range of self-propulsion velocities, moments of inertia, rotational diffusivities, medium viscosities and observation times.",,,,,,"Lisin, Evgeny/0000-0001-5498-0321",,,,,,,,,,,,,1463-9076,1463-9084,,,,JUN 15,2022,24,23,,,,,14150,14158,,10.1039/d2cp01313d,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2cp01313d,,JUN 2022,,,,,,35648110,,,,,WOS:000804220700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Tillage, as a pervasive anthropogenic perturbation, also affects agricultural pests and their natural enemies in cropland systems. The effect of warming combined with tillage on tritrophic interactions is poorly known. A field experiment using infrared warming devices was conducted in conventional and no-tillage wheat fields in Northern China to examine the effects of warming and tillage on tritrophic interactions between winter wheat plants, aphids, and parasitoids. The results show that warming increased plant biomass and advanced plant phenology from re-greening to maturity by 6-11 days. No effects of tillage on plant phenology or biomass were found. Warming significantly increased the numbers of the aphid Sitobion avenae in 2010, when the parasitoid was scarce. Populations of S. avenae were 57.2% larger in warmed than in control plots. In 2011, aphid populations did not differ between warmed and control plots, but parasitoids were abundant, with approximately three times as many in warmed plots than in control ones. The rate of parasitism was also significantly increased in the warmed plots. Tillage had no significant effects on aphid and parasitoid populations in both years. These results indicate that the temperature-induced acceleration of winter wheat phenology resulted in increased aphid abundance. Warming strengthens the bottom-up and top-down effects. The response of parasitoids to warming varied according to their yearly population fluctuations, highlighting the need for a greater basic understanding of parasitoids and conservation of natural enemies.

Young) S.L. Welsh within plant communities creates two distinct zones; underneath (subcanopy) and between shrub canopies (interspace). The purpose the study was to determine the influence of subcanopy and interspace zones on microsite characteristics and herbaceous vegetation. Study sites were located at the Northern Great Basin Experimental Range (NGBER) (56 km west of Burns, OR) and Baker Pass (80 km southeast of Burns, OR). At the NGBER, microsite and vegetation differences existed between subcanopy and interspace zones. Compared to the interspace, subcanopy zones were characterized by lower fluctuations in soil temperature, higher levels of soil organic matter, nitrogen, carbon, and water, and greater herbaceous biomass, cover, and density. A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis appears to strongly influence the spatial arrangement of herbaceous vegetation at the NGBER. Zonal vegetation differences measured at the NGBER were not found at Baker Pass, a location with a more north-facing aspect than the NBGER. Our results suggest that the influence of A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis on herbaceous spatial heterogeneity may be greater as sites become warmer and drier. Our study demonstrated the potential of A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis to create herbaceous spatial heterogeneity, elucidated that the relationships between A. tridentata ssp. wyomingensis and herbaceous species are complex, and can be site specific.

This effect could be influenced by climate variability, especially in regions with harsh climate, such as subalpine zones. In particular, short-term extreme weather fluctuations may induce rapid plant responses, affecting in turn the response to mowing. We tested the effects of concomitant summer weather manipulation and mowing on a subalpine grassland in the Central French Alps for two consecutive years. We addressed two questions: (1) How is a subalpine grassland affected by extreme summer weather? (2) Does extreme summer weather alter mowing effects on the grassland plant diversity and functioning? We used a multi-level, integrative approach assessing the responses of six abundant plant species, as well as effects on plant community structure, biomass production, and litter decomposition rates. Extreme summer weather was simulated by increasing summer temperature by 1.1A degrees C, and decreasing summer rainfall by 80%-resulting in a 30% decrease in total annual precipitation. In addition, a heat-wave event was simulated during the first year of the experiment. This weather manipulation was combined with a late-summer mowing treatment (mown vs. unmown). Extreme summer weather mainly increased leaf senescence and decreased plant vegetative growth. Leaf litter decomposition was slowed, but only for species characterized by the fastest rates of litter decomposition. Mowing increased plant diversity by restricting the dominant grass species, thereby favoring subordinates. In the short term, this subalpine grassland was rather resistant to extreme summer weather, whereas mowing cessation remained the main factor affecting its biodiversity.",,,,,", CLEMENT/C-8589-2011; Alpes, Zone Atelier Alpes LTER/P-4132-2015","CLEMENT, Jean-Christophe/0000-0002-0841-7199; Saccone, Patrick/0000-0001-8820-593X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,APR,2014,17,3,,,,,458,472,,10.1007/s10021-013-9734-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-013-9734-4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000333130700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unfortunately, several factors can limit the export of this fruit. One of such limiting factor is the avocado seed moth, Stenoma catenifer; however, its population dynamics is barely known. Therefore, is relevant to study the environmental factors affecting population changes, aimed to improve its management. In this study, we monitored the population fluctuations of S. catenifer males and explored its relationship with temperature and relative humidity by using pheromone-baited traps in Hass avocado orchards in the state of Colima, Mexico. From June 2018 to June 2019, a total of 6,836 males of the avocado seed moth were collected, with two population peaks. The first in June-August, during the fruiting stage, and the second in December-January, coinciding with the end of fruiting and flowering stages. Fruit infestation ranged from 0.0 to 65.0% in the orchards examined. Cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis indicated that sampling time and relative humidity group together but differ from temperature. The effect of relative humidity and temperature on catches was analyzed by relating non-parametric bivariate distributions. The highest male catches were recorded at temperatures greater than 15.8 degrees C and relative humidity greater than 60% while low relative humidity did not favor moth catches.

Open-path analyzer design allows such measurements with power consumption 10-150 times below present closed-path technologies, helping to considerably expand the global coverage and improve the estimates of gas emissions and budgets, informing the remote sensing and modeling communities and policy decisions, all the way to IPCC reports. Broad-band nondispersive infrared devices have been used for open-path CO2 and H2O measurements since the late 1970s, but since recently, a growing number of new narrow-band laser-based instruments are being rapidly developed. The new design comes with its own challenges, specifically: (a) mirror contamination, and (b) uncontrolled air temperature, pressure and humidity, affecting both the gas density and the laser spectroscopy of the measurements. While the contamination can be addressed via automated cleaning, and density effects can be addressed via the Webb-Pearman-Leuning approach, the spectroscopic effects of the in situ temperature, pressure and humidity fluctuations on laser-measured densities remain a standing methodological question. Here we propose a concept accounting for such effects in the same manner as Webb et al. proposed to account for respective density effects. Derivations are provided for a general case of flux of any gas, examined using a specific example of CH4 fluxes from a commercially available analyzer, and then tested using zero-flux experiment. The proposed approach helps reduce errors in open-path, enclosed, and temperature- or pressure-uncontrolled closed-path laser-based flux measurements due to the spectroscopic effects from few percents to multiple folds, leading to methodological advancement and geographical expansion of the use of such systems providing reliable and consistent results for process-level studies, remote sensing and Earth modeling applications, and GHG policy decision-making.",,,,,,"Burba, George/0000-0003-2095-0057",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JUN,2019,25,6,,,,,2189,2202,,10.1111/gcb.14614,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14614,,,,,,,,30849208,,,,,WOS:000467441900025,View Full Record in Web of Science

The stability of mixed pastures depends on a complex of intrinsic ecosystem properties, on the variability of the environment, and on the spatial and temporal scale at which it is studied. In this paper, intrinsic ecosystem properties and processes are explored and illustrated using a simple dynamic simulation model of grass and clover interactions. Competition for light, the delayed availability of nitrogen fixed by white clover, grazing per se, preferential grazing for clover, and cutting were identified as destabilising processes. Instead, niche-differentiation, nitrogen dependence of grass and clover, and plant mechanisms to 'escape' from grazing, were identified as stabilising processes. The intrinsic stability of mixed swards depended on the balance of, and the interactions between these processes. Including the temperature as an environmental variable into the model, unstable ecosystems were stabilised by seasonal temperature fluctuations, and were either further destabilised, or stabilised by stochastic temperature fluctuations. Stable ecosystems were always destabilised by these stochastic fluctuations. It is explained how spatial heterogeneity can stabilise ecosystems, which oscillate at patch scale. Heterogeneity can be maximised by increasing the incidence of small-scale disturbances and by minimising large-scale disturbances. Finally, three concepts of stability are presented. The actual stability is defined as the stability of grasslands as measured in the field, i.e. subjected to both seasonal and stochastic environmental fluctuations. The extrinsic stability presumes the presence of seasonal, yet the absence of stochastic environmental fluctuations. The intrinsic stability represents the stability of yields in a hypothetical constant environment. It is explained how these concepts of stability can bridge the gap between experimental and theoretical studies. It is demonstrated that long-term experiments are required for the experimental analysis of grassland stability, and it is argued that the development of spatially and environmentally explicit simulation models is a prerequisite for the prototyping of management systems for mixed grasslands.

During the course of this study over the period 1997-1999, the mean temperature was around 16 degrees C in the plastic greenhouse and around 17 degrees C in the glasshouse. E. formosa was introduced at a rate of 3 adults per m 2 per week in the 1997 production cycle, and at a rate of 3 and 5 pupae per M per week in 1998 and 1999, respectively. In 1997, the adult whitefly population increased exponentially to a peak of 76 adults per plant in the plastic greenhouse, while the whitefly population in the glasshouse reached a peak of only 12 adults per plant. The percentage parasitism fluctuated between 42 and 82% in the glasshouse and between 28 and 47% in the plastic greenhouse. In 1998, the T. vaporariorum population could not be brought under control in both greenhouses and reached a peak of 80 and 53 T vaporariorum adults per plant in the plastic greenhouse and the glasshouse, respectively. Parasitism fluctuated between 55 and 97% in the glasshouse and between 32 and 84% in the plastic greenhouse. In 1999, biological control was successful in both greenhouses. Most of the time, populations of T. vaporariorum were lower than 1.2 adults per plant and parasitism by E. formosa was 80% or higher. We suggest that the higher temperature is the main reason for better parasitism in the glasshouse when compared to the plastic greenhouse.

However, patterns of underground hatching and diel digging activity prior to emergence are invisible and remain largely unknown. In this study, we acoustically monitored the activity of green turtle, Chelonia mydas, hatchlings from hatching to emergence in the field and laboratory. During the hatching period, we did not observe characteristic acoustic events corresponding to pipping and hatching. Hatchlings started digging even though there were still unhatched eggs above them, indicating that green turtles did not hatch as one synchronous group. This observation did not support our hypothesis that synchronized hatching facilitates synchronous emergence. Digging activity tended to increase at night as the hatchlings approached the sand surface and nest emergence became imminent. It is not surprising that there was diel variation in digging activity as the hatchlings approached the surface because diel fluctuations in sand temperature can provide a diel cue. Surprisingly, a diel change in digging activity was also observed when hatchlings were still at a sand depth where temperature remained relatively constant throughout the day (that is, a few days before emergence) and in the laboratory at a constant temperature. This study suggests that the diel activity pattern of hatchling green turtles may occur even in the absence of a diel temperature fluctuation cue.

J,"Suffert, F; Thompson, RN",,,,"Suffert, F.; Thompson, R. N.",,,Some reasons why the latent period should not always be considered constant over the course of a plant disease epidemic,PLANT PATHOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The latent period is a crucial life history trait, particularly for polycyclic plant diseases, because it determines how many complete infection cycles could theoretically occur during an epidemic. Experiments in controlled conditions are generally used to assess pathogenicity and host susceptibility, and also provide the opportunity to measure the distribution of latent periods in epidemiological systems. Once estimated for one or several pairs of host-pathogen genotypes, the mean value of this trait is usually considered to be fixed and is often used 'as is' in models. This review contends that the latent period can display non-negligible variability over the course of a disease epidemic, and that this variability has multiple sources, some of which have complex, antagonistic impacts. Arguments are developed for four sources of variation challenging the assumption that the latent period remains constant: (i) daily fluctuations in host temperature (or other organ-environment factors); (ii) nature of inoculum; (iii) host stage or age of host tissues; and (iv) intrapopulation competition and selection for aggressiveness traits. The review is focused on the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, making use of empirical datasets collected during the first author's research projects and a targeted literature review. Such empirical epidemiological knowledge is potentially important for epidemiological modellers. While some studies have demonstrated that the distribution of latent periods around the mean value has consequences for epidemiological dynamics, it is shown here that it might also be important for modellers to account for changes in this mean value during an epidemic. These results may be critical for improving epidemic forecasting.",,,,,"Suffert, Frédéric/AAZ-9182-2021; Suffert, Frédéric/AAG-5322-2021","Suffert, Frédéric/0000-0001-6969-3878; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-0862,1365-3059,,,,DEC,2018,67,9,,,,,1831,1840,,10.1111/ppa.12894,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppa.12894,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000449821800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

EPSCs were recorded under whole-cell voltage clamp at room temperature from Purkinje cells in slices of cerebellum from 12- to 14-day-old rats. EPSCs from individual climbing fibre (CF) inputs were identified on the basis of their large size, paired-pulse depression and all-or-none appearance in response to a graded stimulus. 2. Synaptic transmission was investigated over a wide range of experimentally imposed release probabilities by analysing fluctuations in the peak of the EPSC. Release probability was manipulated log altering the extracellular [Ca(2+)] and [Mg(2+)]. Quantal parameters were estimated from plots of coefficient of variation (CV) or variance against mean conductance by fitting a multinomial model that incorporated both spatial variation in quantal size and non-uniform release probability. This 'multiple-probability fluctuation' (MPF) analysis gave an estimate of 510 +/- 50 for the number of functional release sites (N) and a quantal size (q) of 0.5 +/- 0.03 nS (n = 6). 3. Control experiments, and simulations examining the effects of non-uniform release probability, indicate that MPF analysis provides a reliable estimate of quantal parameters. Direct measurement of quantal amplitudes in the presence of 5 mM Sr(2+), which gave asynchronous release, yielded distributions with a mean quantal size of 0.55 +/- 0.01. nS and a CV of 0.37 +/- 0.01 (n = 4). Similar estimates of q were obtained in 2 mM Ca(2+) when release probability was lowered with the calcium channel blocker Cd(2+). The non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 1 mu M) reduced both the evoked current and the quantal size (estimated with MPF analysis) to a similar degree, but did not affect the estimate of N. 4. We used MPF analysis to identify those quantal parameters that change during frequency-dependent depression at climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synaptic connections. At low stimulation frequencies, the mean release probability ((P) over bar(r)) was unusually high (0.90 +/- 0.03 at 0.033 Hz, n = 5), but as the frequency of stimulation was increased, (P) over bar(r) fell dramatically (0.02 +/- 0.01, at 10 Hz, n = 4) with no apparent change in either q or N. This indicates that the observed 50-fold depression in EPSC amplitude is presynaptic in origin. 5. Presynaptic frequency-dependent depression was investigated with double-pulse and multiple-pulse protocols. EPSC recovery, following simultaneous release at practically all sites, was slow, being well. fitted by the sum of two exponential functions (time constants of 0.35 +/- 0.09 and 3.2 +/- 0.4 s, n = 5). EPSC recovery following sustained stimulation was even slower. We propose that presynaptic depression at CF synapses reflects a slow recovery of release probability following release of each quantum of transmitter. 6. The large number of functional release sites, relatively large quantal size, and unusual dynamics of transmitter release at the CF synapse appear specialized to ensure highly reliable olivocerebellar transmission at low frequencies but to limit transmission at higher frequencies.",,,,,,"Cull-Candy, Stuart G/0000-0002-0831-8326; Silver, Robin/0000-0002-5480-6638",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3751,,,,,AUG 1,1998,510,3,,,,,881,902,,10.1111/j.1469-7793.1998.881bj.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7793.1998.881bj.x,,,,,,,,9660900,,,,,WOS:000075447700018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet our understanding of how host genotype influences the composition and stability of the coral microbiome subjected to environmental fluctuations is limited. To gain insight into the community dynamics and environmental stability of microbiomes associated with distinct coral genotypes, we assessed the microbial community associated with Acropora tenuis under single and cumulative pressure experiments. Experimental treatments comprised either a single pulse of reduced salinity (minimum of 28 psu) or exposure to the cumulative pressures of reduced salinity (minimum of 28 psu), elevated seawater temperature (+2 degrees C), elevated pCO(2) (900 ppm), and the presence of macroalgae. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence data revealed that A. tenuis microbiomes were highly host-genotype specific and maintained high compositional stability irrespective of experimental treatment. On average, 48% of the A. tenuis microbiome was dominated by Endozoicomonas. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to this genus were significantly different between host individuals. Although no signs of stress were evident in the coral holobiont and the vast majority of ASVs remained stable across treatments, a microbial indicator approach identified 26 ASVs belonging to Vibrionaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Hahellaceae, Planctomycetes, Phylobacteriaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Cryomorphaceae that were significantly enriched in corals exposed to single and cumulative stressors.

The microbial community fingerprint and specific biomarkers varied substantially from year to year, in both control and experimental treatment plots. Possible drivers of the variability included plant growth, soil moisture, and ambient temperature. Surprisingly, background variation in the microbial community was of a larger magnitude than even very significant treatment effects, and this variation appeared to constrain responses to treatment. Microbial communities were mostly not responsive or not consistently responsive to the experimental treatments. Both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biomarker abundance (16 similar to:similar to 1 ?5c) and the fungal to bacterial ratio were lower under nitrogen addition in most years. Bacterial lipid biomarker abundances (15 similar to:similar to 0 iso and 16 similar to:similar to 1 ?7c) were higher under nitrogen addition in 2002, the year of largest microbial biomass, suggesting that bacteria could respond more to nitrogen addition in years of better growth conditions. Nitrogen addition and warming led to an interactive effect on the Gram-positive bacterial biomarker and the fungal to bacterial ratio. These patterns indicate that in California grassland ecosystems, microbial communities may not respond substantially to future changes in climate and that nitrogen deposition may be a determinant of the soil response to global change.

The LPS molecule is composed of two biosynthetic entities: the lipid A - core and the O-polysaccharide (O-antigen). Most biological effects of LPS are due to the lipid A part, however, there is an increasing body of evidence also with Yersinia indicating that O-antigen plays an important role in effective colonization of host tissues, resistance to complement-mediated killing and in the resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides that are key elements of the innate immune system. The biosynthesis of O-antigen requires numerous enzymatic activities and includes the biosynthesis of individual NDP-activated precursor sugars in the cytoplasm, linkage and sugar-specific transferases, O-unit flippase, O-antigen polymerase and O-chain length determinant. Based on this enzymatic mode of O-antigen biosynthesis LPS isolated from bacteria is a heterologous population of molecules; some do not carry any O-antigen while others that do have variation in the O-antigen chain lengths. The genes required for the O-antigen biosynthesis are located in O-antigen gene clusters that in genus Yersinia is located between the hemH and gsk genes. Temperature regulates the O-antigen. expression in Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis; bacteria grown at room temperature (RT, 22-25degreesC) produce in abundance O-antigen while only trace amounts are present in bacteria grown at 37degreesC.

Hence, the dynamics of CO2 concentrations in soil can be used as an indicator for biological activity. However, there is an enormous spatial and temporal variability in soil respiration, which has led to the notion of hotspots and hot moments. This variability is attributed to the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of both plant-soil-microbiome interactions and the local conditions governing gas transport. For the characterization of a given soil, the local heterogeneities should be replaced by some meaningful average. To this end, we introduce a line sensor based on tubular gas-selective membranes that is applicable at the field scale for a wide range in water content. It provides the average CO2 concentration of the ambient soil along its length. The new technique corrects for fluctuating external conditions (i.e., temperature and air pressure) and the impact of water vapor without any further calibration. The new line sensor was tested in a laboratory mesocosm experiment where CO2 concentrations were monitored at two depths during the growth of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The results could be consistently related to plant development, plant density, and changing conditions for gas diffusion toward the soil surface. The comparison with an independent CO2 sensor confirmed that the new sensor is actually capable of determining meaningful average CO2 concentrations in a natural soil for long time periods.",,,,,"Kilian, Simone/GRF-5052-2022; Vogel, Hans-Jörg/J-9845-2016","Vogel, Hans-Jörg/0000-0003-2404-9485",,,,,,,,,,,,,1539-1663,,,,,JUN 27,2019,18,1,,,,,,,190007,10.2136/vzj2019.01.0007,http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2019.01.0007,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000473169600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For a sustainable management of marine resources, studying interactions between organisms and environment, and the associated factors and processes that will impact their life cycle and thus modulate population dynamics is a major research priority. Here, we describe black-lipped pearl oyster energy acquisition and use, and its control by temperature and food concentration within the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory framework. The model parametrization was based on literature data and a specific laboratory experiment. Model validation was carried out thanks to historical in-situ datasets and a dedicated field survey. Three theoretical environmental scenarios were built to investigate the response of the pearl oyster to environmental variations. We successfully modeled a wide range of life-stage-specific traits and processes, especially the delayed acceleration of growth after settlement. Applying the model on field data collected at three different culture sites required only one free-fitted parameter, the half saturation coefficient X-k, which controls how ingestion depends on food density. X-k integrates all variations linked to the trophic environment. Analysis of the kinetics of energy fluxes under theoretical environmental scenarios suggests that temperature variations induce seasonality of reproduction in a species thought to spawn opportunistically throughout the whole year. The major influence of food concentration fluctuations on growth rate and reproductive effort is highlighted. The model showed the lower performances associated with recovery time between food-rich and starvation periods.

To understand how snowpack controls spatiotemporal N availability, we examined seasonal N dynamics across elevation, aspect, and topographic position (hollow vs. slope) in a forested watershed in the northern Rocky Mountains. As expected, peak snow-water equivalent (SWE) was generally greater at higher elevations and on north-facing aspects. However, the effects of topographic position and snowdrift led to variability in snow accumulation at smaller spatial scales. Spatial patterns of the snowpack, in turn, influenced soil moisture and temperature, with greater SWE leading to generally higher soil moisture levels during the summer and smaller temperature fluctuations throughout the year. Wetter conditions in spring or fall generally supported greater inorganic N pools, but at the driest locations (low-elevation slope), pulses of N mineralization in summer may have played important roles in overall N dynamics. More importantly, soil moisture during the summer appeared to be more influenced by antecedent snowpack from the previous year than by current-year summer rain. Subsequently, N mineralization under snowpack may be strongly influenced by soil moisture and temperature conditions from the previous fall, before snowpack accumulation. Together, our results indicate that snowpack strongly influences N dynamics beyond the current growing season in western coniferous forests through mediation of soil moisture and temperature, and suggest that further decline in winter snowpack may affect these forests through constraints in both water and N availability.",,,,,,"Hu, Jia/0000-0001-6858-6659; Qubain, Claire/0000-0003-1277-9288",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,JUL,2019,10,7,,,,,,,e02794,10.1002/ecs2.2794,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2794,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000477912900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We have studied the self-assembly process of GMPCPP tubulins into sheet and microtubule structures using thermodynamic analysis and stochastic simulations. With the novel assumptions that tubulins can laterally interact in two different forms, and allosterically affect neighboring lateral interactions, we can explain existing experimental observations. At low temperature, the allosteric effect results in the observed sheet structure with alternating lateral interactions as the thermodynamically most stable form. At normal microtubule assembly temperature, our work indicates that a class of sheet structures resembling those observed at low temperature is transiently trapped as an intermediate during the assembly process.

The extent to which organisms persist in stressful conditions will depend on the fitness consequences of multiple simultaneously acting stressors and the genetic basis of compensatory genetic responses. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug used in livestock that is excreted in dung of treated cattle, causing severe negative consequences on non-target fauna. We evaluated the effect of a combination of heat stress and exposure to ivermectin in the yellow dung fly, Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae). In a first experiment we investigated the effects of high rearing temperature on susceptibility to ivermectin, and in a second experiment we assayed flies from a latitudinal gradient to assess potential effects of local thermal adaptation on ivermectin sensitivity. The combination of heat and ivermectin synergistically reduced offspring survival, revealing severe effects of the two stressors when combined. However, latitudinal populations did not systematically vary in how ivermectin affected offspring survival, body size, development time, cold and heat tolerance. We also found very low narrow-sense heritability of ivermectin sensitivity, suggesting evolutionary constraints for responses to the combination of these stressors beyond immediate maternal or plastic effects. If the revealed patterns hold also for other invertebrates, the combination of increasing climate warming and ivermectin stress may thus have severe consequences for biodiversity.

The available literature is biased towards gastropods, crustaceans, cnidarians and macroalgae. Focal traits were mostly environmental tolerances, which correspond to phenotypic buffering, a plasticity type that maintains a functional phenotype despite external disturbance. Almost all studies address coastal species that are already today exposed to fluctuations in temperature, pH and oxygen levels. Recommendations for future research include (i) initiation and analyses of observational and experimental temporal studies encompassing diverse phenotypic traits (including diapausing cues, dispersal traits, reproductive timing, morphology) (ii) quantification of nongenetic trans-generational effects along with components of additive genetic variance (iii) adaptive changes in microbe-host associations under the holobiont model in response to global change (iv) evolution of plasticity patterns under increasingly fluctuating environments and extreme conditions and (v) joint consideration of demography and evolutionary adaptation in evolutionary rescue approaches.",,,,,"Reusch, Thorsten B.H./G-4141-2011; Reusch, Thorsten B.

However, the water temperature exhibited large fluctuations, ranging from 16.4 to 27.6 degrees C, and high water temperature conditions (Period 1, 25.6 +/- 2.0 degrees C) enhanced the predation activity of the piscivorous fish Coreoperca herzi (C. herzi, size 89 +/- 4 mm). Statistically, the survival rates of the prey fish, Rhynchocypris oxycephalus (R. oxycephalus, size 29 +/- 1 mm), with JFSs were greater by 35.9%-46.7%, and improved as the patch volume of JFS increased. Based on both experimental observations and statistical analysis, the JFS developed in this study could reduce the chances of predator-prey encounters, minimize prey vulnerability, and thereby increase prey survival rates.",,,,,"Lee, Saeromi/AAD-7043-2022; Joo, Jin Chul/Y-9304-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2073-4441,,,,,JAN,2017,9,1,,,,,,,36,10.3390/w9010036,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9010036,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000392939900036,View Full Record in Web of Science

Combined with the results of temperature melting and contact angle in macro experiments, the sustainable service performance for PASC under freeze-thaw environment was explained in multi-scale. The results show that the effects of freeze-thaw environment on PASC's sustainable service performance are multi-scale. It is a process from macro to micro, including the fluctuation of interface transition zone, the change of contact angle, the melting of pore ice, the service performance of porous asphalt pavement and the sustainability of Sponge City. Additionally, the aging effect reduces the recovery ability of the service performance for PASC. The critical temperature (0 degrees C) is more sensitive to the interaction between aged asphalt and water (ice).

Moreover, the paper assessed the effect of the traditional mashrabiya on the indoor thermal environment and thermal comfort in a selected case study building. For this purpose, two similar rooms were investigated in a selected historic building with abundant mashrabiyas located in the Makkah Region, specifically in Old Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The field tests were conducted during a typical hot summer month with two different configurations. The study demonstrated that opening the mashrabiya allowed more airflow into the room during the day and reduced the indoor temperature by up to 2.4 degrees C as compared to the closed mashrabiya. Besides, the building envelope played an important role in preventing the high fluctuation of the indoor air temperature, where the fluctuation of the rooms air temperature ranged between 2.1 degrees C and 4.2 degrees C compared to the outdoor temperature which recorded a fluctuation between 9.4 degrees C and 16 degrees C. The data presented here can be used for the future development of the mashrabiya concept and the potential incorporation with passive cooling methods to improve its design according to the requirements of modern buildings in hot climates. Moreover, further studies and tests on mashrabiyas under different climatic conditions are required.

Parasitized mice had changes in some organ masses, decreased ability to digest food, and lower rates of glucose transport but similar total glucose transport capacity as unparasitized mice. Wild-derived house mice did not use fat stores to respond to parasitism but did increase mucosal mass in the small intestine enough to maintain glucose acquisition at a similar level to unparasitized mice. 3. Cold-exposed mice showed increased masses of some organs, lower rates of glucose transport but similar total capacity to transport glucose as warm acclimated mice. 4.

Although the Peclet numbers considered are large, we find the thermal motion to have a significant effect on the dynamics of our passive particles and can be included as a decorrelation factor in the velocity autocorrelation with a decay time proportional to the Peclet number. Similar decorrelation factors come from swimmer rotations, e.g., run and tumble motion, and apply to both entrainment and far field loop contributions. These decorrelation factors lead to active diffusivity having a weak apparent power law close to Pe 0.2 for small tracer-like particles at Peclet numbers appropriate for E. coli swimmers at room temperature. Meanwhile, the reduced hydrodynamic response of large particles to nearby forces has a corresponding reduction in active diffusivity in that regime. Together, they lead to a non-monotonic dependence of active diffusivity on particle size that can shed light on similar behavior observed in the experiments by Patteson et al.

We describe a 480 ps simulation of subtilisin in acetonitrile solution and a 450 ps simulation of subtilisin in water. Each simulation employed the all-atom AMBER force field. The calculated rms deviations, from their respective x-ray structures, were similar in each simulation, but similar to 0.5 Angstrom higher in the acetonitrile simulation. Only in the acetonitrile simulation does one helix undergo a reversible partial unwinding, which lasted for about 100 ps. The other, secondary structure elements remain intact or undergo modest fluctuations. In the aqueous simulation, the calculated and experimental temperature factors agree very well. In the acetonitrile simulation, however the calculated temperature factors are much higher than the experimental values. The larger rms deviation and thermal fluctuations noted in the acetonitrile simulation are consistent with the requirement for protein cross-linking in this crystal and a recent two-dimensional NH-exchange nmr study on horse heart cytochrome c in nonaqueous solution.

We hypothesized that host immune function fluctuates seasonally, contributing to oscillations in infection patterns in a tropical disease system. To test this hypothesis, we investigated a key host defense of amphibians against a lethal fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). We integrated two field experiments in which we perturbed amphibian skin secretions, a critical host immune mechanism, in Panamanian rocket frogs (Colostethus panamansis). We found that this immunosuppressive technique of reducing skin secretions in wild frog populations increased Bd prevalence and infection intensity, indicating that this immune defense contributes to resistance to Bd in wild frog populations. We also found that the chemical composition and anti-Bd effectiveness of frog skin secretions varied across seasons, with greater pathogen inhibition during the dry season relative to the wet season. These results suggest that the effectiveness of this host defense mechanism shifts across seasons, likely contributing to seasonal infection patterns in a lethal disease system. More broadly, our findings indicate that host immune defenses can fluctuate across seasons, even in tropical regions where temperatures are relatively stable, which advances our understanding of intra-annual cycles of infectious disease dynamics.",,,,,,"Rollins-Smith, Louise/0000-0002-5209-2459; Richards, Lora/0000-0002-8052-4378; Voyles, Jamie/0000-0002-0073-5790; Rosa, Goncalo M./0000-0002-8658-8436",,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,JUL,2022,13,7,,,,,,,e4158,10.1002/ecs2.4158,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4158,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000827238300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Measurement of NMR relaxation rate of water protons in heating cooling cycles revealed structural hysteresis in both fulvic acids. In particular, structural hysteresis was related to the delay in re-establishing water network around fulvic molecules as a result of temperature fluctuations. The experiments revealed that the structural temperature dependency and hysteresis were more pronounced in SRFA than in PPFA. This was attributed to the larger content of hydrogel-like structure in SRFA stabilized, at a larger extent, by H-bonds between carboxylic and phenolic groups.

Here we estimate the stresses induced by diurnal temperature variations using viscous, elastic, and two viscoelastic models, and various thicknesses of the debris mantle. Only the elastic and visco-elastic models are in agreement with the observations. The timing and amplitudes of the stresses in the upper 15 cm of the glacier are different among the models despite the ability of each approach to predict a diurnal increase in tension exceeding the critical threshold proposed for crevasse formation. For example, the elastic stress is several times larger than the viscous stress at the ice surface (650 vs. 250 kPa) and reaches its peak up to 5-6hr later in the night. The time lag is in line with the seismic records, suggesting that the viscous model is not appropriate. Furthermore, a debris layer of >= 50cm in thickness suppresses the diurnal fluctuations in thermal stress and therefore protects the ice from mechanical damage. We suggest that high-amplitude diurnal cooling and weak ice properties due to weathering are essential factors that influence thermal fracturing in the Himalayan environment. The ongoing expansion of seismic networks into cryospheric regions, which will be capable of detecting local thermal-contraction-induced cracks, in combination with the fact that such cracks can erode and weaken the ice, and thereby serve as meltwater and heat channels, warrants further research to better understand these near-surface processes and to monitor ice properties. Plain Language Summary Thermal fracturing is an important erosion process on the icy surfaces of solar system bodies, including Earth, Mars, and comets. However, the exact timing of this thermal fracturing process is poorly constrained, despite the need for this information to validate models, and its importance in the weathering of glacial ice is largely unknown and often overlooked. Recent seismic observations revealed nocturnal thermal fracturing of a high-altitude Himalayan debris-covered glacier. These observations in Nepal suggested that glacial ice bursted with icequakes as temperature decreased unless ice was protected with a thick debris cover. In this study we consider four different numerical approaches to describe material behaviour of ice under thermal stress in order to find out how debris modulates stresses and which method agrees with the experimental evidence. We numerically estimate thermal stress conditions near the surface of a glacier with and without debris and find that a half-of-a-meter-thick debris is sufficient to protect ice from mechanical damage induced by diurnal variation of temperature. Furthermore, our study suggests that thermal stress could be an important factor for weathering of exposed ice and that this process needs more attention since it is possible that new cracks can facilitate ablation.",,,,,"Fujita, Koji/E-6104-2010; Podolskiy, Evgeny A./A-4458-2010","Fujita, Koji/0000-0003-3753-4981; Podolskiy, Evgeny A./0000-0002-3050-4897; Sunako, Sojiro/0000-0002-0403-1950",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9003,2169-9011,,,,JUN,2019,124,6,,,,,1485,1515,,10.1029/2018JF004848,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JF004848,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000477719900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The effect on paleo-oceanography tracers,GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA,,,,,,,,,,,,"The effect of early diagenesis on trace element abundance in coral skeleton was studied in live coral heads (Porites) from the Nature Reserve Reef (NRR), flat, Gulf of Aqaba, northern Red Sea. Petrography of the corals shows diagenetic features of dissolution, recrystallization, and secondary aragonite precipitation (pore filling), which are most extensive in the oldest part of the coral. Coral porewaters were extracted with a special setup and were analyzed for chemical composition. The total alkalinity and Sr deficit in pore water as compared to reef water is consistent with both precipitation of secondary aragonite and recrystallization of primary skeleton. The present rate constant of pore filling by secondary aragonite was estimated by a water replacement experiment to be 0.0015 y(-1), which equals to pore filling rate of 1.5 +/- 0.3 kg aragonite per year. The corals show clear seasonal fluctuations in Sr/Ca ratios that: are interpreted as reflecting changes in sea surface temperature (SST). Yet, the secondary aragonite is characterized by a significantly higher Sr/Ca ratio than the average ratio in primary aragonite. Thus, measuring a mixed sample of pristine and secondary aragonite may produce erroneous (about 2 degrees C lower) SST estimates by the Sr/Ca thermometers. It appears that the Sr/Ca ratio, a major proxy for paleo-environmental marine studies, is sensitive to subtle pore-filling and replacement of the original coral matrix by secondary aragonite in the marine environment.

The effects of large-scale climate change are also likely to interact with local habitat conditions. Management actions designed to preserve threatened species therefore need to adapt both to the prevailing climate and local conditions. Yet, few studies have separated the direct and indirect effects of climatic variables on the viability of local populations and discussed the implications for optimal management. We used 30years of demographic data to estimate the simultaneous effects of management practice and among-year variation in four climatic variables on individual survival, growth and fecundity in one coastal and one inland population of the perennial orchid Dactylorhiza lapponica in Norway. Current management, mowing, is expected to reduce competitive interactions. Statistical models of how climate and management practice influenced vital rates were incorporated into matrix population models to quantify effects on population growth rate. Effects of climate differed between mown and control plots in both populations. In particular, population growth rate increased more strongly with summer temperature in mown plots than in control plots. Population growth rate declined with spring temperature in the inland population, and with precipitation in the coastal population, and the decline was stronger in control plots in both populations. These results illustrate that both direct and indirect effects of climate change are important for population viability and that net effects depend both on local abiotic conditions and on biotic conditions in terms of management practice and intensity of competition. The results also show that effects of management practices influencing competitive interactions can strongly depend on climatic factors. We conclude that interactions between climate and management should be considered to reliably predict future population viability and optimize conservation actions.",,,,,,"Ehrlen, Johan/0000-0001-8539-8967; Dahlgren, Johan/0000-0002-1125-9769",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,,,,,SEP,2013,19,9,,,,,2729,2738,,10.1111/gcb.12167,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12167,,,,,,,,23504932,,,,,WOS:000322758000012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Subtidal ( days to weeks) current variability was polarized along-isobath and dominated by episodic bursts of westward flow. The along-isobath subtidal flow was primarily geostrophic and barotropic, and was correlated with large-scale along-coast wind stress fluctuations oriented 45 degreesT (65degrees counterclockwise from the local isobath orientation). Subtidal near-surface ageostrophic transport matched estimates of wind-driven Ekman transport; however, near-bottom ageostrophic transport was much larger than estimates of Ekman transport from bottom stress. Low-frequency ( monthly and longer timescales) flow was generally westward and off-shelf at all sites and depths, with the strongest westward flow during the fall. Low-frequency along-isobath currents were primarily geostrophic with baroclinic and barotropic components of similar magnitude. Depth-averaged ageostrophic transport was quantitatively consistent with Ekman transport from wind and bottom stress. Measured bottom stress at both subtidal and low-frequency timescales was weak, nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the wind stress. Low-frequency fluctuations in the predominantly geostrophic along-isobath flow were attributable to variations in the cross-shelf density field associated with the seasonal cycle in surface heating. During the fall, thermal wind shear was strongest, because the cross-isobath temperature gradient was acting in concert with the persistent cross-isobath salinity gradient to enhance the cross-isobath density gradient (i.e., warmer and fresher water inshore). During the winter, in response to surface cooling, the cross-isobath temperature gradient reversed sign, reducing the cross-isobath density gradient (i.e., cooler and fresher water inshore).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,AUG 29,2003,108,C8,,,,,,,3281,10.1029/2002JC001417,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002JC001417,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000185253300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Storage fungi, which reduce seed quality, become active in seeds when moisture levels are 14% or higher and this is influenced by the way seeds are stored. The aim of the present study was to test germination and vigour of maize seeds that were subjected to traditional storage during 2005 and to test germination of the maize seeds after storage for one year under conditions of fluctuating temperature. A preliminary survey was conducted and maize samples (white and yellow) were collected from small-scale subsistence farmers in northern KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) and Mozambique. Seeds that were left in the field to dry and seeds that were commercially treated with Celest((R)) XL served as controls. Germination was measured according to the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) rules. The maize that was left in the field (NHS) to dry gave 100% germination in 2005. The treated control had a germination of 94.0%. Seeds that were imbibed for 40 h had the highest percentage weight increase following rapid imbibition but four of the six samples maintained germination above 70% following slow imbibition. The conductivity of the solute was read following imbibition. Field stored maize had the lowest solute leakage (1181 mu S) and this correlated with the high percentage seeds with living tissue as indicated by the tetrazolium staining following rapid (94.4%) and slow (95.8%) imbibition. The number of fungi isolated from the samples reflected the initial condition of the samples with the fungicide treated control having the lowest percentage infection (11%), NHS had 33% and yellow maize that was stored on the cob and had with insect damage (SIH) had the highest, namely 71%. After the first set of experiments, samples were stored at 26-28 degrees C to simulate the fluctuating original storage conditions. A year later the samples were subjected to the standard germination test. The decline in seed viability during the storage period was exhibited by results of the standard germination test. Maize that was left in the field had a 74.7% decrease in germination while the sample stored in potato bag (PHEG) and the treated control maintained germination above 80%. Two of the six samples failed to germinate. This study also showed that fungicide seed treatment is a viable option to maintain viability of the seeds, especially when the maize is to be stored until the next season. (c) 2007 SAAB.

J,"Hill, DL; Wall, E",,,,"Hill, Davina L.; Wall, Eileen",,,Weather influences feed intake and feed efficiency in a temperate climate,JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"A key goal for livestock science is to ensure that food production meets the needs of an increasing global population. Climate change may heighten this challenge through increases in mean temperatures and in the intensity, duration, and spatial distribution of extreme weather events, such as heat waves. Under high ambient temperatures, livestock are expected to decrease dry matter intake (DMI) to reduce their metabolic heat production. High yielding dairy cows require high DMI to support their levels of milk production, but this may increase susceptibility to heat stress. Here, we tested how feed intake and the rate of converting dry matter to milk (feed efficiency, FE) vary in response to natural fluctuations in weather conditions in a housed experimental herd of lactating Holstein Friesians in the United Kingdom. Cows belonged to 2 lines: those selected for high genetic merit for milk traits (select) and those at the UK average (control). We predicted that (1) feed intake and FE would vary with an index of temperature and humidity (THI), wind speed, and the number of hours of sunshine, and that (2) the effects of (1) would depend on the cows' genetic merit. Animals received a mixed ration, available ad libitum, from automatic feed measurement gates. Using >73,000 daily feed intake and FE records from 328 cows over 8 yr, we found that select cows produced more fat- and protein-corrected milk, and had higher DMI and FE than controls. Cows of both lines decreased DMI and fat- and protein-corrected milk but, importantly, increased FE as THI increased. This suggests that improvements in the efficiency of converting feed to milk may partially offset the costs of reduced milk yield owing to a warmer climate, at least under conditions of mild heat stress. The rate of increase in FE with THI was steeper in select cows than in controls, which raises the possibility that select cows use more effective coping tactics. This is, to our knowledge, the first longitudinal study on the effects of weather on FE. Understanding how weather influences feed intake and efficiency can help us to develop management and selection practices that optimize productivity under unfavorable weather con, ditions. This will be an important aspect of climate resilience in future.",,,,,"Hill, Davina/A-9087-2015","Hill, Davina/0000-0001-9085-6192",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0302,1525-3198,,,,MAR,2017,100,3,,,,,2240,2257,,10.3168/jds.2016-11047,http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-11047,,,,,,,,28109597,,,,,WOS:000393725900056,View Full Record in Web of Science

Studying cladode thickness fluctuations may be useful for the early prediction of plant dehydration stress. The objective of this study was to determine if age, water availability and temperature influence diel cladode shrinkage and enlargement dynamics in cactus pear. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse from April to July 2014, using cactus pear plants, equally split into irrigated and unirrigated treatments, and unrooted cladodes detached from mother plants. Soil moisture content (SMC), soil water depletion over 24-h, cladode relative water content (RWC), cladode thickness, stomatal conductance (g(s)), cladode growth rates (area increase) and nocturnal malic acid accumulation were monitored in plants of various ages. Cladode shrinkage and enlargement dynamics were assessed using stem gauges and expressed as absolute growth rate (AGR(thickness), mu m min(-1)). In unirrigated pots, drought decreased SMC, RWC,cladode thickness, cladode growth rate and gs. Younger cladodes lost water later than older ones. Detached cladodes exhibited gs activity 3-4 months after detachment. Trends of AGR(thickness) showed that there was a progressive reduction of diel swelling and shrinkage fluctuations as cladodes aged. Such fluctuations were minimized under severe drought when 1-year-old cladodes reached 8 mm thickness and a RWC of about 45%. A positive correlation was found between SMC and AGR(thickness). Temperatures were also directly correlated with AGR(thickness), although this relationship was gradually lost as SMC decreased. Overall, cactus pears were able to maintain some growth at very low hydration levels, and cladode growth was highly responsive to rehydration after long periods of drought. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, salinity and temperature conditions for the tidepool habitat of the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker) are described across a wave exposure gradient, and the selective impact of salinity on life-history traits is inferred from laboratory and held studies. I found that desiccation and osmotic stress in the tidepool habitat of T. californicus were higher at an outer coast compared to a protected site in California. In the outer coast area with high wave action, tidepool salinity varied spatially, fluctuated temporally, and was at least two times greater than seawater salinity on average; tidepools frequently dried completely. Conversely, tidepool salinity in the protected area with low wave action was moderate and did not vary spatially or temporally. Culturing females at different salinities and temperatures suggested that there is a trade-off between osmoregulatory maintenance and growth or reproduction. At high salinity age of first reproduction and interclutch interval increased, and reproductive rate decreased. Extreme salinity produced age-specific mortality in the laboratory, where juveniles suffered significantly greater mortality than adults in salinity stress experiments. Hypersaline conditions in seven natural tidepool populations were associated with a decrease in the proportion of the population composed of juveniles, and an increase in the proportion of adult females, suggesting that juveniles experienced higher mortality. Unlike previous studies of benthic organisms outside tidepools, I found that higher osmotic and desiccation stress occurred in T. californicus tidepool habitats in areas exposed to high wave energy, not in protected areas.

Frequent exposure to ambient temperatures and high irradiance levels in addition to dehydration during tidal emersion generates acute physiological stress. The ability of seaweeds like Porphya to overcome these challenges and survive in such a harsh environment has been linked to elevated reactive oxygen metabolism. The current study focused on measuring seasonal changes in antioxidant enzymes plus alterations in pigment contents and photosynthetic efficiency of P. umbilicalis plants found growing in the uppermost intertidal zone. Our results suggest that F. umbilicalis exhibits increased antioxidant metabolism, which could contribute to its success in colonizing such a stressful habitat. Elevated levels of glutathione reductase GTR, catalase and carotenoid contents during emersion suggested heightened protection against reactive oxygen species ROS damage is a necessary attribute for species in the upper intertidal regions. This hypothesis was further strengthened by the finding that the greatest antioxidant increases were observed during summer months when irradiance levels and temperatures were at their peak. Winter emersion did not elicit the same physiological response, as antioxidant levels were similar in submersed and emersed plants. For the most part, photosynthetic pigments were largely affected by sun exposure and less by emersion stress. Shaded blades maintained higher concentrations of photosynthetic pigments compared to sun exposed thalli concurring with established research. Photosynthetic efficiency measurements indicated emersion and not sun exposure was the greater facilitator of photoinhibitory damage and ROS generation at PSII. The findings of this field study strengthen previous assertions that protection via elevated antioxidant metabolism and increased PSII repair are involved in providing relief from the acute environmental stresses in the intertidal zone.

A high density area of larvae was detected in the waters east of Taiwan, where larvae were likely entrained in anticyclonic eddies after hatching. The numerical simulations indicated that spawning areas east or south of Taiwan could supply PBF larvae to the estimated nursery area located in Japanese coastal waters, irrespective of annual fluctuations in oceanographic conditions. The simulation also showed that particles released to the east of the spawning area were not successfully transported to the nursery area. The trajectories of the successful particles indicated that larvae can be transported with a low energetic cost to cooler temperate waters by utilizing the strong current of the Kuroshio or the Ryukyu Current followed by the Kuroshio. The ambient temperatures around the nursery were found to be favorable with a similar temperature range as the larval distribution area only during August to September. If they do not spawn during the period April to July, the larvae will be exposed to unfavorable water temperature conditions. We hypothesize that PBT spawn in a restricted region during a limited period (April to July) to maximize the chances of their larvae entering the nursery regions in temperate waters with low energetic costs, which ensures optimal thermal conditions for growth and survival, although the spawning area may be unfavorable for the adults due to warm water temperatures.

HARDSEEDEDNESS AND AUTUMN GERMINATION,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Studies of the germination of subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) were conducted in a controlled environment and on a northerly facing hill site at 520 m in the South Island, New Zealand. Seed of cv. Mt. Barker with an initial hard seed content of 97%, stored in soil at the hill site or at room temperature, sampled for germination testing at 15-degrees-C every 2 weeks gave a low level of germination even after long periods stored outside in soil from February through to June. Germination increased from 7-10% in February to 13-16% in June. The same seed sown in soil in February at the hill site reached a final germination of 23-24%. Insects and competition from existing vegetation were not a cause of poor establishment. Identical seed subjected to an alternating 15/35-degrees-C temperature regime gave almost twice the germination (44%) after 3 months of treatment. Forty-four percent of seed remained hard. The seed of five other cultivars of subterranean clover given similar treatment increased germination 3-8-fold during the course of exposure. The majority of seed that failed to germinate in the above experiments did so because of the development of a seed coat impervious to water, i.e., they were hard seeds although they were still viable. The natural regeneration of nine cultivars of subterranean clover was examined at the hill site. By mid April seedling numbers ranged from 65/m2 for 'Clare' to 285/m2 for 'Mt Barker'. Five cultivars had substantial amounts of seed remaining in the ground ungerminated, ranging from 54% for 'Woogenellup' to 92% for 'Howard'. Seed of five of these cultivars subjected to a fluctuating 15/35-degrees-C temperature regime softened steadily. Significant differences in the rate of softening indicate that there may be scope for selection between cultivars. These results and evidence from other subterranean clover evaluations suggest that the lack of the agricultural success of this species in New Zealand may be the result of production of a high proportion of hard seed, which remains hard and therefore fails to germinate in the autumn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-8233,1175-8775,,,,,1991,34,1,,,,,31,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991FK26100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Deeper lakes had a greater representation of predators and other large-bodied fishes. Our evaluation suggests fish assemblages are reflective of oxbow lakes water quality, which is shaped by depth.

Sudden fluctuations affect surface and subsurface flow regimes and change hydrological interactions occurring in the hyporheic zone. The hyporheic zone plays an important role for salmon embryonic development, and groundwater influx may create refuges for egg survival during low flow in hydropeaking regulated rivers. The links between salmon embryo survival and hyporheic hydrological processes during hydropeaking have hardly been investigated. A field experiment was undertaken in a 5x20m side gravel bar subject to dewatering due to hydropeaking. Eleven cylindrical boxes composed of eight compartments were placed in the permanently wet area and the ramping zone. Sixty eggs were placed in two compartments (at 10 and 30cm depth) in each box. Surface and interstitial water levels and temperatures were monitored at 2min resolution. Data were collected for a period of 3months, coinciding with early stages of salmonid egg development in this catchment. Egg compartments were checked on six occasions for survival after different hydropeaking events. Dead eggs were counted and removed. Survival rates were lower in the top compartments in the ramping zone (78%) compared with the boxes in the permanently wet area and the lowermost compartments in the ramping (survival rates >99%). With no water quality issues in the catchment and very low inputs of fine sediments in the egg compartments, exposure to dry conditions and subzero temperatures were the main factors explaining egg mortality in the top compartments of the ramping zone. The rate of survival will thus depend on the surface water and groundwater interactions. Site-specific hydrological interactions occurring in the hyporheic zone should be actively considered when managing fish populations in rivers with hydropeaking.

Cotton decomposition may be sensitive to seasonal variation in key drivers, the aim of this study therefore, was to elucidate the temporal variation in cotton strip decomposition across a land-use gradient to underpin the utility of this technique as an indicator. Twelve sites, spanning a range of water quality, related to upstream land-use intensity were sampled monthly for 16 months. Mean cotton tensile-strength loss per day ranged from 0.8% to 13.2% per day across the study sites. Cotton tensile-strength loss was significantly related to mean water temperature, the concentration of dissolved nutrients, water clarity, and dissolved ions, in linear mixed models (all p < 0.005). Results concur with other research from headwater streams, larger rivers, and mesocosm experiments where the importance of temperature and nutrient concentrations as predictors of cotton decomposition have been highlighted. Significant relationships between cotton tensile-strength loss and both land-use stress and season were detected (F = 49.54, p < 0.01 and F = 3.78, p < 0.01), however there was no interaction between season and land-use stress (F = 1.51, p = 0.19). This suggests that despite the within-site seasonal fluctuations in physicochemical drivers of cotton decomposition that were observed in this study, the pattern across the impact gradient is relatively consistent across time (i.e. sites under greater land-use stress will have higher rates of cotton decomposition regardless of season). Despite intrinsic site-to-site variability, our results suggest that, after temperature, nutrient enrichment is likely to be an overriding factor in determining cotton decomposition. The relationship with land-use stress provides support for the use of cotton strip assays as a standardised method for assessing ecosystem health in non-wadeable rivers at a regional scale, however further reference benchmarks may be required for wider application and this provides an interesting avenue for further research. In addition, further research to determine the sensitivity of the method to changes in catchment management and river restoration is required.",,,,,"Atalah, Javier/AAV-9077-2021","Atalah, Javier/0000-0003-0625-3431; Ozkundakci, Deniz/0000-0002-5442-4576",,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,JAN,2020,108,,,,,,,,105773,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105773,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000493902400084,View Full Record in Web of Science

The soil pool of bulk N in the forest accounted for up to 866gN m(-2) (0-50cm), whereas up to 1.7% (14.6gNm(-2)) was potassium chloride (KCl)-extractable inorganic N. Ammonium was a dominant form of inorganic N. The size of the soil inorganic N pool fluctuated seasonally. It was small in the beginning of the summer and increased rapidly once the cumulative degree day of the soil temperature at 20cm reached more than 300 (degrees C days), indicating that active N mineralization began at some point from the middle of July to the beginning of August. This soil pool of inorganic N that had accumulated at the end of the previous summer was consumed by the beginning of the next summer through microbial immobilization, which may have begun in September. Recycling of N in the soil was important because the input of inorganic N by deposition was very small (48mgNm(-2) year(-1)). A tracer N-15 experiment showed that larch did not uptake organic N in the form of amino acid (alanine); rather, it used ammonium and nitrate as N sources. The amount of available N for plants was assessed as water-extractable inorganic N in the soil solution that was transported to the rooting area by mass flow driven by plant transpiration, and it accounted for 1.9x10(3) (1.2x10(3) for trees) mg N m(-2) during the growing season(-1) (0-50cm of the mineral soil layer in June, July, and August). Microorganisms in the soil are also expected to be competing for this available N.

J,"Singh, SN",,,,"Singh, SN",,,Exploring correlation between redox potential and other edaphic factors in field and laboratory conditions in relation to methane efflux,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"Methane is primarily a biogenic gas, which is implicated in global warming. Although its production in the anoxic conditions is regulated by several edaphic factors, aquatic macrophytes also influence methane emission by providing aerenchyma to act as chimney for CH4 transport from the sediment to troposphere, by releasing root exudates to the sediment to serve as substrate for methanogenic bacteria and by transporting atmospheric O-2 to rhizosphere, which stimulates CH4 consumption. Among the edaphic factors, redox potential (Eh) is the most important, which largely determines the action of methanogenic bacteria. Hence, a study was undertaken first to find out the correlation between CH4 emission and edaphic factors in the field conditions and then to understand the relationship between Eh and other edaphic factors. The field studies revealed that natural wetlands were the major source of CH4 emission, and the vegetation plays an important role in CH4 emission from the water bodies. However, it was very difficult to establish a strong relationship between the CH4 emission and the edaphic factors in the field conditions due to other limiting factors and their constant fluctuations. In this connection, the laboratory experiments exhibited that soil temperature, pH, moisture regime and incubation period were negatively correlated with Eh, which determines the initiation of methanogenic process. However, organic carbon and the water regime over the soil surface did not show any impact on Eh in this study. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Ecologically meaningful parameters characterizing germination capacity (or dormancy) are needed to advance our understanding of the evolution of germination strategies within plant communities. The germination traits commonly examined (e.g., maximum germination percentage under optimal conditions) may not adequately reflect the critical ecological differences in germination behavior across species, communities, and seasons. In particular, most seeds exhibit primary dormancy at dispersal that is alleviated by exposure to dry after-ripening or to hydrated chilling to enable germination in a subsequent favorable season. Population-based threshold (PBT) models of seed germination enable quantification of patterns of germination timing using parameters based on mechanistic assumptions about the underlying germination physiology. We applied the hydrothermal time (HTT) model, a type of PBT model that integrates environmental temperature and water availability, to study germination physiology in a guild of coexisting desert annual species whose seeds were after-ripened by dry storage under different conditions. We show that HTT assumptions are valid for describing germination physiology in these species, including loss of dormancy during after-ripening. Key HTT parameters, the hydrothermal time constant (theta(HT)) and base water potential distribution among seeds (psi(b)(g)), were effective in describing changes in dormancy states and in clustering species exhibiting similar germination syndromes. theta(HT) is an inherent species-specific trait relating to timing of germination that correlates well with long-term field germination fraction, while psi(b)(g) shifts with depth of dormancy in response to after-ripening and seasonal environmental variation. Predictions based on variation among coexisting species in theta(HT) and psi(b)(g) in laboratory germination tests matched well with 25-yr observations of germination dates and fractions for the same species in natural field conditions.

Here we show that mesopelagic fishes dominate the otolith (ear bone) record in anoxic sediment layers of the Santa Barbara Basin over the past two millennia. Among these mesopelagic fishes, otoliths from families Bathylagidae (deep-sea smelts) and Myctophidae (lanternfish) are most abundant. Otolith deposition rate fluctuates at decadal to centennial time scales and covaries with proxies for upper ocean temperature, consistent with climate forcing. Moreover, otolith deposition rate and proxies for temperature and primary productivity show contemporaneous discontinuities during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age. Mesopelagic fishes may serve as proxies for future climatic influence at those depths including effects on the carbon cycle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-1723,,,,,OCT 8,2019,10,,,,,,,,4564,10.1038/s41467-019-12600-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12600-z,,,,,,,,31594950,,,,,WOS:000489101100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Measurements at the debris-free Parlung No. 4 Glacier and the debris-covered 24 K Glacier in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau were carried out to compare the meteorology and surface energy fluxes and to understand the factors controlling the melting process. The meteorological comparisons displayed temporally synchronous fluctuations in air temperature, relative humidity and incoming longwave radiation (L-in), but notable differences in precipitation, incoming shortwave radiation (S-in) and wind speed. Under the prevailing regional precipitation and debris conditions, more L-in (42 W m(-2)) was supplied from warmer and more humid air and more S-in (58 W m(-2)) was absorbed at the 24 K Glacier. The relatively high energy supply led mainly to an increased energy output via turbulent heat fluxes and outgoing longwave radiation, rather than glacier melting beneath the thick debris. The sensitivity experiment showed that melt rates were sensitive to energy supply at debris thicknesses <similar to 10 cm. In contrast, energy supply to the Parlung No. 4 Glacier mainly resulted in snow/ice melting, the magnitude of which was significantly influenced by energy supplied by S-in and the sensible heat flux.",,,,,"Nan, Yi/W-3683-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1430,1727-5652,,,,DEC,2017,63,242,,,,,1090,1104,,10.1017/jog.2017.77,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2017.77,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000418852500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methodology: Pathogenicity of A. besseyi on tuberose cv. Calcutta single was carried out with eight treatments and three replications. The freshly collected A. besseyi was inoculated into tuberose. Observations on plant growth parameters, disease severity and nematode populations were taken and analysed. The population of A. besseyi in tuberose cv. Bidhan Rajani-3 was monitored from the plots of a different set of experiment. Nematode population from flower samples collected from fixed plots at monthly interval during the crop growing period were extracted and estimated. Results: Inoculation of nematodes at higher levels progressively decreased plant growth parameters as compared to uninoculated ones. The inoculated plants displayed typical symptoms of foliar nematode infestation; the outer surface of flower stalk appeared rough, growth stunted, flower stalks distorted, stalk bearing a few florets even failed to bloom. An initial inoculum density of 100 nematodes per plant was found to be pathogenic in tuberose causing significant reduction in yield and quality of flower. Monitoring nematode population during the plant growth period (cv. Bidhan Rajani-3) revealed that A. besseyi maintained maximum population during rainy season coinciding with the start of heavy flush of tuberose and minimum during December to February. Interpretation: An initial inoculum density of 100 A. besseyi per plant was considered pathogenic to tuberose.

The substantial downward transportation of regional pollution from high layers and stagnant weather conditions favorable for the local pollution accumulation were the two main causes of the rapid increase in pollutant concentration. Southwest wind speeds of 4 m/s between 300 and 600 m and obvious downward flows were observed, whereas the southwest wind speeds were low below 300 m, and strong temperature inversion with intensity of 4.5 degrees C/100 m expanded vertically to a height of 600 m. Two peaks of PM2.5 concentration were observed at 200 and 700 m, corresponding to 235 and 215 mu g/m(3), respectively. The frequent change in wind direction and wind speeds resulted in the fluctuation of PM2.5 concentration. The turbulence within lower layers of the troposphere was enhanced by easterly and northerly winds which decreased the pollution level; however, the strength and stretching height of the winds were insufficient to fully clear the air of pollutants. The PM2.5 concentration revealed 2-high concentration layers in the vertical direction. The maximum concentration layer was below 100 m, while the second high-concentration layer was at 400 m.

A.",,,CHARACTERIZATION OF AMMONIUM SORPTION BY BEEF CATTLE FEEDYARD MANURE,TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ammonia (NH3) emissions from beef cattle feedyards represent a loss of agronomically important N and can potentially affect the environment. Sorption of ammonium (NH4+) and NH3 by mineral and otganic solids decreases the proportion of free, aqueous ammoniacal N, which reduces volatilization potential. In the U.S., the High Plains region of Texas is subject to arid conditions with widely fluctuating temperatures. Furthermore, feedyard manure contains little soil and has high dry matter (DM) content; therefore, it is unclear if sorption parameters determined for soils or liquid manure systems are valid for feedyards. Our objectives were to use batch equilibration experiments to characterize NH4+ sorption by two feedyard manures. Kinetic and isotherm studies with (NH4)(2)SO4/0.01 M CaCl2 solutions revealed that feedyard manures could sorb up to 227 cmol kg(-1) NH4+-N and that sorption was rapid and linearly related to NH4+ concentration. The Freundlich partitioning coefficient (K-p) for NH4+ sorption averaged 13.3 L kg(-1). From 58% to 96% of the sorbed NH4+ was readily desorbable with 0.01 M CaCl2, and up to 81% was volatilized as NH3 when manures were air-dried. Temperature influenced sorption, with 112% more NH4+ sorption at 4 degrees C than at 22 degrees C. These results indicate that NH4+ sorption by manure on feedyard surfaces may temporarily reduce NH3 volatilization, particularly during winter.",,,,,"Todd, Robert/GWM-4486-2022","Waldrip, Heidi/0000-0001-7714-5417",,,,,,,,,,,,,2151-0032,2151-0040,,,,JUL-AUG,2012,55,4,,,,,1609,1619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000309089900038,View Full Record in Web of Science

The sheep were each infected intravenously via the jugular vein with approximately 2.0 x 10(6) T. evansi parasites. The effects of the parasite on body temperature, packed cell. volume (PCV), haemoglobin, erythrocytes, total protein, were monitored three times a week for approximately 9 weeks. Body weights were determined once every week for the duration of the experiment. The results showed that all the infected sheep were positive for the parasite. The prepatent period varied between 3 and 6 days. I: evansi produced parasitaemic waves at an average of 8.3 days interval. Two distinct forms of the disease were produced namely, acute (4-14 days postinfection), and chronic (43-59 days postinfection). Anaemia was a distinct feature of the disease. While the mean rectal temperatures were significantly elevated (P < 0.05), the mean values of the haematological parameters of the infected sheep dropped significantly (P < 0.05) compared to the preinfection levels. Observed clinical signs included pale mucous membrane, epiphora, loss of appetite, emaciation, dullness and rough hair coat together with fluctuating pyrexia which in most cases coincided with rise in parasitaemia. It is suggested that the isolate of I: evansi is pathogenic for Yankasa sheep. (C)1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Horizontal pattern of the temperature error in the mixed-layer is mainly explained by horizontal advection and surface heat flux fluctuations.

We examined the frozen soil dynamics and N2O and CO2 efflux in a forest plantation (Populus ssp.) and farmland. The experiments were carried out at a forest reclamation site in Zhangbei county, Hebei province, China, from November 2017 to May 2018. Compared to the farmland, the forest plantation prolonged the retention of frozen soil because the shallower snow and the longer duration of snow cover in the forest contributed to a deeper frost depth and delayed soil thawing. The canopy also sheltered the frozen soil from the extreme fluctuations in freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) during the snow-free period. Contrasting snow regimes and FTC dynamics contributed to variations in CO2 and N2O between the forest plantation and the farmland. Path analysis showed that the soil water content and soil temperature were the main regulators of N2O and CO2 emissions, respectively, in both land-use types. By contrast, soil substrate and microorganism biomass minimally influenced N2O and CO2 efflux. In conclusion, forest cover influences frozen soil dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions by buffering temperature fluctuations in both snow-covered and snow-free periods. This study further highlights the potential importance of anthropogenic land-use changes in influencing the cold season energy balance and gas efflux in future milder winter climates.

To shorten the calculating time, a fast-response thermal load calculation scheme has been proposed which has optimized iterative error, and the calculating time can be finally reduced to 0.95 s when time step is 50 s. To validate the reliability of this model, several tests have been carried out under ambient conditions. The tests results show that the interior temperature error is within 5% between simulated value and experimental data. Also the simulated conduction thermal load gained through cabin panels except bottom panel closely follows the heat conduction measured by HEM-215 which both value fluctuate around 900 W. In addition, detailed analysis on how to reduce the thermal conduction load is put forward in this paper, which shows that cutting down thermal conductivity of envelopes will be the most effective method among thickness, thermal conductivity and special heat capacity of envelopes.

The thaw depth obtained the maximum range, which was the primary factor for the width-to-depth ratio of rills in the black soil; whereas, the flow rate obtained the maximum range as the primary factor for rill erosion in black soil and albic soil. The number of FT cycles had a minor effect on rill erosion in the two soils. Under the same conditions, the rill morphology showed a large difference between the two soils, and higher rill erosion occurred in albic soil than black soil. Rill erosion was relatively high in black soil and albic soil when the FT temperature fluctuated around 0 degrees C during freezing-thawing.
