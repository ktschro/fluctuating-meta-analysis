Such models ignore the effects of time dependence-the temporal pattern and duration of temperature exposure-on performance. We developed and solved a simple mathematical model for growth rate of ectotherms, combining thermal performance curves for ingestion rate with the temporal dynamics of gene expression and protein production in response to high temperatures to predict temporal patterns of growth rate in constant and diurnally fluctuating temperatures. We used the model to explore the effects of heat shock proteins on larval growth rates of Manduca sexta. The model correctly captures two empirical patterns for larval growth rate: first, maximal growth rate and optimal temperature decline with increasing duration of temperature exposure; second, mean growth rates decline with time in diurnally fluctuating temperatures at higher mean temperatures. These qualitative results apply broadly to cases where proteins or other molecules produced in response to high temperatures reduce growth rates. We discuss some of the critical assumptions and predictions of the model and suggest potential extensions and alternatives. Incorporating time-dependent effects will be essential for making more realistic predictions about the physiological and ecological consequences of temperature fluctuations and climate change.","[Kingsolver, Joel G.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Woods, H.

Because thermal performance curves are non-linear, mean performance can differ in fluctuating and constant thermal environments. However, time-dependent effects - effects of the order and duration of exposure to temperature - can also influence mean performance. We quantified the non-linear and time-dependent effects of diurnally fluctuating temperatures for larval growth rates in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta L., with four main results. First, the shape of the thermal performance curve for growth rate depended on the duration of exposure: for example, optimal temperature and thermal breadth were greater for growth rates measured over short (24 h during the last instar) compared with long (the entire period of larval growth) time periods. Second, larvae reared in diurnally fluctuating temperatures had significantly higher optimal temperatures and maximal growth rates than larvae reared in constant temperatures. Third, for larvae maintained at three mean temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three diurnal temperature ranges (+/- 0, +/- 5 and +/- 10 degrees C), diurnal fluctuations had opposite effects on mean growth rates at low versus high mean temperature. Fourth, both short-and long-term thermal performance curves yielded poor predictions of the non-linear effects of fluctuating temperature on mean growth rates (compared with our experimental results) at higher mean temperatures. Our results suggest caution in using constant temperature studies to model the consequences of variable thermal environments.","[Kingsolver, Joel G.; Higgins, Jessica K.; Augustine, Kate E.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Kingsolver, JG (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.","jgking@bio.unc.edu","","","US National Science Foundation [IOS-1120500]; Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences [1120500] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Integrative Organismal Systems; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This research was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation [IOS-1120500 to J.G.K.].",NA,"52","104","106","2","64","COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 4DL, CAMBS, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

For example, these rates may be described as a function of light for plants or organic food resources for animals and these could be regulated (or not) by temperature or other conditions. But, what are the consequences for an individual's growth (and also for the population growth) if growth rate variations are themselves dynamic and not steady state? For organisms presenting phases of dormancy or long periods of stress, this is a crucial question. A dynamic perspective for quantifying short-term growth was explored using the daily growth record of the scallop Pecten maximus (L). This species is a good biological model for ectotherm growth because the shell records growth striae daily. Independently, a generic mathematical function representing the dynamics of mean daily growth rate (MDGR) was implemented to simulate a diverse set of growth patterns. Once the function was calibrated with the striae patterns, the growth rate dynamics appeared as a forced damped oscillation during the growth period having a basic periodicity during two transitory phases (mean duration 43 days) and appearing at both growth start and growth end. This phase is most likely due to the internal dynamics of energy transfer within the organism rather than to external forcing factors. After growth restart, the transitory regime represents successive phases of over-growth and regulation. This pattern corresponds to a typical representation of compensatory growth, which from an evolutionary perspective can be interpreted as an adaptive strategy to coping with a fluctuating environment.

While estimating the temperature dependence of performance traits such as growth and development rate is feasible under controlled laboratory settings, predictions in nature are difficult. One major challenge lies in translating performance under constant conditions to fluctuating environments. Using the butterfly Pieris napi as model system, we show that development rate, an important fitness trait, can be accurately predicted in the field using models parameterized under constant laboratory temperatures. Additionally, using a factorial design, we show that accurate predictions can be made across microhabitats but critically hinge on adequate consideration of non-linearity in reaction norms, spatial heterogeneity in microclimate and temporal variation in temperature. Our empirical results are also supported by a comparison of published and simulated data. Conclusively, our combined results suggest that, discounting direct effects of temperature, insect development rates are generally unaffected by thermal fluctuations.","[von Schmalensee, Loke; Hulda Gunnarsdottir, Katrin; Gotthard, Karl; Lehmann, Philipp] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, Stockholm, Sweden; [Naslund, Joacim] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Resources, Uppsala, Sweden","Stockholm University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","von Schmalensee, L (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, Stockholm, Sweden.","loke.von.schmalensee@zoologi.su.se","von Schmalensee, Loke/AAD-7360-2022; Lehmann, Philipp/AEO-0158-2022","von Schmalensee, Loke/0000-0003-3233-4905","Vetenskapsradet [2017-04159]; Svenska Forskningsradet Formas [2017-00965]","Vetenskapsradet(Swedish Research Council); Svenska Forskningsradet Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas)","Vetenskapsradet, Grant/Award Number: 2017-04159; Svenska Forskningsradet Formas, Grant/Award Number: 2017-00965",NA,"79","17","17","5","20","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1461-023X","1461-0248","","ECOL LETT","Ecol.

Yet, while both mean temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs) are expected to increase under global warming, latitudinal differences in the effects of DTFs have not been documented. We tested whether low-latitude populations of an ectotherm deal better with greater DTF than high-latitude populations, especially at a high mean temperature close to the optimal temperature for growth where DTF causes exposure to extreme high temperatures. We evaluated the impact of DTFs when assessing the effect of gradual thermal evolution at the high latitude with a space-for-time substitution. We compared effects of both mean temperatures (20 and 24 degrees C) and DTFs (constant=0 degrees C, low=5 degrees C and high=10 degrees C) on growth rates between low-latitude and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans in a common-garden experiment. DTFs, if anything, reduced growth and were generally stressful as indicated by reductions in body condition, antioxidant defence and metabolic rate, and increases in oxidative damage. Most negative effects of DTFs were only present at a mean of 24 degrees C when too high temperatures were reached during a daily cycle. Notably, while 4 degrees C warming was beneficial in terms of growth rate at both latitudes at a constant temperature regime, this changed in a negative effect at high DTF. Moreover, this modulating effect of the mean temperature by DTF differed between latitudes indicating local thermal adaptation. While 4 degrees C warming at low DTF still caused faster growth in low-latitude larvae, it already slowed growth in high-latitude larvae. This supports the emerging insight that warming would increase growth in high-latitude larvae in the absence of DTF, yet would decrease growth in the more realistic scenarios with DTF. In contrast, a space-for-time substitution approach suggested that under gradual thermal evolution, the evolved high-latitude larvae would no longer suffer a growth reduction in the presence of DTF. Our study provided important proof-of-principle that jointly integrating gradual thermal evolution and the expected increase in DTF generates opposing predictions of effects of global warming on this ectotherm.","[Verheyen, Julie; Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium","KU Leuven","Verheyen, J (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium.","julie.verheyen@kuleuven.be","Stoks, Robby/AAK-1227-2020","Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459; Verheyen, Julie/0000-0001-7496-5137","FWO [G.0524.17]; KU Leuven grant [C16/17/002]","FWO(FWO); KU Leuven grant","We thank Philippe Lambret, Dinh Van Khuong, Kent Olsen and Ulf Norling for collecting the damselfly eggs, Ria Van Houdt for the physiological analyses and assistance during the experiment, Geert Neyens and Rony Van Aerschot for technical support and Vienna Delnat for assistance during the experiment.

Once all individuals reached adulthood, we exposed each individual to a ramping temperature event (starting at 25 degrees C and ramping the temperature at 0.25 degrees C min(-1)) and assessed their metabolic rates (VCO2) responses at specific temperature 'bins' (25, 30, 35, 40 and 42 degrees C). Sex but not diet influenced respiration and metabolic rate. Male individuals, on average, had a higher VCO2 than females. Sex and diet were significant influences on VCO2 at different temperatures. Metabolic rates at lower temperatures were not affected by sex or diet type. At 35 degrees C, metabolic rates were influenced by sex and diet, with males reared on bramble and tree lucerne having a higher metabolic rate than females reared on the same foodplant, whereas Eucalypt reared animals showing an opposite trend. Lifetime egg production by females was 150% higher on bramble compared with the other host plants.

Mechanisms that reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of DTFs. Species that experience varying degrees of DTFs in their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to DTFs, tadpoles from habitats characterised by small DTFs would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large DTFs. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24 degrees C) and DTF treatments (20-30 degrees C and 18-38 degrees C). DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats (similar to 15%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats (similar to 30%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although DTFs induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6 degrees C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal variability may favour some species while others are negatively impacted. Species that cannot compensate for increased variability by buffering growth and development will probably be most affected.","[Kern, Pippa; Cramp, Rebecca L.; Franklin, Craig E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","University of Queensland","Kern, P (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.","pippa.kern@uqconnect.edu.au","Cramp, Rebecca L/A-4488-2010; Franklin, Craig/G-7343-2012; Kern, Pippa/AAU-5236-2020","Cramp, Rebecca L/0000-0001-9798-2271; Franklin, Craig/0000-0003-1315-3797; Kern, Pippa/0000-0001-8658-2811","University of Queensland; Australian Research Council; Queensland Government Department of Environment and Heritage Protection [WISP10930412]; University of Queensland Native and Exotic Wildlife and Marine Animal Ethics Committee [SBS/024/12/URG]","University of Queensland(University of Queensland); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Queensland Government Department of Environment and Heritage Protection; University of Queensland Native and Exotic Wildlife and Marine Animal Ethics Committee","P.K. was funded by a University of Queensland postgraduate scholarship.

However, TPCs are typically assessed under constant temperature regimes, so their reliability for predicting thermal responses in the wild where temperature fluctuates diurnally and seasonally remains poorly documented. Here, we use distant latitudinal populations of five species of sepsid flies (Diptera: Sepsidae) from the temperate region (Europe, North Africa, North America) to compare estimates derived from constant TPCs with observed development rate under fluctuating temperatures in laboratory and field conditions. TPCs changed across gradients in that flies originating from higher latitudes showed accelerated development at higher temperatures, an adaptive response. TPCs were then used to predict development rates observed under fluctuating temperatures; these predictions were relatively accurate in the laboratory but not the field. Interestingly, the precision of TPC predictions depended not only on the resolution of temperature data, with daily and overall temperature summing performing better than hourly temperature summing, but also on the frequency of temperatures falling below the estimated critical minimum temperature. Hourly temperature resolution most strongly underestimated actual development rates, because flies apparently either did not stop growing when temperatures dropped below this threshold, or they sped up their growth when the temperature rose again, thus most severely reflecting this error. We conclude that when flies do not encounter cold temperatures, TPC predictions based on constant temperatures can accurately reflect performance under fluctuating temperatures if adequately adjusted for nonlinearities, but when encountering cold temperatures, this method is more error-prone. Our study emphasizes the importance of the resolution of temperature data and cold temperatures in shaping thermal reaction norms.","[Khelifa, Rassim; Blanckenhorn, Wolf U.; Roy, Jeannine; Rohner, Patrick T.; Mandjoub, Hayat] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland; [Khelifa, Rassim] Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada","University of Zurich; University of British Columbia","Khelifa, R (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Zurich, Switzerland.;Khelifa, R (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Bot, Vancouver, BC, Canada.","erassimkhelifa@gmail.com","Rohner, Patrick/P-6250-2019","Rohner, Patrick/0000-0002-9840-1050; Khelifa, Rassim/0000-0001-6632-8787; Mahdjoub, Hayat/0000-0002-8972-9628; Blanckenhorn, Wolf/0000-0002-0713-3944","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung [P2ZHP2_ 175028, SNF 31003A-143787]","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(Austrian Science Fund (FWF))","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Forderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, Grant/Award Number: P2ZHP2_ 175028 and SNF 31003A-143787",NA,"76","17","17","1","28","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-8790","1365-2656","","J ANIM ECOL","J.

Few studies have examined whether ectotherms acclimate to diurnal temperature fluctuations, or how natural and domesticated populations differ in their responses to diurnal fluctuations. We examine how diurnally fluctuating temperatures during development affect growth, acclimation, and stress responses for two populations of Manduca sexta: a field population that typically experiences wide variation in mean and fluctuations in temperature, and a laboratory population that has been domesticated in nearly constant temperatures for more than 300 generations. Laboratory experiments showed that diurnal fluctuations throughout larval development reduced pupal mass for the laboratory but not the field population. The differing effects of diurnal fluctuations were greatest at higher mean temperature (30 degrees C): Here diurnal fluctuations reduced pupal mass and increased pupal development time for the laboratory population, but had little effect for the field population. We also evaluated how mean and fluctuations in temperature during early larval development affected growth rate during the final larval instar as a function of test temperature. At an intermediate (25 degrees C) mean temperature, both the laboratory and field population showed a positive acclimation response to diurnal fluctuations, in which subsequent growth rate was significantly higher at most test temperatures. In contrast at higher mean temperature (30 degrees C), diurnal fluctuations significantly reduced subsequent growth rate at most test temperatures for the laboratory population, but not for the field population. These results suggest that during domestication in constant temperatures, the laboratory population has lost the capacity to tolerate or acclimate to high and fluctuating temperatures. Population differences in acclimation capacity in response to temperature fluctuations have not been previously demonstrated, but they may be important for understanding the evolution of reaction norms and performance curves.","[Kingsolver, Joel G.; Moore, M.

We present a mathematical model that links thermal performance curves (TPCs) of photosynthesis, respiration, and carbon allocation efficiency to the exponential growth rate of a population of photosynthetic autotroph cells. Using experiments with the green alga, Chlorella vulgaris, we apply the model to show that the temperature dependence of carbon allocation efficiency is key to understanding responses of growth rates to warming at both ecological and longer-term evolutionary timescales. Finally, we assemble a dataset of multiple terrestrial and aquatic autotroph species to show that the effects of temperature-dependent carbon allocation efficiency on potential growth rate TPCs are expected to be consistent across taxa. In particular, both the thermal sensitivity and the optimal temperature of growth rates are expected to change significantly due to temperature dependence of carbon allocation efficiency alone. Our study provides a foundation for understanding how the temperature dependence of carbon allocation determines how population growth rates respond to temperature.","[Garcia-Carreras, Bernardo; Sal, Sofia; Kontopoulos, Dimitrios-Georgios; Pawar, Samrat] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Padfield, Daniel; Bestion, Elvire; Schaum, C. -Elisa; Yvon-Durocher, Gabriel] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England; [Garcia-Carreras, Bernardo] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Schaum, C. -Elisa] Univ Hamburg, Inst Marine Okosyst & Fischereiwissensch, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany","Imperial College London; University of Exeter; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Hamburg","Garcia-Carreras, B; Pawar, S (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England.;Garcia-Carreras, B (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.","bgarciacarreras@gmail.com; s.pawar@imperial.ac.uk","Pawar, Samraat/E-7388-2012; Bestion, Elvire/D-4281-2015; Kontopoulos, Dimitrios - Georgios/H-5822-2019; Garcia-Carreras, Bernardo/H-3234-2011","Pawar, Samraat/0000-0001-8375-5684; Bestion, Elvire/0000-0001-5622-7907; Kontopoulos, Dimitrios - Georgios/0000-0002-5082-1929; Garcia-Carreras, Bernardo/0000-0002-0714-300X; Padfield, Daniel/0000-0001-6799-9670; Sal, Sofia/0000-0001-9006-9930","Natural Environment Research Council [NE/M003205/1]; Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Partnership scholarship; NERC [NE/M004740/1, NE/M003205/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Partnership scholarship; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","We thank Mridul Thomas and Van Savage for valuable discussions and comments on previous versions of the manuscript.

It was hypothesized that the development rate lines of ectotherms within a taxon such as a family would have a common intersection. Thus for a given temperature, the development time should be the same for all the species within any specified taxon. In the current study, the data on temperature-dependent development rates of species of the Aphididae and Tetranychidae families were used to test the validity of the common-intersection hypothesis. The hypothesis was supported with either dataset used. In addition, the current study tested the common-intersection hypothesis through mathematical analysis on the basis of two linear relationships (i.e., the linear relationship between temperature and development rate and that between the lower developmental threshold and the sum of effective temperatures). An attempt was made to combine the rate isomorphy hypothesis that all the lower developmental thresholds of different stages were assumed to be equal for a single species with the common-intersection hypothesis for related species within a taxon and hypothesize that if these two hypotheses hold, then for any developmental stages a common temperature of all stages should exist.

Early life experiences can have lasting impacts on how individuals respond to environmental variation later in life (i.e., individual reaction norms), altering the capacity for populations to respond to selection. Here, we incubated lizard embryos (Lampropholis delicata) at two fluctuating developmental temperatures (cold= 23 degrees C +/ - 3 degrees C, hot( )= 29 degrees C + / - 3 degrees C , n(cold) = 26, n(hot) = 25) to understand how it affected metabolic plasticity to temperature later in life. We repeatedly measured individual reaction norms across six temperatures 10 times over - similar to 3.5 months (n(obs) = 3,818) to estimate the repeatability of average metabolic rate (intercept) and thermal plasticity (slope). The intercept and the slope of the population-level reaction norm was not affected by developmental temperature. Repeatability of average metabolic rate was, on average, 10% lower in hot incubated lizards but stable across all temperatures. The slope of the thermal reaction norm was overall moderately repeatable (R = 0.44, 95% CI= 0.035 - 0.93) suggesting that individual metabolic rate changed consistently with short-term changes in temperature, although credible intervals were quite broad. Importantly, reaction norm repeatability did not depend on early developmental temperature. Identifying factors affecting among-individual variation in thermal plasticity will be increasingly more important for terrestrial ectotherms living in changing climate. Our work implies that thermal metabolic plasticity is robust to early developmental temperatures and has the capacity to evolve, despite there being less consistent variation in metabolic rate under hot environments.","[Kar, Fonti; Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ New South Wales, Ecol & Evolut Res Ctr, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Noble, Daniel W.

These projections rarely account for how temporal variation in temperature can systematically modify growth rates relative to projections based on constant temperatures. Here, we tested the hypothesis that time-averaged population growth rates in fluctuating thermal environments differ from growth rates in constant conditions as a consequence of Jensen's inequality, and that the thermal performance curves (TPCs) describing population growth in fluctuating environments can be predicted quantitatively based on TPCs generated in constant laboratory conditions. With experimental populations of the green alga Tetraselmis tetrahele, we show that nonlinear averaging techniques accurately predicted increased as well as decreased population growth rates in fluctuating thermal regimes relative to constant thermal regimes.

However, another but poorly studied main characteristic of global change appears to be an increase in temperature variability. Most of the current analyses of global change have focused on mean values, paying less attention to the role of the fluctuations of environmental variables. We experimentally tested the effects of environmental temperature variability on characteristics associated to the fitness (body mass balance, growth rate, and survival), metabolic rate (VCO2) and molecular traits (heat shock protein expression, Hsp70), in an ectotherm, the terrestrial woodlouse Porcellio laevis. Our general hypotheses are that higher values of thermal amplitude may directly affect life-history traits, increasing metabolic cost and stress responses. At first, results supported our hypotheses showing a diversity of responses among characters to the experimental thermal treatments. We emphasize that knowledge about the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which animals cope with environmental changes is essential to understand the impact of mean climatic change and variability. Also, we consider that the studies that only incorporate only mean temperatures to predict the life-history, ecological and evolutionary impact of global temperature changes present important problems to predict the diversity of responses of the organism. This is because the analysis ignores the complexity and details of the molecular and physiological processes by which animals cope with environmental variability, as well as the life-history and demographic consequences of such variability.

Metabolic sensitivity to environmental temperature change increases in positive exponential relation with initial acclimated rates of energy expenditure, and is influenced by the relative rate with which intracellular amino acids are being mobilised by protein turnover. 2. Greater metabolic sensitivity results in greater physiological variability with fluctuating temperatures, higher energy costs incurred during the response to temperature change, and reduced viability upon exposure to extreme high temperatures. 3.

However, these systems would be subject to fluctuations in temperature (among other environmental factors), which can have dramatic effects on the growth rates of algal species and impact the overall productivity and quality of targeted algal crops. This study sought to elucidate the effects of temperature on algal growth rates, biomass accumulation, fatty acid production and composition. We surveyed 26 algal species from 5 different functional groups, growing them at 6 different temperatures between 9 and 32 degrees C. For each surveyed species, we collected eco-physiological trait data including maximum growth rate, thermal optimum (T-opt), thermal niche width, and lower and upper temperature limits for growth (CTmin and CTmax respectively); these data were also pooled for analysis at the functional group level. Responses to temperature varied among species, but at the functional group level we determined that the cyanobacteria have the highest thermal optimum (30.6 +/- 2.3 degrees C), followed by chlorophytes (25.7 +/- 0.1 degrees C) and diatoms (24.0 +/- 0.4 degrees C). Temperature-specific fatty acid (FA) production was mostly controlled by growth rates, though some change in production was attributable to modification of intracellular FA stores. Temperature affected FA profiles in diverse ways, with no consistent trends across species or functional groups. In sum, temperature significantly impacts the overall productivity of algal biofuel systems by influencing species growth rates and fatty acid production. While algal growth rates varied predictably with temperature, we did not find the generalizable trends in temperature dependence of FA composition, suggesting that some aspects of algal cultivation for bioproducts in outdoor, open-air systems may be less predictable. However, a compilation of algal growth and FA composition responses to temperature, such as ours, may be useful for choosing appropriate species for given temperature regimes.","[Nalley, Jakob O.; O'Donnell, Daniel R.; Litchman, Elena] Michigan State Univ, Kellogg Biol Stn, Hickory Corners, MI 49060 USA; [Nalley, Jakob O.; O'Donnell, Daniel R.; Litchman, Elena] Michigan State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Nalley, Jakob O.; O'Donnell, Daniel R.; Litchman, Elena] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Michigan State University","Nalley, JO (corresponding author), 2817 Haynes Dr, Midland, TX 79705 USA.","nalleyja@msu.edu","ODonnell, Daniel/GXG-8072-2022","Litchman, Elena/0000-0001-7736-6332","National Science Foundation [CBET 11-34215]; NSF [GK-12]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was in part supported by the National Science Foundation grant CBET 11-34215 to EL and C.A.

This is now even more important because human-induced climate change is predicted to affect both the mean and variability of the thermal environment. Although environmental change occurs ubiquitously, relatively few researchers have studied the effects of fluctuating environments on the performance of developing organisms. Even fewer have tried to validate a framework for predicting performance in fluctuating environments. Here, we determined whether reaction norms based on performance at constant temperatures (18, 22, 26, 30 and 34 degrees C) could be used to predict embryonic and larval performance of anurans at fluctuating temperatures (18-28 degrees C and 18-34C). Based on existing theory, we generated hypotheses about the effects of stress and acclimation on the predictability of performance in variable environments. Our empirical models poorly predicted the performance of striped marsh frogs (Limnodynastes peronii) at fluctuating temperatures, suggesting that extrapolation from studies conducted under artificial thermal conditions would lead to erroneous conclusions. During the majority of ontogenetic stages, growth and development in variable environments proceeded more rapidly than expected, suggesting that acute exposures to extreme temperatures enable greater performance than do chronic exposures. Consistent with theory, we predicted performance more accurately for the less variable thermal environment. Our results underscore the need to measure physiological performance under naturalistic thermal conditions when testing hypotheses about thermal plasticity or when parameterizing models of life-history evolution.","[Niehaus, Amanda C.; Franklin, Craig E.; Wilson, Robbie S.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4068, Australia; [Angilletta, Michael J., Jr.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Sears, Michael W.] Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Biol, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA","University of Queensland; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Bryn Mawr College","Wilson, RS (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4068, Australia.","r.wilson@uq.edu.au","Franklin, Craig/G-7343-2012","Franklin, Craig/0000-0003-1315-3797; Wilson, Robbie/0000-0002-0116-5427","Ecological Society of Australia; International Postgraduate Research Scholarship; UQ Graduate School; Australian Research Council (ARC)","Ecological Society of Australia; International Postgraduate Research Scholarship(Australian Government); UQ Graduate School; Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council)","A.C.N. was supported by a student research grant from the Ecological Society of Australia, an International Postgraduate Research Scholarship and a UQ Graduate School Scholarship.

In the Gulf of California (Mexico), Lithophyllum margaritae (Rhodophyta, Corallinaceae) is the most abundant nongeniculate, rhodolith-forming coralline species. Over their gulf-wide distribution, rhodoliths are exposed to a wide range of seasonal temperatures (similar to 8-32 degrees C). The effect of changes in temperature on the photosynthetic and calcification rates of this species is unknown. We therefore evaluated the effect of temperature (10-30 degrees C) on the photosynthetic and calcification rates of L. margaritae rhodoliths in the lab and examined the effect of seasonal changes in temperature on growth rates in the field. Photosynthetic rates were evaluated polarographically and calcification rates were evaluated in the lab using both the buoyant weight technique and total alkalinity method, and in the field through alizarin staining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that these three methods are used simultaneously to evaluate growth rates in coralline algae. Photosynthetic, calcification and growth rates showed wide fluctuations as a result of laboratory or field temperature. Photosynthetic (P-max) and respiratory rates both increased five-fold as incubation temperature increased to 25-30 degrees C. Similarly, calcification rates in the lab and growth rates in the field increased with higher temperatures. The lab data suggest that rhodolith growth is seasonally regulated by seawater temperature. The buoyant weight and total alkalinity techniques for determining calcification rate were comparable at low temperatures, but variability increased with temperature and this will be examined in further studies. Field growth rates, presented as apical tip extension, were significantly higher in summer (5.02 +/- 1.16 mm yr(-1)) than in winter (0.83 +/- 0.16 mm yr(-1)), supporting the lab results. The strong effects of temperature on photosynthetic, calcification and growth rates of Lithophyllum margaritae in the Gulf of California suggest that changes in sea surface temperature directly regulate bed production.","[Steller, D.

Fluctuating temperatures affected all parameters measured, suggesting that rate measurements at constant temperatures are not necessarily appropriate for modelling of processes in naturally fluctuating environments. Although there were significant effects of fluctuating temperature on parameter estimates, no universal trend was observed. Furthermore, effects under fluctuating conditions could not be predicted from mean estimates of measurements made over the temperature ranges.

We extended the light-sensitive virtual plant model L-Cucumber by implementing a common Arrhenius function for appearance rates, growth rates, and growth durations. For two greenhouse experiments, the temperature sensitive model approach resulted in a precise prediction of cucumber mean internode lengths and number of internodes, as well as in accurately predicted patterns of individual internode lengths along the main stem. In addition, a system's analysis revealed that environmental data averaged over the experimental period were not necessarily related to internode performance.

In this work, the green algae Neochloris oleoabundans and Scenedesmus dimorphus were grown in tightly-controlled turbidostat-based photobioreactors to determine the potential benefits of temperature control for biomass production of these organisms versus allowing these cultures to experience temperature fluctuations similar to what would be found in uncontrolled, outdoor open ponds or closed bioreactors.

The model allows the flexibility to manipulate a host of variables associated with raceway-design, algal-growth, water-quality, hydrodynamic, and atmospheric conditions. The model provides realistic results wherein growth rates follow the diurnal fluctuation of solar irradiation and temperature. The greatest benefit that numerical simulation of the flow system offers is the ability to design the raceway before construction, saving considerable cost and time.

An organism's environment, particularly early in development, can profoundly shape its future phenotypes. While the long-term consequences of embryonic temperature are well studied in vertebrates, insects have complex life cycles that may uncouple temperature's effects in one stage from physiology in the next. 2. This study examines how egg temperature affects insect performance across all subsequent life stages. We focused on the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, and examined how egg temperatures affected hatching time, hatchling mass, larval growth, development time, head capsule size, pupal mass and adult fecundity. Eggs were exposed to either diurnal temperature cycles or a single heat shock; in both experiments, temperatures were within the range to which eggs are typically exposed in the field. 3. Although the consequences of egg temperature varied depending on the type of treatment, both cycling temperatures and heat shock affected egg development time and initial larval growth rate, which likely have fitness consequences for M. sexta in nature. In contrast, egg temperature had no persistent effect on any trait measured in later larval stages, pupae or adults. 4. Organisms with complex life cycles -Manduca has four distinct life stages and multiple larval sub-stages - may benefit from rapid compensation for poor early conditions. Additionally, the modularity of insect life cycles may help insects cope with environmental variability by insulating later stages from disturbances during embryogenesis.","[Potter, Kristen A.; Woods, H.

We examined the effects of water temperature and food resource gradients on the growth rate of zooplankton undergoing vertical migration in Lake Michigan. In three laboratory experiments, juvenile Daphnia mendotae, native herbivorous cladocerans, were incubated for 5 days at water temperatures associated with the epilimnion and deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) of Lake Michigan and were fed food resources collected directly from these regions. Growth rate strongly depended on water temperature, as Daphnia incubated at the epilimnetic temperature (21 degrees C) grew 42% faster than those at the DCM temperature (8 degrees C). Growth rate of Daphnia that alternated between the two temperatures every 12 h (0.108 day(-1)) was similar to the arithmetic average growth rate of the two water temperature treatment extremes (0.110 day(-1)), suggesting fluctuating temperatures alone do not substantially influence Daphnia growth. In contrast, food resources derived from different depths did not affect growth rate, nor was there a significant interaction between food resource origin and water temperature effects. Our results indicate that vertical migration will reduce growth rate, and hence zooplankton production, through reduced temperature, not from changes in resources. Consideration of the effects of vertical migration, especially given the known variability in this behavior, may substantially improve zooplankton production estimates in the Great Lakes.

For ectotherms, in particular, temperature has a strong influence on habitat choice. While well studied at the species level, less is known about factors affecting the preferred temperature of individuals; especially lacking is information on how physiological traits are linked to thermal preference and whether such relationships are affected by factors such feeding history and growth trajectory. This study examined these issues in the common minnow Phoxinus phoxinus, to determine the extent to which feeding history, standard metabolic rate (SMR) and aerobic scope (AS), interact to affect temperature preference. Individuals were either: 1) food deprived (FD) for 21days, then fed ad libitum for the next 74days; or 2) fed ad libitum throughout the entire period. All animals were then allowed to select preferred temperatures using a shuttle-box, and then measured for SMR and AS at 10 degrees C, estimated by rates of oxygen uptake. Activity within the shuttle-box under a constant temperature regime was also measured. In both FD and control fish, SMR was negatively correlated with preferred temperature. The SMR of the FD fish was increased compared with the controls, probably due to the effects of compensatory growth, and so these growth-compensated fish preferred temperatures that were on average 285 degrees C cooler than controls fed a maintenance ration throughout the study. Fish experiencing compensatory growth also displayed a large reduction in activity. In growth-compensated fish and controls, activity measured at 10 degrees C was positively correlated with preferred temperature. Individual fish prefer temperatures that vary predictably with SMR and activity level, which are both plastic in response to feeding history and growth trajectories. Cooler temperatures probably allow individuals to reduce maintenance costs and divert more energy towards growth. A reduction in SMR at cooler temperatures, coupled with a decrease in spontaneous activity, could also allow individuals to increase surplus AS for coping with environmental stressors. In warming climates, however, aquatic ectotherms could experience frequent fluctuations in food supply with long-lasting effects on metabolic rate due to compensatory growth, while simultaneously having limited access to preferred cooler habitats.","Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland","University of Glasgow","Killen, SS (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Graham Kerr Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.","shaun.killen@glasgow.ac.uk","","Killen, Shaun/0000-0003-4949-3988","UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC); NERC [NE/G013896/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [NE/G013896/1] Funding Source: researchfish","UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This study was funded by a UK Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) research fellowship.

Using a globally important model species, the blue mussel Mytilus, in a 5-week-long experiment, we (a) assessed growth performance traits under 12 scenarios, consisting of four thermal averages (18.5, 21, 23.5 and 26celcius) imposed as constant or daily fluctuating regimes with amplitudes of 2 or 4celcius. Additionally, we conducted a short-term assay using different mussel individuals to (b) test for the species capacity for suppression and recovery of metabolic performance traits (feeding and aerobic respiration) when exposed to a 1-day thermal fluctuation regime (16.8-30.5celcius). Using this high-resolution data, we (c) generated short-term thermal metabolic performance curves to predict and explain growth responses observed in the long-term experiment. We found that daily high-amplitude thermal cycles (4celcius) improved mussel growth when fluctuations were imposed around an extreme average temperature of 26celcius, representing end-of-century heatwaves. In contrast, thermal cycles negatively affected mussel growth at a less extreme average temperature of 23.5celcius, resembling current peak summer temperature scenarios. These results suggest that fluctuations ameliorate heat stress impacts only at critically high average temperatures. The short-term assay demonstrated that during the warming phase, animals stopped feeding between 24 and 30celcius while gradually suppressing respiration. In the subsequent cooling phase, feeding and respiration partially and fully recovered to pre-heating rates respectively. Furthermore, nonlinear averaging of short-term feeding responses (upscaling) well-predicted longer term growth responses to fluctuations. Our findings suggest that fluctuations can be beneficial to or detrimental for the long-term performance of ectothermic animals, depending on the fluctuations' average and amplitude. Furthermore, the observed effects can be linked to fluctuation-mediated metabolic suppression and recovery. In a general framework, we propose various hypothetical scenarios of fluctuation impacts on ectotherm performance considering inter- or intra-species variability in heat sensitivity. Our research highlights the need for studying metabolic performance in relation to cyclic abiotic fluctuations to advance the understanding of climate change impacts on aquatic systems.

Sources of experimental errors are many and are not always adequately controlled. For statistical analysis, the more common problems include the assumption of a linear relationship between temperature and development rate over the whole temperature range and extrapolation or subjective vertical cutoff of the rate function in rate summation for varying temperatures. Development-time data of 26 species were selected for the analysis. For each species, the expected development time under each varying temperature regime was estimated by integrating constant temperature development rates over the 24-h varying temperature cycle. These estimates were then compared with the development times observed under the corresponding varying temperature regimes, and the significance of the differences was evaluated. The results as a whole suggest that the differences in development times between constant and varying temperatures could usually be accounted for by the effect of rate summation based on the curvilinear relationship between temperature and rate of development. The possible physiological mechanisms that act in addition to the rate-summation effect are briefly discussed. Finally, the need for more extensive and detailed investigations in this area of study is indicated.","","","LIU, SS (corresponding author), ZHEJIANG AGR UNIV, DEPT AGRON, HANGZHOU 310029, PEOPLES R CHINA.","","Zhu, Jun/B-9945-2009; Liu, Shu-Sheng/D-2300-2013","","","","",NA,"57","124","136","2","61","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","0013-8746","1938-2901","","ANN ENTOMOL SOC AM","Ann.

Recent studies suggest influences of temperature and growth rates on B/Ca, the effect of which could be critical for the reconstructions of surface ocean pH and atmospheric pCO(2). In this paper, we present the first laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses of Mg, Sr, Li, and B in the coralline alga Lithothamnion corallioides collected from different geographic settings and depths across the Mediterranean Sea and in the Atlantic Ocean. We produced the first data on putative temperature proxies (Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, Sr/Ca, Mg/Li) and B/Ca in a coralline algal species grown in different basins from across the photic zone (12, 40, 45, and 66 m depth). We tested the B/Ca correlation with temperature proxies and growth rates in order to evaluate their possible effect on B incorporation. Our results suggested a growth rate influence on B/Ca, which was evident in the sample with the lowest growth rate of 0.10 mm yr(-1) (Pontian Isl., Italy; 66 m depth) and in Elba (Italy; 45 m depth), where the algal growth rate was the highest (0.14 mm yr(-1)). At these two sites, the measured B/Ca was the lowest at 462.8 +/- 49.2 mu mol mol(-1) and the highest at 757.7 +/- 75.5 mu mol mol(-1), respectively. A positive correlation between B/Ca and temperature proxies was found only in the shallowest sample from Morlaix (Atlantic coast of France; 12 m depth), where the amplitude of temperature variation (Delta T) was the highest (8.9 degrees C). Still, fluctuations in B/Ca did not mirror yearly seasonal temperature oscillations as for Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, and Sr/Ca. We concluded that growth rates, triggered by the different Delta T and light availability across depth, affect the B incorporation in L. corallioides.","[Piazza, Giulia; Bracchi, Valentina A.; Basso, Daniela] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, CoNISMa Res Unit Milano Bicocca, Piazza Sci 4, I-20126 Milan, Italy; [Piazza, Giulia] Univ Barcelona, Dept Earth & Ocean Dynam, Marti i Franques S-N, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Langone, Antonio] CNR, Inst Geosci & Earth Resources, Via Ferrata 1, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Meroni, Agostino N.] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy","University of Milano-Bicocca; University of Barcelona; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Geoscienze e Georisorse (IGG-CNR); Polytechnic University of Milan","Piazza, G (corresponding author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, CoNISMa Res Unit Milano Bicocca, Piazza Sci 4, I-20126 Milan, Italy.;Piazza, G (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Earth & Ocean Dynam, Marti i Franques S-N, Barcelona 08028, Spain.","g.piazza15@campus.unimib.it","MERONI, AGOSTINO NIYONKURU/GWM-6177-2022; Piazza, Giulia/GLT-0261-2022; Langone, Antonio/HLQ-1346-2023; MERONI, AGOSTINO NIYONKURU/ABA-3544-2020; Basso, Daniela/B-7693-2013","MERONI, AGOSTINO NIYONKURU/0000-0001-5504-632X; Piazza, Giulia/0000-0002-5671-8818; Langone, Antonio/0000-0002-7346-2922; MERONI, AGOSTINO NIYONKURU/0000-0001-5504-632X; Basso, Daniela/0000-0002-9352-3569; BRACCHI, VALENTINA ALICE/0000-0001-9918-7079","University of Milano-Bicocca","University of Milano-Bicocca","We are grateful to the anonymous referees whose comments enabled us to significantly improve the paper.

Collections were restricted to the bottom 20 cm of the ice sheet in an area with little or no snow (0-5 cm). At low temperature and irradiance these algae normally exhibited low assimilation numbers (ca. 0.1-0.4 mg C.mg Chl-1.h-1). Average growth rates (0.02-0.45 d-1), based on changes in standing stocks, were also low. Biomass, biochemical composition, growth rates, assimilation numbers and photosynthetic efficiencies (mg C.mg Chl-1.h-1 (mu-E.m-2.s-1)-1) displayed large fluctuations over periods of several days during the growth season. On the other hand, I(k), which is an index of photoadaptation, and I(m), the optimal irradiance for photosynthesis, were relatively constant with less than twofold variation throughout our study. Substantial nutrient fluxes (3.3-8.0 mmol Si or N.m-2.d-1) were necessary to satisfy the minimum nutrient demand for the observed biomass levels and population growth rates; over the 41 days of our study, integrated nutrient demand represented 69-150 mmol N or Si.m-2. Only 5-25% of this total demand could be met by all of the nutrients in the ice sheet, if they were readily available. However, adequate amounts were present in the top few meters of the water column. With small nutrient gradients in surface waters below the sea ice, vertical eddy diffusivities on the order of 3.8-9.3 cm2.s-1 should supply sufficient nutrients to meet algal demand.","UNIV SO CALIF,DEPT BIOL SCI,MARINE BIOL RES SECT,LOS ANGELES,CA 90089","University of Southern California","","","","","","","",NA,"53","66","68","0","12","PHYCOLOGICAL SOC AMER INC","LAWRENCE","810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044","0022-3646","","","J PHYCOL","J.

It is usually exposed to high fluctuations of light intensity, light quality, temperature, and desiccation, all of which affect the temporal and spatial distribution as well as the morphology and the metabolism of this alga. In laboratory experiments we examined the effects of different light intensities (50, 100, and 200 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) on photosynthesis, calcification, photosynthetic pigment contents (chlorophyll a and carotenoids), and growth rate of C. officinalis to clarify its photoacclimation strategies. Net photosynthesis, calcification and dissolution rates based on weight were not sensitive to irradiance. Although, photosynthesis and calcification did not clearly respond to light intensity, photosynthetic pigment contents were significantly lower at higher light intensities. In addition, higher irradiances induced significant enhancement of gross photosynthesis based on chlorophyll a. As a result, the specific growth rate was significantly stimulated by high light intensity. Our results suggest that photo acclimation of C. officinalis to different light conditions may be regulated to optimize growth.","[Kim, Ju-Hyoung; Lam, Sao Mai N.; Kim, Kwang Young] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kwangju 500757, South Korea","Chonnam National University","Kim, KY (corresponding author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Oceanog, Kwangju 500757, South Korea.","kykim@chonnam.ac.kr","Kim, Ju-Hyoung/S-6240-2019; Kim, Ju-Hyoung/N-1450-2019","Kim, Ju-Hyoung/0000-0002-8908-0902","Chonnam National University","Chonnam National University","This study was financially supported by Chonnam National University, 2012.",NA,"39","16","17","5","59","KOREAN SOC PHYCOLOGY","SEOUL","B1F, TRUST TOWER, 275-7 YANGJAE-DONG, SEOCHO-KU, SEOUL, 137-739, SOUTH KOREA","1226-2617","2093-0860","","ALGAE-SEOUL","Algae","DEC","2013","28","4","",NA,"",NA,"355","363","","10.4490/algae.2013.28.4.355","http://dx.doi.org/10.4490/algae.2013.28.4.355","","","9","Plant Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology","AL0FD",NA,"Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000338801900005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, recent research suggests the relationship between nutrition, temperature, host plant quality and life history traits that influence insect fitness are more complex than appreciated to date. In the laboratory, rates of development are most strongly influenced by temperature, while growth, body composition, and reproductive output are greatly affected by nutrition, notably the uptake of protein and carbohydrate. However, individual outcomes and consequently population responses in the field are not readily predicted from data on ambient temperatures and host plant chemical composition. The relative amounts of protein and carbohydrate gained from a host plant depends on complex interactions between plant cell structure and leaf chemistry, combined with plasticity in feeding behaviour, microclimate selection, digestive and assimilative physiology. For example, grasshoppers can exploit the temperature dependence of host plant quality to maintain nutritional homeostasis. Consequently, understanding environmental interactions such as leaf defences and patterns of foraging, and predicting the effects of climate change on insect populations, will be complex.","[Clissold, Fiona J.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","University of Sydney; University of Sydney","Clissold, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.","fiona.clissold@sydney.edu.au","","Simpson, Stephen J./0000-0003-0256-7687","Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship","Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship(Australian Research Council)","SJS was supported by an Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowship.",NA,"56","56","57","2","82","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","2214-5745","2214-5753","","CURR OPIN INSECT SCI","Curr.

This often obscures the effects of developmental trends or of other environmental conditions when temperature fluctuates naturally. A method is proposed for modelling temperature-compensated rates, based on the coordination of temperature responses of developmental processes. In a data set comprising 41 experiments in the greenhouse, growth chamber, or the field, the temperature responses in the range of 6-36 degrees C for different processes were compared in three species, maize, rice, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Germination, cell division, expansive growth rate, leaf initiation, and phenology showed coordinated temperature responses and followed common laws within each species. The activities of 10 enzymes involved in carbon metabolism exhibited monotonous exponential responses across the whole range 10-40 degrees C. Hence, the temperature dependence of developmental processes is not explained by a simple relationship to central metabolism. Temperature-compensated rates of development were calculated from the equations of response curve, by expressing rates per unit equivalent time at 20 degrees C. This resulted in stable rates when temperatures fluctuated over a large range (for which classical thermal time was inefficient), and in time courses of leaf development which were common to several experiments with different temperature scenarios.","[Parent, B.; Turc, O.; Tardieu, F.] INRA, Lab Ecophysiol Plantes Stress Environm UMR759, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Gibon, Y.; Stitt, M.] Max Planck Inst Mol Plant Physiol, D-14476 Golm, Germany; [Gibon, Y.] INRA, Biol Fruit UMR619, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France","INRAE; Max Planck Society; INRAE","Tardieu, F (corresponding author), INRA, Lab Ecophysiol Plantes Stress Environm UMR759, Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France.","tardieu@supagro.inra.fr","Stitt, Mark/GVT-1242-2022; Gibon, Yves/B-9919-2011; Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012","Gibon, Yves/0000-0001-8161-1089; Turc, Olivier/0000-0003-0659-1406; Tardieu, Francois/0000-0002-7287-0094; Stitt, Mark/0000-0002-4900-1763","Generation Challenge Programme","Generation Challenge Programme","We thank B Moulia, G Hammer, H Poorter, and T Sharkey for useful comments on the manuscript.

Therefore, numerical three-dimensional fatigue crack growth simulations for different power plant components have been performed using FRANC3D taking temperature transients and pressure loads as well as different relevant crack positions into account. The results show that the temperature gradient of thermal loadings has a large influence on stress intensity factors (SIF) and may lead to much higher SIF than under pure mechanical loading. In order to quantify the residual lifetime, temperature-dependent fatigue crack growth curves for different stress ratios were experimentally determined. Therefore, experiments with constant temperatures between room temperature and 600 degrees C have been performed using C(T)-specimens cut of a decommissioned high-pressure bypass station made of the ferritic-martensitic steel X20CrMoV12-1.

The rates of leaf expansion and of cell division were analysed in leaves located at two positions on the stem, and a spatial analysis of expansion rate was carried out. Experiments were performed in growth chamber (stable conditions), in the field or in a greenhouse (fluctuating conditions). We compared three methods for characterizing the rate and the duration of expansion, Responses to leaf temperature were consistent only when expansion was characterized as a two-phase process - a period of exponential expansion (constant relative expansion rate, RER) followed by a decrease in RER, RER and relative cell division rate (RDR) responded linearly to temperature with a common response curve for all studied conditions. This response curve was also common to all studied zones within a leaf and to leaves at two positions on the stem. The reciprocals of the durations of the periods of exponential expansion, non-zero expansion and non-zero division were also linearly related to leaf temperature with common response curves in a given leaf zone, The x-intercepts of all these response curves and of the response curve of leaf initiation rate to temperature did not significantly differ in an analysis of covariance, with a common value of 4.8 degrees C. The expression of time in cumulative degree days, with a base temperature of 4.8 degrees C, resulted in a unique time course of RER and cell division rate regardless of temperature.

Plant distributions and growth rates are limited by high and low temperature extremes near the edges of their temperature range and also by the average temperatures experienced. The range of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations is also an important determinant of growth range. Differences in responses of respiration rates to temperature fluctuations play a major role in determining differences in growth rates among individual plants within an allowed growth range. Temperature coefficients of respiration rate differ among species and among individual plants within a species. Plants from high latitude and high elevation sites have smaller dependencies of metabolic rates on temperature than plants from low latitude, low elevation sites. Temperature coefficients are heritable characteristics, not simply a consequence of acclimation. Not all metabolic processes have the same temperature dependence, even within a single plant. For example, the temperature dependence of the CO2 production rate mu(CO2) in most plants differs from the temperature dependence of metabolic heat rate mu(q). For different plants, q may be greater than, equal to, or smaller than mu(CO2). Changing ratios of q/R(CO2) indicate changing efficiency with temperature and therefore with climate. Our measures of the temperature dependence of respiration parameters combined with a thermodynamically based model of plant growth now provides physiological explanations for the biogeographical distributions of plants. Values of q are related to the range of climates habitable by a species and can be used along with other parameters to select plants best suited for growth within a given environment.","THERMALYT INC,DAVIS,CA 95616; BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIV,DEPT BOT & RANGE SCI,PROVO,UT 84602; BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIV,DEPT CHEM & BIOCHEM,PROVO,UT 84602","Brigham Young University; Brigham Young University","Criddle, RS (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF DAVIS,SECT MOL & CELLULAR BIOL,DAVIS,CA 95616, USA.","","","","","","",NA,"16","8","8","1","12","MAIK NAUKA/INTERPERIODICA","NEW YORK","C/O PLENUM/CONSULTANTS BUREAU 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013","1021-4437","","","RUSS J PLANT PHYSL+","Russ.

As ectothermic organisms, both parasitoid and host are strongly impacted by environmental temperature. If thermal tolerances differ between host insect and parasitoid, then the outcome of their interaction will be determined by the ambient temperature. As mean temperatures continue to rise and extreme temperatures become more frequent, we must determine the effect of high temperature stress on host-parasitoid systems to predict how they will fare in the face of climate change. The majority of studies conducted on host-parasitoid systems focus on either performance under constant temperature or a fixed metric of thermal tolerance (CTmax) for individual organisms. However, performance at constant temperatures is not predictive of performance under ecologically relevant, fluctuating temperatures and measurements of thermal thresholds provide little information regarding the effects of temperature throughout development. We address this by testing the effects of increasing mean temperature in both constant and fluctuating (+/- 10 degrees C) environments throughout development on the performance of the parasitoid wasp Cotesia congregata and its lepidopteran larval host, Manduca sexta. The growth of M. sexta was influenced by mean temperature, diurnal fluctuations and parasitization status. Caterpillar growth rate increased with increasing mean temperature, but decreased in response to diurnal fluctuations and parasitization by C. congregata wasps. Wasp survival decreased with increasing mean temperature and with diurnal fluctuations. The effect of diurnal fluctuations was stronger at higher mean temperatures. Diurnal fluctuations at our highest mean temperature treatment (30 +/- 10 degrees C) resulted in complete wasp mortality, and parasitized hosts displayed abnormal physiology, wherein they failed to exhibit wasp emergence, did not enter the prepupal stage, continued to feed and grew up to twofold larger than a normal, unparasitized caterpillar. Our results indicate hosts and parasitoids in this system have different thermal tolerances during development; the parasitoid wasp suffered complete mortality at a temperature regime that is mildly stressful for the unparasitized caterpillar host species. Our findings suggest C. congregata will suffer more severely under increasing temperatures than M. sexta, with cascading trophic and ecological effects.","[Moore, M.

Ectotherm performance can be maintained in thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed to either stable (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C) or variable (narrowly variable: 13-17 degrees C day(-1) or widely variable 11-21 degrees C day(-1)) thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 +/- 0.5 degrees C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, % body mass gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed, U-crit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments, suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a plastic response in swimming performance, where U-crit was insensitive to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal breadth. Maximum U-crit attained was similar among thermoperiod treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures (stable: 4.62 +/- 0.44 BL s(-1) at 15 degrees C; narrowly variable: 4.52 +/- 0.23 BL s(-1) at 21 degrees C; widely variable: 3.90 +/- 0.24 BL s(-1) at 11 degrees C, mean +/- s.e.m.).

Lately, there has been interest in using the intrinsic growth rate (rm) to predict the effects of climate warming on ectotherm population viability. However, because rm is calculated using the Euler-Lotka equation, its reliability in predicting population persistence depends on whether ectotherm populations can achieve a stable age/stage distribution in thermally variable environments. Here, we investigate this issue using a mathematical framework that incorporates mechanistic descriptions of temperature effects on vital rates into a stage-structured population model that realistically captures the temperature-induced variability in developmental delays that characterize ectotherm life cycles. We find that populations experiencing seasonal temperature variation converge to a stage distribution whose intra-annual pattern remains invariant across years. As a result, the mean annual per capita growth rate also remains constant between years. The key insight is the mechanism that allows populations converge to a stationary stage distribution. Temperature effects on the biochemical processes (e.g. enzyme kinetics, hormonal regulation) that underlie life-history traits (reproduction, development and mortality) exhibit well-defined thermodynamical properties (e.g. changes in entropy and enthalpy) that lead to predictable outcomes (e.g. reduction in reaction rates or hormonal action at temperature extremes). As a result, life-history traits exhibit a systematic and predictable response to seasonal temperature variation. This in turn leads to temporally predictable temperature responses of the stage distribution and the per capita growth rate. When climate warming causes an increase in the mean annual temperature and/or the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations, the population model predicts the mean annual per capita growth rate to decline to zero within 100 years when warming is slow relative to the developmental period of the organism (003-005 degrees C per year) and to become negative, causing population extinction, well before 100 years when warming is fast (e.g. 01 degrees C per year). The Euler-Lotka equation predicts a slower decrease in rm when warming is slow and a longer persistence time when warming is fast, with the deviation between the two metrics increasing with increasing developmental period. These results suggest that predictions of ectotherm population viability based on rm may be valid only for species with short developmental delays, and even then, only over short time-scales and under slow warming regimes.","[Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Coutinho, Renato M.] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Fis Teor, BR-01140070 Sao Paulo, Brazil","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Universidade Estadual Paulista","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 621 Charles E Young Dr South, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","amarasek@ucla.edu","Coutinho, Renato M/H-9133-2017","Coutinho, Renato M/0000-0002-2828-8558","James S.

However, thermal time is often seen as a loose concept because of a multitude of thermal functions and case-specific parameter values. Our hypothesis is that these different formalisms and parameterization could emerge from common principles and a common response of plant development to temperature, but with several counfounding factors which are not taken into account. We first show that these calculations of thermal time are based on sound common principles and mathematical formalisms. We test, via a modelling exercise of nine case studies using maize plants grown in three field sites, how a given ground truth response of plant development rate to temperature can be affected if an experimenter either considers or ignores confounding factors. We also show that apparent differences in temperature responses between phenological stages of the growth cycle, between day and night, or between plant genotypes may be due to the confounding effects of evaporative demand, the range of temperatures, and the time interval at which measurements are taken. On the basis of our findings, we propose that the critical point in the use of a given formalism of thermal time calculation is to ensure that the chosen model is compatible with the temporal definition, temperature range, and environmental scenario in the considered dataset.","[Parent, Boris; Millet, Emilie J.; Tardieu, Francois] Univ Montpellier, LEPSE, INRA, Montpellier SupAgro, F-34060 Montpellier, France","INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier","Parent, B (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, LEPSE, INRA, Montpellier SupAgro, F-34060 Montpellier, France.","boris.parent@inra.ir","","Millet, Emilie/0000-0002-2913-4892","European project DROPS [FP7-244374]; European project MODEXTREME [FP7-613817]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche projects [ANR-10-BTBR-01, ANR-11-INBS-0012]; ERANET + project MODCARBOSTRESS within the Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE-JPI) [618105]","European project DROPS; European project MODEXTREME; Agence Nationale de la Recherche projects(French National Research Agency (ANR)); ERANET + project MODCARBOSTRESS within the Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE-JPI)","This work was supported by the European projects DROPS (FP7-244374) and MODEXTREME (FP7-613817), and by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche projects ANR-10-BTBR-01 (Amaizing) and ANR-11-INBS-0012 (Phenome) and through the ERANET + project MODCARBOSTRESS within the Joint Programming Initiative on Agriculture, Food Security and Climate Change (FACCE-JPI, grant agreement no. 618105).",NA,"58","13","13","3","22","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0022-0957","1460-2431","","J EXP BOT","J.

Three common species of freshwater phytoplankton, the diatom Nitzschia sp., green alga Sphaerocystis schroeteri and cyanobacterium Phormidium luridum, were grown under contrasting daylengths [18 : 6 h light : dark cycles (LD) versus 6 : 18 h LD] and phosphorus (P) regimes (P-sufficient versus 1 mum P). The rates of growth and photosynthesis, as well as growth efficiencies and pigment concentrations, were compared among treatments. 2. The growth and photosynthetic parameters of the three species depended on both P status and daylength in a species-specific way. The responses to P limitation depended on daylength and, conversely, the responses to daylength depended on P status. 3. Growth rates and the maximum rates of photosynthesis (P-max) of all species decreased under P limitation under both light regimes. However, the decrease of P-max because of P limitation was greater under long daylength. The P-max of the green alga S. schroeteri decreased the most (ca. sixfold) under P limitation compared with the other two species. The photosynthesis saturation parameter I-k also decreased under P limitation; the decline was significant in Nitzschia and Sphaerocystis. P-limitation significantly increased photoinhibition (beta) in Nitzschia and Sphaerocystis, but not in Phormidium. The excess photochemical capacity (the ratio of the maximum photosynthesis rate to the photosynthesis rate at the growth irradiance), characterising the ability to utilise fluctuating light, was significantly lower under P limitation. 4. The growth efficiency (growth rate normalised to daylength) declined with increasing daylength in all species. Under short daylength the cyanobacterium Phormidium had the lowest growth efficiency of the three species. 5. The cellular chlorophyll a concentration in both Nitzschia and Sphaerocystis was significantly higher under short daylength, but only under P-sufficient conditions. In Nitzschia, under short daylength, P-limitation significantly decreased cellular chlorophyll concentration. In contrast, P-limitation increased cellular chlorophyll concentration in Sphaerocystis, but under long daylength only. The ratio of chlorophyll a to b in the green alga also declined under short daylength and under P-limited conditions.","EAWAG, Limnol Res Ctr, Kastanienbaum, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG)","Litchman, E (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Biol, 310 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.","","","Litchman, Elena/0000-0001-7736-6332","","","",NA,"26","74","75","7","59","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","OXFORD","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND","0046-5070","","","FRESHWATER BIOL","Freshw.

Analysis of the simultaneous effects of temperature and alleochemicals is also necessary because these factors may interact. We examined the effects of three allelochemicals found in tomato (chlorogenic acid, rutin and tomatine) and thermal regime (21:10 degrees C and 26:15 degrees C, representing spring and summer respectively) on five insect herbivores (a Solanaceae specialist, Manduca sex-tn, and the polyphagous Heliothis virescens, Pseudoplusia includens, Spodoptera frugiperda and Trichoplusia iii). There were allelochemical interactions and thermal regime-allelochemical interactions for all species, and so the patterns were complex. In some cases, paired allelochemicals or the combination of three allelochemicals showed adverse additive effects on insect performance. But that was not always the case, and there were only a few examples of synergism. Negative effects of the allelochemicals were sometimes, but not always, damped by the cooler thermal regime. Comparing the growth rates of the five species in this study with those of a previous study (a total of seven species) revealed five patterns. For two of three pairs of closely-related species, the paired species had distinctly different patterns. For example, for H. virescens, tomatine prevented development and chlorogenic acid slowed growth, whereas for Helicoverpa tea, tomatine just slowed growth and the phenolics had little effect. The specialist Manduca sexta had a pattern that was midway between patterns of the generalists; it was not the most tolerant of the allelochemicals.","SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton","Stamp, NE (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.","","Stamp, Nancy E/C-3806-2011","","","","",NA,"46","30","31","0","17","WILEY-BLACKWELL","MALDEN","COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA","0013-8703","","","ENTOMOL EXP APPL","Entomol.

A key aspect of an organism's thermal performance curve (TPC)-the relationship between fitness-related trait performance and temperature-is its thermal sensitivity, i.e., the rate at which trait values increase with temperature within its typically experienced thermal range. For a given trait, the distribution of thermal sensitivities across species, often quantified as activation energy values, is typically right-skewed. Currently, the mechanisms that generate this distribution are unclear, with considerable debate about the role of thermodynamic constraints versus adaptive evolution. Here, using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we study the evolution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate across phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae) and prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), 2 microbial groups that play a major role in the global carbon cycle. We find that thermal sensitivity across these groups is moderately phylogenetically heritable, and that its distribution is shaped by repeated evolutionary convergence throughout its parameter space. More precisely, we detect bursts of adaptive evolution in thermal sensitivity, increasing the amount of overlap among its distributions in different clades. We obtain qualitatively similar results from evolutionary analyses of the thermal sensitivities of 2 physiological rates underlying growth rate: net photosynthesis and respiration of plants. Furthermore, we find that these episodes of evolutionary convergence are consistent with 2 opposing forces: decrease in thermal sensitivity due to environmental fluctuations and increase due to adaptation to stable environments. Overall, our results indicate that adaptation can lead to large and relatively rapid shifts in thermal sensitivity, especially in microbes for which rapid evolution can occur at short timescales. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to elucidating the implications of rapid evolution in organismal thermal sensitivity for ecosystem functioning.","[Kontopoulos, Dimitrios-Georgios] Imperial Coll London, Sci & Solut Changing Planet DTP, London, England; [Kontopoulos, Dimitrios-Georgios; Smith, Thomas P.; Barraclough, Timothy G.; Pawar, Samraat] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, Ascot, Berks, England; [Barraclough, Timothy G.] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, Oxon, England","Imperial College London; Imperial College London; University of Oxford","Kontopoulos, DG (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Sci & Solut Changing Planet DTP, London, England.;Kontopoulos, DG (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk, Ascot, Berks, England.","dgkontopoulos@gmail.com","Kontopoulos, Dimitrios - Georgios/H-5822-2019; Smith, Tom/AAH-3263-2021","Kontopoulos, Dimitrios - Georgios/0000-0002-5082-1929; Smith, Tom/0000-0002-4038-9722; Barraclough, Timothy/0000-0002-8084-2640; Pawar, Samraat/0000-0001-8375-5684","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L002515/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) DTP scholarship [BB/J014575/1]; NERC [NE/M004740/1, NE/M020843/1]; NERC [NE/M020843/1, NE/M004740/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) DTP scholarship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","DGK was supported by a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) scholarship (NE/L002515/1; http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp? pcode=NE%2FL002515%2F1).

To investigate possible differences between sexes, thermal performance curves (WPCs) were established for female and male mysids based on ingestion rates measured at constant temperatures. TPCs of ingestion rates at constant temperatures differed between sexes, with female mysids showing a higher total ingestion rate as well as a higher thermal optimum compared to male mysids. Females showed reduced ingestion rates when exposed to fluctuating temperatures around their thermal optimum, whereas ingestion of male mysids was not reduced when exposed to fluctuating temperatures. The observed sex-specific differences might be related to potentially higher lipid and energy demands of the females.

Relative consumption rate (RCR) and relative growth rate (RGR) were significantly higher for larvae at the alternating thermal regime compared to those at the constant (representing the average) temperature. With increasing concentrations of rutin, the negative effect of rutin on RCR and RGR increased for the larvae in the alternating thermal regime; however, at the constant temperature, rutin had little effect. The alternating thermal regime promoted synchrony in the timing of spiracle apolysis (the earliest morphological marker of molt). Rutin disrupted that synchrony. I discuss how patterns of host plant resistance may be altered with a decrease in amplitude of diurnal temperatures (as has been documented recently for temperate regions) through the uncoupling of herbivore performance and allelochemical concentration. I conclude that simultaneous consideration of fluctuating temperatures and allelochemicals is advisable when assessing the effects of temperature and allelochemcials on performance of insect herbivores because interactive effects between temperature and dietary components occur and perhaps are common.","","","STAMP, NE (corresponding author), SUNY BINGHAMTON,DEPT BIOL SCI,BINGHAMTON,NY 13902, USA.","","Stamp, Nancy E/C-3806-2011","","","","",NA,"44","24","24","0","5","KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL","DORDRECHT","SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0013-8703","","","ENTOMOL EXP APPL","Entomol.

When eggs of ectotherms are exposed to large temperature fluctuations, egg phenotypes and post-hatching traits may be altered, but little relevant information is available on insects. Hence, we simulated a set of natural diurnal temperature fluctuations each with the same mean temperature (25 +/- 0, 25 +/- 2, 25 +/- 4, 25 +/- 6, 25 +/- 8, 25 +/- 10 degrees C), to which we exposed the eggs of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), and assessed subsequent egg development, survival and post-hatching traits. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in these phenomena between the constant temperature treatment and the treatments with moderate temperature fluctuations. However, large temperature fluctuations slowed development and lowered hatching rate during the egg stage. In addition the effects of these large temperature fluctuations extended to the larval stage, but not to the pupal and adult stages. No apparent costs of compensatory responses, which occurred in the larval stage, were detected in the later stages. These findings indicate that fluctuating temperature effects are potentially important in predicting insect phenology and population dynamics. As an independent factor, the effects of temperature fluctuations on a stage in the life history must be factored into models for predicting insect development that are based on mean temperatures. The larger of the temperature fluctuations to which eggs of diamondback moth were exposed, affected development time, hatching rate, larval growth and pre-pupal mass.","[Xing, Kun; Han, Jv-Cai] Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Taigu 030801, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Xing, Kun; Zhao, Fei] Shanxi Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Shanxi Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Agr, Taiyuan 030031, Shanxi, Peoples R China; [Ma, Chun-Sen] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Climate Change Biol Res Grp, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Shanxi Agricultural University; Shanxi Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Plant Protection, CAAS","Zhao, F (corresponding author), Shanxi Acad Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, Shanxi Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Agr, Taiyuan 030031, Shanxi, Peoples R China.","zhaofei12@126.com; sxndhjc@163.com","Ma, Chun-Sen/K-5414-2019; 赵, 飞/AAC-8601-2019","Ma, Chun-Sen/0000-0002-3253-6921; Zhao, Fei/0000-0003-4158-3604","","","",NA,"51","17","18","3","37","FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC","LUTZ","16125 E LAKE BURRELL DR, LUTZ, FL 33548 USA","0015-4040","1938-5102","","FLA ENTOMOL","Fla.

How thermal evolution may affect trophic interactions and its implications for trophic system stability remains unstudied. To advance insights in how global warming shapes trophic interactions, we need to consider besides increases in mean temperatures, also daily thermal fluctuations (DTF) and heat waves (HW), and how their effects are modulated by thermal evolution. 2. Using a common-garden approach, we tested how each thermal factor affected predator metabolic rate and functional response parameters, and used these responses to predict long-term predator-prey interaction strength between larvae of the damselfly Ischnura elegans and the water flea Daphnia magna. Using high- and low-latitude predator populations with the latter being exposed to higher mean temperatures, higher DTF and more frequent HW, we assessed the potential impact of thermal evolution at the high latitude using a space-for-time substitution. 3. In line with thermal adaptation, growth rates were faster and handling times shorter in low-latitude compared to high-latitude larvae at 24 degrees C while the opposite was true at 20 degrees C. Warming weakened the long-term interaction strength, except for the high-latitude trophic system at DTF and HW where plastic responses therefore may not stabilize the high-latitude system. This extends the emerging insight that temperature variation may make ectotherms more vulnerable to warming. The contributions of metabolic rate, search rate and handling time in shaping thermal effects on interaction strength differed between latitudes. A key finding was that thermal evolution may further weaken the long-term interaction strength of the high-latitude trophic system under increases in mean temperatures, even at DTF and potentially also at HW. 4. Our results underscore the importance of daily thermal fluctuations and heat waves in shaping predator-prey interactions, and may suggest an overall stabilizing contribution of predator thermal evolution ameliorating thermal plastic effects on food web stability.","[Wang, Ying-Jie; Tuzun, Nedim; Stoks, Robby] Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium; [Sentis, Arnaud] Aix Marseille Univ, INRAE, UMR RECOVER, Aix En Provence, France","KU Leuven; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Aix-Marseille Universite","Wang, YJ (corresponding author), Univ Leuven, Evolutionary Stress Ecol & Ecotoxicol, Leuven, Belgium.","yingjie.wang@kuleuven.be","Tüzün, Nedim/H-8114-2019","Tüzün, Nedim/0000-0002-4743-1743; Wang, Ying-Jie/0000-0001-9091-6423; Stoks, Robby/0000-0003-4130-0459; Sentis, Arnaud/0000-0003-4617-3620","KU Leuven [C16/17/002]; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek [G.0524.17N, G.0956.19N]","KU Leuven(KU Leuven); Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek(FWO)","KU Leuven, Grant/Award Number: C16/17/002; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, Grant/Award Number: G.0524.17N and G.0956.19N",NA,"61","8","8","12","29","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0269-8463","1365-2435","","FUNCT ECOL","Funct.

Daily temperature amplitudes (DTAs) can significantly impact the traits of insects but there is limited evidence from the natural environment. Therefore, we studied the acclimation effects of DTA on the longevity, total fecundity, early fecundity, and thermal tolerance of adult diamondback moths (Plutella xylostella) under environmental conditions. The longevity, total fecundity, early fecundity, and heat thermal tolerance of adults significantly changed under different DTAs. These findings highlight the effects of DTA on the acclimation response in the P. xylostella phenotype, and DTA should be incorporated into prediction models for assessing insect populations and the effects of climate change. Daily temperature amplitudes (DTAs) significantly affect the ecological and physiological traits of insects. Most studies in this field are based on laboratory experiments, while there is limited research on the effects of changes in DTA on insect phenotypic plasticity under natural conditions. Therefore, we studied the acclimation effects of DTA on the longevity, total fecundity, early fecundity, and the thermal tolerance of adult diamondback moths (Plutella xylostella L.) under naturally occurring environmental conditions. As DTAs increased, male longevity and total fecundity decreased, and early fecundity increased. An increase in DTA was significantly associated with the increased heat coma temperature (CTmax) of both males and females, but had no significant effect on their cold coma temperature (CTmin). Our findings highlight the effects of DTA on the acclimation response of P. xylostella and emphasize the importance of considering DTA in predicting models for assessing insect populations and the effects of climate change.","[Xing, Kun; Zhao, Fei] Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Shanxi Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Agr, Taiyuan 030031, Peoples R China","Shanxi Agricultural University","Zhao, F (corresponding author), Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Shanxi Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Agr, Taiyuan 030031, Peoples R China.","xingkun@sxau.edu.cn; zhaofei@sxau.edu.cn","","","National Key Research and Development Program [2021YFD1901101-4]; Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province [201701D121113]; Foundation of Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences [YBSJJ1512, YYDZX16, YCX2018D2BH5]; Province Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi [201603D21110-2]","National Key Research and Development Program; Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province); Foundation of Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Province Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi","This research was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2021YFD1901101-4), the Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province (201701D121113), the Foundation of Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences (YBSJJ1512, YYDZX16, and YCX2018D2BH5), and the Province Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi (201603D21110-2).",NA,"67","1","1","7","20","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2075-4450","","INSECTS","Insects","APR","2022","13","4","",NA,"",NA,"","","309","10.3390/insects13040309","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects13040309","","","11","Entomology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Entomology","0T3OK","35447751","Green Published, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000786879100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Unstressed and stressed plants grown in optimal temperature conditions (25 degrees C) maintained higher growth rates (dry mass production) than plants grown under low and high temperatures (15 and 35 degrees C respectively). Shoot and root growth (dry mass production) were largely inhibited by salinity but the magnitude of growth inhibition was temperature dependent. Safflower plants respond to salinity stress by increases in Ca, Cl and to a lesser extent Na in their shoots and roots and by a decrease in the ratio of fresh to dry weight. The ratio of K/Na was decreased progressively on salinization. With stressed plants, ABA application reduced the toxicity of salt treatment, improved K uptake under salinity, effectively increased K/Na ratio and helped the plants to avoid Na toxicity and sometimes enhanced growth. The effect of ABA on the growth was more pronounced at optimum temperature (25 degrees C). The association between the internal mineral element concentrations was largely affected by ABA application and temperature change but a wide fluctuation in response was noticed. The effects of single factors (Psi(s), T and ABA) on the growth and mineral contents were statistically significant. Also, bifactorial (Psi(s) x T, Psi(s) x ABA and T x ABA) and three factorial (Psi(s) x T x ABA) interactions significantly affected the parameters. Further statistical treatment of the data (coefficient of determination eta(2)) led to four important findings: (1) Salinity (Psi(s)) was dominant in affecting Ca and Cl contents in both shoot and root as well as root Na content. (2) Temperature (T) had a dominant effect on growth, shoot K, Mg, P, S and root P, and S contents (3) The share of Psi(s) x T x ABA interaction was dominant for root Na and Mg contents.

Using a food web module of two consumers competing for a biotic resource, we investigate how temperature effects on species' attack and mortality rates scale up to population-level outcomes of coexistence and exclusion. We find that differences between species in their competitive effects ultimately arise from asymmetries generated by the nonlinear nature of the temperature response of mortality: cold-adapted species and thermal specialists limit themselves more strongly than they limit their warm-adapted and generalist competitors. These asymmetries become greater as seasonal temperature fluctuations increase, generating latitudinal variation in coexistence patterns and priority effects. Characterizing species' thermal niches in terms of mechanistic descriptions of trait responses to temperature allows us to make testable predictions about the population-level outcomes of competition based solely on three fundamental-and easily measurable-quantities: attack rate optima, response breadths, and temperature sensitivity of mortality. We validate our framework by testing its predictions with data from an insect host-parasitoid community. Simply by quantifying the three basic quantities, we predict that priority effects cannot occur in this system, which is borne out by population-level experiments showing that the outcome of competition does not depend on initial conditions. More broadly, our framework can predict the conditions under which exotic invasive species can exclude or coexist with native biota as well as the effects of climate warming on competitive communities across latitudinal gradients.","[Smith, Daniel J.; Amarasekare, Priyanga] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Smith, Daniel J.] Univ Chicago, Comm Evolutionary Biol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA","University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Chicago","Amarasekare, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.","amarasek@ucla.edu","","","","","",NA,"46","7","7","3","28","UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","CHICAGO","1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","0003-0147","1537-5323","","AM NAT","Am.

Organism: Pitcher plant mosquitoes, Wyeomyia smithii. Field sites: We established laboratory colonies from three geographic populations spanning a latitudinal and altitudinal gradient in eastern North America. Sites at lower latitudes or altitudes experience both higher mean temperatures and greater thermal variability during the growing season. Methods: For each of the three sampled populations we analysed the effects of rearing temperature, population, and sex on survival, development time, and mass at pupation for mosquito larvae reared at 16, 20, and 27 degrees C constant temperatures. We also measured the same variables in two fluctuating temperature treatments with means of 20 and 27 degrees C. Using mixed linear models, we tested for the effects of mean temperature, temperature variation, population, and sex including all data except those from 16 degrees C constant. Results: Temperature variation did not have a significant effect on survival to pupation at 20 or 27 degrees C constant. However, low survival at 16 degrees C constant compared with high survival after transient exposure to the same temperature implies that duration of exposure may affect survival to pupation. The effects of temperature variation on both development time and pupal mass depended on mean temperature. Differences between constant and fluctuating temperatures for both these traits were predicted by the non-linear relationship between development rate and temperature (the Kaufmann effect). Moreover, this effect appears to explain geographic variation in the relationship between temperature variation and the measured life-history traits.","[Ragland, Gregory J.; Kingsolver, Joel G.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Ragland, GJ (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.","gragland@ufl.edu","","","","","",NA,"50","87","89","3","46","EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY LTD","TUCSON","UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA","1522-0613","1937-3791","","EVOL ECOL RES","Evol.

Temperature strongly influences the rates of physiological processes in insects, including the herbivore Manduca sexta and its larval endoparasitoid Cotesia congregata. Parasitisation by C. congregata decreases the growth and consumption of food by larval M. sexta. However, the effects of temperature on parasitised caterpillars and the developing wasp larvae are largely unknown. 2. In this study, parasitised and unparasitised caterpillars were reared at three constant temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) throughout larval development. Caterpillar mass gain and consumption were monitored daily until wandering (unparasitised control group) or wasp emergence (parasitised group) was observed. Development time and survival to emergence were measured as metrics of parasitoid performance. 3. Parasitised M. sexta developed more slowly than unparasitised controls, but had similar cumulative consumption until the terminal instar. Parasitised caterpillars with relatively large parasitoid loads had higher rates of consumption and growth than those with smaller loads. Both temperature and parasitoid load strongly affected wasp success. Mean development time to wasp emergence increased with low temperatures and with large loads. The combination of warm temperature and large parasitoid loads greatly reduced wasp survival. 4. These results demonstrate the interactive effects of rearing temperature and parasitisation on host consumption and growth rates throughout larval development. In addition, wasp performance was affected by the interaction of temperature and parasitoid load size. High temperatures alter the dynamics of the interaction between the parasitoid and its caterpillar host, which could have far-reaching impacts as the global temperatures continue to rise.","[Moore, M.

Across small spatial scales, distinctions in daily temperature variation are common, but the role of such environmental variation in setting coral thermal tolerances has received little attention. Here, we take advantage of back-reef pools in American Samoa that differ in thermal variation to investigate the effects of thermally fluctuating environments on coral thermal tolerance. We experimentally heat-stressed Acropora hyacinthus from a thermally moderate lagoon pool (temp range 26.5-33.3A degrees C) and from a more thermally variable pool that naturally experiences 2-3 h high temperature events during summer low tides (temp range 25.0-35A degrees C). We compared mortality and photosystem II photochemical efficiency of colony fragments exposed to ambient temperatures (median: 28.0A degrees C) or elevated temperatures (median: 31.5A degrees C). In the heated treatment, moderate pool corals showed nearly 50% mortality whether they hosted heat-sensitive (49.2 +/- A 6.5% SE; C2) or heat-resistant (47.0 +/- A 11.2% SE; D) symbionts. However, variable pool corals, all of which hosted heat-resistant symbionts, survived well, showing low mortalities (16.6 +/- A 8.8% SE) statistically indistinguishable from controls held at ambient temperatures (5.1-8.3 +/- A 3.3-8.3% SE). Similarly, moderate pool corals hosting heat-sensitive algae showed rapid rates of decline in algal photosystem II photochemical efficiency in the elevated temperature treatment (slope = -0.04 day(-1) +/- A 0.007 SE); moderate pool corals hosting heat-resistant algae showed intermediate levels of decline (slope = -0.039 day(-1) +/- A 0.007 SE); and variable pool corals hosting heat-resistant algae showed the least decline (slope = -0.028 day(-1) +/- A 0.004 SE). High gene flow among pools suggests that these differences probably reflect coral acclimatization not local genetic adaptation. Our results suggest that previous exposure to an environmentally variable microhabitat adds substantially to coral-algal thermal tolerance, beyond that provided by heat-resistant symbionts alone.","[Oliver, T.

In the last years a number of works aimed at understanding the influence of daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations that affect cell metabolism, and thus biomass production efficiency, have been carried out. However the impact of temperature on cell mortality has never been considered, while temperatures higher than the optimal growth temperature are often reached in summer for outdoor cultivation. This paper explores the effect of high temperatures both on mortality and growth for cultures of Chlorella vulgaris in a photobioreactor. Viability was measured with fluorescein diacetate (FDA), and thus mortality and growth rates were estimated, together with chlorophyll a and intracellular contents in carbon and nitrogen. While the fraction of viable cells decreased at higher temperatures, viable growth and mortality increased from 20 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Chl(a):Cresults suggest that temperature induced photoacclimation in the viable fraction of cells at higher temperatures. A Hinshelwood model was fitted to the data and appropriately described the mortality increase with temperature. Mechanisms affecting growth and mortality rates at high temperature are then discussed.

Current warming scenarios indicate that rapidly fluctuating temperatures will become the norm; however, the interactive effects of global and local stressors on the performance of coastal species (especially under environmental fluctuations) have not been investigated. This study evaluated the combined effects of elevated temperature and nitrogen enrichment on the ecophysiology of algae Pyropia haitanensis. Algae were exposed to three different temperature regimes (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and increasing from 20 degrees C to 24 degrees C, then decreasing to 20 degrees C at a rate of 1 degrees C per day) and two nutrient concentrations (40 mu mol center dot L-1 and 300 mu mol center dot L-1). The resulting growth rates, photosynthetic performances, and photosynthetic pigment concentrations were determined and compared between treatments. All three metrics increased with increasing temperature, but decreased when the temperature increased at the thermal threshold of P. haitanensis (24 degrees C). Moreover, under fluctuating temperatures condition, both growth and pigment contents increased significantly. These results indicate that in current warming scenarios, both the yield and quality of P. haitanensis would improve. This effect is further increased by elevated nitrogen supply, due to coastal eutrophication.","[Wu, Hailong; Chen, Jiang; Feng, Jingchi; Liu, Yanhong; Li, Xuebing; Chen, Rui; Xu, Juntian] Jiangsu Ocean Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Marine Bioresources & Environm, Lianyungang 222005, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hailong; Chen, Jiang; Feng, Jingchi; Liu, Yanhong; Li, Xuebing; Chen, Rui; Xu, Juntian] Jiangsu Ocean Univ, Co Innovat Ctr Jiangsu Marine Bioind Technol, Lianyungang 222005, Peoples R China","Jiangsu Ocean University; Jiangsu Ocean University","Xu, JT (corresponding author), Jiangsu Ocean Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Marine Bioresources & Environm, Lianyungang 222005, Peoples R China.","jtxu@jou.edu.cn","Xu, juntian/ABB-8233-2021; Xu, Juntian/AAW-4084-2021","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41706141]; Six Talents Peaks in Jiangsu Province [JNHB-213, JY-086]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M632668]; 333'' project of Jiangsu Province; Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds [2018K025A]; Haiyan project of Lianyungang city [2018-ZD-005]; 521 projectof Lianyungang city [LYG06521202169]; Huaguoshan project of Lianyungang City; Lianyungang Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Six Talents Peaks in Jiangsu Province; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); 333'' project of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds; Haiyan project of Lianyungang city; 521 projectof Lianyungang city; Huaguoshan project of Lianyungang City; Lianyungang Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41706141), the Six Talents Peaks in Jiangsu Province (JNHB-213, JY-086), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (2018M632668),333'' project of Jiangsu Province, the Jiangsu Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds (2018K025A), Haiyan project of Lianyungang city (2018-ZD-005), 521 projectof Lianyungang city (LYG06521202169), Huaguoshan project of Lianyungang City,the Lianyungang Planned Projects for Postdoctoral Research Funds and Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",NA,"55","2","2","1","9","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0304-3770","1879-1522","","AQUAT BOT","Aquat.

It is one of the most important cereal pests. In Brazil, the economic losses associated with this aphid result mainly from the transmission of the barley yellow dwarf viruses. Decision-making for the adoption of management measures must consider the initial population size, the potential for population increase, and the time when this population will reach levels at which the resulting damage is equal to the costs of control measures. Consequently, the establishment of management programmes and decision support systems should be based on models that estimate the potential population growth of this pest species. Temperature is one of the main factors that determine the growth rate of insect populations. Generally, controlled experiments are designed to examine the relationship of temperature at fixed intervals in relation to the development phases of insects. In nature, thermal regimes are not constant, and population growth is the result of a series of combined events. In this work, the effects of different thermal regimes on the population growth ofR. padiwere compared. An agent-based model was used to estimate population growth, and the parameters defined in controlled regimes were compared with fluctuating temperatures under natural conditions. The temperature-driven model presented here can serve as a tool to predict population growth and decision-making for aphid management. The model structure and the proposed experimental design allow the addition of modules and layers of factors that can progressively affect the populations of aphids to gradually improve the model.","[Wiest, Roberto; Toebe, Josue; Lazzaretti, Alexandre T.] Inst Fed Educ Ciencia & Tecnol Sul Rio Grandense, Dept Informat, Estr Perimetral Leste 150, BR-99064440 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil; [Salvadori, Jose R.] Univ Passo Fundo, Fac Agron & Med Vet, Rodovia BR285, BR-99052900 Passo Fundo, RS, Brazil; [Fernandes, Jose M.

The: interactions between temperature and dietary protein concentration in affecting consumption, growth and efficiency in fifth-instar caterpillars of Manduca sexta were studied, using both short-term (4h) and long-term (duration of fifth stadium) experiments. The short-term experiments examined constant temperatures between 14 and 42 degrees C, whereas the long-term experiments examined constant temperatures between 18 and 34 degrees C; both experiments considered two levels of dietary protein. In both expects, caterpillars had significantly higher consumption and Erase production rates on low-protein compared with high-protein diets at each test temperature between 18 and 34 degrees C, thereby compensating for the lower diet quality. In contrast, at more extreme temperatures (14 and 42 degrees C) in the short-term studies, consumption and frass production rates were lower on low-protein compared with high-protein diets. As a result, there were substantial interactions between temperature and dietary protein for consumption and frass production rates in the short-term experiments, but not in the long-term experiments. These results suggest that interactions between temperature and dietary protein may emerge because of.,the failure of compensatory feeding responses at low and high temperatures. It is hypothesized that the failure of compensatory responses is more Likely to occur under diurnally fluctuating temperatures than under a constant temperature with the same mean, and it is proposed that interactions between temperature and dietary protein for consumption are relevant to M. sexta and other caterpillars that experience wide diurnal fluctuations in temperature in the held.","Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle","Kingsolver, JG (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Zool, Box 351800, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"20","41","41","12","52","BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND","0307-6962","","","PHYSIOL ENTOMOL","Physiol.

In these harsh ecosystems, snow algae survive, florish, and even become primary producers for microbial communities. How the snow algae maintain physiological activity during violent ambient temperature changes remains unsolved. To explore the cold adaptation mechanisms of the unicellular snow alga Chlamydomonas nivalis, we compared its physiological responses to a model organism from the same genus, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. When both cell types were exposed to a shift from 22 degrees C to 4 degrees C, C. nivalis exhibited an apparent advantage in cold tolerance over C. reinhardtii, as C. nivalis had both a higher growth rate and photosynthetic efficiency. To determine the cold tolerance mechanisms of C. nivalis, RNA sequencing was used to compare transcriptomes of both species after 1 h of cold treatment, mimicking temperature fluctuations in the polar region. Differential expression analysis showed that C. nivalis had fewer transcriptomic changes and was more stable during rapid temperature decrease relative to C. reinhardtii, especially for the expression of photosynthesis related genes. Additionally, we found that transcription in C. nivalis was precisely regulated by the cold response network, consisting of at least 12 transcription factors and 3 RNA-binding proteins. Moreover, genes participating in nitrogen metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, and polysaccharide biosynthesis were upregulated, indicating that increasing resource assimilation and remodeling of metabolisms were critical for cold adaptation in C. nivalis. Furthermore, we identified horizontally transferred genes differentially expressed in C. nivalis, which are critical for cold adaptation in other psychrophiles. Our results reveal that C. nivalis adapts rapid temperature decrease by efficiently regulating transcription of specific genes to optimize resource assimilation and metabolic pathways, providing critical insights into how snow algae survive and propagate in cold environments.","[Peng, Zhao; Liu, Gai; Huang, Kaiyao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Key Lab Algal Biol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Peng, Zhao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, G; Huang, KY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Key Lab Algal Biol, Wuhan, Peoples R China.","gailiu@ihb.ac.cn; huangky@ihb.ac.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [91851201]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 91851201 to KH).",NA,"67","4","5","12","49","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","1664-302X","","FRONT MICROBIOL","Front.

It is generally accepted that this phenomenon is a consequence of the non-linearity inherent in the temperature-rate relationship of insect development and is known as the rate summation, or Kaufmann, effect. Some researchers invoke an additional physiological mechanism or specific adaptation to cycling temperatures resulting in a genuine alteration of development rate. Differences in development rates at constant and cycling temperatures may have important implications for degree-day (linear) population models, which are used in bath pest management and ecological studies. Larvae of Aglais urticae L. (small tortoiseshell), Inachis io L. (peacock), Polygonia c-album L. (comma) and Vanessa atalanta L.

Development rates under the alternating regimes used were found to differ from those under equivalent constant temperatures in a pattern suggestive of the Kaufmann effect: in all species development at 20/10 degrees C was faster than at 15 degrees C, and for three species development at 30/20 degrees C was slower than at 25 degrees C. The exception was A. urticae. A similar pattern was found for growth rate and pupal weight.

We applied fluctuations that varied in frequency and magnitude at different times during development and measured effects on embryo physiology and survival, and hatchling morphology, growth and survival. Thermal tolerance differed between the species by similar to 2 degrees C: embryos of A. sagrei, a lizard that prefers warmer, open-canopy microhabitats, were more robust to thermal stress than embryos of A. cristatellus, which prefers cooler, closed-canopy microhabitats. Moreover, thermal tolerance changed through development; however, the nature of this change differed between the species. For A. cristatellus, thermal tolerance was greatest mid-development. For A. sagrei, the relationship was not statistically clear. The greatest effects of thermal stress were on embryo and hatchling survival and embryo physiology. Hatchling morphology and growth were less affected. Inter-specific responses and the timing of stochastic thermal events with respect to development have important effects on embryo mortality. Thus, research that integrates ecologically meaningful thermal treatments, considers multiple life-history stages and examines interspecific responses will be critical to make robust predictions of the impacts of global change on wildlife.","[Hall, Joshua M.; Warner, Daniel A.] Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 101 Rouse Life Sci Bldg, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Auburn University System; Auburn University","Hall, JM (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 101 Rouse Life Sci Bldg, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.","jmh0131@auburn.edu","Hall, Joshua/AAP-7302-2020","Hall, Joshua/0000-0002-5587-3402; Warner, Daniel/0000-0001-7231-7785","National Science Foundation [DEB-1564563]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (DEB-1564563).",NA,"56","18","18","2","17","COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND","0022-0949","1477-9145","","J EXP BIOL","J.

We thus tested how the development of Spodoptera littoralis and Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is influenced by exposure to an insecticidal genetically engineered pulverized powder of, Bollgard II cotton producing the Bt proteins Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, or an entomopathogenic fungus (Beauveria bassiana) under fluctuating temperatures in comparison with constant temperature. When temperature fluctuated symmetrically around 25 degrees C either in small range (+/- 5 degrees C) or in a large range (+/- 10 degrees C) on daily basis, development of both lepidopteran species was positively or not influenced in absence of additional stressors. Both species were affected by Bt-cotton when added at low concentrations to the artificial diet, but their reaction to Bt-cotton did not differ between fluctuating temperatures compared to a constant 25 degrees C. When H. virescens larvae were dipped into spore suspension of B. bassiana, all larvae reared at constant 25 degrees C died before pupation, while no detrimental effect of the fungus was visible in the fluctuating temperature regimes. In contrast, S. littoralis was not affected by the fungus in any treatment. Since fungal growth was reduced at fluctuating temperatures, this might have affected the infection rate in H. virescens. The results of this study indicate that fluctuating, compared to constant temperatures, can influence the susceptibility of pest insects to biological control agents, while temperature regimes seem to be less important for the efficacy of insecticidal genetically engineered crops.","[Ghazanfar, Muhammad Usman; Hagenbucher, Steffen; Romeis, Jorg; Meissle, Michael] Univ Sargodha, Dept Plant Pathol, Coll Agr, Sargodha, Pakistan; [Ghazanfar, Muhammad Usman] Agroscope, Res Div Agroecol & Environm, Reckenholzstr191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland; [Ghazanfar, Muhammad Usman; Romeis, Jorg] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Baltzerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Grabenweger, Giselher] Agroscope, Res Div Plant Protect, Reckenholzstr 191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland","University of Sargodha; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope; University of Bern; Swiss Federal Research Station Agroscope","Ghazanfar, MU (corresponding author), Univ Sargodha, Dept Plant Pathol, Coll Agr, Sargodha, Pakistan.;Ghazanfar, MU (corresponding author), Agroscope, Res Div Agroecol & Environm, Reckenholzstr191, CH-8046 Zurich, Switzerland.;Ghazanfar, MU (corresponding author), Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, Baltzerstr 6, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.","usmanghazanfar1972@gmail.com","Meissle, Michael/C-3127-2009; Ghazanfar, Muhammad Usman/ABD-4903-2021","Meissle, Michael/0000-0002-5391-7715; Ghazanfar, Muhammad Usman/0000-0001-6503-2108","Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship [2014.0884]","Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship","We acknowledge Monsanto for providing cotton seeds.

In the laboratory, the effects were tested on germination rates at constant (9.1-21.8 degrees C) and diurnally fluctuating temperatures at different soil water potentials. Linear, 010, expolinear and quadratic models were fitted to the data on rate of emergence against temperature. For model validation, field emergence was monitored in 11 sowings conducted in 2001-2004. Emergence rate increased with temperature and was relatively high at soil water potentials in the range of -0.21 MPa to -2.6 x 10(-3) MPa, but was almost zero at -0.96 MPa and -1.8 X 10(-3) MPa. Diurnal temperature fluctuations did not have a differing influence on germination rates or final germination percentages compared with constant temperatures. The expolinear and the quadratic models were most accurate in explaining variation of laboratory data, especially at temperatures close to the minimum germination temperature of S. sisymbriffolium. These two models had root mean square errors for predicting field emergence rates (5.9 to 38.4d) of 0.81 and 0.87d, respectively, and were considered more appropriate to predict the time to 50% germination for crops grown in conditions near their 'base temperature' than the widely used linear temperature (thermal time) models. The Gompertz function was fitted to percentage germination versus the time-accumulated germination rate (using the expolinear function to describe the rate-temperature relation). This combined model adequately predicted the temporal pattern of emergence in the field.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Crop & Weed Ecol Plant Sci Grp, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands","Wageningen University & Research","Timmermans, BGH (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Crop & Weed Ecol Plant Sci Grp, PO Box 430, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands.","b.timmermans@louisbolk.nl","Stomph, Tjeerd-Jan/AAU-2582-2021","Vos, Jan/0000-0001-9614-628X; Stomph, Tjeerd Jan/0000-0001-5984-1523","","","",NA,"33","19","20","0","8","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND","0960-2585","","","SEED SCI RES","Seed Sci.

Thus, adaptation of physiological mechanisms to the thermal environments is important for achieving optimal performance and fitness. The European Common Frog, Rana temporaria, is widely distributed across different thermal habitats. This makes it an exceptional model for studying the adaptations to different thermal conditions. We raised tadpoles from Germany and Croatia at two constant temperature treatments (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C), and under natural temperature fluctuations (in outdoor treatments), and tested how different developmental temperatures affected developmental traits, that is, length of larval development, morphometrics, and body condition, as well as jumping performance of metamorphs. Our results revealed population-specific differences in developmental time, body condition, and jumping performance. Croatian frogs developed faster in all treatments, were heavier, in better body condition, and had longer hind limbs and better jumping abilities than German metamorphs. The populations further differed in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance. While metamorphs from Croatia increased their jumping performance with higher temperatures, German metamorphs reached their performance maximum at lower temperatures. These population-specific differences in common environments indicate local genetic adaptation, with southern populations being better adapted to higher temperatures than those from north of the Alps.","[Drakulic, Sanja; Roedel, Mark-Oliver] Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Feldhaar, Heike; Seiler, Michael] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth Ctr Ecol & Environm Res BayCEER, Dept Anim Ecol 1, Bayreuth, Germany; [Lisicic, Duje; Mioc, Mia] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Anim Physiol, Zagreb 41000, Croatia; [Cizelj, Ivan] Zool Garden Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; [Spatz, Theresa] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Anim Ecol & Trop Biol, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany","Leibniz Institut fur Evolutions und Biodiversitatsforschung; University of Bayreuth; University of Zagreb; University of Wurzburg","Rodel, MO (corresponding author), Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.","mo.roedel@mfn-berlin.de","Lisičić, Duje/AAG-7819-2019; Feldhaar, Heike/AAB-8678-2020","Lisičić, Duje/0000-0001-5587-6518; Feldhaar, Heike/0000-0001-6797-5126","German Academic Exchange Service - DAAD; Leibniz Association Open Access Fund","German Academic Exchange Service - DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Leibniz Association Open Access Fund","German Academic Exchange Service - DAAD (Grant/Award Number: Research Grants for Doctoral Candidates and Young Academics and Scientists); Leibniz Association Open Access Fund.",NA,"78","14","15","0","50","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

To address these issues, species thermal diversity needs to be considered. To explore how thermal diversity affects community temperature responses, I construct a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) model in which phytoplankton is represented by multiple species with different temperature performance curves. Each curve is determined by a master thermal trait, optimal temperature. I then create two levels of phytoplankton thermal diversity by varying the zooplankton prey density-dependent feeding preference (if zooplankton prefers to feed on abundant prey, prey diversity is enhanced). I find that the responses of the community productivity to temperature is dampened at high diversity compared to low diversity, due to the lower interspecific temperature sensitivity than the intraspecific one. High thermal diversity also confers the community a better capacity to track the environmental temperature fluctuation and withstand high temperature inhibition. In addition, thermal diversity increases community mean optimal temperature. I propose that the community temperature sensitivity is not static and urge that distributions of thermal traits of natural assemblages ought to be measured.","[Chen, Bingzhang] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Math & Stat, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Chen, Bingzhang] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong Branch, Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Guangzho, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","University of Strathclyde; Hong Kong Branch of the Southern Marine Science & Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou); Hong Kong University of Science & Technology","Chen, BZ (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Math & Stat, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.","bingzhang.chen@strath.ac.uk","","Chen, Bingzhang/0000-0002-1573-7473","Hong Kong Branch of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou) [SM-SEGL20SC02]; Leverhulme Trust Research, UK Project Grant [RPG-2020-389]","Hong Kong Branch of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou); Leverhulme Trust Research, UK Project Grant","I thank David J.

Here, the optimum is defined as the design that yields the lowest net present sink for the lifetime of the cultivation unit. Models are developed for tubular, column, and flat plate photobioreactors by considering diurnal pattern of sunlight and temperature fluctuations. As part of the case study, algae growth is modeled for 10 years in each cultivation unit using two species and four locations, resulting in twenty-four optimization problems. Each optimization model is implemented in GAMS 23.6.5 and the solution is obtained using CONOPT (version 3.14W) solver. The results indicate that algae species with higher oil content requires smaller reactor volume to produce the desired amount of biomass. The results also reveal that the geographical location with higher incident solar irradiance may not necessarily be the optimal location for algae culturing because higher irradiance may lead to cell damage, and hence, lower growth rates. Among the options considered in the case study, the design of tubular photobioreactor for culturing Phaeodactylum tricornutum at Hyderabad, India yields the minimum net present sink.

Salinities above 15 psu had a lesser effect on growth rate, as might be expected for an estuarine species. Growth rates of cultures exposed to natural light and temperature fluctuations were comparable to laboratory cultures. The minimum N cell quota suggested that high N flux would be required to support bloom development. A literature survey of documented A. monilatum blooms indicated that within US waters, blooms occur in July-September in nearshore or estuarine regions of the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Atlantic coast. Temperature and salinity measured during blooms correspond to the optimal growth conditions of the laboratory cultures. Nevertheless, the occurrence of A. monilatum blooms is sporadic compared to the occurrence of seemingly optimal growth conditions. Laboratory growth experiments predict when blooms of this species are unlikely due to low growth rates, but so far cannot predict individual blooms. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

After continuous exposure to EMR, M. aquaticum plants exhibited a statistically significant 51 +/- 16% reduction in NERF standard deviation. Temperature observations revealed that EMR exposure did not cause dielectric heating of the plants. Therefore, the reduced NERF was due to a non-thermal effect caused by EMR exposure.

Dietary chlorogenic acid, rutin and tomatine levels reflected those occurring naturally in the leaves of tomato, a hostplant of this herbivore. We compared the effects of four thermal regimes having a daytime temperature of 26 degrees C, with the night-time temperature increased from 14 to 26 degrees C by increments of 4 degrees C. The effect of a particular allelochemical on developmental rate was similar among the four thermal regimes. Chlorogenic acid and tomatine each reduced final larval weight, but there was no effect of night-time temperature. In contrast, rutin had no effect on final weight, whereas final weight declined with increasing night-time temperature. Night-time temperature did not influence amount eaten. Larvae ate less when chlorogenic acid or tomatine was in the diet. For each allelochemical, there were no allelochemical by thermal regime interactions. In addition, we compared the effects of allelochemicals and the thermal regime of 26:14 degrees C and constant 20 degrees C, which was the average temperature of the 26:14 degrees C regime. Developmental rate was lower at the constant 20 degrees C regime, chlorogenic acid and tomatine each depressed developmental rate, and there were no allelochemical by thermal regime interactions. Thus, regardless of the specific allelochemical or amount, the pattern of response at the fluctuating regime was similar to that at the constant temperature. In contrast, comparison of the thermal regime of 26:22 degrees C and constant 24 degrees C, which was the average temperature of the 26:22 degrees C regime, showed several allelochemical by thermal regime interactions. At the 26:22 degrees C regime, developmental rate was disproportionatly higher at the maximal rutin concentration compared to that at constant 24 degrees C. At the constant 24 degrees C, final larval mass was disproportionately lower at the moderate tomatine concentration compared to that at the 26:22 degrees C regime. Because these results differ from that of other studies examining another species, it appears that the response to incremental changes in night-time temperature will reflect the allelochemicals and insect species tested. The contrast between the constant 24 degrees C and 26:22 degrees C regimes indicates that even small fluctuations (+/-2 degrees C) in temperature over 24 h can yield differences in the response to an allelochemical.","","","Stamp, NE (corresponding author), SUNY BINGHAMTON, DEPT BIOL SCI, BOX 6000, BINGHAMTON, NY 13902 USA.","","Stamp, Nancy E/C-3806-2011","","","","",NA,"24","3","4","0","17","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0013-8703","1570-7458","","ENTOMOL EXP APPL","Entomol.

Surviving such episodes of stress requires a rapid acclimation response, e.g., by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Persistent change of the environmental context, however, requires longer-term adaptation at the genetic level. Fast-growing unicellular aquatic eukaryotes enable analysis of adaptive responses at the genetic level in a laboratory setting. In this study, we applied continuous cold stress (28 degrees C) to the thermoacidophile red alga G. sulphuraria, which is 14 degrees C below its optimal growth temperature of 42 degrees C. Cold stress was applied for more than 100 generations to identify components that are critical for conferring thermal adaptation. After cold exposure for more than 100 generations, the cold-adapted samples grew similar to 30% faster than the starting population. Whole-genome sequencing revealed 757 variants located on 429 genes (6.1% of the transcriptome) encoding molecular functions involved in cell cycle regulation, gene regulation, signaling, morphogenesis, microtubule nucleation, and transmembrane transport. CpG islands located in the intergenic region accumulated a significant number of variants, which is likely a sign of epigenetic remodeling. We present 20 candidate genes and three putative cis-regulatory elements with various functions most affected by temperature. Our work shows that natural selection toward temperature tolerance is a complex systems biology problem that involves gradual reprogramming of an intricate gene network and deeply nested regulators.","[Rossoni, Alessandro W.; Weber, Andreas P.

One example is the amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which has led to widespread amphibian population declines. Understanding its thermal ecology is essential to effectively predict outbreaks. Studies that examine the impact of temperature on hosts and pathogens often do so in controlled constant temperatures. Although varying temperature experiments are becoming increasingly common, it is unrealistic to test every temperature scenario. Thus, reliable methods that use constant temperature data to predict performance in varying temperatures are needed. In this study, we tested whether we could accurately predict Bd growth in three varying temperature regimes, using a Bayesian hierarchical model fit with constant temperature Bd growth data. We fit the Bayesian hierarchical model five times, each time changing the thermal performance curve (TPC) used to constrain the logistic growth rate to determine how TPCs influence the predictions. We then validated the model predictions using Bd growth data collected from the three tested varying temperature regimes. Although all TPCs overpredicted Bd growth in the varying temperature regimes, some functional forms performed better than others. Varying temperature impacts on disease systems are still not well understood and improving our understanding and methodologies to predict these effects could provide insights into disease systems and help conservation efforts.","[Gajewski, Zachary; Johnson, Leah R.] Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Gajewski, Zachary; Johnson, Leah R.] Virginia Tech, Dept Stat, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Stevenson, Lisa A.; Pike, David A.; Roznik, Elizabeth A.; Alford, Ross A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Roznik, Elizabeth A.] North Carolina Zoo, Asheboro, NC USA","Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; James Cook University","Gajewski, Z (corresponding author), Virginia Tech, Dept Biol Sci, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.","gzach93@vt.edu","","Johnson, Leah/0000-0002-9922-579X; Gajewski, Zachary/0000-0002-6544-2876","Division of Mathematical Sciences [1750113]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [R01A122284]","Division of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID))","Division of Mathematical Sciences, Grant/Award Number: 1750113; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Grant/Award Number: R01A122284",NA,"69","1","1","8","16","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Models of rates of development at constant temperatures of an example insect are compared graphically with predicted rates under artificial and naturally varying temperature regimes. Acceleration of insect development at low temperatures and retardation at high temperatures are shown to be implicit to the assumption of nonlinearity of development. The influence of the diurnal range of the temperature regime on the rate summation effect and the interaction between rate summation and the mathematical structure of a particular development rate model are clearly demonstrated. This study shows that the selection of a development rate function for prescriptive use, based on closeness of fit to developmental data from constant temperature experiments, is meaningless. Nor should selection be based on how well a model derived from constant temperature experiments predicts insect development measured under a narrow range of fluctuating temperatures. Reasons why a nonlinear model fitted directly to rates observed under variable temperature laboratory or field data is inappropriate for subsequent prediction (in theory at least), are clearly demonstrated. An appropriate technique that calculates instantaneous development rate functions from fluctuating temperature development time observations is tested with hypothetical data.

This leads to large seasonal fluctuations of population size, and strong evolutionary tuning of demographic processes (e.g. reproduction, somatic and population growth, and dormancy) for optimal match with the average annual alternation between good and poor growing conditions. However, neither environmental nor zooplankton seasonal cycles are exactly repetitive year-to-year. Recent analyses of several long zooplankton time series have found large (1-3 months) interannual variability of seasonal timing. In this paper, we compare and synthesize results from these studies. Variability in zooplankton phenology is often correlated with anomalies of one or more environmental variables. The most common phenology correlate is water temperature during and before the growing season, and the most common phenologic response to temperature is earlier when and where warmer. But several species with seasonal maxima in late summer or autumn have a clear later when warmer response. Covariance of seasonal timing with temperature must therefore involve more than thermal acceleration of physiological rates. We suggest that water temperature (relatively slowly and smoothly varying in aquatic environments) is also used by zooplankton as a timing cue, much as terrestrial biota uses day-length. During recent warming trends, temperature-linked changes in seasonal timing may have moved some species outside their locally-optimal seasonal windows (e.g. Calanus finmarchicus in the North Sea, and Pseudocalanus elongatus in the Adriatic), and have been a major contributor to changes in community composition. Between-location similarities of zooplankton phenology and temperature anomaly time series decay with increasing site-to-site spatial separation. The decorrelation scale is several thousand kilometers in the subarctic Pacific, but a thousand kilometers or less in marginal seas of the NE Atlantic.

Our previous work has shown that these characteristics are enhanced when a portion of gravity harvested algae is recycled back to the pond. To help understand the mechanisms behind the improved performance of P. boryanum dominated HRAP with algal recycling, this study investigated the life-cycle of P. boryanum. Experiments determined the exact timing and growth rate of P. boryanum life-cycle stages ('juvenile', 'growth' and 'reproductive') under four combinations of light and temperature (250 or 120 mu Mol/m(2)/s; 20 or 10 degrees C). Single juvenile 16-celled colonies were grown in microcosms on an inverted microscope and photographed every 15 min until reproduction ceased. Two asexual life-cycles and a rarely occurring sexual life-cycle were observed. The time required to achieve asexual reproductive maturity increased from 52 h (high light and temperature) to 307 h (low light and temperature), indicating that the minimum hydraulic retention time or mean cell residence time (MCRT) must be higher than these values to sustain a P. boryanum HRAP culture under ambient conditions. The net growth rate of a P. boryanum colony varied between life-cycle stages (growth > juvenile > reproductive). This suggests that the higher biomass productivity measured in HRAP with algal recycling could be due to both the increased MCRT and an increase in the net growth rate of the HRAP culture by 'seeding' with faster growing colonies.

It is therefore possible to construct predictive models of development that rely solely on temperature, which have applications in a range of biological fields. Here, we leverage a reference series of development stages for embryos of the turtle Chelydra serpentina, which was described at a constant temperature of 20 degrees C. The reference series acts to map each distinct developmental stage onto embryonic age (in days) at 20 degrees C. By extension, an embryo taken from any given incubation environment, once staged, can be assigned an equivalent age at 20 degrees C. We call this concept Equivalent Development, as it maps the development stage of an embryo incubated at a given temperature to its equivalent age at a reference temperature. In the laboratory, we used the concept of Equivalent Development to estimate development rate of embryos of C. serpentina across a series of constant temperatures. Using these estimates of development rate, we created a thermal performance curve measured in units of Equivalent Development (TPCED). We then used the TPCED to predict developmental stage of embryos in several natural turtle nests across six years. We found that 85% of the variation of development stage in natural nests could be explained. Further, we compared the predictive accuracy of the model based on the TPCED to the predictive accuracy of a degree-day model, where development is assumed to be linearly related to temperature and the amount of accumulated heat is summed over time. Information theory suggested that the model based on the TPCED better describes variation in developmental stage in wild nests than the degree-day model. We suggest the concept of Equivalent Development has several strengths and can be broadly applied. In particular, studies on temperature-dependent sex determination may be facilitated by the concept of Equivalent Development, as development age maps directly onto the developmental series of the organism, allowing critical periods of sex determination to be delineated without invasive sampling, even under fluctuating temperature.","[Rollinson, Njal; Massey, Melanie D.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Rollinson, Njal] Univ Toronto, Sch Environm, 33 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3E8, Canada; [Holt, Sarah M.; Nancekivell, E.

And in the condition range of 200-10,000 mu s pulse period and 50% duty ratio of pulsed light, there was no change in the growth rate of plants assuming the same PPFD as continuous light. These experiments showed the validity of the adaptive method in removing environmental fluctuations without precise control of temperature and humidity.","[Gonome, Hiroki] Yamagata Univ, Dept Mech Syst Engn, Yamagata 9928510, Japan; [Yamada, Jun; Nishimura, Norito; Arai, Yuta; Hirai, Minoru; Kumagai, Naoki; Rajagopalan, Uma Maheswari; Kono, Takahiro] Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Koto Ku, 3-7-5 Toyosu, Tokyo 1358548, Japan","Yamagata University; Shibaura Institute of Technology","Kono, T (corresponding author), Shibaura Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Koto Ku, 3-7-5 Toyosu, Tokyo 1358548, Japan.","kono.takahiro.f3@sic.shibaura-it.ac.jp","","","","","",NA,"23","0","0","0","1","SPRINGERNATURE","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND","","1756-0500","","BMC RES NOTES","BMC Res.

Jensen's inequality states that for non-lineal processes, such as most biological phenomena, the effects of thermal fluctuations cannot be predicted from mean constant temperatures. We studied the effect of daily temperature fluctuation (DTF) on Rhodnius prolixus, a model organism in insect physiology, and an important vector of Chagas disease. We measured development time from egg to adult, fecundity, fertility, body mass reduction rate (indirect measurement of nutrient consumption rates) and survival after a single blood meal. Insects were reared at constant temperature (24 degrees C), or with a DTF (17-32 degrees C; mean = 24 degrees C). Taking into account Jensen's inequality as well as the species tropical distribution, we predict that living in a variable thermal environment will have higher costs than inhabiting a stable one. Development time and fertility were not affected by DTF. However, fecundity was lower in females reared at DTF than at constant temperature, and males had higher body mass reduction rate and lower survival in the DTF regime, suggesting higher costs associated to fluctuating thermal environments. At a population and epidemiological level, higher energetic costs would imply an increase in nutrient consumption rate, biting frequency, and, consequently increasing disease transmission from infected insects. On the contrary, lower fecundity could be associated with a decrease in population growth. This knowledge will not only provide basic information to the field of insect ecophysiology, but also could be a useful background to develop population and disease transmission models.","[Rolandi, Carmen; Schilman, Pablo E.] UBA, FCEyN, DBBE, Lab Ecofisiol Insectos, Ciudad Univ,Pabellon 2,CABA C1428EHA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Rolandi, Carmen; Schilman, Pablo E.] CONICET UBA, IBBEA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires","Schilman, PE (corresponding author), UBA, FCEyN, DBBE, Lab Ecofisiol Insectos, Ciudad Univ,Pabellon 2,CABA C1428EHA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.","schilman@bg.fcen.uba.ar","Schilman, Pablo/GLR-8952-2022","Schilman, Pablo/0000-0003-1485-1650","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT) /Argentina [PICT-2015-3491]; Consejo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICET)/Argentina [PIP- 112-201301-00550]; CONICET","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT) /Argentina(ANPCyT); Consejo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICET)/Argentina; CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET))","This work was supported in part by Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT) /Argentina (PICT-2015-3491) and Consejo Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICET)/Argentina (PIP- 112-201301-00550).

(1) Conditions for using thermal time at a time step of 15 min were first tested successfully in 318 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of three mapping populations. (2) An analysis of 1989 time courses revealed a robust daily pattern of LER per unit thermal time (LERth) over several experiments. LERth was constant during the night and was reproducible (for a given RIL) over up to 10 consecutive nights in different experiments. It declined rapidly during the early morning, closely following the daily pattern of transpiration rate. (3) Groups of RILs carrying alleles conferring a high response to temperature had markedly higher night-time plateau of LER than those with low responses. Groups of RILs with high response to evaporative demand had rapid decreases in elongation rate at the transition between night and day, while this decrease was slower in groups of RILs with low response.

Stem extension rate was lowest in the early morning and increased throughout the day. In the late afternoon, 2-3-fold increases in extension rate occurred and were sustained for 2 to 4 h. After this growth surge, rates precipitously declined and remained low during the night. The temperature response of stem growth rate at constant water potential was determined using potted trees in a dark growth chamber Under such conditions, stem growth rate was strongly dependent on air temperature. In the field, the observed stem growth rate deviated from that predicted on the basis of temperature. These deviations were proportional to the rate of change in stem water potential. A model was constructed to pre diet diurnal patterns of stem extension rate using temperature and water potential data. The model was tested using data from undisturbed trees and from trees in which water potential was artificially manipulated. Growth patterns predicted by the model were in general agreement with observed rates.","UNIV CALIF DAVIS,DEPT POMOL,DAVIS,CA 95616","University of California System; University of California Davis","","","","","","","",NA,"34","43","44","3","16","MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD","COPENHAGEN","35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK","0031-9317","","","PHYSIOL PLANTARUM","Physiol.

When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability (> 20 degrees C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24 C) or fluctuating temperatures (18-32 degrees C) under high or low UV-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment.","[Kern, Pippa; Cramp, Rebecca L.; Franklin, Craig E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","University of Queensland","Kern, P (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.","pippa.kern@uqconnect.edu.au","Franklin, Craig/G-7343-2012; Kern, Pippa/AAU-5236-2020; Cramp, Rebecca L/A-4488-2010","Franklin, Craig/0000-0003-1315-3797; Kern, Pippa/0000-0001-8658-2811; Cramp, Rebecca L/0000-0001-9798-2271","University of Queensland postgraduate scholarship; Australian Research Council Discovery grant","University of Queensland postgraduate scholarship(University of Queensland); Australian Research Council Discovery grant(Australian Research Council)","P.

For a period of 3 mo, we placed four groups of snakes under four contrasted thermal treatments: (1) a natural regime (NR), based on daily variations (24-h cycle); (2) an accelerated regime (AR), where the thermoperiod fluctuated rapidly (12-h cycle); (3) a slow regime (SR; 48-h cycle); and (4) a cool stable regime (ZR; no fluctuation). The mean temperature, set at 23 degrees C, was identical for the four groups. For the first three groups (NR, AR, SR), ambient temperature fluctuated between 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Relative humidity and photoperiod were constant. We recorded feeding success, digestion efficiency, growth rate, activity, and ecdysis events. Differences between groups were expected because of varied exposure to the optimal temperatures, most notably in the ZR group, where the preferred body temperature for digestion (similar to 30 degrees C) would not be reached. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of the experimental treatment on feeding rate, digestion, body mass increase, and growth rate. Our results do not conform to the paradigm stipulating that maximal body temperature selected by ectotherms necessarily corresponds to the most efficient for resource assimilation and that temperature fluctuations are essential. We propose that increasing the digestive tract's performance through body-temperature elevation trades off against elevated (parasite) energy expenditure from the rest of the body. The main advantage of high body temperatures would be to reduce the amount of time necessary to assimilate prey rather than to improve the net mass gain during digestion.","[Michel, Catherine Louise; Bonnet, Xavier] CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UPR 1934, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, Beauvoir Sur Ni, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","Michel, CL (corresponding author), CNRS, Ctr Etud Biol Chize, UPR 1934, F-79360 Villiers En Bois, Beauvoir Sur Ni, France.","michel@cebc.cnrs.fr","","Bonnet, Xavier/0000-0001-6150-8199","Ecole Doctorale Diversite du vivant Paris 6","Ecole Doctorale Diversite du vivant Paris 6","C.L.M. was supported by a grant from Ecole Doctorale Diversite du vivant Paris 6.

The influence of temperature on the infradian rhythm of growth was also investigated. Discs of Ulva were grown in controlled laboratory conditions at different combinations of temperature (5, 10, 15, 20 degrees C) and irradiance (40 and 60 mol photons m(2) s(1)) under 12 : 12 h light : dark cycles. The growth rates exhibited a rhythmic pattern with one major peak every 2 or 3 days. Growth at 5 or 10 degrees C increased the prevalence of 3-day cycles and maintained U. lactuca in the vegetative growth stage. In contrast, growth at15 or 20 degrees C provoked a predominance of the 2-day cycle and induced reproduction. The 2- or 3-day cycles were combined in longer cycles having a period close to 6 days. We suppose that the 2-, 3- and 6-day rhythms of physiological processes are related to large-scale Rossby and Kelvin waves, which produce oscillations in the geomagnetic field and seawater temperature with the same periods. The predominance of 2-day or 3-day fluctuations of the geomagnetic field and temperature probably determine the prevalence of reproduction and vegetative growth, respectively, in Ulva.","[Kalita, Tatyana L.; Titlyanov, Eduard A.] Russian Acad Sci, Far Eastern Branch, AV Zhirmunsky Inst Marine Biol, Vladivostok 690059, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; National Scientific Center of Marine Biology, Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences","Kalita, TL (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Far Eastern Branch, AV Zhirmunsky Inst Marine Biol, Palchevskogo 17 Str, Vladivostok 690059, Russia.","t_kalita@yahoo.com","Kalita, Tatyana L./AAJ-3039-2021; Titlyanov, Eduard/AAD-6925-2019","Kalita, Tatyana/0000-0001-6296-1382","Russian Foundation of Basic Research [12-04-01424]","Russian Foundation of Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR))","We are grateful for the helpful comments of Professor Mario Giordano and two referees.

We conducted a common garden experiment using isolates of the fungal pathogen Rhynchosporium commune from nine barley populations representing climatically diverse locations. Clonal replicates of 126 genetically distinct isolates were assessed for their growth rate at 12 degrees C, 18 degrees C, and 22 degrees C. Populations originating from climates with higher monthly temperature variation had higher growth rate at all three temperatures compared with populations from climates with less temperature fluctuation. Population differentiation in growth rate (QST) was significantly higher at 22 degrees C than population differentiation for neutral microsatellite loci (GST), consistent with local adaptation for growth at higher temperatures. At 18 degrees C, we found evidence for stabilizing selection for growth rate as QST was significantly lower than GST. Heritability of growth rate under the three temperatures was substantial in all populations (0.580.76). Genetic variation was lower in populations with higher growth rate at the three temperatures and evolvability increased under heat stress in seven of nine populations. Our findings imply that the distribution of this pathogen is unlikely to be genetically limited under climate warming, due to its high genetic variation and plasticity for thermal tolerance.","[Stefansson, Tryggvi S.; McDonald, Bruce A.] ETH, Inst Integrat Biol, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Willi, Yvonne] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Biol, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Neuchatel","Stefansson, TS (corresponding author), ETH, Univ Str 2, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.","tryggvi.stefansson@usys.ethz.ch","McDonald, Bruce A/A-2748-2008","McDonald, Bruce A/0000-0002-5332-2172","ETH Zurich [TH-02 07-1]; Swiss National Science Foundation [PP00P3-123396/1]; Fondation Pierre Mercier pour la Science","ETH Zurich(ETH Zurich); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Fondation Pierre Mercier pour la Science","We thank Rita Saraiva, Valheria Castiblanco, and Mark Lendenmann for assistance in data collection and analysis.

This will affect plant carbon (C) balance because photosynthesis and respiration both respond to short-term (subdaily) fluctuations in T-l and acclimate in the longer term (days to months). This study asks the question: To what extent can the potential and speed of photosynthetic acclimation buffer leaf C gain from rising and increasing variable T-l? We quantified how increases in the mean and variability of growth temperature affect leaf performance (mean net CO2 assimilation rates, A(net); its variability; and time under near-optimal photosynthetic conditions), as mediated by thermal acclimation. To this aim, the probability distribution of A(net) was obtained by combining a probabilistic description of short- and long-term changes in T-l with data on A(net) responses to these changes, encompassing 75 genera and 111 species, including both C3 and C4 species. Our results show that (a) expected increases in T-l variability will decrease mean A(net) and increase its variability, whereas the effects of higher mean T-l depend on species and initial T-l, and (b) acclimation reduces the effects of leaf warming, maintaining A(net) at >80% of its maximum under most thermal regimes.","[Vico, Giulia] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, Ulls Vag 16,POB 7043, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; [Way, Danielle A.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Way, Danielle A.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Hurry, Vaughan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Genet & Plant Physiol, Umea Plant Sci Ctr, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Manzoni, Stefano] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Manzoni, Stefano] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Duke University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Umea University; Stockholm University; Stockholm University","Vico, G (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Crop Prod Ecol, Ulls Vag 16,POB 7043, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.","giulia.vico@slu.se","Way, Danielle/AAY-6395-2021; Way, Danielle A/N-1867-2014; Vico, Giulia/A-6296-2010; Manzoni, Stefano/C-5330-2009","Way, Danielle/0000-0003-4801-5319; Way, Danielle A/0000-0003-4801-5319; Vico, Giulia/0000-0002-7849-2653; Manzoni, Stefano/0000-0002-5960-5712; Hurry, Vaughan/0000-0001-5151-5184","Bolin Centre for Climate Research, Stockholm University; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Early Researcher Award; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Svenska Forskningsradet Formas) [2016-00998, 2018-01820, 942-2016-20001]; Swedish government's Strategic Research Environment Sustainable use of Natural Resources; Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet) [2016-04910]; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation; NSERC Discovery; Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and higher Education","Bolin Centre for Climate Research, Stockholm University; Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Ontario Early Researcher Award(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario); Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Svenska Forskningsradet Formas); Swedish government's Strategic Research Environment Sustainable use of Natural Resources; Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet)(Swedish Research Council); Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation(Ministry of Research and Innovation, Ontario); NSERC Discovery(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and higher Education","Bolin Centre for Climate Research, Stockholm University; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Early Researcher Award; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Svenska Forskningsradet Formas), Grant/Award Numbers: 2016-00998, 2018-01820 and 942-2016-20001; Swedish government's Strategic Research Environment Sustainable use of Natural Resources; Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet), Grant/Award Number: 2016-04910; Ontario Early Researcher Award; Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; NSERC Discovery; Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and higher Education",NA,"85","23","24","5","86","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0140-7791","1365-3040","","PLANT CELL ENVIRON","Plant Cell Environ.","JUN","2019","42","6","",NA,"",NA,"1913","1928","","10.1111/pce.13525","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.13525","","","16","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","HZ6NX","30706948","Green Accepted","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000468970600010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Nevertheless, the likely more stressful, realistic combination of the two warming-related stressors has rarely been considered in ecotoxicology. Moreover, we have little knowledge on whether these stressor combinations could impair ecosystem functioning. We examined the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos under an increased mean temperature (+4 degrees C, from 18 degrees C to 22 degrees C) and in the presence of DTF (constant and 8 degrees C) on two life-history traits (mortality and growth rate) and one ecologically important behavioural trait (feeding rate) in the freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus. The chlorpyrifos concentration used, 0.2 mu g/L, did not cause mortality in any thermal condition, nor did it cause sublethal effects at the mean temperature of 18 degrees C. A key finding was that growth rate was strongly reduced by the pesticide only under the combination of both a higher mean temperature and DTF, highlighting the importance of testing toxicity under this realistic thermal scenario. The leaf consumption of chlorpyrifos-exposed isopods increased at the higher mean temperature when this was kept constant, however, it lowered again towards control levels when DTF was induced, thereby contributing to the growth reduction at this most stressful condition. These alterations of growth and leaf degradation rates may impact nutrient recycling, a key ecosystem function. Our results highlight the importance of integrating both increases in mean temperature and in DTF to improve current and future ecological risk assessment of pesticides. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we investigated how variation in breeding pond temperature affects divergence in multiple physiological (thermal performance curve and critical thermal maximum [CTmax]) and life-history (thermal developmental reaction norms) traits in a network of Rana arvalis populations. The results supported adaptive responses to face two main constraints limiting the evolution of thermal adaptation. First, we found support for the faster-slower model, indicating an adaptive response to compensate for the thermodynamic constraint of low temperatures in colder environments. Second, we found evidence for the generalist-specialist trade-off with populations from colder and less thermally variable environments exhibiting a specialist phenotype performing at higher rates but over a narrower range of temperatures. By contrast, the local optimal temperature for locomotor performance and CTmax did not match either mean or maximum pond temperatures. These results highlight the complexity of the adaptive multiple-trait thermal responses in natural populations, and the role of local thermal variation as a selective force driving diversity in life-history and physiological traits in the presence of gene flow.","[Richter-Boix, Alex; Laurila, Anssi] Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Genet, Anim Ecol, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Katzenberger, Marco; Duarte, Helder; Tejedo, Miguel] CSIC, Estn Biol Donana, Dept Evolutionary Ecol, Seville 41092, Spain; [Quintela, Maria] Univ A Coruna, Grp Invest BIOCOST, Coruna 15071, Spain","Uppsala University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Biologica de Donana (EBD); Universidade da Coruna","Richter-Boix, A (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Dept Ecol & Genet, Anim Ecol, Norbyvagen 18D, SE-75236 Uppsala, Sweden.","richterboixalex@gmail.com","Richter-Boix, Alex/E-3990-2012","Richter-Boix, Alex/0000-0002-8559-5191; Laurila, Anssi/0000-0001-8090-3776","Spanish postdoctoral grants [MEC2007-0944, 2008-BP-A-00032]; MICINN [CGL2009-12767-C02-02]; MINECO [CGL2012-40246-C02-01]; Formas grant [2007-903]","Spanish postdoctoral grants; MICINN(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); MINECO(Spanish Government); Formas grant","We thank L.

These approaches are particularly relevant for grapevine organogenesis, which is a highly plastic process dependent on temperature, solar radiation, soil water deficit and trophic competition. Methods The extent to which three plant growth models were able to deal with the observed plasticity of axis organogenesis was assessed. In the first model, axis organogenesis was dependent solely on temperature, through thermal time. In the second model, axis organogenesis was modelled through functional relationships linking meristem activity and trophic competition. In the last model, the rate of phytomer appearence on each axis was modelled as a function of both the trophic status of the plant and the direct effect of soil water content on potential meristem activity. Key Results The model including relationships between trophic competition and meristem behaviour involved a decrease in the root mean squared error (RMSE) for the simulations of organogenesis by a factor nine compared with the thermal time-based model. Compared with the model in which axis organogenesis was driven only by trophic competition, the implementation of relationships between water deficit and meristem behaviour improved organogenesis simulation results, resulting in a three times divided RMSE. The resulting model can be seen as a first attempt to build a comprehensive complete plant growth model simulating the development of the whole plant in fluctuating conditions of temperature, solar radiation and soil water content. Conclusions We propose a new hypothesis concerning the effects of the different determinants of axis organogenesis. The rate of phytomer appearance according to thermal time was strongly affected by the plant trophic status and soil water deficit. Futhermore, the decrease in meristem activity when soil water is depleted does not result from source/sink imbalances.","[Pallas, B.; Lecoeur, J.] Montpellier SupAgro, Dept Sci Vegetal, F-34060 Montpellier, France; [Pallas, B.; Loi, C.; Cournede, P.

For example, organisms inhabiting environments with highly fluctuating thermal regimes might be less susceptible to the increasing frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves (MHWs). In this study, we assessed the metabolic and calcification responses of the rhodolith-bed forming Phymatolithon lusitanicum, from a coastal region that is strongly influenced by frequent changes between upwelling and downwelling conditions, to a simulated MHW scenario, with and without prior exposure to a moderate thermal stress. This allowed determining not only the influence of the species' long-term thermal history on its resilience against MHWs, but also the rhodoliths capacity for short-term thermal stress memory and its importance during posterior MHW-exposure. Our findings indicate that the rhodoliths experienced negative impacts on daily net primary production (DNP) and calcification (DNC) during the MHW. The effect on the former was only temporary at the beginning of the MHW, while DNC was highly impacted, but exhibited a quick recovery after the event, suggesting a high resilience of the species. Furthermore, prior exposure to a moderate temperature increase, such as those occurring frequently in the natural habitat of the species, mitigated the effects of a subsequent MHW on DNP, while promoting a faster recovery of DNC after the event. Thus, our findings (1) support the hypothesis that benthic organisms living in nearshore habitats may benefit from the natural short-term temperature fluctuations in these environments with an increased resistance to MHW impacts and (2) provide first-time evidence for thermally induced stress memory in coralline algae.","[Schubert, Nadine; Santos, Rui; Silva, Joao] Univ Algarve, CCMAR Ctr Marine Sci, Faro, Portugal","Universidade do Algarve","Schubert, N (corresponding author), Univ Algarve, CCMAR Ctr Marine Sci, Faro, Portugal.","nadine_schubert@hotmail.com","Schubert, Nadine/C-6179-2009; Silva, Joao/J-7874-2013","Schubert, Nadine/0000-0001-7161-7882; Silva, Joao/0000-0002-7211-1661","","","",NA,"81","1","1","6","10","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

The seedlings were grown in pots with pear, which were placed outdoors under a clear roof (natural light and temperature) or in a greenhouse (natural light and increased temperature). The plants were exposed to two nutrient (1 and 10 g nitrogen m(-2) season(-1)) and two temperature regimes (ambient and ca 2.5 degrees C above ambient) in a factorial design. The climatic conditions were rather different during the two years of the study, which clearly affected the growth and nitrogen economy of the birch seedlings. Nutrient supply was the main growth-limiting factor during 1992, which resulted in high root growth and a high leaf area per unit plant biomass (leaf area ratio). In contrast, during 1993 temperature was the main growth-limiting factor, which resulted in high leaf growth and a high biomass production per unit leaf area (leaf area productivity). Relative growth rate was affected by temperature early in the season (early to late June), and by plant nitrogen concentration during mid-season (late June to mid August). There were indications of substantial nutrient uptake by the birch seedlings during the winter season (September to May). The inter-annual variations in growth and nitrogen economy are interpreted as consequences of physiological adjustments to the different climatic conditions during the two growing seasons studied. The role of phenotypic plasticity in determining plant performance in a fluctuating environment is discussed, particularly in relation to the variable environmental conditions typical of the natural range of the mountain birch in subarctic Fennoscandia.","ABISKO SCI RES STN, SE-98107 ABISKO, SWEDEN","","Weih, M (corresponding author), UPPSALA UNIV, DEPT ECOL BOT, VILLAVAGEN 14, S-75236 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.","","Weih, Martin/H-5093-2011; Karlsson, Staffan/J-3082-2012","Weih, Martin/0000-0003-3823-9183; Karlsson, Staffan/0000-0002-5739-5213","","","",NA,"40","27","27","1","14","UNIVERSITE LAVAL","ST FOY","PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA","1195-6860","","","ECOSCIENCE","Ecoscience","","1997","4","3","",NA,"",NA,"365","373","","10.1080/11956860.1997.11682415","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1997.11682415","","","9","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","XY287",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1997XY28700012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Understanding insects' thermal biology is therefore integral to population forecasting and pest management decision-making such as when to utilise crop spraying or biological control. Aphids are important crop pests in temperate regions, causing considerable yield losses. The aphid thermal-biology literature is, however, heavily biased towards the effects of rising mean temperatures, whereas the effects of fluctuating, extreme climatic events (e.g., heat waves and sub-zero cold periods) are largely overlooked. This study assessed the effects of laboratory-simulated heat waves and sub-zero cold periods on the survival, development period, and fecundity of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae: Microsiphini), in addition to assessing maternal effects on the birth weight and development period of the offspring of exposed individuals. Exposure to heat stress periods (total of 16h at 30 degrees C) significantly reduced aphid fecundity and increased physiological development period (in day-degrees) resulting in a reduced population growth rate. Cold exposure (total of 1.33h at -15 degrees C) reduced population growth rate due to an elongated development period (in days), but did not affect fecundity or physiological development period (in day-degrees). Both cold and heat stress significantly reduced aphid survival. Maternal experience of heat stress reduced nymphal birth weight although nymphal development period was not affected by either cold or heat stress. The results suggest that including the effects of fluctuating, extreme temperature events on aphid life history in population forecast models is likely to be of great importance to pest management decision-making. The demonstration of maternal effects on birth weight also suggests that cross-generational effects of heat waves on population growth rates could occur.","[Jeffs, Christopher T.; Leather, Simon R.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Div Ecol & Evolut, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England","Imperial College London","Jeffs, CT (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PS, England.","christopher.jeffs@zoo.ox.ac.uk","Leather, Simon R/H-7921-2019","Leather, Simon R/0000-0003-3007-8514","","","",NA,"76","45","50","3","131","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0013-8703","1570-7458","","ENTOMOL EXP APPL","Entomol.

Here we explore patterns of genetic variation and selection on TPCs and DRNs for insects in fluctuating thermal environments. First, we describe two statistical methods for partitioning total genetic variation into variation for overall size or performance and variation in plasticity, and apply these methods to available datasets on DRNs and TPCs for insect growth and size. Our results indicate that for the datasets we considered, genetic variation in plasticity represents a larger proportion of the total genetic variation in TPCs compared to DRNs, for the available datasets. Simulations suggest that estimates of the genetic variation in plasticity are strongly affected by the number and range of temperatures considered, and by the degree of nonlinearity in the TPC or DRN. Second, we review a recent analysis of field selection studies which indicates that directional selection favoring increased overall size is common in many systems-that bigger is frequently fitter. Third, we use a recent theoretical model to examine how selection on thermal performance curves relates to environmental temperatures during selection. The model predicts that if selection acts primarily on adult size or development time, then selection on thermal performance curves for larval growth or development rates is directly related to the frequency distribution of temperatures experienced during larval development. Using data on caterpillar temperatures in the field, we show that the strength of directional selection on growth rate is predicted to be greater at the modal (most frequent) temperatures, not at the mean temperature or at temperatures at which growth rate is maximized. Our results illustrate some of the differences in genetic architecture and patterns of selection between thermal performance curves and developmental reaction norms.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; Univ N Carolina, Dept Stat, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA","University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Kingsolver, JG (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, CB 3280, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.","jgking@bio.unc.edu","","","","","",NA,"49","86","88","0","67","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1540-7063","1557-7023","","INTEGR COMP BIOL","Integr.

It was, however, unclear how the detached U. prolifera responded and resumed growing after they detached from its original habitat. In this study, we investigated the growth and photosynthetic response of the detached U. prolifera to various temperature, salinity and irradiance in the laboratory. The photosynthetic rate of the detached U. prolifera was significantly higher at moderate temperature levels (14-27A degrees C) and high salinity (26-32), with optimum at 23A degrees C and 32. Both low (< 14A degrees C) and highest temperature (40A degrees C), as well as low salinity (8) had adverse effects on the photosynthesis. Compared with the other Ulva species, U. prolifera showed higher saturated irradiance and no significant photoinhibition at high irradiance, indicating the great tolerance of U. prolifera to the high irradiance. The dense branch and complex structure of floating mats could help protect the thalli and reduce photoinhibition in field. Furthermore, temperature exerted a stronger influence on the growth rate of the detached U. prolifera compared to salinity. Overall, the high growth rate of this detached U. prolifera (10.6%-16.7% d(-1)) at a wide range of temperature (5-32A degrees C) and salinity (14-32) implied its blooming tendency with fluctuated salinity and temperature during floating. The environmental parameters in the southwestern Yellow Sea at the beginning of green tide were coincident with the optimal conditions for the detached U. prolifera.","[Xiao Jie; Zhang Xiaohong; Gao Chunlei; Jiang Meijie; Li Ruixiang; Wang Zongling; Li Yan; Fan Shiliang; Zhang Xuelei] State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Sci & Engn Marine Ecol & Environm, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China; [Zhang Xiaohong] Qingdao Environm Monitoring Stn, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China","State Oceanic Administration","Gao, CL (corresponding author), State Ocean Adm, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Sci & Engn Marine Ecol & Environm, Qingdao 266061, Peoples R China.","gaochunlei@fio.org.cn","Zhang, Xuelei/AAT-2835-2021","","Special Funds for Basic Ocean Science Research of FIO [2012T08, 2014G33, 2008T30]; National Natural Science Foundation of China-Shandong [U1406403]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41206162, 41206161]; National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China [2010CB428703]","Special Funds for Basic Ocean Science Research of FIO; National Natural Science Foundation of China-Shandong(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China(National Basic Research Program of China)","The Special Funds for Basic Ocean Science Research of FIO under contract Nos 2012T08, 2014G33 and 2008T30; the National Natural Science Foundation of China-Shandong Joint Funded Project Marine Ecology and Environmental Sciences under contract No. U1406403; the National Natural Science Foundation of China under contract Nos 41206162 and 41206161; the National Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China under contract No. 2010CB428703.",NA,"57","43","49","8","110","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0253-505X","1869-1099","","ACTA OCEANOL SIN","Acta Oceanol.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of continuous and a sudden cooling event of the root zone on transpiration, sap flow rate, and level of cytokinins as well as gibberellins in the xylem exudates of tomato (Lycopersicon esculuntum Mill.). The plants were grown for 3 weeks in three growth cabinets with separate controls for top and root sections. The top part of all the cabinets were set at the same light, temperature and humidity conditions while three root temperature regimes: 12, 16/8 (D/N) and 20 degrees C were kept in the root compartment. Sap flow, in the tomato stem, was measured by the heat balance method. Within one hour after the root temperature dropped from 20 degrees C to 12 degrees C the sap flow rate fell from 37 to 17 g h(-1) plant(-1), the same value was found in plants that grew continuously for 3 weeks at 12 degrees C. This quick response suggest that low root temperature is affecting mainly the viscosity of root membranes and as a result water transport is reduced. Hormonal concentration differences cannot explain such huge drop in water transport in less than an hour. Cold root temperatures are common in early mornings of dry-land and desert conditions and may result in short supply of water to the leaves in the early day hours. Warming the soil by irrigation before dawn may prove valuable to annual glasshouse and plantation crops in desert and dry land conditions.","Tottori Univ, ALRC, Tottori 680, Japan; Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Agr, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; Univ Tokyo, Fac Agr, Tokyo 113, Japan","Tottori University; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Tokyo","Ali, IA (corresponding author), Tottori Univ, ALRC, Tottori 680, Japan.","","","","","","",NA,"25","2","2","1","6","JAPANESE SOC SOIL SCIENCE PLANT NUTRITION","TOKYO","BUSINESS CENTER ACAD SOC JAPAN 16-9, HONKOMAGOME 5-CHOME, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN","0038-0768","","","SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR","Soil Sci.

They were examined in the epidermis and all leaf tissues. (1) Meristem temperature affected relative elongation rate by a constant ratio at all positions in the leaf, If expressed per unit thermal time, the distribution of relative expansion rate was independent of temperature and was similar in all experiments with low evaporative demand and no water deficit. This provides a reference distribution, characteristic of the studied genotype, to which any distribution in stressed plants can be compared, (2) Evaporative demand and soil water deficit affected independently the distribution of relative elongation rate and had near-additive effects. For a given stress, a nearly constant difference was observed, at all positions of the leaf, between the relative elongation rates of stressed plants and those of control plants. This caused a reduction in the length of the zone with tissue elongation. (3) Methods for calculating cell division rate in the epidermis and in all leaf tissues are proposed and discussed, In control plants, the zone with cell division was 30 mm and 60 mm long in the epidermis and in whole tissues, respectively. Both this length and relative division rate were reduced by soil water deficit. The size of epidermal and of mesophyll cells was nearly unaffected in the leaf zone with both cell division and tissue expansion, suggesting that water deficit affects tissue expansion rate and cell division rate to the same extent. conversely, cell size of epidermis and mesophyll were reduced by water deficit in mature parts of the leaf.","INRA, ENSAM, Lab Ecophysiol Plantes Stress Environnement, Montpellier, France","Arts et Metiers Institute of Technology; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro","Tardieu, F (corresponding author), INRA, ENSAM, Lab Ecophysiol Plantes Stress Environnement, Montpellier, France.","tardieu@ensam.inra.fr","Granier, Christine/ABF-4997-2021; Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012; Muller, Bertrand/AAP-3575-2020; Christine, Granier/C-5226-2010","Muller, Bertrand/0000-0001-6387-9460; Tardieu, Francois/0000-0002-7287-0094","","","",NA,"32","172","184","0","38","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0022-0957","1460-2431","","J EXP BOT","J.

Artificial alterations of environmental fluctuations can have negative consequences for life history traits, including lifespan. In laboratory studies of aging, the role of fluctuating temperature is usually overlooked and we know little of how thermal fluctuation modulates senescence in vertebrates. In this longitudinal study we followed individually-housed turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri, from two thermal regimes; ecologically relevant diel fluctuations (20 degrees C - 35 degrees C) and stable temperature (27.5 degrees C), and compared their survival, growth and reproduction. Fish experiencing fluctuating temperatures had a longer median lifespan but reached smaller asymptotic body size. Within-treatment variation indicated that extended lifespan in fluctuating temperatures was not causally linked to decreased growth rate or smaller body size, but occurred solely due to the effect of thermal fluctuations. Male body size was positively associated with lifespan in stable temperatures but this relationship was disrupted in fluctuating thermal regimes. Females exposed to fluctuating temperatures effectively compensated egg production for their smaller size. Thus, there was no difference in absolute fecundity between thermal regimes and body-size corrected fecundity was higher in females in fluctuating temperatures. Overall, despite a brief exposure to sub-optimal thermal conditions during fluctuations, fluctuating temperature had a positive effect on survival and reproduction. These results suggest that the expression of life history traits and their associations under stable temperatures are a poor representation of the relationships obtained from ecologically relevant thermal fluctuations.","[Zak, Jakub; Reichard, Martin] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Kvetna 8, Brno 60365, Czech Republic; [Zak, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12800, Czech Republic; [Reichard, Martin] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot & Zool, Brno, Czech Republic","Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Vertebrate Biology of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Masaryk University Brno","Reichard, M (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Biol, Kvetna 8, Brno 60365, Czech Republic.","reichard@ivb.cz","Reichard, Martin/C-6563-2009; Žák, Jakub/ABG-4831-2021; Žák, Jakub/HMO-7100-2023","Reichard, Martin/0000-0002-9306-0074; Žák, Jakub/0000-0003-2845-8323; Žák, Jakub/0000-0003-2845-8323","Czech Science Foundation [1901781S]; SVV [260571/2020]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); SVV","This study was supported by Czech Science Foundation grant (1901781S).

In temperature integration, plants are supposed to compensate effects of temporarily deviations of the average temperature some time later by deviations in the opposite direction. However, little is still known on the effects of integration periods exceeding 1 day. In this study, effects of temperature integration on growth and development of single-stemmed cut rose plants were determined. Pruned rose shoots were placed in climate chambers in which light levels switched daily (2 days integration period) or weekly (14 days integration period) from high light intensity (300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) to low light (150 mu mol m(-1) s(-1)). Temperatures were kept continuously at 20 degrees C (control) or changed with the light intensity (phase, high temperature at high light intensity, low temperature at low light intensity) or changed opposite to the light intensity (counter phase). Bandwidths of temperature integration were 0, 6 or 10 degrees C. Under these conditions, buds grew out to harvestable shoots in approximately 45 days. At both integration periods, shoot length was significantly reduced with increasing bandwidths of temperature integration. Shoot dry weights were reduced when a bandwidth of 10 degrees C was applied. At both integration periods, rates of photosynthesis were primarily determined by light intensity. However, in the counter phase treatments, photosynthesis rate at high light and low temperature was reduced compared to the high light condition of the control. Under these conditions, starch content increased to approximately 10%, suggesting a feedback inhibition of the rate of photosynthesis. However, this did not (yet) affect plant growth or development.

However, the costs and benefits shaping the evolution of different thermal responses are poorly elucidated. One of the possible constraints to phenotypic plasticity is its intrinsic genetic cost, such as genetic linkage or pleiotropy. Genetic coupling of the thermal response curves for different life history traits may significantly affect the evolution of thermal sensitivity in thermally fluctuating environments. We used the collembolan Orchesella cincta to study if there is genetic variation in temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity in life history traits, and if the degree of temperature-induced plasticity is correlated across traits. Egg development rate, juvenile growth rate and egg size of 19 inbred isofemale lines were measured at two temperatures. Our results show that temperature was a highly significant factor for all three traits. Egg development rate and juvenile growth rate increased with increasing temperature, while egg size decreased. Line by temperature interaction was significant for all traits tested; indicating that genetic variation for temperature-induced plasticity existed. The degree of plasticity was significantly positively correlated between egg development rate and growth rate, but plasticity in egg size was not correlated to the other two plasticity traits. The findings suggest that the thermal plasticities of egg development rate and growth rate are partly under the control of the same genes or genetic regions. Hence, evolution of the thermal plasticity of traits cannot be understood in isolation of the response of other traits. If traits have similar and additive effects on fitness, genetic coupling between these traits may well facilitate the evolution of optimal phenotypes. However, for this we need to know the selective forces under field conditions.","[Ellers, Jacintha; Driessen, Gerard] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Inst Ecol Sci, Dept Anim Ecol, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands","Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","Ellers, J (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Inst Ecol Sci, Dept Anim Ecol, De Boelelaan 1085, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.","jacintha.ellers@falw.vu.nl","Ellers, Jacintha/K-5823-2012","Ellers, Jacintha/0000-0003-2665-1971","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research [ALW-812.04.002, 864.03.003]","Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO))","We thank Tom van Dooren for commenting on an earlier version of the manuscript.

The models were initially expressed in a rate:state form and subsequently integrated resulting in two analytical solutions, representing two distinct types of growth: exponential (Model 1) and asymptotic (Model 2). Both models share the assumptions that growth machinery works at a rate which varies with water temperature and that growth is irreversible. In addition, in Model 1 it is assumed that quantity of growth machinery is proportional to live body weight and substrate is non-limiting over the period of growth; whereas Model 2 is based on the assumption that quantity of growth machinery is proportional to available substrate. Effects of seasonal variations in water temperature on fish growth are represented in both models by a sinusoidal function. The potential of these models was investigated through their ability to describe growth in eight datasets encompassing three species: European bullhead (Cottus gobio), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Models were evaluated using statistical measures of goodness-of-fit and through the analysis of residuals. Of the eight datasets, six displayed asymptotic growth while the other two exhibited exponential growth. Both models yield suitable simple growth functions with acceptable goodness-of-fit to fish growth curves under fluctuating water temperatures. However, Model 1, representing exponential growth, shows limited ability to predict fish size (length) when growth curves follow a clear asymptotic trend. This study enforces the idea that a given model is not always superior to another and that data structure and underlying model assumptions must be considered in model selection.

Summer heatwaves are predicted to increase in frequency and duration in the future, and could produce higher temperatures inside lizard nests. Increase in nest temperatures may influence offspring sex, body size, growth and locomotor performance, which in turn can affect fitness. We investigated whether incubation temperatures influenced the locomotor performance of hatchlings of the velvet gecko (Amalosia lesueurii), a nocturnal gecko that lays eggs in communal nests inside rock crevices. We incubated eggs at two fluctuating temperature regimes that mimicked current nest temperatures (mean=23.2 degrees C, range 10-33 degrees C, current') and predicted future nest temperatures (mean=27.0 degrees C, 14-37 degrees C, future'). We measured the locomotor performance of hatchlings at four temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C), and released them at two field sites (Nowra and Dharawal National Park, DNP') to estimate their growth and survival over 10months. Hot-incubated hatchlings were smaller, and ran more slowly than current-incubated hatchlings at all four test temperatures. Incubation temperature did not affect the growth rates of lizards from Nowra, but at DNP, hot-incubated lizards grew more slowly than current-incubated lizards. Survival analyses revealed that future-incubated hatchlings had lower survival than current-incubation hatchlings over 10months of life, but selection on hatchling traits differed between study sites. For hatchlings from DNP, there was evidence for directional selection on body mass, but little support for selection on SVL or speed. At Nowra, there was equivalent evidence for selection on mass, SVL and speed. These results demonstrate that incubation induced differences in morphology and locomotor performance can influence the survival of hatchlings. In the absence of maternal plasticity in nesting behavior, future increase in nest temperatures, by altering offspring morphology, performance and survival, have the potential to influence the viability of gecko populations.","[Dayananda, B.; Penfold, S.; Webb, J.

These paradigms together have been largely applied to macro invertebrates and vertebrates but rarely to microorganisms. According to these paradigms, foliar fungal pathogens are expected to respond directly to the fluctuations in leaf temperature, rather than in air temperature. We determined experimentally the impact of two patterns of leaf temperature variation of equal mean temperature, but differing in their daily amplitude, on the development of Zymoseptoria tritici, a fungus infecting wheat leaves. The highest daily thermal amplitude resulted in two detrimental effects for the pathogen fitness: an increase in the length of the latent period, i.e. the 'generation time' of the fungus when infecting its host plant, and a decrease in the density of fruiting bodies on the leaves. We discussed these empirical results, mainly the impact of both the daily thermal amplitude and the fluctuation frequency on the pathogen development in planta, in the light of the mathematical effect of the integration of non-linear functions. We concluded that it is necessary to take into account daily leaf temperature amplitudes to improve our understanding and prediction of the development of foliar fungal pathogens and other micro-organisms living in the phyllosphere in the climate change context.","[Bernard, Frederic; Chelle, Michael; Fortineau, Alain; El Kamel, Ons Riahi] Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, UMR Ecosys, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Bernard, Frederic] ARVALIS Inst Vegetal, F-91405 Orsay, France; [Pincebourde, Sylvain] Univ Tours, Inst Rech Biol Insecte, UMR 7261, CNRS, F-37200 Tours, France; [Sache, Ivan; Suffert, Frederic] Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, AgroParisTech, UMR BIOGER, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France","AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Tours; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","Chelle, M (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, UMR Ecosys, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.","michael.chelle@inrae.fr","CHELLE, Michaël/AAI-1409-2020; Pincebourde, Sylvain/B-9704-2008","CHELLE, Michaël/0000-0001-8151-1555; Sache, Ivan/0000-0002-6680-1615; Pincebourde, Sylvain/0000-0001-7964-5861","INRAE ('Plant Health and Environment' Division); INRAE ('Environment and Agronomy' Division); ARVALIS - Institut du Vegetal (CIFRE PhD fellowship); French National Research Agency (grant of the 'Investissements d'Avenir' programme; SEPTOVAR project; LabEx BASC) [ANR-11-LABX-0034]","INRAE ('Plant Health and Environment' Division); INRAE ('Environment and Agronomy' Division); ARVALIS - Institut du Vegetal (CIFRE PhD fellowship); French National Research Agency (grant of the 'Investissements d'Avenir' programme; SEPTOVAR project; LabEx BASC)(French National Research Agency (ANR))","We thank Fabrice Duhamel for technical assistance on experiments.

To identify plant traits that determine the poor competitive ability of Festuca pratensis compared to Dactylis glomerata especially during summer, the growth of both grasses was monitored over time and at different temperatures and photoperiods. Plants of both grasses were grown from seed with non-limiting nutrient supply at three day/night temperatures (11/6, 18/13 and 25/20 degrees C) and two photoperiods (16 and 12 h). F. pratensis had a significantly lower relative growth rate than D. glomerata, mainly due to its lower specific leaf area and reduced nitrogen productivity. At high temperature, F. pratensis had a considerably lower root weight ratio than D. glomerata leading to substantially slower root growth. F. pratensis responded to a shorter photoperiod with an increase in the net assimilation rate, whereas D. glomerata responded with an increase in specific leaf area. The low competitive ability of F. pratensis compared to D. glomerata was mainly associated with its lower specific leaf area and nitrogen productivity. The stronger decline of its competitive ability during summer was probably related to the decreased allocation of dry matter to the roots at higher temperatures which leads to slower root growth compared to D. glomerata.","ETH Zentrum, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Nosberger, J (corresponding author), ETH Zentrum, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Plant Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.","","Kölliker, Roland/D-9635-2018","Kölliker, Roland/0000-0003-1959-0402","","","",NA,"29","26","36","1","22","SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA","0029-8549","","","OECOLOGIA","Oecologia","DEC","1999","121","4","",NA,"",NA,"441","446","","10.1007/s004420050950","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050950","","","6","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","273VJ","28308353","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000084728300001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This analysis was carried out in a series of field experiments in northern and southern France over several seasons and years, and in growth chamber experiments. LER was measured with 10 min steps, together with meristem temperature, VPD and PPFD at leaf level in three types of experiments: in growth chamber experiments with steps in PPFD or VPD at constant meristem temperature, in growth chamber experiments with several combinations of constant, but contrasting, PPFDs, VPDs and meristem temperatures, and in the field with fluctuating conditions. (i) When evaporative demand was low (night or day with low air VPD), LER was only linked to meristem temperature, regardless of other climatic conditions. (ii) Light had no effect per se on LER in the range from 0 to 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for time-scales longer than 2 h, provided that its indirect effects on meristem temperature and on evaporative demand were corrected (in the growth chamber) or taken into account (in the field), and provided that cumulated PPFD over a weekly time-scale was compatible with field conditions. (iii) Evaporative demand sensed by growing leaves, as estimated by meristem-to-air vapour pressure difference, markedly affected LER in the range from 1-4 kPa, at all time-scales under study, with a unique relationship in the growth chamber (constant conditions) and in the field (fluctuating conditions). This effect was only observed when PPFD was high enough for stomata to open. The negative effect of evaporative demand on LER was probably not due to long distance root-to-shoot signalling, since soil was wet, calculated root water potential remained close to 0 MPa and concentration of ABA in the xylem sap was very low. Therefore, it is proposed to model maize LER with a two-step process, involving the calculation of the maximum LER at a given meristem temperature and then the calculation of the reduction in LER due to evaporative demand. Joint analysis of the whole set of data by using the two equations yielded a r(2) of 0.75. This two-step process would be more accurate than the provision of LER from temperature only in cases where air VPD frequently exceeds 2 kPa.","INRA,F-34060 MONTPELLIER 1,FRANCE","INRAE","","","Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012","","","","",NA,"30","73","74","0","11","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP","0022-0957","","","J EXP BOT","J.

Some CL-grown plants show increased productivity. However, in several plant species including tomato continuous light induces severe injury, which is only poorly understood so far. It is known that diurnal temperature fluctuations (thermoperiods) prevent CL-induced injury in tomato. The present study was undertaken to establish if a daily short-term temperature drop can prevent CL injury in tomato. Our research has revealed that after 3 weeks under CL (150 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) control tomato plants grown at 26 degrees C developed light injury symptoms but a temperature drop from 26 to 10 degrees C for 2 h produced healthy plants. Drop-treated plants were more compact and had higher dry weight (DW), larger leaf area (LA), doubled net photosynthesis, considerably higher values of maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m), higher chlorophyll a, b content and lower electrolyte leakage compared to the control. The developmental rate did not differ significantly in control and drop-treated plants. A daily short-term temperature drop also showed a benefit compared with thermoperiod (26 degrees C for 12 h and 10 degrees C for 12 h). Thus, drop-treated plants had higher plant DW, larger LA and greater number of leaves compared to plants treated by thermoperiod, although the latest ones did not develop the light injury symptoms either. This study demonstrated that a temperature drop treatment could prevent physiological disorders of tomato plants grown under continuous light, while enhancing growth without delaying plant development. The information obtained supports the hypothesis that a circadian clock entrained by temperature fluctuations can prevent CL-induced injury.","[Sysoeva, M. I.; Shibaeva, T. G.; Sherudilo, E.

However, there are few studies concerning the role of thermal variability on ecological processes. Based on insect thermal and population ecology, we propose a theoretical framework for organizing the study of the role that thermal mean and variability plays in individual performance, and how it may affect population dynamics. Starting with three predictions of global warming scenarios, we develop null models of the expected changes in individual physiological performance and population dynamics. Ecological consequences in each scenario may range from simple changes in performance to drastic changes in population fluctuations and geographic ranges. In particular, our null models show that potential changes in the intrinsic population growth rate (R-m) will depend on the interaction of mean temperature and thermal variability, and that the net effect of the interaction could be synergistic or antagonistic. To evaluate these null models, we fit performance curves to compiled data from the literature on measurements of R-m at several constant and fluctuating temperatures. The fitted models showed that several of the qualitative characteristics predicted by the null model may be found in the fitted curves. We expect that this framework will be useful as a guide to study the influence of thermal changes on the dynamics of natural populations.","[Estay, Sergio A.] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolutivas, Valdivia, Chile; [Lima, Mauricio; Bozinovic, Francisco] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, LINC Global MIII, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile","Universidad Austral de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile","Estay, SA (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolutivas, Casilla 567, Valdivia, Chile.","sergio.estay@uach.cl","Lima, Mauricio/F-2722-2013","Lima, Mauricio/0000-0002-3700-2945; Estay, Sergio/0000-0002-3797-8964","CONICYT [79100021]; FONDECYT [1130015]","CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT)","SAE would like to acknowledge CONICYT grant 79100021.

Their survival, development and subsequent asexual reproduction are likely facilitated by hyposaline seawater and potentially enhanced micro-zooplankton around the estuaries that comprise the major nurseries of medusae. In this study, 8-tentacled polyps that developed from planulae were incubated at 11 salinities from low to high (8, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 33) with 3 feeding frequencies (once every 3 d, once every 9 d, unfed; Brachionus plicatilis concentration: 0.16 mg C l(-1)) at a constant temperature (19 degrees C). Survival rate of early-developed polyps increased 3-fold at salinities 11 to 20, > 80% greater than at salinities 25 to 33. The composition of fully developed polyps, somatic growth, and podocyst diameter positively depended on food supply, except at salinity 8. The potential podocyst production of polyp colonization reached normal peak at salinity 20 in the group that was fed once every 3 d. Excystments were significantly restricted at salinity < 20. These findings confirm that estuarine areas with salinities from 11 to 20 are appropriate for N. nomurai polyp colonization, where prospectively increasing micro-zooplankton supply rooted in frequent eutrophication may benefit polyps. An asexual reproduction strategy also corresponded with autumn salinity fluctuations. The intensity of diluted water and monsoonal rainfall, as well as plankton supply around the estuaries in autumn may fundamentally affect polyp abundance and size, determining the population size of medusae in the following spring.","[Feng, Song; Sun, Song; Zhang, Fang; Li, Chaolun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Feng, Song; Sun, Song; Zhang, Fang; Li, Chaolun] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jianing] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Criteria & Risk Assessment, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jianing] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, Lab Riverine Ecol Conservat & Technol, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Sun, Song] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Jiaozhou Bay Marine Ecosyst Res Stn, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Sun, Song] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Laoshan Laboratory; Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences; Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Sun, S (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, CAS Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.;Sun, S (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.;Sun, S (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Jiaozhou Bay Marine Ecosyst Res Stn, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.;Sun, S (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.","sunsong@qdio.ac.cn","Li, Chao/GSM-8117-2022","Li, Chao/0000-0001-6110-6210; Li, Chaolun/0000-0003-1890-0587","State Key Program of National Natural Science of China [41230963]; Aoshan Science and Technology Innovation Project [2016ASKJ02-2]; Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Ecology and Environmental Sciences [U1606404]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA11020305]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1404405]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41706127]","State Key Program of National Natural Science of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Aoshan Science and Technology Innovation Project; Shandong Joint Fund for Marine Ecology and Environmental Sciences; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","We are very grateful to Professors Jennifer Purcell and Shin-Ichi Uye for constructive suggestions on the manuscript and editing.

In the CGC experiment, 35 days after planting (at the visible bud stage), the plants grown under low temperature conditions had high fresh weight (FW) of the stem and stem roots. At the flowering stage in both TGC and CGC experiments, the plants grown under low temperature conditions had a longer stem length and higher FW of the stem, flower buds, stem roots, and bulb compared than those of plants grown under high temperature conditions. The plants grown under low temperature conditions had high dry weight (DW) of the total plant, stem, and bulb, and a high DW/FW ratio of the stem and bulb. In both TGC and CGC experiments, the plants grown under the low temperature conditions showed a high relative growth rate (RGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) from planting to flowering. These data demonstrate that cooler growing temperatures are advantageous for the accumulation of dry matter in 'Siberia' lilies. The low growing temperature enhances the accumulation of dry matter in 'Siberia' lily plants via the promotion of photosynthesis by leaves and the absorption of nutrients by well-developed stem roots.","[Inamoto, Katsuhiko; Nagasuga, Kaori; Yano, Takayoshi; Yamazaki, Hiroko] Natl Agr & Food Res Org NARO, Tohoku Agr Res Ctr, Morioka, Iwate 0200198, Japan","National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan","Inamoto, K (corresponding author), Natl Agr & Food Res Org NARO, Tohoku Agr Res Ctr, Morioka, Iwate 0200198, Japan.","inamotok@affrc.go.jp","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [18580038]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18580038] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was partly supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (No. 18580038) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).",NA,"19","5","5","1","5","JAPAN INT RESEARCH CENTER AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES","IBARAKI","TSUKUBA, IBARAKI, 305-8686, JAPAN","0021-3551","","","JARQ-JPN AGR RES Q","Jarq - Jpn.

Here, we experimentally generate temporally fluctuating thermal environments that have either a negative, positive, or neutral relationship between the mean spatial environmental temperature and the degree of thermal spatial heterogeneity. We test the hypothesis that the timing of spatial variation relative to diel temperature cycles can meaningfully alter movement patterns and population dynamics, using the motile green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our results indicate that C. reinhardtii individuals growing in environments with positive relationships between spatial variability and mean temperature show reduced population growth rates, more directed movement as indicated by a reduced turning angle, and decreased negative thermotaxis over time, relative to those growing in environments with a negative relationship between spatial variability and mean temperature. We additionally document substantial regional variation in the dynamics of natural spatial variability by collecting summer water temperature measurements from five ponds in the Mount Saint Helens watershed, WA, USA.

The influence of the NAO on the growth of stream insects was examined using long-term empirical data on the sizes of mayfly and stonefly nymphs and oil water temperature data. Models of egg development and nymphal growth in relation to temperature were used to predict the effect of the NAO on phenology. The study was based in two upland streams in mid-Wales UK that varied in the extent of plantation forestry in their catchments. Winter stream temperatures at both sites were positively related to the winter NAO index, being warmer in positive phases and colder in negative phases. The observed mean size and the simulated developmental period of mayfly nymphs were significantly related to the winter NAO index, with nymphs growing faster in positive phases of the NAO, but the growth of stonefly nymphs was not related to the NAO. This may have been due to the semivoltine stonefly lifecycle, but stonefly nymph growth is also generally less dependent on temperature. There were significant differences in growth rates of both species between streams, with nymphs growing more slowly in the forested stream that was consistently cooler than the open stream. Predicted emergence dates for adult mayflies varied by nearly two months between years, depending on the phase of the NAO. Variation in growth and phenology of stream insects associated with the NAO may influence temporal fluctuations in the composition and dynamics of stream communities.","Univ Wales, Inst Biol Sci, Aberystwyth SY23 4NL, Ceredigion, Wales","Aberystwyth University","Briers, RA (corresponding author), Napier Univ, Sch Life Sci, 10 Colinton Rd, Edinburgh EH10 5DT, Midlothian, Scotland.","r.briers@napier.ac.uk","Briers, Robert/B-5810-2014","Briers, Robert/0000-0003-0341-1203","","","",NA,"45","38","41","0","26","BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD","COPENHAGEN","35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK","0906-7590","","","ECOGRAPHY","Ecography","DEC","2004","27","6","",NA,"",NA,"811","817","","10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.04005.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0906-7590.2004.04005.x","","","7","Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","882XY",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000225974900012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We tested with laboratory experiments the response of the pampean strain of B. plicatilis for two of its main stressors (conductivity and temperature). We evaluated the effects of eight conductivity values from 1 to 17 mS. cm(-1) and two temperatures (15 and 25 degrees C) to compare its abundance with those obtained in the pampean lotic and lentic environments, where this rotifer is frequent or dominant. The results demonstrated that the increase in population-growth rate and the peak of abundance occurred at the highest temperature and at medium conductivity. Minimum values were obtained at the lowest temperature and conductivities analyzed, but the final density attained was nevertheless similar to those recorded in the pampean environments at the optimum conductivity and during the spring and summer seasons. Males, mictic females, and resting eggs were observed at the minimum and maximum conductivities, revealing the strategy of this species for maintaining dominance in environments with fluctuating salinity. The experiments also indicated the possible behavior of this relevant member of the zooplankton community within a scenario of increasing temperature and salinity related to the climate changes occurring in the pampean region.","[Ferrando, Noelia S.; Claps, Maria C.; Benitez, Hernan H.; Gabellone, Nestor A.] UNLP, Inst Limnol Dr Raul Ringuelet, CCT CONICET La Plata, FCNyM,UNLP, Blvd 120 & 62, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); National University of La Plata","Ferrando, NS (corresponding author), UNLP, Inst Limnol Dr Raul Ringuelet, CCT CONICET La Plata, FCNyM,UNLP, Blvd 120 & 62, RA-1900 La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina.","nferrando@ilpla.edu.ar","","Claps, Maria/0000-0002-7459-3238","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT) [PICT 2012-0228]; Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP) [N737]; CONICET","Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT)(ANPCyT); Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP)(National University of La Plata); CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET))","This work was funded by Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (ANPCyT) (PICT 2012-0228) and Universidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP) (N737).

Here we ask if the larval decision to enter diapause when reared on a host plant associated with a colder habitat is an active or a passive response to host-plant quality or suitability. We compare plasticity in larval propensity to enter diapause of the habitat generalist butterfly Leptidea sinapis and the meadow specialist Leptidea reali in a range of temperatures and long day length oil a forest plant, Lathyrus linifolius, and a meadow-associated plant, Lathyrus pratensis. The warmer meadow habitat promotes direct development whereas the colder forest habitat is conducive to dispause. Larvae of L. sinapis had a higher propensity to enter diapause when reared on the forest plant L. linifolius across all temperatures. Conversely, the propensity of L. reali to enter diapause was consistently lower and did not differ between host plants. Larval growth rates were similar between and within butterfly species and between host plants. Hence, we conclude that larval pathway decision-making in L. sinapis is an active response mediated by information from their host plants.","[Friberg, Magne; Wiklund, Christer] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Stockholm University","Friberg, M (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.","magne.friberg@zoologi.su.se","","","Swedish Research Council","Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council)","We thank Karl Gotthard, Soren Nylin, Doug Whitman, and One anonymous reviewer for providing useful comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript, and Martin Olofsson for his assistance in the lab experiments and for fruitful discussions on earlier versions of this paper.

On a day-degree scale Upsilon(m) only varied from 0.019 to 0.028 because the growth of R(o) was compensated by an increase in T with increase in temperature.

Normally supply exceeds demand in cool temperatures, while the opposite is true at warm temperatures. To match supply and demand, photosynthesis is inhibited in the cool temperature range and synthesis (growth) is inhibited in the warm temperature range. The signal for the supply-demand imbalance is presumably obtained from the state of the carbohydrate pool (temporary storage), which fluctuates between a maximum level around sunset and a minimum level around dawn. A simple model, that incorporates this presumed mechanism, is presented and used to estimate the response of structural growth and of carbohydrate content to light and temperature in the cool and warm temperature ranges. The model predicts maximum growth rate at an intermediate temperature, which is positively correlated with light level. It also predicts an increase of nonstructural carbohydrate at cool temperatures. Both predictions are in qualitative agreement with observations. The model may be considered as an attempt at a mechanistic explanation of the observed phenomena, but experimental and modelling deficiencies currently restrict its predictions to the general features of the process only.","[Seginer, I.] Technion Israel Inst Technol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel","Technion Israel Institute of Technology","Seginer, I (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel.","","","","","","",NA,"12","4","4","1","9","INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE","LEUVEN 1","PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM","0567-7572","","978-90-66055-45-2","ACTA HORTIC","","","2012","956","","",NA,"",NA,"231","238","","","","","","8","Plant Sciences; Horticulture","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Plant Sciences; Agriculture","BGQ24",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000323764600025","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the life-history effects of temperature experienced during a window of embryonic development, that is egg stage, have rarely been considered. We simulated fluctuating temperatures and examined how this affects the operational sex ratio (OSR) of hatching as well as nymph and adult fitness in a leafhopper, Scaphoideus titanus. Specifically, after a warm or cold incubation we compared males and females hatching dynamics with their consequences on the sex ratio in the course of time, body size, weight, and developmental rate of the two populations, all reared on the same posthatching temperature. Males and females eggs respond differently, with females more sensitive to variation in incubation temperature. The different responses of both sexes have consequences on the sex ratio dynamic of hatchings with a weaker protandry after warm incubation. Temperatures experienced by eggs have more complex consequences on posthatching development. Later nymphal instars that hatched from eggs exposed to warm temperature were larger and bigger but developmental rate of the two populations was not affected. Our study demonstrates how incubation temperature could affect operational sex ratio and posthatching development in an insect and how this may be critical for population growth.","[Chuche, Julien; Thiery, Denis] Inst Sci Vigne & Vin, INRA, INRA ENITAB UMR Save Sante & Agroecol Vignoble 10, F-33883 Villenave Dornon, France","INRAE","Thiery, D (corresponding author), INRA, UMR Save 1065, 71 Ave E Bourleaux, F-33881 Villenave Dornon, France.","thiery@bordeaux.inra.fr","Chuche, Julien/B-6636-2009","Chuche, Julien/0000-0002-1547-7587","Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bordeaux; Region Aquitaine; INRA SPE","Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins de Bordeaux; Region Aquitaine(Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine); INRA SPE","We thank Drs A.

This paper proposes using water-based algal medium for thermal control of the spacecraft cabin, while taking advantage of the algae's photosynthetic activity for air revitalization. Consequently, this could expose the algal culture to transient thermal environments fluctuating between +4 degrees C and +30 degrees C, in the span of minutes, reflecting the operation of the International Space Station (ISS) internal thermal control and cabin system. This paper presents an initial investigation of the metabolic response of Chlorella vulgaris to transient environmental temperatures, reflecting temperature ranges and cycling frequency of the ISS cooling loop (+9 degrees C to +27 degrees C, 30 min). The constant 19 degrees C control represented the time-averaged temperature of the cycled condition. Growth and acclimation were observed in both tested conditions through pH, dissolved oxygen, optical density, and photosynthetic quantum yield measurements. However, there was significant reduction in the oxygen production rate, measured pH, and optical density for the cycled temperature condition when compared to the control (cycled temperature = 0.95 gO(2) L-1 d(-1), pH = 6.75, OD = 0.05; control = 1.17 gO(2) L(-1)d(-1), pH = 8.20, OD = 0.08). No significant reduction in growth rate or photosynthetic quantum yield were recorded between the two tested conditions. Growth rate of the cycled temperature condition reflected those of psychrotolerant algae, suggesting some amount of culture acclimation to the rapidly dynamic environment. Results suggest that while C. vulgaris was viable within the tested temperature environment reflecting the ISS thermal control loop and cabin, there was a measurable reduction in the oxygen production rate.","[Matula, Emily E.; Nabity, James A.] Univ Colorado, Aerosp Engn Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Matula, Emily E.] 2007 Shore Breeze Dr, Pearland, TX 77584 USA","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder","Matula, EE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Aerosp Engn Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.;Matula, EE (corresponding author), 2007 Shore Breeze Dr, Pearland, TX 77584 USA.","emily.matula@colorado.edu; james.nabity@colorado.edu","Nabity, James A/L-5042-2019","Nabity, James A/0000-0002-8427-5735; Matula, Emily/0000-0001-5703-7435","NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship, United States [NNX15AP52H]","NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship, United States","This work was funded by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship, United States [NNX15AP52H].",NA,"83","1","1","1","4","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0094-5765","1879-2030","","ACTA ASTRONAUT","Acta Astronaut.","OCT","2021","187","","",NA,"",NA,"406","415","","10.1016/j.actaastro.2021.07.003","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2021.07.003","","JUL 2021","10","Engineering, Aerospace","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Engineering","UC0II",NA,"Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000686218700039","View Full Record in Web of Science"

To function effectively, the pathogens of these pests must be capable of infecting and developing disease at a wide range of temperatures. The current study examines ten Metarhizium spp. isolates as to their ability to recover normal metabolic activity after exposure to high temperature for several hours daily; and whether such recovery, with at least some isolates, requires a temporary repair (retooling) period. Fungal colonies were exposed to 40 degrees C for 4 h or 8 h followed by 20 h or 16 h at 28 degrees C, respectively, for three consecutive days. Growth rates during treatments were compared to control plates (constant 28 degrees C) and to plates with growth stoppage by cold treatment (4 h or 8 h at 5 degrees C per day). All ten isolates survived 3 days of cycled heat treatment and resumed normal growth afterward; some isolates however, were considerably more negatively affected by heat-cycling than others. In fact, some isolates underwent greatly reduced growth not only during 8 h heating, but also some hours after cessation of heat treatment. This phenomenon is labeled in the current study as post-stress growth delay (P5GD). In contrast, all isolates stopped growing during 8 h cold treatments, but immediately recommenced growing on return to 28 degrees C. The delay in recommencing growth of some isolates after heat treatment amplifies the effect of this stress. In addition to the studies on the effects of heat cycling on fungal cultures, the effects of imposing such temperature cycling on fungal infection of insects was documented in the laboratory. Three Metarhizium isolates were bioassayed using Galleria mellonella larvae. Treated insects were placed at daily temperature regimes matching those used for the in vitro fungus rate-of-growth study, and insect mortality recorded daily. For all three isolates the levels of insect mortality at the highest-heat dose (40 degrees C at 8 h daily) significantly reduced infection. Fluctuating temperatures are likely to be a factor in most pest insect habitats; therefore, the presence and level of PSGD of each isolate should be a primary consideration in selecting field-appropriate fungal isolates.

A fluctuating temperature profile around a mean of 26 degrees C can alter Aedes aegypti vector competence for dengue viruses as well as numerous life-history traits, however, the effect of fluctuations on mosquitoes at critical thermal limits is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the effects of large and small daily temperature fluctuations at low (16 degrees C) and high (35-37 degrees C) mean temperatures, after we identified these temperatures as being thresholds for immature development and/or adult reproduction under constant temperature conditions. We found that temperature effects on larval development time, larval survival and adult reproduction depend on the combination of mean temperature and magnitude of fluctuations. Importantly, observed degree-day estimates for mosquito development under fluctuating temperature profiles depart significantly (around 10-20%) from that predicted by constant temperatures of the same mean. At low mean temperatures, fluctuations reduce the thermal energy required to reach pupation relative to constant temperature, whereas at high mean temperatures additional thermal energy is required to complete development. A stage-structured model based on these empirical data predicts that fluctuations can significantly affect the intrinsic growth rate of mosquito populations. Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that by using constant temperatures, one could under- or over-estimate values for numerous life-history traits compared to more natural field conditions dependent upon the mean temperature. This complexity may in turn reduce the accuracy of population dynamics modeling and downstream applications for mosquito surveillance and disease prevention.","[Carrington, Lauren B.; Armijos, M.

The most important parameter estimated by the SSI model is the intrinsic optimum temperature (T-Phi), which is the temperature at which the probability of an enzyme being in its active state is maximal. It has been also suggested that T-Phi authentically represents the optimal ambient temperature for fitness in ectotherms. We applied the SSI model to larvae of four aquatic decapod crustacean species distributed in cold, temperate, and tropical waters for understanding thermal adaptation in decapods. As a result, T-Phi's estimates for the larvae corresponded to the optimum temperatures for larval survival/growth. The estimates also changed in accordance with the geographical distribution of the stages, species, and populations studied, i.e., 6.91-9.06 degrees C for cold-water species and 19.68-27.00 degrees C for temperate and tropical species. It would be useful to examine the relationship between changes in geographical distribution with temperature T-Phi and population size for a better understanding of population fluctuations under global climate change. Additionally, stable aquaculture production could be enhanced if the temperature conditions of each life history stage were controlled at T-Phi.","[Yamamoto, Takeo] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Japan Sea Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Obama Lab, Obama, Fukui 9170117, Japan; [Jinbo, Tadao] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Aquaculture, Shibushi Lab, Kagoshima 8997101, Japan; [Hamasaki, Katsuyuki] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088477, Japan","Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Tokyo University of Marine Science & Technology","Yamamoto, T (corresponding author), Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Japan Sea Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Obama Lab, Obama, Fukui 9170117, Japan.","takeoy@affrc.go.jp","","Yamamoto, Takeo/0000-0002-0872-4260","","","",NA,"50","15","15","2","14","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0278-0372","1937-240X","","J CRUSTACEAN BIOL","J.

Thus, variation of P uptake parameters was evaluated with a series of depletion studies for poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) and marigold (Tagetes patula) under fluctuating climatic conditions and different developmental stages. Relative growth rate (RGR) of marigold was higher than that of poinsettia and declined for both crops with plant age. Lower air temperature reduced the RGR of poinsettia, but not of marigold. However, the lower light intensity reduced the RGR of marigold while it had no effect on the RGR of poinsettia. A short photoperiod reduced the RGR of poinsettia. Maximum uptake rate also decreased with plant age and with decrease of air temperature for both poinsettia and marigold; however, it was independent of light intensity. Maximum uptake rate of poinsettia was lower during short photoperiod than that of longer photoperiod. A close correlation between RGR and I(max) was observed with both poinsettia and marigold throughout all treatments. The K(m) and C(min) were affected neither by plant age, air temperature, light intensity nor by day length. However, higher I(max), but lower K(m) and C(min) values were observed for marigold than for poinsettia during all treatments. The required P availability in the substrate was not much affected by short term fluctuations of growing conditions and photoperiod. However, it was clearly reduced with plant age for both crops which should be considered for fertilization. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The present research investigated inhibitory effect of diuron on growth and photosynthetic activity of a green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata at five different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 A degrees C) for 144 h of exposure. As a result, effective diuron concentrations at which a 50 % decrease in algal growth occurred was increased with increasing water temperature ranging from 9.2 to 20.1 mu g L-1 for 72 h and 9.4-28.5 mu g L-1 for 144 h. The photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (F (v)/F (m) ratio) was significantly reduced at all temperatures by diuron exposure at 32 mu g L-1 after 72 h. Inhibition rates was significantly increased with decreased water temperature (P < 0.01). Intracellular H2O2 levels as an indicator of oxidative stress were also decreased with increasing temperature in both control and diuron treatment groups and were about 2.5 times higher in diuron treatment groups than that of controls (P < 0.01). Our results suggest water temperatures may affect the toxicokinetics of diuron in freshwater and should therefore be considered in environmental risk assessment.","[Tasmin, Rumana; Shimasaki, Yohei; Qiu, Xuchun; Khalil, Fatma; Kang, Ik-Joon; Oshima, Yuji] Kyushu Univ, Lab Marine Environm Sci, Fac Agr, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Tsuyama, Michito] Kyushu Univ, Lab Silviculture, Fac Agr, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Okino, Nozomu] Kyushu Univ, Lab Marine Resource Chem, Fac Agr, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Yamada, Naotaka] Kyushu Univ, Lab Pesticide Chem, Fac Agr, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Fukuda, Shinji] Kyushu Univ, Lab Water Environm Engn, Fac Agr, Higashi Ku, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan","Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Kyushu University; Kyushu University","Shimasaki, Y (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Lab Marine Environm Sci, Fac Agr, Higashi Ku, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.","simasaki@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp","Qiu, Xuchun/I-5122-2019; Qiu, Xuchun/M-7832-2015; Fukuda, Shinji/A-4517-2015; Tasmin, Rumana/AAI-9158-2020; Okino, Nozomu/AAY-2635-2021","Qiu, Xuchun/0000-0002-1974-1824; Fukuda, Shinji/0000-0003-3076-4688; xiong zhi, da dao/0000-0002-7682-9611","Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Japan; JSPS; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [12F02405] Funding Source: KAKEN","Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Japan; JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The cost of publication was supported in part by the Research Grant for Young Investigators of the Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Japan.

Developmental times at constant temperatures tended to be shorter above 25-30-degrees-C temperature range and longer below this range, than at fluctuating temperatures with the same means. Differences between developmental times at constant temperatures and those at fluctuating temperatures also tended to increase with the amplitude of fluctuating temperatures. Different methods were compared for predicting insect developmental times at fluctuating temperatures. One method made predictions by integrating constant temperature developmental time data over the 24-h fluctuating temperature cycle. This adjusts for the nonlinear relationship between temperature and developmental time. After making this adjustment, predictions were > 40% closer on average to observed developmental times at fluctuating temperatures. With developmental time data collected at fluctuating temperatures, temperature-development equations can be fitted over a broader range of temperatures above and below those favorable for survival of insects at constant temperatures. When these equations were used to do integration, predictions of developmental times at fluctuating temperatures were even better, improving by almost-equal-to 70%. Improvement may be a result partially of consideration of both the means and amplitudes of fluctuating temperatures in predicting developmental times. These methods provide an alternative to degree-day accumulation method for prediction of developmental times at fluctuating temperatures in the field.","","","HAGSTRUM, DW (corresponding author), USDA ARS, N CENT REG, US GRAIN MKT RES LAB, MANHATTAN, KS 66502 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"54","112","116","1","51","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","0013-8746","1938-2901","","ANN ENTOMOL SOC AM","Ann.

Using blue mussels, Mytilus spp., a globally important and well-studied species, we provide empirical evidence supporting that (i) extremely warm (future) summer conditions may select rare recruits that are more capable of expressing metabolic (feeding and respiration) suppression and recovery in response to daily thermal fluctuations in mild to critical temperature range, (ii) this higher heat tolerance can be mediated by lower baseline metabolic demand, possibly decreasing the risks of heat-induced supply and demand mismatch and its associated stress during thermal fluctuations, and (iii) the capacity to acquire such heat tolerance through acclimation is minor. We discuss our results, methodological limitations and offer a perspective for future research. Further evaluation of mechanistic hypotheses such as the one tested here (based on the role of metabolic demand) is needed to generalize the significance of drivers of fast warm adaptation in ectothermic metazoan populations.","[Vajedsamiei, Jahangir; Wahl, Martin; Schmidt, Andrea Lee] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dept Marine Ecol, Kiel, Germany; [Yazdanpanahan, Maryam] Shahid Beheshti Univ, Fac Life Sci & Biotechnol, Tehran, Iran; [Pansch, Christian] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, Finland","Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Shahid Beheshti University; Abo Akademi University","Vajedsamiei, J (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Dept Marine Ecol, Kiel, Germany.","jahangir.vajedsamiei@gmail.com","Pansch, Christian/I-9170-2012","Pansch, Christian/0000-0001-8442-4502; Vajedsamiei, Jahangir/0000-0002-8625-4719","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) project: The neglected role of environmental fluctuations as a modulator of stress and driver of rapid evolution [PA 2643/2/348431475]; GEOMAR; EU project Aquacosm [731065]; Cluster of Excellence The Future Ocean; postdoc program of the Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft Deutscher Forschungszentren","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) project: The neglected role of environmental fluctuations as a modulator of stress and driver of rapid evolution(German Research Foundation (DFG)); GEOMAR; EU project Aquacosm; Cluster of Excellence The Future Ocean; postdoc program of the Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft Deutscher Forschungszentren","This work and JV were funded through the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) project: The neglected role of environmental fluctuations as a modulator of stress and driver of rapid evolution (Grant Number: PA 2643/2/348431475) and through GEOMAR.

The effects of plant density on growth, yield, and yield components of L. fendleri were studied in central Arizona at plant populations of 250000, 500000, 750000, 1000000, and un-thinned controls of 1658000 plants/ha in 1992-1993 and 1500000 plants/ha in 1993-1994. In the 1992-1993 tests, increasing density resulted in a significant decrease in plant width and number of branches, while causing an increase in taproot length in populations up to 750000 plants/ha. There were no effects on seed size; however, density significantly reduced the number of seeds/silique for the 750000 and 1658000 plants/ha treatments. Seed yield/plant and harvest index/plant were significantly reduced with increasing density, but yield/ha increased with density up to 1000000 plants/ha. At 1658000 plants/ha, shattering was excessive and resulted in loss of seeds. The greatest seed yields/ha were obtained at 750000 plants/ha and 1000000 plants/ha densities. The oil content did not vary significantly from 500000 to 1658000 plants/ha, but treatments in this range produced seeds with significantly higher oil content than the 250000 plants/ha treatment. Differences in oil yield/ha reflected differences in seed yield/ha. The 1993-1994 harvest did not show significant differences for seed and oil yields among density treatments. Higher temperatures in 1993-1994 were believed to increase the oil content and seed yield in the higher plant densities. Plant densities of 750000 and 1000000 plants/ha are recommended for lesquerella growing areas comparable to central Arizona. At these densities, maximum seed yields should be obtained even with annual temperature fluctuations. Also, maximum plant heights were obtained at these densities, minimizing seed loses during combine harvest. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The red alga Gracilaria vermiculophylla originates from the NW Pacific but has recently spread along the coastlines of Western Europe, where it has become abundant in many shallow, soft-bottom estuaries. Salinity is important for the local and regional distribution of algae. The distribution of G. vermiculophylla in Europe suggests that it thrives well in hyposaline environments and that it may be more fit than some native algae under such conditions. Little, however, is known about the ecophysiology of G. vermiculophylla and it is therefore difficult to predict its spread and future distribution. Laboratory experiments with G. vermiculophylla showed that steady-state salinity above 15 psu was optimal for growth and that the growth rate was reduced at salinities below 15 psu. Variable salinity reduced the growth rate and larger oscillations were more stressful than small ones. Exposure to very low salinity (0-5 psu) was stressful for the alga and algae exposed to these low levels for 2-4 days were unable to recover fully. Gracilaria vermiculophylla did not seem to perform better in hyposaline conditions than many native, estuarine species. The present distribution of G. vermiculophylla in Scandinavia can be explained well by its response to salinity, but this may not explain its present success relative to many naturally occurring algal species.","[Nejrup, Lars Brammer; Pedersen, Morten Foldager] Roskilde Univ, CIPE, Dept Environm Social & Spatial Change ENSPAC, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark","Roskilde University","Pedersen, MF (corresponding author), Roskilde Univ, CIPE, Dept Environm Social & Spatial Change ENSPAC, Univ Vej 1, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark.","mfp@ruc.dk","","","CIPE [272-05-0161]; Danish Natural Sciences Research Council [272-08-0577]","CIPE; Danish Natural Sciences Research Council(Danish Natural Science Research Council)","PhD-student Lars B.

I tested the hypothesis that upwelling-related variation in water temperature regulates the feeding, growth, and energetics of two rocky intertidal predators, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus (Brandt, 1835) and the whelk Nucella canaliculata (Duclos, 1832). Sea stars and whelks were maintained in laboratory tanks at a constant 9 degreesC, a constant 12 degreesC, and a treatment that simulated the Oregon coast upwelling regime by cycling between 14-day periods of 12 and 9 degreesC. Early in the experiments, sea stars and whelks held at 9 degreesC consumed about 30% fewer mussels (Mytilus trossulus) than those in warmer tanks. Despite lower consumption by whelks in colder tanks, 9 and 12 degreesC individuals attained the same final size. Similarly, sea stars in 9 degreesC tanks showed greater growth per gram of mussel tissue consumed than individuals held at 12 degreesC. These results suggest that reduced consumption under colder conditions was balanced by reduced metabolic costs. Moreover, there appeared to be an energetic advantage to living in the temperature regime characteristic of intermittent upwelling. Sea stars alternately exposed to 12 and 9 degreesC had a significantly higher growth rate, conversion efficiency, and storage of reserves in the pyloric caeca than individuals in the constant 12 degreesC tanks. Whelks maintained under fluctuating temperatures tended to grow faster than those held at constant 12 or 9 degreesC, although this trend was not statistically significant (p=0.069). These results suggest that benthic consumers experiencing cyclic temperatures may feed intensely during periods of warmer water while benefiting from reduced metabolic costs during cold-water intrusions. Because the fecundity of Pisaster and Nucella is a function of energy stored during the upwelling season, interannual variability in upwelling patterns could alter the reproductive output of these species.

Coolant water discharged from coastal nuclear power-generating and coal-powered plants, coupled with already increasing seawater temperatures, can adversely affect local fish communities. A sudden drop in temperature caused by the winter shutdown of power plants can also affect fish health and behavior. To assess the effects of temperature change on fish populations, we subjected early life stages of the once commercially important large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) to various water temperature experiments. Fertilized eggs showed the highest hatching rate at 23.4 degrees C and the lowest rate of deformity in hatched larvae at 23.0 degrees C. We determined the incipient lethal temperature for each life stages using derivation models. Ranges between the upper and lower incipient lethal temperatures increased during development from yolk-sac larvae to juveniles, especially in response to cold shock, indicating that later developmental stages in this species are more tolerant of temperature fluctuations. However, thermal tolerance is not solely determined by life stage. Our results suggest that rapid changes in seawater temperature caused by power plant coolant water discharges may significantly affect early developmental stages of fish. Critical thermal maximum tests indicate that the seawater heating rate is significantly negatively correlated with survival time and affects the critical thermal maximum value of L. crocea. On the basis of our determination of incipient lethal temperatures, emergency measures could be taken to avoid adverse economic and ecological impacts due to changes in seawater temperature caused by coolant water discharges.","[Tian, Sujie; Liao, Yibo; Tang, Yanbin; Liu, Qinghe; Zhang, Rongliang; Shou, Lu; Zeng, Jiangning] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, Key Lab Marine Ecosyst Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Konglin] Minjiang Univ, Fuzhou Inst Oceanog, Fujian Key Lab Conservat & Sustainable Utilizat Ma, Fuzhou, Peoples R China","Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Minjiang University","Liao, YB (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 2, Key Lab Marine Ecosyst Dynam, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.","liaoyb@sio.org.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41706125]; Scientific Research Fund of the Second Institute of Oceanography, MNR, China [JG2209, JG1914]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Scientific Research Fund of the Second Institute of Oceanography, MNR, China","The present work was supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41706125) and the Scientific Research Fund of the Second Institute of Oceanography, MNR, China (JG2209 and JG1914).",NA,"61","0","0","6","6","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

The extension is a seasonal forcing of the phytoplankton growth rate driven by an oscillating temperature via a Q(10) law.

Developing sound agronomic practices.for its production is key to optimizing its seed oil yield potential. Plant stand establishment of camelina has been problematic in some environments, which may be related to its small seed size and current recommendation for shallow sowing. Shallow sowing, can diminish seed to soil contact and expose seeds to large soil temperature and moisture fluctuations, which greatly affect germination and seedling emergence. A study was conducted in 2011 and 2012 on a Barnes loam soil in western Minnesota to examine the effects of sowing spring camelina at soil depths of 1, 2, and 4cm at sowing rates of 2, 3, and 6 kg ha(-1). Seedling emergence increased with sowing rate, but averaged across depths it had no effect on seed yield. Seedling emergence between the 1 and 2 cm sowing depths did not differ in 2012, while stands were reduced by an average of 29% at the 2 cm depth in 2011, but seed yields did not differ between the two sowing depths in either year. However, averaged across sowing rates, sowing at 4cm led to a 64% stand reduction and a significant 22%loss of yield compared with the 1 and 2 cm depths. Neither sowing depth nor rate affected seed oil content or harvest index. Results show that camelina has exceptional yield compensation capacity at low plant densities and can be sown deeper than commonly recommended (i.e., < 1.0 cm) without compromising yield in the northern Corn Belt. Sowing to a depth of 2 cm may be beneficial for certain soils prone to large temperature and moisture fluctuations. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Gesch, R. W.; Dose, H.

Microclimate, root and shoot biomass, photosynthetic gas exchange, and soil/plant water relations were measured under different root-zone temperatures in the field and glasshouse. Carbon gain at midsummer decreased markedly for plants in 35-50degreesC vs c. 30degreesC soils, due to foliar necrosis and stomatal constraints to photosynthesis. Daily rates of dehydration, estimated from changes in leaf water potential, were also 30% greater for plants in the warmer soils. Soil water, evapotranspiration, and ratios of root : shoot biomass and area could not explain greater plant dehydration in warmer soils.

The model approach was based on Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory and details the acquisition and allocation of energy (J d(-1)) during an organisms' full life-cycle. Model calibration was achieved using biometric data collected from the Gulf of Lions between 2002 and 2011. Bioenergetics simulations successfully captured ontogenetic and seasonal growth patterns, including active growth in spring/summer, loss of mass in autumn/winter and the timing and amplitude of multi-batch spawning events. Scenario analysis determined that vital rates (growth and fecundity) were highly sensitive to short-term environmental changes. The DEB model provided a robust foundation for the implementation of an individual-based population model (IBM) in which we used to test the responses of intrinsic and density-independent population growth rates (r) to observed and projected environmental variability. IBM projections estimate that r could be reduced by as much as 15% (relative to that estimated under mean conditions) due to either a 5% (0.8 degrees C) drop in temperature (due to a reduced spawning duration), a 18% (25 mg zooplankton m(-3)) depletion in food supply, a 30% increase in egg mortality rates, or with the phytoplankton bloom peaking 5 weeks earlier (in late-February/Winter). The sensitivity of r to short-term (1 year) and long-term (4-10 year) environmental changes were similar, highlighting the importance of first-year spawners.

During the turmeric culture, the fluctuations of precipitation and seasonal changes in the whole life cycle play a major role, especially water shortage and decreasing temperature (in winter season), leading to rhizome dormancy under extreme weather conditions. The objective of this investigation was to understand how the water deficit and reduced temperature affect turmeric growth, physiological adaptation, quantity, and quality of turmeric rhizomes. Four-month-old turmeric plants were subjected to four treatments, namely normal temperature and well-watered (RT-WW), or water-deficit (RT-WD) conditions in the greenhouse, 25 degrees C controlled temperature and well-watered (CT-WW), or water-deficit (CT-WD) conditions in glasshouse. Leaf osmotic potential considerably declined in 30 days CT-WD treatment, leading to chlorophyll degradation by 26.04%, diminution of maximum quantum yield of PSII (F-v/F-m) by 23.50%, photon yield of PSII (phi(PSII)) by 29.01%, and reduction of net photosynthetic rate (P-n) by 89.39% over CT-WW (control). After 30 days water withholding, fresh- and dry-weights of rhizomes of turmeric plants grown under CT-WD declined by 30-50% when compared with RT-WW conditions. Subsequently, curcuminoid content was reduced by 40% over RT-WW plants (control), whereas transcriptional expression levels of curcuminoids-related genes (CURS1, CURS2, CURS3, and DCS) were upregulated in CT-WD conditions. In summary, the water withholding and controlled temperature (constant at 25 degrees C day/night) negatively affected turmeric plants as abiotic stresses tend to limit overall plant growth performances and curcuminoid yield.","[Chintakovid, Nutwadee; Tisarum, Rujira; Samphumphuang, Thapanee; Sotesaritkul, Thanyaporn; Cha-um, Suriyan] Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy NSTDA, Natl Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol BIOTEC, 113 Thailand Sci Pk,Paholyothin Rd, Khlong Luang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand","National Science & Technology Development Agency - Thailand; National Center Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (BIOTEC)","Cha-um, S (corresponding author), Natl Sci & Technol Dev Agcy NSTDA, Natl Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol BIOTEC, 113 Thailand Sci Pk,Paholyothin Rd, Khlong Luang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand.","suriyanc@biotec.or.th","","Cha-um, Suriyan/0000-0002-7662-363X","National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA) [P-18-529840]","National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)","This work was sponsored by the National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA; grant number P-18-529840).",NA,"82","3","3","2","11","SPRINGER WIEN","WIEN","SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA","0033-183X","1615-6102","","PROTOPLASMA","Protoplasma","MAR","2022","259","2","",NA,"",NA,"301","315","","10.1007/s00709-021-01670-w","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-021-01670-w","","MAY 2021","15","Plant Sciences; Cell Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences; Cell Biology","ZE7GM","34023960","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000652958700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In the field, the optimal growth temperature of S. lividus was found to be 57 degrees C. Such a finding was congruent with the growth rate in the laboratory culture, in which the optimal growth temperatures ranged from 45 to 60 degrees C. In photosynthetic performance, the light-saturated maximum relative electron transport rate (ETRmax) and the light-limited slope (alpha(ETR)) exhibited highest values at 50 degrees C. At five different pH conditions, higher ETRmax and alpha(ETR) were observed from pH 7 to 9. In addition, regression analysis demonstrated a significant positive relationship between the growth rate and the ETRmax values (R-2 = 0.9527), indicating that the growth of S. lividus was largely restricted to its photosynthetic performance. In conclusion, the photosynthetic performance and growth of the thermophilic cyanobacterium S. lividus were sensitive to fluctuations in temperature but not in pH.

This conclusion was drawn from a number of studies having widely different exposure scenarios. Here we have examined the effects of preexposure acclimation conditions (photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), UVR, and temperature) on the growth of four Symbiodinium isolates exposed to elevated temperature and UVR combination. The type A2 isolate was the least sensitive to temperature and UVR stress. Preexposure to elevated temperature led to decreased sensitivity to sublethal temperature exposure for one of the three type B1 isolates (B64). For isolate JR22 preexposure to elevated temperature resulted in greater sensitivity to UVR whereas preexposure to elevated temperature plus UVR decreased sensitivity to UVR exposure. For three of the isolates (JR02F1, B146 and JR22) acclimation did not markedly reduce the impacts of either temperature or UVR. For the three isolates JR02F1, B64, and B146 where LL (PAR; 90 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) and HL (PAR; 700 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) acclimated cultures were compared little or no effect of light level was observed in subsequent exposures to temperature and UVR stress. Our results suggest that thermal or UVR stress history, in the context of the coral reef environment, may reduce coral bleaching at sublethal temperatures and UVR levels, but may or may not enhance coral survival near the upper thermal limit for coral lethality.","[Rogers, John E.; Marcovich, Dragoslav T.; Jordan, Stephen J.; Gallaher, Stacy N.] US EPA, Gulf Ecol Div, Natl Hlth Effects & Environm Res Lab, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA","United States Environmental Protection Agency","Rogers, JE (corresponding author), US EPA, Gulf Ecol Div, Natl Hlth Effects & Environm Res Lab, 1 Sabine Isl Dr, Gulf Breeze, FL 32561 USA.","Rogers.Johne@epa.gov","","","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(United States Environmental Protection Agency)","We thank G.

These tests are valuable for a quick assessment of different steels and alloys. However, in reality steam power plants operate at varying temperatures due to changing demands (day/night, summer/winter, outages, etc). Therefore, it is advantageous necessary to test materials in operating power plants. In the past, this was done for a large variety of materials, but often it is not possible to compare these results to those of lab tests. The exposure time was up to about 5,000 h in lab tests and about 16,000 h in power plant tests. In the present study a method was developed, that allows determination of rate constants for the growth of oxide scales when temperatures are fluctuating. It was found that martensitic steels yield similar results in lab and in plant tests, i.e., steam pressure and steam velocity do not influence scale growth. In contrast, Ni-base alloys show considerable higher oxidation rates in plant tests than in lab tests. The reason for this behaviour is not yet clear and has to be investigated further.","[Knoedler, Reinhard; Straub, Stefan] Alstom Power GmbH, Mannheim, Germany","Alstom","Knodler, R (corresponding author), Alstom Power GmbH, Mannheim, Germany.","reinhard.knoedler@power.alstom.com","","","german Ministerium fur Wirtschaft und Industrie","german Ministerium fur Wirtschaft und Industrie","These investigations were funded partly by the german Ministerium fur Wirtschaft und Industrie.

To address this issue we determined whole-animal fractional rates of protein synthesis (k(s)) in four dominant species of gammarid amphipods with different distributions along the coasts of Western Europe from arctic to temperate latitudes. Up to three populations of each species were collected in the summer and k(s) measured within 48 h. Summer k(s) values were relatively high in the temperate species, Gammarus locusta, from Portugal (48 degrees N) and Wales (53 degrees N) and were maintained across latitudes by the conservation of translational efficiency. In sharp contrast, summer k(s). remained remarkably low in the boreal/temperate species G. duebeni from Wales, Scotland (58 degrees N) and Tromso (70 degrees N), probably as a temporary energy saving strategy to ensure survival in rapidly fluctuating environments of the high intertidal. Values for k(s) increased in acclimated G. duebeni from Scotland and Tromso showing a lack of compensation with latitude. In the subarctic/boreal species, G. oceanicus, summer k(s) remained unchanged in Scotland and Tromso but fell significantly in Svalbard (79 degrees N) at 5 degrees C, despite a slight increase in RNA content. At 79 degrees N, mean k(s) was 4.5 times higher in the circumpolar species G. setosus than in G. oceanicus due to a doubling in RNA content. The relationship between whole-animal protein synthesis rates and natural thermal gradients is complex, varies between species and appears to be associated with local temperatures and their variability, as well as changes in other environmental factors.","[Rastrick, Samuel P.

The time elapsed between the addition of phytomers can be represented by the appearance of leaves at each node, or the leaf appearance rate (LAR). The inverse of LAR is the phyllochron, the chronological time or thermal time elapsed between the appearance of successive leaves along a stem. Plant genotype interactions with environment are responsible for the timing of the phyllochron. Temperature is important for the regulation of many plant processes. To what extent temperature regulates the phyllochron of fruit trees is not clear. Furthermore, the correct thermal time scale to employ for determining the phyllochron has yet to be determined. The objective of this study was to develop a growing degree hour (GDH) thermal time scale model for measuring the phyllochron of Prunus persica and to determine if temperature is the primary factor that influences the phyllochron under field conditions. A temperature-controlled growth chamber study was conducted to determine the appropriate temperatures to use in a GDH-based phyllochron model. We developed a model that is linear on both sides of a plateau-shaped optimum. The base temperature was 4 degrees C, the critical or maximum temperature was 40 degrees C and the optimal temperature range spanned 18-32 degrees C. This GDH model was then used to model the phyllochron of proleptic peach shoots of mature grown trees in the field for two years. Even though the GDH model accounted for much of the daily fluctuations in the phyllochron, the phyllochron generally increased as the season progressed in a manner apparently unrelated to seasonal temperature or daily radiation patterns.

Sharp I) were grown in hydroponic culture at root-zone temperatures of 25, 35, and 38 degrees C for 10 days. Cytokinins in the leaves and roots were quantified at day 5 and 10. Zeatin and its riboside were the main cytokinins in the leaves, while the roots contained a considerable amount of isopentenyladenosine besides the above two cytokinins. High root-zone temperatures caused a marked decrease in cytokinin concentrations. The change was gradual at 35 degrees C but very rapid at 38 degrees C, and fluctuated more in the roots than in the leaves. In plants grown at 38 degrees C, cytokinin concentrations in the roots were very low already at day 5; at day 10 both the roots and leaves contained only negligible concentrations of cytokinins. Zeatin riboside was more sensitive to high root-zone temperatures than the other cytokinins in the leaves. Cucumber plants were grown at 38 degrees C for 10 days and treated with 0, 10(-6), 10(-5), and 10(-4) M benzylaminopurine (BAP) to leaves in combination with 0, 10(-6), and 10(-5) M abscisic acid (ABA) treatments to roots. Treatment of roots with 10(-6) M ABA promoted slightly growth of BAP-untreated plants; but 10(-5) M ABA was inhibitory, irresepective of BAP treatments. On the other hand, foliar sprays of BAP at 10(-4) M caused a marked increase in the growth rate of ABA-untreated plants. Lower BAP concentrations had no significant effects. This growth-promoting effect of 10(-4) M BAP sprays to leaves was not observed when the roots were supplied with ABA at either concentrations. The results strongly suggest that inhibition of cytokinin synthesis in the roots and the resultant decrease in endogenous cytokinin concentrations in the leaves are the bases for growth inhibition of cucumber plants at supraoptimal root-zone temperature.","","","Tachibana, S (corresponding author), MIE UNIV, FAC BIORESOURCES, TSU, MIE 514, JAPAN.","","","","","","",NA,"17","6","8","0","1","JAPAN SOC HORTICULTURAL SCI","KYOTO","C/O NAKANISHI PRINTING SHIMODACHIURI OGAWA HIGASHI, KAMIGYO-KU, KYOTO, 602-8048, JAPAN","1882-3351","1880-358X","","J JPN SOC HORTIC SCI","J.

The aim of the present study is to assess whether the growth rate of crops is affected in the specific shade of PVPs. Changes in air, ground and crop temperature can be suspected due to the reduction of incident radiation below the photovoltaic shelter. Soil temperature (5 cm and 25 cm depth), air temperature and humidity, wind speed as well as incident radiations were recorded at hourly time steps in the full sun treatment and in two agrivoltaic systems with different densities of PVPs during three weather seasons (winter, spring and summer). In addition, crop temperatures were monitored on short cycle crops (lettuce and cucumber) and a long cycle crop (durum wheat). The number of leaves was also assessed periodically on the vegetable crops. Mean daily air temperature and humidity were similar in the full sun treatments and in the shaded situations, whatever the climatic season. On the contrary, mean daily soil temperature significantly decreased below the PVPs compared to the full sun treatment. The hourly pattern of crop temperature during daytime (24 h) was affected in the shade. In this experiment, the ratio between crop temperature and incident radiation was higher below the PVPs in the morning. This could be due to a reduction of sensible heat losses by the plants (absence of dew deposit in the early morning or reduced transpiration) in the shade compared to the full sun treatment. However, mean daily crop temperature was found not to change significantly in the shade and the growth rate was similar in all the treatments. Significant differences in the leaf emission rate were measured only during the juvenile phase (three weeks after planting) in lettuces and cucumbers and could result from changes in soil temperature. As a conclusion, this study suggests that little adaptations in cropping practices should be required to switch from an open cropping to an agrivoltaic cropping system and attention should mostly be focused on mitigating light reduction and on selection of plants with a maximal radiation use efficiency in these conditions of fluctuating shade.

As variables, we measured growth, ingestion, and respiration rates (this latter with and without food). The growth rates of O. marina strains plotted as a function of temperature showed maximum values at the maintenance temperature, as expected in a typical unimodal functional response. However, G. dominans showed similar growth rates at 12 and 18 degrees C, and even a marked decrease in growth rates at 25 degrees C, happened to be not significant. G. dominans ingestion rates were not significantly different at all temperatures (although apparently decreased at 25 degrees C), whereas both O. marina strains showed higher ingestion rates at 18 degrees C. The respiration rates of G. dominans were unaffected by temperature, but those of O. marina strains increased with temperature. The specific dynamic action (respiration increase produced by feeding activity) ranged from 2 to 20% of the daily carbon ingestion for all organisms investigated. The calculated energetic budget indicated that the responses to temperature were diverse, even between in strains of the same species. G. dominans maintained similar growth at all temperatures by balancing metabolic gains and losses. In O. marina strains, on the other hand, the decrease in growth rates at the lowest temperature was driven mainly by reduced ingestion rates. However, increased respiration seemed the primary factor affecting the decrease in growth rates at the highest temperature. These results are discussed in the light of previous studies and on its suitability to understand the response of wild organisms to fluctuations in temperature.","[Calbet, Albert; Martinez, Rodrigo Andres; Saiz, Enric; Alcaraz, Miquel] Inst Ciencies Mar, CSIC, Barcelona, Spain; [Martinez, Rodrigo Andres] Inst Fomento Pesquero IFOP, Puerto Moral, Chile","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro Mediterraneo de Investigaciones Marinas y Ambientales (CMIMA); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM); Instituto de Fomento Pesquero (Valparaiso)","Calbet, A (corresponding author), Inst Ciencies Mar, CSIC, Barcelona, Spain.","acalbet@icm.csic.es","Calbet, Albert/A-7779-2008; Saiz, Enric/K-4263-2014","Calbet, Albert/0000-0003-1069-212X; Saiz, Enric/0000-0003-2611-0067","","","",NA,"52","2","2","2","6","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

Toxicity tests with Myriophyllum spicatum are conducted based on working procedures that provide detailed instructions on how to set up the experiment, e.g., which experimental design is necessary to get reproducible and thus comparable results. Approved working procedures are established by analyzing numerous toxicity tests to find a compromise between practical reasons (e.g., acceptable ranges of ambient conditions as they cannot be kept completely constant) and the ability for detecting growth alterations. However, the benefit of each step of a working procedure, e.g., the random repositioning of test beakers, cannot be exactly quantified, although this information might be useful to evaluate working procedures. In this paper, a growth model of M. spicatum was developed and used to assess the impact of temperature and light fluctuations within the standardized setup. It was analyzed how important it is to randomly reassign the location of each plant during laboratory tests to keep differences between the relative growth rates of individual plants low. Moreover, two examples are presented on how modeling can give insight into toxicity testing. Results showed that randomly repositioning of individual plants during an experiment can compensate for fluctuations of light and temperature. A method is presented on how models can be used to improve experimental designs and to quantify their benefits by predicting growth responses.","[Heine, S.; Schaeffer, A.; Preuss, T.

In treatment 2 (T2), temperature swing was 5 degrees C (mild) which had a total variation of 10 degrees C (Tvar-10) with a minimum of 15 degrees C and maximum of 25 C, treatment 3 (T3) had a variation about the mean of 10 degrees C (moderate) with a total variation of 20 degrees C (Tvar-20) with a minimum of 10 degrees C and maximum of 30 degrees C, or 15 degrees C (severe) swings about the mean in treatment 4 (T4) with a diurnal total variation of 30 C (Tvar-30) with a minimum of 5 C and maximum of 35 C. Leaf area and shoot dry weight of plants in the severe treatment were 30% lower than Controls. Root dry weight in the severe treatment was 30% lower than in the mild treatment. Fruits in the moderate and severe treatments were 22% smaller than in the mild treatment. Fruit soluble sugar content was elevated slightly by RZT fluctuation. Shoot concentrations of N, Mg, Fe, B, Zn were not affected by RZT, but there were small differences in concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mn, and Cu. Nutrient uptake of N and Ca were not affected, but P, K and Mg were about 35% less in Tvar-20 and Tvar-30. RZT variation had no effect on chlorophyll content or number of leaves, maximum carboxylation rate, photosynthetic electron transport rate, maximum CO2 assimilation rate, or fluorescence parameters (Fv/Fm and OPSII). There was little effect of RZT on predawn or midday stem water potential (SWP), but the SWP was substantially lowered in the severe treatment at mid -morning when RZT was about 5 C and air vapor pressure deficit was at its daily maximum. We attributed the reduced shoot and root growth to the transient reduction in SWP when RZT was near 5 C. Overall, the consequences of diurnal RZT fluctuations for strawberry production appear to be small if the minimum temperature is above 7 C. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives were to determine the thermal requirements of three cultivars and to observe the extent of genotype x thermal environment interactions throughout the entire growth period. Vegetative growth was found to be almost exclusively time and temperature dependent, varietal differences being largely insignificant. Plant material was found to accumulate four times faster under the warmest C-regime, which was 7 degrees C warmer then the coolest. The C-treatments caused variation in the number and size of lateral shoots and leaves, causing leaf area to be larger at the squaring stage in cool environments but at maturity in warm regimes. Relatively cool nights lowered the position of the first floral or fruiting branch, whereas warm days shortened flowering intervals and thus promoted earliness. However, the effect of temperature in altering the position of the first floral branch seems to be less important than its effect on the shedding of early squares. The effects of fluctuating temperature (V) on vegetative growth and earliness were similar to those from constant temperature environments. Growth and development rates were low in the low minimum V-regimes, especially when the maximum temperature was also low. Temperature variation affected vegetative growth to a greater extent in the early than in the later stages of development. At squaring, leaf area and dry weight were lowest under the regime with the highest minimum and maximum temperatures. Later on, only leaf area at flowering and total dry weight at maturity significantly differed between treatments. High maximum or minimum temperatures produced effects similar to a higher or lower mean temperature, respectively. The low minimum raised the node number of the first floral or fruiting branch, whereas in the case of boil dry weight it acted in the same way as a further drop in temperature, decreasing the weight, regardless of the maximum temperature. Roll period was affected mainly by the temperature variation itself rather by than the type of variation. The inverse of time to a certain stage and the corresponding mean temperature were linearly related and allowed threshold temperatures (T,) and thermal time requirements to be estimated. T-0 = 12 degrees C, except for the initial stage, when it was lower. A cotton growing season cooler on average by only 1 degrees C will considerably delay maturity.","Agr Univ Athens, Dept Land Reclamat & Agr Engn, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; Hellen Cotton Board, GR-17671 Athens, Greece; Univ Nottingham, Sch Biol Sci, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England","Agricultural University of Athens; University of Nottingham","Liakatas, A (corresponding author), Agr Univ Athens, Dept Land Reclamat & Agr Engn, 75 Iera Odos, GR-11855 Athens, Greece.","","","","","","",NA,"30","27","28","0","14","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA","0021-8596","","","J AGR SCI","J.

Thalli were cultured at 15 and 25 degrees C and at low nitrogen (LN) and high nitrogen (HN) availability. Dark respiration and light-saturating photosynthesis were measured as oxygen exchange; the characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence were also assayed. The maximal photochemical yield (F-v/F-m) and maximum relative electron transport rates (rETR(max)) remained stable with moderate fluctuations of temperature (15-30 degrees C) in the short term. However, the values of F-v/F-m and rETR(max) declined with the high temperature (>= 35 degrees C), and such a decline was more accentuated in 15 degrees C- than 25 degrees C-grown algae. Both the rates of photosynthesis and respiration were sensitive to measurement temperature, with the Q(10) values being higher in 25 degrees C-grown algae (HN) than 15 degrees C-grown algae. It appeared that 25 degrees C-grown algae displayed an optimum temperature (T-opt) of 30 degrees C for photosynthesis, while 15 degrees C-grown algae exhibited the T-opt of a range of 20-30 degrees C. When measured at their respective growth temperature, the rates of photosynthesis were significant higher in 25 degrees C-than 15 degrees C-grown algae, while the rates of respiration were identical between 25 degrees C- and 15 degrees C-grown algae. Our results demonstrated that respiration displayed full acclimation; whereas, photosynthesis exhibited partial acclimation to changing growth temperatures in U. conglobata. Consequently, the balance between respiration and gross photosynthesis was re-established by changing growth temperature, with the ratio being lowered with warmer growth temperature. The results also showed that HN availability in culture significantly increased pigments and soluble protein contents and enhanced photosynthesis and respiration. We suggested that the acclimation potential of metabolisms in U. conglobata favored carbon acquisition and net carbon balance with the increasing seawater temperature resulting from climate change and/or increasing N loading from coastal eutrophication.","S China Univ Technol, Coll Environm & Energy, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zou, Dinghui] Minist Educ, Key Lab Pollut Control & Ecosyst Restorat Ind Clu, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gao, Kunshan] Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361005, Fujian, Peoples R China","South China University of Technology; Xiamen University","Zou, DH (corresponding author), S China Univ Technol, Coll Environm & Energy, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","dhzou@scut.edu.cn","gao, kunshan/G-3374-2010","Gao, Kunshan/0000-0001-7365-6332","Chinese 973 Project [2009CB421207]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41276148, 41076094]","Chinese 973 Project(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This study was supported by the Chinese 973 Project (2009CB421207) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41276148 and 41076094).",NA,"47","29","32","3","64","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0031-8884","2330-2968","","PHYCOLOGIA","Phycologia","JAN","2014","53","1","",NA,"",NA,"86","94","","10.2216/13-189.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/13-189.1","","","9","Plant Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology","AD2WY",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000333098400009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Root growth reduction was more severe than leaf growth reduction and the timing of the transient growth reduction coincided with endogenous bursts of jasmonate (JA) and ethylene emissions reported in literature. The reaction of root growth was superimposed by a strong diel variation of root growth, which was caused by the fluctuating temperature to which the plants were exposed. Apart from the observed root growth reaction, other defense-related traits such as increased nicotine concentration, trichome length and density were activated within 72 h after wounding. Further experiments indicated that the response was elicited by fatty acid-amino acid conjugates that are contained in the oral secretions and that JA signalling is crucial for root-shoot communication here.","[Walter, Achim; Hummel, Gregoire M.] Res Ctr Julich, ICG Phytosphere 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich","Walter, A (corresponding author), Res Ctr Julich, ICG Phytosphere 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany.","a.walter@fz-juelich.de","","Walter, Achim/0000-0001-7753-9643","","","",NA,"16","3","3","1","4","TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","1559-2316","1559-2324","","PLANT SIGNAL BEHAV","Plant Signal.

Trade-offs that arise from this migration have already attracted much attention and the cold temperature in the hypolimnion is thought to be the main cost of this behaviour. In this study we additionally looked at the extra costs daphnids have from being exposed to a fluctuating temperature regime (cold during the day and warm during the night) which is less well studied until today. In our experiment Daphnia hyalina Leydig and Daphnia magna Straus either spent 24 h in constant warm water (19 degrees C), 24 h in constant cold water (12 degrees C), or spent 12 h in warm and 12 h in cold water in an alternating way (fluctuating temperature regime). We expected the values of the life history parameters of Daphnia in the fluctuating temperature regime to be exactly halfway between the values of the life history parameters in the warm and cold treatments because the daphnids spent exactly half of the time in warm water, and half of the time in cold water. Concordant with earlier studies our results showed that age at first reproduction and egg development time were reduced at higher temperatures. In the fluctuating temperature regime the values of both parameters were exactly halfway between the values at permanently warm and cold temperature regimes. In contrast, somatic growth was higher at higher temperatures but was lower in the fluctuating temperature regime than expected from the mean somatic growth rate.

The more alkaline the pH of the foliar spray, the lower the g(s) and/or leaf growth rate subsequently measured. The most alkaline pH that was applied corresponds to that measured in sap extracted from shoots of tomato and Forsythia plants experiencing, respectively, soil drying or a relatively high photon flux density (PFD), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and temperature in the leaf microclimate. The negative correlation between PFD/VPD/temperature and g(s) determined in well-watered Forsythia plants exposed to a naturally varying summer microclimate was eliminated by spraying the plants with relatively alkaline but not acidic buffers, providing evidence for a novel pH-based signalling mechanism linking the aerial microclimate with stomatal aperture. Increasing the pH of the foliar spray only reduced g(s) in plants of the abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient flacca mutant of tomato when ABA was simultaneously sprayed onto leaves or injected into stems. In well-watered Forsythia plants exposed to a naturally varying summer microclimate (variable PFD, VPD, and temperature), xylem pH and leaf ABA concentration fluctuated but were positively correlated. Manipulation of foliar apoplastic pH also affected the response of g(s) and leaf growth to ABA injected into stems of intact Forsythia plants. The techniques used here to control physiology and water use in intact growing plants could easily be applied in a horticultural context.","[Wilkinson, Sally; Davies, William J.] Univ Lancaster, Ctr Environm, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England","Lancaster University","Wilkinson, S (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Ctr Environm, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, England.","sally.wilkinson@lancaster.ac.uk","","","","","",NA,"73","61","65","2","31","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0022-0957","","","J EXP BOT","J.

It is known that starch degradation is regulated by the clock in source-limited plants, which degrade their starch in a linear manner such that it is almost but not completely exhausted at dawn. We asked whether this response is maintained under an extreme carbon deficit. Arabidopsis was subjected to a sudden combination of a day of low irradiance, to decrease starch at dusk, and a warm night. Starch was degraded in a linear manner through the night, even though the plants became acutely carbon starved. We conclude that starch degradation is not increased to meet demand in carbon-limited plants. This network property will allow stringent control of starch turnover in a fluctuating environment. In contrast, in sink-limited plants, which do not completely mobilize their starch during the night, starch degradation was accelerated in warm nights to meet the increased demand for maintenance and growth. Across all conditions, the rate of growth at night depends on the rate of starch degradation, whereas the rate of maintenance respiration decreases only when starch degradation is very slow. The impact of demand on the rate of starch breakdown was compared in source- and sink-limited Arabidopsis plants. In source-limited plants the rate of starch breakdown is paced by the clock such that starch is almost but not completely exhausted at dawn, and is not increased above this rate to meet demand, even when starch reserves are so low that they do not cover the requirements for maintenance and catabolism is induced early in the night. In sink-limited plants, which do not completely mobilise their starch during the night, starch degradation is accelerated to meet the increased demand for maintenance and growth. The rate of growth at night is closely linked to the rate of starch breakdown, while maintenance respiration is largely independent of starch breakdown except in conditions when carbon reserves are very low.","[Pilkington, Sarah M.; Encke, Beatrice; Krohn, Nicole; Hoehne, Melanie; Stitt, Mark; Pyl, Eva-Theresa] Max Planck Inst Mol Plant Physiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany","Max Planck Society","Stitt, M (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Mol Plant Physiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.","mstitt@mpimp-golm.mpg.de","Stitt, Mark/GVT-1242-2022; Pilkington, Sarah/R-9898-2017","Pilkington, Sarah/0000-0002-0948-5716; Pyl, Eva-Theresa/0000-0002-1495-4660; Stitt, Mark/0000-0002-4900-1763","Max Planck Society; European Commission [245142]","Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre)","We would like to acknowledge Christin Abel for taking great care of the plants.

They depend on the abilities of leaves and silks to expand under fluctuating environmental conditions, so the possibility is raised that they may have a partly common genetic determinism. This possibility was tested in a mapping population which segregates for ASI. Maximum leaf elongation rate per unit thermal time (parameter a) and the slopes of its responses to evaporative demand and soil water status (parameters b and c) were measured in greenhouse and growth chamber experiments, in two series of 120 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) studied in 2004 and 2005 with 33 RILs in common both years. ASI was measured in three and five fields under well-watered conditions and water deficit, respectively. For each RIL, the maximum elongation rate per unit thermal time was reproducible over several experiments in well-watered plants. It was accounted for by five QTLs, among which three co-localized with QTLs of ASI of well-watered plants. The alleles conferring high leaf elongation rate conferred a low ASI (high silk elongation rate). The responses of leaf elongation rate to evaporative demand and to predawn leaf water potential were linear, allowing each RIL to be characterized by the slopes of these response curves. These slopes had three QTLs in common with ASI of plants under water deficit. The allele for leaf growth maintenance was, in all cases, that for shorter ASI (maintained silk elongation rate). By contrast, other regions influencing ASI had no influence on leaf growth. These results may have profound consequences for modelling the genotypexenvironment interaction and for designing drought-tolerant ideotypes.","INRA, AGRO M, UMR 759, Lab Ecophysiol Plantes Stress Environnementaux, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France; CIMMYT, Mexico City 06600, DF, Mexico","INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)","Tardieu, F (corresponding author), INRA, AGRO M, UMR 759, Lab Ecophysiol Plantes Stress Environnementaux, Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier 1, France.","ftardieu@ensam.inra.fr","Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012","WELCKER, Claude/0000-0002-8275-1259; Tardieu, Francois/0000-0002-7287-0094","","","",NA,"41","103","107","4","34","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0022-0957","","","J EXP BOT","J.

Temperatures are increasing globally, but this increase is not symmetrical; instead, night-time minimum air temperatures increase faster than daytime maximum temperatures. However, we still know little about when and how this differential increase in maximum versus minimum air temperatures affects ecological interactions between species. Understanding the connection between different types (night vs. day) of warming and interspecific interactions is essential to predict the ecological consequences of climate change for natural ecosystems. 2. Here we used experiments in a common predator (lady beetle)-prey (aphid) system to examine how night warming, thermal regime (constant vs. fluctuating) and prey density influence demographic rates and per capita feeding rate and thus predation pressure. We mainly focused on the demographic variables and prey consumption as well as energy-related variables of the predators to understand how changes in night-time temperature, temperature regime and prey density affect predator performances and to differentiate these effects between constant and fluctuating thermal conditions. 3. We found that warming effects on most of the individual demographic rates and per capita consumption rates of the predator differed between constant and fluctuating regimes. These differences scaled up to alter population stage structure and population growth rate of the predator and ultimately the predation pressure in our system. Furthermore, warming had stronger and negative consequences on predator population growth and thus predation pressure in constant regime, but little or even positive effects under fluctuating conditions. Importantly, these results are consistent across prey densities. 4. Our results suggest that compared to night warming, predictions based on mean warming can under- or overestimate species demographic rates and per capita predation effects, causing inaccurate or even misleading expectations on population structure, long-term population growth and interspecific interactions. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for both ecologically relevant diurnal temperature cycle and lifelong demographics and per capita consumption when assessing how warming affects interspecific interactions. Our findings thus provide better understanding of how night warming will affect predator-prey interactions and energy flux within trophic cascades and also have implications for predicting the consequences of top-down control in natural and agricultural ecosystems under climate change.","[Ma, Gang; Bai, Chun-Ming; Ma, Chun-Sen] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, State Key Lab Biol Plant Dis & Insect Pests, Inst Plant Protect, Climate Change Biol Res Grp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rudolf, Volker H.

We reasoned that the response to daytime and night temperature may vary; while daytime temperature affects photosynthesis, night temperature affects use of carbon that was accumulated in the light. Three Arabidopsis thaliana accessions were grown in thermocycles under carbon-limiting conditions with different daytime or night temperatures (12 to 24 degrees C) and analyzed for biomass, photosynthesis, respiration, enzyme activities, protein levels, and metabolite levels. The data were used to model carbon allocation and growth rates in the light and dark. Low daytime temperature led to an inhibition of photosynthesis and an even larger inhibition of growth. The inhibition of photosynthesis was partly ameliorated by a general increase in protein content. Low night temperature had no effect on protein content, starch turnover, or growth. In a warm night, there is excess capacity for carbon use. We propose that use of this capacity is restricted by feedback inhibition, which is relaxed at lower night temperature, thus buffering growth against fluctuations in night temperature. As examples, the rate of starch degradation is completely temperature compensated against even sudden changes in temperature, and polysome loading increases when the night temperature is decreased.","[Pyl, Eva-Theresa; Piques, Maria; Ivakov, Alexander; Schulze, Waltraud; Ishihara, Hirofumi; Stitt, Mark; Sulpice, Ronan] Max Planck Inst Mol Plant Physiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany","Max Planck Society","Sulpice, R (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Galway, Ireland.","sulpice@mpimp-golm.mpg.de","Stitt, Mark/GVT-1242-2022; Ivakov, Alexander/C-9691-2015; sulpice, ronan/I-2738-2013; Schulze, Waltraud X/E-9800-2011","Ivakov, Alexander/0000-0003-4091-1135; sulpice, ronan/0000-0002-6113-9570; Schulze, Waltraud X/0000-0001-9957-7245; Ishihara, Hirofumi/0000-0002-7658-0473; Stitt, Mark/0000-0002-4900-1763; Pyl, Eva-Theresa/0000-0002-1495-4660","Max Planck Society; German Ministry for Education and Research [GABI-GNADE 0315060E, GoFORSYS]; European Commission [245143]","Max Planck Society(Max Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX); German Ministry for Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre)","We thank Beatrice Encke and Nicole Krohn for assays of metabolites and enzyme activities, Melanie Hoehne for qRT-PCR assays, and Christin Abel for excellent care of the plants.

Yet for most turtle species, including the estuarine diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), there is limited information on embryonic sensitivity to elevated temperature. We incubated eggs of M. terrapin at three, mean temperatures (31, 34, 37 degrees C) under two thermal exposure regimes (constant or semi-naturally fluctuating temperature) and measured hatching success, developmental rate, and hatchling size. Hatching success was 100% at 31 degrees C and 67% at 34 degrees C, respectively; at 37 degrees C, all eggs failed early in the incubation period. These values were unaffected by exposure regime. The modeled LT50 (temperature that was lethal to 50% of the test population) was 34.0 degrees C in the constant and 34.2 degrees C in the fluctuating thermal regime, reflecting a steep decline in survival between 33 and 35 degrees C. Hatchlings having been incubated at a constant 34 degrees C hatched sooner than those incubated at 31 degrees C under either constant or fluctuating temperature. Hatchlings were smaller in straight carapace length (CL) and width after having been incubated at 34 degrees C compared to 31 degrees C. Larger (CL) hatchlings resulted from fluctuating temperature conditions relative to constant temperature conditions, regardless of mean temperature. Based upon recent temperatures in natural nests, the M. terrapin population studied here appears to possess resiliency to several degrees of elevated mean nest temperatures, beyond which, embryonic mortality will likely sharply increase. When considered within the mosaic of challenges that Maryland's M. terrapin face as the climate warms, including ongoing habitat losses due to sea level rise and impending thermal impacts on bioenergetics and offspring sex ratios, a future increase in embryonic mortality could be a critical factor for a population already experiencing ecological and physiological challenges due to climate change.","[Rowe, Christopher L.; Liang, Dong; Woodland, Ryan J.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Chesapeake Biol Lab, 146 Williams St,POB 38, Solomons, MD 20688 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science","Rowe, CL (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Chesapeake Biol Lab, 146 Williams St,POB 38, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.","Rowe@umces.edu","Liang, Dong/J-3691-2016; Rowe, Christopher L/D-5271-2012; Woodland, Ryan J/D-5344-2017","Liang, Dong/0000-0002-0550-7324; Woodland, Ryan J/0000-0002-3309-3413","Maryland Sea Grant [SA071338101-H]","Maryland Sea Grant","We thank R.

Therefore, seasonal climate fluctuations such as maximum and minimum daily temperature changing and precipitation rates are important for quantity of annual corn production in Mediterranean area. This study was carried out to determination of dry matter, biomass, relative growth rate (RGR) values in eleven phenological stages [4 leaf (V4), 8 leaf (V8), 12 leaf (V12), 16 leaf (V16), tasseling (VT), silking (R1), blister (R2), milk (R3), dough (R4), dent (R5) and maturity (R6)] of corn during the period 2005, 2006 and 2007 in Aydin location, which is characteristically Mediterranean weather condition in Turkey. Additionally, calculated growing degree days (GDD), per ear weight, plant and ear height (cm), blank tip of ear (shriveled remnants of kernels because of ineffective pollination) (cm) were measured throughout the phenological stages. The data of the study is average of 31G98 and 32K61 corn hybrids value. It is seeming that a significantly differences amongst the years which the field study establishment. All properties except to per ear weight were significantly affected to years. Maximum dry matter and biomass values on the phenological stages were measured in 2005. Maximum per ear weight, plant and ear height values were also obtained from the first year of the experiment. However maximum blank tip of ear value was obtained from 2007. It is suggested that three parameters should be used for yield estimating and determination of biomass and dry matter values among phenological stages of corn.

The soil was incubated at 10 degreesC and 12 degreesC, with or without leaf litter and with or without plants present. The purpose of the experiment was to analyse decomposition and nutrient transformations under simulated, realistic conditions in a future warmer Arctic. Both temperature enhancement and litter addition increased respiration rates. Temperature enhancement and surprisingly also litter addition decreased microbial biomass carbon (C) content, resulting in a pronounced increase of specific respiration. Microbial P content increased progressively with temperature enhancement and litter addition, concomitant with increasing P mineralisation, whereas microbial N increased only in the litter treatment, at the same time as net N mineralisation decreased. In contrast, microbial biomass N decreased as temperature increased, resulting in a high mobilisation of inorganic N. Plant responses were closely coupled to the balance of microbial mineralisation and immobilisation. Plant growth and N accumulation was low after litter addition because of high N immobilisation in microbes and low net mineralisation, resulting in plant N limitation. Growth increased in the temperature-enhanced treatments, but was eventually limited by low supply of P, reflected in a low plant P concentration and high N-to-P ratio. Hence, the different microbial responses caused plant N limitation after litter addition and P limitation after temperature enhancement. Although microbial processes determined the main responses in plants, the plants themselves influenced nutrient turnover. With plants present, P mobilisation to the plant plus soil inorganic pools increased significantly, and N mobilisation non- significantly, when litter was added. This was presumably due to increased mineralisation in the rhizosphere, or because the nutrients in addition to being immobilised by microbes also could be absorbed by plants. This suggests that the common method of measuring nutrient mineralisation in soils incubated without plants may underestimate the rates of nutrient mobilisation, which probably contributes to a commonly observed discrepancy of measured lower rates of net nutrient mineralisation than uptake rates in arctic soils.

Seasonal temperature variations as well as more rapid daily fluctuations are liable to modify the growth conditions of microalgae and hence affect production efficiency. The effect of elevated temperatures, above optimal growth temperatures, on growth is seldom reported in literature, but often described as more deleterious than low temperatures. Depending on the species, different strategies are deployed to counteract the effect of above optimal temperatures such as energy re-balancing and cell shrinking. Moreover, long term adaptation of certain species over generation cycles has also been proven efficient to increase optimal temperatures. Physical models coupled to biological kinetics are able to predict the evolution of temperature in the growth media and its effect on the growth rate, highlighting the downstream drastic economic and environmental impacts. Regarding the relative elasticity of microalgae towards temperature issues, cell mortality can depend on species or adapted species and in certain cases can be attenuated. These elements can complement existing models and help visualize the effective impacts of temperature on outdoor cultures.","[Ras, Monique; Steyer, Jean-Philippe] INRA, UR050, Lab Biotechnol Environm, F-11100 Narbonne, France; [Bernard, Olivier] INRIA Sophia Antipolis Mediterranee, BIOCORE, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France","INRAE","Bernard, O (corresponding author), INRIA Sophia Antipolis Mediterranee, BIOCORE, 2004,Route Lucioles,BP 93, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France.","Olivier.bernard@inria.fr","Bernard, Olivier/J-1133-2014","Bernard, Olivier/0000-0003-2539-9014; Steyer, Jean-Philippe/0000-0003-0467-8081","SYMBIOSE research project; French National Research Agency (ANR)","SYMBIOSE research project; French National Research Agency (ANR)(French National Research Agency (ANR))","This work benefited from the support of the SYMBIOSE research project funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).",NA,"70","253","264","20","235","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1569-1705","1572-9826","","REV ENVIRON SCI BIO","Rev.

We assessed whether complete feed restriction prior to (24 degrees C, days 0-23) and/or during (14 degrees C, days 24-114) a simulated period of cold-acclimation could elicit episodes of compensatory growth (CG) and catch-up growth upon warm-up to 24 degrees C and satiation feeding (days 115-148). Control hybrid striped bass (HSB: Morone chrysops Chi Morone saxatilis) were fed to satiation throughout the entire experiment under these temperature fluctuations. Compensatory growth and ultimately catch-up growth were achieved in groups of HSB that were deprived of feed during either the initial period at 24 degrees C (days 0-23), during the cold-acclimation period (14 degrees C, days 24-114), or during both of these periods (days 0-114). Further, it appears that HSB are better able to compensate for weight loss when skeletal length is not significantly compromised during the treatment period, which occurred in HSB feed restricted during cold-acclimation only. The most dramatic CG responses were defined by specific growth rates (SGRs) up to 4.2 times that of controls and were accompanied by hyperphagia and improvements in temporal and overall feed conversion. Levels of plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and muscle IGF-1 mRNA were significantly correlated to growth rate for all groups throughout the experiment (R-2 = 0.40, 0.23, respectively), with an overcompensation of both observed in HSB with the most elevated SGRs during the CG response. Interestingly, opposing trends were observed between muscle mRNA expression of growth hormone receptor (GHR)-1 and -2, with fasting at 24 degrees C and 14 degrees C resulting in depressed levels of GHR-1 and elevated levels of GHR-2 relative to controls. Levels of muscle myostatin (MSTN)-1 mRNA were significantly depressed in HSB fasted at 24 degrees C and/or 14 degrees C while MSTN-2 mRNA was lower following initial feed restriction at 24 degrees C. Likewise, levels of unprocessed pro-MSTN (precursor) and mature MSTN protein were both depressed in fasted fish at 24 degrees C. This study demonstrates that a previous period of feed restriction and cold-acclimation followed by realimentation at more favorable water temperatures produces a strong CG response and catch-up growth in fish. These studies also suggest that an overcompensation of circulating and local IGF-1 along with changes in MSTN mRNA and protein expression may contribute to accelerated growth rates characteristic of CG. Furthermore, our studies indicate that overall feed conversion can improve by as much as 30% with CG induced through temperature and feeding manipulations with no adverse effects on growth of HSB. This raises the possibility that CG protocols can improve production efficiency of HSB and other temperate teleosts in pond or tank culture. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

To investigate which factors operate in the community structure, we explored several physical conditions, such as high inflows, and the biotic dynamics of the main zooplankton groups (i.e., rotifers, cladocerans and copepods). Two extreme flood events occurred during the investigated period and caused dramatic changes in physical conditions and reduction of the planktonic community abundances. The short period between both high-flow events was enough for the recovery of microplankton, but not for the metazoan zooplankton. Our results are in agreement with the common situation in which high flood events commonly favour rotifers over crustaceans, likely due to rotifer species have great colonization ability and grow faster. However, we found that the dominance of rotifers over crustaceans in our system is evidenced by an extremely, unusual high ratio between their abundances. We observed that, at the time of the great floods, crustacean abundances as well as rotifer populations notably decreased until near zero values. Although rotifer abundance began declining before high floods, the decrease was particularly notable when the great flood happened. Our results evidenced that i) dilution rate and temperature were the main drivers which are operating in the structure of the zooplankton community; and ii) no negative biotic interactions were detected between large and small cladocerans and rotifers. Additionally, we found surprisingly that a repeated disturbance caused by high flood events does increase the species diversity of rotifers. Finally, our study also detected some cues which may indicate that diapausing egg bank is also playing an important role in the zooplankton community, favouring the dominance of rotifers; however, this phenomenon deserves further studies.","[Gabaldon, Carmen; Hejzlar, Josef; Simek, Karel; Znachor, Petr; Nedoma, Jiri; Seda, Jaromir] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Biol Ctr, Inst Hydrol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Devetter, Miloslav] Acad Sci Czech Republ, Biol Ctr, Inst Soil Biol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Czech Academy of Sciences; Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Seda, J (corresponding author), Acad Sci Czech Republ, Biol Ctr, Inst Hydrol, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.","seda@hbu.cas.cz","Znachor, Petr/AAC-2289-2021; Devetter, Miloslav/AAE-1676-2021; Hejzlar, Josef/F-8526-2014; Simek, Karel/F-8930-2014; Znachor, Petr/AAH-5088-2020; Hejzlar, Josef/AAE-3963-2020; Šimek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021; Nedoma, Jiri/F-9063-2014; Znachor, Petr/F-8901-2014; Seda, Jaromir/F-9072-2014; Devetter, Miloslav/G-1087-2014; GABALDÓN, CARMEN/N-3245-2017","Znachor, Petr/0000-0002-9356-5996; Devetter, Miloslav/0000-0003-1767-4266; Šimek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Devetter, Miloslav/0000-0003-1767-4266; ","Czech Science Foundation [15-24309S, 13-00243S]","Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic)","This work was supported by the Czech Science Foundation projects 15-24309S and 13-00243S.",NA,"87","9","11","2","22","PAGEPRESS PUBL","PAVIA","MEDITGROUP, VIA G BELLI, 4, PAVIA, 27100, ITALY","1129-5767","1723-8633","","J LIMNOL","J.

We monitored recruitment, growth, and survival of C. fragile, and potential biotic and abiotic factors that regulate these processes in three tidepools at different tidal heights on a wave-exposed rocky shore over 4 y (2000-2003). Large seasonal and interannual fluctuations in population density (up to 520 plants (.) 0.25 m(-2)) were driven by recruitment of small thalli (<= 2 cut length) in summer and subsequent mortality of larger plants in fall and winter. Variation in the timing and magnitude of recruitment among years may reflect differences in the mode of reproduction, with intensive recruitment via dispersing propagules establishing the dense populations that in subsequent years produce new thalli vegetatively. Growth rates of new recruits increased with water temperature between June and September. Survival of marked plants steadily decreased during summer and fall (to <= 20% by November 2001) and was greater in recruits transplanted to deeper and more wave-sheltered microhabitats within pools. Two pools in the low intertidal zone had lower temperatures, greater water movement, and fewer grazers than a third pool high on the shore. These environmental differences may account for variation in growth and survival of C. fragile among pools at different intertidal heights.","Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS, Canada","Dalhousie University","Schmidt, AL (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS, Canada.","aschmidt@dal.ca","","","","","",NA,"42","24","24","0","21","UNIVERSITE LAVAL","ST FOY","PAVILLON CHARLES-EUGENE MARCHAND, LOCAL 0166, ST FOY, QUEBEC G1K 7P4, CANADA","1195-6860","","","ECOSCIENCE","Ecoscience","","2005","12","3","",NA,"",NA,"403","411","","10.2980/i1195-6860-12-3-403.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.2980/i1195-6860-12-3-403.1","","","9","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","974HN",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000232582200013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We addressed these questions using experimental heat waves with larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. The experiments used diurnally fluctuating temperature treatments differing in the number (0-3) and developmental timing (early, middle and/or late in larval development) of heat waves, in which a single heat wave involved three consecutive days with a daily maximum temperature of 42 degrees C. Survival to pupation declined with increasing number of heat waves. Multiple (but not single) heat waves significantly reduced development time and pupal mass; the best models for the data indicated that both the number and developmental timing of heat waves affected performance. In addition, heat waves earlier in development significantly reduced growth and development rates later in larval development.

In winter there is extreme cold and darkness. During summer there is continuous light for some months and plant surface temperatures may fluctuate through more than 50 degrees C diurnally. Conditions are almost uniformly desiccative, except during spring when snow melt saturates thalli and plants may be completely inundated. The study of photosynthesis in these conditions is fundamental to a proper understanding of plant persistence, productivity and growth in polar regions. Lichens dominate the terrestrial vegetation of Antarctica and are therefore of great interest. Lichen photosynthesis has been shown to be dependent upon thallus water content and temperature as well as the irradiance incident on the thallus. Conventional infrared gas analysis (IRGA) techniques have been used most widely to study lichen photosynthesis in both the field and laboratory. Recent progress in the development of pulse amplitude modulated fluorescence systems has allowed the investigation of chlorophyll fluorescence in the field under naturally illuminated conditions. This paper highlights the utility of modulated fluorescence systems for the study of antarctic lichen photosynthesis, relates fluorescence results to those obtained by IRGA techniques, identifies problems inherent in fluorescence analysis of lichens and discusses possible areas of future research.","UNIV TASMANIA,DEPT PLANT SCI,HOBART,TAS 7001,AUSTRALIA","University of Tasmania","HOVENDEN, MJ (corresponding author), AUSTRALIAN ANTARCTIC DIV,CHANNEL HIGHWAY,KINGSTON,TAS 7050,AUSTRALIA.","","Hovenden, Mark J./A-1323-2008","Hovenden, Mark J./0000-0001-7208-9700","","","",NA,"61","10","10","1","10","C S I R O PUBLICATIONS","COLLINGWOOD","150 OXFORD ST, PO BOX 1139, COLLINGWOOD VICTORIA 3066, AUSTRALIA","0310-7841","","","AUST J PLANT PHYSIOL","Aust.

Alterations in the phenology of either consumers or their prey might decouple trophic relationships and reduce consumer growth and survival, and this potential for mismatches is especially pronounced in migratory organisms that change habitats. Juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) migrate from natal streams to lake habitats, and we hypothesised that their in-lake growth and survival depends on whether timing of migration matches suitable lake conditions. We used mixed effects models to test the hypotheses that: (a) the most successful entry times correspond to favourable prey densities and lake thermal conditions; and (b) a mismatch in fish entry time and seasonal lake dynamics can reduce fish growth and survival. These models were applied to an 11-year time series of migration timing, capture rate and size at smolting for juvenile sockeye salmon in Lake Washington, WA, USA. Juvenile sockeye salmon entering Lake Washington later in the season encountered higher zooplankton abundance and warmer water, and experienced higher average rates of growth and survival, but the optimal date for lake entry ranged across years by up to a month. Zooplankton abundance and bloom timing affected fish growth and relative survival more than lake temperature, and survival was most influenced by zooplankton abundance in the spring when fish entered the lake. In contrast, fish size at seaward migration from the lake depended primarily on zooplankton abundance in the spring as they left the lake rather than the previous spring when they entered. These results suggest that maintaining a wide window of lake entry dates allows this population to capture the annually-varying period of favourable conditions, minimising mismatches between juvenile fish and their resources and thereby enabling successful recruitment in an unpredictable environment.","[Hovel, Rachel A.; Litt, Arni H.; Quinn, Thomas P.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Fresh, Kurt L.] NOAA, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA USA; [Schroder, Steven L.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Olympia, WA USA","University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife (WDFW)","Hovel, RA (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Dept Biol, Farmington, ME 04938 USA.","rachel.hovel@maine.edu","","","Mellon Foundation; H.

With its large spectrum of geographical origins and cropping areas, one can credit tropical japonica rice subspecies of a probable genetic diversity of its response to air temperature, which is of major interest for the breeding of better adapted rice varieties. A panel of 195 rice accessions (175 japonica plus 20 reference cultivars) was studied in controlled environment to estimate cardinal (base, optimum, and maximum) temperatures based on the monitoring of the elongation rate (LERmax) of the sixth leaf on the main stem in response to six fixed thermal treatments ranging from 16 to 35 degrees C. A dedicated statistical framework was elaborated for estimating LERmax, cardinal temperature and related uncertainties. Developed statistical framework enhanced the precision of cardinal temperatures estimated compared to previously reported methods, especially for base temperature. Maximum temperature was trickier to estimate and will require further studies. A significant genotypic variability for base and optimal temperature was pointed out, suggesting tropical japonica subspecies represents a relevant genetic pool to breed for rice genotypes adapted to various thermal situations. These results also suggested that using genotype-dependent cardinal temperature values should enhance the way crop growth models account for genotype x environment interactions hence their predictive value in current and future climatic conditions.","[Rouan, Lauriane; Luquet, Delphine; Roques, Sandrine; Dardou, Audrey] CIRAD, UMR AGAP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Rouan, Lauriane; Audebert, Alain; Luquet, Delphine; Roques, Sandrine; Dardou, Audrey] Univ Montpellier, Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, CIRAD,AGAP, Montpellier SupAgro, France; [Audebert, Alain] CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Thies Escale, Senegal; [Goze, Eric] Univ Montpellier, CIRAD, AIDA, Montpellier, France; [Goze, Eric] CIRAD, UPR AIDA, F-34398 Montpellier, France","CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; INRAE; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; CIRAD; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD","Rouan, L (corresponding author), CIRAD, UMR AGAP, F-34398 Montpellier, France.;Rouan, L (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, Montpellier SupAgro, INRA, CIRAD,AGAP, Montpellier SupAgro, France.","lauriane.rouan@cirad.fr","","Goze, Eric/0000-0001-9121-7835","CIRAD thematic action ORYTAGE","CIRAD thematic action ORYTAGE","This work was supported by the CIRAD thematic action ORYTAGE.",NA,"29","4","4","0","4","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1343-943X","1349-1008","","PLANT PROD SCI","Plant.

In this study, the marine red macroalga Gracilaria lemaneiformis was cultured at three different temperatures (12, 19, and 26 degrees C) and at high- and low-nitrogen (N) availability, to investigate the acclimation potential of respiration and photosynthesis to temperature change. Measurements of respiratory and photosynthetic rates were made at five temperatures (7 degrees C33 degrees C). An instantaneous change in temperature resulted in a change in the rates of respiration and photosynthesis, and the temperature sensitivities (i.e., the Q10 value) for both the metabolic processes were lower in 26 degrees C-grown algae than 12 degrees C- or 19 degrees C-grown algae. Both respiration and photosynthesis acclimated to long-term changes in temperature, irrespective of the N availability under which the algae were grown; respiration displayed strong acclimation, whereas photosynthesis only exhibited a partial acclimation response to changing growth temperatures. The ratio of respiration to gross photosynthesis was higher in 12 degrees C-grown algae, but displayed little difference between the algae grown at 19 degrees C and 26 degrees C.

Geographic variation among populations in life history response to temperature mean and variability offers one view of the potential for local adaptation to broaden the thermal niche. We used laboratory growth experiments to examine the effects of temperatures between 13 degrees C and 30 degrees C on five life history traits and the intrinsic rate of increase for 15 Tigriopus californicus populations distributed over 17 degrees of latitude. Different life history stages showed distinct latitudinal shifts in thermal response, while the temperature of peak population growth consistently declined with increasing latitude. In addition, high-latitude populations grew faster at optimal temperatures but showed steeper fitness declines at high temperature. To test geographic population variation in response to the amplitude of daily thermal fluctuations, we grew three northern and three southern populations and manipulated nightly low and daily high temperatures. We found the lowest fitness overall in the treatment with the highest mean temperature, and the treatment with the greatest variability showed high fitness despite an 8 degrees C greater daily range. Population responses to daily thermal variability were unrelated to latitude of origin. Our results indicate that trade-offs between adaptation to high vs. low temperature, and between growth and maturation vs. survival and fecundity, govern local adaptation along the latitudinal gradient. They also indicate that T. californicus populations can maintain fitness over a wide range of daily variability but are more sensitive to small changes in the mean temperature.","[Hong, Brian C.; Shurin, Jonathan B.] Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","University of California System; University of California San Diego","Shurin, JB (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sect Ecol Behav & Evolut, Div Biol Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.","jshurin@ucsd.edu","","Shurin, Jonathan/0000-0001-7870-1972","University of California-San Diego","University of California-San Diego(University of California System)","We thank Chris Neufeld and Akana Noto for their help with copepod sampling.

It could potentially be used as a tracer of N metabolism in plants under changing environmental conditions, where primary N metabolism may be complex, and losses and gains of N fluctuate over time. In order to test the utility of delta N-15 as an indicator of plant N status in N-2-fixing plants grown under various environmental conditions, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) plants were subjected to distinct conditions of [CO2] (400 vs. 700 mu mol mol(-1)), temperature (ambient vs. ambient +4 degrees C) and water availability (fully watered vs. water deficiency-WD). As expected, increased [CO2] and temperature stimulated photosynthetic rates and plant growth, whereas these parameters were negatively affected by WD. The determination of delta N-15 in leaves, stems, roots, and nodules showed that leaves were the most representative organs of the plant response to increased [CO2] and WD. Depletion of heavier N isotopes in plants grown under higher [CO2] and WD conditions reflected decreased transpiration rates, but could also be related to a higher N demand in leaves, as suggested by the decreased leaf N and total soluble protein (TSP) contents detected at 700 mu mol mol(-1) [CO2] and WD conditions. In summary, leaf delta N-15 provides relevant information integrating parameters which condition plant responsiveness (e.g., photosynthesis, TSP, N demand, and water transpiration) to environmental conditions.","[Ariz, Idoia; Cruz, Cristina; Neves, Tome] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Ecol Evolucao & Alteracoes Ambientais, Lisbon, Portugal; [Irigoyen, Juan J.] EEAD, Unidad Asociada CSIC, Dept Biol Ambiental, Grp Fisiol Estres Plantas, Zaragoza, Spain; [Irigoyen, Juan J.] ICVV, Logrono, Spain; [Garcia-Olaverri, Carmen] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Pamplona, Spain; [Nogues, Salvador] Univ Barcelona, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, Barcelona, Spain; [Aparicio-Tejo, Pedro M.] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Ciencias Medio Nat, Pamplona, Spain; [Aranjuelo, Iker] Univ Basque Country, Plant Biol & Ecol Dept, Fac Sci & Technol, Leioa 48940, Spain; [Aranjuelo, Iker] Univ Publ Navarra, CSIC, Gobierno Navarra, Inst Agrobiotecnol IdAB, Mutilva Baja, Spain","Universidade de Lisboa; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental de Aula Dei (EEAD); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-CAR-UR - Instituto de Ciencias de la Vid y del Vino (ICVV); Universidad Publica de Navarra; University of Barcelona; Universidad Publica de Navarra; University of Basque Country; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-GN-UPNA - Instituto de Agrobiotecnologia (IDAB); Universidad Publica de Navarra","Aranjuelo, I (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, Plant Biol & Ecol Dept, Fac Sci & Technol, Leioa 48940, Spain.","iker.aranjuelo@ehu.es","Neves, Tomé/V-3317-2018; Tejo, Pedro M Aparicio/E-9062-2011; Aranjuelo, Iker/N-5635-2019; Aranjuelo, Iker/L-4204-2014; Irigoyen, Juan José/K-8902-2014; Cruz, Cristina/H-7026-2019; nogues, salvador/GYU-6216-2022; Cruz, Cristina/F-2643-2011; ariz, idoia/H-3230-2015; Garcia-Olaverri, Carmen/AAY-7770-2020","Neves, Tomé/0000-0003-3551-8072; Tejo, Pedro M Aparicio/0000-0002-7342-6999; Aranjuelo, Iker/0000-0002-8231-5043; Aranjuelo, Iker/0000-0002-8231-5043; Irigoyen, Juan José/0000-0003-4297-392X; Cruz, Cristina/0000-0003-3100-463X; nogues, salvador/0000-0002-1694-0924; ariz, idoia/0000-0003-3055-5560; GARCIA-OLAVERRI, CARMEN/0000-0003-4910-0822","Spanish Economy and Competiveness ministry (Ramon y Cajal research grant) [AGL-2012-37815-CO5-05, AGL2011-30386-C02-02]; Portuguese FCT [PTDC/BIA-ECS/1122214/2010]; postdoctoral Fellowship from the Government of Navarra (Anabasid outgoing Programme); postdoctoral Fellowship from the Portuguese FCT [SFRH/BPD/90436/2012]","Spanish Economy and Competiveness ministry (Ramon y Cajal research grant)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Portuguese FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); postdoctoral Fellowship from the Government of Navarra (Anabasid outgoing Programme); postdoctoral Fellowship from the Portuguese FCT","This work was supported by the Spanish Economy and Competiveness ministry (AGL-2012-37815-CO5-05, AGL2011-30386-C02-02 and Ramon y Cajal research grant) and by the Portuguese FCT (PTDC/BIA-ECS/1122214/2010).

Fully cold-acclimated seedlings of winter (with incomplete vernalization) and spring oilseed rape were subjected to deacclimation under temperatures of 2/12, 12/2, 12/12, 12/20, 20/12 and 20/20 degreesC (day/night) and a 12 h photoperiod. Plants were also deacclimated under photoperiods of 8 and 16 h at constant temperatures of 12 and 20 C. After deacclimation, plants were subjected to reacclimation. Results suggest that the level of growth activity induced during deacclimation affects both the deacclimation rate and the capacity for reacclimation. Deacclimation is fully reversible if it is not accompanied by induction of elongation growth. In such cases the rate of the decrease in freezing tolerance depends on the mean temperature of deacclimation. Deacclimation becomes partially or completely irreversible when it is connected with promotion of elongation growth. The stimuli triggering elongation growth during deacclimation may be the growth-promoting temperature (20 C) during the day and the lack of vernalization blockage of elongation growth. When elongation growth was stimulated by other factors such as long-day treatments, rehardening was also disturbed.

Determination of the pest's population life table parameters is essential for understanding population development and growth under a variety of climates and as part of a pest risk analysis. The development, mortality and reproduction were studied in two pest populations (from Peru and Ecuador) in which cohorts of each life stage were exposed to different constant temperatures ranging from 10 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Using the Insect Life Cycle Modeling software, nonlinear equations were fitted to the data and an overall phenology model established to simulate life table parameters based on temperature. The temperature-dependent development curve was statistically well described for eggs by Ratkowsky's model and for larvae and pupae by Taylor's model. Variability in development time among individuals independent of temperature was significantly described by a log-logistic model. Temperature effects on immature mortality were described using different nonlinear models. Optimal temperature for survival was between 14 degrees and 17 degrees C. Temperature effects on adult senescence and oviposition time were described by simple exponential models; within-group variability was described by a Weibull distribution function. Fecundity per female due to temperature followed a nonlinear model indicating maximum reproduction at similar to 17 degrees C. The established model revealed good convergence with historical life tables established at fluctuating temperatures. The results confirm that S.tangolias is more adapted to cooler temperature than the common potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller). S.tangolias develops at temperatures within the range of 8-28.8 degrees C with a maximum finite rate of population increase (=1.053) at 21 degrees C. The established process-based physiological model can be used globally to simulate life table parameters for S.tangolias based on temperature and should prove helpful for evaluating the potential establishment risk and in adjusting pest management programmes.","[Sporleder, M.; Kroschel, J.] CIP, Lima, Peru; [Schaub, B.] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Plant Prod & Agroecol Trop & Subtrop 380, Fac Agr Sci, Stuttgart, Germany; [Aldana, G.] Agroklinge SA, Ate, Lima, Peru","CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP); University Hohenheim","Sporleder, M (corresponding author), CIP, Lange Str 59, D-37139 Adelebsen, Germany.","marcsporleder96@gmail.com","Sporleder, Marc/AAD-7961-2020","","Federal Ministry of Co-operation and Development (BMZ), Germany; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)","Federal Ministry of Co-operation and Development (BMZ), Germany; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD))","This work was funded by the Federal Ministry of Co-operation and Development (BMZ), Germany.

Several physiological indicators (respiration, excretion rates and O:N) were measured in both conditions, and alterations in the proteome during thermal fluctuations were assessed. No summer mortality was observed in abalone cultivated in fluctuating temperatures compared with that at stable high temperatures. Metabolic rates increased sharply during stable warm summer conditions and fluctuated in accordance with short-term temperature fluctuations (20-26 degrees C). Ammonia excretion rates during acute responses were comparable in both conditions. When abalone were exposed to fluctuating temperatures, enzyme activities were downregulated and structure-related protein expression was upregulated compared with that at an acclimation temperature (26 degrees C), highlighting that exposure to low temperatures during fluctuations alters molecular processes.

In this study, the demographic parameters of R. padi were determined at seven constant temperatures (8.5, 15, 20, 25, 27.5, 29 and 31 +/- 0.5 degrees C), 65 +/- 5% RH, and 14:10 (L: D) photoperiods on Zea mays L., KSC704 cultivar. The total lifespan, from birth to death, decreased with increasing the temperature from 8.5 to 29 degrees C, but the nymphal stage duration increased a little at 29 degrees C. The highest value of life expectancy (e(x)) was observed at 8.5 degrees C and at 31 degrees C, the nymphs died before reaching the adult phase. The percentage of survival for nymphal stages was highest at 15 and 25 degrees C, and the net reproductive rate (R-0=23.671 female/generation) had the highest value at 15 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) and the finite rates of increase (lambda) increased at the temperature interval of 8.5 to 25 degrees C. At this range, the doubling time (DT) and the mean generation time (T) decreased as the temperature increased. According to the highest value of r(m) (0.22 day(-1)) and lambda (1.134 day(-1)) and also the lower value of T (9.095 d) and DT (2.16 d), the temperature of 25 degrees C was determined as the optimal temperature and the data showed that the proper temperature range for growth and reproduction of this aphid was between 15-25 degrees C. The effect of temperature on reproduction, especially the intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), of R. padi would be useful for predicting its long-term population fluctuation over several generations and establishing integrated pest management (IPM) strategies against this pest.","[Abotalebian, A.] Mohaghegh Ardabili Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Protect, Ardebil, Iran; [Haghani, M.] Univ Yasuj, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Protect, Yasuj, Iran; [Norbakhsh, H.] Agr & Nat Resources Res Ctr, Shahrekord, Iran; [Abbasipour, H.; Toorani, A.

Most stocks of small pelagic species are characterized by natural, fishery-independent fluctuations, which make it difficult to predict stock development. Baltic sprat recruitment is highly variable, which can partly be related to climate-driven variability in hydrographic conditions. Results from experimental studies and field observations demonstrate that a number of important life history traits of sprat are affected by temperature, especially the survival and growth of early life stages. Projected climate-driven warming may impact important processes affecting various life stages of sprat, from survival and development during the egg and larval phases to the reproductive output of adults. This study presents a stage-based matrix model approach to simulate sprat population dynamics in relation to different climate change scenarios. Data obtained from experimental studies and field observations were used to estimate and incorporate stage-specific growth and survival rates into the model. Model-based estimates of population growth rate were affected most by changes in the transition probability of the feeding larval stage at all temperatures (+0, +2, +4, +6 A degrees C). The maximum increase in population growth rate was expected when ambient temperature was elevated by 4 A degrees C. Coupling our stage-based model and more complex, biophysical individual-based models may reveal the processes driving these expected climate-driven changes in Baltic Sea sprat population dynamics.","[Haslob, Holger; Hauss, Helena; Petereit, Christoph; Clemmesen, Catriona] Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res GEOMAR, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Kraus, Gerd] Inst Sea Fisheries, Johann Heinrich von Thunen Inst, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany; [Peck, Myron A.] Univ Hamburg, Inst Hydrobiol & Fisheries Sci IHF, D-22767 Hamburg, Germany","Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; Johann Heinrich von Thunen Institute; University of Hamburg","Haslob, H (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res GEOMAR, Dusternbrooker Weg 20, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.","hhaslob@geomar.de","Hauss, Helena/S-1718-2018; Clemmesen, Catriona/B-1480-2014; Peck, Myron A/H-6164-2011","Hauss, Helena/0000-0002-0754-3388; Clemmesen, Catriona/0000-0003-4102-7341; Peck, Myron A/0000-0001-7423-1854","German Science Foundation (DFG) [CL126/3-1, 1162]","German Science Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We are grateful to D.

The results indicated that greenhouse-grown plants (GGP) had significantly higher plant height, leaf length, and leaf width, but lower leaf thickness and total shoot mass per cluster compared with field-grown plants (FGP). Tiller emergence was almost completely suppressed in GGP. Significantly higher chlorophyll (Chl) content and lower Chl a/b ratio were observed in GGP than in FGP. From 4 to 8 weeks after treatment (WAT), net photosynthetic rate (P (N)) was significantly lower in FGP than in GGP. However, from 9 to 12 WAT, P (N) was lower in GGP, accompanied by a decrease in stomatal conductance (g (s)) and electron transport rate (ETR) compared with FGP. Suppressed P (N) in GGP under high temperature combined with low light was also indicated by photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) response curve and its diurnal fluctuation 10 WAT. Meanwhile, ETR in GGP was also lower than in FGP according to the ETR - photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) curve. The results also revealed that GGP had a lower light saturation point (LSP) and a higher light compensation point (LCP). From 4 to 8 WAT, effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (I broken vertical bar(PSII)), photochemical quenching (q(P)), and ETR were slightly lower in FGP than in GGP. The activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (POD), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were significantly higher from 4 to 8 WAT, but lower from 10 to 12 WAT in FGP. However, catalase (CAT) activity was significantly lower in FGP from 4 to 8 WAT.

Although the duration of snow cover is generally expected to decrease in the future as a result of global warming, the amounts of snow might increase in arctic areas where much of the elevated precipitation will fall as snow. We examined the effects of an increased snow cover, as a result of a snow fence treatment, on soil nitrogen mineralization, plant phenology, plant chemistry (nitrogen and potential defense compounds), the level of invertebrate herbivory, and performance of invertebrate herbivores in an arctic ecosystem, using dwarf birch (Betula nana) and the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) as study organisms. An enhanced and prolonged snow cover increased the level of herbivory on dwarf birch leaves. Larvae feeding on plants that had experienced enhanced snow cover grew faster and pupated earlier than larvae fed with plant material from control plots, indicating that plants from enhanced snow-lie plots produce higher-quality food to herbivores. The increased larval growth rate was strongly correlated with higher leaf nitrogen concentration in plants subjected to snow manipulation, and also to certain phenolic acids. Snow manipulation did not change net nitrogen mineralization rates in the soil or total carbon concentration in leaves, but it altered the within-season fluctuating pattern of leaf phenolic compounds. This study demonstrates a positive relationship between increased snow cover and level of herbivory on deciduous shrubs, thus proposing a negative feedback on the climate-induced dwarf shrub expansion in arctic areas.","[Torp, Mikaela; Olofsson, Johan] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Witzell, Johanna] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, So Swedish Forest Res Ctr, S-23053 Alnarp, Sweden; [Baxter, Robert] Univ Durham, Sch Biol & Biomed Sci, Inst Ecosyst Sci, Durham DH1 3LE, England","Umea University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Durham University","Torp, M (corresponding author), Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.","mikaela.torp@emg.umu.se","Baxter, Robert/C-7688-2012; Witzell, Johanna/H-9987-2019","Baxter, Robert/0000-0002-7504-6797; Witzell, Johanna/0000-0003-1741-443X","Centre for Environmental Research in Umea; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial [NER/A/S/2001/00460]; Natural Environment Research Council, United Kingdom; Natural Environment Research Council [earth010002] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [earth010002] Funding Source: UKRI","Centre for Environmental Research in Umea; Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial(Swedish Research Council Formas); Natural Environment Research Council, United Kingdom(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","We thank Hans Cornelissen and two anonymous reviewers for useful comments on the manuscript, Kristoffer Sivertsson for his devoted work in the field, and Clara Laguna Defoir and Rakel Berglund for their help with the chemical analyses.

At night, individuals migrate upward, back to warm layers at the surface, which are rich in food. Animals migrating in thermally-stratified lakes and, thus, crossing the thermal gradient twice a day are exposed to various negative factors, including diel changes in experienced temperature. Thermal stress would also be experienced by animals inhabiting very small water bodies that are subject to rapid heating by the sun during the day and cooling at night, or those inhabiting thermally-polluted lakes. In laboratory experiments, we demonstrate a significant reduction in the growth rate in Daphnia magna originating from various clones exposed to diel temperature fluctuations, such as those experienced during vertical migration. In addition, the levels of heat shock proteins (HSP70) are significantly reduced following a rapid change in temperature. We also find that a slow temperature change, such as that potentially experienced by animals that are either slowly migrating or avoiding intensely heated locations, is less costly for Daphnia than a fast temperature change.","[Mikulski, Andrzej; Grzesiuk, Malgorzata; Rakowska, Agnieszka; Bernatowicz, Piotr; Pijanowska, Joanna] Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Biol & Chem Res Ctr, Dept Hydrobiol, Zwirki & Wigury 101, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland; [Bernatowicz, Piotr] Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Dept Invertebrate Physiol, Miecznikowa 1, PL-02096 Warsaw, Poland","University of Warsaw; University of Warsaw","Mikulski, A (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Fac Biol, Biol & Chem Res Ctr, Dept Hydrobiol, Zwirki & Wigury 101, PL-02089 Warsaw, Poland.","a.mikulski@uw.edu.pl","Grzesiuk-Bieniek, Małgorzata/ACF-1924-2022","Bernatowicz, Piotr/0000-0002-4404-4924; Mikulski, Andrzej/0000-0002-8631-1875; Pijanowska, Joanna/0000-0001-5166-5748; Grzesiuk, Malgorzata/0000-0002-9331-7183","NCN [NN 304 138940, 2014/13/B/NZ8/04670]","NCN","We are very grateful to Dr. Cleve Hicks and Dr. Barbara Pietrzak for improving the earlier version of the manuscript and their valuable comments, to Richard J.

Several non-linear equations were fitted to the obtained data to model temperature-dependent population growth and species life history. The established equations for each life age/stage of the species were compiled to obtain an overall temperature-dependent phenology model. The life table parameters of P. solenopsis were estimated using stochastic simulation centred on a rate summation and cohort up-dating approach. The theoretical lower development threshold temperatures estimated using linear regressions applied to mean development rates were 11.2, 8.9, 9.8 and 12.7 degrees C, and the thermal constants for development were 93.7, 129.8, 97.1 and 100.0 degree days (DD) for nymph I, nymph 2, nymph 3 and male pupa stages, respectively. The developed phenology model predicted temperatures between 25 and 35 degrees C as the favourable range for P. solenopsis development, survival and reproduction. P. solenopsis population attained a maximum net reproductive rate (107-108 females/female/generation) and total fecundity (216.6-226.5 individuals/ female/generation) at temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees C. Mean length of generations decreased from 75.6 days at 15 degrees C to 21 days at 40 degrees C. The maximum finite rate of increase (1.12-1.16 females/female/ day) and shortest doubling time (4.3-6.1 days) were also observed at temperatures between 25 and 35 degrees C. The simulation of phenology model at fluctuating temperatures indicated that P. solenopsis populations might potentially increase with a finite rate of 1.06 females/female/day with an average generation time of 58.7 days and a doubling time of 12.1 days. The obtained life table parameters were reasonably similar when compared with literature data. The present model can be simulated spatially for estimating the pest risk and undertaking agro-ecoregion specific pest management strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This variation influences ecological interactions and epidemiological dynamics, yet most experimental studies examine interactions under constant conditions. We examined the effects of variability in temperature on the host-pathogen relationship between an aquatic zooplankton host (Daphnia laevis) and an environmentally transmitted fungal pathogen (Metschnikowia bicuspidata). We manipulated temperature variability by exposing all populations to mean temperatures of 20 degrees C for the length of the experiments, but introducing periods of 1, 2, and 4hr each day where the populations were exposed to 28 degrees C followed by periods of the same length (1, 2, and 4hr, respectively) where the populations were exposed to 12 degrees C. Three experiments were performed to assess the role of thermal variability on Daphnia-pathogen interactions, specifically with respect to: (1) host infection prevalence and intensity; (2) free-living pathogen survival; and (3) host foraging ecology. We found that temperature variability affected host filtering rate, which is closely related to pathogen transmission in this system. Further, infection prevalence was reduced as a function of temperature variability, while infection intensity was not influenced, suggesting that pathogen transmission was influenced by temperature variability, but the growth of pathogen within infected hosts was not. Host survival was reduced by temperature variability, but environmental pathogen survival was unaffected, suggesting that zooplankton hosts were more sensitive than the fungal pathogen to variable temperatures. Together, these experiments suggest that temperature variability may influence host demography and host-pathogen interactions, providing a link between host foraging ecology and pathogen transmission.","[Dallas, Tad; Drake, John M.] Univ Georgia, Odum Sch Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Dallas, Tad] Univ Calif Davis, Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Drake, John M.] Univ Georgia, Ctr Ecol Infect Dis, Athens, GA 30602 USA","University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of California System; University of California Davis; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia","Dallas, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Environm Sci & Policy, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","tdallas@uga.edu","Dallas, Tad/H-5577-2019; Dallas, Tad/GRN-7970-2022","Dallas, Tad/0000-0003-3328-9958; Dallas, Tad/0000-0003-3328-9958","University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology","University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology","University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology.",NA,"64","6","6","2","26","WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

The weight of each seed and its surrounding endocarp was determined. Based on weight, the seeds were divided into four quartiles, stratified, and grown at 23 degreesC with a 16 h photoperiod. The percentage of seeds germinating over an 8-week period was then recorded. Seed weight significantly affected germination characteristics of the rootstock seeds. The final percentage, time and duration of germination correlated with quartile. In addition, relative growth rate during the first 3 weeks of growth and final plant height also correlated with quartile. Therefore, the heaviest seeds produced the most vigorous seedlings. In a second trial, seeds were grown at constant temperatures (10, 15, 20 or 25 degreesC) or under ambient conditions. For seeds germinated at 15-25 degreesC and ambient temperatures, there was no difference in either their speed or duration of germination. However, those placed at 10 degreesC were both slower to germinate and had a greater duration of germination. At constant temperatures, there was a trend for percentage germination to increase with temperature. However, the highest germination was found in seeds germinated at ambient temperatures that varied diurnally. For each individual cultivar, there was a strong correlation between seed size and the size of the endocarp or stone. Therefore, the grading of either stones or seeds on the basis of size or weight and the removal of the smallest individuals will help improve germination, seedling quality and uniformity.

To elucidate the mechanism of the bloom, the effect of temperature on light-limited growth of C. wailesii was examined at 13 irradiance levels (5-350 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) in combination with 4 temperature levels (9.0-20.0 degrees C). The results showed that all the parameters of growth-irradiance curves such as the maximum growth rate, half saturation constant, threshold value of irradiance and saturation irradiance for growth increased with increasing temperature. On the basis of the relationship between temperature and growth-irradiance curves and seasonal fluctuation of the light environment in Harima-Nada, the population dynamics of C. wailesii during the period from October to March was evaluated using two indices D-t (depth of the threshold irradiance for growth) and D-0.5 (depth of growth rate is 0.5 divisions per day). As the vegetative cells of C. wailesii tend to distribute in relatively deeper water layers where the growth is limited by irradiance, the increase in the depth range over which C. wailesii is able to grow or grow at a high growth rate is concluded to be an important factor allowing the development of the blooms.

To test the effects of changes in growth temperature on foliar carbon balance and plant growth, we repeatedly exposed poplar saplings (Populus deltoides x nigra) to temperature cycles consisting of 5 days of a moderate (M, +5 degrees C) or extreme (E, + 10 degrees C) increase in temperature followed by 5 days of a moderate (M, -5 degrees C) or extreme (E, -10 degrees C) decrease in temperature, with respect to a control treatment (C, 23.4 degrees C). The temperature treatments had the same mean temperature over each warm and cool cycle and over the entire study. Our goal was to examine the influence of recurring temperature shifts on growth. Net photosynthesis (A) was relatively insensitive to changes in growth temperature (from 20 to 35 degrees C), suggesting a broad range of optimum temperature for photosynthesis. Leaf respiration (R) exhibited substantial acclimation to temperature, having nearly the same rate at 13 degrees C as at 33 degrees C. There was no evidence that preconditioning through temperature cycles affected the response of A or R to treatment temperature fluctuations. Averaged across the complete warm/cool temperature cycle, the A : R ratio did not differ among the temperature treatments. While foliar carbon balance was not affected, the temperature treatments significantly affected growth. Whole-plant biomass was 1.5 times greater in the M treatment relative to the C treatment. Carbon allocation was also affected with shoot volume and biomass greater in the M and E treatments than in the C treatment. Our findings indicate that temperature fluctuations can have important effects on growth, though there were few effects on leaf gas exchange, and can help explain differences in growth that are not correlated with mean growth temperature.","[Cerasoli, Sofia; Rodrigues, Ana; Pereira, Joao Santos] Univ Tecn Lisboa, Forest Res Ctr, Sch Agr, Lisbon, Portugal; [Wertin, Timothy; McGuire, Mary Anne; Aubrey, Doug P.; Teskey, Robert O.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Wertin, Timothy] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Aubrey, Doug P.] Georgia So Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA","Universidade de Lisboa; Forest Research Centre; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University","Wertin, T (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","twertin@illinois.edu","Rodrigues, Ana/AAR-7086-2020; Cerasoli, Sofia/D-8605-2013; McGuire, Mary Anne/A-8089-2008","Rodrigues, Ana/0000-0002-9704-6579; Cerasoli, Sofia/0000-0002-9118-193X; McGuire, Mary Anne/0000-0002-9629-524X; Aubrey, Doug/0000-0002-2919-6399","United States Department of Energy NICCR Program [07-SC-NICCR-1060]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/28384/2006]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/28384/2006] Funding Source: FCT","United States Department of Energy NICCR Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","This work was supported by a grant from the United States Department of Energy NICCR Program (Grant: 07-SC-NICCR-1060).

Photosynthetic activity of small stands of Lolium perenne was continuously studied for up to two weeks under low photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the air temperature range from -3 degrees C to +9 degrees C. The photosynthetic rate of plants growing at 2, 6 and 9 degrees C was similar at 120 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD but the rate increased with increasing PPFD at all temperatures, particularly 9 degrees C. Light saturation of photosynthesis was reached at approx. 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 2 and 6 degrees C, and at approx. 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 9 degrees C. At 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), the CO2 exchange rate (CER) at 2 degrees C was approx. 60% of that at 9 degrees C. When the temperature increased gradually from 0 degrees C at start to +5 degrees C at the end of the 8-h photoperiod, CER decreased by about 20% compared with that at constant 5 degrees C. Changing the temperature from constant +5 degrees C to a diurnal variation between -2 and +2 degrees C gradually decreased daytime CER to approx. 10% after five days, partly due to leaf area losses (similar to 50% loss) when the poorly acclimatised plants were exposed to frost. At start of the photoperiod at -2 degrees C CER was negative, but became slightly positive when temperature exceeded -1 degrees C after two hours. Total daily photosynthesis was negative due to night-time respiration in this treatment. Soil heating to avoid freezing when the diurnal air temperature fluctuated between -3 and +3 degrees C had no effect on CER at this low PPFD level (150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). In contrast to the -2/+2 degrees C treatment, total daily photosynthesis was slightly positive in the -3/+3 degrees C treatment, where the plants were better acclimatised to frost. Increasing the CO2 concentration from 350 to 600 mu mol mol(-1) had no effect on CER at 2 and 6 degrees C, but increased it by 20% at 9 degrees C. The data indicate that the minimum temperature for photosynthesis in the cultivar studied is about -4 degrees C. The results can be applied in different photosynthesis models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Phenology, yield and yield components from February to September 2020 monthly plantings were gathered. Solar radiation, rainfall, relative humidity and air temperature were gathered from the nearest weather station, wherein cumulative solar radiation (CSR) and cumulative rainfall (CRF) were derived based on the duration of monthly-planted crops. Significant variation in cumulative rainfall, cumulative solar radiation, relative humidity and temperature (3751313 mm, 1809-2419 MJ m(-2), 76.7-87.1%, 23.7-33.60 degrees C, respectively) were observed across eight planting time. Highest and lowest temperature fluctuations were recorded in February (12.590C) and September planted crops (7.120 degrees C), respectively. February, March and April planted crops were exposed to lower relative humidity (below 80%), while higher RH (above 80%) in May, June, July, August and September planted crops. USM 10 had shortest growth duration (103 d). CW 1630 had the highest crop growth rate CGR (27.7 g m(-2)d(-1)) from silking to dough stages attributed to high number of leaves (NL) leaf area index (LAI) and plant height (PH). USM VAR10 had low CGR (21.3 g m(-2) d(-1)) due to low NL, LAI and PH. Crops planted in May had highest harvest index (HI) (0.38) and total dry matter (TDM) (14,066.2 kg ha(-1)). March planted crops had high NL, while August planted crops were tallest and had high LAI, (3.87). Maximum temperature, CSR, minimum temperature and CRF had significant contribution to the grain yield development of maize varieties. Higher maximum and minimum temperatures decreased grain yield of maize varieties. Maximum temperature appeared to be the main yield-limiting climatic factor in four maize varieties. Grain yield of J505 decreased with increasing maximum and minimum temperatures and RH, while it increased with increasing CSR and CRF. Minimum temperature and RH were the main yieldlimiting climatic factors in J505 variety. CW1630 grain yield increased with increasing CSR but decreased with increasing CRF. Cumulative rainfall was the main yield-limiting climatic factor in CW1630. Grain yield of USM VAR10 increased with increasing CSR while reduced by other climatic parameters. Relative humidity appeared to be the major yield-limiting climatic factor in USM VAR10. Higher grain yield was obtained in IPB VAR 11 with increasing CSR and CRF, while high maximum and minimum temperatures decreased grain yield. Maximum temperature was the major yield-limiting climatic factor for IPB VAR 11. CW 1630 can be recommended for Los Banos conditions having the Type III climate and particularly, it should be planted in May. But the variety could be suitable for February and March plantings.","[Kumara, Lakshman P. G.

Most analyses of the potential biological impacts have focused on changes in mean temperature, but changes in thermal variance will also impact organisms and populations. We assessed the combined effects of the mean and variance of temperature on thermal tolerances, organismal survival, and population growth in Drosophila melanogaster. Because the performance of ectotherms relates nonlinearly to temperature, we predicted that responses to thermal variation (+/-0 degrees or +/-5 degrees C) would depend on the mean temperature (17 degrees or 24 degrees C). Consistent with our prediction, thermal variation enhanced the rate of population growth (r(max)) at a low mean temperature but depressed this rate at a high mean temperature. The interactive effect on fitness occurred despite the fact that flies improved their heat and cold tolerances through acclimation to thermal conditions. Flies exposed to a high mean and a high variance of temperature recovered from heat coma faster and survived heat exposure better than did flies that developed at other conditions. Relatively high survival following heat exposure was associated with low survival following cold exposure. Recovery from chill coma was affected primarily by the mean temperature; flies acclimated to a low mean temperature recovered much faster than did flies acclimated to a high mean temperature. To develop more realistic predictions about the biological impacts of climate change, one must consider the interactions between the mean environmental temperature and the variance of environmental temperature.","[Bozinovic, Francisco; Bastias, Daniel A.; Boher, Francisca; Clavijo-Baquet, Sabrina; Estay, Sergio A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile; [Bozinovic, Francisco; Boher, Francisca] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Lab Int Cambio Global, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile; [Estay, Sergio A.] Univ Austral Chile, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ecol & Evoluc, Valdivia 6513677, Chile; [Angilletta, Michael J., Jr.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Life Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad Austral de Chile; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe","Bozinovic, F (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Dept Ecol, Santiago 6513677, Chile.","fbozinovic@bio.puc.cl","Bastías, Daniel A./GWR-1815-2022; Bastias, Daniel A./AFN-3093-2022","Bastías, Daniel A./0000-0002-0522-5538; Bastias, Daniel A./0000-0002-0522-5538; Estay, Sergio/0000-0002-3797-8964; Clavijo-Baquet, Sabrina/0000-0002-9784-9144","Fondo Nacional de Areas Prioritarias [1501-0001]; Laboratorio Internacional en Cambio Global","Fondo Nacional de Areas Prioritarias; Laboratorio Internacional en Cambio Global","This study was funded by grants from Fondo Nacional de Areas Prioritarias (1501-0001) and Laboratorio Internacional en Cambio Global to F.

Potato is a secondary host of the species but the major threat from this insect in the Andean region for potato is the transmission by this insect of a crinivirus causing Potato yellow vein disease. Determination of the pest's temperature-dependent population growth potential is crucial knowledge for understanding the population dynamics and spread potential of the species and the diseases it can transmit, as well as for designing effective pest management strategies. Trialeurodes vaporariorum development, mortality and reproduction were studied at seven constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 32 degrees C. The Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software was used to fit nonlinear equations to the data and establish an overall phenology model to simulate life-table parameters based on temperature. In addition, life tables of T. vaporarionum were established at daily fluctuating temperature in two different environments: Cusco (5 degrees C-35 degrees C) and La Molina, Lima (13.7 degrees C-24.9 degrees C), and used to adjust and validate the model. The insect only completed its life cycle at constant temperatures above 15 degrees C and below 32 degrees C although the cycle was completed at daily fluctuating temperatures between 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The overall model portrayed population development within the temperature range of 14 degrees to 32 degrees C with a maximum finite rate of population increase (= 1.14) at 23 degrees C. However, the model revealed poor convergence with life tables established at fluctuating temperatures indicating an influential effect of temperature fluctuations on the whitefly life history parameters, particularly on adult survival time and reproduction. Therefore, we adjusted the model for convergence with a single life table observed at fluctuating temperature. The adjusted model gave good predictions when compared with remaining observed life tables and published data. The adjusted model predicted population development within the temperature range of 11.5 degrees C-35.5 degrees C, and maximum population growth at around 24 degrees C with a finite rate of increase, lambda, of 1.137 and a population doubling time of 5 days. The established process-based physiological model presented here for T. vaporariorum can be used for predicting the species distribution potential based on temperature worldwide and should prove helpful in adjusting pest management measures. Moreover, the information obtained will be used to predict the spread potential of potato yellow vein disease.","[Gamarra, Heidy; Sporleder, Marc; Carhuapoma, Pablo; Kroschel, Jurgen; Kreuze, Jan] Int Potato Ctr CIP, Crop Syst Intensificat & Climate Change, Av La Molina 1895, Lima 12, Peru; [Gamarra, Heidy; Sporleder, Marc; Carhuapoma, Pablo; Kroschel, Jurgen; Kreuze, Jan] Int Potato Ctr CIP, Apartado 1558, Lima 12, Peru","CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP); CGIAR; International Potato Center (CIP)","Sporleder, M (corresponding author), Int Potato Ctr CIP, Crop Syst Intensificat & Climate Change, Av La Molina 1895, Lima 12, Peru.","marc.sporleder@aol.de","","","CGIAR Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas (RTB); CGIAR Fund Donors; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP53344]","CGIAR Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas (RTB)(CGIAR); CGIAR Fund Donors(CGIAR); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)","We are thankful to Maria Rivera and Eva Huaman for support during data collection and to Katya Chipana from INIA for providing space and supporting the life table experiments in Cusco.

In the greenhouse cultivation, air temperature and relative air humidity are regulated by switching on/off the evaporative systems and opening/closing the roof windows, which causes VPD fluctuation. However, it remains unclear how VPD fluctuation affects photosynthetic and growth performance in plants. Here, we examined the effects of the VPD fluctuation on the photosynthetic and growth characteristics in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.). The parameters for gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence and biomass production were evaluated under the conditions of drastic (1.63 kPa for 6 min and 0.63 for 3 min) or moderate (1.32 kPa for 7 min and 0.86 kPa for 3 min) VPD fluctuation. The drastic VPD fluctuation induced gradual decrease in stomatal conductance and thus CO2 assimilation rate during the measurements, while moderate VPD fluctuation caused no reduction of these parameters. Furthermore, data showed moderate VPD fluctuation maintained leaf expansion and the efficiency of CO2 diffusion across leaf surface, resulting in enhanced plant growth compared with drastic VPD fluctuation. Taken together, fine regulation of VPD can be crucial for better plant growth by maintaining the photosynthetic performance in lettuce.

The knowledge of its biological traits is fundamental to establish sustainable pest management strategies. One of the main factors determining population dynamics of arthropods is temperature. Therefore, modelling the response of the development of pests to this factor contributes to anticipate risk situations and to establish possible new areas of colonization. A mortality model and thirty-two developmental models were used to describe the relationship between the immature survival and developmental rate of D. suzukii versus temperature. The survival and developmental times of the immature stages were determined across a broad range of temperatures (10-31 degrees C). Then, the models were fitted and the predictions of the developmental models compared with the developmental times obtained under three regimes of fluctuating temperatures (4-16, 13-25 and 21-32 degrees C). Developmental models were applied to the complete range of temperatures studied at each regime, or they were truncated for the lower and upper regimes at the temperatures that produced 100% immature mortality estimated with the mortality model (8.7-30.9 degrees C). Better predictions were obtained with the non-truncated models, indicating that some development occurred under short exposures to temperatures beyond those producing 100% mortality during immature development. The Regniere, Lactin II, Hansen, Lobry-Rosso-Flandrois and Logan III models produced the lowest deviations and provided the most realistic lower and higher development thresholds.","[Sanchez-Ramos, Ismael; Fernandez, Cristina E.; Gonzalez-Nunez, Manuel] Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria OA MP, Entomol Grp, Dept Plant Protect, Carretera La Coruna Km 7,5, Madrid 28040, Spain","Instituto Nacional Investigacion Tecnologia Agraria Alimentaria (INIA)","Sanchez-Ramos, I (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Invest & Tecnol Agr & Alimentaria OA MP, Entomol Grp, Dept Plant Protect, Carretera La Coruna Km 7,5, Madrid 28040, Spain.","ismael@inia.es","Núñez, Manuel González/M-3027-2018","Núñez, Manuel González/0000-0002-7572-8106; Sanchez-Ramos, Ismael/0000-0003-0070-2953","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [266505]","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain(Spanish Government)","This work was supported by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain by the Project 266505 FP7-ERANET EUPHRESCO II.

As an emerging pollutant, microplastics are widely distributed in the freshwater environment, raising concerns regard-ing their potential toxicity to organisms. Especially for zooplankton filter feeders, many of microplastics are in similar size as their food. Individually, both microplastics and temperature have profound effects on zooplankton populations and their function in ecosystems. However, the strength and direction of their interactive effects are still not clear. Here, we performed a comprehensive biotoxicity assessment providing empirical evidence that the temperature played a key role in shaping the sensitivity of the zooplankter, Daphnia magna, against microplastic toxicity. We found that exposure to microplastics generally caused negative effects on Daphnia individual fitness, such as increased lethality, declined fecundity and reduced population growth rate. This microplastic toxicity was more prominent at 30 degrees C than at 20 degrees C, and was rather minor at 15 degrees C. Moreover, the warming accelerated the ingestion of microplastics, and triggered abnormal ultrastructure of intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, the ex -pression profiling of candidate genes revealed oxidative damage, fecundity impairment and energy retardation by microplastics were amplified with increasing temperature, which may contribute to the enhancement of microplastic toxicity under warming. Given that high temperature fluctuations are becoming more common and difficult to predict, the interactive effects of microplastics and climate warming on Daphnia population dy-namics and biomass production may become increasingly aggravated in nature. Collectively, extrapolation for environmental risk assessment studies conducted under different temperature contexts may broaden our knowl-edge microplastic toxicity on aquatic organism fitness.

Interaction between iron (Fe) stress and RZT were then studied by exposing the plant roots to 2 different RZTs: a constant cool 25 degrees C-RZT (CRZT) and a fluctuating hot ambient RZT(ARZT). There were three different Fe levels [full Fe (FFe), 1/2Fe, and 0Fe] in the nutrient medium supplied to plants at each RZT. Compared to plant grown at CRZT, hot ARZT resulted in decreases in shoot and root productivities, photosynthetic CO2 assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance (g(s)), Fe and nitrate (NO3-) uptake and transport and nitrate reductase activity (NRA). Hot ARZT also altered root morphology. Iron stress (1/2Fe and 0Fe) caused significant reductions in all the above parameters and changed root morphology when plants were grown at CRZT compared to those grown at FFe. However, most of the parameters studied had similar values at ARZT regardless of Fe levels. These results indicate that hot ARZT may mask the effects of Fe stress on certain physiological process which was clearly elucidated at RZT.","[He, Jie; Chua, N. Y.

Monoclonal and polyclonal (4 and 8 genotypes) subplots were outplanted into the mid intertidal in Metri Bay (Puerto Montt, Chile) during summer, a season in which A. chilense face higher temperatures (>18 degrees C) and low nitrogen availability (<4.00 mu mol). Ancud farm genotypes show higher growth rates in the monoclonal rather than the two polyclonal subplots. A similar tendency, yet not significant, was discernible in Chaica. In addition, whatever the population of origin of the thalli, no effect of genotypic diversity was detected neither on the agar yield and its quality, nor on the epiphyte load. Such unexpected results of a higher performance in plots with a lower genotypic diversity could be explained (a) by human-assisted selection for dominant-best-performing genotypes that could counterbalance the negative effect caused by the low genotypic diversity in farms and (b) by the fact that the organisms inhabiting the algal mats do not impact the fitness of their host. Overall, the results obtained here suggest that despite farm induced selection lead to impoverished pools of genotypes, they may also have a positive effect of on the resistance of farmed populations to seasonal stressors. However, whether this may have a secondary negative effect on the longer term in a fluctuating environment remains to be determined, but may be avoided by adopting strategy of selection favoring different genotypes in space and time, as implemented in forestry.","[Usandizaga, Sara] Univ Los Lagos, Ctr Imar & CeBiB, Programa Doctorado Ciencias Menc Conservac & Mane, Puerto Montt, Chile; [Buschmann, Alejandro H.; Camus, Carolina; Kappes, Jose Luis] Univ Los Lagos, Ctr Imar & CeBiB, Puerto Montt, Chile; [Arnaud-Haond, Sophie] IFREMER, Lab Environm Profond, Ctr Brest, Plouzane, France; [Mauger, Stephane] Univ Austral Chile, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, UMI Evolutionary Biol & Ecol Algae 3614, Roscoff, France; [Valero, Myriam; Guillemin, Marie Laure] Univ Austral Chile, Sorbonne Univ, Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, CNRS,UMI Evolutionary Biol & Ecol Algae 3614, Roscoff, France; [Guillemin, Marie Laure] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Evolut, Fac Ciencias, Ctr FONDAP Invest Dinam Ecosistemas Marinos Altas, Valdivia, Chile","Universidad de Los Lagos; Universidad de Los Lagos; Ifremer; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universidad Austral de Chile; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universidad Austral de Chile; Universidad Austral de Chile","Guillemin, ML (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Stn Biol Roscoff, CNRS,UMI Evolutionary Biol & Ecol Algae 3614,Sorb, CS 90074,Pl Georges Teissier, F-29688 Roscoff, France.","marielaure.guillemin@gmail.com","Valero, Myriam/M-6052-2019; Arnaud-Haond, Sophie/B-2479-2008; Buschmann, Alejandro H./B-4770-2012","Valero, Myriam/0000-0002-9000-1423; Arnaud-Haond, Sophie/0000-0001-5814-8452; Buschmann, Alejandro H./0000-0003-3246-681X; Mauger, Stephane/0000-0002-8779-1516; Guillemin, Marie-Laure/0000-0001-5703-7662","international research network (GDRI) [0803]; Clonix [ANR11-BSV7-00704]; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica [FB-0001]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [1150987, 1170541]; IDEALG [ANR-10-BTBR-04]; Clonix2 [ANR-18-CE32-0001-05]","international research network (GDRI); Clonix; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); IDEALG; Clonix2","international research network (GDRI), Grant/Award Number: 0803; Clonix, Grant/Award Number: ANR11-BSV7-00704; Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica, Grant/Award Number: FB-0001; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: No 1150987 and No 1170541; Clonix2, Grant/Award Number: ANR-18-CE32-0001-05; IDEALG, Grant/Award Number: ANR-10-BTBR-04",NA,"65","3","3","0","3","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1752-4571","","","EVOL APPL","Evol.

Moringa oleifera seeds were planted into seedling trays and placed into three temperature-controlled greenhouses with fluctuating night/day temperature regimes namely: 10/20 degrees C. 15/25 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C. Seedling trays were monitored daily over a period of 40 days, to record differences in germination percentage, rate and uniformity, and seedling growth. Seed at the high 20/30 degrees C temperature regime (TR) exhibited a significantly (P <= 0.05) higher germination, rate and uniformity of germination, compared to the two lower temperature regimes (TRs). The germination of 74% for the 20/30 degrees C TR was the lowest, and differed significantly from the 88% germination for the 10/20 degrees C TR. Viability testing of un-germinated seed revealed that although germination percentages increased with the decrease in TR, this was not as a result of uneven seed viability. The higher 20/30 degrees C TR also favoured seedling growth, as growth increased exponentially with an increase in temperature. Among the three TRs studied during this trial, the 20/30 degrees C TR was found to be most favourable for both germination and seedling growth.","[Muhl, Q. E.; du Toit, E. S.; Robbertse, P.

Coastal Plain. Temperature was varied both naturally and artificially to examine its effect on mayfly growth. Growth rates of Stenonema spp. in artificial streams were correlated with temperature (r2 = 0.71) and were as high as 0.12 mg mg-1 d-1 in the summer. Baetis spp. growth rates were also temperature-dependent (r2 = 0.84) and summer values were even higher (0.35 d-1) than those of Stenonema. Experimental treatments at natural temperatures, but reduced algal food (no light) or reduced detrital/bacterial food (20-mu-m filtered vs. 0.5-mu-m filtered river water) showed little effect on Stenonema growth rates. Algae were a small component of the biofilm that accumulates on solid substrata (snags) and Stenonema were able to feed and grow very well on only non-algal microfine particulate organic matter and microbes. The high densities of sestonic bacteria and tendency for dissolved organic carbon to flocculate on substrata in this Coastal Plain river make it unlikely that food limits Stenonema growth rates through most of the year. These results are consistent with independent feeding experiments using radio-labelled bacteria showing that bacteria can comprise a major component of Stenonema diets and serve as an important trophic link between organic matter and macroconsumers.

This simplifying assumption is made because few data are available on the magnitude and structure of the spatial variability of soil temperature within rangeland communities. The influence of sagebrush on the spatial variability and diurnal fluctuations of near-surface soil temperature was examined within a sagebrush-grass plant community. Hourly soil temperatures were measured at 1-, 5-, and 10-cm depths at 30-cm intervals along a 12.3-m north-south transect over a 6-day period in March, 1989. Both classical and geostatistical techniques were used to quantify and model the magnitude and structure of the spatial and temporal variability. Maximum soil temperatures at the 1-cm depth varied from 7 to 23-degrees-C under sagebrush and bare interspace, respectively. Periodic spatial patterns in soil temperature were found for all measured depths with a wavelength of periodicity approximately equal to the separation distance between sagebrush plants along the transect. Diurnal variability in near surface soil temperature was much greater in interspace areas compared to under sagebrush plants. The amplitude of diurnal variability in soil temperature at the 1-cm depth under sagebrush was similar to the amplitude of the diurnal variability at the 10-cm depth within the interspaces.","","","PIERSON, FB (corresponding author), USDA ARS,NW WATERSHED RES CTR,800 PK BLVD,PL IV,SUITE 105,BOISE,ID 83712, USA.","","","","","","",NA,"30","63","65","1","10","SOC RANGE MANAGEMENT","DENVER","1839 YORK ST, DENVER, CO 80206","0022-409X","","","J RANGE MANAGE","J.

The grapevine is a large perennial that has an extensive below-ground structural system; however its diurnal root growth pattern has received little attention. The aim of this study was to characterize the diurnal fine root growth dynamics of four grapevine genotypes and to assess the impact of soil temperature on this growth. One-year-old vines of Shiraz (Vitis vinifera), and the rootstocks Ramsey (V. champinii), 140 Ruggeri (V. berlandieri x V. rupestris) and Schwarzmann (V. rupestris x V. riparia) were grown in tapered rectangular pots with transparent acrylic windows to assess diurnal root growth dynamics using sequential image acquisition with a high resolution scanner. All four genotypes displayed a pronounced diurnal root growth pattern that positively followed daily soil temperature fluctuations. Maximum growth rates did not differ between the genotypes and were highest in the afternoon, declined through the night and reached a minimum the next morning. While diurnal root growth rates were influenced by soil temperature, this was not the only factor as evidenced by an extensive range of growth rates between the individual roots of a plant even when exposed to optimal temperatures. It is argued here that other environmental and endogenous factors will likely have an influence on the maximum rate of growth.","[Mahmud, Kare P.; Smith, Jason P.; Rogiers, Suzy Y.; Holzapfel, Bruno P.] Charles Sturt Univ, Natl Wine & Grape Ind Ctr, Locked Bag 588, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia; [Rogiers, Suzy Y.; Holzapfel, Bruno P.] New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia; [Guisard, Yann] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Agr & Wine Sci, POB 883, Orange, NSW 2800, Australia; [Nielsen, Sharon] Charles Sturt Univ, Res Off, 28 Peters St Mareeba, Wagga Wagga, Qld 4880, Australia; [Mahmud, Kare P.] Dept Agr & Fisheries, Mareeba, Qld 4880, Australia","Charles Sturt University; NSW Department of Primary Industries; Charles Sturt University; Charles Sturt University","Mahmud, KP (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Natl Wine & Grape Ind Ctr, Locked Bag 588, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia.;Mahmud, KP (corresponding author), Dept Agr & Fisheries, Mareeba, Qld 4880, Australia.","kare.mahmud@daf.qld.gov.au","Mahmud, Kare/AAR-6186-2020; Guisard, Yann/O-9267-2019; Rogiers, Suzy/AAO-3360-2020","Guisard, Yann/0000-0002-4932-8336; Rogiers, Suzy/0000-0001-6637-3561","National Wine and Grape Industry Centre, Charles Sturt University; New South Wales Department of Primary Industry","National Wine and Grape Industry Centre, Charles Sturt University; New South Wales Department of Primary Industry","This work was supported by the National Wine and Grape Industry Centre, Charles Sturt University and New South Wales Department of Primary Industry.

To better understand this phenomenon, we examined the combined effects of temperature (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C) and nutrient availability (seawater enriched with 25% Provasoli's enriched seawater vs nonenriched seawater) on photosynthesis, growth and survival and nitrogen and chlorophyll a contents of juvenile sporophytes (2-3 cm) and larger size class sporophytes (100-150 cm) from southern Hokkaido. Both juvenile sporophytes and discs from 100-150-cm-class sporophytes cultured in enriched seawater showed significantly higher growth rates and photosynthetic activities than those cultured in nonenriched seawater. This difference likely was due to the significantly higher nitrogen and chlorophyll a contents of thalli grown in enriched seawater. Significant effects of temperature on growth and photosynthesis were also detected. A significant interaction between temperature and nutrient availability for relative growth rate (RGR) was detected. The positive effect of elevated nutrient availability on RGRs was magnified by an increase in temperature from 5 degrees C to 15 degrees C for juvenile sporophytes and from 5 degrees C to 10 degrees C for 100-150-cm-class sporophytes; whereas, the negative effect of elevated temperature from 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C on RGRs of 100-150-cm-class sporophytes was antagonised by a reduction in nutrient availability. In contrast to the 100% survival rate in enriched seawater, dead juvenile sporophytes and discs from 100-150-cm-class sporophytes were found at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C in nonenriched seawater, and the survival rates decreased with increasing temperature. Therefore, the growth and survival of sporophytes of S. japonica are significantly affected by nutrient availability and temperature, which may lead to marked fluctuations in annual production.","[Gao, Xu; Endo, Hikaru; Nagaki, Michiko; Agatsuma, Yukio] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Lab Marine Plant Ecol, Sendai, Miyagi 9818555, Japan; [Gao, Xu] Kobe Univ, Res Ctr Inland Seas, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Nagaki, Michiko] Fisheries Fishing Port Part, Sendai Reg Dev Off, Shiogama, Miyagi 9850001, Japan","Tohoku University; Kobe University","Gao, X (corresponding author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Lab Marine Plant Ecol, Sendai, Miyagi 9818555, Japan.;Gao, X (corresponding author), Kobe Univ, Res Ctr Inland Seas, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.","algaepanda69@163.com","","Endo, Hikaru/0000-0002-1983-1854","Japanese Society for Promotion of Science [B17380111]","Japanese Society for Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","We sincerely thank Professor Emeritus K.

Here, we tested the effects of warming on the metabolic rates and life-history parameters of the widespread cladoceran Ceriodaphnia silvestrii. Two scenarios of global warming were established, an increase of 2 degrees C and an increase of 4 degrees C; the control temperature was 22 degrees C. Our results showed that warming altered C. silvestrii metabolic rates, by increasing the rates of assimilation and secondary production, and decreasing the rates of filtration and ingestion. Warming also increased C. silvestrii fecundity and the body size of neonates and juveniles, and decreased the embryonic and post-embryonic time of development. C. silvestrii might be an important food resource at intermediary temperature as it had higher assimilation rates, even filtering fewer algae. At the highest temperature, we observed a substantial decrease in assimilation and secondary production, which could be a sign of stress starting. The increase in temperature by global warming will affect the cladocerans' metabolic processes and the population survival, even a small increase (2 degrees C) might induce drastic fluctuations in such processes and affect the carbon and energy availability inside aquatic food-webs.","[Bomfim, Francieli F.; Lansac-Toha, Fabio A.] Univ Estadual Maringa UEM, Programa Posgrad Ecol Bientes Aquat Continentals, Nucleo Pesquisas Limnol Ictiol & Aquicultura Nupe, Av Colombo 5790,Campus Univ, BR-87020900 Maringa, Parana, Brazil; [Melao, Maria G.

Thus, perhaps the commonly asked question whether dinosaurs were ectotherms or endotherms is inappropriate, and it is more constructive to ask which dinosaurs were likely to have been endothermic and which ones ectothermic. Field data from crocodiles over a large size range show that body temperature fluctuations decrease with increasing body mass, and that average daily. body temperatures increase with increasing mass. A biophysical model, the biological relevance of which was tested against field data, was used to predict body temperatures of dinosaurs. However, rather than predicting thermal relations of a hypothetical dinosaur, the model considered correct paleogeographical distribution and climate to predict the thermal relations of a large number of dinosaurs known from the fossil record (>700). Many dinosaurs could have had high (greater than or equal to30degreesC) and stable (daily amplitude less than or equal to2degreesC body temperatures without metabolic heat production even in winter, so it is unlikely that selection pressure would have favored the evolution of elevated resting metabolic rates in those species. Recent evidence of ontogenetic growth rates indicates that even the juveniles of large species (3000-4000 kg) could have had biologically functional body temperature ranges during early development. Smaller dinosaurs (<100 kg) at mid to high latitudes (>45degrees) could not have had high and stable body temperatures without metabolic heat production. However, elevated metabolic rates were unlikely to have provided selective advantage in the absence of some form of insulation, so probably insulation was present before endothermy evolved, or else it coevolved with elevated metabolic rates. Superimposing these findings onto a phylogeny of the Dinosauria suggests that endothermy most likely evolved among the Coelurosauria and, to a lesser extent, among the Hypsilophodontidae, but not among the Stegosauridae, Nodosauridae, Ankylosauridae, Hadrosauridae, Ceratopsidae, Prosauropoda, and Sauropoda.","Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","University of Sydney","Seebacher, F (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, A08, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.","fseebach@bio.usyd.edu.au","","Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311","","","",NA,"140","67","72","12","182","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","0094-8373","1938-5331","","PALEOBIOLOGY","Paleobiology","WIN","2003","29","1","",NA,"",NA,"105","122","","10.1666/0094-8373(2003)029<0105:DBTTOO>2.0.CO;2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1666/0094-8373(2003)029<0105:DBTTOO>2.0.CO;2","","","18","Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Paleontology","644MN",NA,"Green Published","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000180922000016","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It includes a module for tuber infection of plants with a tuberborne (secondary) infection (efficiency of autoinfection). This module postulates a monomolecular function for the relation between the efficiency of autoinfection and developmental heat, providing a theoretical basis for understanding how an infectious, systemic virus and the environment, represented by temperature, are interacting. The module was calibrated with temperature and autoinfection data obtained with the modern potato cultivar Yungay (Solanum tuberosum ssp, tuberosum X S. tuberosum ssp. andigena) in five contrasting environments in Peru. Model estimates for potato X potexvirus (PVX), Andean potato mottle comovirus (APMV), potato Y potyvirus (PVY), or potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) were obtained. They were more accurate when temperature-sensitive growth rates were used for heat accumulation than with constant accumulation rates. The bell-shaped relationships obtained between heat accumulation rates and apparent temperature differed for each virus, with optimum heat accumulation rates at 28 degrees C for PVY, and between 18 and 28 degrees C, 20 and 25 degrees C, and 23 and 28 degrees C for PLRV, PVX, and APMV, respectively. With PLRV and PVY data, high precision levels (P < 0.05) were only obtained when the parameter trigger developmental heat was included. This parameter represents a threshold amount of developmental heat accumulated any time temperature fluctuates into the range between developmental cardinal temperatures, before heat becomes effective for the efficiency of autoinfection. This calibration supports EPIVIT's assumptions regarding the influence of temperature on virus behavior in the host plant. With complete verification of this model component, validation is still needed for final confirmation of the model, as well as an elucidation of the biological mechanisms that underlie efficiency of autoinfection and virus behavior at different temperatures by analytical research.","ETH ZURICH,INST PLANT SCI,CH-8092 ZURICH,SWITZERLAND","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","","","Bertschinger, Lukas/HTP-7352-2023; Bertschinger, Lukas/J-9473-2012","","","","",NA,"16","8","8","0","9","AMER PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOC","ST PAUL","3340 PILOT KNOB ROAD, ST PAUL, MN 55121","0031-949X","","","PHYTOPATHOLOGY","Phytopathology","JUL","1995","85","7","",NA,"",NA,"815","819","","10.1094/Phyto-85-815","http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-85-815","","","5","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","RM610",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1995RM61000011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Odontioda George McMahon 'Fortuna' and Lovely Penguin 'Emperor' were grown at constant temperature set points of 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, or 29 degrees C and day/night (12 h/12 h) temperatures of 20/14, 23/17, 26/14, 26/20, 29/23, or 29/17 degrees C. Plants were grown in glass greenhouses under a 12-h photoperiod and a maximum irradiance of 500 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1). Within 6 weeks, heat stress symptoms such as leaf necrosis were observed on plants grown at a day temperature of 26 degrees C or greater regardless of the night temperature. After 20 weeks, 90% or greater of both clones had a VI when grown at a constant temperature of 14 or 17 degrees C. Plants grown at a constant temperature of 17 degrees C had the greatest pseudobulb diameter with a mean increase of 3.5 to 4.0 cm. In all treatments, a minimum pseudobulb diameter was required for uniform inflorescence initiation; pseudobulbs with a diameter of 5.5 cm or greater developed a VI in 93% of plants.

However, theory is unclear as to whether dispersal will provide spatial insurance when environmental conditions are changing directionally. In particular, increased temperatures as a result of climate change are expected to cause synchronous growth or decline across species and communities, and this has the potential to erode the stabilizing compensatory dynamics facilitated by dispersal. Here we report on an experimental test of how dispersal affects the diversity and stability of metacommunities under warming using replicate two-patch pond zooplankton metacommunities. Initial differences in local community composition and abiotic conditions were established by seeding each patch in the metacommunities with plankton and sediment from one of two natural ponds that differed in water chemistry and species composition. We exposed metacommunities to a 2 degrees C increase in average ambient temperature, crossed with three rates of dispersal (none, intermediate, high). In ambient conditions, intermediate dispersal rates preserved diversity and stabilized metacommunities by promoting spatially asynchronous fluctuations in biomass, especially between local populations of the dominant genus, Ceriodaphnia. However, warming synchronized their populations so that these effects of dispersal were lost. Furthermore, because the stabilizing effect of dispersal was primarily due to asynchronous fluctuations between populations of a single genus, metacommunity biomass was stabilized, but dispersal did not stabilize local community biomass. Our results show that dispersal can preserve diversity and provide stability to metacommunities, but also show that this benefit can be eroded when warming is directional and synchronous across patches of a metacommunity, as is expected with climate warming.","[Thompson, Patrick L.; Gonzalez, Andrew] McGill Univ, Dept Biol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Beisner, Beatrix E.] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada","McGill University; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal","Thompson, PL (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Biol, 1205 Docteur Penfield, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.","patrick.thompson@mail.mcgill.ca","Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020; Thompson, Patrick L/B-6213-2012; Gonzalez, Andrew/F-2247-2010","Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Thompson, Patrick L/0000-0002-5278-9045; Gonzalez, Andrew/0000-0001-6075-8081","Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science; NSERC; Vineberg fellowships; Canada Research Chair program","Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science; NSERC(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Vineberg fellowships; Canada Research Chair program(Canada Research Chairs)","We thank Heather McIntosh, Thomas Ingalls, Matthew Mitchell, Marie-Claire St-Jacques, Irene Gregory-Eves, Gregor Fussmann, David Maneli, Mark Romer and Frank Scopelleti for assistance.

Ipomoea hederacea exhibits an adaptive latitudinal cline in leaf shape, which is controlled by a single Mendelian locus: lobed individuals dominate the north with entire-shaped individuals mostly in the south. We test if the following candidate selective agents, suggested by the literature, are responsible for the cline: differential insect herbivory, genetic correlations with other clinal traits like flowering time and growth rate, and thermoregulatory differences. We planted 1680 F-3 individuals, segregating for leaf shape, in the north of I. hederacea's range, where we expected lobed genotypes to have higher fitness. Individuals were assigned to insect removal or control treatments, and we scored herbivory, flowering time, growth rate, leaf temperature, and fitness (seed number). Herbivory, flowering, and growth rate had significant fitness effects, but none differed between leaf shapes. Lobed leaves were consistently warmer at night, but no performance advantage was detected. Finally, we detected no overall fitness differences between leaf shape genotypes, whether we controlled for other traits under selection or not. Our data suggest these candidate selective agents may not be important contributors to the cline, and alternative approaches to understanding the mechanisms maintaining the leaf shape cline in I. hederacea may be necessary.","[Campitelli, Brandon E.; Stinchcombe, John R.] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Stinchcombe, John R.] Univ Toronto, Ctr Anal Genome Evolut & Funct, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada","University of Toronto; University of Toronto","Campitelli, BE (corresponding author), 25 Willcocks St, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.","brandon.campitelli@utoronto.ca","Stinchcombe, John/A-2941-2008","Stinchcombe, John/0000-0003-3349-2964","NSERC Canada","NSERC Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","We thank NSERC Canada.",NA,"62","8","8","1","40","WILEY-BLACKWELL","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Moreover, the extensive and illegitimate burning of crop residues is causing environmental pollution; whereas, these residues could be converted to biochar to benefit soil quality. In this study, the effect of wheat straw biochar (WSB) at rates of 0% (control, CK), 1% (low, LB), 2% (medium, MB) and 4% (high, HB) on soil temperature at different depths (5, 10, 15, and 20 cm) and moisture levels (10 and 20%) was investigated under high soil surface temperature of 50 degrees C and air humidity of 40%. Our data suggested that soil bulk density was inversely, and soil moisture was directly corelated with soil thermal parameters. Moreover, the increasing rate of WSB addition linearly decreased the soil thermal properties. The maximum decrease in soil bulk density at both moisture levels (10% and 20%) was measured in HB treatment compared to respective CKs. The highest decrease in soil thermal conductivity (59.8% and 24.7%) was found under HB treatment in comparison to respective controls (CK10% and CK20% moisture). The soil volumetric heat capacity was also strongly corelated with soil moisture content (r = 0.91). The WSB treatments displayed differential responses to soil temperature. Under 10% soil moisture, temperature of LB, MB and HB treatments was higher as compared to CK at 5-20 cm depth, and MB treated soil had the smallest increase in temperature. At the 15-cm depth, the MB treatment decreased the temperature by 0.93 degrees C as compared to the CK20%. Therefore, the effect of WSB on soil temperature was influenced by soil moisture content, soil depth and WSB application rates. It suggested that MB treatment could be a useful farming practice for mitigating soil temperature fluctuation.","[Xiong, Jibing; Yu, Runhua; Zhu, Fuhai; Zha, Jianfeng] China Univ Min & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Eng, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Islam, Ejazul] Natl Inst Biotechnol & Genet Engn NIBGE, Soil & Environm Biotechnol Div, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Sohail, Muhammad Irfan] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Soil & Environm Sci, Fac Agr, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan","China University of Mining & Technology; Pakistan Institute of Engineering & Applied Science; University of Agriculture Faisalabad","Xiong, JB; Zha, JF (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Eng, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","xiongjib108@163.com; yrh17718150868@163.com; ejazulislam75@yahoo.com; zhufuhai@runrise.cc; Zhajianfeng@cumt.edu.cn; Irfansohail9@gmail.com","Sohail, muhammad Irfan/ABC-7304-2020","Sohail, muhammad Irfan/0000-0001-9687-3567","Fundamental Research Funds for the China Central Universities [2017XKZD13]","Fundamental Research Funds for the China Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This study was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the China Central Universities (Grant No. 2017XKZD13).",NA,"33","10","10","3","24","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2071-1050","","SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","OCT","2020","12","19","",NA,"",NA,"","","8238","10.3390/su12198238","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12198238","","","9","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","ON2PH",NA,"gold, Green Published","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000586549200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Despite the potential importance of natural variability such as diurnal temperature fluctuations, most experimental studies on warming are conducted under stable temperatures. Here, we investigated whether the responses of an aquatic invertebrate grazer (Lymnaea stagnalis) to an increased average temperature differ when the thermal regime is either constant or fluctuates diurnally. Using thermal response curves for several life-history and immune defense traits, we first identified the optimum and near-critically high temperatures that Lymnaea potentially experience during summer heat waves. We then exposed individuals that originated from three different populations to these two temperatures under constant or fluctuating thermal conditions. After 7 days, we assessed growth, reproduction, and two immune parameters (phenoloxidase-like activity and antibacterial activity of hemolymph) from each individual. Exposure to the near-critically high temperature led to increased growth rates and decreased antibacterial activity of hemolymph compared to the optimum temperature, whilst temperature fluctuations had no effect on these traits. The results indicate that the temperature level per se, rather than the variability in temperature was the main driver altering trait responses in our study species. Forecasting responses in temperature-related responses remains challenging, due to system-specific properties that can include intraspecific variation. However, our study indicates that experiments examining the effects of warming using constant temperatures can give similar predictions as studies with fluctuating thermal dynamics, and may thus be useful indicators of responses in nature.","[Salo, Tiina] Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, Finland; [Salo, Tiina] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Salo, Tiina; Kropf, Tabea; Burdon, Francis J.; Seppaelae, Otto] Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Eawag, Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Salo, Tiina; Seppaelae, Otto] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Burdon, Francis J.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Aquat Sci & Assessment, Uppsala, Sweden; [Seppaelae, Otto] Univ Innsbruck, Res Dept Limnol, Mondsee, Austria","Abo Akademi University; Stockholm University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG); Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Innsbruck","Salo, T (corresponding author), Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, Finland.","tsalo@abo.fi","Burdon, Francis/ABC-2827-2020","Burdon, Francis/0000-0002-5398-4993; Salo, Tiina/0000-0002-5409-2612; Seppala, Otto/0000-0001-7902-3069","Eawag discretionary funds","Eawag discretionary funds","Eawag discretionary funds",NA,"46","8","8","2","8","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Although drastic zooplankton biomass reduction had a significant effect on increment width, a delay of a few days in the otolith response was observed. More importantly, a very clear, positive temperature effect on marginal increment width was demonstrated in fish characterized by temperature independent somatic growth. These results indicate that under natural conditions it may be impossible to distinguish increment width changes related to variation in feeding conditions from changes caused by temperature fluctuations. Therefore, it was concluded that marginal otolith increment width analysis could not be used as a recent growth index (I-G) for herring larvae and juveniles exposed to drastic temperature fluctuations. The implication of these results is significant not only for the use of marginal increments as a recent growth index, but also if growth rate backcalculation is to be used as a research method.

They are influenced by the environmental characteristics and attributes of the community, the traits of Bromus species, and the direct and indirect interactions of Bromus with the plant community. Environmental factors, in particular ambient and soil temperatures, have significant effects on the ability of Bromus to establish and spread. Seasonality of precipitation relative to temperature influences plant community resistance to Bromus through effects on soil water storage, timing of water and nutrient availability, and dominant plant life forms. Differences among plant communities in how well soil resource use by the plant community matches resource supply rates can influence the magnitude of resource fluctuations due to either climate or disturbance and thus the opportunities for invasion. The spatial and temporal patterns of resource availability and acquisition of growth resources by Bromus versus native species strongly influence resistance to invasion. Traits of Bromus that confer a priority advantage for resource use in many communities include early-season germination and high growth and reproductive rates. Resistance to Bromus can be overwhelmed by high propagule supply, low innate seed dormancy, and large, if short-lived, seed banks. Biological crusts can inhibit germination and establishment of invasive annual plants, including several annual Bromus species, but are effective only in the absence of disturbance. Herbivores can have negative direct effects on Bromus, but positive indirect effects through decreases in competitors. Management strategies can be improved through increased understanding of community resistance to exotic annual Bromus species.","[Chambers, Jeanne C.] US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Reno, NV 89512 USA; [Germino, Matthew J.] US Geol Survey, Forest & Rangeland Ecosyst Sci Ctr, Boise, ID 83706 USA; [Belnap, Jayne] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Moab, UT 84532 USA; [Brown, Cynthia S.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Bioagr Sci & Pest Management, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Schupp, Eugene W.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [St Clair, Samuel B.] Brigham Young Univ, Plant & Wildlife Sci, Provo, UT 84602 USA","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Colorado State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Brigham Young University","Chambers, JC (corresponding author), US Forest Serv, USDA, Rocky Mt Res Stn, Reno, NV 89512 USA.","jchambers@fs.fed.us; mgermino@usgs.gov; jayne_belnap@usgs.gov; cynthia.s.brown@colostate.edu; eugene.schupp@usu.edu; stclair@byu.edu","St.Clair, Sam/GZA-4592-2022","Brown, Cynthia/0000-0001-8486-7119","","","",NA,"170","41","41","2","36","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0172-6161","","978-3-319-24930-8; 978-3-319-24928-5","SPRINGER SER ENV MAN","Springer Ser.

The software automatically controls the position of each sensor for optimal measurements over elongation of 15 cm with respect to the plant by triggering motors that lift up the LVDT's. Twelve LVDT sensors channels with 4 environmental sensors (temperature, relative humidity and light intensity) monitor the plant growth and environmental conditions. The floral stem growth of Arabidopsis thaliana has been followed in a photoperiod of L:D 12:12 and then followed by continuous light. L:D synchronizes the stem extension rate, with the highest growth rate in the light phase. In continuous conditions, fluctuations of high and low rates persist with a period of similar to 24 h. This property is typical of a system under control of the biological clock.

Suboptimal and supraoptimal temperatures negatively impact growth and photosynthetic performance with a subsequent effect on lipid accumulation. It is generally recognised that lower temperatures trigger an increase in fatty acid desaturation while higher temperatures trigger the opposite reaction. The effect of temperature on lipid classes has been less studied in microalgae and in certain cases, the effect of light cannot be completely excluded. In this research, the effect of temperature on growth, photosynthesis, and lipid class accumulation in Nannochloropsis oceanica was studied at a fixed light gradient with a constant incident light intensity (670 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). A turbidostat approach was used to achieve temperature acclimated cultures of Nannochloropsis oceanica. Optimal growth was found at 25-29 degrees C, while growth was completely arrested at temperatures higher than 31 degrees C and lower than 9 degrees C. Acclimation to low temperatures triggered a decrease in absorption cross section and photosynthesis rates with a tipping point at 17 degrees C. Reduced light absorption was correlated with a decrease in content of the plastid lipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol. The increase of diacylglyceryltrimethylhomo-serine content at lower temperatures indicated a relevant role of this lipid class in temperature tolerance. Triacylglycerol content increased at 17 degrees C and decreased at 9 degrees C emphasising a metabolic switch in stress response. Total and polar eicosapentaenoic acid content remained constant at 3.5 and 2.4% w/w, despite the fluctuating lipid contents. Results show an extensive mobilisation of eicosapentaenoic acid between polar lipids classes at 9 degrees C to ensure cell survival under critical conditions.","[Ferrer-Ledo, Narcis; Stegemueller, Lars; Janssen, Marcel; Wijffels, Rene H.; Barbosa, Maria J.] Wageningen Univ & Res, Bioproc Engn, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wijffels, Rene H.] Nord Univ, Fac Biosci & Aquaculture, Bodo, Norway","Wageningen University & Research; Nord University","Barbosa, MJ (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Bioproc Engn, Wageningen, Netherlands.","maria.barbosa@wur.nl","","Stegemuller, Lars Sebastian/0000-0001-8978-8882","European Union [745754]","European Union(European Commission)","This work was supported by the project entitled Microalgae As a Green source for Nutritional Ingredients for Food/Feed and Ingredients for Cosmetics by cost effective New Technologies (MAGNIFICENT), funded by the Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program from the European Union (grant agreement: 745754).",NA,"79","0","0","3","3","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-462X","","","FRONT PLANT SCI","Front.

Experiments were conducted on two-year-old seedlings in growth chambers using different combinations of day and night-time temperatures. The first experiment exposed trees to 22/22, 29/22, 22/15, and 29/15 degreesC day/night (d/n). When measured at a common temperature (15, 22 or 29 degreesC), respiration rates were lower for trees exposed to higher treatment temperatures and acclimation was influenced by both day and night-time temperature. However, the extent of acclimation did not relate to mean temperature, i.e. respiration rates measured at a common temperature ranked as follows for seedlings exposed to different temperature regimes, 22/15 > 22/22 > 29/15 congruent to 29/22 degreesC d/n. Rather, acclimation of foliar respiration was linearly related to mean daily respiration rate, where mean daily respiration rate is the average of the respiration rates measured at the day and night-time treatment temperatures. The discrepancy between mean daily respiration rate and mean daily temperature occurred because respiration increased exponentially with increasing temperature. In a second experiment, the same seedlings were exposed to 22/22, 15/15, 25.5/18.5, and 25.5/15 degreesC d/n to test the relationship between mean daily respiration rate and acclimation. As in the first experiment, acclimation was linearly related to mean daily respiration rate. The concept of effective acclimation temperature, which is the temperature at which the mean daily respiration rate occurs, was derived from these results as a means to predict the extent that foliar respiration acclimates to treatment temperature.","Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA","University System of Georgia; University of Georgia","Will, R (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forest Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","","Will, Rodney/G-8111-2011","Will, Rodney/0000-0002-4649-8858","","","",NA,"19","19","22","0","12","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0022-0957","","","J EXP BOT","J.

The effect of temperature on light-limited growth of E. zodiocus was examined at 13 irradiance levels (5-350 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) in combination with five temperatures (8.0-25.0 degrees C). The results showed that all the parameters of growth-irradiance curves, such as the maximum growth rate half saturation constant (Ks) threshold value of irradiance (I-o) and saturation irradiance for growth (S), increased with increasing temperature. On the basis of the relationship between temperature and growth-irradiance curves and seasonal fluctuation of the light environment in Harinia-Nada, the effect of irradiance on the population dynamics of E. zodiacits during the period from October to March was evaluated using two indices, depth of the threshold irradiance for growth (D-t) and depth where a half of its maximum growth rate is attained (D-k). D-1 and Dk remained almost stable from October to December, but gradually increased in early March. This indicates that the rang of depth at which E. zodiactis wasable to grow increased markedly in early spring when E. zodiacus blooms in Harinia-Nada. As the vegetative cells of E. zodiacus tend to distribute in relatively deeper water layers, where growth is limited by irradiance, the increase in the depth range over which E. zodiacits is able to grow is concluded to be an important factor allowing development of its blooms.

However, the effect of temperature fluctuation on phytoplankton is rarely considered. We analyzed the effect of fluctuating temperature on cyanobacterial dominance and blooms in spring (March-May) with long-term data analyses, laboratory simulation, and field observation. Our results showed that the magnitude of air temperature fluctuation in spring has increased in Lake Taihu over the past 58 years (1956-2013) and was negatively correlated with cyanobacterial blooms onset time (1987-2013). Air temperature fluctuation was one of the predictors of the best model for the variability in the bloom size in spring (2000-2011). The results from the field observation (2009-2013) also indicated that there was a positive correlation between diel air temperature difference and the ratio of cyanobacteria to total algae. Laboratory experiments suggested that water temperature fluctuation slowed the growth rates of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Cyclotella meneghiniana but not Microcystis aeruginosa, which confirmed our findings of field observation and long-term data analysis. Therefore, the increased temperature fluctuation under global warming may promote cyanobacterial dominance. Our findings provide further understanding of inter-annual difference of cyanobacterial blooms onset time in the warming world.","[Zhang, Min; Yu, Yang; Yang, Zhen; Shi, Xiaoli; Kong, Fanxiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qin, Baoli] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Biodivers & Biotechnol, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS; Nanjing Normal University","Zhang, M (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, 73 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","mzhang@niglas.ac.cn; fxkong@niglas.ac.cn","yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022",", Min/0000-0002-8130-5214","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31200353, 31470520, 31200296, 310702420]; project of water pollution control and treatment in Lake Taihu [JSZC-G2013-257]; Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, CAS [NIGLAS2012135010]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); project of water pollution control and treatment in Lake Taihu; Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","We thank Dr. Hongtao Duan for the assistance in achieving the data sets of cyanobacterial blooms onset time and area.

However, studies on the effect of temperature on phytoplankton have mainly focused on constant temperatures. It is necessary to clarify the determining parameters of phytoplankton shifts during temperature increases, as temperatures are predicted to fluctuate more intensively and frequently in the future. In the study, we analyzed the responses of photosynthetic properties and growth in a cyanobacterium (Microcystis aeruginosa) and a green alga (Chlorella pyrenoidosa), the dominant species in Taihu, to rapid increasing-temperature process in the laboratory and in the field. The results show that gradually increasing temperature inhibited photosynthesis and the growth of C. pyrenoidosa and had almost no effect on M. aeruginosa. Elevated increasing temperature range also had more significant effects on the photosynthetic properties and growth rates of C. pyrenoidosa than those of M. aeruginosa in the laboratory and in the field. All of these results suggest that the photosynthetic performance of M. aeruginosa is more suitable to gradually increasing temperature and relatively strong temperature variations than that of C. pyrenoidosa, which might partially contribute to Microcystis excluding Chlorella competitively in aquatic ecosystem.

Variation in climate is predicted to increase over much of the planet this century. Forecasting species persistence with climate change thus requires understanding of how populations respond to climate variability, and the mechanisms underlying this response. Variable rainfall is well known to drive fluctuations in annual plant populations, yet the degree to which population response is driven by between-year variation in germination cueing, water limitation or competitive suppression is poorly understood. 2. We used demographic monitoring and population models to examine how three seed banking, rare annual plants of the California Channel Islands respond to natural variation in precipitation and their competitive environments. Island plants are particularly threatened by climate change because their current ranges are unlikely to overlap regions that are climatically favourable in the future. 3. Species showed 9 to 100-fold between-year variation in plant density over the 5-12 years of censusing, including a severe drought and a wet El Nino year. During the drought, population sizes were low for all species. However, even in non-drought years, population sizes and per capita growth rates showed considerable temporal variation, variation that was uncorrelated with total rainfall. These population fluctuations were instead correlated with the temperature after the first major storm event of the season, a germination cue for annual plants. 4. Temporal variation in the density of the focal species was uncorrelated with the total vegetative cover in the surrounding community, suggesting that variation in competitive environments does not strongly determine population fluctuations. At the same time, the uncorrelated responses of the focal species and their competitors to environmental variation may favour persistence via the storage effect. 5. Population growth rate analyses suggested differential endangerment of the focal annuals. Elasticity analyses and life table response experiments indicated that variation in germination has the same potential as the seeds produced per germinant to drive variation in population growth rates, but only the former was clearly related to rainfall. 6. Synthesis. Our work suggests that future changes in the timing and temperatures associated with the first major rains, acting through germination, may more strongly affect population persistence than changes in season-long rainfall.","[Levine, Jonathan M.; Cowan, Clark] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [McEachern, A.

Relative growth rates of I. aristatum var. glaucum shoots and individuals showed a significantly ascending gradient in the order of control, mown, and burnt zones.

Results showed that invasive B. alba had significantly greater total biomass and relative growth rate, accompanied by higher net photosynthetic rate (Pn), than native B. biternata at both low and high temperature extremes. The reduction in Pn for B. alba was mainly caused by stomatal limitations, but for B. biternata it was caused by non-stomatal factors, indicating that greater damage to physiological processes may occur in native B. biternata under both low and high temperature stress. Higher cyclic electron flow around photosystem I in invasive B. alba than in native B. biternata under extreme temperatures might alleviate the negative effect of temperature extremes to photosynthetic and thus promote its photosynthetic efficiency. To conclude, the invasive B. alba has both greater cold and heat tolerance than its native congener B. biternata, suggesting that the invader may outperform native species under future extreme temperature conditions.","[Yue, Mao-Feng; Ye, Wan-Hui; Shen, Hao; Wang, Zhang-Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Bot, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yue, Mao-Feng; Feng, Li] Guangdong Acad Agr Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab High Technol Plant Protect, Inst Plant Protect, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Feng, Li] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Feng, Li] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Plant Resources, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Flory, S.

We know that organisms respond better to severe stresses (triggering stress) when they have experienced a similar milder stress (priming stress) before. Asking how long organisms can remember a priming event is a compelling question. We here studied priming by temperature stress in filamentous fungi isolated from the same grassland soil. We hypothesized that filamentous fungi can show priming responses, and that their memory-spans correlate with their growth rates. Fungal colonies of 19 different filamentous fungi were first primed at 35 degrees C for 5 h (as priming stress) and after 0, 6, 12, 24 or 48 h they were exposed to 40 degrees C for 10 h (as triggering stress). The variable lag time between the stress applications allowed us to assess memory. Our main response variable was growth rate. Of the 19 fungal isolates tested, eight showed temperature priming ability. The Mucoromycotina isolates (Mortierellales) showed a mean growth increase following triggering stress that was 2.75-fold higher than in unprimed colonies (log-response-ratio). Mucoromycotina isolates had a memory half-life span (power-law-relationships) of 5.65 h. Considering fungal traits like growth rate to predict priming responses, we found a positive relationship between priming response (with 12 h memory phase) and growth rate. The differential ability to be primed in co-occurring isolates may have direct consequences for fungal communities and coexistence in soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

Warming because of climate change will likely exceed the physiological optima of tropical insects, which currently live very close to their thermal optima. Tropical insects will be negatively affected if their optima are exceeded otherwise warming may affect them positively. We evaluate the demographic responses of the cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora, to summer warming in subtropical and tropical Taiwan, and examine the effects of diel temperature oscillation on these responses. Aphids were reared at four temperatures (current summer mean, +1.4, +3.9 and +6.4 degrees C), the latter three simulating different levels of warming. At each average temperature, aphids experienced constant or oscillating (from -2.9 to +3.6 degrees C of each mean temperature) regimes. As the simulated summer temperatures increased, so did the negative effects on life-history traits and demographic parameters. Compared with aphids reared in constant temperatures, aphids reared in oscillating temperatures developed more slowly and had a longer mean generation time, but their net reproductive rate was higher. These findings demonstrate that climate warming will affect demographic parameters and life-history traits differentially. Studies that use constant temperatures are unlikely to accurately predict biotic responses to climate change.","[Chen, Chia-Yu; Chiu, Ming-Chih; Kuo, Mei-Hwa] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Entomol, Taichung 40227, Taiwan","National Chung Hsing University","Kuo, MH (corresponding author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Entomol, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.","mhkuo@dragon.nchu.edu.tw","","Chiu, Ming-Chih/0000-0003-2793-4981","","","",NA,"48","23","26","0","46","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND","0007-4853","","","B ENTOMOL RES","Bull.

In this context, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration can alter plant responses to excess salinity, as shown by studies exposing plants to high concentration of NaCl (osmotic shock) in controlled conditions under constant irradiance and temperature. These experiments, however, may not reflect the conditions that occur in natural environments. Here, we studied the impact of progressively imposed salt stress on tomato plant biomass, hormone biosynthesis and primary metabolism under elevated CO2 concentration with fluctuating irradiance and temperature. Na+ concentration and Na+: K+ ratios in plant tissues were increased by high salinity under both ambient and elevated CO2 concentration. Elevated CO2 led to enhanced growth in tomato plants under salt stress through stimulation of photosynthesis and reduced concentrations of abscisic acid and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid in both leaves and roots. Furthermore, whereas high salinity reduced the concentration of Krebs Cycle intermediates and increased the concentration of photorespiratory metabolites glycine and serine, all were restored to control levels by elevated CO2. Our results demonstrate a beneficial effect of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration for crops and reveal new interactions in the physiological network controlling salinity stress responses.","[Brito, Fred A.

In this study, the thermal optimums for heat-shock response and the levels of Hsp70 in Rotaria rotatoria (bdelloid rotifer) under different stress conditions were evaluated using survival assays and western blotting with fluorescent detection. The results showed that: (1) The survivorship in R. rotatoria were 100% throughout the temperature range of 12 degrees C to 40 degrees C, and the population growth rate reached its culmination at 28 degrees C, suggesting the retardation of growth and reproduction at the other temperatures; (2) While stressed under 40 degrees C, the levels of Hsp70 in R. rotatoria increased significantly over time, correlating with the duration of the stress; (3) As responses to different temperatures, the synthesis of Hsp70 could be induced significantly in R. rotatoria under both of high (40 degrees C) and low (16 degrees C) temperatures; (4) After removal of the thermal stress and recovery at 28 degrees C, the levels of Hsp70 continued to rise for a period of time, peaked at 12 h, and then slowly declined with the extension of recovery duration, until there is no significant difference of Hsp70 levels. Summarily, with the fluctuations of stress duration and temperature, the rotifers could adapt to the environments sensitively by regulating the synthesis of Hsp70.","[Xiang, Xian-Ling; Jiang, Rui-Ming; Chen, Ying-Ying; Ge, Ya-Li; Wen, Xin-Li; Xi, Yi-Long] Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Xian-Ling; Ge, Ya-Li; Wen, Xin-Li; Xi, Yi-Long] Key Lab Biot Environm & Ecol Safety Anhui Prov, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China","Anhui Normal University","Xiang, XL (corresponding author), Anhui Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Xiang, XL (corresponding author), Key Lab Biot Environm & Ecol Safety Anhui Prov, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China.","xiangxianling@163.com","xiang, xianling/AFP-0538-2022; Xiang, Xian-Ling/Q-6388-2018","xiang, xianling/0000-0002-1378-5877; Xiang, Xian-Ling/0000-0002-1378-5877","Natural Science Foundation of China [31200324, 31470015]; Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (CN) [1708085MC79]; Foundation of Provincial Key Laboratory of Conservation and Utilization for Important Biological Resource in Anhui","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (CN)(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); Foundation of Provincial Key Laboratory of Conservation and Utilization for Important Biological Resource in Anhui","We thank the editors and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments that greatly improved the manuscript.

In response, algae respond to environmental changes dynamically, adjusting light energy capture strategies, physiological processes and cell cycle control. It is thus the combination of environmental conditions and biological responses that determines the performance of the algae. In contrast, much algal research is performed under artificially static laboratory environments, where different constraints determine performance. Consequently, algal strains selected for mass production in the laboratory may fail to perform well or outcompete local algal strains under outdoor production conditions. To address these issues, we have developed a novel environmental photobioreactor (ePBR), designed to mimic lighting from natural pond environments while controlling key environmental parameters including temperature, pH and CO2 levels, mixing, and culture density. Natural lighting is simulated by illuminating from the top of a columnar culture vessel with a single high power white LED. This combination of lighting and geometry provides light intensities up to full sunlight at the culture surface, with light attenuation through the culture column similar to that observed in race ways or high rate algal ponds. Environmental parameters can be imposed in complex sequences with high time resolution via a user-programmable scripting language. Multiple ePBR units can be networked to perform parallel experiments, enabling semi-high throughput operations. In this report, we demonstrate the utility of this system by showing that fluctuating environmental conditions in ePBR significantly impact algal growth. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The pattern of extension of the shoots derived from the three most distal buds of 100 parent shoots was registered. Weekly measurements and observations of extending shoots were carried out during the 1996-1997 growth season. The date of shoot extension initiation was less variable than the date of shoot extension cessation. Extension curves had an asymmetrically sigmoid outline. Most extension took place uninterruptedly between mid-September 1996 and the end of January 1997. Extension rate reached its highest value in the second half of the extension period. Leaf unfolding rate had a peak early in the extension period and fluctuated irregularly later on. The apical meristem of all shoots died by the end of shoot extension. In general terms, shoot length, diameter, leaf number and extension duration decreased from the first to the third position from the parent shoot's apex, although exceptions to this pattern were found. Shoot extension rate was affected by maximum and minimum daily temperatures but not by the amount of precipitation during the extension period. The size of a bud was not related to the size of the shoot derived from it. The size of shoots in the third position from the apex was related to parent shoot size; this was not the case for more distal shoots.","Univ Nacl Comahue, Ctr Reg Bariloche, Dept Bot, CONICET, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional del Comahue","Stecconi, M (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Comahue, Ctr Reg Bariloche, Dept Bot, CONICET, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.","stecconi@crub.uncoma.edu.ar","","","","","",NA,"62","18","25","0","6","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0931-1890","1432-2285","","TREES-STRUCT FUNCT","Trees-Struct.

Previous field studies have shown that leaf traits varied greatly and were restricted to the lower-investment and faster-return end of the global leaf spectrum, which are typical characteristics of fast-growing species. However, it is unclear as to the mechanism underpinning the growth potential of these species and how it will respond to soil nutrient availability and temperature. Here, we linked the plant functional traits of four representative dominant C-4 herbaceous species (Setaria viridis, Echinochloa crusgalli, Cynodon dactylon and Hemarthria altissima) to their relative growth rates (RGR) under ambient and elevated temperatures, with different nitrogen and phosphorus levels, to explore the potential mechanism of species growth in the newly established reservoir riparian ecosystem in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. We grew seedlings of these species in four open-top chambers, with three levels of nutrient supplies under two temperature gradients (ambient temperature and an elevated temperature of 4 degrees C). We found that the responses of the RGR and plant traits to soil N and P supply levels and temperature varied considerably among studied species. E. crusgalli displayed the lowest RGR associated with relatively low specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen content (LN), stem mass ratio (SMR), and high leaf mass ratio (LMR) and was less affected by soil N and P supply levels and temperature. C. dactylon and H. altissima showed the highest RGR compared to the other two species grown at the substrate of N = 0.4 mg/g, P = 0.2 mg/g at ambient air temperature, associated with a relatively high SMR, low LMR and low plant carbon content (PCC). However, the RGR advantage of the two species was diminished at elevated temperatures, while S. viridis showed the highest RGR compared to the other species. Across all datasets, the RGR had no association with the leaf area ratio (LAR) and SLA. The RGR also showed no significant relationships with the LN and leaf phosphorus content (LP). On the other hand, the RGR was captured adequately by the SMR, which can therefore be considered as a powerful functional marker of species' functioning in this newly established reservoir riparian ecosystem. Our study provides some insight into the underlying mechanisms of species growth in reservoir riparian ecosystems.","[Xiong, Gaoming; Zhang, Wangfeng] Shihezi Univ, Xinjiang Prod & Construct Corps, Key Lab Oasis Ecoagr, Shihezi, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Gaoming; Zhang, Aiying; Fan, Dayong; Ge, Jielin; Yang, Dan; Xie, Zongqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing, Peoples R China","Shihezi University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS","Zhang, WF (corresponding author), Shihezi Univ, Xinjiang Prod & Construct Corps, Key Lab Oasis Ecoagr, Shihezi, Peoples R China.","zhwf_agr@shzu.edu.cn","","fan, dayong/0000-0002-2591-6029; Ge, Jielin/0000-0002-7330-5628","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC050310102]; Special Program for Basic Work of Science and Technology of China [2015FY1103002-2]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Special Program for Basic Work of Science and Technology of China","National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFC050310102; Special Program for Basic Work of Science and Technology of China, Grant/Award Number: 2015FY1103002-2",NA,"60","6","6","4","29","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

Gracilaria tenuistipitata showed an euryhaline growth response. In all salinities G. tenuistipitata had the ability to increase the pH of the cultivation medium to above pH 9 (up to pH 10) and still maintain growth rates up to 47% d-1 when the cultures were aerated with ordinary air. The algae were able to grow at a high pH only if they were allowed to increase the pH by photosynthetic inorganic-carbon uptake from the cultivation medium. With addition of CO2 to the culture and the pH controlled to 8 the growth rate reaches over 60% d-1 during short periods. In the absence of pH control the pH fluctuated strongly when ammonium was used as nitrogen source but the pH was more stable when using nitrate. The influence of pH increase of the medium and the resulting low CO2 concentration on the activity of cabonic anhydrase (EC 4.2.1.1.) was studied. The relative activity of carbonic ahydrase increased when the cultures were aerated with CO2-free air. When the cultures were supplied with high concentrations of CO2 a slight decrease in carbonic-anhydrase activity was observed. The results suggest that the concentration Of CO2 in the medium influences the carbonic-anhydrase activity of the alga.","","","HAGLUND, K (corresponding author), UNIV UPPSALA,DEPT PHYSIOL BOT,POB 540,S-75121 UPPSALA,SWEDEN.","","","","","","",NA,"49","39","41","0","4","WALTER DE GRUYTER & CO","BERLIN","GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY","0006-8055","","","BOT MAR","Bot.

The effect of temperature on the outcome of resource competition between two planktonic rotifers (Synchaeta pectinata and Brachionus calyciflorus) was investigated in laboratory experiments. In addition to the competition experiments, several physiological variables and their temperature-dependence were characterised, including ingestion rate and starvation tolerance. 2. Because of a lower threshold food level (TFL) for population growth for the food algae Cryptomonas erosa, Synchaeta was predicted to be the superior competitor at low temperatures (12 degrees C). In contrast, Brachionus had a lower TFL at 20 degrees C and was predicted to be competitively superior at this temperature. 3. In both rotifer species, ingestion rates increased with temperature, but the increase was much more pronounced in Brachionus. Ingestion rates of Brachionus at temperatures from 8 to 24 degrees C were always higher than in Synchaeta (up to 4.6-fold). 4. Starvation resistance reduced with temperature in both rotifer species. At all temperatures investigated (12,16 and 20 degrees C) Brachionus could survive starvation for longer than Synchaeta. This difference was strongest at 12 degrees C (5.8 days versus 2.5 days). 5. In the first competition experiment, food was supplied at 48 h-intervals. Brachionus displaced Synchaeta at both experimental temperatures (12 and 20 degrees C). Competitive exclusion of Synchaeta at the lower temperature was probably because of large fluctuations in algal densities that resulted from the long intervals between feeding, a condition that favoured Brachionus because of its higher starvation resistance. 6. In the second competition experiment, one third of the food suspension was renewed every 8 h, resulting in a much better approximation to a continuous resource supply. At 12 degrees C Synchaeta and Brachionus coexisted for more than I month and the densities of both rotifer species were significantly lower in the presence of their competitor. In contrast to expectations, Brachionus was able to persist even when Cryptomonas concentrations fell below its TFL. This was probably because Brachionus was using detritus and associated bacteria as additional food sources, which were present in the cultures during the later phase of the experiment. 7. Autocorrelation analysis of the temporal changes in egg ratios revealed significant periodic cycles in Synchaeta during the second competition experiment. A possible explanation for this is the fecundity schedule of Synchaeta, in which reproduction is highly concentrated in a few age classes. According to demographic theory, such a life cycle feature can cause slower convergence to a stable age distribution.","Max Planck Inst Limnol, Dept Physiol Ecol, D-2320 Plon, Germany","Max Planck Society","Stelzer, CP (corresponding author), Austrian Acad Sci, Inst Limnol, Mondseestr 9, A-5310 Mondsee, Austria.","claus-peter.stelzer@oeaw.ac.at","Stelzer, Claus-Peter/F-3789-2018","Stelzer, Claus-Peter/0000-0002-6682-0904","","","",NA,"36","10","10","0","16","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0046-5070","1365-2427","","FRESHWATER BIOL","Freshw.

In this study, we investigate thermal effects on feeding, digestion, and net energy intake for Melanoplus bivittatus, the two-striped grasshopper In the field, M, bivittatus maintained body temperatures (T-b's) between 32 degrees C and 38 degrees C throughout most of a sunny day, but T-b's dropped to 0 degrees -15 degrees C at night. The threshold T-b for feeding in the field was 25 degrees C but was 15 degrees C when grasshoppers were kept without food for 12 h at 35 degrees C. Variables determined by the ability of the digestive tract to process food (food intake and fecal production per 8 h) were more temperature sensitive (Q(10)'s of 4-5) than variables reflecting chewing and crop-filling rates (Q(10)'s of 2-2.5). Higher T-b strongly increases net energy intake primarily by increasing digestive tract throughput in M. bivittatus, augmenting rates of individual development opment, and population expansion. The grasshopper's digestive system was essentially nonfunctional during half of its normal day in the field, implying that adaptation to high T-b's constrains digestive function at low T-b's.","","","HARRISON, JF (corresponding author), ARIZONA STATE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,TEMPE,AZ 85287, USA.","","","","","","",NA,"34","55","58","1","31","UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","CHICAGO","5720 S WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637","0031-935X","","","PHYSIOL ZOOL","Physiol.

Temperature elevation scenarios used were: (1) an asymmetric 0.3 degreesC/0.9 degreesC increase in day/night temperature (T+ 0.3/0.9) as observed since the turn of the century; (2) a symmetric 4 degreesC elevation during both day and night periods (T+ 4) as predicted by general circulation models; and (3) an asymmetric 2 degreesC/6 degreesC elevation of day/night temperature (T+ 2/6), TREGRO incorporates temperature effects on photosynthesis, respiration, growth rate, and phenology. In both species for all temperature elevation scenarios, respiratory increases exceeded photosynthetic increases and reduced belowground growth. In yellow-poplar, belowground growth was reduced by 7.6% in the T+ 0.3/0.9 scenario, whereas the T+ 4 and T+ 2/6 scenarios reduced belowground growth by 145% and 155%, respectively. The elevated temperature scenarios increased total tree biomass of loblolly pine, but belowground growth was reduced by 24%, 111%, and 113% by the T+ 0.3/0.9, T+ 4, and T+ 2/6 scenarios, respectively. Reductions in root biomass at elevated temperatures may influence competitive interactions between forest tree species and susceptibility to environmental fluctuations.","Univ Colorado, Dept Epo Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Cornell Univ, Boyce Thompson Inst Plant Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Cornell University; Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research","Constable, JVH (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Biol Sci, 845 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"43","3","3","1","7","SOC AMER FORESTERS","BETHESDA","5400 GROSVENOR LANE, BETHESDA, MD 20814 USA","0015-749X","","","FOREST SCI","For.

In turn, fluctuations in zooplankton as prey may have consequences for reproductive decisions and performance of planktivorous seabirds. We examined interrelationships between mean seasonal oceanographic conditions and prey availability and the timing of breeding, nestling diet, growth and productivity (as number of chicks fledged per breeding pair) of Cassin's auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus in the central California Current System. Substantial inter-annual variability in seasonal ocean climate parameters as well as in auklet reproductive and diet characteristics was evident. Hatching dates and the proportion of all euphausiids in the diet were positively correlated with seasonal sea-surface temperature and negatively correlated with seasonal upwelling values, A significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of Euphausia pacifica in the diet and hatch date, while significant positive correlations were found between Thysanoessa spinifera in the diet and productivity, and between productivity and growth. Based on the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations euphausiid data set, significant positive correlations were found between E. pacifica abundance and auklet meal mass and productivity and between T spinifera abundance and auklet productivity. As demonstrated by the auklet diet, euphausiids responded to changes in ocean climate on multiple temporal scales. In most years, auklets responded adaptively to variation in oceanographic conditions and prey availability by modifying timing of breeding. However, in years when ocean conditions deteriorated after the initiation of breeding, prey availability was severely reduced beyond the anklet's adaptive response, resulting in diminished nestling growth and productivity.","PRBO Conservat Sci, Marine Ecol Div, Stinson Beach, CA 94970 USA","","Abraham, CL (corresponding author), PRBO Conservat Sci, Marine Ecol Div, 4990 Shoreline Highway, Stinson Beach, CA 94970 USA.","cabraham@prbo.org","Bond, Alexander L/A-3786-2010","","","","",NA,"64","101","103","0","29","INTER-RESEARCH","OLDENDORF LUHE","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","0171-8630","1616-1599","","MAR ECOL PROG SER","Mar.

Early authors pointed to dry summers as the trigger; around 1980, the explanation was improved via modelling of historical data. The number of precipitation days and the July temperature proved to be important, and in experiments, moist soil caused considerable mortality. This information was used in preliminary forecasting with pheromone trap catches as biofix for estimations of occurrence and survival. As more precise information on temperature effects on growth and survival was needed, we performed experiments on growth and mortality effects on egg, all larval instars and pupae. We found clear positive relations between temperatures below 35 degrees C and development rates of eggs, all larval instars and pupae. Mortality was also affected, and low temperature caused pronounced mortality of young larvae. The severe mortality under cold, moist conditions versus high survival under warm, dry conditions may explain both the lack of relation between captures and injuries and the pronounced fluctuations of cutworm attacks in NW Europe reported from 1905 to present. These variations are likely to increase with the climate change and suggest a reanalysis of data on trap capture and injuries to improve decision support and sustainability in Integrated Pest Management.","[Esbjerg, Peter; Sigsgaard, Lene] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark","University of Copenhagen","Esbjerg, P (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.","pe@plen.ku.dk; les@plen.ku.dk","Sigsgaard, Lene/F-7182-2014; Sigsgaard, Lene/GQQ-6286-2022","Sigsgaard, Lene/0000-0001-6478-5079; Sigsgaard, Lene/0000-0001-6478-5079","","","",NA,"44","5","5","1","14","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","2075-4450","","","INSECTS","Insects","JAN","2019","10","1","",NA,"",NA,"","","7","10.3390/insects10010007","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects10010007","","","15","Entomology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Entomology","HJ5DN","30621348","Green Submitted, Green Published, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000457198700007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It was found that no significant change in pollutant concentrations (including COD, NH4 +-N, TN and TP) was observed during this time, and their average values were close to those of the original reclaimed water. However, turbidity and algal contents fluctuated temporally in the direction of river flow. Statistical analysis showed that turbidity was strongly positively correlated with algal contents for flow rate < 0.1 m . s (-1), whereas it was strongly positively correlated with both algal contents and TOC for flow rate > 0.1 m . s (-1). It was observed that diatom was the absolute predominant phyla with Melosira as the major species. In terms of algal bloom control, the specific growth rate of algae was strongly correlated to temperature, and was influenced by flow rate as well. Compared with two other rivers originated with reclaimed water and one originated with natural water, the ShannonWiener index in the objective river was the lowest, with values between 0.7 and 1.6, indicating a high risk for algal bloom. Statistics showed that Shannon-Wiener index was strongly negatively correlated to nutrient salts and cations.

Here we show that nighttime temperatures affect the growth of the hypocotyl of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings not only during the night but also during the subsequent photoperiod. Active phytochrome B (phyB) represses nighttime growth and warm temperatures reduce active phyB via thermal reversion. The function of PHOTOPERIODIC CONTROL OF HYPOCOTYL1 (PCH1) is to stabilise active phyB in nuclear bodies but, surprisingly, warmth reduces PCH1 gene expression and PCH1 stability. When phyB was active at the beginning of the night, warm night temperatures enhanced the levels of nuclear phyB and reduced hypocotyl growth rate during the following day. However, when end-of-day far-red light minimised phyB activity, warm night temperatures reduced the levels of nuclear phyB and enhanced the hypocotyl growth rate during the following day. This complex growth pattern was absent in the phyB mutant.

Improving the long-term storage of L. migratoria eggs will help promote the large-scale rearing of this insect. We assessed multiple fitness parameters and enzyme activities of locusts emerged from eggs exposed to 4 A degrees C for 1-4 wk. Locusts emerged from eggs stored at 4 A degrees C for 2 wk showed significantly improved development and reproduction compared with locusts emerged from eggs stored for other time periods. The preimaginal survival rate increased significantly after 2-wk storage while it decreased significantly after 4-wk storage compared with other storage times. The fecundity, hatching rate, and growth rate increased significantly after 2-wk storage, but decreased significantly after 1, 3, and 4 wk compared with the control. However, the preimaginal developmental duration decreased significantly after 2-wk storage but increased significantly after storage for 1, 3, and 4 wk compared with the control.

One usually estimates ICUE based on the net photosynthetic rate or the assumed proportional relationship between growth efficiency and ICUE. However, thus far, protocols for easily estimating annual TCUE remain problematic. Here, we present a theoretical framework (based on the metabolic scaling theory) to predict whole-plant annual TCUE by directly measuring instantaneous net photosynthetic and respiratory rates. This framework makes four predictions, which were evaluated empirically using seedlings of nine Picea taxa: (i) the flux rates of CO2 and energy will scale isometrically as a function of plant size, (ii) whole-plant net and gross photosynthetic rates and the net primary productivity will scale isometrically with respect to total leaf mass, (iii) these scaling relationships will be independent of ambient temperature and humidity fluctuations (as measured within an experimental chamber) regardless of the instantaneous net photosynthetic rate or dark respiratory rate, or overall growth rate and (iv) TCUE will scale isometrically with respect to instantaneous efficiency of carbon use (i.e., the latter can be used to predict the former) across diverse species. These predictions were experimentally verified. We also found that the ranking of the nine taxa based on net photosynthetic rates differed from ranking based on either ICUE or TCUE. In addition, the absolute values of ICUE and TCUE significantly differed among the nine taxa, with both ICUE and temperature-corrected ICUE being highest for Picea abies and lowest for Picea schrenkiana. Nevertheless, the data are consistent with the predictions of our general theoretical framework, which can be used to access annual carbon-use efficiency of different species at the level of an individual plant based on simple, direct measurements. Moreover, we believe that our approach provides a way to cope with the complexities of different ecosystems, provided that sufficient measurements are taken to calibrate our approach to that of the system being studied.","[Wang, Zhiqiang; Ji, Mingfei; Deng, Jianming; Ran, Jinzhi; Zhang, Qiang; Fan, Zhexuan; Zhang, Xiaowei; Li, Jiangtao; Huang, Heng] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Milne, Richard I.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Mol Plant Sci, Edinburgh EH9 3JH, Midlothian, Scotland; [Cheng, Dongliang] Fujian Normal Univ, Coll Geog Sci, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Niklas, Karl J.] Cornell Univ, Dept Plant Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Lanzhou University; University of Edinburgh; Fujian Normal University; Cornell University","Deng, JM (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.","dengjm@lzu.edu.cn","jiangtao, li/HTL-7510-2023; Niklas, Karl/AAV-4760-2021","","Chinese National Basic Research Program [2014CB954203]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31000286, 31270753, 30930072, 31170374]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [lzujbky-2012-k23]; Ministry of Education of China [109152]; Key Special Project of Gansu Province [2010GS04130]","Chinese National Basic Research Program(National Basic Research Program of China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Key Special Project of Gansu Province","This study was supported by grants from Chinese National Basic Research Program (2014CB954203), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31000286, 31270753, 30930072 and 31170374), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University to J.D., Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (lzujbky-2012-k23), Key Project of Ministry of Education of China (109152) and Key Special Project of Gansu Province (2010GS04130).",NA,"56","15","15","2","49","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0829-318X","1758-4469","","TREE PHYSIOL","Tree Physiol.","JUN","2015","35","6","",NA,"",NA,"599","607","","10.1093/treephys/tpv030","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpv030","","","9","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","CM7RK","25939866","Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000357893400003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Cell division and cell elongation occurred in the first 20 and 60 mm after the ligule, respectively, at all temperatures. Similar quantitative responses to temperature were observed for local cell division and local tissue expansion rates (common x intercept and normalized slope), and both responses were spatially uniform over the whole expanding zone (common time courses in thermal time).

In variable environments, different species may be favored through time, which can influence both the nature of trait evolution and the ecological dynamics underlying community composition. To determine how fluctuating environmental conditions favor species with different physiological traits over time, we combined long-term data on survival and fecundity of species in a desert annual plant community with data on weather and physiological traits. For each year, we regressed the standardized annual fitness of each species on its position along a tradeoff between relative growth rate and water-use efficiency. Next, we determined how variations in the slopes and intercepts of these fitness-physiology functions related to year-to-year variations in temperature and precipitation. Years with a relatively high percentage of small rain events and a greater number of days between precipitation pulse events tended to be worse, on average, for all desert annual species. Species with high relative growth rates and low water-use efficiency had greater standardized annual fitness than other species in years with greater numbers of large rain events. Conversely, species with high water-use efficiency had greater standardized annual fitness in years with small rain events and warm temperatures late in the growing season. These results reveal how weather variables interact with physiological traits of co-occurring species to determine interannual variations in survival and fecundity, which has important implications for understanding population and community dynamics.","[Kimball, Sarah] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Environm Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Gremer, Jennifer R.; Huxman, Travis E.; Venable, D.

Direct seeded rice has been proved as a the best alternative to transplanted rice and has been adopted successfully in many regions over the globe. This study was carried out to evaluate the productivity of rice sown under different environments with precision hill-direct-seeding method. Four rice varieties viz. Peizataifeng, Yuxiangyouzhan, Huahang 31 and Huayou 213 were sown in 6 different environments (E1-E6) by following split-plot design with four replications. Results showed that environments (E), varieties (V) and their interactions (E x V) significantly (p <= 0.01) affected seedling survival rate, grain yield and yield related traits like panicles m(-2), spikelets panicle(-1) (p <= 0.05), fully filled grain %, 1000-grain weight, harvest index as well as daily dry matter and grain productivity. Differential varietal response under different environments depicted that all environments remained productive regarding rice growth and yield except environment 3 (E3) that caused grain yield reduction up to 45.86%. The overall performance and yield response of rice varieties under different environments was recorded as: Huahang 31. Yuxiangyouzhan. Peizataifeng. Huayou 213. Further, correlation analysis showed significant and positive relationships of rice grain yield with yield contributing factors (r > 0.47) except panicles m(-2) and grains panicle(-1). Hence, fluctuations in regional/ local climatic conditions may cause shifts in sowing/planting times, poor stand establishment and seedlings survival rates that may lead to yield penalty in rice.","[Mo, Z.

The xanthophyll cycle was common in all species examined and was functional throughout the year. In semi-deciduals, the maximum midday values for conversion state, defined as the ratio (zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin)/(violaxanthin + zeaxanthin + antheraxanthin), and the maximum xanthophyll pool sizes, expressed on a Chl basis, were recorded during the dry summer, indicating that the period of water shortage may be the most demanding for a high photoprotective potential. However, the data suggests that sclerophylls may also need a high photoprotective potential during winter, since the xanthophyll pool sizes were equally high during both summer and winter. Corresponding spring and autumn values were low. Furthermore, winter pre-dawn conversion state values were the highest recorded amongst all species studied, indicating that the mildly low winter temperatures may be a considerable stress factor for these plants. It is assumed that by preserving high concentrations of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin overnight, sclerophylls retain high energy dissipation activity early in the morning, when minimum temperatures, coinciding with high photon fluence rates, are likely to drive the photosynthetic apparatus to potentially harmful overexcitation. Of significance may be the fact that almost all species show a minimum in chlorophyll content during the summer. In this way, overexcitation is alleviated and the photoprotective action of carotenoids per chlorophyll molecule is enhanced.","Univ Patras, Dept Biol, Lab Plant Physiol, Patras 26500, Greece","University of Patras","Manetas, Y (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Biol, Lab Plant Physiol, Patras 26500, Greece.","y.manetas@upatras.gr","Kyparissis, Aris/G-6010-2017","Kyparissis, Aris/0000-0002-3156-4963","","","",NA,"31","81","84","1","12","CSIRO PUBLISHING","CLAYTON","UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA","0310-7841","","","AUST J PLANT PHYSIOL","Aust.

To help in attaining a comprehensive and thorough understanding of the ecological tolerances of G. molesta, we collected life history data of individuals reared on apples under different constant temperature regimes and compared the data with moths reared under a variable outdoor temperature environment. Because G. molesta individuals reared at a constant 25 degrees C had the heaviest pupal weight, the highest survival rate from egg to adult, highest finite rate of increase, and greatest fecundity, 25 degrees C was considered as the optimum developmental temperature. The G. molesta population reared at a constant 31 degrees C had the shortest development time, lowest survival rate and fecundity, resulting in population parameters of r < 0, lambda < 1, lead to negative population growth. The population parameters r and lambda reared under fluctuating temperature were higher than that reared under constant temperatures, the mean generation time (T) was shorter than it was in all of the constant temperatures treatments. This would imply that the outdoor G. molesta population would have a higher population growth potential and faster growth rate than indoor populations raised at constant temperatures. G. molesta moths reared under fluctuating temperature also had a higher fertility than moths reared under constant temperatures (except at 25 degrees C).

Hyphal growth was enhanced at 20 degrees, 25 degrees and 30 degrees C in GE, and at 25 degrees, 30 degrees and 35 degrees C in GM. 2. Under constant bed soil of 20 degrees, 25 degrees and 30 degrees C for 8 weeks after inoculation, there was no growth enhancement at 20 degrees C regardless of the AM fungus species; whereas at 25 degrees and 30 degrees C, the GE- and GM-inoculated plants were taller than the noninoculated plants. At 30 degrees C, the GM-inoculated plants were taller than those inoculated with GE. At 25 degrees C, the GE-or GM-inoculated plants had the most shoots and storage roots than did those at other temperatures. The rate of AM fungus-infected portions in a whole root system (as percentage of the total portions infected with AM fungus in a whole root system) was maximum at 25 degrees C in GE-inoculated plants but at 25 degrees and 30 degrees C in GM-inoculated ones. 3. Under the bed soil temperature conditions diurnally fluctuating in the range of 25 degrees C to 15 degrees C and 30 degrees C to 18 degrees C, 8 weeks after inoculation, the plants were taller and had more numerous shoots and storage roots in GE-inoculated plants than in GM-inoculated ones in a regime between 25 degrees C and 15 degrees C; the reverse was noted in a regime between 30 degrees C and 18 degrees C. Little difference in the rate of AM fungus-infected portions in a whole root system was recognized between the two temperature regimes in GE-inoculated plants, whereas in GM-inoculated ones, the rate became higher at the temperature fluctuated between 30 degrees C and 18 degrees C than it did at the temperature fluctuated between 25 degrees C and 15 degrees C.

The two regimes, 15/5-degrees-C and 9/5-degrees-C day maximum/night minimum temperatures, simulated soil temperatures differences between tilled vs. heavy-residue, no-till conditions, respectively, observed during early spring in eastern Washington. Previous field experiments indicated that some of the Nordic genotypes accumulated more N and dry matter than the PNW cultivars during early spring under no-till conditions. The objective of this experiment was to determined whether these differences 1) are dependent on the temperature of the rooting environment, and 2) are correlated with genotypic differences in NH4+ and NO3-uptake. Overall, shoot N and dry matter accumulation was reduced by 40% due to lower root temperatures during illumination. Leaf emergence was slowed by 14 to 22%, and tiller production was also inhibited. All genotypes absorbed more ammonium than nitrate from equimolar solutions, and the proportion of total N absorbed as NH4+ was slightly higher in the 9/5-degrees-C than the 15/5-degrees-C regime. A Finnish genotype, HJA80201, accumulated significantly more shoot N than the PNW cultivars. 'Clark' and 'Steptoe', and also more than a Swedish cultivar, 'Pernilla', in the 9/5-degrees-C regime. In the 15/5-degrees-C regime Steptoe did not differ in shoot N from the Nordic genotypes, while Clark remained significantly lower. These differences were not correlated to relative propensity for N form. Root lengths of the Nordic genotypes were significantly greater than the PNW genotypes grown under the 9/5-degrees-C regime, while the root lengths in the warmer root temperature regime were not significantly different among genotypes. Higher root elongation rates under low soil temperature conditions may be an inherent adaptive mechanism of the Nordic genotypes. Overall, the data indicate that lower maximum daytime temperatures of the soil surface layer likely account for a significant portion of the growth reductions and lower N uptake observed in no-till systems.","DEPT UNIV ALASKA,PALMER,AK 99645","","PAN, WL (corresponding author), WASHINGTON STATE UNIV,DEPT CROP & SOIL SCI,PULLMAN,WA 99164, USA.","","","","","","",NA,"29","5","5","0","8","KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL","DORDRECHT","SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0032-079X","","","PLANT SOIL","Plant Soil","AUG","1991","135","1","",NA,"",NA,"1","8","","10.1007/BF00014773","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014773","","","8","Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture; Plant Sciences","FY022",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1991FY02200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, studies on the effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations on organisms, especially the effects on specific life stages, are still limited. We examined the immediate effects of the same average temperature (25 degrees C) and different temperature amplitudes (+/- 4, +/- 6, +/- 8, +/- 10, +/- 12 degrees C) on the development and survival of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). We also assessed carry-over effects on adult longevity, reproduction, development, and survival of offspring across generations. The effect of moderate temperature amplitudes was similar to that of constant temperature. Wide temperature amplitudes inhibited the development of pupae, reduced total reproduction, lowered intrinsic rates of population growth, and slowed the development and survival of eggs on the first day, but the proportion of females ovipositing on the first three days increased. Insects coped with the adverse effects of wide temperature amplitudes by laying eggs as soon as possible. Our results confirmed that a logistic model based on daily average temperature cannot predict development rates under wide temperature amplitudes. These findings highlight the effect of environmental temperature fluctuations at the pupal stage on the development and oviposition patterns of P. xylostella and should be fully considered when predicting field occurrence.","[Xing, Kun; Zhao, Fei] Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Shanxi Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Agr, Taiyuan 030031, Peoples R China; [Xing, Kun; Sun, Dongbao; Zhao, Fei] Shanxi Shouyang Dryland Agroecosyst Natl Observat, Shouyang 031700, Peoples R China; [Sun, Dongbao] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China","Shanxi Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Institute of Environment & Sustainable Development in Agriculture, CAAS","Zhao, F (corresponding author), Shanxi Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Shanxi Key Lab Integrated Pest Management Agr, Taiyuan 030031, Peoples R China.;Zhao, F (corresponding author), Shanxi Shouyang Dryland Agroecosyst Natl Observat, Shouyang 031700, Peoples R China.","zhaofei12@126.com","","Zhao, Fei/0000-0003-4158-3604","Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province [201701D121113, 2015011075]; Foundation in Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences [YBSJJ1703, YBSJJ1512, YYDZX16, YCX2018D2BH5]; Province Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi [201903D211001-2]","Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province); Foundation in Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Province Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi","We thank Chen Kang for assistance in completing experiments.

Growth trajectories (otolith backcalculated mean standard length of 5 day intervals from 5 days after hatch to 24 days) as well as the most recent 5 day mean growth rate of larvae before capture (G(5)) differed among months. Growth trajectories showed the same pattern as G(5). In IA, mean +/- S.D. G(5) ranged from 0.31 +/- 0.04 mm day(-1) (January) to 0.73 +/- 0.06 mm day(-1) (October). In OA, mean +/- S.D. G(5) ranged from 0.36 +/- 0.05 mm day(-1) (January) to 0.79 +/- 0.11 mm day(-1) (August). G(5) values declined from November to January and then started to increase. In general, the seasonal patterns of growth were similar between IA and OA, and a clear seasonal pattern in growth was identified. When the relationships among larval growth rate, sea temperature, zooplankton density and larval density were examined, growth rate was positively related with sea temperature in both areas and not related with the other factors. The similar pattern in growth observed between IA and OA was probably due to the low spatial variability in sea temperature compared to its seasonal variability.

To determine the effect of the investigated factors and their interaction on culture concentration, pigment content, and photosynthetic parameters of cyanobacterium, factorial experiments and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were carried out. Both chlorophyll (Chl) a and phycobilins (PB) were influenced by the irradiance and temperature, but stronger effect was noted in the case of the former one. Chl a and PB concentration per 100 mu m of filament dropped above 4-fold with the increasing irradiance. The ratios between individual carotenoids [beta-carotene, zeaxanthin, and myxoxanthophyll (Myx)] and Chl a increased significantly with an increase in the irradiance. The greatest fluctuations were observed in the ratio of Myx to Chl a (above 10-fold). Thus, Myx was suggested as the main photoprotective carotenoid in G. amphibium. Based on photosynthetic light response (PI) curves, two mechanisms of photoacclimation in G. amphibium were recognized: a change of photosynthetic units (PSU) number and a change of PSU size. These two mechanisms constituted the base of significant changes in photosynthetic rate and its parameters, such as the compensation point (P (C)), the initial slope of photosynthetic curve (alpha), saturation irradiance (E (K)), maximal photosynthetic rate (P (max)), and dark respiration rate (R (D)). The greatest changes were observed in P (C) values (about 15-fold within the range of the factors tested). Studied parameters showed a wide range of changes, which might indicate G. amphibium ability to acclimatize well to irradiance and temperature, and indirectly might explain the successful growth of cyanobacterium in dynamically changing environmental conditions.","[Jodlowska, S.; Latala, A.] Univ Gdansk, Inst Oceanog, Lab Marine Plant Ecophysiol, PL-81378 Gdynia, Poland","Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk","Jodlowska, S (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Inst Oceanog, Lab Marine Plant Ecophysiol, Pilsudskiego Av 46, PL-81378 Gdynia, Poland.","ocesm@univ.gda.pl","","Latala, Adam/0000-0001-7241-2213; Latala, Adam/0000-0001-6092-887X","Council for Science - Poland [6 PO4F 117 21, 3 PO4F 027 23]; University of Gdansk [BW/1320-5-0170-9, BW/1320-5-0075-2]","Council for Science - Poland; University of Gdansk","This study was supported by research grants from the Council for Science - Poland (6 PO4F 117 21, 3 PO4F 027 23) and by the University of Gdansk (BW/1320-5-0170-9, BW/1320-5-0075-2).",NA,"52","18","20","0","113","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0300-3604","1573-9058","","PHOTOSYNTHETICA","Photosynthetica","JUN","2013","51","2","",NA,"",NA,"202","214","","10.1007/s11099-013-0019-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11099-013-0019-0","","","13","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","135IU",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000318282600004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the spatial variability in dwarf shrub growth responses in this remote region remains largely unknown. This study characterizes temperature sensitivity of radial growth of two willow dwarf shrub species from two distinct High Arctic sites. The dwarf shrub Salix arctica from Northern Greenland (82 degrees N), which has a dry continental High Arctic climate, is linked with Salix polaris from central Svalbard (78 degrees N), which experiences a more oceanic High Arctic climate with relatively mild winters. We found similar positive and significant relationships between annual growth of both Salix dwarf shrub species and July-August air temperatures (1960-2010), despite different temperature regimes and shrub growth rates at the two sites. Also, Salix dwarf shrub growth was significantly negatively correlated with Arctic and North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) indices; S. arctica from Northern Greenland was negatively correlated with previous autumn (AO index) and current summer AO and NAO indices, and S. polaris with the summer NAO index. The results highlight the importance of both local and regional climatic drivers for dwarf willow shrub growth in harsh polar desert habitats and are a step in the direction of identifying and scaling changes in plant growth across the High Arctic.","[Buchwal, Agata] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Geoecol & Geoinformat, B Krygowskiego 10, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Weijers, Stef] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, Meckenheimer Allee 166, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Blok, Daan] Lund Univ, Dept Phys Geog & Ecosyst Sci, Solvegatan 12, S-22362 Lund, Sweden; [Elberling, Bo] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Permafrost CENPERM, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark","Adam Mickiewicz University; University of Bonn; Lund University; University of Copenhagen","Buchwal, A (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Geoecol & Geoinformat, B Krygowskiego 10, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland.;Elberling, B (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Permafrost CENPERM, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Oster Voldgade 10, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark.","kamzik@amu.edu.pl; be@ign.ku.dk","Buchwal, Agata/F-5516-2013; Weijers, Stef/T-8944-2019; Elberling, Bo/M-4000-2014; Blok, Daan/E-1649-2011","Buchwal, Agata/0000-0001-6879-6656; Weijers, Stef/0000-0003-3386-5417; Elberling, Bo/0000-0002-6023-885X; Blok, Daan/0000-0003-2703-9303","Danish National Research Foundation [CENPERM DNRF100]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [N N306 009139]; Scientific Exchange Program Sciex [09.045]","Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond); Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland); Scientific Exchange Program Sciex","Field work in Greenland (BE) was funded by a grant from the Danish National Research Foundation (CENPERM DNRF100) and the field work in central Spitsbergen (AB) was funded by Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (grant number N N306 009139).

Potted plants were inoculated with B. lactucae, incubated at 13 C for 12 or 24 h to initiate infection, and subjected to different temperature treatments by moving them to growth chambers operating at diurnally alternating temperatures, moving them outdoors to naturally varying temperatures, or holding them at constant conditions. Subsets of plants incubated at fluctuating temperatures were returned to constant conditions at 24-h intervals to simulate a wide range in thermal exposure during the latent period. Cumulative numbers of sporulating lesions were recorded for each plant daily from 5 to 14 days after inoculation. Minimum and median latent periods (LP(0) and LP(50), respectively) were determined for each cultivar and temperature treatment at the end of the experiments. LP(0) and LP(50) were expressed as days, in degree-hours (accumulated hourly temperatures above a threshold of 0 C), and in units of accumulated hourly developmental rates derived from a nonlinear function fit to values of LP(0) from a previous constant-temperature study. We found that the variability in LP(0) and LP(50) was greater when latent periods were measured in degree-hours (coefficient of variation [CV] between 6.2 and 30.9%) or developmental rates (6.4% less than or equal to CV less than or equal to 48.6%) than when they were measured in days (4.0% less than or equal to CV less than or equal to 17.5%). Thus, there seems to be little advantage in using degree-hours or developmental rates to model latent periods of lettuce downy mildew.

Here we assessed the influence of environmental and culture variables on productivity of Cladophora coelothrix at multiple scales, firstly in an operational settlement pond and subsequently in laboratory and flow-through mesocosm experiments. Classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were used to partition the influence of key variables on growth. In situ productivity correlated primarily with nitrogen concentration, position in the pond and stocking density, with a lesser influence of salinity, temperature and the ratio of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) and total ammonium nitrogen (TAN). We subsequently evaluated the resilience of C. coelothrix in laboratory and mesocosm environments by manipulating salinity, temperature and nutrients across a broader range of values derived from a year-long survey of the settlement pond. Here temperature had the greatest influence on growth, followed by nitrogen concentration and salinity. Growth rates of C. coelothrix were high, irrespective of season, except at the extremes of each season, for example, at the lowest annual temperature and with the combination of high temperature and low salinity. Growth was also limited by similar to 20% when NO3--N and TAN were available simultaneously. The use of CART analyses for both in situ and controlled environment data provided a formal dissection of the relative contribution of each environmental variable to growth, demonstrating the year-round potential for bioremediation and identifying the critical combinations of environmental variables for management of this system.","[Silva, Pedro H. de Paula; de Nys, Rocky; Paul, Nicholas A.] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","James Cook University","Silva, PHD (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.","pedro.depaulasilva@my.jcu.edu.au","de Paula Silva, Pedro/G-8860-2013; de Nys, Rocky/D-6741-2012; Paul, Nicholas/B-6496-2009","de Nys, Rocky/0000-0003-3869-4928; Paul, Nicholas/0000-0002-9275-1535","Advanced Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (AMCRC); Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centre Scheme; AMCRC PhD scholarship","Advanced Manufacturing Cooperative Research Centre (AMCRC)(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centre Scheme(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme); AMCRC PhD scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme)","This research is part of the MBD Energy Research and Development program for Biological Carbon Capture and Storage.

In this study, we examined the influence of salinity, light intensity, temperature and nitrate concentration on growth rates and adenosine content in batch cultures of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin. A strong negative correlation was found between growth rate, as a function of both salinity and light, and adenosine content. Growth rate as a function of temperature and nitrate did not correlate with adenosine content. In silico and empirical tests revealed an apparent lack of adenosine degradation in P. tricornutum and from these analyses, we suggest that adenosine content reflects the balance between its formation from S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolysis and AMP dephosphorylation, and its consumption by phosphorylation to AMP. The high and varying adenosine levels in the growth and stationary phases could be an important physiological adaptation to support the cellular energy charge for the cells to survive in highly fluctuating environments. Adenosine content in microalgae could also be an important parameter to describe physiological responses to different growth conditions when optimizing growth conditions to increase valuable microalgal products, such as lipids for feed in aquaculture or as biofuels.","[Prestegard, Siv Kristin; Knutsen, Gjert] Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Bergen, Norway; [Herfindal, Lars] Univ Bergen, Haukeland Univ Hosp, Dept Biomed, Bergen, Norway","University of Bergen; University of Bergen; Haukeland University Hospital","Prestegard, SK (corresponding author), Univ Bergen, Dept Biol, Bergen, Norway.","siv.prestegard@bio.uib.no","","","Norwegian Research Council [139710/140]; Western Norway Regional Health Authority","Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Western Norway Regional Health Authority","This research was supported by the Norwegian Research Council (Grant no. 139710/140) and the Western Norway Regional Health Authority.

Even though woody plants are known to be competent to reach FHmax when preconditioned at low temperatures in late autumn, it is not known the proper temperature to reach FHmax for different species and cultivars. That knowledge is needed for their use in different cultivation zones in Finland however. We examined the effect of different preconditioning temperatures (3, -3, -7 and -10 degrees C) and their durations (one or three weeks) on FH of two cultivars of apple (Malus domestica), three cultivars of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) and three cultivars of blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum) to find out the condition for reaching FHmax. FH was assessed by controlled freezing tests at different temperatures. Frost damage was determined by electrical impedance (EIS), relative electrolyte leakage (REL) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) of stems, and by visual damage scoring (VD) of stems and buds. In apple, FH of stems was at the highest (-43 degrees C) at a preconditioning temperature of -7 degrees C and the lowest (-18 degrees C) at 3 degrees C as assessed by REL and EIS respectively. By DTA, low temperature exotherm (LTE) was observed at the lowest at around -40 degrees C in both apple cultivars after preconditioning at -7 degrees C. The highest level of FH in blueberry (from -39 degrees C to -45 degrees C) and in blackcurrant (from -39 degrees C to -50 degrees C) was found in all cultivars after preconditioning at -3 degrees C or -7 degrees C by EIS and REL. Some additional hardening especially in apple and blueberry was found with prolonged preconditioning for 3 weeks. FH estimates of stem by EIS and REL were quite similar, whereas VD typically under-estimated it as compared to EIS and REL. DTA results have minimal fluctuations compared to other methods. The use of DTA for blackcurrant is limited due to the low occurrence rate of LTE.","[Wu, Dongxia; Heinonen, Jaakko; Repo, Tapani] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Nat Resources, POB 68, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland; [Wu, Dongxia; Pappinen, Ari] Univ Eastern Finland, Fac Forest Sci, POB 111, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland; [Wu, Dongxia] Hebei Agr Univ HEBAU, Fac Hort, Baoding 071000, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Luoranen, Jaana; Pulkkinen, Pertti] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Prod Syst, POB 2, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland; [Kukkonen, Sanna] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Prod Syst, Survontie 9A, FI-40500 Jyvaskyla, Finland","Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Eastern Finland; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)","Wu, DX (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Nat Resources, POB 68, FI-80101 Joensuu, Finland.","dongxia.wu@luke.fi","","Finni, Sanna/0000-0002-3600-0577; Wu, Dongxia/0000-0003-1703-8710","Hebei Agriculture University (HEBAU); Natural Resource Institute Finland (Luke) [41007-00101900]; University of Eastern Finland (UEF)","Hebei Agriculture University (HEBAU); Natural Resource Institute Finland (Luke); University of Eastern Finland (UEF)","We thank Pauliina Palonen, Tuuli Haikonen, Gang Zhang and Jian Sun for their support, and Matti Savinainen, Eija Koljonen, Seija Repo and the staff of Luke's Piliddo and Suonenjoki Units for their technical assistance during the experiment.

This pattern is not universal, and certain taxa are increasing in abundance and distribution. A better understanding of population dynamics and range expansions in different areas and how different taxa respond to changing temperatures is therefore important, as we are facing a warmer and more fluctuating climate in the future. In this study, we show that range-expanding moths in southeastern Sweden have increased their species richness over time and that abundance and population growth increase during years with higher temperatures. We also show that population growth in range-expanding moths is fastest in the first years after establishment in an area. These shifts in distribution and abundance of moths may lead to rapid and dramatic changes in community compositions, with potentially widespread consequences for species interactions and ecosystem functioning. Parallel to the widespread decline of plants and animals, there is also an ongoing expansion of many species, which is especially pronounced in certain taxonomic groups and in northern latitudes. In order to inform an improved understanding of population dynamics in range-expanding taxa, we studied species richness, abundance and population growth in a sample of 25,138 individuals representing 107 range-expanding moth species at three light-trap sites in southeastern Sweden over 16 years (from 2005 to 2020) in relation to temperature and years since colonisation. Species richness and average abundance across range-expanding moths increased significantly over time, indicating a continuous influx of species expanding their ranges northward. Furthermore, average abundance and population growth increased significantly with increasing average ambient air temperature during the recording year, and average abundance also increased significantly with increasing temperature during the previous year. In general, population growth increased between years (growth rate > 1), although the population growth rate decreased significantly in association with years since colonisation. These findings highlight that, in contrast to several other studies in different parts of the world, species richness and abundance have increased in southeastern Sweden, partly because the warming climate enables range-expanding moths to realise their capacity for rapid distribution shifts and population growth. This may lead to fast and dramatic changes in community composition, with consequences for species interactions and the functioning of ecosystems. These findings are also of applied relevance for agriculture and forestry in that they can help to forecast the impacts of future invasive pest species.","[Betzholtz, Per-Eric; Forsman, Anders; Franzen, Markus] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, SE-39182 Kalmar, Sweden","Linnaeus University","Betzholtz, PE (corresponding author), Linnaeus Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, SE-39182 Kalmar, Sweden.","per-eric.betzholtz@lnu.se","","","","","",NA,"54","0","0","3","3","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2075-4450","","INSECTS","Insects","JAN","2023","14","1","",NA,"",NA,"","","55","10.3390/insects14010055","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects14010055","","","11","Entomology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Entomology","7Z5LC","36661983","gold, Green Published","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000915599700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The model was calibrated with growth chamber data covering one infection cycle and validated with field data from Ecuador. The model provided a good fit to all data sets evaluated. There was a significant interaction between average temperature and amplitude in their effects on the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) as predicted from growth chamber data on a single infection cycle.

Rising winter temperatures from global warming can drive increases in outbreaks of some agricultural pests. In contrast, here we propose an alternative hypothesis that both extremely cold and warm winters can mismatch the timing between the eclosion of overwintering pests and the flowering of key host plants. As host plants normally need higher effective cumulative temperatures for flowering than insects need for eclosion, changes in flowering time will be less dramatic than changes in eclosion time, leading to a mismatch of phenology on either side of the optimal winter temperature. We term this the seesaw effect. Using a long-term dataset of the Old World cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in northern China, we tested this seesaw hypothesis by running a generalized additive model for the effects of the third generation moth in the preceding year, the winter air temperature, the number of winter days below a critical temperature and cumulative precipitation during winter on the demography of the overwintering moth. Results confirmed the existence of the seesaw effect of winter temperature change on overwintering populations. Pest management should therefore consider the indirect effect of changing crop phenology (whether due to greenhouse cultivation or to climate change) on pest outbreaks. As arthropods from mid- and high latitudes are actually living in a cooler thermal environment than their physiological optimum in contrast to species from lower latitudes, the effects of rising winter temperatures on the population dynamics of arthropods in the different latitudinal zones should be considered separately. The seesaw effect makes it more difficult to predict the average long-term population dynamics of insect pests at high latitudes due to the potential sharp changes in annual growth rates from fluctuating minimum winter temperatures.","[Reddy, Gadi V.

The plant was monitored over a 1.5-year period; operational parameters were evaluated daily and their impact on process rates assessed together with the characteristics of the wastewater sampled at different points in the treatment scheme. The results showed that instability problems and a periodic failure of nitrification/denitrification occurred due to a series of reasons, often persisting simultaneously and having an additive synergetic effect. Factors whose magnitude would be insufficient to affect the performance of a plant treating domestic wastewater, eg; small deviations from the optimal pH in nitrification or denitrification basins, a temperature decrease to 17degreesC or an increase of the influent nitrogen content, caused the plant's efficiency to drop from 100% to 40% in some periods. To ensure stable performance, the dilution rate, D, along with the sludge retention time were shown to be key parameters for the control of the process. Maintaining values of D considerably lower than critical theoretical values calculated from the specific growth rate of nitrifiers at a given temperature and sludge recycle ratio may prevent problems in the plant's performance, particularly when high fluctuations of the concentration of inflow solids make calculation of the sludge age uncertain and proper sludge management difficult.

In partnership with BBC Terrific Scientific, over 50 primary schools from around the UK grew spring onions outside of hydroponic growth chambers that they constructed. Over 2 weeks, students measured the height of the spring onions daily, while the hourly temperature and visibility data were determined for each school based on the UK Meteorological Office data. This rich time series data allowed us to model how plants integrate temperature and light signals to determine how much to grow, using techniques from functional data analysis. We determined that under nutrient-poor hydroponic conditions, growth of spring onion is sensitive to even a few degrees change in temperature, and is most correlated with warm nighttime temperatures, high temperatures at the start of the experiment, and light exposure near the end of the experiment. We show that scientists can leverage schools to conduct experiments that leverage natural environmental variability to develop complex models of plant-environment interactions.","[Brestovitsky, Anna] Univ Cambridge, Sainsbury Lab, Cambridge, England; [Brestovitsky, Anna; Ezer, Daphne] Alan Turing Inst, London, England; [Brestovitsky, Anna; Ezer, Daphne] Univ Warwick, Dept Stat, Coventry, W Midlands, England","University of Cambridge; University of Warwick","Ezer, D (corresponding author), Alan Turing Inst, London, England.","dezer@turing.ac.uk","","","Alan Turing Institute Research Fellowship under EPSRC Research grant [TU/A/000017]; EPSRC Innovation Fellowship [EP/S001360/1]; UKRI Research Strategic Priority Fund [R-SPES-107]; EPSRC [EP/S001360/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Alan Turing Institute Research Fellowship under EPSRC Research grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC Innovation Fellowship(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); UKRI Research Strategic Priority Fund; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC))","Alan Turing Institute Research Fellowship under EPSRC Research grant, Grant/Award Number: TU/A/000017; EPSRC Innovation Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: EP/S001360/1; UKRI Research Strategic Priority Fund, Grant/Award Number: R-SPES-107",NA,"20","4","4","1","7","JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD","CHICHESTER","THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND","","2475-4455","","PLANT DIRECT","Plant Direct","MAR","2019","3","3","",NA,"",NA,"","","126","10.1002/pld3.126","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.126","","","11","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","KG4EU","31245769","Green Published, gold, Green Accepted","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000509898800001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Field experiments were carried out at three sites in southern Ethiopia using suckers of several clones to generate crop physiological parameters and to describe the time course of leaf number, leaf area and plant height. Yield potentials at different sites were estimated using these parameters and weather data, and compared with the actual yield. Plant height and LAI increased faster at Awassa and Areka than at Hagereselam because of a higher leaf appearance rate associated with temperatures being closer to the optimum. The trend in plant height was best described by a logistic function, whereas the trend in LAI was best described by a logistic function only at Awassa and Areka. A high leaf appearance rate (0.18 leaves day(-1)) during early growth at Awassa and Areka made it possible that leaves that were senesced during unfavourable climatic conditions could be rapidly replaced without strong fluctuation in leaf area index. At Hagereselam, however, the rate of leaf appearance (0.09 leaves day(-1)) was too small to compensate for the decline in the number of green leaves per plant during adverse conditions and thus LAI fluctuated over the whole growing period. The trend in fraction of PAR intercepted was best described by a generalised logistic function. At 300 days after transplanting the suckers, LAI reached a value of 4.5 and enset clones intercepted 92-97% of incoming PAR. The mean extinction coefficient was between 0.56-0.91 and radiation use efficiency (RUE) ranged from 1.43-2.67 g MJ(-1). Dry matter kocho yield potentials of 17.1 to 33.9 t ha(-1) yr(-1) were estimated for enset clones. Important yield potential differences existed between clones mainly because of differences in radiation use efficiency that was probably partly associated with viral infection. The average ratio of actual yield:yield potential (0.24) was low mainly because of large losses associated with traditional fermentation techniques, yield reducing cultivation methods such as repetitive transplanting and leaf pruning, presence of diseases, lack of adequate fertilisation and shortage and uneven distribution of rainfall.","Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Plant Sci, Crop & Weed Ecol Grp, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands; Debub Univ, Awassa Coll Agr, Awasa, Ethiopia","Wageningen University & Research; Hawassa University","Struik, PC (corresponding author), Univ Wageningen & Res Ctr, Dept Plant Sci, Crop & Weed Ecol Grp, POB 430, NL-6700 AK Wageningen, Netherlands.","","","","","","",NA,"38","10","10","0","4","ASSOC APPLIED BIOLOGISTS","WARWICK","C/O HORTICULTURE RESEARCH INT WELLSBOURNE, WARWICK CV35 9EF, ENGLAND","0003-4746","","","ANN APPL BIOL","Ann.

After 4 days (96 h) of culture, the biomass of H. musciformis showed differences that fluctuated among the areas and temperature treatments. Specifically, the specimens cultivated in 35 A degrees C had low values of ETRmax, alpha(ETR), beta(ETR), and F (v)/F (m) photosynthetic parameters, as well as changes in cell morphology, with reduction in photosynthetic pigments and drastic reduction in growth rates. When combined with the extreme temperatures, high concentrations of ammonium ion in seawater effluent caused an inhibition of photosynthetic activity, as well as significant variation in chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents. As observed by light microscopy, the synergism between different temperatures and pollutants found in eutrophic waters caused changes in cellular morphology with increased cell wall thickening and decreased floridean starch grains. H. musciformis also showed important changes in physiological response to each factor independently, as well as changes resulting from the synergistic interaction of these factors combined. Therefore, we can conclude that extreme temperature combined with the effect of eutrophic waters, especially RUS, caused distinct morphological and physiological changes in the red alga H. musciformis.","[de Faveri, Caroline; Schmidt, Eder C.; Simioni, Carmem; Bouzon, Zenilda L.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Cell Biol Embryol & Genet, Plant Cell Biol Lab, BR-88049900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Schmidt, Eder C.] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Dept Cell Biol Embryol & Genet, Postdoctoral Res Postgrad Program Cell Biol & Dev, BR-88049900 Florianopolis, SC, Brazil; [Martins, Cintia D.

The forcing variables are discharge, river morphology, water temperature, available light and nutrient inputs. Given the description of several algal categories, POTAMON allows to simulate algal successions at a particular site, as well as longitudinal changes of potamoplankton composition and biomass. The algal categories differ by their physiology, their loss rates, and their sensitivity to grazing by zooplankton. Two zooplankton categories were considered, Brachionus-like and Keratella-like. which differ by their clearance rate, their incipient limiting level, their selectivity towards phytoplankton, and their growth yield. The model simulates satisfactorily the onset and the magnitude of the phytoplankton spring bloom in the Belgian part of R. Meuse, the biomass decrease in early summer, and the autumn bloom. It also renders the major variations of algal assemblages along the river. The model allows to confirm that the main driving variables of potamoplankton dynamics in a eutrophic river are physical factors: discharge and related variables (e.g. retention time), light and temperature. In addition, the simulations confirm that the zooplankton-phytoplankton interaction may result in phytoplankton biomass fluctuations and compositional changes. POTAMON can be useful to explore plankton dynamics in a large river, and it may become a tool to test various management measures.

This has resulted in a lack of understanding of how NPQ affects plant productivity and what may drive the adaptation and acclimation of NPQ kinetics and capacity. Thus, the role of thermal dissipation (assessed via its indicator NPQ) at the whole plant and even community scale is an understudied, albeit important topic. Thermal dissipation is by definition a protective process, and yet subject to tight metabolic control. How does regulation of thermal dissipation impact the operational state of photosynthesis? How efficient are the regulatory processes preventing photoinhibition and photooxidative stress? How does the large variation in NPQ dynamics and capacity relate to plant fitness and productivity? Does thermal dissipation impose a cost on photosynthetic rate in fluctuating environments? In this chapter, we address these questions by (1) describing the processes that give rise to thermal dissipation and the measurement of NPQ, (2) the role of thermal energy dissipation at different scales within the plant system, (3) the modulation of thermal energy dissipation capacity according to growth environment, and (4) the development of approaches for understanding how the dynamics of thermal dissipation determine plant fitness and productivity.","[Murchie, Erik H.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Div Plant & Crop Sci, Loughborough LE12 5RD, Leics, England; [Harbinson, Jeremy] Wageningen Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Hort Supply Chains Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands","University of Nottingham; Wageningen University & Research","Harbinson, J (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Hort Supply Chains Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.","jeremy.harbinson@wur.nl","Murchie, Erik/AGU-8921-2022; Murchie, Erik h/G-4074-2013","Murchie, Erik/0000-0002-7465-845X; Murchie, Erik h/0000-0002-7465-845X","","","",NA,"180","12","13","0","7","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1572-0233","","978-94-017-9032-1; 978-94-017-9031-4","ADV PHOTOSYNTH RESP","Adv.

These traits are highly beneficial in the current scenario of global warming. Interestingly, all the genes of the C4 photosynthetic pathway are present in C3 plants, although they are involved in diverse non-photosynthetic functions. Non-photosynthetic isoforms of carbonic anhydrase (CA), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), the decarboxylating enzymes NAD/NADP-malic enzyme (NAD/NADP-ME), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and finally pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) catalyze reactions that are essential for major plant metabolism pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, maintenance of cellular pH, uptake of nutrients and their assimilation. Consistent with this view differential expression pattern of these non-photosynthetic C3 isoforms has been observed in different tissues across the plant developmental stages, such as germination, grain filling, and leaf senescence. Also abundance of these C3 isoforms is increased considerably in response to environmental fluctuations particularly during abiotic stress. Here we review the vital roles played by C3 isoforms of C4 enzymes and the probable mechanisms by which they help plants in acclimation to adverse growth conditions. Further, their potential applications to increase the agronomic trait value of C3 crops is discussed.","[Singh, Jitender; Das, Shubhashis; Thakur, Jitendra Kumar] Natl Inst Plant Genome Res, New Delhi 110067, India; [Garai, Sampurna; Thakur, Jitendra Kumar] Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, New Delhi 110067, India; [Tripathy, Baishnab Charan] Sharda Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Greater Noida 201301, UP, India","Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR); Department of Biotechnology (DBT) India; International Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (ICGEB); International Center for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi; Sharda University","Singh, J; Thakur, JK (corresponding author), Natl Inst Plant Genome Res, New Delhi 110067, India.;Thakur, JK (corresponding author), Int Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, New Delhi 110067, India.;Tripathy, BC (corresponding author), Sharda Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Greater Noida 201301, UP, India.","jitendder@gmail.com; jthakur@icgeb.res.in; baishnabtripathy@yahoo.com","","Singh, Jitender/0000-0003-1281-6675","Govt. of India [DST-SERB-EMR/2016/004976, BT/PR11896/BPA/118/3/2014]; CSIR-SRA fellowship from Government of India [13(9101-A)/2019-pool]","Govt. of India; CSIR-SRA fellowship from Government of India","This work was supported by research Grants No. DST-SERB-EMR/2016/004976 and BT/PR11896/BPA/118/3/2014 from the Govt. of India to BCT.

Five culture conditions including three different sizes of containers (250 mL conical flask, 500 mL beaker, and 20 L jar) in two different environments (out-incubator and incubator) were compared in terms of growth and PSTs production. Compared with the incubator environment, the out-incubator environment had more fluctuations in temperature and light intensity. Results showed that the cell densities of A. minutum increased in all groups, especially in the conical flask (I, out-incubator, 6.29.106 cells/mL) and the beaker (IV, incubator, 7.28.106 cells/mL). When cultured in the 20 L jar under out-incubator condition, the algae had the lowest cell density (2.82.106 cells/mL) but the highest toxicity (93.42. 2.55.10 6 MU/cell). The negative correlation between average growth rate and single-cell toxicity could be explained by biocompatibility, thereby indicating that the low growth rate led to high toxicity. HPLC-FLD showed that the cellular toxicity increased due to the quantitative increase in GTX1/4, which are the more toxic derivatives. The PSTs types consistently contained GTX1/4 and GTX2/3. The differences in algae growth and toxin-production could be due to changes in bacteria (out-incubator) and CO2 (incubator) with vessel size. The effects of environmental factors on algae are strain specific. The out-incubator device can be applied for large-scale cultivation of A. minutum considering the algae density and toxin-producing ability.","[Xie, Wancui; Li, Min; Song, Lin; Hu, Xiaoqun; Yang, Xihong] Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Marine Sci & Biol Engn, Qingdao 266042, Peoples R China; [Xie, Wancui; Song, Lin; Yang, Xihong] Key Lab Biochem Engn Shandong Prov, Qingdao 266042, Peoples R China","Qingdao University of Science & Technology","Yang, XH (corresponding author), Qingdao Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Marine Sci & Biol Engn, Qingdao 266042, Peoples R China.","yangxihong63@163.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31271938, 31772089]; Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong [2017GHY15127]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 31271938 and 31772089, and Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong, grant number 2017GHY15127.

Food web interactions are complex and can respond to environmental changes in unpredictable ways that do not necessarily equate to the individual responses of each of the components of the food web. 2. Biomass can be used to evaluate the productivity of the three individual trophic levels, in the form of the Net Generational Productivity (NGP) and the performance of the entire food web with the newly developed tri-trophic food web performance ratio ((3t)). 3. These parameters were used to evaluate the performance of nine plant-based tri-trophic food webs composed of: potato, Solanum tuberosumL. and two cultivars of bell pepper Capsicum annuumL; three biotypes of the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiaeThomas (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). 4. The NGP showed that the thermal window for biomass productivity for each trophic level is different and is reduced by approximately 4 degrees C with respect to the inferior level. Aphidius ervi had the smallest thermal window for biomass productivity and development. 5. The present results showed that the performance (phi(3t)) of the tested food webs is influenced in a top-down fashion, where the intra-specific variation of the food web, namely the host plant, played a major role in the productivity of each of the subsequent trophic levels. 6. The phi(3t) suggested that exposure to high and low temperatures might severely affect the effectiveness of A. ervi as a biocontrol agent of the aphid M. euphorbiae in bell pepper and potato crops.","[Flores-Mejia, Sandra; Guay, Jean-Frederic; Cloutier, Conrad] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Pavillon Alexandre Vachon,1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Fournier, Valerie] Univ Laval, Dept Phytol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Fournier, Valerie] Univ Laval, Ctr Rech Innovat Vegetaux, Quebec City, PQ, Canada","Laval University; Laval University; Laval University","Flores-Mejia, S (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Pavillon Alexandre Vachon,1045 Ave Med, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.","sandra.flores-mejia.1@ulaval.ca","","","NSERC-Strategic and Discovery Grants; Centre SEVE; Ministere de l'Education, du Loisir et du Sport du Quebec","NSERC-Strategic and Discovery Grants; Centre SEVE; Ministere de l'Education, du Loisir et du Sport du Quebec","We thank RZH Canada Ltd. and Syngenta seeds for graciously providing us with the bell pepper seeds.

If used to solve problems of industrial effluents, the performance of the plant is often unsuccessful, with periodic block of nitrogen removal. The present paper concerns the performance of nitrification/denitrification during a 1.5-year period in a plant treating tannery wastewater. Operational parameters are evaluated on a day-to-day basis and their role, along with pH, temperature, TKN, NH3 concentration and other analytical parameters, which characterise wastewater quality at different points in the treatment scheme, is discussed in reference to process rates. As shown, biological nitrification/denitrification of tannery wastewater is extremely difficult to conduct in a full-scale plant and there may be many reasons for the periodic failure of the system. Only a slight deviation of the optimal pH in nitrification or denitrification basins, a drop in temperature or a high influent nitrogen content are factors whose magnitude would not affect the performance of a plant treating domestic wastewater, but during treatment of industrial effluents they can readily cause system failure. Most often however, it is the concomitant occurrence of several causes that leads to an unsuccessful performance or inhibition of one or more biochemical reactions. In such a complicated situation sludge age can be the key parameter in controlling the plant. Keeping it high, far above the value related to the specific growth velocity for a given temperature, can be a useful tool for preventing problems in plant performance, particularly when high fluctuations in the concentration of inflow solids make a proper sludge management difficult. Furthermore on-line monitoring of wastewater characteristics at key points of the plant can give useful information on the inhibition risk.","Univ Venice, Dept Environm Studies, I-30123 Venice, Italy","Universita Ca Foscari Venezia","Szpyrkowicz, L (corresponding author), Univ Venice, Dept Environm Studies, Dorsoduro 2137, I-30123 Venice, Italy.","","","","","","",NA,"15","1","1","0","2","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","","","1-4020-1718-9","","","","2003",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"271","284","","","","","","14","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology","BY68C",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000189437500025","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Methods are needed to predict how such environmental variation affects ecological and evolutionary processes, in order to design effective strategies to conserve biodiversity under global change. Here, we review recent theoretical and empirical studies to assess: (1) how populations respond to changes in environmental variance, and (2) how environmental variance affects population responses to changes in mean conditions. Contrary to frequent claims, empirical studies show that increases in environmental variance can increase as well as decrease long-term population growth rates. Moreover, environmental variance can alter and even reverse the effects of changes in the mean environment, such that even if environmental variance remains constant, omitting it from population models compromises their ability to predict species' responses to changes in mean conditions. Drawing on theory relating these effects of environmental variance to the curvatures of population growth responses to the environment, we outline how species' traits such as phylogenetic history and body mass could be used to predict their responses to global change under future environmental variability.","[Lawson, Callum R.; van de Pol, Martijn] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Vindenes, Yngvild] Univ Oslo, Dept Biosci, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth CEES, NO-0371 Oslo, Norway; [Bailey, Liam; van de Pol, Martijn] Australian Natl Univ, Div Evolut Ecol & Genet, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); University of Oslo; Australian National University","Lawson, CR (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Anim Ecol, Droevendaalsesteeg 10, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.","c.lawson@nioo.knaw.nl","; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Vindenes, Yngvild/0000-0003-1197-5818; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X; van de Pol, Martijn/0000-0003-4102-4079; Bailey, Liam D./0000-0002-8226-9454","Netherlands Institute of Ecology; British Ecological Society [4154/5048]; Research Council of Norway [NORKLIMA 224738]; Australian Postgraduate Award scholarship; Australian Research Council [FT120100204]; Australian Research Council [FT120100204] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","Netherlands Institute of Ecology; British Ecological Society; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Australian Postgraduate Award scholarship; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","We thank the Editor, Nigel Yoccoz, Jenny Hodgson, Bjorn Rall, Arie van Noordwijk, Kate Lessells, Tom Oliver, Adriaan Dokter, Stephanie Jenouvrier, Nina Mclean, Barbara Tomotani and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments.

P91 steel has been widely utilized in conventional plant components. Creep fatigue crack growth (CFCG) tests have been performed on compact specimens at temperatures ranging between 600 degrees C to 625 degrees C. The experimental results have been compared to static creep, high cycle fatigue and CFCG test data available in literature on P91 steel. The CFCG data has been characterised using stress intensity factor range parameter, Delta K and C* parameter. The crack growth per cycle and Delta K relationship shows that at high frequency, the CFCG behaviour tends to that of high cycle fatigue crack growth and at low frequency, the contribution of creep becomes increasingly more significant. The correlation between crack growth rate and C* parameter, shows that most CFCG data fall within the creep crack growth (CCG) P91 data band which may indicate that the crack growth behaviour is dominated by creep processes. Fractography has also shown an intergranular, ductile fracture surface indicating creep dominance for the conditions considered. A linear cummulative rule has ben used to predict the CFCG experimental result. Copyright (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Ab Razak, N.; Davies, C. M.; Nikbin, K.

Although plant-soil interactions are traditionally studied during the growing season, the highest concentrations of toxic elements in the soil may occur during the winter months. The present study investigated the effects of a 3-month exposure to either an acid or a reference soil, at temperatures fluctuating around freezing point, on subsequent survival and growth of eight herbs (Brachypodium sylvaticum, Carex pilulifera, Geum urbanum, Luzula pilosa, Mycelis muralis, Silene dioica, Stellaria nemorum, Veronica officinalis). The plants were exposed to ambient weather conditions from December to March, after which they were replanted in fresh reference soil and transferred to a glasshouse. Their biomass was measured 5 weeks later. The plant species differed in their responses to the soils, in a manner reflecting their natural field distributions. All plants of the most acid-tolerant species survived in both treatments, whereas the more sensitive species showed lower survival rates after growth in the acid than in the reference soil. Similar results were found for the regrowth: C. pilulifera and L. pilosa, the most acid-tolerant species, were unaffected by the soil treatments (ratios between biomass in acid compared to reference soils were 0.8 and 1.1, respectively), whereas G. urbanum, M. muralis, S. nemorum and V. officinalis were negatively affected (ratios 0.3-0.5). Effects on above- and below-ground biomass were broadly similar. This preliminary evidence indicates that soil chemistry during the winter can be important for both survival and growth during the vegetative period that follows.

In addition to increasing photorespiration, moderately high temperatures (35-42 degreesC) can cause direct injury to the photosynthetic apparatus. Both carbon metabolism and thylakoid reactions have been suggested as the primary site of injury at these temperatures. In the present study this issue was addressed by first characterizing leaf temperature dynamics in Pima cotton (Gossypium barbadense) grown under irrigation in the US desert south-west. It was found that cotton leaves repeatedly reached temperatures above 40 degreesC and could fluctuate as much as 8 or 10 degreesC in a matter of seconds. Laboratory studies revealed a maximum photosynthetic rate at 30-33 degreesC that declined by 22% at 45 degreesC. The majority of the inhibition persisted upon return to 30 degreesC. The mechanism of this limitation was assessed by measuring the response of photosynthesis to CO2 in the laboratory. The first time a cotton leaf (grown at 30 degreesC) was exposed to 45 degreesC, photosynthetic electron transport was stimulated (at high CO2) because of an increased flux through the photorespiratory pathway. However, upon cooling back to 30 degreesC, photosynthetic electron transport was inhibited and fell substantially below the level measured before the heat treatment. In the field, the response of assimilation (A) to various internal levels Of CO2 (C-i) revealed that photosynthesis was limited by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration at normal levels Of CO2 (presumably because of limitations in thylakoid reactions needed to support RuBP regeneration). There was no evidence of a ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) limitation at air levels Of CO2 and at no point on any of 30 A-C-i curves measured on leaves at temperatures from 28 to 39 degreesC was RuBP regeneration capacity measured to be in substantial excess of the capacity of Rubisco to use RuBP. It is therefore concluded that photosynthesis in field-grown Pima cotton leaves is functionally limited by photosynthetic electron transport and RuBP regeneration capacity, not Rubisco activity.","Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, Madison, WI 53706 USA; Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biol & Microbiol, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Wisconsin System","Sharkey, TD (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Bot, 430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.","tsharkey@wisc.edu","Sharkey, Thomas D/B-4032-2009; Wise, Robert/AAC-6190-2021; Sharkey, Thomas/ABF-1317-2020","Sharkey, Thomas D/0000-0002-4423-3223; Sharkey, Thomas/0000-0002-4423-3223","","","",NA,"34","329","365","3","108","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0140-7791","1365-3040","","PLANT CELL ENVIRON","Plant Cell Environ.","JUN","2004","27","6","",NA,"",NA,"717","724","","10.1111/j.1365-3040.2004.01171.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2004.01171.x","","","8","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","827BQ",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000221873700006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We analysed long-term data from Finnish Lapland in order to evaluate the critical assumption of the mast depression hypothesis: that better individual performance of herbivores, followed by high annual growth rate of populations, occurs in the year following mast seeding of the host, the mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii). Since mast seeding has been suggested to occur at the expense of chemical defence against herbivores, we bioassayed the quality of birch leaves from the same trees by means of yearly growth trials with autumnal moth larvae. We also measured the size of wild adults as a determinant of potential fecundity of the species in different years. The relative growth rate of larvae was poorer in post-mast years compared to other years, rather than better as assumed by the hypothesis. Conversely, a slight indication of the increase in potential fecundity was observed due to the somewhat larger adult size in post-mast years. Population growth rate estimates, however, showed that the increase in fecundity would have to be much higher to facilitate population increase towards a cyclic peak with outbreak density. Accordingly, our two data sets do not support the assumption of a higher annual growth rate in autumnal moth populations subsequent to mast seeding of the host, thereby contradicting the predictions of the mast depression hypothesis. Temperatures, when indexed by the North Atlantic Oscillation and accumulated thermal sums, were observed to correlate with the abundance or rate of population change of the autumnal moth. The factors underlying the regular population cycles of the autumnal moth, however, remain unidentified. Overall, we suggest that the causal agents in cyclic insect population dynamics should be clarified by field experimentation, since trophic interactions are complex and are further modified by abiotic factors such as climate.","Turku Univ, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland; Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res, WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; Univ Helsinki, Hyytiala Forestry Field Stn, Korkeakoski 35500, Finland; Turku Univ, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, Aerobiol Unit, Turku 20014, Finland","University of Turku; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Helsinki; University of Turku","Klemola, T (corresponding author), Turku Univ, Sect Ecol, Dept Biol, Turku 20014, Finland.","tero.klemola@utu.fi","Klemola, Tero/B-9235-2014; Kaitaniemi, Pekka/A-2022-2008","Klemola, Tero/0000-0002-8510-329X; Kaitaniemi, Pekka/0000-0002-5162-242X","","","",NA,"64","22","24","2","17","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0029-8549","1432-1939","","OECOLOGIA","Oecologia","MAY","2003","135","3","",NA,"",NA,"354","361","","10.1007/s00442-003-1194-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-003-1194-7","","","8","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","684GX","12721824","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000183198000005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This study examined the influences of diluted seawater on the growth, antioxidation capacity and accumulation of bioactive compounds of the marine macroalga, Sargassum muticum. Compared to the natural seawater (30 ppt, parts per thousand) control, the specific growth rate was clearly elevated at diluted seawater with 15 and 20 ppt during the initial 3 days, and was not statistically different at diluted seawater from 15 to 30 ppt at 15 days, while it decreased significantly at a low seawater concentration of 10 ppt. Chlorophyll a, carotenoids and total protein content fluctuated slightly under the different seawater solutions, suggesting that the algal cells underwent metabolic regulation during the period of adaptation to culture media changes. Changes in seawater concentration altered antioxidant enzyme activity, for instance, total superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase, especially at low seawater solutions with 10 and 15 ppt. The malondialdehyde content also increased substantially, indicating that oxidative damage occurred in diluted seawater below 15 ppt. Moreover, the alginate content increased with decreasing seawater concentration, the alginate productivity was significantly increased by 22.32%-54.79% in all dilutions at 3 days and this promotion continued only at 15 and 20 ppt salinities after 7 days. The fucoxanthin content reduced significantly in the 10 and 15 ppt dilutions at 15 days, however, its productivity increased slightly at 10 and 15 ppt salinities in the first 3 days. The phlorotannin content increased slightly in the seawater dilutions with 20 ppt at 3 and 7 days, meanwhile, its productivity was significantly elevated during the initial 3 days at all seawater dilutions and the highest value was found at 20 ppt treatment.

In ectotherms, higher metabolic rates from warming temperatures can beneficially speed metabolism and development. If compounded by chronic, sublethal pollution, additional resource demands for elimination or detoxification may limit their ability to cope with rising temperaturesthe toxicant-induced climate susceptibility hypothesis. In outdoor bioassays, using natural lake water as the background, the authors investigated the development of a model ectotherm in 6 levels of Cd, Cu, and Pb mixtures and 3 thermal regimes of diel temperature fluctuations: ambient, +1.5 degrees C, and +2.5 degrees C. Warming had no effect on wild-caught Cope's gray tree frog (Hyla chrysoscelis) until metals concentrations were approximately 10-fold of their bioavailable chronic criterion unit (sums of bioavailable fractions of chronic criteria concentrations). In treatments with 10 bioavailable chronic criterion units and +1.5 degrees C, growth increased. Conversely, in treatments with 28 bioavailable chronic criterion units and maximal +2.5 degrees C warming, growth declined and the body condition of postmetamorphic juveniles at 20d was 34% lower than that of juveniles from background conditions (lake water at ambient temperatures). These findings suggest toxicant-induced climate susceptibility with long-term latent effects on the juvenile life stage. Sublethal contaminants can intensify the impact on aquatic ectotherms at the most conservative levels of predicted global warming over the next century. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:1872-1882.

Fluctuating light regimes simulated regular vertical mixing in lakes with a ratio of euphotic to mixed depth (z(eu) : z(mix)) of 1 and 0.5 on a cloudless day. Light fluctuations at z(eu) : z(mix) = 1 decreased the growth rates of S. minutulus, N. acicularis, and L. redekei by 18%, 33%, and 29%, respectively, compared to constant light at the same daily light supply. Temperature had no effect on this decrease. Halving z(eu) : z(mix) (simulating deep mixing) had the same effect on growth as halving the photoperiod, demonstrating that these factors are cumulative. We introduce a simple empirical factor to adjust growth rates measured under constant light to account for fluctuating light. This factor is independent of temperature and photoperiod, applies over a range of z(eu) : z(mix), and accurately describes present and published growth rates of several species.

Using morphological (light and scanning electron microscopy) and SSU rRNA gene data both isolates (ROS D99 and ROS D125) were identified as members of a Fragilaria-Synedropsis clade.

Here, we assessed the effects of observed climate variability on different organismal groups (amphibians, insects, mammals, herbaceous plants and reptiles) by estimating the extent to which interannual variation in the annual population growth rates (CV lambda) and the absolute value of the long-term population growth rate (|log lambda|) were associated with short-term climate variability. We used empirical data (>= 20 consecutive years of annual abundances) from 59 wild populations in the Northern Hemisphere, and quantified variabilities in population growth rates and climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation in active and inactive seasons) calculated over four- and eight-year sliding time windows. We observed a positive relationship between the variability of growth rate (CV lambda) and the variability of temperature in the active season at the shorter timescale only. Moreover, |log lambda| was positively associated with the variability of precipitation in the inactive season at both timescales. Otherwise, the direction of the relationships between population dynamics and climate variability (if any) depended largely on the season and organismal group in question. Both CV lambda and |log lambda| correlated negatively with species' lifespan, indicating general differences in population dynamics between short-lived and long-lived species that were not related to climate variability. Our results suggest that although temporal variation in population growth rates and the magnitude of long-term population growth rates are partially associated with short-term interannual climate variability, demographic responses to climate fluctuations might still be population-specific rather than specific to given organismal groups, and driven by other factors than the observed climate variability.","[Le Coeur, Christie; Ramula, Satu] Univ Turku, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland; [Storkey, Jonathan] Rothamsted Res, Sustainable Agr Sci, Harpenden, Herts, England","University of Turku; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research","Le Coeur, C (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Biol, Turku, Finland.","christielecoeur@gmail.com","","Storkey, Jonathan/0000-0003-1094-8914","Academy of Finland [285746]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) of the UK; BBSRC [BBS/E/00005189]","Academy of Finland(Academy of Finland); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) of the UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","This work was financially supported by the Academy of Finland (grant no. 285746 to SR).

Such fluctuations could be linked with the variability of the Mediterranean climate. We studied experimentally the relationships between those fluctuations of abundance and the water temperature. The establishment and growth pattern of the species were studied in three temperate ranges. Each species has its own germination pattern, which varies with the temperature. The speed of seedling emergence changes with the temperature for all species. The germination rate is modified significantly only for charophytes, with a strong decrease under cold conditions. The size of the diaspore bank explains a large part of the germination dynamics for Chara sp. and Zannichellia spp. At the end of the establishment stage, the cover is maximum under warm conditions and Callitriche truncata and Zannichellia spp. have the largest cover values. At the end of the growth period, Ranunculus boudotii generally dominates the community in terms of biomass, whereas C. truncata is dominated. Species biomass varies with the temperature during the establishment or (and) the growth stage, except for Zannichellia spp. There is no obvious ''preemption'' effect: the contrasted life history strategies among species allow dominance relationship modifications during the life cycle.","CNRS,CTR ECOL FONCT & EVOLUT,F-34003 MONTPELLIER,FRANCE; STN BIOL TOUR VALAT,F-13200 LE SAMBUC,FRANCE; ORSTOM,INST FRANCAIS RECH SCI DEV COOPERAT,F-34032 MONTPELLIER 1,FRANCE","UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD)","","","","","","","",NA,"35","9","9","0","6","NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA","OTTAWA","RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA","0008-4026","","","CAN J BOT","Can.

The coupling of annual light-temperature regimes also drives complementary seasonal cycles of energy supply (primary production) and demand (metabolism), perhaps promoting temporal stability in carbon (C) storage and food web production that may be difficult to discern in most ecosystems. Spring-fed streams in the Arctic are subject to extreme annual fluctuations in light availability but have relatively stable water temperatures, which allows assessment of the independent effects of light and temperature. We used the unusual annual light and temperature regimes of Ivishak Spring, Alaska, USA (latitude 69 degrees N, annual water temperature range 4-7 degrees C) to test predictions about the effect of light availability on consumer productivity with minimally confounding effects of temperature. We predicted that (1) annual patterns of secondary production would follow patterns of primary production, rather than temperature, due to organic C limitation during winter darkness when photosynthesis is effectively halted, (2) C limitation would propagate from primary producers upward through several trophic levels, (3) the lack of temperature dependence during winter darkness would be expressed as anomalous Arrhenius plots of growth rates indicating decoupled production-temperature relationships, and (4) consumer diets would reflect C limitation during winter. As predicted, we found (1) lowest production by macroinvertebrates and Salvelinus malma (Dolly Varden char) at the lowest light levels rather than the lowest temperatures, (2) apparent winter C limitation propagated upward through three trophic levels, (3) anomalous Arrhenius plots indicating lack of temperature dependence of consumer growth rates during winter, and (4) lowest consumption of diatoms (by macroinvertebrates) and invertebrate prey (by S. malma) during winter. Together, these results indicate that light drives annual patterns of animal production in Ivishak Spring, with stable annual temperatures likely exacerbating C limitation of ectotherm metabolism during winter. The timing and severity of winter C limitation in this unusual Arctic-spring food web highlight a fundamental role for light-temperature synchrony in matching energy supply with demand in most other ecosystem types, thereby conferring a measure of stability in the metabolism of their food webs over annual time scales.","[Huryn, Alexander D.; Benstead, Jonathan P.] Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA","University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa","Huryn, AD (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Biol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.","huryn@bama.ua.edu","","","National Science Foundation [OPP-0611995, DEB-1637459]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank Naomi Whitty and Matt Irinaga (CH2M HILL Polar Services) for logistical support, and Ed Serrano, Pele Tierney, Jonas Calvillo, Bryan Minnear, Don Herbert, Ryan Porhola, and Scott Nicholson for helicopter transportation to Ivishak Spring.

However, we know relatively little about how species respond to such climate fluctuations, with respect to variation in vital rates (i.e. survival, growth and reproduction of individuals) and population fluctuations. We examine whether populations display evidence of buffering against environmental variation in one of two ways: (1) through negative covariances among vital rates, or (2) reduction of variation in those vital rates to which population growth is most sensitive. We analyse time series of demographic data for 40 plant species and show that there is no evidence for either of these mechanisms. In species in which there is evidence for vital rate covariation, positive covariances between reproduction and survival rates predominate, and tend to magnify the effect of variability. Increasing climate variability is therefore expected to increase population fluctuations and extinction risks.","[Jongejans, Eelke; de Kroon, Hans] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Expt Plant Ecol, Inst Water & Wetland Res, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Tuljapurkar, Shripad] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Herrin Labs, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Shea, Katriona] Penn State Univ, Dept Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Shea, Katriona] Penn State Univ, IGDP Ecol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Radboud University Nijmegen; Stanford University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","Jongejans, E (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Expt Plant Ecol, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, Netherlands.","E.Jongejans@science.ru.nl","de Kroon, Hans/B-3359-2009; Jongejans, Eelke/B-4832-2008; Shea, Katriona/B-7954-2008","de Kroon, Hans/0000-0001-6151-3561; Jongejans, Eelke/0000-0003-1148-7419; Shea, Katriona/0000-0002-7607-8248; Tuljapurkar, Shripad/0000-0001-5549-4245","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research [863.08.006]; National Science Foundation [DEB-0614065, DEB-0614612]","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We are grateful to Xavier Pico, Patrick Endels, Pieter Zuidema, Selina Heppell, Miguel Franco, Hal Caswell, Hans Jacquemyn, Marco Visser, Johan Ehrlen, Stephen Roxburgh, David Steinsaltz and Raziel Davison for helpful discussions.

Case studies consider two algae species (Phaeodactylum. tricornutum and Isochrysis. galbana) and four locations (Tulsa, USA; Hyderabad, India; Cape Town, South Africa; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). They investigate the influences of the type of algae strain and geographical location on algae biomass production costs. From our case studies, the combination of I. galbana species grown in Hyderabad, India, with a raceway pond geometry of 30 cm channel depth, about a meter channel width, and 300 m in length, and a harvest interval of every six days yielded the minimum algal biomass production costs. The results of the sensitivity analysis reveal that smaller channel depths and longer ponds (within the ranges considered) are recommended to minimize the net present cost of algae biomass production.","[Yadala, Soumya; Cremaschi, Selen] Univ Tulsa, Russell Sch Chem Engn, 800 South Tucker Dr, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA","University of Tulsa","Cremaschi, S (corresponding author), Univ Tulsa, Russell Sch Chem Engn, 800 South Tucker Dr, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA.","soumya-yadala@utulsa.edu; selen-cremaschi@auburn.edu","Cremaschi, Selen/AAG-8455-2020","Cremaschi, Selen/0000-0002-9333-344X","","","",NA,"43","11","13","0","18","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2227-9717","","PROCESSES","Processes","JUN","2016","4","2","",NA,"",NA,"","","10","10.3390/pr4020010","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr4020010","","","31","Engineering, Chemical","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Engineering","DR6VY",NA,"gold, Green Submitted","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000380040600003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The experiment was performed during 1998-2001 in twelve-year-old apricot trees (Prunus armeniaca L., cv. Bulida), growing under field conditions in Murcia, Spain (semi-arid climate, with 1500 mm average annual evaporation and 350 mm rainfall) in a clay loam texture soil (128 mm m(-1) available soil water content and 1.45 Mg m(-3) bulk density). Trees were submitted to two drip irrigated treatments: a control treatment irrigated at 100% of seasonal ETc and a water deficit treatment (WD) irrigated at 50% of the control treatment. The diurnal courses of leaf water potentials, leaf conductance, net photosynthesis, leaf temperature, sap flow and trunk diameter fluctuations were studied throughout one growing season. The deficit treatment showed stomatal regulation as an adaptive mechanisms to drought, which allows plants to regulate water loss more effectively. Leaf temperature values were higher in WD than in the control treatment, and acted as a good stress indicator. Net photosynthesis showed a good correlation with leaf conductance values. In deficit irrigation conditions, osmotic adjustment was not observed. Both leaf water potential and gas exchange parameters were well correlated with evaporative demand of the atmosphere. Trunk diameters oscillate over a 24-h cycle, reaching a maximum value just before sunrise and a minimum sometime in the afternoon. The difference between maximum and minimum values is termed maximum daily shrinkage (MDS). This parameter increased in WD plants during the first period of the growing season, however, when the water stress was accumulated (in the last period of the growing season), MDS shown an important decrease in the water stressed plants respect to the irrigated ones. The sap flow values were lower in the deficit than in the control treatment throughout the growing season, although the greatest differences were observed in spring. Trunk diameter and sap flow showed moderately good correlations with the mean daily ETo in adult apricot trees grown under non-limiting soil water conditions.","CSIC, CEBAS, Dept Riego & Salindad, E-30100 Murcia, Spain","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Edafologia y Biologia Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS)","Ruiz-Sanchez, MC (corresponding author), CSIC, CEBAS, Dept Riego & Salindad, POB 164, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.","mcruiz@cebas.csic.es","Nicolas, Emilio/G-3785-2011; Pastor, Alejandro Pérez/F-6542-2016; DOMINGO, RAFAEL/F-7133-2016; Ruiz-Sánchez, M.

Little is known about requirements for optimal growth and survival of this species, especially about temperature constraints that define natural distribution.

All strains were eurythermal and viable between 4 and 32degreesC, explaining their presence in temperate regions. Some differences in temperature response among the strains were observed, not only for growth rate but also for biovolume and net production. The implication of the observed responses was evaluated by translating growth performance of strains in the laboratory to potential performance in the natural habitats. Only the Japanese strain seemed to be well adapted to its environment, while the New Zealand strain exhibited growth and survival over a much broader temperature range, despite the small temperature fluctuations in its habitat. Interestingly, the German Wadden Sea strain encounters lethal temperatures in winter and must have a resting stage, able to survive temperatures <4degreesC, to explain its occurrence in this region.

However, as a result of high light intensities, the temperature in photobioreactors can reach temperatures up to 50 degrees C. Control of temperature is essential to avoid losses on biomass productivity but should be limited to a minimum to avoid high energy requirements for cooling. Our objective is to develop a production process in which cooling is not required. We studied the behaviour of thermotolerant microalgae Picochlorum sp. (BPE23) under four diel temperature regimes, with peak temperatures from 30 degrees C up to a maximum of 47.5 degrees C. The highest growth rate of 0.17 h-1 was obtained when applying a daytime peak temperature of 40 degrees C. Operating photobioreactors in tropical regions, with a maximal peak temperature of 40 degrees C, up from 30 degrees C, reduces microalgae production costs by 26.2 %, based on simulations with a pre-existing techno-economic model.

Since insects are ectotherms, their colonization and development on carcasses are strongly temperature-dependent and predictable, rendering them a powerful tool for estimating the postmortem interval. Nitidulidae is a large family of common storage and agricultural pests of forensic significance. In this study, the development of the sap beetle Nitidula rufipes (Linnaeus, 1767) was observed under seven constant temperatures between 16 and 34 degrees C to describe the growth and morphology as well as survival rates of the different developmental stages using multiple scientific imaging and statistical techniques. We showed that N. rufipes can complete its development at temperatures between 16 and 34 degrees C, where the longest developmental time is 71.0 +/- 4.4 days at 16 degrees C and the shortest is 20.8 +/- 2.4 days at 34 degrees C. Body length measurements combined with morphological characteristics allowed for larval aging and instar discrimination, thus providing relatively complete developmental data for N. rufipes. This information serves to aid forensic investigators in determining the postmortem interval of carcasses using N. rufipes. Coleoptera, including the family Nitidulidae, are valuable for estimating long-term postmortem intervals in the late stage of body decomposition. This study showed that, under seven constant temperatures of 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 34 degrees C, the developmental durations of Nitidula rufipes (Linnaeus, 1767) from oviposition to eclosion were 71.0 +/- 4.4, 52.9 +/- 4.1, 40.1 +/- 3.4, 30.1 +/- 2.1, 24.2 +/- 2.0, 21.0 +/- 2.3, and 20.8 +/- 2.4 days, respectively. The morphological indexes of body length, the widths of the head capsules, and the distance between the urogomphi of the larvae were measured in vivo. The regression model between larval body length and developmental durations was simulated for larval aging, and the head capsule width and the distance between the urogomphi at different instars were cluster-analyzed for instar discrimination. Based on the developmental durations, larval body length and thermal summation data were obtained, and the isomorphen diagram, isomegalen diagram, linear thermal summation models, and curvilinear Optim SSI models were established. The lower developmental threshold and thermal summation constant of N. rufipes evaluated by the linear thermal summation models were 9.65 +/- 0.62 degrees C and 471.40 +/- 25.46 degree days, respectively. The lower developmental thresholds, intrinsic optimum temperature, and upper lethal developmental threshold obtained by Optim SSI models were 10.12, 24.15, and 36.00 degrees C, respectively. The study of the immature stages of N. rufipes can provide preliminary basic developmental data for the estimation of minimum postmortem interval (PMImin). However, more extensive studies are needed on the effects of constant and fluctuating temperatures on the development of N. rufipes.","[Hu, Gengwang; Li, Liangliang; Guo, Yi; Kang, Chengtao; Wang, Yinghui; Zhang, Yanan; Zhang, Zhixiang; Wang, Jiangfeng; Wang, Yu] Soochow Univ, Dept Forens Med, Ganjiang East Rd, Suzhou 215000, Peoples R China","Soochow University - China","Wang, Y (corresponding author), Soochow Univ, Dept Forens Med, Ganjiang East Rd, Suzhou 215000, Peoples R China.","yuw@suda.edu.cn","","","","","",NA,"125","0","0","2","2","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2075-4450","","INSECTS","Insects","MAR","2023","14","3","",NA,"",NA,"","","299","10.3390/insects14030299","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects14030299","","","23","Entomology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Entomology","A7IB3","36975984","gold, Green Published","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000956806700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Because it is difficult to access, the root system is frequently neglected in growth models, or its metabolism is rated based on generalizations from other organs. Here, whole-plant cuvettes were used for investigating total-plant carbon exchange with the environment over full diurnal cycles. Dynamics of primary metabolism and diurnally resolved phloem exudation profiles, as proxy of assimilate transport, were combined to obtain a full picture of resource allocation. This uncovered a strong impact of periodicity of inter-organ transport on the efficiency of carbon gain. While a sinusoidal fluctuation of the transport rate, with minor diel deflections, minimized respiratory losses in Arabidopsis wild-type plants, triangular or rectangular patterns of transport, found in mutants defective in either starch or sucrose metabolism, increased root respiration at the end or beginning of the day, respectively. Power spectral density and cross-correlation analysis revealed that only the rate of starch synthesis was strictly correlated to the rate of net photosynthesis in wild-type, while in a sucrose-phosphate synthase mutant (spsa1), this applied also to carboxylate synthesis, serving as an alternative carbon pool. In the starchless mutant of plastidial phospho-gluco mutase (pgm), none of these rates, but concentrations of sucrose and glucose in the root, followed the pattern of photosynthesis, indicating direct transduction of shoot sugar levels to the root. The results demonstrate that starch metabolism alone is insufficient to buffer diurnal fluctuations of carbon exchange.","[Brauner, Katrin; Birami, Benjamin; Heyer, Arnd G.] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Biomat & Biomol Syst, Dept Plant Biotechnol, Pfaffenwaldring 57, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany; [Brauner, Horst A.] DHBW Ravensburg, Inst Elect Engn & Informat, Marienpl 2, D-88212 Ravensburg, Germany; [Birami, Benjamin] KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Plant Atmosphere Interact IMK IFU, Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany","University of Stuttgart; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","Heyer, AG (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Biomat & Biomol Syst, Dept Plant Biotechnol, Pfaffenwaldring 57, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.","arnd.heyer@bio.uni-stuttgart.de","Heyer, Arnd G./O-9828-2015","Heyer, Arnd G./0000-0003-2074-3234","Foundation of German Business (Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft)","Foundation of German Business (Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft)","Katrin Brauner was supported by a fellowship granted by the Foundation of German Business (Stiftung der Deutschen Wirtschaft).

A previously unexplored subfamily of coralline algae, the Lithophylloideae, was investigated from the Gulf of Aden (Balhaf, Yemen). Seasonal changes in Mg/Ca, Li/Ca and Ba/Ca composition of Lithophyllum kotschyanum f. affine were investigated by Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). For the first time in coralline algae, the Li/Ca composition was analyzed and showed a highly significant and positive correlation with Mg/Ca and SST. Monthly algal Mg/Ca and Li/Ca variations indicate a positive correlation with sea surface temperature (SST), and sea surface salinity (SSS), although low growth rates decrease the resolution of the algal record. Albeit no or weak positive correlation between monthly algal Ba/Ca and local SST was found, fluctuations in Ba/Ca suggest the seasonal influence of nutrient-rich deep waters introduced by upwelling, and record an increase of sedimentation at the sampling site likely due to an intensified land use in the area. The Mg/Ca age model shows an average algal extension rate of 1.15 mm yr(-1), and reveals multiple intra-annual banding (previously unreported in the genus Lithophyllum) together with carposporangia formation in late February-early March, when temperature begins to increase. The concentration of MgCO3 in the thallus of L. kotschyanum f. affine is 20 mol% (1 SE), confirming that within the genus, the species sampled in warmer regions contain higher mol% MgCO3. The concentrations of LiCO3 and BaCO3 are 8 mu mol% (0.7 SE) and 0.5 mu mol% (0.03 SE), respectively. Despite the limitations from low-growth rate and species-specific vital effect, coralline algae confirm their utility in climate and oceanographic reconstruction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The rate of seed germination affects seedling quality since seeds which tend to germinate more slowly generally result in low-quality seedlings, especially in aubergine seeds. Alternating temperatures play a crucial role in determining the rate of seed germination in many plant species. This study investigated the effect of alternating temperatures on aubergine seed germination, emergence rates, and physiological changes regulating dormancy. Seeds from four open-pollinated aubergine cultivars were incubated for 14 days under the following temperature regimes: 35/20 degrees C-24/24h, 35/20 degrees C-16/8h, 35/20 degrees C-8/16h, 30/20 degrees C-24/24h, 30/20 degrees C-16/8h, 30/20 degrees C-8/16h, or at constant 25 degrees C. The highest mean germination was 92%, with a corresponding highest mean emergence of 88%, which was found with the 35/20 degrees C-16/8h treatment. All alternating temperature treatments displayed faster germination and emergence compared to the control (25 degrees C), as well as high catalase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase antioxidant enzyme activities, and high auxin and salicylic acid levels. In contrast, lipase enzyme activity, abscisic acid and jasmonic acid content decreased. In conclusion, these findings showed that alternating temperatures improved aubergine seed germination rate, and seedling emergence, and also demonstrated positive correlations with enzymatic and hormonal fluctua-tions within the seeds.

Large ranges of PPFD and soil temperature were obtained in a series of field and growth chamber experiments, In the field, the growth of root systems experiencing day-to-day natural fluctuation of PPFD and temperature was followed, and some of the plants under study were shaded, In the growth chamber, plants experienced contrasting and constant PPFDs and root temperatures, The direct effect of apex temperature on individual root elongation rate was surprisingly low in the range 13-25 degrees C, except for the first days after germination. Root elongation rate was essentially related to intercepted PPFD and to distance to the source, both in the field and in the growth chamber. Branch appearance rate substantially varied among days and environmental conditions. It was essentially linked to taproot elongation rate, as the profile of branch density along the taproot was quite stable. The length of the taproot segment carrying newly appeared branches on a given day was equal to taproot elongation on this day, plus a 'buffering term' which transiently increased if taproot elongation rate slowed down. The proportion of branches which stopped elongating a short distance from the taproot ranged from 50-80% and was, therefore, a major architectural variable, although it is not taken into account in current architectural models, A set of equations accounting for the variabilities in elongation rate, branch appearance rate and proportion of branches which stop elongating, as a function of intercepted PPFD and apex temperature is proposed. These equations apply for both field and growth chamber experiments.","INRA,F-34060 MONTPELLIER 1,FRANCE; UNIV NACL MAR DEL PLATA,CATEDRA FISIOL VEGETAL,FAC CIENCIAS AGR,RA-7620 BALCARCE,ARGENTINA","INRAE; National University of Mar del Plata","","","Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012","","","","",NA,"33","26","29","1","7","OXFORD UNIV PRESS UNITED KINGDOM","OXFORD","WALTON ST JOURNALS DEPT, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX2 6DP","0022-0957","","","J EXP BOT","J.

Then we extrapolated this model to climate conditions expected in 2100. We predict that there is less than 20% possibility of hatchling turtles growing during their first year. Reduced annual growth rates during later years may cause earlier termination of growth, smaller standard carapace lengths, and reduced fecundity. These responses are typical of those that stimulate an extinction vortex.

With a changing climate, there is the potential for this insect to become an increasingly severe pest in certain regions due to increased habitat suitability. To examine this possibility, we developed temperature-based phenology model for S. litura, by constructing thermal reaction norms for cohorts of single life stages, at both constant and fluctuating temperatures within the ecologically relevant range (15-38 degrees C) for its development. Life table parameters were estimated stochastically using cohort updating and rate summation approach. The model was implemented in the geographic information system to examine the potential future pest status of S. litura using temperature change projections from SRES A(1)B climate change scenario for the year 2050. The changes were visualized by means of three spatial indices demonstrating the risks for establishment, number of generations per year and pest abundance according to the temperature conditions. The results revealed that the development rate as a function of temperature increased linearly for all the immature stages of S. litura until approximately 34-36 degrees C, after which it became non-linear. The extreme temperature of 38 degrees C was found lethal to larval and pupal stages of S. litura wherein no development to the next stage occurred. Females could lay no eggs at the extreme low (15 degrees C) and high (>35 degrees C) test temperatures, demonstrating the importance of optimum temperature in determining the suitability of climate for the mating and reproduction in S. litura. The risk mapping predicts that due to temperature increase under future climate change, much of the soybean areas in Indian states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, will become suitable for S. litura establishment and increased pest activity, indicating the expansion of the suitable and favourable areas over time. This has serious implication in terms of soybean production since these areas produce approximately 95% of the total soybeans in India. As the present model results are based on temperature only, and the effects of other abiotic and biotic factors determining the pest population dynamics were excluded, it presents only the potential population growth parameters for S. litura. However, if combined with the field observations, the model results could certainly contribute to gaining insight into the field dynamics of S. litura.","[Fand, Babasaheb B.; Sul, Nitin T.; Bal, Santanu K.; Minhas, P.

The wet season form has large eyespots and a pale band while these characters are much less conspicuous or absent in the dry season form. This plasticity is induced in the laboratory by use of a standard series of constant temperatures in the larval stage yielding a continuous norm of reaction. Butterflies in this study were reared from hatchling larvae in seven regimes which differed with respect to thermoperiod or photoperiod. The effect of rearing treatment on the phenotypic plasticity of the adult wing pattern, on life history traits and on larval feeding rhythms was investigated. Photoperiod had little effect except that constant light produced a higher mortality and tended to produce a longer development time. Thermoperiod had a major effect on the life history traits in comparison to a constant temperature regime with the same daily mean: development time was shorter with higher growth rates. The faster development was associated with a substantial shift in the wing pattern towards the wet season form. Larvae feed mostly at night both under constant and thermoperiod (cool nights) conditions. The results are discussed with respect to the necessity of matching field and laboratory environments in studies of norms of reaction or of life history traits where the adaptive significance of the variation is important.

Hence, it is considered unsuitable for agricultural practices. Despite this, microorganisms inhabiting CSD not only survive these but also support plant growth. From 13 different sand samples of CSD of Goa-India, 250 isolates were obtained on 7 distinct media. These isolates were screened for various plant growth-promoting (PGP) attributes in vitro. Five bacterial isolates exhibiting maximum PGP factors were selected for further screening for ACC deaminase production, antifungal activity and hydrolytic enzyme production. These isolates were subjected to the production of Indole acetic acid and exopolysaccharide in submerged cultivation. These 5 isolates were identified as Pantoea sp. K8AcR2AY004, Chitinophaga eiseniae K4NRBAY001, Pantoea dispersa K4NRR2AY011, Bacillus marisflavi K7SpZMAO002 and Bacillus wiedmannii K3AsBAP008 using biochemical and molecular characterization. These strains were studied for their abilities to promote cowpea growth in vitro and using sand-filled pots. Cowpea seeds treated with C. eiseniae K4NRBAY001, P. dispersa K4NRR2AY011 and B. marisflavi K7SpZMAO002 in sand exhibited higher germination rate, vigor index and growth parameters than uninoculated seeds. The present study demonstrates that bacterial strains from CSD have the potential to stimulate cowpea growth and could be exploited as bio-fertilizers in arid sandy soils.","[Shet, Sulochana Ashok; Garg, Sandeep] Goa Univ, Dept Microbiol, Taleigao Plateau 403206, Goa, India","Goa University","Garg, S (corresponding author), Goa Univ, Dept Microbiol, Taleigao Plateau 403206, Goa, India.","sandeep@unigoa.ac.in","","","University Grant Commission (UGC) [F./2014-15/NFO-2014-15OBC-GOA-486/(SA-III/website)]","University Grant Commission (UGC)(University Grants Commission, India)","This work was supported by University Grant Commission (UGC), National Fellowship for Students to pursue a Ph.D. degree [Award Letter Number: F./2014-15/NFO-2014-15OBC-GOA-486/(SA-III/website)].

To mitigate these threats, identifying and halting the introduction of potentially invasive species is crucial. Although progress has been made in elucidating mechanisms underlying invasion success, the role of species behavioral strategies has only received scant attention. Here, we use the invasion of monk parakeets in Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil to study whether behavioral strategies such as nest thermoregulation and the ability to self-medicate against pathogens contribute to the establishment success of invading species. We relate data on monk parakeet reproductive success to ambient temperatures in- and outside nesting chambers and test the bactericidal potential of plants transported to the nest by breeding monk parakeets. Compared to breeding data from other invaded ranges and parts of the species' native range, our results suggest both thermoregulation and the use of bactericidal plants could potentially influence monk parakeet reproductive success. Thermoregulation maintains stable temperatures of incubator chambers compared to large fluctuations (especially hotter extremes) outside the nest. At least one of the plants brought to the nest effectively inhibited growth of pathogenic bacteria. The union of these two factors could increase reproductive rates and may consequently aid the expansion of the species in new non-native environments.","[Viana, Ivan Reus; Zocche, Jairo Jose] Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense, Programa Pos Grad Ciencias Ambientais, Unidade Acad Humanidades Ciencias & Educ, Caixa Postal 3167, BR-88806000 Criciuma, SC, Brazil; [Viana, Ivan Reus; Zocche, Jairo Jose] Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense, Programa Pos Grad Ciencias Ambientais, BR-88806000 Criciuma, SC, Brazil; [Viana, Ivan Reus; Zocche, Jairo Jose] Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense, Lab Ecol Paisagens & Vertebrados, BR-88806000 Criciuma, SC, Brazil; [Strubbe, Diederik] Univ Antwerp, Evolutionary Ecol Grp, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [Strubbe, Diederik] Univ Ghent, Terr Ecol Unit, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense; Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense; Universidade do Extremo Sul Catarinense; University of Antwerp; Ghent University","Viana, IR (corresponding author), Univ Extremo Sul Catarinense, Programa Pos Grad Ciencias Ambientais, Unidade Acad Humanidades Ciencias & Educ, Caixa Postal 3167, BR-88806000 Criciuma, SC, Brazil.","reusviana@gmail.com; diederik.strubbe@gmail.com; jjz@unesc.net","Zocche, Jairo José J/N-7496-2013; Strubbe, Diederik/J-4299-2015","Zocche, Jairo José J/0000-0003-2291-3065; Reus Viana, Ivan/0000-0002-1211-3358; Strubbe, Diederik/0000-0002-2613-4985","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nivel Superior; European Cooperation in Science and Technology COST Action ParrotNet [ES1304]","Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacao do Estado de Santa Catarina(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa e Inovacoo Estado de Santa Catarina (FAPESC)); Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento Pessoal de Nivel Superior(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); European Cooperation in Science and Technology COST Action ParrotNet(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST))","We thank Jayme Augusto Prevedello for comments and providing language help on a previous version of this manuscript.

BL slightly decreased the ABA content of the spikelet at the milk-ripe stage in the F-temp condition, and slightly increased it in the L-temp condition. The rate of ethylene production was measured only in the F-temp condition. It was markedly high at the milk-ripe stage and low at the dough-ripe stage (21 days after heading).

However, the extent to which the capacity to modulate carbon partitioning rapidly through short-term allosteric regulation may contribute to plant performance is unknown. Here we examine the physiological role of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P-2) during photosynthesis, growth and reproduction in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.). In leaves this signal metabolite contributes to coordination of carbon assimilation and partitioning during photosynthesis by allosterically modulating the activity of cytosolic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Three independent T-DNA insertional mutant lines deficient in 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (F2KP), the bifunctional enzyme responsible for both the synthesis and degradation of Fru-2,6-P-2, lack Fru-2,6-P-2. These plants have normal steady-state rates of photosynthesis, but exhibit increased partitioning of photoassimilate into sucrose and have delayed photosynthetic induction kinetics. The F2KP-deficient plants grow normally in constant environments, but show reduced growth and seed yields relative to wildtype plants in fluctuating light and/or temperature. We conclude that Fru-2,6-P-2 is required for optimum regulation of photosynthetic carbon metabolism under variable growth conditions. These analyses suggest that the capacity of Fru-2,6-P-2 to modulate partitioning of photoassimilate is an important determinant of growth and fitness in natural environments. Significance StatementFructose 2,6-bisphosphate is required for optimum regulation of photosynthetic carbon metabolism under variable growth conditions, and the capacity of this signal metabolite to modulate partitioning of photoassimilate is an important determinant of growth and fitness in natural environments.","[McCormick, Alistair J.; Kruger, Nicholas J.] Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, Oxford OX1 3RB, England","University of Oxford","Kruger, NJ (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Plant Sci, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3RB, England.","nick.kruger@plants.ox.ac.uk","McCormick, Alistair/M-5998-2019; McCormick, Alistair/B-1558-2008","McCormick, Alistair/0000-0002-7255-872X; ","National Research Foundation (South Africa)","National Research Foundation (South Africa)(National Research Foundation - South Africa)","We are grateful to Professor Christine Raines and Dr Tracy Lawson (University of Essex, UK) for the loan of the LI-COR LI-6400 infra-red gas analyser used in this study, and Dr Mark Fricker (University of Oxford, UK) for the development of Leaf Lab software.

Life histories observed under experimental conditions can reveal such complex links; however, designing informative experiments for insects is challenging. Furthermore, inferences obtained under controlled conditions often extrapolate poorly to field conditions. Here, we introduce a pseudo-stage-structured population dynamics model to describe insect development as a renewal process with variable rates. The model permits representing realistic life stage durations under constant and variable environmental conditions. Using the model, we demonstrate how random environmental variations result in fluctuating development rates and affect stage duration. We apply the model to infer environmental dependencies from the life history observations of two common disease vectors, the southern (Culex quinquefasciatus) and northern (Culex pipiens) house mosquito. We identify photoperiod, in addition to temperature, as pivotal in regulating larva stage duration, and find that carefully timed life history observations under semi-field conditions accurately predict insect development throughout the year. The approach we describe augments existing methods of life table design and analysis, and contributes to the development of large-scale climate- and environment-driven population dynamics models for important disease vectors.","[Erguler, Kamil; Georgiades, Pantelis; Lelieveld, Jos] Cyprus Inst, Climate & Atmosphere Res Ctr CARE C, 20 Konstantinou Kavafi St, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Mendel, Jacob] Univ Oxford, Dept Med Sci, Oxford, England; [Petric, Dusan Veljko; Kavran, Mihaela] Univ Novi Sad, Lab Med & Vet Entomol, Fac Agr, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Petric, Mina] Avia GIS NV, B-2980 Zoersel, Belgium; [Demirok, Murat Can; Gunay, Filiz; Alten, Bulent] Hacettepe Univ, Div Ecol, Dept Biol, VERG Labs,Fac Sci, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey; [Lelieveld, Jos] Max Planck Inst Chem, D-55128 Mainz, Germany","University of Oxford; University of Novi Sad; Hacettepe University; Max Planck Society","Erguler, K (corresponding author), Cyprus Inst, Climate & Atmosphere Res Ctr CARE C, 20 Konstantinou Kavafi St, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus.","k.erguler@cyi.ac.cy","","Kavran, Mihaela/0000-0001-5210-9727","VectorNet project; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme [856612]; Cyprus Government","VectorNet project; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme; Cyprus Government","We thank Dr Yiannis Proestos for valuable discussions on the climate datasets and Dr Helen Kettle for valuable advice on implementing the development model with the stagePop package.

In most simulation models, it is calculated every day by multiplying the amount of carbohydrate available to leaves by specific leaf area (SLA). However, leaf expansion rate is considerably reduced by mild water deficits which do not affect photosynthesis, and is not affected by a reduction in the PPFD intercepted during rapid leaf expansion. Specific leaf area undergoes a several-fold variability depending on PPFD, soil water status and time of day. It is increased when environmental conditions have a greater depressive effect on expansion rate than on photosynthesis, and is decreased in the opposite case. It is therefore appropriate to model leaf expansion independently of the plant carbon budget. Consistent characteristics can be deduced from a series of experiments, allowing a model of leaf expansion to be proposed. (i) Time courses of relative leaf expansion rate and of epidermal cell division rate are well conserved within a plant and across a large range of environmental conditions, provided that durations and rates are expressed in thermal time. Maximum relative rates are common to all zones of a leaf and to all leaves of a plant, in maize and sunflower. (ii) A water deficit, or a reduction in intercepted PPFD, imposed in the first half of the period of leaf development affects the relative expansion rate in the deficit only, but permanently affects the absolute expansion rate. In contrast, a reduction in PPFD causes no effect on leaf expansion if imposed in the rapid expansion period when the leaf is autotrophic. (iii) Expansion rate is related to evaporative demand and to the concentration of ABA in the xylem sap with relationships that apply under both field and laboratory conditions. (iv) Tissue expansion and epidermal cell division behave as independent processes which determine epidermal cell area at each time.","INRA, Lab Ecophysiol Plantes Stress Environm, F-34060 Montpellier, France","INRAE","Tardieu, F (corresponding author), INRA, Lab Ecophysiol Plantes Stress Environm, 2 Pl Viala, F-34060 Montpellier, France.","","Muller, Bertrand/AAP-3575-2020; Christine, Granier/C-5226-2010; Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012; Granier, Christine/ABF-4997-2021","Muller, Bertrand/0000-0001-6387-9460; Tardieu, Francois/0000-0002-7287-0094","","","",NA,"38","178","181","1","58","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA","0028-646X","","","NEW PHYTOL","New Phytol.","JUL","1999","143","1","",NA,"",NA,"33","44","","10.1046/j.1469-8137.1999.00433.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.1999.00433.x","","","12","Plant Sciences","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","224TY",NA,"Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000081916300004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Temporal fluctuation in selection pressures in variable environments is a leading explanation for maintenance of such genetic diversity. To test the influence of temperature as a selection force in continually (seasonally) changing aquatic systems we carried out reaction norms experiments on co-occurring clonal genotypes of a ubiquitous diatom species, Asterionella formosa Hassall, across an environmentally relevant range of temperatures. We report within population genetic diversity and extensive diversity in genotype-specific reaction norms in growth rates and cell size traits. Our results showed genotype by environment interactions, indicating that no genotype could outgrow all others across all temperature environments. Subsequently, we constructed a model to simulate the relative proportion of each genotype in a hypothetical population based on genotype and temperature-specific population growth rates. This model was run with different seasonal temperature patterns. Our modeling exercise showed a succession of two to several genotypes becoming numerically dominant depending on the underlying temperature pattern. The results suggest that (temperature) context dependent fitness may contribute to the maintenance of genetic diversity in isolated populations of clonally reproducing microorganisms in temporally variable environments.","[Gsell, Alena S.; Domis, Lisette N. de Senerpont; Mooij, Wolf M.; van Donk, Ellen; Ibelings, Bas W.] Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands; [Przytulska-Bartosiewicz, Anna] Univ Laval, Dept Biol, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Przytulska-Bartosiewicz, Anna] Univ Laval, CEN, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Mooij, Wolf M.] Wageningen Univ, Dept Aquat Ecol & Water Qual Management, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Donk, Ellen] Univ Utrecht, Dept Biol, NL-3584 CH Utrecht, Netherlands; [Ibelings, Bas W.] Eawag, Dept Aquat Ecol, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW); Laval University; Laval University; Wageningen University & Research; Utrecht University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science & Technology (EAWAG)","Gsell, AS (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol NIOO KNAW, Dept Aquat Ecol, NL-6708 PB Wageningen, Netherlands.","a.gsell@nioo.knaw.nl","Mooij, Wolf M/C-2677-2008; Ibelings, Bas W/B-4237-2011; van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008; Gsell, Alena S/G-5157-2012; Domis, Lisette N. de Senerpont/C-2902-2008; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/A-4320-2012","Mooij, Wolf M/0000-0001-5586-8200; Ibelings, Bas W/0000-0002-7213-7407; van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936; Gsell, Alena S/0000-0001-7795-1996; Domis, Lisette N. de Senerpont/0000-0001-7509-9541; KNAW, NIOO-KNAW/0000-0002-3835-159X","NWO-ALW [816.01.018, 817.01.007]","NWO-ALW(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO))","We thank Roos Keijzer and Michaela Brehm for help with the DNA extraction and protocol, Suzanne Naus-Wiezer for her aid in culture maintenance, Arnout the Bruin for advice on AFLP analysis and Hennie Uittenhout and Nico Helmsing for installing the water bath setup.

This work aims to delineate the role of plants and to develop an appropriate mathematical model simulating the behavior of such systems. Two parallel pilot-scale systems were built with features of free superficial flow. The first consisted of a basin without plants and the second, identical otherwise, a basin with plants (Typha Latifolia). Each had a surface of 1.10m(2). The loading was municipal wastewater at retention times longer than 25 d. The variation volume of the fluid in each basin was monitored and rainfall and evaporation rates were calculated. The difference of the fluid volume between the basins due to the absorption of the fluid by plants was compared to the evapotranspiration (via the REF ET computer software). The experimental data of plant harvesting were used to assess the nitrogen take-up rates by the plants. A simulation model was developed for each basin, describing the basic physicochemical and biochemical processes using the AQUASIM computer software. The key microbial processes accounted for in the modeling included aerobic heterotrophic growth, ammonification, nitrification and algal growth. A parameter sensitivity analysis was carried out and the most important parameters were identified. Temperature fluctuations were accounted for through proper expressions. A strong seasonal dependence of each system behavior was observed. The simulation model may be used for the design of full-scale artificial free superficial flow wetlands.","[Galanopoulos, C.] Univ Patras, Dept Chem Engn, Rion 26504, Greece; [Leotsinidis, M.] Univ Patras, Dept Med, Hyg Lab, Rion 26504, Greece; [Lyberatos, G.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Chem Engn, Athens 15780, Greece","University of Patras; University of Patras; National Technical University of Athens","Galanopoulos, C (corresponding author), Univ Patras, Dept Chem Engn, Rion 26504, Greece.","lyberatos@chemeng.ntua.gr","","","","","",NA,"23","0","0","0","3","GLOBAL NEST, SECRETARIAT","ATHENS","UNIV, AEGEAN, 30, VOULGAROKTONOU STR, ATHENS, GR 114 72, GREECE","1106-5516","","978-960-7475-51-0","PROC INT CONF ENV SC","","","2013",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"","","","","","","","8","Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","BB7WL",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000346067900326","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In the first experiment, adult females were incubated in glass bottles that were pre-filled with screened seawater containing a natural assemblage of phytoplankton. In the second experiment, the species were incubated in glass bottles that were enriched with different concentrations of Chaetoceros muelleri along with natural assemblages of phytoplankton. Both the experimental setups were then exposed to different temperatures (21, 24, 27, 30 and 33 degrees C). The daily EPR varied significantly across different temperatures and the various food concentrations (p < 0.05). Within the natural food assemblage (Exp. 1), the EPR increased gradually to a peak mean of 13.7 eggs female(-1) d(-1) at 27 degrees C, then declined as temperatures increased (at 30 and 33 degrees C). In the second experiment when the water was enriched with algal culture, EPRs were significantly greater (maximum EPR: 63.9 eggs female(-1) d(-1) at 27 degrees C) than those incubated in ambient water with natural food (maximum EPR: 17.4 eggs female(-1) d(-1) at 21 degrees C). The hatching rate fluctuated between 42.4% and 88.6%.

However, scant evidence suggests that grasstrees may represent an unusual exception. We used weather data and plant water potential to investigate the relationship between leaf growth and season in the grasstree, Xanthorrhoea preissii Endl. (Xanthorrhoeaceae). Leaf production in two contrasting habitats revealed continuous annual growth, oscillating between maximum rates (2.5-3.2 leaves/d) in late-spring to autumn, to a minimum rate of 0.5 leaf/d during winter but never stopping. While the rate of leaf production during the fast-growth season was positively correlated with temperature above 17-18 degrees C, leaf elongation commenced substantially earlier in the year (from 12 degrees C). Leaf water potentials cycled annually, with predawn readings commonly measured as zero during winter-spring and as low as -1.26 MPa during summer, but never indicating stress by exceeding the turgor loss point. Leaf death was synchronized with summer drought. The fast (summer) growth period was characterized by rapidly fluctuating leaf production, particularly in banksia woodland, where plant growth reliably responded quickly to > 18 mm of rainfall. Within 24 h of 59 mm of simulated rainfall, grasstrees in banksia woodland showed a marked increase in water potential, and leaf production reached 7.5 times the controls, confirming their capacity to respond to temporary spasmodic summer rains. Rainfall was the best climatic variable for predicting woodland grasstree leaf production during summer, whereas leaf production of forest grasstrees was most closely correlated with daylength. This plastic response of grasstrees between seasonal weather extremes is relatively rare among other mediterranean floras, and has implications for a recently proposed technique for ageing grasstrees.","Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Environm Biol, Perth, WA 6001, Australia; Univ Notre Dame Australia, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Fremantle, WA 6959, Australia","Curtin University; University of Notre Dame Australia","Korczynskyj, D (corresponding author), Curtin Univ Technol, Dept Environm Biol, Perth, WA 6001, Australia.","dkorczynskyj@nd.edu.au","","Lamont, Byron/0000-0001-9279-7149","","","",NA,"52","0","1","0","6","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1442-9985","1442-9993","","AUSTRAL ECOL","Austral Ecol.","NOV","2005","30","7","",NA,"",NA,"765","774","","10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01517.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01517.x","","","10","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","971OK",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000232393600006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Sodalis glossinidius, which is a facultative symbiont that resides intra and extracellularly within multiple tsetse tissues, has been implicated as a mediator of trypanosome infection establishment in the fly's gut. Tsetse's gut-associated population of Sodalis are subjected to marked temperature fluctuations each time their ectothermic fly host imbibes vertebrate blood. The molecular mechanisms that Sodalis employs to deal with this heat stress are unknown. In this study, we examined the thermal tolerance and heat shock response of Sodalis. When grown on BHI agar plates, the bacterium exhibited the most prolific growth at 25(o)C, and did not grow at temperatures above 30(o)C. Growth on BHI agar plates at 31 degrees C was dependent on either the addition of blood to the agar or reduction in oxygen levels. Sodalis was viable in liquid cultures for 24 hours at 30(o)C, but began to die upon further exposure. The rate of death increased with increased temperature. Similarly, Sodalis was able to survive for 48 hours within tsetse flies housed at 30(o)C, while a higher temperature (37(o)C) was lethal. Sodalis' genome contains homologues of the heat shock chaperone protein-encoding genes dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE, and their expression was up-regulated in thermally stressed Sodalis, both in vitro and in vivo within tsetse fly midguts. Arrested growth of E. coli dnaK, dnaJ, or grpE mutants under thermal stress was reversed when the cells were transformed with a low copy plasmid that encoded the Sodalis homologues of these genes. The information contained in this study provides insight into how arthropod vector enteric commensals, many of which mediate their host's ability to transmit pathogens, mitigate heat shock associated with the ingestion of a blood meal. Author summary Microorganisms associated with insects must cope with fluctuating temperatures. Because symbiotic bacteria influence the biology of their host, how they respond to temperature changes will have an impact on the host and other microorganisms in the host. The tsetse fly and its symbionts represent an important model system for studying thermal tolerance because the fly feeds exclusively on vertebrate blood and is thus exposed to dramatic temperature shifts. Tsetse flies house a microbial community that can consist of symbiotic and environmentally acquired bacteria, viruses, and parasitic African trypanosomes. This work, which makes use of tsetse's commensal endosymbiont, Sodalis glossinidius, is significance because it represents the only examination of thermal tolerance mechanisms in a bacterium that resides indigenously within an arthropod disease vector. A better understanding of the biology of thermal tolerance in Sodalis provides insight into thermal stress survival in other insect symbionts and may yield information to help control vector-borne disease.","[Roma, Jose Santinni; D'Souza, Shaina; Somers, Patrick J.; Cabo, Leah F.; Farsin, Ruhan; Runyen-Janecky, Laura J.] Univ Richmond, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Aksoy, Serap; Weiss, Brian L.] Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Microbial Dis, New Haven, CT 06510 USA","University of Richmond; Yale University","Runyen-Janecky, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Richmond, Dept Biol, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.;Weiss, BL (corresponding author), Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Microbial Dis, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.","lrunyenj@richmond.edu; brian.weiss@yale.edu","","Runyen-Janecky, Laura/0000-0001-7349-0918; Weiss, Brian/0000-0003-1576-3556; Cabo, Leah/0000-0003-4328-9900; D'Souza, Shaina/0000-0002-6482-1583","NIH [AI094343, AI124105]","NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA)","This study was supported by NIH awards AI094343 and AI124105 to LRJ.

Studies on potato late blight (Phytophthora infestans) development have not considered daily temperature oscillations. We hypothesize that growth and development rates of P. infestans would be less influenced by change in average temperature as the magnitude of fluctuations in daily temperatures increases. We investigated the effects of seven constant (10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 23, and 27 degrees C) and diurnally oscillating (+/- 5 and +/- 10 degrees C) temperatures around the same means on number of lesions, incubation period, latent period, radial lesion growth rate, and sporulation intensity on detached potato leaves inoculated with two P. infestans isolates from clonal lineages US-8 and US-23. A four-parameter thermodynamic model was used to describe relationships between temperature and disease development measurements. Incubation and latency progression accelerated with increasing oscillations at low mean temperatures but slowed down with increasing oscillations at high mean temperatures (P < 0.005), as hypothesized. Infection efficiency, lesion growth rate, and sporulation increased under small temperature oscillations compared with constant temperatures but decreased when temperature oscillations were large. Thus, diurnal amplitude in temperature should be considered in models of potato late blight, particularly when predicting effects of global climate change on disease development.","[Shakya, S.

Even though significant recovery has been observed in a few localities, recurrent disease outbreaks, bleaching, storm damage, local environmental deterioration, algae smothering, predation, low sexual recruitment and low survivorship have affected the expected, quick recovery of these weedy species. In this study, the status of three recovering populations of A. cervicornis and two of A. prolifera were assessed over one year using coral growth and mortality metrics, and changes in their associated algae and fish/invertebrate communities in three localities in the La Parguera Natural Reserve (LPNR), southwest coast of Puerto Rico. Five branches were tagged in each of 29, medium size (1-2 m in diameter) A. cervicornis and 18 A. prolifera colonies in the Media Luna, Mario and San Cristobal reefs off LPNR. Branches were measured monthly, together with observations to evaluate associated disease(s), algae accumulation and predation. A. cervicornis grew faster [3.1 +/- 0.44 cm/month (= 37.2 cm/y)] compared to A. prolifera [2.6 +/- 0.41 cm/month (= 31.2 cm/y)], and growth was significantly higher during Winter-Spring compared to Summer-Fall for both taxa (3.5 +/- 0.58 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.15 cm/month in A. cervicornis, and 2.43 +/- 0.71 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.20 cm/month in A. prolifera, respectively). Algal accumulation was only observed in A. cervicornis, and was higher during Spring-Summer compared to Fall-Winter (6.1 +/- 0.91 cm/month and 3.8 +/- 0.29 cm/month, respectively, (PERMANOVA, df = 2, MS = 10.2, p = 0.37)). Mortality associated with white band disease, algae smothering and fish/invertebrate predation was also higher in A. cervicornis and varied among colonies within sites, across sites and across season. The balance between tissue grow and mortality determines if colonies survive. This balance seems to be pushed to the high mortality side often by increasing frequency of high thermal anomalies, inducing bleaching and disease outbreaks and other factors, which have historically impacted the natural recovery of these taxa in the La Parguera Natural Reserve in Puerto Rico and possibly other areas in the region. Overall, results indicate variability in both growth and mortality rates in both taxa across localities and seasons, with A. cervicornis showing overall higher mortalities compared to A. prolifera.","[Weil, Ernesto; Becicka, Rebecca L.; Cruz-Motta, Juan Jose] Univ Puerto Rico, Marine Sci, Mayaguez, PR 00682 USA; [Hammerman, Nicholas M.] Univ Queensland, Gehrmann Labs, St Lucia, Qld, Australia","University of Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez; University of Queensland","Weil, E (corresponding author), Univ Puerto Rico, Marine Sci, Mayaguez, PR 00682 USA.;Hammerman, NM (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Gehrmann Labs, St Lucia, Qld, Australia.","ernesto.weil@upr.edu; n.hammerman@uqconnect.edu.au","Weil, Ernesto/AAI-3591-2020; Weil, Ernesto/ABF-1290-2020","Weil, Ernesto/0000-0001-5275-1584; Cruz Motta, Juan Jose/0000-0001-6117-9014","Department of Marine Sciences, University of Puerto Rico","Department of Marine Sciences, University of Puerto Rico","This project was funded by the Department of Marine Sciences, University of Puerto Rico.

Migration to deeper water layers during the day to escape visually hunting predators is most likely to require physiological adaptations to periodically changing temperatures. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) play crucial roles in membrane temperature acclimation. Exposure to cold temperatures typically results in an increase in the relative abundance of PUFA in cell membranes and PUFA requirements of Daphnia increase with decreasing temperatures. To assess the role of dietary PUFA in coping with temperature fluctuations experienced during DVM, we reared Daphnia magna at either constantly warm or fluctuating temperatures, simulating DVM both with and without dietary PUFA supplementation. We show that the well-known positive effect of dietary eicosapentaenoic acid supplementation on offspring production and population growth rates of D. magna is more pronounced at alternating temperatures than at constantly warm temperatures. Exposure to alternating temperatures caused modification in body PUFA concentrations and, consequently, increased lipid peroxidation. However, detrimental effects of lipid peroxidation were not evident. Our data demonstrate that the capacity to cope with the distinct temperature fluctuations experienced during DVM increases with dietary eicosapentaenoic acid supplementation, suggesting that an adequate dietary PUFA supply is crucial especially for migrating Daphnia populations. A dietary deficiency in long-chain PUFA may thus severely constrain predator evasion, potentially resulting in increased mortality and cascading effects on lower trophic levels.","[Navarro, Jana Isanta; Fromherz, Matthias; Dietz, Michelle; Schwarzenberger, Anke; Martin-Creuzburg, Dominik] Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, Constance, Germany; [Zeis, Bettina] Univ Munster, Inst Zoophysiol, Munster, Germany","University of Konstanz; University of Munster","Navarro, JI (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Limnol Inst, Constance, Germany.","jana.isanta-navarro@uni-konstanz.de","Isanta-Navarro, Jana/HFC-5006-2022; Martin-Creuzburg, Dominik/C-6361-2011","Martin-Creuzburg, Dominik/0000-0002-4248-0730; Isanta-Navarro, Jana/0000-0002-6168-4499","University of Konstanz; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [298726046/GRK2272]","University of Konstanz; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work was funded by the University of Konstanz and by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) -298726046/GRK2272.",NA,"38","9","9","4","16","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0046-5070","1365-2427","","FRESHWATER BIOL","Freshw.

We examined the time courses of CO(2)gas exchanges and chlorophyll fluorescence of seedling leaves in four tropical tree species in response to lightflecks under three different temperature conditions. The three conditions were two constant temperatures at 30 degrees C (T-30) and 40 degrees C (T-40), and a simulated gradually changing temperature from 30 to 40 degrees C (T-dyn). The time required to reach 50% of the full photosynthetic induction underT(40)was similar to, or even larger than, that underT(30). However, the induction of assimilation rate (A) and electron transport rate of photosystem II (ETR II) and Rubisco activation process were generally accelerated underT(dyn)compared to those at eitherT(30)orT(40). The acceleration in photosynthetic induction underT(dyn)was significantly greater in the shade-tolerant species than in the shade-intolerant species. A modified photosynthetic limitation analysis indicated that the acceleration was likely to be mainly due to ETR II at the early stage of photosynthetic induction. The study suggests that concurrent increases in leaf temperature with light may increase leaf carbon gain under highly fluctuating light in tropical tree seedlings, particularly in shade-tolerant species.","[Kang, Hui-Xing; Tang, Yan-Hong] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Inst Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kang, Hui-Xing; Tang, Yan-Hong] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xin-Guang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Mol Plant Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xin-Guang] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Plant Mol Genet, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yamori, Wataru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Inst Sustainable Agroecosyst Serv, Tokyo, Japan","Peking University; Peking University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Tokyo","Tang, YH (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Inst Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Tang, YH (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing, Peoples R China.","tangyh@pku.edu.cn","Yamori, Wataru/C-5680-2011","Yamori, Wataru/0000-0001-7215-4736","Key Research of Plant Functional Ecology Program of Peking University [7101302307]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP16H06552, JP18H02185, JP18KK0170]","Key Research of Plant Functional Ecology Program of Peking University; JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was funded by the Key Research of Plant Functional Ecology Program of Peking University (no. 7101302307).

The objective of this study is to determine whether there are different effects of T-D and T-N on development from sowing to flowering in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Plants of 24 cultivars were grown in naturally-lighted growth chambers at five diurnally constant (22, 24, 26, 28 and 32 degrees C) and four diurnally fluctuating temperatures (26/22, 30/22, 22/26 and 22/30 degrees C for T-D/T-N with 12 h d(-1) each) with a constant photoperiod of 12 h d(-1). The treatments were selected to enable the separation of effects of T-D and T-N on development rate (DR). The response of DR to constant temperatures was typically nonlinear. This nonlinearity could not explain the difference in flowering dates between fluctuating temperatures with the same mean daily value but opposite T-D/T-N differences. Differential effects of T-D and T-N on DR to flowering were detected in all but one cultivar. In most cases, T-D exerted a greater influence than T-N, in contrast with many previous reports based on the assumption of a linearity between DR and temperature. The data were further analysed by a nonlinear model which separated effects of T-D and T-N. The estimated value for the T-N was generally 25-29 degrees C, about 2-4 degrees C lower than the estimated optimum T-D in most cultivars. The effects of T-D and T-N on DR were found to be interactive in some cultivars. These results form a new basis for modelling flowering dates in rice.

Even a 1.0 degrees C increase in seawater temperature from local long-term summer maxima lasting for weeks to months results in bleaching and/or mortality in reef-building corals. Studies on coral resistance mechanisms have proposed a correlation between shuffling of different Symbiodiniaceae genera (changing the dominant Symbiodiniaceae genera) and putative thermal tolerance in corals. Although it was suggested that some corals can increase their tolerance by 1.0-1.5 degrees C through shuffling to thermally tolerant Durusdinium trenchii (formerly D1a), the effects of accumulated thermal stress due to prolonged high temperatures on the survival of corals that have shuffled have not been investigated. We show herein that prolonged exposure to high temperature (> 10.43-degree heating weeks) can drastically reduce coral survival rate even after it has shuffled to stress-tolerant Symbiodiniaceae genera. Our study suggests that there is a limit to the capacity of for shuffling, and hence is likely to lose its efficacy in the future as repeated and prolonged thermal stress events become more frequent and pronounced.","[Kao, Kuo-Wei; Keshavmurthy, Shashank; Tsao, Cing-Hsin; Chen, Chaolun Allen] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Kao, Kuo-Wei; Tsao, Cing-Hsin; Chen, Chaolun Allen] Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Wang, Jih-Terng] Tajen Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Biotechnol, Pingtung 90741, Taiwan; [Chen, Chaolun Allen] Acad Sinica, Taiwan Int Grad Program TIGP Biodivers, Taipei 11529, Taiwan","Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan","Keshavmurthy, S; Chen, CA (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.;Chen, CA (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Inst Oceanog, Taipei 106, Taiwan.;Chen, CA (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Taiwan Int Grad Program TIGP Biodivers, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.","weberkao@gmail.com; coralresearchtaiwan@gmail.com; stevetaso123@gmail.com; jtwtaiwan@gmail.com; cac@gate.sinica.edu.tw","","","Academia Sinica; Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC101-2621-B-001-005-MY3]; Academia Sinica Thematic Grants [AS-104-SS-A03]","Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan); Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning, Republic of Korea); Academia Sinica Thematic Grants","The authors wish to thank members of the Coral Lab, Biodiversity Research Center, Academia Sinica (BRCAS; Taipei, Taiwan), for assistance with sampling and field logistics.

These systems include soil-plant-atmosphere research (SPAR) chambers, free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) facilities, temperature-gradient greenhouses (TGG), and open top chambers (OTC). The SPAR chambers have several advantages compared to FACE and other facilities, including: (a) constant CO2 concentration and stabile setpoints; (b) CO2 concentration controlled to any range of sub-ambient through supra-ambient levels, providing comparison of plant responses to past and future climates; (c) precise air and dewpoint temperature setpoints; (d) calculation of whole-canopy photosynthesis and evapotranspiration rates at short time intervals; (e) calculation of whole-canopy respiration rates during the night; (f) determination of plant responses to temperature alone or including other factors; (g) multiple chambers for simultaneous comparison of plant responses to varying environments, providing data for plant growth modeling; (h) low operating expense for CO2 concentration; and (i) capability of measuring N-2 fixation rates in the rooting zone of legumes or methane emissions from rice (Oryza sativa L.). SPAR systems were better suited than FACE systems for more than half of the attributes of enrichment systems identified in this paper. Limitations of plant responses due to fluctuating elevated CO2 concentration and limitations of range of elevated CO2 concentration exist for FACE systems. Controlled environments are needed for developing mathematical growth response functions under a wide range of conditions. Finally, we identified a use of portable SPAR chambers within FACE experiments for confirmation of diminished plant photosynthesis in fluctuating CO2 concentration.","[Allen, L. H.; Vu, J. C.

Rice has the striking feature that the rate of the phytomer production is closely synchronized with the rate of leaf emergence (phyllochron). We examined developmental changes of phyllochron by using 10 near-isogenic lines (NILs) showing diversified growth durations in rice. The NILs were established by backcrosses with a strain practically insensitive to photoperiod, and they consisted of early- or late- flowering NILs whose differences of growth duration were caused by the combinations of alleles at 6 loci. The developmental patterns of phyllochron were evaluated by means of a quartic polynomial, which fitted well in most cases. The results indicated that phyllochron greatly changed during development, especially in late-flowering NILs as well as the recurrent parents, although the fluctuation of phyllochron was not so marked in the early-flowering NILs. Thus, the developmental change of phyllochron was highly dependent upon the genotypes and/or growth duration; however, it was associated with neither floral initiation nor temperature, indicating that the change of phyllochron might reflect internal or physiological changes which occur during the life cycle of rice.","Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Plant Breeding Lab, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; Univ Ryukyus, Fac Agr, Plant Breeding Lab, Okinawa 9030129, Japan","Hokkaido University; University of the Ryukyus","Itoh, Y (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Plant Breeding Lab, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.","","","","","","",NA,"30","12","13","0","7","KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL","DORDRECHT","SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0014-2336","","","EUPHYTICA","Euphytica","","2001","119","3","",NA,"",NA,"271","278","","10.1023/A:1017577218630","http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017577218630","","","8","Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Horticulture","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture; Plant Sciences","443FE",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000169329500004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

C. nodosa, Z. noltii, and Z. marina showed comparable growth patterns as indicated by significant correlations of growth across species (cross correlation, r > 0.54, p < 0.05). This result provided evidence of a similarity in the response of these species to seasonal forcing. The seasonal pattern of P. oceanica resembled that of the other species in shoot weight, shoot elongation, and ramet recruitment, whereas it differed in internode weight and rhizome elongation. Despite some similarities in seasonal growth patterns, the patterns were lagged by 1 to 2 mo across species, and the magnitude of seasonal growth fluctuations was species-dependent, Species-specific responses of seagrasses to climate forcing should be related to differences in the capacity of the plants to store resources and to the extent of ramet integration among species, both processes being closely related to plant size. Large seagrasses (e.g. P. oceanica), with thick and long-living rhizomes, should be able to store more photoassimilates and to transport them over longer distances than small plants (e.g. C. nodosa), with thinner and shorter-living rhizomes. Large species should, therefore, be able to grow more independently of environmental conditions than small ones. Moreover, C. nodosa showed the greatest response to temperature fluctuations whereas Z. marina growth was strongly coupled to seasonal light conditions, indicating different plant sensitivity to climate fluctuations among species. This study confirms the great variability in seagrass seasonality possible under similar seasonal forcing, and demonstrates that seagrass seasonality has both an extrinsic component, dependent on seasonal forcing of light and temperature, and an intrinsic component. The intrinsic component of seagrass seasonality likely involves a differential capacity of the species to regulate the internal resource economy which may buffer, or amplify, the external seasonal forcing.","CSIC, CTR ESTUDIOS AVANCATS BLANES, E-17300 BLANES, GIRONA, SPAIN","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes (CEAB)","","","Marbà, Nuria/N-8143-2019; Marba, Nuria/H-8136-2015; Duarte, Carlos M/A-7670-2013; Duarte Quesada, Carlos Manuel/ABD-6208-2021","Marbà, Nuria/0000-0002-8048-6789; Marba, Nuria/0000-0002-8048-6789; Duarte, Carlos M/0000-0002-1213-1361; Enriquez, Susana/0000-0001-5776-902X","","","",NA,"73","144","148","1","38","INTER-RESEARCH","OLDENDORF LUHE","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","0171-8630","1616-1599","","MAR ECOL PROG SER","Mar.

Here, we evaluate the effects of thermal mean and variability on R-0, r and Tg, at four population densities in Drosophila melanogaster. The results show that R-0, r and Tg present differential responses to thermal variation. Although temperature effects on R-0 and Tg are non-linear, r response was negligible. R-0 and Tg comprise a generational time scale, while r is at a chronological time scale.

In the temperature integration approach, considerable daily temperature variations are allowed, which not only have an important influence on plant growth but also on the development rate of arthropods in the crop. Therefore, we examined the influence of two constant temperature regimes (15 A degrees C/15 A degrees C and 20 A degrees C/20 A degrees C) and one alternating temperature regime (20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C, with an average of 15 A degrees C) on life table parameters of Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus and their target pest, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae at a 16:8 (L:D) h photoperiod and 65 +/- A 5 % RH. For females of both predatory mites the alternating temperature regime resulted in a 25-30 % shorter developmental time as compared to the corresponding mean constant temperature regime of 15 A degrees C/15 A degrees C. The immature development of female spider mites was prolonged for 7 days at 15 A degrees C/15 A degrees C as compared to 20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C. With a daytime temperature of 20 A degrees C, no differences in lifetime fecundity were observed between a nighttime temperature of 20 and 5 A degrees C for P. persimilis and T. urticae. The two latter species did show a higher lifetime fecundity at 20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C than at 15 A degrees C/15 A degrees C, and their daily fecundity at the alternating regime was about 30 % higher than at the corresponding mean constant temperature. P. persimilis and T. urticae showed no differences in sex ratio between the three temperature regimes, whereas the proportion of N. californicus females at 15 A degrees C/15 A degrees C (54.2 %) was significantly lower than that at 20 A degrees C/5 A degrees C (69.4 %) and 20 A degrees C/20 A degrees C (67.2 %). Intrinsic rates of increase were higher at the alternating temperature than at the corresponding mean constant temperature for both pest and predators. Our results indicate that thermal responses of the studied phytoseiid predators to alternating temperature regimes used in energy saving strategies in glasshouse crops may have consequences for their efficacy in biological control programs.","[Vangansbeke, Dominiek; De Schrijver, Lien; Spranghers, Thomas; Duc Tung Nguyen; Tirry, Luc; De Clercq, Patrick] Univ Ghent, Lab Agrozool, Dept Crop Protect, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Audenaert, Joachim; Verhoeven, Ruth; Gobin, Bruno] PCS Ornamental Plant Res, B-9070 Destelbergen, Belgium; [Duc Tung Nguyen] Hanoi Univ Agr, Hanoi, Vietnam","Ghent University; Vietnam National University of Agriculture (VNUA)","De Clercq, P (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Lab Agrozool, Dept Crop Protect, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","Patrick.Declercq@Ugent.be","De Clercq, Patrick/B-5721-2015; Nguyen, Duc Tung/P-1316-2017; Spranghers, Thomas/AAP-1503-2020","De Clercq, Patrick/0000-0003-0664-1602; Nguyen, Duc Tung/0000-0002-8954-3604; Spranghers, Thomas/0000-0002-6789-3531","Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen) [090931]","Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen)(Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT))","This research was supported by project number 090931 from the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen).",NA,"64","26","27","0","81","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0168-8162","1572-9702","","EXP APPL ACAROL","Exp.

In a single plant the photoautotrophic shoot is exposed to pronounced environmental variations recurring in a day-night 24 h (diel) cycle, whereas the heterotrophic root grows in a temporally less fluctuating environment. The contrasting habitats of shoots and roots are reflected in different diel growth patterns and their responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Differences between diel leaf growth patterns of mono- and dicotyledonous plants correspond to their different organization and placement of growth zones. In monocots, heterotrophic growth zones are organized linearly and protected from the environment by sheaths of older leaves. In contrast, photosynthetically active growth zones of dicot leaves are exposed directly to the environment and show characteristic, species-specific diel growth patterns. It is hypothesized that the different exposure to environmental constraints and simultaneously the sink/source status of the growing organs may have induced distinct endogenous control of diel growth patterns in roots and leaves of monocot and dicot plants. Confronted by strong temporal fluctuations in environment, the circadian clock may facilitate robust intrinsic control of leaf growth in dicot plants.","[Ruts, Tom; Matsubara, Shizue; Wiese-Klinkenberg, Anika; Walter, Achim] Forschungszentrum Julich, IBG Plant Sci 2, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Walter, Achim] ETH, Inst Agr Wissensch, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland","Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich","Walter, A (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, IBG Plant Sci 2, Wilhelm Johnen Str, D-52425 Julich, Germany.","walterac@ethz.ch","Matsubara, Shizue/A-5673-2011; Wiese-Klinkenberg, Anika/C-8196-2009; Walter, Achim/N-8392-2013","Matsubara, Shizue/0000-0002-1440-6496; Wiese-Klinkenberg, Anika/0000-0001-9188-809X; Walter, Achim/0000-0001-7753-9643","","","",NA,"142","47","47","2","62","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0022-0957","1460-2431","","J EXP BOT","J.

The duration of the immature period of the offspring of heat-shocked adults was not significantly shorter than that of the control, whereas the duration of the immature period of the offspring of the heat-shocked 2nd instars was longer than that of the other treatments, indicating that heat-shock of second instars slowed the development of their offspring. The preoviposition period during the adult stage and the total oviposition period of the F1 offspring of the heat-shocked adults were significantly longer than those of the control. The fecundities of the F1 offspring of the heat-shocked 2nd instars and adults were 81.8 and 70.6 eggs/female, respectively, both of which were significantly less than that of the control (149.1). The use of heated tents might be effective for the prevention and control of WFT infestations in greenhouses. Our life-table analysis of the effects of heat shock on F1 survival and reproduction provides a strong basis for future studies of thermal treatments for the control of WFT.","[Jiang, Shan; Wang, Sifang; Wang, Junping; Li, Jie; Zhang, Bin; Zheng, Changying] Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Plant Protect, Insect Ecol Lab, Qingdao 266109, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Naiqin] Dezhou Univ, Dept Agron, Dezhou 253023, Shandong, Peoples R China","Qingdao Agricultural University; Dezhou University","Zheng, CY (corresponding author), Qingdao Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Plant Protect, Insect Ecol Lab, Qingdao 266109, Shandong, Peoples R China.","zhengcy67@qau.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31372003]; Taishan Scholarship Construction Engineering Special Fund","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Taishan Scholarship Construction Engineering Special Fund","This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (31372003) and Taishan Scholarship Construction Engineering Special Fund.",NA,"46","6","10","3","34","FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC","LUTZ","16125 E LAKE BURRELL DR, LUTZ, FL 33548 USA","0015-4040","1938-5102","","FLA ENTOMOL","Fla.

The rates of crack initiation and growth for this situation are not well understood because of the stochastic nature of the temperature fluctuations. Therefore, large allowances must be made when assessing the integrity of this pipe work to this failure mechanism. Improved assessment of crack initiation and growth could enable increased plant availability, and better safety cases. A programme of work has been completed consisting of fatigue tests on thick 304L butt-welded pipe specimens, and accompanying predictions of crack initiation and growth. In each test, uniform thermal cycles were generated using a water jet on a small area of the pipe. The magnitude of the cycles differed between the tests. Crack initiation and growth were monitored using a dye penetrant technique, applied to the pipe inner and outer surfaces, together with destructive examination. Crack initiation predictions were made using fatigue data derived from mechanical fatigue tests on the same material as in the pipe specimens. Good predictions were made using a strain-life endurance curve at a temperature corresponding to the average temperature of the metal surface during the thermal cycle. Crack growth predictions were based on an inelastic finite-element model accounting for cyclic hardening, and an enhanced R5 procedure (1) with crack closure taken into account. A linear elastic fracture mechanics definition of a Paris law for crack growth was used, and plastic redistribution effects were included. Predictions were good for all of the experimental scenarios carried out. A further experimental and analytical programme is in hand using the same experimental arrangements, concerning variable amplitude thermal loading.","","","","","","","","","",NA,"14","1","1","0","2","AMER SOC MECHANICAL ENGINEERS","NEW YORK","THREE PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10016-5990 USA","","","978-0-7918-4366-6","","","","2010",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"557","566","","","","","","10","Engineering, Mechanical","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering","BRF59",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000282619600064","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We have tested whether such relationships could account for the natural variability in elongation rates of taproot and secondary roots of sunflower (from 2 to 135 mm d-1), in field and laboratory conditions. Elongation of taproot and secondary roots was recorded daily through windows in the field. A range of PPFD was obtained by following day-to-day natural fluctuation for three contrasting growing periods, and by shading part of the plants under study. A parallel experiment was carried out in a growth chamber with contrasting light intensities and with a (CO2)-C-14 labelling experiment. After the two-leaf stage, i.e. when the contribution of photosynthetic carbon became appreciable in root growth, daily root elongation rate was closely linked to the PPFD intercepted from 36 to 12 h before the measurement of root elongation. Curvilinear relationships applied to plants grown in the field as well as in a growth chamber, and to shaded plants as well as to plants subjected to day-to-day changes in intercepted PPFD. For a given intercepted PPFD, the taproot elongated faster than secondary roots, and secondary roots originating near the base of the taproot elongated faster than those originating near the apex. The elongation rate of any secondary root apex was accounted for (r = 0-77) by the ratio of intercepted PPFD to the distance between the apex and the base of the taproot. No relationships between intercepted PPFD and elongation rate were observed before the two-leaf stage, when the CO2 labelling experiment suggests that carbon essentially originates from the seed. Therefore, this study suggests a role for source-sink relations in the distribution of elongation between apices and a role for carbon nutrition in day-to-day variations of root elongation rate. Precise mechanisms explaining this behaviour remain to be investigated.","INRA, ECOPHYSIOL PLANTES STRESS ENVIRONNMENTAUX LAB, 2 PL VIALA, F-34060 MONTPELLIER 1, FRANCE; INRA, AGRON LAB, F-78850 THIVERVAL GRIGNON, FRANCE; UNIV PARIS 11, STRUCT & METAB PLANTES LAB, CNRS, URAD 1128, F-91405 ORSAY, FRANCE","INRAE; AgroParisTech; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite Paris Saclay","","","Tardieu, Francois/I-3618-2012","","","","",NA,"24","58","59","0","10","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0140-7791","1365-3040","","PLANT CELL ENVIRON","Plant Cell Environ.","APR","1994","17","4","",NA,"",NA,"443","450","","10.1111/j.1365-3040.1994.tb00313.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1994.tb00313.x","","","8","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","ND358",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1994ND35800011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Canopy stomatal conductance (Gc) to water vapor was calculated from simultaneous measurements of canopy temperature (Tcan) and transpiration rates (Tr). Tr in the dark was substantial, and there were large diurnal fluctuations in both Gc and Tr. Canopy net photosynthesis (P-net), Tr, and Gc increased with increasing net radiation. Gc increased with Tr, suggesting that the stomata of plants in controlled environments (CEs) behave differently from field-grown plants. A transpiration model based on measurements of Gc was developed for CEs.

Huia) were analysed during 21 days of vegetative growth under natural light conditions, at constant root temperatures of 13 and 25 degrees C. Plants were established in flowing solution culture, and hourly rates of K+ uptake from solutions containing 2.5-6.5 mu M K+ were automatically measured without physical disturbance. Total daily solar radiation ranged between 1.3 and 12.5 MJ m(-2) day(-1) over the 21 days of measurements. Substantial diurnal changes in rates of K+ uptake, both absolutely and proportionately, were recorded on all but the day of lowest radiation (day 19), during which there was a period of net efflux of K+ from the root system into the flowing nutrient solutions at both temperatures. Typically, uptake rates increased severalfold during the first half of the light period, followed by several hours of relative stability during the afternoon; then a rapid decline throughout the evening and first half of the night, and finally gradual decline during the second half of the night. The data from a sequence of typical days were normalised and indicated that the pattern could be resolved into 4 distinct and linear phases, successively: (1) rapid acceleration, (2) stable uptake, (3) rapid deceleration, and (4) slow deceleration. The full data set (days 1-21) of hourly K+ uptake rates was Fourier-transformed and subjected to time-series analysis to determine whether there were significant ultradian rhythms in K+ uptake. Periodograms indicated a strong 24 h periodicity for uptake at both root temperatures. In addition, there were strong ultradian periodicities of 7 h for uptake at 13 degrees C and 4 h for uptake at 25 degrees C. The results are interpreted in terms of the possible mechanisms responsible for diurnal fluctuations in nutrient uptake.","","","Macduff, JH (corresponding author), AFRC, INST GRASSLAND & ENVIRONM RES, ABERYSTWYTH SY23 3EB, DYFED, WALES.","","","","","","",NA,"40","17","18","0","4","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0031-9317","1399-3054","","PHYSIOL PLANTARUM","Physiol.

Like many successfully farmed seaweed species, the sustainable development of Hizikia farming will rely on a stable supply of artificial seedlings via sexual reproduction under controlled conditions. However, the high rate of detachment of seedlings after transfer to open sea is one of the main obstacles, and has limited large-scale application of zygote-derived seedlings. To seek the optimal condition for growing seedlings on substratum in land-based tanks for avoidance of detachment in this investigation, young seedlings were grown in both outdoor tanks exposed directly to sunlight and in indoor raceway tanks in reduced, filtered sunlight. Results showed that young seedlings, immediately after fertilization, could withstand a daily fluctuation of direct solar irradiance up to a level of 1800 mu mol photons m(-1)s(-1), and maintained a faster growth rate than seedlings grown in indoor tanks. Detailed experiments by use of chlorophyll fluorescence measurements further demonstrated that the overnight (12 h) recovery of optimal fluorescence quantum yield (F-v/F-m) of seedlings after 1 h treatment at 40 degrees C was 98%, and the 48 h recovery of F-v/F-m of seedlings after 1 h exposure to 1800 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) was 92%. Forty-one-day-old seedlings showed no significant decrease of optimal fluorescence quantum yield at salinity ranging from 30 to 5 ppt for a treatment up to 17 h. Six-hour desiccation treatment did not have any influence on the optimal fluorescence quantum yield. Exposure to 18 mmol L-1 sodium hypochlorite for 10 min did not damage the PSII efficiency, and thus could be used to remove epiphytic algae. The strong tolerance of young seedlings to high temperature, high irradiance, low salinity and desiccation found in this investigation supports the view that mass production of Hizikia seedlings should be performed in ambient light and temperature instead of in shaded greenhouse tanks.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Marine Biol Culture Collect Ctr, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; Qingdao JinYing Ocean Sci Technol Dev Co Ltd, Qingdao 266520, Peoples R China; PingYang Nanji Isl Dev Co Ltd, Yotian Grp, Marine Aquaclture Res Stn, Pingyang 325401, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS","Pang, SJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Marine Biol Culture Collect Ctr, 7 Nanhai Rd, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China.","sjpang@ms.qdio.ac.cn","","","","","",NA,"19","33","45","2","27","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0921-8971","1573-5176","","J APPL PHYCOL","J.

Warming trends over the last couple of decades have coincided with the collapse of long-term population cycles in a broad range of taxa, although causal mechanisms are not well-understood. Larch budmoth (LBM) population dynamics across the European Alps, a classic example of regular outbreaks, inexplicably changed sometime during the 1980s after 1,200 y of nearly uninterrupted periodic outbreak cycles. Herein, analysis of perhaps the most extensive spatiotemporal dataset of population dynamics and reconstructed Alpine-wide LBM defoliation records reveals elevational shifts in LBM outbreak epicenters that coincide with temperature fluctuations over two centuries. A population model supports the hypothesis that temperature-mediated shifting of the optimal elevation for LBM population growth is the mechanism for elevational epicenter changes. Increases in the optimal elevation for population growth over the warming period of the last century to near the distributional limit of host larch likely dampened population cycles, thereby causing the collapse of a millennium-long outbreak cycle. The threshold-like change in LBM outbreak pattern highlights how interacting species with differential response rates to climate change can result in dramatic ecological changes.","[Johnson, Derek M.] Univ SW Louisiana, Dept Biol, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA; [Buentgen, Ulf; Frank, David C.] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Dendro Sci Unit, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Buentgen, Ulf; Frank, David C.] Univ Bern, Oeschger Ctr Climate Change Res, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Kausrud, Kyrre; Stenseth, Nils Chr.] Univ Oslo, Dept Biol, Ctr Ecol & Evolutionary Synth, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Haynes, Kyle J.] Univ Virginia, Boyce, VA 22620 USA; [Liebhold, Andrew M.] US Forest Serv, No Res Stn, USDA, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Esper, Jan] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Geog, D-55099 Mainz, Germany","University of Louisiana Lafayette; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; University of Bern; University of Oslo; University of Virginia; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Forest Service; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz","Johnson, DM (corresponding author), Univ SW Louisiana, Dept Biol, Box 42451, Lafayette, LA 70504 USA.","derekjohnson@louisiana.edu","Frank, David/C-7764-2013; Haynes, Kyle J./C-1374-2012; Johnson, Derek/B-6409-2012; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013; Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018; Liebhold, Andrew M./C-1423-2008; Stenseth, Nils Chr./G-5212-2016","Haynes, Kyle J./0000-0002-3283-6633; Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X; Liebhold, Andrew M./0000-0001-7427-6534; Stenseth, Nils Chr./0000-0002-1591-5399; Frank, David/0000-0001-5463-5640","US Department of Agriculture NRI [2006-35306-17264]; Swiss National Science Foundation (NCCR-Climate); Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis, University of Oslo","US Department of Agriculture NRI(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Swiss National Science Foundation (NCCR-Climate)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Centre for Ecological and Evolutionary Synthesis, University of Oslo","We thank Eugene Luzader for assistance in preparing Fig. 1.

Despite evidence that climate warming induces changes in water availability, acclimation responses to water restriction are understudied compared with thermal acclimation. In addition, acclimation responses may involve different modes, paces, and trade-offs between physiological and behavioral traits. Here, we tested the dynamical acclimation responses of a dry-skinned terrestrial ectotherm to chronic water restriction. Yearling common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) were exposed to sublethal water restriction during 2 mo of the summer season in laboratory conditions, then released in outdoor conditions for 10 additional months. Candidate behavioral (exploration, basking, and thermal preferences) and physiological (metabolism at rest and standard water loss rate) traits potentially involved in the acclimation response were measured repeatedly during and after water restriction. We observed a sequential acclimation response in water-restricted animals (yearlings spent less time basking during the first weeks of water deprivation) that was followed by delayed sex-specific physiological consequences of the water restriction during the following months (thermal depression in males and lower standard evaporative water loss rates in females). Despite short-term negative effects of water restriction on body growth, annual growth, survival, and reproduction were not significantly different between water-restricted and control yearlings. This demonstrates that beneficial acclimation responses to water restriction involve both short-term flexible behavioral responses and delayed changes in thermal and water biology traits.","[Rozen-Rechels, David; Meylan, Sandrine; Qitout, Kenza; Le Galliard, Jean-Francois] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, INRA, Inst Ecol & Sci Environm,Inst Rech Dev, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 5, France; [Dupoue, Andreaz] Univ Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Stn Eecol Theor & Expt, CNRS, UMR 5321, 2 Route CNRS, F-09200 Moulis, France; [Decenciere, Beatriz; Agostini, Simon; Le Galliard, Jean-Francois] Paris Sci & Lettres Res Univ, Ctr Rech Ecol Expt & Predict CEREEP Ecotron IleDe, Ecole Normale Super, Dept Biol,CNRS,UMR 3194, 78 Rue Chateau, F-77140 St Pierre Les Nemours, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL","Rozen-Rechels, D (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, INRA, Inst Ecol & Sci Environm,Inst Rech Dev, 4 Pl Jussieu, F-75252 Paris 5, France.","david.rozen-rechels@normalesup.org","; Le Galliard, Jean-Francois/E-8702-2011","Decenciere, Beatriz/0000-0002-2847-7631; Le Galliard, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-5965-9868; Sandrine, MEYLAN/0000-0002-0865-3335","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-13-JSV7-0011-01, ANR-17-CE02-0013]","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche(French National Research Agency (ANR))","We thank Arnaud Badiane and Xavier Raynaud for their help in improving the manuscript.

However, the plasticity in roles of CEF at contrasting temperatures is not well understood. We examined photosynthetic electron flow, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), PSI redox state, and electrochromic shift (ECS) signal at 25 degrees C (normal temperature) and 4 degrees C (low temperature) for leaves of a chilling-sensitive tree species Calotropis gigantea. We found that electron flow through PSII (ETRII) was largely depressed at 4 degrees C irrespective of light condition, whereas CEF was enhanced under light intensities below 500 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) but suppressed under light intensities above 760 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Meanwhile, both NPQ and PSI donor side limitation {Y(ND)] were enhanced at 4 degrees C. Moreover, the relationships between the rate of CEF and values for NPQ and Y(ND) changed between 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C. At low temperature, the proton gradient across thylakoid membranes (Delta pH) was enhanced and the thylakoid proton conductivity was depressed. Based on these results, we propose that, at normal growth temperature such as 25 degrees C, CEF contributes mainly to the balancing of ATP/NADPH energy budget required by primary metabolism. In contrast, at low temperature such as 4 degrees C, the main function of the CEF-dependent proton motive force is lumenal acidification, favoring photoprotection for photosynthetic apparatus. The plasticity in roles of CEF at contrasting temperatures may be regulated by the activity of thylakoid ATP synthase.","[Huang, Wei; Zhang, Shi-Bao; Xu, Jian-Chu] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Econ Plants & Biotechnol, Manning 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Tao] Yunnan Agr Univ, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr Gemplasm Utilizat, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Yunnan Agricultural University","Huang, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Econ Plants & Biotechnol, Manning 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Liu, T (corresponding author), Yunnan Agr Univ, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr Gemplasm Utilizat, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.","huangwei@mail.kib.ac.cn; 52133490@qq.com","Xu, Jianchu/Y-2890-2019","Huang, Wei/0000-0003-1854-6995","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31670343]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2016347]; Chinese Academy of Sciences' Frontier Science Key Project [QYZDY-SSW- SMC014]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0505101]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences' Frontier Science Key Project; National Key Research and Development Program of China","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 31670343), Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (to Wei Huang, grant number 2016347), and Chinese Academy of Sciences' Frontier Science Key Project (grant number QYZDY-SSW- SMC014) the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant number 2017YFC0505101).",NA,"81","26","27","1","27","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0098-8472","1873-7307","","ENVIRON EXP BOT","Environ.

The objective of this study is to analyse whether there are different effects of day temperature (T-D) and night temperature (T-X) on main-stem leaf appearance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Plants of 12 rice cultivars were grown al five constant temperatures (22, 24, 26, 28 and 32 degrees C) and four diurnally fluctuating temperatures (T-D/T-N: 26/22, 30/22, 22/26 and 22/30 degrees C) with a constant photoperiod of 12 h d(-1). The leaf appearance on the main stem was measured. A constant change in leaf appearance rate was observed during ontogeny. The relation between the number of emerged leaves and days from seedling emergence was described by a power-law equation with only one cultivar-specific parameter. Values for this parameter were estimated for the five constant temperature treatments, and the relation between this parameter and temperature was quantified by a nonlinear model. Leaf appearance for the four fluctuating temperature treatments could be accurately predicted on the basis of these relations in each cultivar. This indicated that there were no specific effects of T-D and T-N on leaf appearance in rice, in contrast with phenological development to flowering. The optimum temperature for leaf development was found to be substantially higher than for development to flowering. The final main-stem leaf number differed with diurnal temperature conditions. When a diurnal temperature delayed flowering, it increased the leaf number as well. This might explain why T-D and T-N had a different effect on development to flowering but not on leaf development.

The basis for diurnal temperature and photoperiod effects on stem elongation is associated with temperature fluctuation when stimuli occur during the period of most rapid stem elongation during a 24- hour cycle, i.e., the end of the scotoperiod and beginning of the photoperiod.

Moreover, studies of gradients may assist in an identification of the factors important to the outcomes of trophic interactions. We investigated the role of elevation-based variation in environmental conditions (temperature and relative humidity) and foliar nitrogen on tri-trophic interactions in Quercus gambelii Nutt. (Fagaceae) during 2001 and 2002. Quercus gambelii displayed significant elevational and seasonal fluctuation in foliar nitrogen content, and sites with similar environmental conditions produced similar foliar quality. However, leaf-miners, Phyllonorycter spec. (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) and Cameraria spec. (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), did not perform better on trees with a greater nitrogen content. Overall densities of both species declined significantly in 2002, most likely due to severe drought conditions in the south-western USA. Both species exhibited significant, but distinct, patterns in emergence rate with elevation. While environmentally based fluctuation in foliar nitrogen failed to predict the result of trophic interactions, site environmental conditions, as measured by temperature and relative humidity, were strongly related to differences in leaf-miner performance and mortality. The ordination of sites by variation in environmental conditions accurately predicts the relative effect of unexplained vs. natural-enemy sources of mortality for leaf-miners.","New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA","New Mexico State University","Yarnes, CT (corresponding author), New Mexico State Univ, Dept Biol, POB 30001,MSC 3AF, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.","cyarnes@nmsu.edu","","Yarnes, Christopher/0000-0003-4559-0465","","","",NA,"51","28","31","0","14","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0013-8703","1570-7458","","ENTOMOL EXP APPL","Entomol.

Temperature is a powerful factor determining the growth and development of macroalgae. Rational mariculture and an understanding of the dynamics of marine ecosystems require the study of the physicochemical basis of temperature adaptation. The key mechanism of this process is the redistribution of the fatty acid (FA) composition of polar lipids, maintaining the optimal liquid-crystalline state of the biomembrane lipid matrix. In the conditions of increasing ambient temperature variability, the rate of changes aimed at the thermal adaptation of ectothermic organisms, which include plants, becomes particularly important. However, to date, the effect of the temperature acclimation rate on ectothermic organisms has been little studied. The present paper aims to study the ability of S. japonica to adapt the physicochemical properties of the main polar lipids to elevated ambient temperature at different rates of seawater heating. Algae were collected in the Sea of Japan in winter at a water temperature of 4 degrees C and warmed to a summer temperature of 20 degrees C at rates of 16 degrees C/d (rapid acclimation) and 2 degrees C/d (slow acclimation). We isolated glycolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) from acclimated algae as well as their thalli, collected in winter and summer, and studied their FA composition, the composition of molecular species and thermal transitions from crystalline state to liquid crystalline state, which is optimal for functioning of biomembranes, by GLC, HPLC-MS and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's t-test (p <= 0.05). The results of this study showed that rapid thermal acclimation caused an increase in the unsaturation index (UI) and the ratio of unsaturated/saturated FA of the main lipid of thylakoid membranes MGDG (See Table 1), in contrast to both acclimatization and acclimation changes in the FA composition of the remaining glycolipids DGDG and SQDG when a season changes from winter to summer (See Tables 2-3). The opposite character of changes in the unsaturation of the FA composition of MGDG compared with DGDG and SQDG was also preserved during slow thermal acclimation. Slow warming only strengthened this feature in MGDG, contributed to increasing the unsaturation of FA composition of DGDG as opposed to the effect of rapid acclimation or weakened its effect in SQDG. The ratio of n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the decrease of which, that is, increase in the share of n-6 PUFAs in polar lipids of marine macrophytes during thermal acclimatization is important both for regulating the viscosity of membrane lipids, and for strengthening mediators derived from PUFAs in the physiologically active season. However, during thermal acclimation, the n-3/n-6 ratio of PUFAs changed a little in MGDG and SQDG of S. japonica regardless of the acclimation rate. Only in DGDG, the n-3/n-6 ratio of PUFAs decreased in accordance with the seasonal trend, especially at rapid acclimation. These changes in the FA composition of glycolipids were accompanied by equally ambiguous changes in their thermotropic behavior. Thermal acclimation caused the phase separation of MGDG, which was characterized by splitting of the peak of crystal - liquid crystal thermal transition of the glycolipid into the low and high temperature peaks, while the seasonal effect contributed to a decrease in the peak maximum temperature (T-max) to the low temperature region by 20 degrees C (See Fig. 1a). Phase separation of MGDG was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of molecular PUFA/PUFA forms, as well as monounsaturated FA (MUFA)/PUFA, and a decrease in saturated FA (SFA)/ PUFA (See Table 4). However, the warming up of sea water at a rate of 16 degrees C/d and 2 degrees C/d was not enough to bring the profile of the thermogram acclimatization and acclimation closer to that of the summer sample. Similar acclimation changes, which had a character of the emerging trend of fitting the profile of thermograms, were observed in the DGDG and SQDG calorimetric transitions (See Fig. 1b, c), which were based not so much on the FA composition as a whole but on the composition of their molecular species/forms (See Tables 5-6). Consequently, an increase in seawater temperature from 4 degrees C to 20 degrees C at rates of 16 degrees C/d or 2 degrees C/d showed an ambiguous, stressful nature of the FA composition and calorimetric transitions of glycolipids from S. japonica during thermal acclimation. The low efficiency of molecular mechanisms underlying maintenance of the liquid crystalline state of the main polar lipids of S. japonica that is optimal for functioning of the membranes is probably due to cold-loving nature and absence of sharp temperature fluctuations in the natural habitats of this species of marine macroalgae.","[Barkina, Maria Yu.; Pomazenkova, Ludmila A.; Chopenko, Natalia S.; Velansky, Peter V.; Kostetsky, Eduard Ya.; Sanina, Nina M.] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Biochem Microbiol & Biotechnol, Sch Nat Sci, 8 Sukhanova Str, Vladivostok 690091, Russia","Far Eastern Federal University","Barkina, MY (corresponding author), Far Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Biochem Microbiol & Biotechnol, Sch Nat Sci, 8 Sukhanova Str, Vladivostok 690091, Russia.","marybarkin@yandex.ru; l.vorobushek@mail.ru; natali_1389@mail.ru; velanskiy.pv@dvfu.ru; kostetskiy.yeya@dvfu.ru; sanina.nm@dvfu.ru","Peter, Velansky/AHC-4076-2022; Chopenko, Natalia/AAL-6449-2020; Sanina, Nina/D-7581-2015","Chopenko, Natalia/0000-0002-0102-6507; Sanina, Nina/0000-0001-5838-691X","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [6.5736.2017/6.7]","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation)","This research was funded by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, the State Assignment No 6.5736.2017/6.7.",NA,"34","1","1","0","8","TOMSKIJ GOSUDARSTVENNYI UNIV","TOMSK","BIOL INST, 36 LENINA ST, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA","1998-8591","2311-2077","","VESTN TOMSK GOS U BI","Vestn.

On large spatial scales, heat stress is the most common factor causing bleaching, which is predicted to increase in frequency and severity as the climate warms. There is evidence that the temperature threshold at which bleaching occurs varies with local environmental conditions and background climate conditions. We investigated the influence of past temperature variability on coral susceptibility to bleaching, using the natural gradient in peak temperature variability in the Gilbert Islands, Republic of Kiribati. The spatial pattern in skeletal growth rates and partial mortality scars found in massive Porites sp. across the central and northern islands suggests that corals subject to larger year-to-year fluctuations in maximum ocean temperature were more resistant to a 2004 warm-water event. In addition, a subsequent 2009 warm event had a disproportionately larger impact on those corals from the island with lower historical heat stress, as indicated by lower concentrations of triacylglycerol, a lipid utilized for energy, as well as thinner tissue in those corals. This study indicates that coral reefs in locations with more frequent warm events may be more resilient to future warming, and protection measures may be more effective in these regions.","[Carilli, Jessica] Australian Nucl Sci & Technol Org, Inst Environm Res, Lucas Heights, NSW, Australia; [Donner, Simon D.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Hartmann, Aaron C.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Australian Nuclear Science & Technology Organisation; University of British Columbia; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography","Carilli, J (corresponding author), Australian Nucl Sci & Technol Org, Inst Environm Res, Lucas Heights, NSW, Australia.","jcarilli@gmail.com","","","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization; United States National Science Foundation","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization; United States National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work was supported by a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant (SDD; www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca), an Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization Postdoctoral Fellowship (JC; ansto.gov.au), and a United States National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (ACH; www.nsf.gov).

In this study, four management systems are compared for determining management-induced changes in soil temperature at different depths: (i) conventional tillage (T-C) with the standard rate of N fertilizer (P1N1), (ii) conventional tillage with the half-standard rate of N fertilizer (P1N0), (iii) reduced tillage (T-R) with the standard rate of N fertilizer (P0N1), and iv) reduced tillage with the half-standard rate of N fertilizer (P0N0). Temporal analysis of soil temperature is assessed to examine data observed at a specific time to achieve a better understanding of the soil temperature dynamic that occurs at different time scales. The results showed that the soil temperature has decreasing amplitudes and increasing phase shifts with increasing soil depth, i.e., the deeper the measurement depth, the smoother the soil temperature changes cycle and the smaller the variability. Results showed that the diurnal temperature variation is found up to 45 cm depth of soil whereas annual temperature variation is up to a depth of 180 cm. The results, moreover, revealed that soil temperature dynamic was affected by tillage systems and fertilization and a time lag is observed between the temperature fluctuations at the surface and deeper layers, due to induced management effects on plant cover, residues, and soil properties. Although higher soil temperature at the sowing stage under TR is contributed to higher amounts of surface crop residues in crop rotations, the effect of residues on soil temperature variation reduces with an increase in percent plant cover and shading of soil, which happens in the last stage of plant growth. At the last stage of crop development regardless of tillage systems, applying more N fertilization increased crop yield, resulting in cooling soil temperature.","[Jarrah, Mahboube; Mayel, Sonia; Kuka, Katrin] Julius Kuhn Inst JKI, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, Inst Crop & Soil Sci, Bundesallee 58, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany; [Jarrah, Mahboube; Mayel, Sonia] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geoecol, Landscape Ecol & Environm Syst Anal, Langer Kamp 19c, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Franko, Uwe] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Soil Syst Sci, D-06120 Halle, Germany","Julius Kuhn-Institut; Braunschweig University of Technology; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research (UFZ)","Jarrah, M (corresponding author), Julius Kuhn Inst JKI, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, Inst Crop & Soil Sci, Bundesallee 58, D-38116 Braunschweig, Germany.;Jarrah, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geoecol, Landscape Ecol & Environm Syst Anal, Langer Kamp 19c, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.","mahboubejarrah@julius-kuehn.de; sonia.mayel@julius-kuehn.de; uwe.franko@ufz.de; katrin.kuka@julius-kuehn.de","","Franko, Uwe/0000-0002-1516-4003; Jarrah, Mahboube/0000-0001-6811-6892","Research Centre for Cultivated Plants, Institute for Crop and Soil Science, Julius-Kuhn Institut, Braunschweig, Germany","Research Centre for Cultivated Plants, Institute for Crop and Soil Science, Julius-Kuhn Institut, Braunschweig, Germany","Appreciation is extended to Research Centre for Cultivated Plants, Institute for Crop and Soil Science, Julius-Kuhn Institut, Braunschweig, Germany for the financial support and provision of the working equipment, and the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany for the professional support.

The growth of fine roots is usually affected by forest intervention. This study aims to investigate the fine root mass, production, and turnover in the disturbed forest. Methods The seasonal and vertical distributions of fine root (diameter <= 2 mm) were measured in a Chinese cork oak (Quercus variabilis Blume) forest. The biomass and necromass of roots with diameters <= 1 mm and 1-2 mm in 0-40 cm soil profiles were sampled by using a sequential soil coring method in the stands after clear cutting for 3 years, with the stands of the remaining intact trees as the control. Results The fine root biomass (FRB) and fine root necromass (FRN) varied during the growing season and reached their peak in August. Lower FRB and higher FRN were found in the clear cutting stands. The ratio between FRN and FRB increased after forest clear cutting compared with the control and was the highest in June. The root mass with diameter <= 1 mm was affected proportionately more than that of diameter 1-2 mm root. Clear cutting reduced FRB and increased FRN of roots both <= 1 mm and 1-2 mm in diameter along the soil depths. Compared with the control, the annual fine root production and the average turnover rate decreased by 30.7 % and 20.7 %, respectively, after clear cutting for 3 years. The decline of canopy cover contributed to the dramatic fluctuation of soil temperature and moisture from April to October. With redundancy discriminate analysis (RDA) analysis, the first axis was explained by soil temperature (positive) and moisture (negative) in the control stands. Aboveground stand structure, including canopy cover, sprout height, and basal area, influenced FRB and FRN primarily after forest clear cutting. Conclusions This study suggested that the reduction of fine root biomass, production, and turnover rate can be attributed to the complex changes that occur after forest intervention, including canopy damage, increased soil temperature, and degressive soil moisture.","[Ma, Chuang; Zhang, Wenhui; Wu, Min; Ma, Liwei; Zhou, Jianyun] Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Environm & Ecol Educ Minist West China, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Xue, Yaoqin] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Life Sci, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China","Zhang, WH (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Environm & Ecol Educ Minist West China, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.","wenhuizhang@sohu.com","","zhang, wenhui/0000-0003-1786-6356","National Natural Science Foundation of China [30872018]; Forestry Industry Research Special Funds for Public Welfare Projects of China [201004011]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Forestry Industry Research Special Funds for Public Welfare Projects of China","The authors thank Bao Changhu, Wang Chenglei and Wang Rui for assistance in the field and laboratory.

We examined how daily temperature fluctuations, average temperature, day length and vernalization influence the flowering time of 59 genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with allelic perturbations known to affect flowering time. For a subset of genotypes, we also assessed treatment effects on morphology and growth. We identified 17 genotypes, many of which have high levels of the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), that bolted dramatically earlier in fluctuating - as opposed to constant - warm temperatures (mean=22 degrees C). This acceleration was not caused by transient VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3-mediated vernalization, differential growth rates or exposure to high temperatures, and was not apparent when the average temperature was cool (mean=12 degrees C). Further, in constant temperatures, contrary to physiological expectations, these genotypes flowered more rapidly in cool than in warm environments. Fluctuating temperatures often reversed these responses, restoring faster bolting in warm conditions. Independently of bolting time, warm fluctuating temperature profiles also caused morphological changes associated with shade avoidance or high-temperature' phenotypes. Our results suggest that previous studies have overestimated the effect of the floral repressor FLC on flowering time by using constant temperature laboratory conditions.","[Burghardt, Liana T.; Wilczek, Amity M.; Cooper, Martha D.; Schmitt, Johanna] Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Burghardt, Liana T.] Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Runcie, Daniel E.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Ecol & Evolut, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wilczek, Amity M.; Schmitt, Johanna] Deep Springs Coll, Big Pine, CA 93513 USA; [Roe, Judith L.] Univ Maine, Dept Biol, Presque Isle, ME 04769 USA; [Welch, Stephen M.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agron, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Burghardt, Liana T.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA","Brown University; Duke University; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Maine Presque Isle; Kansas State University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities","Burghardt, LT (corresponding author), Brown Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Providence, RI 02912 USA.;Burghardt, LT (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.;Burghardt, LT (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Plant Biol, St Paul, MN 55108 USA.","liana.burghardt@gmail.com","Burghardt, Liana T/K-5465-2019","Burghardt, Liana T/0000-0002-0239-1071; Runcie, Daniel/0000-0002-3008-9312","National Science Foundation (NSF) [EF-0425759, DEB-1020111]; NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology [1202838]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1447203] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)National Research Foundation of Korea); NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This work was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) grants EF-0425759 and DEB-1020111.

Highest constant temperature (30 degrees C) reduced the density of M. macrocopa. The cladocerans under the fluctuating temperature regime too had lower population growth (about 50% lower than that at constant 25 degrees C). The survivorship of M. macrocopa was higher at 20 degrees C than that at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C or at variable temperature regime. Gross and net reproductive rates were higher at 25 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, neonates had the highest proportion (67%) of myristic, palmitic and stearic acids while the adults had the lowest (26%) proportion. For both adults and neonates, palmitoleic, linoleic and linolenic comprised of 15-35% of the total fatty acids. Higher percentage (19%) of linoleic acid was present in adults than neonates (7%). Adults had linolenic acid level which was 3-times higher than in neonates. Linoleic and linolenic fatty acids decreased with increasing temperature for neonates and adults from 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C.

Several environmental factors make it difficult to fully rely on local resources for agriculture. These include nutrient sparse regolith, low and fluctuating temperatures, a high amount of ultraviolet radiation, and water trapped locally in the form of ice or metal oxides. While the 96% CO2 martian atmosphere is ideal to support photosynthesis, high CO2 concentrations inhibit germination. An added difficulty is the fact that a vast majority of crop plants require oxygen for germination. Here, we report the production of a polymer-based oxygen delivery system that supports the germination and growth of cress seeds (Lepidium sativum) in a martian regolith simulant under a martian atmosphere at 101 kPa. The oxygen-donating system is based on a low-density lightly cross-linked polyacrylate that is foamed and converted into a dry powder. It is lightweight, added in low amounts to regolith simulant, and efficiently donates enough oxygen throughout the volume of hydrated regolith simulant to fully support seed germination and plant growth. Germination rates, plant development, and plant mass are nearly identical for L. sativum grown in 100% CO2 in the presence of the oxygen-donating lightly cross-linked polyacrylate compared with plants grown in air. The polymer system also serves to protect root structures and better anchors plants in the regolith simulant.","[MacDonald, John G.; Rodriguez, Karien; Quirk, Stephen] Kimberly Clark Inc, 1400 Holcomb Bridge Rd, Roswell, GA 30076 USA","Kimberly-Clark","Quirk, S (corresponding author), Kimberly Clark Inc, 1400 Holcomb Bridge Rd, Roswell, GA 30076 USA.","squirk@kcc.com","","Quirk, Stephen/0000-0002-4497-1023","Kimberly-Clark Corp.","Kimberly-Clark Corp.","This research was funded by an internal research innovation grant from Kimberly-Clark Corp.

The growth of the seagrass was examined in the light of climate fluctuations and local stresses. colonisation by alien, invasive alga Cauterpa taxifolia, and effects of the oil spill from the tanker Haven, and other anthropogenic impacts. Both shoot density and lepidochronology pointed to a generalised state of regression of all the meadows. The analysis of long-term growth curves of the rhizomes showed a positive trend parallel to the increase of air temperature. Two main groups of meadows were individuated on the basis of growth curve similarity. The first included four meadows, namely Ventimiglia.. Imperia, Noli and Prelo, that were characterised by average values of rhizome growth of 8-9.1 mm year(-1) and shoot density greater than 200 shoots m(-2). Although the Imperia meadow was the only one where the alien invasive alga C taxifolia was found, it did not show differences for rhizome growth in comparison to the other meadows. The second group was formed by meadows that had suffered past anthropogenic impacts: Arenzano and Monterosso al Mare. They showed higher rhizome growth rates (9.4-10.6 min year(-1)) and shoot densities between 200 and 100 shoots m(-2). At Arenzano, where Haven oil was stranded in April 1991, no rhizome older than 8 years was found, thus confirming the shoot mortality induced by the oil spill event. The two last meadows exhibited growth curves very different from all the others: Portovenere, is a shallow meadow where P. oceanica merely survives in an extremely degraded situation with highest rhizome growth rate (12 mm year(-1)), the other, Riva Trigoso, is the only meadow implanted on rock and had the lowest growth rates (7.1 mm year(-1)).

We hypothesize that short term (daily) temperature fluctuation will alleviate nutrient limitation. We carried out experiments analysing growth rates, phosphorus and RNA content of D. commutate grown under four different temperature regimes and two P-limited conditions. Our experiments showed that individuals grown under fluctuating temperature grew more than at the mean temperature. We estimated the expected sizes for the 15 degrees C treatment based on the Q(10) and for the fluctuating temperature treatment. These expected sizes for both treatments resulted well below the observed ones. The P and RNA content of individuals grown at 10 degrees C were significantly higher than those at 20 degrees C, and when individuals grown at 10 degrees C were translocated to 20 degrees C they exerted an increased growth rate. Our results suggest that, under a regime of diel vertical migration, the temperature alternation would allow migrating organisms to alleviate the effect of severe nutrient limitation maintaining population growth. Under a scenario of global warming, where epilimnetic temperatures will increase, lake temperature will interact with nutrient limitation for consumers, but, organisms may be able to face these changes if they can still regularly move from a cold hypolimnion to a warmer epilimnion.","[Balseiro, Esteban; Laspoumaderes, Cecilia; Modenutti, Beatriz] Univ Comahue, Lab Limnol, INIBIOMA, CONICET, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Laspoumaderes, Cecilia] Helmholtz Zentrum Polar & Meeresforsch, Alfred Wegener Inst, Helgoland, Germany; [Smufer, Facundo] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, GRIL, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Wolinski, Laura] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Lab Ecol Fisiol & Evolut Organismos Acuat, CADIC, Ushuaia, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional del Comahue; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","Balseiro, E (corresponding author), Univ Comahue, Lab Limnol, INIBIOMA, CONICET, Quintral 1250, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.","ebalseiro@comahue-conicet.gob.ar","","Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; Wolinski, Laura/0000-0002-8461-2578; Smufer, Facundo/0000-0002-1259-1085; Laspoumaderes, Cecilia/0000-0001-7790-2975; Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587","FONCyT [PICT2015-0418, PICT2017-1940, PICT2018-1563]; CONICET [PUE2016-0008]; UNComahue [B236]","FONCyT(FONCyT); CONICET(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); UNComahue","We thank Sebastian Diehl and Maarten Boersma for their comments on earlier versions, that greatly improved this manuscript.

Miller) is a CAM plant with an extraordinary capacity to store water in its succulent stems (cladodes). However, the daily variations of cladode thickness is unknown. Studying cladode thickness fluctuations may be useful for the early prediction of plant dehydration stress. The objective of this study was to determine if age, water availability and temperature influence diel cladode shrinkage and enlargement dynamics in cactus pear. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse from April to July 2014, using cactus pear plants, equally split into irrigated and unirrigated treatments, and unrooted cladodes detached from mother plants. Soil moisture content (SMC), soil water depletion over 24-h, cladode relative water content (RWC), cladode thickness, stomatal conductance (g(s)), cladode growth rates (area increase) and nocturnal malic acid accumulation were monitored in plants of various ages. Cladode shrinkage and enlargement dynamics were assessed using stem gauges and expressed as absolute growth rate (AGR(thickness), mu m min(-1)). In unirrigated pots, drought decreased SMC, RWC,cladode thickness, cladode growth rate and gs. Younger cladodes lost water later than older ones. Detached cladodes exhibited gs activity 3-4 months after detachment. Trends of AGR(thickness) showed that there was a progressive reduction of diel swelling and shrinkage fluctuations as cladodes aged. Such fluctuations were minimized under severe drought when 1-year-old cladodes reached 8 mm thickness and a RWC of about 45%. A positive correlation was found between SMC and AGR(thickness). Temperatures were also directly correlated with AGR(thickness), although this relationship was gradually lost as SMC decreased. Overall, cactus pears were able to maintain some growth at very low hydration levels, and cladode growth was highly responsive to rehydration after long periods of drought. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In a Sonoran Desert winter annual plant community, we have identified a tradeoff between relative growth rate (RGR) and water-use efficiency (WUE) that predicts interannual variation in reproductive success. Here we test the hypothesis that traits underlying RGR and WUE differences are linked to seasonal phenology. Methods: We use long-term demographic data and finer-scale, short-term data to investigate timing of germination, reproduction, and death of several winter annual species in multiple years in open and under-shrub habitats. We hypothesized that species with high WUE and less interannual demographic variability would have life cycle transitions early in the winter to spring growing season. This would be due to an ability to use small amounts of rain and photosynthesize at low temperatures. By contrast, we hypothesized that species with low WUE whose survival and reproductive rates vary greatly from year to year would have life cycle transitions later in the season. Key Results: In any given year, species with high WUE germinated and reproduced earlier in the season than species with low WUE, whereas low-WUE species germinated later and had shorter reproductive phases. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a direct relationship between phenology and physiological trait differences. This link between phenology and physiology is of interest because it clarifies the mechanism by which trait differences determine species' relative abundances.","[Kimball, Sarah; Huxman, Travis E.; Venable, D.

However, the combined effects of mulching type and planting density on maize growth and yield have been seldom studied, especially in different hydrological years. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of mulching type and planting density on the soil temperature, growth, grain yield (GY), water use efficiency (WUE) and economic benefit of rainfed maize in the drylands of northern China during 2015-2017. Precipitation fluctuated over the three years. There were four mulching types (NM, flat cultivation with non-mulching; SM, flat cultivation with straw mulching; RP, plastic-mulched ridge plus bare furrow; RPFS, plastic-mulched ridge plus straw-mulched furrow) and three planting densities (LD, low planting density, 45.0x10(3) plants/hm(2); MD, medium planting density, 67.5x10(3) plants/hm(2); HD, high planting density, 90.0x10(3) plants/hm(2)). Results showed that soil temperature was higher with RP and lower with SM compared with NM, but no significant difference was found between RPFS and NM. More soil water was retained by soil mulching at the early growth stage, but it significantly varied at the middle and late growth stages. Maize growth was significantly improved by soil mulching. With increasing planting density, stem diameter, net photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content tended to decline, whereas a single-peak trend in biomass yield was observed. Mulching type and planting density did not have significant effect on evapotranspiration (ET), but GY and WUE were significantly affected. There were significant interacting effects of mulching type and planting density on biomass yield, GY, ET and WUE. Compared with NM, RPFS, RP and SM increased GY by 57.5%, 50.8% and 18.9%, and increased WUE by 66.6%, 54.3% and 18.1%, respectively. At MD, GY increased by 41.4% and 25.2%, and WUE increased by 38.6% and 22.4% compared with those of at LD and HD.

Mitochondria regulate the energy production of cells in responding to environmental fluctuation, but studying their contribution to the thermal adaptation of species is limited. This knowledge is needed to predict future disease epidemiology for ecology conservation and food security. Spatial distributions of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in 405 Phytophthora infestans isolates originating from 15 locations were characterized. The contribution of MtDNA to thermal adaptation was evaluated by comparative analysis of mtDNA frequency and intrinsic growth rate, relative population differentiation in nuclear and mtDNA, and associations of mtDNA distribution with local geography climate conditions. Significant variation in frequency, intrinsic growth rate, and spatial distribution was detected in mtDNA. Population differentiation in mtDNA was significantly higher than that in the nuclear genome, and spatial distribution of mtDNA was strongly associated with local climatic conditions and geographic parameters, particularly air temperature, suggesting natural selection caused by a local temperature is the main driver of the adaptation. Dominant mtDNA grew faster than the less frequent mtDNA. Our results provide useful insights into the evolution of pathogens under global warming. Given its important role in biological functions and adaptation to local air temperature, mtDNA intervention has become an increasing necessity for future disease management. To secure ecological integrity and food production under global warming, a synergistic study on the interactive effect of changing temperature on various components of biological and ecological functions of mitochondria in an evolutionary frame is urgently needed.","[Shen, Lin-Lin; Waheed, Abdul; Wang, Zong-Hua; Yang, Li-Na] Minjiang Univ, Inst Oceanog, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yan-Ping] Chengdu Normal Univ, Sichuan Prov Key Lab Dev & Utilizat Characterist H, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Nkurikiyimfura, Oswald] Fujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Inst Plant Virol, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Jiasui] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Mycol & Plant Pathol, Uppsala, Sweden","Minjiang University; Chengdu Normal University; Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","Yang, LN (corresponding author), Minjiang Univ, Inst Oceanog, Fuzhou, Peoples R China.","yikeshu1114@126.com","wang, yi/HOF-6668-2023; Wang, Yin/HCI-9352-2022; Wang, Yu/GZL-9655-2022; Wang, Yanbo/HFZ-8018-2022; wangwangwang, yuanyaunyuan/HHN-6432-2022; Wang, Yuan/HHC-1520-2022; Wang, Ying/HJI-2509-2023; wang, yan/GSE-6489-2022","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31761143010, 31901861, U1405213]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","Funding This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31761143010, 31901861, and U1405213 grant to JZ and L-NY).",NA,"73","0","0","8","14","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","1664-302X","","FRONT MICROBIOL","Front.

The model was validated using 2 (5 to 15 degrees C; 600 h and 10 to 40 degrees C; 52 h) sinusoidal, continuously varying temperature profiles. LWE adjusted to pH 7.8 was inoculated with approximately 2.5-3.0 log CFU/mL of Salmonella spp., and the growth data at several isothermal conditions (5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, and 47 degrees C) was collected. A primary model (Baranyi model) was fitted for each temperature growth data and corresponding maximum growth rates were estimated. Pseudo-R2 values were greater than 0.97 for primary models. Modified Ratkowsky model was used to fit the secondary model. The pseudo-R2 and root mean square error were 0.99 and 0.06 log CFU/mL, respectively, for the secondary model. A dynamic model for the prediction of Salmonella spp. growth under varying temperature conditions was developed using 4th-order Runge-Kutta method. The developed dynamic model was validated for 2 sinusoidal temperature profiles, 5 to 15 degrees C (for 600 h) and 10 to 40 degrees C (for 52 h) with corresponding root mean squared error values of 0.28 and 0.23 log CFU/mL, respectively, between predicted and observed Salmonella spp. populations. The developed dynamic model can be used to predict the growth of Salmonella spp. in LWE under varying temperature conditions. Practical Application Liquid egg and egg products are widely used in food processing and in restaurant operations. These products can be contaminated with Salmonella spp. during breaking and other unit operations during processing. The raw, liquid egg products are stored under refrigeration prior to pasteurization. However, process deviations can occur such as refrigeration failure, leading to temperature fluctuations above the required temperatures as specified in the critical limits within hazard analysis and critical control point plans for the operations. The processors are required to evaluate the potential growth of Salmonella spp. in such products before the product can be used, or further processed.

During power generation, flow and temperature were the two main environmental factors modified. The downstream distribution of the various taxa reflected both the impact of hydropeaking and the natural zonation. The lowest densities and biomasses were estimated at 700 m downstream from the plant, underlining the prominent role of hydropeaking. Above the plant, Plecoptera larvae showed a constant drift due to accidental dislodgement, and behavioural drift was mainly nocturnal. Below the plant, the flushing action of peaking flows added to this a catastrophic drift, which was even higher since the amplitude between natural flow and peak flow was elevated. The life cycle patterns and the growth rates of the five dominating species (Siphonoperla torrentium, Isoperla acicularis, Perla grandis, Amphinemura sulcicollis, Protonemura beatensis) were similar at the various sampling sites, and only slight differences in hatching and/or emergence periods were recorded. The Plecoptera of the Oriege complete their larval development during periods where artificial thermal fluctuations are low and have a minor effect on the populations: from autumn to spring-i.e. when the temperatures remain rather low and during snow melt flood (e.g. S. torrentium, I. acicularis, A. sulcicollis)-or in summer when hypolimnetic releases increase the daily thermal fluctuations but reduce the mean diel temperatures (e.g. P. beatensis). Therefore, under this kind of river regulation, the plecopteran population structure and distribution is mainly governed by hydraulic disturbances.

A specific sequence of vascular plants characterizes the temporal development of these systems. The edaphic end point of the succession is apparently attained with a herb-shrub-tree stage with Pinus taeda as the dominant tree. We studied the characteristics of this stage and the population structure of P. taeda on outcrop islands in order to specify the successional status of the species in this habitat. We compared the radial growth pattern of outcrop and Piedmont populations of P. taeda, and of two outcrop sub-populations. We checked whether trees on outcrops experience more limiting conditions than trees on the Piedmont, and studied the recent change in the relationship between growth and stress (e.g. drought and atmospheric deposition) reported for loblolly pine in the southeastern United States. We also attempted to identify the climatic variables most critical for tree growth on outcrops. On outcrop soil islands, P. taeda maintains populations that are of irregular age distribution, possibly in response to irregular recruitment and survival. There are no signs of loblolly pine replacement by hardwood species on any of the islands studied, although an understory of shrubby oak appears to characterize larger and deeper-soil islands. Although trees on the Piedmont were growing at a higher rate than those on the outcrop in the first part of the 1950-1988 period, their growth declined at a higher rate than that of trees on the outcrop. As a result, at the end of the period considered (1950-1988), the differences in radial growth between outcrop and Piedmont populations were relatively small. On the outcrop, trees less-than-or-equal-to 22 yr old in 1989 were growing at a rate somewhat lower than that of trees of similar age, 40 yr ago. Differences were apparent in the initial growth patterns between the two outcrop subpopulations (1989 and 1949 stems), and these could have resulted from differences in competition regime, stress or climatic conditions, or a combination thereof. However, a repeated-measures ANOVA failed to reveal a significant recent decrease in the radial growth of loblolly pine in the system studied. The identification of numerous signature years (years with greater-than-or-equal-to 80% of the trees with similar increasing or decreasing trend in their radial growth) suggests that similar environmental variables control the growth of loblolly pine in both outcrop and Piedmont habitats. High temperature and low precipitation in the first part of the summer (June-July) seem to limit radial growth. Those pines growing on outcrop soil islands, however, appear more sensitive to climatic fluctuations.","","","HOULE, G (corresponding author), UNIV LAVAL,CTR ETUD NORD,ST FOY G1K 7P4,QUEBEC,CANADA.","","","","","","",NA,"0","7","7","0","19","OPULUS PRESS UPPSALA AB","KNIVSTA","APELSINVAGEN 47, S 741 00 KNIVSTA, SWEDEN","1100-9233","","","J VEG SCI","J.

'Champion'), carrot (Daucus carota L. 'Adelaide'), and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. 'Beefsteak') in three separate greenhouses with contrasting design technologies. The greenhouses were categorized as (i) high technology (HTG), (ii) medium technology (MTG), and (iii) low technology (LTG) greenhouses. The MTG and LTG were basic facilities but the MTG had in-floor heating. The HTG was fully equipped with climate control systems. Mean monthly air temperature was stable at 23 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C in the HTG but fluctuated in the MTG and LTG. Air temperature and water loss were highest in the MTG. Vapour pressure deficit and daily light integral followed the trends LTG > MTG > HTG > ambient and ambient > MTG > HTG > LTG, respectively. The growth rate of collard plants was equally high in the MTG and the LTG compared with the HTG. Comparatively, the growth and yield of carrot plants were highest in the HTG. Conditions in the HTG and the MTG favored the growth and yield of the tomato plants. Thus, the different greenhouse design technologies created different microclimates, which differentially affected growth and yield performances of the different vegetable species. Future work should consider the economic benefits of greenhouse technology and production management for northern and remote communities.","[Abbey, Lord; Rao, Sajjad Ali] Assiniboine Community Coll, Sch Business Agr & Environm, Brandon, MB R7A 2Y1, Canada; [Abbey, Lord] Dalhousie Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Food & Environm Sci, 50 Pictou Rd,POB 550, Truro, NS B2N 5E3, Canada","Dalhousie University","Abbey, L (corresponding author), Assiniboine Community Coll, Sch Business Agr & Environm, Brandon, MB R7A 2Y1, Canada.","loab07@gmail.com","","","Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada; Manitoba Ministry of Agriculture through the Canada-Manitoba Growing Forward 2 program, a federal-provincial territorial initiative","Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada(Agriculture & Agri Food Canada); Manitoba Ministry of Agriculture through the Canada-Manitoba Growing Forward 2 program, a federal-provincial territorial initiative","Funding for this project was provided by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Manitoba Ministry of Agriculture through the Canada-Manitoba Growing Forward 2 program, a federal-provincial territorial initiative.",NA,"23","1","1","1","11","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS","OTTAWA","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA","0008-4220","1918-1833","","CAN J PLANT SCI","Can.

Rings were rarely detected when the low point was 28-degrees-C. The rings seemed to correspond to alternating regions of high and low cellulose accumulation. Fibers developed in vitro under 34-degrees-C/28-degrees-C cycling developed similarly to constant 34-degrees-C controls, but 34-degrees-C/22-degrees-C and 34-degrees-C/15-degrees-C cycling caused delayed onset and prolonged periods of elongation and secondary wall thickening.

These fish have large fluctuations in biomass, the mechanism of which remains unclear. This study developed a bioenergetics individual-based model for chub mackerel distributed in the Northwest Pacific and evaluated the dominant environmental factors that affect their early life history. The parameters in the bioenergetics model were obtained or estimated from previous studies, and a migration model with a gradient area search algorithm was coupled. The growth rate of chub mackerel was calibrated to in situ growth data by adjusting the half-saturation constant of consumption (K). During 2002-2016, the growth and migration of chub mackerel were reproduced using the model with satellite-derived forcing. The migration routes and growth were tightly coupled: individuals located to the north of the Kuroshio axis experienced a better prey environment, showed a relatively higher growth rate, and entered a better prey field by self-selected swimming. Years with more high-growth individuals in the model corresponded to observed higher recruitment (R) and recruitment per spawner (RPS). These results support the hypothesis that a higher growth rate in the early stage results in higher recruitment, because individuals with higher growth can migrate into a better prey environment. A negative correlation was found between R and the distance of the Kuroshio axis from the Boso Peninsula, indicating that when the Kuroshio axis was located closer to the Boso Peninsula, the water temperature of the coastal area increased, resulting in an increase in coastal-dominant zooplankton species, which positively affected the growth of chub mackerel in the early life stage. In addition, interannual variations in prey zooplankton species composition and the relative position of the Kuroshio to the spawning grounds partially influenced the early growth of chub mackerel. The results demonstrate the complex mechanisms of ocean currents and prey fields controlling the recruitment of small pelagic species.","[Guo, Chenying; Xiu, Peng] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Ito, Shin-ichi] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Kamimura, Yasuhiro] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Fisheries Resources Inst, 2-12-4 Fukuura, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS; University of Tokyo; Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA)","Xiu, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, State Key Lab Trop Oceanog, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Ito, S (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan.","goito@aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp; pxiu@scsio.ac.cn","Xiu, Peng/O-6724-2014; Ito, Shin-ichi/E-2981-2012","Xiu, Peng/0000-0001-5328-8405; Ito, Shin-ichi/0000-0002-3635-2580; Guo, Chenying/0000-0001-8111-4883","KAKENHI [JP15H05823, JP18H0395, JP21H04735]; Japan Fisheries Research and Education Agency; Fisheries Agency of Japan; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2021M703294]","KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Japan Fisheries Research and Education Agency; Fisheries Agency of Japan; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation)","This study was supported by KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas) Grant Numbers JP15H05823 (OMIX project), JP18H0395, and JP21H04735 and funded by the Japan Fisheries Research and Education Agency and the Fisheries Agency of Japan.

On the other hand, since growth of plants is affected by surrounding climates, it is expected that real-time monitoring of crop plants growing makes possible quantitative agricultural management. This study proposed methods in measuring tree growth using hetero-core optical fiber sensors which are suitable for long-term, remote and real-time monitoring in wide area due to their features such as independence from temperature fluctuation and weather condition in addition to advantages of an optical fiber. Two types of sensors were used for that purpose. One of them was a dendrometer which measured radial changes of a tree stem and the other was elastic sensor which was to measure growth of smaller tree such as crop plant. In our experiment, it was demonstrated that the dendrometer was capable of measuring the differences of tree growing trend in period of different seasons such as growing rates 2.08 mm between spring and summer and 0.21 mm between autumn and winter, respectively. Additionally, this study had proposed the method of measuring crop plant growing by the elastic sensor because of its compact and light design and monotonious changes in optical loss to the amount of expansion and contraction.","[Uchida, Hoshito; Akita, Shohei; Nishiyama, Michiko; Watanabe, Kazuhiro] Soka Univ, Dept Informat Engn, Tokyo, Japan; [Nishiyama, Michiko] Soka Univ, Dept Environm Engn Symbiosis, Tokyo, Japan","Soka University; Soka University","Uchida, H (corresponding author), Soka Univ, Dept Informat Engn, Tokyo, Japan.","","Nishiyama, Michiko/ABB-4359-2021","Nishiyama, Michiko/0000-0002-5672-0555","Collaboration with Local Communities Project for Private Universities on Development of ubiquitous-Monitoring-Network Based on Distributed Sensor Nodes using Local Positioning / Optical Sensory Nerves and their Industrial Applications; MEXT (The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan)","Collaboration with Local Communities Project for Private Universities on Development of ubiquitous-Monitoring-Network Based on Distributed Sensor Nodes using Local Positioning / Optical Sensory Nerves and their Industrial Applications; MEXT (The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","This research was partly supported by Collaboration with Local Communities Project for Private Universities on Development of ubiquitous-Monitoring-Network Based on Distributed Sensor Nodes using Local Positioning / Optical Sensory Nerves and their Industrial Applications: matching fund subsidy from MEXT (The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan), 2006-2010.",NA,"6","0","0","0","5","SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING","BELLINGHAM","1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA","0277-786X","1996-756X","978-0-81948-543-4","PROC SPIE","","","2011","7981","","",NA,"",NA,"","","79812Z","10.1117/12.880388","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.880388","","","8","Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Engineering; Optics","BWP70",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000294447800087","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Wealso examined the importance of rockpool physical characteristics (e.g. shore height, surface, volume and depth) on the physico-chemical variability. Rockpool shore height and depth appeared as the main physical factors driving physico-chemical variations. Shallow upper shore rockpools exhibited the largest diurnal and seasonal fluctuations of temperature, oxygen concentration and pH(T). Conversely, deeper and lower shore rockpools experienced weaker variations, excepted for salinity and nutrient concentrations. The physico-chemical environment was likely to be strongly influenced by rockpool community composition, especially in summer when rockpools were colonized by dense canopy-forming algae. During the day-time emersion, photosynthesis increased oxygen concentration and pH(T)but decreased nutrient concentrations in upper shore rockpools. The increase in rockpool pH(T) provided an alkaline environment conducive to coralline algal calcification. Conversely, at night, upper shore rockpools presented a strong decrease in oxygen concentration and pH(T) due to the high community respiration, increasing the dissolution in coralline algae. Therefore, rockpools are characterized by complex interactions between physical and chemical parameters and biological processes. Rockpools appear as suitable environments to examine the physiological processes set up by species to face natural variability, especially in a context of climate change. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Bioenergetic parameters were measured during the course of 1 year. The results showed (i) a very strong influence of food moisture on the bioenergetic parameters of A. rubra, (ii) the influence of temperature depends on whether it is fluctuating or constant, (iii) opposite mechanisms regulate growth in a shortage of water and at a suboptimal temperature: in the former case, consumption does not change while the metabolic rate decreases, and at a suboptimal temperature the metabolic rate is dictated by temperature and the consumption rate is altered and (iv) a nitrogen-rich diet results in a decreased metabolic rate, suggesting the existence of energetically costly adaptations to low quality wood as a food source.

Many pesticides are indeed more toxic at higher mean temperatures. Yet, we know next to nothing about the effect of another key component of climate change, the increase of daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs), on pesticide toxicity. Therefore, we tested the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos under different levels of DTF (constant = 0 degrees C, low = 5 degrees C (current maximum level) and high = 10 degrees C (predicted maximum level under global warming)) around the same mean temperature on key life history and physiological traits of Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae in a common-garden experiment. At all levels of DTF, chlorpyrifos exposure was stressful: it reduced energy storage (fat content) and the activity of its target enzyme acetylcholinesterase, while it increased the activity of the detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. Notably, chlorpyrifos did not cause mortality or reduced growth rate at the constant temperature (0 degrees C DTF), yet increased mortality 6x and reduced growth rate with ca. 115% in the presence of DTF. This indicates that daily short-term exposures to higher temperatures can increase pesticide toxicity. Our data suggest that when 5 degrees C DTF will become more common in the studied high-latitude populations, this will increase the toxicity of CPF, and that a further increase from 5 degrees DTF to 10 degrees C DTF may not result in a further increase of pesticide toxicity. Our results highlight the biological importance of including daily temperature fluctuations in ecological risk assessment of pesticides and as an extra dimension in the climate-induced toxicant sensitivity concept.

Mungbean yield is highly variable due to fluctuating temperature and unpredictable rainfall. Aims. To improve yield stability, it is critical to utilise a model that can simulate mungbean phenology, biomass, and yield accurately. Methods. A thorough understanding of the physiological determinants of growth and yield is required to advance existing mungbean crop modelling capability. Currently, there is limited understanding of the physiological determinants of canopy and reproductive development and their variation in mungbean germplasm. Two experiments (controlled and field environments) were conducted at Gatton, Queensland, in 2018-19. Six Australian mungbean genotypes and one black gram (Vigna mungo L.) were grown under non-limiting conditions. Plant phenotypic traits (canopy development, time to first, 50% flowering, duration of flowering and podding, flower appearance, pod addition rates) were recorded. key results. Genotypes M10403 and Satin 11 had significantly higher leaf appearance rate (LAR). Genotypes with a greater LAR had higher number of leaves but lower individual leaf area. Genotypes varied significantly in time to first and 50% flowering, with Onyx-AU (black gram) and Celera II-AU flowering earliest. Flowering and podding rates, and duration of these phenological phases varied among genotypes. Total plant leaf area (TPLA) approached its maximum at mid-podding stage. Implications. This study quantified the key phenotypic and physiological relationships associated with canopy and reproductive development, critical for the improvement of mungbean crop modelling required to accurately simulate growth and development and inform possible canopy constraints that are limiting mungbean productivity.","[Geetika, Geetika; Smith, Millicent; Rachaputi, Rao C.

The net photosynthetic rates (A) of Chinese cabbage and radish were depressed at temperatures above approximately 25A degrees C (corresponding to the optimum temperature for photosynthesis), due in part to high rates of respiration above 25 or 30A degrees C. Chinese cabbage was more sensitive to high temperature than radish. Above 25A degrees C, stomatal conductance (g (s)) declined steeply with a sharp increase in the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and transpiration rate (E), suggesting that stomatal closure could not be associated with transpiration rate, particularly in Chinese cabbage. Dramatic declines in water use efficiency (WUE), instantaneous transpiration efficiency (ITE), and carboxylation efficiency (CE) above 30A degrees C indicated that the plants could be severely affected negatively by high temperatures above 30A degrees C. However, compared to Chinese cabbage, radish had high light use efficiency and potential to assimilate CO2, judged by their high quantum yield (phi) and maximum photosynthetic rate (A (max)). Radish utilized high levels of photosynthetic photon flux and strongly acclimated to the light environment, considering their high light saturation point (Q (sat)) and low light compensation point (Q (comp)). These results suggested that rising temperature might substantially alter water availability of plants by itself and/or through effects on the rate of water loss from leaves of Chinese cabbage and radish under diurnal and/or seasonal fluctuations of temperature, and/or global temperature change. To maintain the high productivity and quality of these crop species, it may be necessary to harvest them until early June, when the daily maximum temperature is below 25A degrees C in Jeju Island.","[Oh, Soonja; Moon, Kyung Hwan; Song, Eun Young; Son, In-Chang] Rural Dev Adm, Agr Res Inst Climate Change, Jeju 690150, South Korea; [Koh, Seok Chan] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Jeju 690756, South Korea; [Koh, Seok Chan] Jeju Natl Univ, Res Inst Basic Sci, Jeju 690756, South Korea","Rural Development Administration (RDA); Jeju National University; Jeju National University","Koh, SC (corresponding author), Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Jeju 690756, South Korea.","sckoh@jejunu.ac.kr","","","Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea [PJ009870062014]","Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea(Rural Development Administration (RDA), Republic of Korea)","This work was carried out with the support of 'Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science & Technology Development (Development of prototypes of crop models for yield estimation of main vegetable crops, PJ009870062014)', Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.",NA,"27","24","24","2","40","KOREAN SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE","JEOLLABUK-DO","C/O NATL INST HORTICULTURAL & HERBAL SCIENCE, 100, NONGSAENGMYEONG-RO, ISEO-MYEON, WANJU-GUN, JEOLLABUK-DO, 565-852, SOUTH KOREA","2211-3452","2211-3460","","HORTIC ENVIRON BIOTE","Hortic.

We evaluated abundance dynamics of five common species of diurnal lizards over 25 years in a Sonoran Desert transition zone where precipitation decreased and temperature increased across time, and assessed hypotheses for the influence of climatic flux on spatiotemporal variation in abundances. We repeatedly surveyed lizards in spring and summer of each year at up to 32 sites, and used hierarchical mixture models to estimate detection probabilities, abundances, and population growth rates. Among terrestrial species, abundances of a short-lived, winter-spring breeder increased markedly by an estimated 237%-285% across time, while two larger spring-summer breeders with higher thermal preferences declined by up to 64%. Abundances of two arboreal species that occupy shaded and thus sheltered microhabitats fluctuated but did not decline systematically. Abundances of all species increased with precipitation at short lag times (1-1.5 years) likely due to enhanced food availability, but often declined after periods of high precipitation at longer lag times (2-4 years) likely due to predation and other biotic pressures. Although rising maximum daily temperatures (T-max) are expected to drive global declines of lizards, associations with T-max were variable and weak for most species. Instead, abundances of all species declined with rising daily minimum temperatures, suggesting degradation of cool refugia imposed widespread metabolic or other costs. Our results suggest climate warming and drying are having major impacts on lizard communities by driving declines in species with traits that augment exposure to abiotic extremes and by modifying species interactions. The complexity of patterns we report indicates that evaluating and responding to the influence of climate change on biodiversity must consider a broad array of ecological processes.","[Flesch, Aaron D.] Univ Arizona, Desert Lab, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Rosen, Philip C.] Univ Arizona, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ USA; [Holm, Peter] Natl Pk Serv, Organ Pipe Cactus Natl Monument, Ajo, AZ USA","University of Arizona; University of Arizona; United States Department of the Interior","Flesch, AD (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Desert Lab, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.","flesch@email.arizona.edu","","Flesch, Aaron/0000-0003-3434-0778","U.S. National Park Service (NPS)","U.S. National Park Service (NPS)","We thank the U.S. National Park Service (NPS) for support and for developing monitoring in OPCNM, especially superintendents H.Smith and B.

The relationship between temperature and the rate of development of mildew colonies within the incubation period under constant temperature was described by two alternative non-linear models (exponential and thermodynamic). The resulting curves were asymmetrically bell-shaped with an optimum temperature of c. 23 degrees C. The two constant-temperature models predicted the development of powdery mildew under fluctuating temperatures with similar accuracy, even though the exponential model fitted the constant temperature data less well than the thermodynamic model. The thermodynamic model failed to fit the fluctuating-temperature data directly, whereas the exponential model fitted those data directly and the fit was similar to the corresponding model from the constant-temperature data.

To study the effect of changing temperature and moisture condition on pre-emergent growth of potato seed tubers having different physiological age, a range of different temperature and moisture conditions were applied. Three temperatures (10, 15 and 20 degrees C) and three water potentials [wet (-0.02 MPa), dry (-0.6 MPa) and fluctuated between wet and dry] were set to two lots of cv Russet Burbank and Atlantic seed tubers that had been treated with storage temperature of 15 degrees C before planting to established aging. All possible combinations of seed tuber physiological age, cultivar and moisture treatments were randomized in each temperature level with 25 replications of each. Significant interactions (p<0.05) were found between cultivar, temperature, soil moisture in affecting the duration of the lag phase. A decrease in water potential at 10 degrees C from -0.02 MPa to -0.6 MPa extended the lag phase for cv Atlantic from 20 days to 23 days. Increasing the water potential from -0.6 to -0.02 MPa shortened the lag phase of younger tuber of cv Atlantic but lengthened the lag phase duration for older tuber. A weak interactions were found between cultivar, temperature and moisture (p<0.05) on the rate of linear elongation. In the case of Russet Burbank, linear elongation rate decreased with increasing water potential at 20 degrees C only. In contrast, for Atlantic, elongation rate increased from 2 mm/day to 4.5 mm/day with increase in water potential from -0.6 MPa to -0.02 MPa at 20 degrees C.","[Ridwan, I.; Padjung, R.] Hasanuddin Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Laboratorium Agroclimatol, Makassar 90245, South Sulawesi, Indonesia; [Lisson, S.] Univ Tasmania, Sch Agr Sci, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia; [Brown, P.] Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Med & Appl Sci, Bundaberg, Qld 4670, Australia","Universitas Hasanuddin; University of Tasmania; Central Queensland University","Ridwan, I (corresponding author), Hasanuddin Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Laboratorium Agroclimatol, Makassar 90245, South Sulawesi, Indonesia.","ifayanti@unhas.ac.id","Ridwan, Ifayanti/GQR-1222-2022","Ridwan, Ifayanti/0000-0001-9528-3151","Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)","Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR)(Australian Ctr Intl Agr Res)","I thank the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) for the funding this research under John Allwright Fellowship.",NA,"20","0","0","0","3","IOP PUBLISHING LTD","BRISTOL","DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND","1755-1307","","","IOP C SER EARTH ENV","IOP Conf.

Our results suggest that the chlorophyte and the two diatoms have different tolerance to fluctuations in salinity and pH. The two species of diatoms exhibited maximum growth rates at a salinity of 33, and growth rates at a salinity of 100 were reduced by 50% compared to at a salinity of 33. Growth ceased at a salinity of 150. The chlorophyte species was more sensitive to high salinities than the two diatom species. Growth rate of the chlorophyte was greatly reduced already at a salinity of 50 and it could not grow at salinities above 100. At salinity 33 and constant TCO2 concentration, all species exhibited maximal growth rate at pH 8.0 and/or 8.5. The two diatom species stopped growing at pH > 9.5, while the chlorophyte species still was able to grow at a rate which was 1/3 of its maximum growth rate at pH 10. Thus, Chlamydomonas sp. was able to grow at high pH levels in the succession experiment and therefore outcompeted the two diatom species. Complementary experiments indicated that growth was mainly limited by pH, while inorganic carbon limitation only played an important role at very high pH levels and low TCO2 concentrations.","[Sogaard, Dorte Haubjerg; Rysgaard, Soren; Glud, Ronnie Nohr] Greenland Inst Nat Resources, Greenland Climate Res Ctr, Nuuk 3900, Greenland; [Hansen, Per Juel] Univ Copenhagen, Marine Biol Lab, DK-3000 Helsingor, Denmark; [Sogaard, Dorte Haubjerg; Glud, Ronnie Nohr] Univ So Denmark, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark; Scottish Assoc Marine Sci, Dumstaffnage Marine Lab, Dunbeg PA37 1QA, Scotland","Greenland Institute of Natural Resources; University of Copenhagen; University of Southern Denmark","Sogaard, DH (corresponding author), Greenland Inst Nat Resources, Greenland Climate Res Ctr, Kivioq 2,Box 570, Nuuk 3900, Greenland.","doso@natur.gl","Hansen, Per Juel/AAX-6193-2020; Rysgaard, Søren/K-6689-2013; Hansen, Per/E-9969-2011","Hansen, Per Juel/0000-0003-0228-9621; Hansen, Per/0000-0003-0228-9621; Rysgaard, Soren/0000-0003-1726-2958; Glud, Ronnie N./0000-0002-7069-893X","Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation; Greenland Climate Research Centre (GCRC) [6507]; KVUK Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland","Danish Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation; Greenland Climate Research Centre (GCRC)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)); KVUK Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland","We thank Anna Haxen and Michael R.

In this scenario, understanding wild plant adaptations in extreme ecosystems offers an opportunity to learn about new mechanisms for resilience. Previous studies have shown species specificity for metabolites involved in plant adaptation to harsh environments. Here, we combined multispecies ecological metabolomics and machine learning-based generalized linear model predictions to link the metabolome to the plant environment in a set of 24 species belonging to 14 families growing along an altitudinal gradient in the Atacama Desert. Thirty-nine common compounds predicted the plant environment with 79% accuracy, thus establishing the plant metabolome as an excellent integrative predictor of environmental fluctuations. These metabolites were independent of the species and validated both statistically and biologically using an independent dataset from a different sampling year. Thereafter, using multiblock predictive regressions, metabolites were linked to climatic and edaphic stressors such as freezing temperature, water deficit and high solar irradiance. These findings indicate that plants from different evolutionary trajectories use a generic metabolic toolkit to face extreme environments. These core metabolites, also present in agronomic species, provide a unique metabolic goldmine for improving crop performances under abiotic pressure.","[Dussarrat, Thomas; Diaz, Francisca P.; Gutierrez, Rodrigo A.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Genet Mol & Microbiol, FONDAP Ctr Genome Regulat, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 340, Santiago, Chile; [Dussarrat, Thomas; Prigent, Sylvain; Bernillon, Stephane; Flandin, Amelie; Cassan, Cedric; Jacob, Daniel; Gibon, Yves; Rolin, Dominique; Petriacq, Pierre] Univ Bordeaux, INRAE, UMR1332, BFP, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France; [Prigent, Sylvain; Bernillon, Stephane; Flandin, Amelie; Cassan, Cedric; Van Delft, Pierre; Jacob, Daniel; Gibon, Yves; Rolin, Dominique; Petriacq, Pierre] Bordeaux Metabolome, MetaboHUB, PHENOME EMPHASIS, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France; [Latorre, Claudio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ecol, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 340, Santiago, Chile; [Latorre, Claudio] Inst Ecol & Biodivers IEB, 3425 Nunoa, Santiago, Chile; [Van Delft, Pierre; Joubes, Jerome] Univ Bordeaux, CNRS, Lab Biogenese Membranaire, UMR 5200, Villenave Dornon, France; [Varala, Kranthi] Purdue Univ, Dept Hort & Landscape Architecture, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Varala, Kranthi] Purdue Univ, Ctr Plant Biol, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Biology (INSB); UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus","Gutierrez, RA (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Genet Mol & Microbiol, FONDAP Ctr Genome Regulat, Av Libertador Bernardo OHiggins 340, Santiago, Chile.;Petriacq, P (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, INRAE, UMR1332, BFP, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France.;Petriacq, P (corresponding author), Bordeaux Metabolome, MetaboHUB, PHENOME EMPHASIS, F-33140 Villenave Dornon, France.","rgutierrez@bio.puc.cl; pierre.petriacq@inrae.fr","Prigent, Sylvain/HHS-5270-2022; Varala, Kranthi/AHD-3960-2022; Latorre, Claudio/E-6805-2012; Pétriacq, Pierre/AAQ-7391-2020","Varala, Kranthi/0000-0003-1051-6636; Latorre, Claudio/0000-0003-4708-7599; Pétriacq, Pierre/0000-0001-8151-7420; Van Delft, Pierre/0000-0001-5839-8427; Dussarrat, Thomas/0000-0001-6245-3652; Cassan, Cedric/0000-0003-3022-4278; Jacob, Daniel/0000-0002-6687-7169; Prigent, Sylvain/0000-0001-5146-0347; Diaz, Francisca P/0000-0002-1100-7801","MetaboHUB [ANR-11-INBS-0010]; PHENOME [ANR-11-INBS-0012]; European Commission's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program via the GLOMICAVE project [952908]; Fondo de Desarrollo de A reas Prioritarias (FONDAP) Center for Genome Regulation [15200002]; Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [FONDECYT 1180759]; DOI EVONET Proyect; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program [iBio ICN17_022]","MetaboHUB; PHENOME; European Commission's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program via the GLOMICAVE project; Fondo de Desarrollo de A reas Prioritarias (FONDAP) Center for Genome Regulation(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDAP); Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); DOI EVONET Proyect; ANID-Millennium Science Initiative Program","We acknowledge the GenOuest bioinformatics core facility (https://www.genouest.org) and the Genotoul bioinformatics platform Toulouse Occitanie (Bioinfo Genotoul, https://doi.org/10.15454/1.5572369328961167E12) for providing computing infrastructures and resources.

Historical data from 1961-2000 indicate these temperature fluctuations may seriously affect grain yield of winter wheat crops. In this study, a field air temperature control system (FATC) was used to simulate the winter warming, spring cold and freezing events in the field experiment in 2010-2011 to explore their impacts on growth and yield of winter wheat. Eight elite wheat varieties released during 1961-2000 were included and four temperature scenarios were applied, including late spring freeze alone, winter warming + late spring freeze, early spring cold + late spring freeze and the normal temperature condition as control. Winter warming combined with late spring freeze significantly decreased tiller survival rate, leaf photosynthetic rate and leaf growth in wheat plants, and reduced the spike number and kernel number per spike, and the final grain yield. In contrast, the wheat plants experienced early spring cold had higher tiller survival rate, leaf photosynthetic capacity and sugar accumulation and improved tolerance to the late spring freeze, resulting in less yield loss, as compared with those without experiencing early spring cold. Both the meta-analyses and the field experimental data demonstrated that the effects of later spring freeze stress on wheat yield were exacerbated by winter warming but were extenuated by early spring cold events. Therefore, it is important to consider the characteristics of temperature fluctuations during winter to spring for precise evaluation of climate change effects on wheat production.","[Li, X.; Cai, J.; Dai, T.; Cao, W.; Jiang, D.] Nanjing Agr Univ, Natl Engn & Technol Ctr Informat Agr, Key Lab Crop Physiol & Ecol Southern China, Minist Agr, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, X.; Liu, F.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Fac Sci, Taastrup, Denmark","Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Copenhagen","Jiang, D (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Natl Engn & Technol Ctr Informat Agr, Key Lab Crop Physiol & Ecol Southern China, Minist Agr, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","jiangd@njau.edu.cn","Liu, Fulai/D-8357-2013; Li, Xiangnan/I-2365-2014; Li, Xiangnan/J-6857-2015; Jiang, Dong/C-4047-2008; Li, Xiangnan/J-3861-2019","Liu, Fulai/0000-0002-5006-8965; Li, Xiangnan/0000-0003-0417-9151; Li, Xiangnan/0000-0003-0417-9151; Jiang, Dong/0000-0003-0876-5043; ","PAPD; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31325020, 31028017, 31000686, 31171484]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education [20120097110026]; China Agriculture Research System [CARS-03]","PAPD; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP)); China Agriculture Research System","This study is supported by projects of PAPD, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31325020, 31028017, 31000686, 31171484), the Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (20120097110026) and the China Agriculture Research System (CARS-03).",NA,"41","27","30","2","122","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0931-2250","1439-037X","","J AGRON CROP SCI","J.

We examined developmental stability in mountain birch Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii along a strong pollution gradient in the Kola Peninsula, north-western Russia, over a period of 8 years (1993-2000). In particular, we investigated whether climatic factors or aerial pollution could increase developmental instability, which was assessed through leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA). 2. Contrary to our expectations, leaf FA was not correlated with either distance from the pollution source, or with the levels of nickel and sulphur dioxide pollution in the study plots, or with shoot length or leaf size. There was, however, variation in FA between years: highest values of developmental instability were recorded during the coldest summers. 3. There was also considerable among-tree variation in FA within plots, suggesting that birch genets either responded differently to environmental stress or demonstrated a different degree of genetic stress. The significant interaction between study year and birch genet suggests that the detected variation was a consequence of different sensitivity of the trees to climatic fluctuations rather than of different sensitivity to pollution. 4. Growth rate of birch correlated positively with developmental stability, i.e. faster leaf growth was associated with lower FA both at the scale of individual trees (presumably genetic differences) and at the scale of study years (environmental differences). 5. The lack of detectable response to aerial pollution by mountain birch in this study may be an outcome of selection for pollution-resistant genotypes, which may have occurred due to an exceptionally high emission pressure during the past decades. On the other hand, resistance to temperature variations may not have evolved because warm and cold periods appear to occur somewhat regularly in the Kola Peninsula, and therefore variation in temperature optima between genotypes is favoured by natural selection. 6. Our results demonstrate that FA may serve as a useful measure of climatic stress in plants.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland","University of Turku","Valkama, J (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Sect Ecol, FIN-20014 Turku, Finland.","jarival@utu.fi","Kozlov, Mikhail V./I-5037-2013","Kozlov, Mikhail V./0000-0002-9500-4244","","","",NA,"56","60","66","0","8","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-8901","1365-2664","","J APPL ECOL","J.

The degree of fatigue damage is evaluated by cumulative usage factor using design fatigue curve, which is determined from results of uniaxial fatigue tests. The stress caused by thermal transients is generally equi-biaxial, not uniaxial. Fluid temperature fluctuation due to changes in plant conditions, such as plant start-up and shutdown, is the primary cause of fatigue damage. For accurate fatigue damage evaluation, it is important to be conducted under equi-biaxial condition. In this study, pressurized disc fatigue test was conducted in order to simulate the cyclic equi-biaxial stress. In order to clarify how the crack initiates and grows under the equi-biaxial stress condition. Cracking behavior was examined by replica observation method. The crack growth rates were identified by the change in the crack length. It was shown that the fatigue crack growth rate under equi-biaxial stress was faster than that under uniaxial stress for the same equivalent stress intensify factor. It was concluded that the reduction in the fatigue life under equi-biaxial stress was brought about by the accelerated crack growth.","[Iida, Satohi; Abe, Shigeki; Nakamura, Takao] Osaka Univ, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Kamaya, Masayuki] Inst Nucl Safety Syst Inc, Mikata, Fukui 9191205, Japan","Osaka University; Institute of Nuclear Safety System, Inc.

However, the use of seaweed extracts for their beneficial properties, as applied to marine macroalgae, only began in the mid to late 2000s. Kappaphycus alvarezii is an important red seaweed on the coasts of tropical to sub-tropical waters, mainly because of the various applications of kappa carrageenan, which is the major industrial colloid extracted from this extensively cultivated biomass. Cultivation of this seaweed has brought economic benefits to tens of thousands of seaweed farmers in Southeast Asia and other minor producing countries. Recently, Ascophyllum (aka. Acadian) Marine Plant Extract Powder (AMPEP), a commercial seaweed extract from the brown intertidal, macroalga A. nodosum was used in steps taken during the micropropagation and field cultivation of K. alvarezii. The reasons for utilizing this treatment included addressing the current problems facing the industry, such as decreased productivity, loss of vigor and diminished crop quality. This was brought about by shortages in the availability of good quality propagules (seedlings) and also disease and endo-epiphyte infestations, which affected the ability to grow and harvest saleable biomass, thus decreasing the income, and therefore the interest and participation of the potential seaweed farmers (based on the factor of repetitive, drudge labor and their derived income per unit effort). This paper reviews studies on Kappaphycus including the use of AMPEP specifically and also some alternative extracts to mitigate both biotic and abiotic stressors, using examples from micropropagation, field cultivation, endophyte mitigation and impacts on the resulting carrageenan qualities. Taken together, this body of evidence provides proof of concept and very promising results which may lead to further studies more specifically to identify the modes of action and the metabolic pathways by which the complex AMPEP extract might improve stress tolerances in K. alvarezii in order to obtain higher productivity and enhanced quality characteristics (i.e., exposure to increasing surface seawater temperature, salinity fluctuations and photo-inhibitory irradiance as well as attacks by pathogenic and opportunistic organisms).","[Hurtado, Anicia Q.] Integrated Serv Dev Aquaculture & Fisheries ISDA, MacArthur Highway, Iloilo 5000, Philippines; [Critchley, Alan T.] Cape Breton Univ, Verschuren Ctr Sustainabil Energy & Environm, Sydney, NS B1P 6L2, Canada","Cape Breton University","Hurtado, AQ (corresponding author), Integrated Serv Dev Aquaculture & Fisheries ISDA, MacArthur Highway, Iloilo 5000, Philippines.","anicia.hurtado@gmail.com","Critchley, Alan/AAL-1706-2020; Critchley, Alan/AAB-1467-2019","Critchley, Alan/0000-0003-1704-458X; Critchley, Alan/0000-0003-1704-458X","","","",NA,"120","23","23","3","31","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0921-8971","1573-5176","","J APPL PHYCOL","J.

The fluid temperature fluctuations at the fluid-wall interface, caused by the turbulent mixing, induce stress fluctuations in the pipe, which may lead, in some circumstances, to fatigue and subsequent leakage. This paper estimates the probability of surface crack growth through the pipe wall under turbulent fluid mixing conditions using a damage tolerant approach. The growth rates of stipulated surface cracks are studied for diverse variations of fluid temperatures generated with an improved spectral loading approach recently developed by Jo2ef Stefan Institute. The analyses use a rather simple and linear one-dimensional model of the pipe and linear elastic fracture mechanics theory to compute the time-dependent stress intensity factors of the crack. The uncertainties of crack growth, which arise from the use of comparatively short fluid temperature histories to the expected fatigue life time of months or years, are moreover evaluated for diverse time lengths of the fluid temperature histories. The likelihood of crack arrest is finally discussed.","[Garrido, Oriol Costa; El Shawish, Samir; Cizelj, Leon] Jozef Stefan Inst, Reactor Engn Div, Jamova Cesta 39, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia","Slovenian Academy of Sciences & Arts (SASA); Jozef Stefan Institute","Garrido, OC (corresponding author), Jozef Stefan Inst, Reactor Engn Div, Jamova Cesta 39, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.","oriol.costa@ijs.si; samir.elshawish@ijs.si; leon.cizelj@ijs.si","Cizelj, Leon/A-3537-2008","Cizelj, Leon/0000-0002-8038-722X","Slovenian Research Agency [P2-0026]","Slovenian Research Agency(Slovenian Research Agency - Slovenia)","The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial contribution of the Slovenian Research Agency through the research program P2-0026.",NA,"28","1","1","0","1","NUCLEAR SOCIETY SLOVENIA","1001 LJUBLJANA","JAMOVA 39, 1001 LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA","","","978-961-6207-40-9","","","","2016",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"","","","","","","","12","Nuclear Science & Technology","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Nuclear Science & Technology","BH2RT",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000399192400035","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Under positive DIF, seedling height, internode length, and the ist leaf petiole length were longer than in plants grown under negative DIF. Although positive DIF tended to favor leaf elongation and leaf unfolding rate, in that the leaves during the rapid extension (13 days after treatment started) were always longer than those grown under negative DIF, no significant difference was observed in the final measurement. The elongation response to DIF alteration during the rapid elongation was reflected in plant height, internode length, and leaf petiole length in all plant species. After DIF was altered, a significant difference on the final length was observed between the corresponding treatments (i. e. between positive DIF and alteration from positive to negative DIF, and between negative DIF and alteration from negative to positive DIF treatment). The response to DIF alteration from negative to positive was greater than that from positive to negative. The elongation after DIF alteration was greater in seedlings which were smaller at the time of DIF alteration than in the larger seedlings; the former were under the negative DIF until the alteration while the latter were under the positive DIF. This result could be summarized that the DIF during early nursery stage had a small effect on the growth after the treatment.

However, light is highly heterogeneous in natural condition, and plants have to evolve a series of strategies to acclimate the dynamic light since it is sessile. The photosynthetic performance and regulatory mechanisms involved in acclimation were elucidated in shade-tolerant plant Amorphophallus xiei under steady state and fluctuating high light. The dissipation and allocation of light energy, photosynthetic capacity, and antioxidant defense were examined in A. xiei cultivated under 4%, 17%, and 100% of full sunlight. High-light-grown plants exhibited reduced photosynthesis and the slowest response to simulated sunflecks than the other two treatments. Maximum and actual efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F-v '/F-m ' and phi(PSII)) and electron transport rate (ETR) were lowest, and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) were highest in high-light-grown plants than in low- and intermediate-light-grown plants subjected to different photon flux densities (PFD) and intercellular CO2 concentrations (C-i). F-v '/F-m ', phi(PSII), ETR and NPQ were lowest in high-light-grown A. xiei than others, when plants were exposed to simulated sunflecks. In fully light-induced leaves, high-light-grown plants showed a maximum value in quantum efficiency of light-dependent thermal dissipation (phi(NPQ)), and a minimum value in phi(PSII) was recorded. Low-light-grown plants subjected to simulated sunflecks, a maximum value in phi(NPQ) and phi(PSII) were observed. Mass-based nitrogen content (N-area), specific leaf area (SLA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities significantly declined with the increase of growth irradiance. The high-light-grown plants showed higher xanthophyll de-epoxidation and ascorbate-glutathione cycle activity, while low-light-grown plants showed higher neoxanthin and beta-carotene contents. In general, high-light-grown A. xiei generally show a depressed photosynthetic capacity, and are efficient in dissipating excess light energy by NPQ under a steady-state light but not under a highly fluctuating light. Low-light-grown plants show a rapid photosynthetic assimilation response to sunflecks and then a rapid activation of the energy-dependent quenching (qE) component of NPQ under the sunflecks. In addition, high-light-grown plants, although using various strategies to reduce light absorption and to scavenge reactive oxygen species, have less efficient protection against photodamage.","[Zhang, Jinyan; Yan, Suo; Chen, Junwen] Yunnan Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Biotechnol, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jinyan; Yan, Suo; Chen, Junwen] Yunnan Agr Univ, Key Lab Med Plant Biol Yunnan Prov, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jinyan; Xie, Shiqing; Yan, Suo; Chen, Junwen] Yunnan Agr Univ, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr Germplasm Innovat, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Wenguo] Extens Ctr Agr Technol Dehong State, Mangshi 67840, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Yunnan Agricultural University; Yunnan Agricultural University; Yunnan Agricultural University","Chen, JW (corresponding author), Yunnan Agr Univ, Coll Agron & Biotechnol, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Chen, JW (corresponding author), Yunnan Agr Univ, Key Lab Med Plant Biol Yunnan Prov, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Chen, JW (corresponding author), Yunnan Agr Univ, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr Germplasm Innovat, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.;Xu, WG (corresponding author), Extens Ctr Agr Technol Dehong State, Mangshi 67840, Yunnan, Peoples R China.","wenguonote@163.com; cjw31412@hotmail.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31160392]; Project of Young and Middle-Aged Talent of Yunnan Province [2019HB093]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Project of Young and Middle-Aged Talent of Yunnan Province","The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31160392) and the Project of Young and Middle-Aged Talent of Yunnan Province (2019HB093).",NA,"83","2","2","6","19","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0137-5881","1861-1664","","ACTA PHYSIOL PLANT","Acta Physiol.

This study of red maple (Acer rubrum L.) characterizes photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency in planted cultivars relative to wildtype trees. Red maple is common in cities, yet there is little understanding of how physiological processes affect the long-term growth, condition, and ecosystem services provided by urban trees. In the first year of our study, we measured leaf-level gas exchange and performed short-term temperature curves on urban planted cultivars and on suburban and rural wildtype trees. In the second year, we compared urban planted cultivars and urban wildtype trees. In the first year, urban planted trees had higher maximum rates of photosynthesis and higher overall rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance throughout the summer, relative to suburban or rural wildtype trees. Urban planted trees again had higher maximum rates of photosynthesis in the second year. However, urban wildtype trees had higher water use efficiency as air temperatures increased and similar overall rates of photosynthesis, relative to cultivars, in mid and late summer. Our results show that physiological differences between cultivars and wildtype trees may relate to differences in their genetic background and their responses to local environmental conditions, contingent on the identity of the horticultural variety. Overall, our results suggest that wildtype trees should be considered for some urban locations, and our study is valuable in demonstrating how site type and tree type can inform tree planting strategies and improve long-term urban forest sustainability.","[Lahr, Eleanor C.; Frank, Steven D.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Lahr, Eleanor C.; Dunn, Robert R.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA","North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University","Lahr, EC (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.;Lahr, EC (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.","eclahr@ncsu.edu","Bell, E/M-9188-2018","Bell, E/0000-0003-4896-3327; Dunn, Robert/0000-0002-6030-4837","United States Geological Survey [G11AC20471, G13AC00405, G15AP00153]; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture [2013-02476]","United States Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA))","This project was supported by Cooperative Agreement No. G11AC20471, G13AC00405 and G15AP00153 from the United States Geological Survey.

However, another possible cause that has been overlooked is the daily dynamics of the water status in the living stem tissues and its influence on stem growth rate and thus respiration. The objective of this study was to assess the daily dynamics of stem water status and growth rate and to determine the extent to which they may be linked to daily variations in stem F-CO2. Methods F-CO2 of young beech and oak stems were measured under controlled conditions. Relative stem turgor pressure (Psi(p)), obtained from simulations with the 'RCGro' model, was used as an indicator of the water status in the living stem tissues. Daily dynamics of stem growth were derived from Psi p: growth was assumed to occur when Psi(p) exceeded a relative threshold value. Key Results There was a strong correspondence between fluctuations in F-CO2 and simulated Psi(p). The non-growth conditions during daytime coincided with depressions in F-CO2, Moreover, F-CO2 responded to changes in T, in the absence of growth, indicating also that maintenance processes were influenced by the water status in the living stem tissues. Conclusions Daytime depressions in stem F-CO2 correlate with the daily dynamics of turgor, as a measure of the water status in the living stem tissues: it is suggested that water status of tree stems is a potentially important determinant of stem F-CO2, as it influences the rate of growth and maintenance processes in the living tissues of the stem.","Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Ghent University","Saveyn, A (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","an.saveyn@UGent.be","","Steppe, Kathy/0000-0001-6252-0704","","","",NA,"41","51","56","3","18","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0305-7364","1095-8290","","ANN BOT-LONDON","Ann.

However, it is currently still very difficult to capture these responses at the field scale for phenotyping purposes. Advanced hyperspectral imaging tools are increasingly used in phenotyping, and have been applied to detect changes in plants in response to a specific treatment, phenological state or monitor its growth and development. Phenotyping has to evolve towards capturing dynamic behaviour under more subtle fluctuations in environmental conditions, without the presence of clear treatments or stresses. Therefore, we investigated the potential of hyperspectral imaging to capture dynamic behaviour of plants in stress-free conditions at a temporal resolution of seconds. Two growth chamber experiments were set up, in which strawberry plants and four different background materials, serving as controls, were monitored by a snapshot hyperspectral camera in variable conditions of light, temperature and relative humidity. The sampling period was set to three seconds, triggering image acquisition and gas exchange measurements. Different background materials were used to assess the influence of the environment and the camera in both experiments. To separate the plant and background data, static masks were determined. Two datasets were created, which encompass both experiments. One dataset was constructed after averaging over the entire mask to acquire one value per spectral band. These values were then used to calculate a set of vegetation indices. The other dataset used spatial subsampling to retain spatial information. From both datasets, linear models were constructed using ridge regression, which estimated the measured eco-physiological and environmental data. Leaf temperature and vapour pressure deficit based on leaf temperature are the two main eco-physiological characteristics that could be predicted successfully. Stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration rate show less promising results. We suspect that limited variation, and low spectral resolution and range are the main causes of the inability of the models to extract meaningful predictions. Furthermore, the models that were only trained on background data also showed good predictive performance. This is probably because the main drivers for good performing eco-physiological variables are temperature and incident light intensity. Environmental characteristics that have good performance are photosynthetically active radiation and air temperature. Current hyperspectral sensing technologies are not yet able to uncover most plant dynamic eco-physiological responses when plants are cultivated in stress-free conditions.","[Pieters, Olivier; wyffels, Francis] Univ Ghent, IMEC, AIRO, IDLab, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 126, B-9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium; [Pieters, Olivier; De Swaef, Tom; Lootens, Peter; Roldan-Ruiz, Isabel] Flanders Res Inst Agr Fisheries & Food, Plant Sci Unit, Caritasstr 39, B-9090 Melle, Belgium; [Stock, Michiel] Univ Ghent, KERMIT, Dept Data Anal & Math Modelling, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Roldan-Ruiz, Isabel] Univ Ghent, Dept Plant Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 71, B-9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium","Ghent University; IMEC; Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research; Ghent University; Ghent University","Pieters, O (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, IMEC, AIRO, IDLab, Technol Pk Zwijnaarde 126, B-9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium.","olivier.pieters@ugent.be; tom.deswaef@ilvo.vlaanderen.be; peter.lootens@ilvo.vlaanderen.be; michiel.stock@ugent.be; isabel.roldan-ruiz@ilvo.vlaanderen.be; francis.wyffels@ugent.be","Pieters, Olivier/GVT-8505-2022; De Swaef, Tom/I-1272-2019; wyffels, Francis/HHT-0233-2022; Stock, Michiel/E-4947-2018","Pieters, Olivier/0000-0002-5473-4849; De Swaef, Tom/0000-0002-8338-7786; Stock, Michiel/0000-0003-0903-6061","Special Research Fund (B.O.F.) of Ghent University [BOF17/DOC/324]; Research Foundation - Flanders [FWO17/PDO/067]; Ghent University; FWO; Flemish Government - department EWI","Special Research Fund (B.O.F.) of Ghent University(Ghent University); Research Foundation - Flanders(FWO); Ghent University(Ghent University); FWO(FWO); Flemish Government - department EWI","Olivier Pieters received PhD funding by Special Research Fund (B.O.F.) of Ghent University [grant number BOF17/DOC/324].

Most importantly, the selected values are determined by human observation of the crop responses. Greenhouse tomatoes often show a pattern of cycling between reproductive and vegetative growth modes. The growth mode is a practical visual characterization of the source-sink relationships of the plants resulting from the greenhouse environment (aerial and root zone). Experienced greenhouse tomato growers assess the growth mode based on morphological observations, including quantitative (length, diameter, elongation rates) and qualitative (shape and color) features of the plant head, stems, flowers, trusses, and leaves. Data front greenhouse environments and crop records front an experimental production in Tucson, Arizona, and from a large-scale commercial operation in Marfa, Texas, were used for modeling the growth mode of tomato plants with fuzzy logic. Data from the commercial operation were used to model weekly fluctuations of harvest rate, fruit size, and fruit developing time with dynamic neural networks (NN). The NN models accurately predicted weekly and seasonal fluctuations of the fruit-related parameters, having coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.92, 0.76, and 0.88, respectively, for harvest rate, fruit fresh weight, and fruit developing time, when compared with a dataset used for independent validation. The fuzzy modeling of growth mode allowed discrimination of the reproductive and balanced growth modes in the experimental system, and modeling of the seasonal growth mode variation in the commercial application. Both modeling results might be applicable to commercial operations for making decisions on greenhouse climate control and overall crop management practices.","[Fitz-Rodriguez, E.] Univ Arizona, Controlled Environm Agr Ctr, Tucson, AZ 85716 USA; [Giacomelli, G.

Short-day treatment induced growth cessation, bud set and dormancy development, as well as initiation of cold acclimation and an increase in freezing tolerance. Subsequent low temperature and short days (12-h photoperiod) resulted in a significant increase in freezing tolerance, whereas bud dormancy was gradually released. The concentration of ABA increased in response to short days and then remained high, but ABA concentrations fluctuated irregularly when the dormant plants were subsequently exposed to low temperature during short days. Although there was a parallel development of freezing tolerance and bud dormancy in response to short days, subsequent exposure to low temperature had opposite effects on these processes, enhancing freezing tolerance and releasing dormancy. Compared with the southern ecotype, the northern ecotype was more responsive to short days and low temperature, exhibiting earlier initiation of cold acclimation, growth cessation and an increase in ABA concentrations in short days, and higher freezing tolerance, faster dormancy release and greater alteration in ABA concentrations when subsequently exposed to low temperature during short days. The rates and extent of the increases in ABA concentration may be related to increases in freezing tolerance and dormancy development during short days, whereas the extent of the fluctuations in ABA concentration may play an important role in enhancing freezing tolerance and releasing dormancy during a subsequent exposure to low temperature during short days.","Univ Helsinki, Viikki Ctr, Div Genet, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Finnish Forest Res Inst, FIN-01301 Vantaa, Finland; Univ Tromso, Dept Biol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway","University of Helsinki; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); UiT The Arctic University of Tromso","Li, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, POB 416, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.","licy@cib.ac.cn","Li, Chunyang/D-6254-2013","Li, Chunyang/0000-0003-2895-2786; Welling, Annikki/0000-0002-5273-3922","","","",NA,"42","25","25","1","17","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0829-318X","1758-4469","","TREE PHYSIOL","Tree Physiol.","DEC","2005","25","12","",NA,"",NA,"1563","1569","","10.1093/treephys/25.12.1563","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/25.12.1563","","","7","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","994GT","16137942","Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000234019900010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We investigated whether the effect occurs through modification of metabolic reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing processes and is thus in line with the rate of living-free radical theory of aging. We compared 6 biogeographically and climatically distinct populations of the extremely long-lived ocean quahog Arctica islandica for age-dependent differences in metabolic rates and antioxidant capacities (superoxide dismutase, catalase activity and total glutathione concentration). The temperature and salinity ranges covered by the sampling locations (Norwegian coast, White Sea, Iceland, Kattegat, Kiel Bay and German Bight) were 3.7 to 9.3 degrees C and 20 to 35 ppt. Bivalve shells were used as age recorders by counting annual growth bands. Maximum determined age in different populations varied between 29 and 192 yr. Extreme longevity observed in some North Atlantic A. islandica populations seems to be based on their very low lifetime mass-specific respiration, in combination with stable maintenance of antioxidant protection throughout life in mature specimens. While the antioxidant capacity was similar among all populations, the shorter-lived populations exhibited the highest metabolic rates and showed no metabolic response (Q(10)) when warmed to higher temperature. Low and fluctuating salinity in the Baltic may further exert stress, which enhances respiration rates and reduces longevity in the Baltic Sea population. The exceptionally long lifespan of A. islandica cannot be exclusively explained by a well-established antioxidant defense system, and the long lifespan of some populations may rather be a function of low ROS formation (low metabolic rate) and high damage repair/removal capacities.","[Basova, Larisa] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg 199178, Russia; [Begum, Salma] Khulna Univ, Environm Sci Discipline, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh; [Strahl, Julia; Brey, Thomas; Abele, Doris] Alfred Wegener Inst Polar & Marine Res, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Sukhotin, Alexey] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Zool, White Sea Biol Stn, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Philipp, Eva] Inst Clin Mol Biol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany","Saint Petersburg State University; Khulna University; Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Russian Academy of Sciences; Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences","Basova, L (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, 16 Line,29, St Petersburg 199178, Russia.","lbasova@hotmail.com","Basova, Larisa/B-8575-2011; Sukhotin, Alexey/H-4144-2013","Basova, Larisa/0000-0002-7883-8052; Sukhotin, Alexey/0000-0003-2626-5317; Abele, Doris/0000-0002-5766-5017; Brey, Thomas/0000-0002-6345-2851","DAAD [A/05/56588, A/07/72522, A/05/22368]; BMBF International Office [RUS-07/A11]; German Science foundation (DFG) [Ab124/10-1]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [10-04-00316]; Hanse Wissenschaftskolleg (Delmenhorst, Germany); DFG Cluster of Excellence 'The Future Ocean'","DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); BMBF International Office(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); German Science foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); Hanse Wissenschaftskolleg (Delmenhorst, Germany); DFG Cluster of Excellence 'The Future Ocean'","The authors thank the crews of the AWI and IfM-Geomar research vessels for dredging animals from the German Bight and Baltic Sea, L.

Elenkin to high and fluctuating PPFD was studied in continuous cultures with computer-controlled variable light regimes. The aim of the work was to provide a better understanding of species-specific acclimation to high PPFD (as encountered by cyanobacteria in surface waterblooms), and of suppression of the growth of colony-forming cyanobacteria during periods of prolonged mixing in lakes. The dynamics of a set of variables was followed during the light period, including pigment composition, maximum rate, efficiency and minimum quantum requirement of photosynthesis, PS II cross-sections, and fluorescence variables. Both the green alga and the cyanobacterium displayed strong photo-inhibition of photosynthesis in the sinusoidal light regime, which simulated a natural light regime in the absence of mixing. P-max, alpha, QR and the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence declined, and the number of inactive PS II centres and PS IIbeta centres increased towards midday. Introduction of oscillations in the diurnal light regime, simulating different intensities of wind-induced mixing in lakes, mitigated photo-inhibition. Microcystis showed a prompt non-photochemical quenching of fluorescence in all light regimes, even at low to moderate PPFD. The sustained presence of zeaxanthin in Microcystis possibly induced instant, thermal dissipation of excitation energy from the antenna. Microcystis also exhibited a more reluctant acclimation to fluctuating PPFD. Growth rate of Scenedesmus was higher in all light regimes. This implied that if (known) differences in loss processes were ignored, Scenedesmus would outcompete Microcystis in lakes. The results underlined the importance of buoyancy regulation in increasing the daily light dose of cyanobacteria (but at the same time preventing over-excitation), and ultimately in the success in Microcystis in stable lakes.","UNIV AMSTERDAM, MICROBIOL LAB, 1018 WS AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","University of Amsterdam","","","Ibelings, Bas W/B-4237-2011","Ibelings, Bas W/0000-0002-7213-7407","","","",NA,"92","106","107","2","47","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0028-646X","1469-8137","","NEW PHYTOL","New Phytol.","NOV","1994","128","3","",NA,"",NA,"407","424","","10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02987.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02987.x","","","18","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","PX913","33874577","Green Submitted","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1994PX91300004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Particular morphs are adapted to different windows of opportunity for germination in the seasonally fluctuating and heterogeneous salt-marsh environment. The possibility that plants derived from the two morphs may also differ physiologically has not been investigated previously. Methods Experiments were designed to investigate the germination characteristics of black and brown seed morphs of Suaeda splendens, an annual, C-4 shrub of non-tidal, saline steppes. The resulting seedlings were transferred to hydroponic culture to investigate their growth and photosynthetic (PSII photochemistry and gas exchange) responses to salinity. Key Results Black seeds germinated at low salinity but were particularly sensitive to increasing salt concentrations, and strongly inhibited by light. Brown seeds were unaffected by light, able to germinate at higher salinities and generally germinated more rapidly. Ungerminated black seeds maintained viability for longer than brown ones, particularly at high salinity. Seedlings derived from both seed morphs grew well at high salinity (400 mol m(-3) NaCl). However, seedlings derived from brown seeds performed poorly at low salinity, as reflected in relative growth rate, numbers of branches produced, F-v/F-m and net rate of CO2 assimilation. Conclusions The seeds most likely to germinate at high salinity in the Mediterranean summer (brown ones) retain a requirement for higher salinity as seedlings that might be of adaptive value. On the other hand, black seeds, which are likely to delay germination until lower salinity prevails, produce seedlings that are less sensitive to salinity. It is not clear why performance at low salinity, later in the life cycle, might have been sacrificed by the brown seeds, to achieve higher fitness at the germination stage under high salinity. Analyses of adaptive syndromes associated with seed dimorphism may need to take account of differences over the entire life cycle, rather than just at the germination stage.","[Redondo-Gomez, Susana; Mateos-Naranjo, Enrique; Cambrolle, Jesus; Luque, Teresa; Figueroa, M.

Physiological properties have a great effect on the development process of kenaf. Physiological properties are significantly affected by seasonal air temperature changes and precipitation, as well as fluctuations during the day. The main reason for these fluctuations is seen as instant changes in environmental factors. In this study, it was aimed to determine the hourly changes of leaf gas exchange parameters of drip-irrigated kenaf plant and to examine the relationships between these parameters. Field experiment was conducted in Bursa, Turkey, which has sub-humid climatic conditions. For this purpose, net photosynthesis rate (A), stomatal conductivity (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and transpiration rate ( E) measurements were carried out on 18th September 2019 and 26th September 2020, between 08:00 h and 18:00 h. As a result of the study, while it was determined that A, gs, Ci and E parameters varied between 14.75-23.67 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), 0.23- 0.74 mol H (2) O m(-2) s(-1), 243-331 mu mol CO2 mol air(-1) and 2.67-7.37 mmol H (2) O m(-2) s(-1), respectively in 2019, they varied between 13.97-22.30 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), 0.29-0.58 mol H2O m(-2) s(-1), 217-278 mu mol CO2 mol air(-1) and 6.3-14.7 mmol H2O m(-2) s(-1), respectively in 2020.

This study used electronic high-precision dendrometry for analyzing the environmental factors controlling stem diameter variation and radial growth in daily resolution in five co-existing temperate broad-leaved tree species (genera Fraxinus, Acer, Carpinus, Tilia and Fagus) with different growth and survival strategies. Daily stem radius change (SRCd) was primarily influenced by the atmospheric demand for water vapor (expressed either as vapor pressure deficit (D) or relative air humidity (RH)) while rainfall, soil matrix potential, temperature and radiation were only secondary factors. SRCd increased linearly with increasing RH and decreasing D in all species. The positive effect of a low atmospheric water vapor demand on SRCd was largest in June during the period of maximal radial growth rate and persisted when observation windows of 7 or 21 days instead of 1 day were used. We found a high synchronicity in the day-to-day growth rate fluctuation among the species with increment peaks corresponding to air humidity maxima, even though the mean daily radial growth rate differed fivefold among the species. The five -species also differed in the positive slope of the growth/RH relationship with the steepest increase found in Fraxinus and the lowest in Fagus. We explain the strong positive effect of high RH and low D on radial stem increment by lowered transpiration which reduces negative pressure in the conducting system and increases turgor in the stem cambium cells, thereby favoring cell division and expansion. The results suggest that mechanistic models of tree growth need to consider the atmospheric water status in addition to the known controlling environmental factors: temperature, soil moisture and precipitation. The results further have implications for sensitivity analyses of tree growth to climatic changes.","[Koecher, Paul; Horna, Viviana; Leuschner, Christoph] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","University of Gottingen","Leuschner, C (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.","cleusch@gwdg.de","","Horna, Viviana/0000-0003-1273-2420","German Research Foundation (DFG) [Graduiertenkolleg 1086]","German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This study was conducted within the framework of Graduiertenkolleg 1086 with funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG).",NA,"63","73","83","6","101","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0829-318X","","","TREE PHYSIOL","Tree Physiol.","AUG","2012","32","8","",NA,"",NA,"1021","1032","","10.1093/treephys/tps049","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tps049","","","12","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","988CT","22659458","Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000307466500009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Here, we evaluated biomass productivity and composition, photosynthetic efficiency, and expression of NR2-2/2HbN for Heterosigma growing on simulated flue gas containing 12% CO2 and 150 ppm NO. Biomass productivity of Heterosigma more than doubled in flue gas conditions compared to controls, reflecting a 13-fold increase in carbohydrate and a 2-fold increase in protein productivity. Lipid productivity was not affected by flue gas and the valuable omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, constituted up to 16% of total fatty acid methyl esters. Photochemical measurements indicated that photosynthesis in Heterosigma is not inhibited by high CO2 and NO concentrations, and increases in individual fatty acids in response to flue gas were driven by photosynthetic requirements. Growth rates and maximum cell densities of Heterosigma grown on simulated flue gas without supplemental nitrogen, along with a significant increase in NR2-2/2HbN transcript abundance in response to flue gas, demonstrated that nitrogen derived from NO gas is biologically available to support enhanced CO2 fixation. Together, these results illustrate the robustness of this alga for commercial-scale biomass production and bioremediation of industrial emissions.","[Stewart, Jennifer J.; Coyne, Kathryn J.] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth, Ocean & Environm, 700 Pilottown Rd, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Bianco, Colleen M.] Univ Illinois, Dept Microbiol, Urbana, IL 60680 USA; [Miller, Katherine R.] Salisbury Univ, Dept Chem, Salisbury, MD 21801 USA","University of Delaware; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University System of Maryland; Salisbury University","Stewart, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Coll Earth, Ocean & Environm, 700 Pilottown Rd, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.","jen@udel.edu","","","United States Department of Agriculture [USDA-NIFA-2011-67012-31175]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through Delaware Sea Grant [NA100AR4170084-12, NA140AR4170087]; National Science Foundation [1314003]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Chemistry [1314003] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","United States Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through Delaware Sea Grant; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Chemistry(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS))","This work was supported by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-NIFA-2011-67012-31175 to JS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through Delaware Sea Grant (Award #NA100AR4170084-12 to JS and KC and Award #NA140AR4170087 to JS and KC), and the National Science Foundation (Award #1314003 to JS).

This island of arcto-alpine tundra represents the northernmost edge of Dwarf pine natural range. We asked how concentration of sulphur in needles, growth, healthy status and fructification changed over three decades (1981-2011) with different air pollution in differently aged (45-120 years) autochtonous and allochtonous (introduced from the Alps) Dwarf pine stands. Different Dwarf pine stands above the alpine timberline were able to withstand 1980s, the period of heavy air pollution, without any decrease in growth rate or remarkable decrease in healthy status. Dwarf pine is thus highly tolerant to deposition of sulphur compounds. High concentration of SO2 in the air positively affected sulphur concentration in needles and eliminated thus sulphur deficiency. Higher germination rate of seeds in 2000s in comparison with 1980s indicate that the air pollution could decrease germination ability of seeds. High insect outbreaks (by Thecodiplosis brachyntera and Neodiprion sertifer) in 1990s and 2000s caused decrease in needle year classes. As there was a gradual increase in mean annual temperature over years 1981-2011, Dwarf pine stands can be more and more endangered by insect outbreaks in the future. There was no remarkable difference between autochtonous and allochtonous stands in all measured growth, healthy status and fructification characteristics.

A field experiment was carried out in two successive growing seasons at Kopais (southern Greece) to evaluate the effects of drought stress imposed by three irrigation treatments, and temperature during flowering and seed filling on lucerne seed yield and quality. Plant water status, expressed in terms of the water potential index (WPI), growth in leaf area and dry weight, seed yield and yield components, flowering and seed quality parameters were measured throughout the growing seasons. The adopted irrigation schemes produced a clear differentiation among treatments concerning their plant water status. Seed yield and leaf growth showed close positive correlations with WPI. An irrigation effect was also detected for the number of pods/plant, but not for the average weight of seeds/pod. Less negative values of WPI, and, especially, higher temperatures during flowering were also positively associated with a longer duration of flowering, as well as with higher total numbers of inflorescences. A very good description of the time course of seed germination was performed by fitting the Richards' function to the real data. By examining the germination parameters derived from this function it was found that final germination and germination rate were improved, while germination duration was shortened with more negative values of WPI. The effects of growing season and seeding period were occasionally equally or more important than irrigation effects. These results are also discussed in terms of their practical implications for seed producing lucerne crops.","[Karamanos, A. J.; Papastylianou, P.

Recently, the frequent occurrence of high temperature stress has heavily influenced rice production. Proper heading date in specific environmental conditions could ensure high grain yield. Rice heading greatly depends on the accurate measurement of environmental changes, particularly in day length and temperature. In contrary to the detailed understanding of the photoperiod pathway, little has been known about how temperature regulates the genetic control of rice heading. Results: Near isogenic lines that were segregated for qHd1, were developed from a cross between indica rice varieties Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and Milyang 46 (MY46). Using a five sowing-date experiment in the paddy field, we observed the involvement of qHd1 in temperature responses. With the gradual increase of temperature from Trial I to V, heading date of MY46 homozygotes continued to decrease for about 5 d per trial from 76 to 58 d, while that of ZS97 homozygotes was promoted at the same rate from Trial I to III and then stabilized at 69 d. This thermal response was confirmed in a temperature-gradient experiment conducted in the phytotron. It is also found that tolerance of the ZS97 allele to heading acceleration at high temperature was associated with higher grain weight that resulted in higher grain yield. Then, by qRT-PCR and RNA-seq, we found the pathway OsMADS51-Ehd1-RFT1/Hd3a underlying the qHd1-mediated floral response to temperature. By sequence comparison, OsMADS51 for qHd1 displayed a 9.5-kb insertion in the 1st intron of the ZS97 allele compared to the MY46 allele. Furthermore, this large insertion is commonly found in major early-season indica rice varieties, but not in the middle-and late-season ones, which corresponds to the requirement for high-temperature tolerance during the heading and grain-filling stages of early-season rice. Conclusions: Beneficial alleles at qHd1 confer tolerance to high temperatures at the heading and grain-filling stages, playing a significant role in the eco-geographical adaptation of early-season indica rice during modern breeding. These results, together with the underlying OsMADS51-Ehd1-RFT1/Hd3a floral pathway, provide valuable information for better understanding the molecular mechanism of temperature responsive regulation of heading date and yield traits in rice.","[Ma, Liang-Yong; Zhuang, Jie-Yun] China Natl Rice Res Inst, State Key Lab Rice Biol, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; China Natl Rice Res Inst, Chinese Natl Ctr Rice Improvement, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; China National Rice Research Institute, CAAS; Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; China National Rice Research Institute, CAAS","Ma, LY; Zhuang, JY (corresponding author), China Natl Rice Res Inst, State Key Lab Rice Biol, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.","maliangyong@caas.cn; zhuangjieyun@caas.cn","; Zhuang, Jie-Yun/B-4131-2012","Chen, Jun-Yu/0000-0002-0418-3209; Zhuang, Jie-Yun/0000-0002-1439-5061","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31701398, 31371605]; Chinese 863 Program [2014AA10A604-15]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese 863 Program(National High Technology Research and Development Program of China)","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31701398, 31371605) and the Chinese 863 Program (2014AA10A604-15).",NA,"50","18","19","3","22","BMC","LONDON","CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","1471-2229","","","BMC PLANT BIOL","BMC Plant Biol.","JUN 7","2018","18","","",NA,"",NA,"","","112","10.1186/s12870-018-1330-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1330-5","","","11","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","GJ0VF","29879910","Green Published, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000434971800003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, measurements of fitness costs may not be straightforward as they vary with environmental conditions. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), has developed resistance to spinosad, the first insecticide of the Naturalyte class, after only a few years of field application of this product. In this study, we compared the performance of two homogenous strains of P. xylostella, one susceptible (SS) and the other resistant (RR) to spinosad at an unfavourable, low natural temperature regime, a favourable median-fluctuating temperature regime and an unfavourable high-fluctuating temperature regime. The RR strain showed only marginal fitness cost at the median temperature regime. At the low temperature regime, the RR strain failed to produce any viable offspring, while the SS strain achieved positive population growth. At the high temperature regime, the RR strain showed a 33% decrease in intrinsic rate of increase compared to the SS strain. The results demonstrate that fitness costs of resistance to spinosad are temperature-dependent, increasing in scale at unfavourably low and high temperatures; costs were particularly high at low temperatures.

We examined twelve impacted streams in two western Oregon watersheds: the Calapooia River in the western Cascades and the Williams River in the Coast Range. Red alder (Maus rubra) and willow (Salix spp.) were the dominant species on debris torrented areas in both watersheds. Post-disturbance vegetation recovery was significant in both watersheds, impacting shade and stream temperatures. However, red alder density, basal area, and height were significantly greater along streams in the Williams River watershed than along streams in the Calapooia River watershed. Willow density, basal area and height were similar between the watersheds. Stream shading levels mirrored red alder growth, with greater average shading in the Williams River watershed. The greater shade translated into lower summer maximum stream temperatures and maximum diurnal stream temperature fluctuations in the Williams River as compared to the Calapooia River watershed. Minimum stream temperatures were not different between the two watersheds. The rapid re-growth of red alder along the Williams River watershed ultimately lead to a rapid decline in maximum summer stream temperatures for that watershed compared to the Calapooia River watershed. The location where the disturbance occurred had an important role in determining the rate and pathway of stream recovery. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Temperatures achieved during solarization follow the diurnal cycle, with maximum temperatures occurring during the day and the minimums during the night. However, most of the information on rate of thermal inactivation of pathogens has been collected in the laboratory under constant temperature conditions. Such data are not readily useful for modeling solarization efficacy. Accurate prediction of the effective level of pest control that one can obtain during a solarization requires that we assess thermal inactivation of pathogens under fluctuating climatic conditions. By modeling, we attempt to separate the effect of heat at varying temperatures on pest control. This can be done either empirically or by utilizing thermal inactivation data, which were accomplished by exposing the pathogens to heat at constant temperatures. Structural solarization is carried out by closing the greenhouse for a certain period of time during the hot season. Air temperature inside the structure during the hot hours can reach levels above 60 degrees C. The consequent relative humidity (RH) drops to 15%; thus, structural solarization can be regarded as dry heating. Low humidity values lead to reduced effectiveness of thermal inactivation of pathogens. Thus, a model of structural solarization should consider both diurnal fluctuating temperatures and RH values. Using a modified Weibull model based on temperature and RH, we were able to obtain good agreement between calculated and observed rates of kill of inoculum of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) and of sclerotia of Sclerotium rolfsii (SR). The R-2 values for FORL control ranged in most experiments from 0.86 to 0.98 and for SR control from 0.82 to 0.94. Soil solarization is carried out in wet soil. Therefore, a model of pest control needs to only consider diurnal temperature fluctuations. The data on pathogen control under constant temperatures were used to develop equations in which the weighting of the obtained temperatures was normalized to degree-hours (NDH). The rate of pathogen control was positively correlated with heating intensity, as expressed in NDH above certain temperatures. The R-2 values for correlations between NDH and pathogen survival during soil solarization at 10 to 40cm depths was 0.53 to 0.86 for FORL and 0.82 to 0.95 for SR. At lower soil depths (40 cm), R-2 values were lower for FORL, suggesting the involvement of additional factors, e.g. biocontrol. The above modeling approaches can provide tools for quantifying solarization effectiveness under various climatic conditions.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Hebrew University of Jerusalem","Shlevin, E (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Agr Food & Environm Qual Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.","","","","","","",NA,"14","1","1","0","5","INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE","LEUVEN 1","PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM","0567-7572","","90-6605-218-X","ACTA HORTIC","","","2005",NA,"698","",NA,"",NA,"167","173","","10.17660/ActaHortic.2005.698.22","http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2005.698.22","","","7","Horticulture; Soil Science","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Agriculture","BEI25",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000237311900022","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the role that some relevant functional traits involved in resource uptake and/or stress tolerance could play on these inter-specific differences in phenological sensitivity remains largely unknown. In this study we evaluated experimentally how five co-occurring herbaceous species with contrasting functional strategies respond to current and ongoing climatic scenarios of increased temperature, decreased water availability and both abiotic changes acting interactively. To decompose the direct effect of climate change and the indirect effect of neighbors on plant performance and reproductive phenology, each of the five species was exposed to a density gradient of competitor species. Although the study species were more sensitive to changes in temperature than in water availability, the combined effect of both abiotic cues triggered very heterogeneous responses. Species with higher SLA values were particularly sensitive to climate change, delaying their reproduction and lengthening their flowering period under wanner scenarios while maintaining a high plant growth rate. In contrast, the species with the lowest SLA values exhibited less phenological variability to climate alterations, but they were more strongly affected by neighbor density compared to species with opposite trait values. These species-specific responses to climatic shifts altered the synchrony of phenological events at the community level. The most important changes appeared under the two scenarios of increased temperature, where 4 out of 5 species overlapped their flowering periods. Our findings indicate that the ongoing scenarios of increasing temperature and aridity could disrupt the phenological asynchrony within communities, and highlight the necessity of considering the interactive effects of temperature and precipitation to obtain an overall picture of climate change predictions on plant phenology and population dynamics.","[Perez-Ramos, I.

Under natural conditions, three replicate experiments were conducted in which water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total ammonia, unionised ammonia, phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton (number of living and dead organisms, mortality rate and instant mortality) were studied. The time-course of unionised ammonia concentration was consistent with those shown by temperature, pH, phytoplankton biomass, dissolved oxygen, Moina micrura mortality and Brachionus rubens mortality. On the other hand, temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen never exceeded the tolerance ranges described for Moina and Brachionus, which led us to attribute the cause of zooplankton mortality to unionised ammonia toxicity. Mortality rates of 63%, 27% and 34% were recorded for Moina in each replicate experiment. Brachionus was less affected, with mortalities of 7.3%, 6.2% and 6.0%. These results confirm previous field observations (Water Res. 34(14) (2000) 3666; Water Res. 37(5) (2003) 1048) that attributed a reduction in zooplankton biomass during certain periods of summer (algal blooms) to a harmful side-effect of an excessive increase in phytoplankton biomass: high photosynthetic activity during these periods of proliferation of algae gives rise to an increased pH (greater than or equal to8) and, subsequently, leads to production of unionised ammonia (toxic for aquatic organisms) from its ionised fraction.

Density-independent weather effects can have important consequences for the demography of terrestrial herbivores because precipitation, temperature and insolation influence plant phenology, forage quality and biomass production, which in turn affects the habitat carrying capacity. Since forage digestibility influences intake and weight gain, life-history traits of young, growing animals are Likely to reflect variation in the prevailing weather. 2. This paper specifically investigates spatial and temporal variation in age at maturation in female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway in relation to climate variables known to influence primary production. Our findings are corroborated by analysing differences in age at maturation in 21 cohorts of red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland. 3. In Norway the majority of females ovulated as yearlings and calved for the first time as 2-year-olds. The proportion calving for the first time at two years varied from 0.23 to 0.67 between regions and fluctuated from 0.46 to 0.76 between cohorts. On Rum, where age of maturation was delayed at least a year, the proportion calving for the first time as 3-year-olds varied between cohorts from 0.0 to 0.89. 4. In a subset of yearlings culled in Norway at the time of conception, the spatial and temporal differences in ovulation rates were related to the geographical and annual variation in body weight. 5. Both the spatial and temporal variation in the proportion of 2-year-olds calving in Norway, and cohort differences in the proportion calving as 3-year-olds on Rum, were negatively related to variation in May-June degree days 12 months earlier. 6. Although primary production on the preferred herb-rich Agrostis-Festuca grasslands was positively correlated with temperature in May and June on Rum, the proportion of females calving as three years old, was negatively correlated with annual differences in May-June primary production. 7. We argue that retarded phenological development, during periods of cooler weather, enhances diet quality because leaf:stem ratios and digestibility of plant parts decline more slowly. Thus, weight gain during the early summer growth spurt should be rapid during cool May-June weather, increasing the probability of conception in the autumn. 8. Since density-independent variation in food availability also influences fitness components which commonly have a more pronounced influence on population demography, for example offspring survival, we argue that our results highlight the potential importance of variation in weather on herbivore abundance.","ZOOL SOC LONDON, INST ZOOL, LONDON NW1 4RY, ENGLAND; UNIV OSLO, DEPT BIOL, DIV ZOOL, N-0316 OSLO, NORWAY; UNIV CAMBRIDGE, DEPT ZOOL, CAMBRIDGE CB2 3EJ, ENGLAND","Zoological Society of London; University of Oslo; University of Cambridge","Langvatn, R (corresponding author), NORWEGIAN INST NAT RES, TUNGASLETTA 2, N-7005 TRONDHEIM, NORWAY.","","ALBON, Stephen D/C-6304-2011","ALBON, Stephen D/0000-0002-0811-1333","","","",NA,"92","204","207","5","75","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-8790","1365-2656","","J ANIM ECOL","J.

At 12, 16 and 20 degrees C growth resembled a sigmoid curve, and was optimally described by logistic functions. At 4 and 8 degrees C the animals did not reach the inflection point, and growth was described by exponential functions. Absolute or incremental growth rates (Delta WWT/Delta t) fluctuate in a nonlinear manner with size and age, and were maximal around the inflection point. Relative, instantaneous or specific,growth rates (G(s), % body WWT day(-1)) were highest near birth and declined in a monotonic exponential fashion with increasing body weight and age. The effect of water temperature on relative growth rates was well described by power functions. Growth of C. fossarum and G. roeseli are quantitatively compared.

We evaluated the effects of allozyme MLH and SLH on basal (control animals) and induced (stressed animals) levels of the Hsp70 in juveniles C concholepas. juveniles (n=400) were acclimated at 16 degrees C for 2 weeks; then 100 animals were exposed to 24 degrees C (stress) and 100 were kept at 16 degrees C (control) for 2 and 7 days. The variability of 20 loci was analyzed by starch gel electrophoresis. For SLH effects we used 7 polymorphic loci. We quantified expression of Hsp70 by Western blot analyses. Hsp70 expression increased markedly (similar to 90%) with temperature. We found a positive association between MLH and basal and induced levels of Hsp70 in the 2-day exposure experiment. Regardless of temperature, Hsp70 levels increased with MLH (r(2) = 0.7 and 0.9, for basal and induced levels, respectively) reaching maximal levels in juveniles with intermediate and high MLH levels (2 and 3 loci). and decreasing slightly (but not significantly) in juveniles with highest MLH (?:4 heterozygous loci). However, after 7 days of exposure to thermal stress, less heterozygous juveniles attained the same levels of Hsp70 than more heterozygous juveniles. Given the faster increment of Hsp70 in C. concholepas juveniles with intermediate-high levels of MLH, these individuals could be less affected by thermal stress in the intertidal zone. We found an association between specific loci genotype and higher Hsp70 levels (basal or induced). In comparison to homozygous juveniles, heterozygous juveniles for several loci showed higher Hsp70. However, these associations were not for the same loci in juveniles exposed to high temperature for 2 and 7 days. This suggests genotypic variation at some allozyme loci could be more important in the period of initial response to high temperature and others can be more important in the response to the chronic temperature stress.

Aromata) to continuous light (CL) in relation to photosynthesis, abscisic acid (ABA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was investigated to improve the understanding of the development and/or alleviation of CL-induced leaf injury in constant and diurnal temperature fluctuations with similar daily light integral and daily mean temperature. The plants were grown in three photoperiodic treatments for 15 days; One treatment with a 16/8 h light/dark period and a light/dark temperature of 27/17 degrees C (Control), two CL treatments with 24 h photoperiods, one with a constant temperature of 24 degrees C (CLCT) and the other one with variable temperature of 27/17 degrees C for 16/8 ho, respectively (CLVT). A diurnal pattern of stomatal conductance (g(s)) and [ABA] was observed in the plants grown in the control and CLVT conditions, while the plants in CLCT conditions experienced a significant decrease in stomatal conductance aligned with an increase in ABA. The net photosynthesis (A) was significantly reduced in CLCT, aligned with a significant decrease in the maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax), the maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)) and mesophyll diffusion conductance to CO2 (g(m)) in comparison to the control and CLVT. An increased production of H2O2 and O-2(center dot-) linked with increased activities of antioxidative enzymes was seen in both CL treatments, but despite of this, leaf injuries were only observed in the CLCT treatment. The results suggest that the diurnal temperature fluctuations alleviated the CL injury symptoms, probably because the diurnal cycles of cellular mechanisms were maintained. The ROS were shown not to be directly involved in CL-induced leaf injury, since both ROS production and scavenging was highest in CLVT without leaf chlorotic symptoms.","[Haque, Mohammad S.] Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Crop Bot, Mymensingh, Bangladesh; [Haque, Mohammad S.; Kjaer, Katrine H.; Ottosen, Carl-Otto] Aarhus Univ, Dept Food Sci, Aarhus, Denmark; [de Sousa, Alexandra; Soares, Cristiano; Fidalgo, Fernanda] Univ Porto, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol, Biosyst & Integrat Sci Inst, Oporto, Portugal; [Rosenqvist, Eva] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark","Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU); Aarhus University; BIOISI; Universidade do Porto; University of Copenhagen","Haque, MS (corresponding author), Bangladesh Agr Univ, Dept Crop Bot, Mymensingh, Bangladesh.;Haque, MS (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Food Sci, Aarhus, Denmark.","mshaqcb@bau.edu.bd","Fidalgo, Fernanda/A-7399-2010; Soares, Cristiano/U-8955-2017; Haque, Sabibul/AAW-2898-2021","Fidalgo, Fernanda/0000-0001-7756-5243; Soares, Cristiano/0000-0003-3330-2024; HAQUE, MD.

It is thought that facilitation results from stress amelioration, but it is unclear which of the many stressors acting in these environments is ameliorated. We aimed at determining the relative importance of different stressors as drivers of facilitation by the tussock Festuca tolucensis in Mexico. We employed eight experimental treatments to manipulate five stressors in the field: minimum temperatures by using electric radiators that kept plants warm; maximum temperatures by means of reflective sand that precluded temperature build-up during the day; UV radiation by using screens opaque to UV; poor soil properties by comparing soils from beneath tussocks and from bare ground; and low water availability by adding vermiculite to the soil. The performance (survival and growth) of Mexerion sarmentosum (a plant usually associated with Festuca) in these treatments was compared to that recorded under tussocks and in bare ground. Amelioration of extreme temperatures had the largest positive effects on Mexerion survival. UV radiation and increased soil humidity did not affect survival, although humidity increased growth rates. Nevertheless, tussocks reduced the growth of Mexerion, which is consistent with observations of competition between plants and soil microorganisms favoured by tussocks. Our results highlight the importance of the extreme daily fluctuations in temperature that characterise tropical mountains as fundamental drivers of their dynamics.","[Pedraza, Fernando; Garcia-Meza, Diego; Martorell, Carlos] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Ecol Recursos & Nat, Fac Ciencias, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Tovar, Hugo] Inst Nacl Med Genom, Unidad Serv Bioinformat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Instituto Nacional de Medicina Genomica","Martorell, C (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Dept Ecol Recursos & Nat, Fac Ciencias, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.","martorell@ciencias.unam.mx","Tovar, Hugo/AAD-8274-2021","Tovar, Hugo/0000-0002-8360-6133; Garcia-Meza, Diego/0000-0003-1959-0074","Programa de Apoyos a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica-Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico [IN217607, IN212618]","Programa de Apoyos a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica-Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","This work received support from Programa de Apoyos a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica-Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (https://dgapa.unam.mx/index.php/impulso-a-la-investigacion/papiit) in the form of grants (IN217607 and IN212618) awarded to CM.",NA,"57","0","0","1","1","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","NOV 13","2020","15","11","",NA,"",NA,"","","e0242313","10.1371/journal.pone.0242313","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242313","","","13","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","OY0NB","33186374","Green Published, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000593949800041","View Full Record in Web of Science"

MethodsUsing 'Hei Zhenzhu' and 'Xiangnong Xiangyun' as experimental materials, the winter growth environment of L. chinense var. rubrum in Changsha, Hunan Province was simulated by setting a low temperature of 6-10 degrees C in an artificial climate chamber to investigate the effect of winter low temperature on the flowering traits and related gene expression of L. chinense var. rubrum. ResultsThe results showed that after 45 days of low temperature culture and a subsequent period of 25 degrees C greenhouse culture, flower buds and flowers started to appear on days 24 and 33 of 25 degrees C greenhouse culture for 'Hei Zhenzhu', and flower buds and flowers started to appear on days 21 and 33 of 25 degrees C greenhouse culture for 'Xiangnong Xiangyun'. The absolute growth rate of buds showed a 'Up-Down' pattern during the 7-28 days of low temperature culture; the chlorophyll fluorescence decay rate (Rfd) of both materials showed a 'Down-Up-Down' pattern during this period. The non-photochemical quenching coefficient (NPQ) showed the same trend as Rfd, and the photochemical quenching coefficient (QP) fluctuated above and below 0.05. The expression of AP1 and FT similar genes of L. chinense var. rubrum gradually increased after the beginning of low temperature culture, reaching the highest expression on day 14 and day 28, respectively, and the expression of both in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group. The expressions of FLC, SVP and TFL1 similar genes all decreased gradually with low temperature culture, among which the expressions of FLC similar genes and TFL1 similar genes in the experimental group were extremely significantly lower than those in the control group; in the experimental group, the expressions of GA3 similar genes were all extremely significantly higher than those in the control group, and the expressions all increased with the increase of low temperature culture time. DiscussionWe found that the high expression of gibberellin genes may play an important role in the process of low temperature promotion of L. chinense var. rubrum flowering, and in the future, it may be possible to regulate L. chinense var. rubrum flowering by simply spraying exogenous gibberellin instead of the promotion effect of low temperature.","[Zhang, Damao; Chen, Qianru; Zhang, Xia; Cai, Wenqi; Liu, Yang; Xiang, Lili; Yu, Xiaoying; Li, Yanlin] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Damao; Chen, Qianru; Zhang, Xia; Cai, Wenqi; Liu, Yang; Xiang, Lili; Yu, Xiaoying; Li, Yanlin] Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Hort Crop Germplasm Creat & New Varie, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Damao; Chen, Qianru; Zhang, Xia; Cai, Wenqi; Liu, Yang; Xiang, Lili; Yu, Xiaoying; Li, Yanlin] Hunan Midsubtrop Qual Plant Breeding & Utilizat En, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Lin, Ling] Hunan Agr Univ, Sch Econ, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Cai, Ming; Sun, Ming] Beijing Forestry Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Floriculture, Sch Landscape Architecture, Beijing Key Lab Ornamental Plants Germplasm Innova, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanlin] Kunpeng Inst Modern Agr, Foshan, Peoples R China","Hunan Agricultural University; Hunan Agricultural University; Beijing Forestry University","Yu, XY; Li, YL (corresponding author), Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Hort, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.;Yu, XY; Li, YL (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Engn Res Ctr Hort Crop Germplasm Creat & New Varie, Changsha, Peoples R China.;Yu, XY; Li, YL (corresponding author), Hunan Midsubtrop Qual Plant Breeding & Utilizat En, Changsha, Peoples R China.;Sun, M (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Floriculture, Sch Landscape Architecture, Beijing Key Lab Ornamental Plants Germplasm Innova, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Li, YL (corresponding author), Kunpeng Inst Modern Agr, Foshan, Peoples R China.","sun.sm@163.com; 475705701@qq.com; liyanlin@hunau.edu.cn","","","Innovation training program for college students of Hunan Agricultural University [XCX2021044]; National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students [202112653017X]; Open Project of Horticulture Discipline of Hunan Agricultural University [2021YYXK001]; Forestry Science and Technology Innovation Foundation of Hunan Province for Distinguished Young Scholarship [XLKJ202205]; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Hunan Province for College Students [201941937227]; Found of Changsha Municipal Science and Technology Bureau [KQ2202227]; Hunan Provincial Natural Science Youth Foundation Project [2020JJ5264]; Hunan Provincial Education Department Teaching reform Project [2021JGYB101]; Hunan Agricultural University Teaching reform research project [XJJG-2020-071]","Innovation training program for college students of Hunan Agricultural University; National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students; Open Project of Horticulture Discipline of Hunan Agricultural University; Forestry Science and Technology Innovation Foundation of Hunan Province for Distinguished Young Scholarship; Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Hunan Province for College Students; Found of Changsha Municipal Science and Technology Bureau; Hunan Provincial Natural Science Youth Foundation Project; Hunan Provincial Education Department Teaching reform Project; Hunan Agricultural University Teaching reform research project","The work is funded by the Innovation training program for college students of Hunan Agricultural University (XCX2021044), National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program for College Students (202112653017X), Open Project of Horticulture Discipline of Hunan Agricultural University (2021YYXK001), The Forestry Science and Technology Innovation Foundation of Hunan Province for Distinguished Young Scholarship (XLKJ202205), Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program of Hunan Province for College Students (201941937227), The Found of Changsha Municipal Science and Technology Bureau (KQ2202227), Hunan Provincial Natural Science Youth Foundation Project (2020JJ5264), Hunan Provincial Education Department Teaching reform Project (2021JGYB101), Hunan Agricultural University Teaching reform research project (XJJG-2020-071).",NA,"71","0","0","8","8","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-462X","","","FRONT PLANT SCI","Front.

There is also a shift in location of the biomass from mostly belowground in the grasslands to aboveground in the woodlands. In addition, species richness and diversity change as herbaceous species are replaced by woody species. This is not a new phenomenon, but has been going on continually as the climate of the Planet has changed. However, in the past 160 years the changes have been unparalleled. The process is encroachment not invasion because woody species that have been increasing in density are native species and have been present in these communities for thousands of years. These indigenous or native woody species have increased in density, cover and biomass because of changes in one or more abiotic or biotic factors or conditions. Woody species that have increased in density and cover are not the cause of the encroachment, but the result of changes of other factors. Globally, the orbit of the Earth is becoming more circular and less elliptical, causing moderation of the climate. Additional global climate changing factors including elevated levels of CO2 and parallel increases in temperature are background factors and probably not the principal causes directing the current wave of encroachment. There is probably not a single reason for encroachment, but a combination of factors that are difficult to disentangle. The prime cause of the current and recent encroachment appears to be high and constant levels of grass herbivory by domestic animals. This herbivory reduces fine fuel with a concomitant reduction in fire frequency or in some cases a complete elimination of fire from these communities. Conditions would now favor the woody plants over the grasses. Reduced grass competition, woody plant seed dispersal and changes in animal populations seem to modify the rate of encroachment rather than being the cause. High concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are not required to explain current woody plant encroachment. Changes in these grassland communities will continue into the future but the specifics are difficult to predict. Density, cover and species composition will fluctuate and will probably continue to change. Increased levels of anthropogenic soil nitrogen suggest replacement of many legumes by other woody species. Modification and perhaps reversal of the changes in these former grassland communities will be an arduous, continuing and perhaps impossible management task.

In this study, the temporal trends and spatial patterns of DTR fluctuations over the last 35 years (1981-2015) in Bangladesh are examined. The annual mean DTR of Bangladesh has progressively increased over the last few decades and the increasing amplitude is shown to have spatial and seasonal trends. Seasonal and spatial as well as interregional changes in DTR for the four regions of northwestern, northeastern, southwestern and southeastern are investigated. Seasonal DTR trends show a decreasing with a rate of -0.03 degrees C/decade in winter and an increase in pre-monsoon (0.13 degrees C/decade), monsoon (0.17 degrees C/decade) and post-monsoon (0.11 degrees C/decade). Southeastern region in DTR has increased significantly out of four regions but the other three regions have decreased. Monsoon season (June-September) has shown a significant increase in DTR in all regions. DTR is observed to decrease significantly in the winter season for both northwest and northeast regions, and has also decreased significantly/non-significantly for the pre-monsoon season for the northwest/northeast region. Similarly, post-monsoon (October-November) seasons have experienced smaller increases in DTR for all regions except southwest regions where it has decreased. The temporal trends and regional patterns of daily maximum and minimum temperatures are also examined to get insight into DTR alterations. A significant increasing trend of 0.24, 0.14, and 0.10 degrees C/decade has been observed in mean maximum (TMAX), mean minimum (TMIN) and diurnal temperature range (DTR; TMAX-TMIN), respectively, during the period of analysis.

In the climate-simulated culturing studies, the volumetric ash-free dry weight-based biomass productivities during the linear growth phase were 57, 69, and 97 mg L-1 day(-1) for 30-year averaged light and temperature simulations for January (winter), March (spring), and July (summer), respectively, which correspond to average areal productivities of 11.6, 14.1, and 19.9 g m(-2) day(-1). The photosynthetic efficiencies (PAR) in these three climate-simulated pond culturing experiments ranged from 4.1 to 5.1%. The annual biomass productivity was estimated as ca. 15 g m(-2) day(-1), nearly double the US Department of Energy (DOE) 2015 State of Technology annual cultivation productivity of 8.5 g m(-2) day(-1), but still well below the projected DOE 2022 target of ca. 25 g m(-2) day(-1) required for economic microalgal biofuel production, indicating the need for additional research.","[Huesemann, M.; Chavis, A.; Edmundson, S.; Rye, D.; Hobbs, S.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Marine Sci Lab, Sequim, WA 98382 USA; [Sun, N.; Wigmosta, M.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Hydrol Grp, Richland, WA 99352 USA","United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory","Huesemann, M (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Marine Sci Lab, Sequim, WA 98382 USA.","michael.huesemann@pnnl.gov","","","Bioenergy Technologies Office, US Department of Energy [DE-EE0006316, DE-EE0006317]; New Mexico State University; California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; Department of Energy Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship Program","Bioenergy Technologies Office, US Department of Energy; New Mexico State University; California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; Department of Energy Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship Program","This research was funded by the Bioenergy Technologies Office, US Department of Energy (Agreements DE-EE0006316 and DE-EE0006317), via subcontracts from New Mexico State University and California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, respectively.

As human impacts on the environment directly and indirectly alter resource availability, it is important to address plant responses to changing resources to be able to anticipate impacts of these changes on plant communities. We analyzed plant traits to assess responses to resource limitation in four Sahelian tree species of wide ecological and socio-economic importance. We used species already adapted to harsh conditions (high temperatures, low rainfall) to anticipate how climate change could affect their growth patterns and, indirectly, their spatial distribution and the services they provide. Seedlings grew under two levels of water and nutrient additions in a factorial design. Our results showed differences among species, watering regimes, and nutrient supply in three key functional traits related to the plant's resource-use strategy, relative growth rate (RGR), root-to-shoot ratio (R/S), and specific leaf area (SLA). On average, RGR was responsive to the amount of water and nutrients, with species with high RGR showing the largest response to resource supply. RGR in the species with a conservative resource-use strategy (evergreen leaves, lowest RGR) remained unchanged with different levels of water and nutrients. Overall, large RGR was supported by large SLA. All species allocated more biomass to roots than to shoots, particularly under low resource supply, reflecting adaptive strategies to keep RGR leveled to resource supply. Not all species showed similar plasticity in their functional traits responses; however, Acacia tortilis and Faidherbia albida showed the greatest plasticity, which may explain their large geographical distribution range in Africa. Our data suggest that the different Sahelian species will respond differently to future environmental changes, likely affecting their geographical distribution, the structure of plant communities, and the services they provide.","[Dieme, Joseph S.; Armas, Cristina; Pugnaire, Francisco I.] CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Ctra Sacramento S-N, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain; [Dieme, Joseph S.] Inst Senegalais Rech Agr, Dakar, Senegal; [Rusch, Graciela M.] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Hoyskoleringen 9, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Experimental de Zonas Aridas (EEZA); Norwegian Institute Nature Research","Dieme, JS (corresponding author), CSIC, Estn Expt Zonas Aridas, Ctra Sacramento S-N, La Canada De San Urbano 04120, Almeria, Spain.","josadi3@yahoo.fr","Armas, Cristina/A-1128-2012","Armas, Cristina/0000-0003-0356-8075; Dieme, Joseph Saturnin/0000-0003-2330-8801","FUNCITREE Project within the EU 7th Framework Programme [KBBE-2272657FP]; AEIMINECO [CGL2014-59010-R, CGL2017-84515-R]; Spanish Agency of International Cooperation for Development (AECID); FUNCITREE Project; Spanish Government [RYC-2012-12277]","FUNCITREE Project within the EU 7th Framework Programme; AEIMINECO(Spanish Government); Spanish Agency of International Cooperation for Development (AECID); FUNCITREE Project; Spanish Government(Spanish Government)","We thank Hermann Heilmeier and two anonymous reviewers for comments on an earlier draft of this manuscript.

These active biomolecules are a recent inclusion to the list of non-traditional phytohormones or plant growth regulators. Previous reports and articles have discussed their pro-regulatory roles in plant growth, development, signaling and delay of senescence. However, the multi-level control of SL biosynthesis is less known. The anabolic genes are strictly regulated through synchronized cooperation between crucial phytohormones. Epigenetic and microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation fine tunes the cellular accumulation of these putative phytohormones. The question now arises that why such multi-level intricate regulation at all is required for SLs, which were originally detected as under-rated germination and rhizosphere stimulants. This review answers the question in the backdrop of the positive roles of SLs in promoting abiotic stress resilience across diverse plant species. SLs reportedly accumulate in the plant tissues in response to environmental sub-optimal conditions like drought, salinity, temperature, nutrient deprivation and oxidative stresses. Fluctuations in the light quality and intensity also trigger variable accumulation of SLs, indicating their potential in regulating light stress as well. Though the exact roles of SLs have not yet been characterized, it is predicted that they possibly induce the expression of downstream osmolytes to maintain metabolic homeostasis in the stressed cells. Thus, exogenous treatments or transgenic approaches for higher SL bioaccumulation can be potential strategies for developing multiple abiotic stress tolerance in crops and plants.","[Banerjee, Aditya; Roychoudhury, Aryadeep] St Xaviers Coll Autonomous, Dept Biotechnol, 30 Mother Teresa Sarani, Kolkata 700016, W Bengal, India","St. Xavier's College Kolkata","Roychoudhury, A (corresponding author), St Xaviers Coll Autonomous, Dept Biotechnol, 30 Mother Teresa Sarani, Kolkata 700016, W Bengal, India.","aryadeep.rc@gmail.com","Banerjee, Aditya/ABB-3678-2021","Banerjee, Aditya/0000-0003-0365-5582","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Government of India [38(1387)/14/EMR-II]; University Grants Commission, Government of India","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Government of India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); University Grants Commission, Government of India(University Grants Commission, India)","Financial assistance from Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Government of India, through the research Grant [38(1387)/14/EMR-II] to Dr. Aryadeep Roychoudhury is gratefully acknowledged.

Decreasing crop productivity will further lead to increase in global hunger rate. Climate change results in environmental stress which has negative impact on plant-like deficiencies in growth, crop yield, permanent damage, or death if the plant remains in the stress conditions for prolonged period. Cold stress is one of the main abiotic stresses which have already affected the global crop production. Cold stress adversely affects the plants leading to necrosis, chlorosis, and growth retardation. Various physiological, biochemical, and molecular responses under cold stress have revealed that the cold resistance is more complex than perceived which involves multiple pathways. Like other crops, legumes are also affected by cold stress and therefore, an effective technique to mitigate cold-mediated damage is critical for long-term legume production. Earlier, crop improvement for any stress was challenging for scientific community as conventional breeding approaches like inter-specific or inter-generic hybridization had limited success in crop improvement. The availability of genome sequence, transcriptome, and proteome data provides in-depth sight into different complex mechanisms under cold stress. Identification of QTLs, genes, and proteins responsible for cold stress tolerance will help in improving or developing stress-tolerant legume crop. Cold stress can alter gene expression which further leads to increases in stress protecting metabolites to cope up the plant against the temperature fluctuations. Moreover, genetic engineering can help in development of new cold stress-tolerant varieties of legume crop. This paper provides a general insight into the omics approaches for cold stress in legume crops.","[Bhat, Kaisar Ahmad; Mahajan, Reetika; Pakhtoon, Mohammad Maqbool; Urwat, Uneeb; Zargar, Sajad Majeed] Sher E kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol Kashmir SKUA, Div Plant Biotechnol, Prote Lab, Shalimar, India; [Bhat, Kaisar Ahmad; Shah, Ali Asghar] Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah Univ, Sch Biosci & Biotechnol, Dept Biotechnol, Rajouri, India; [Pakhtoon, Mohammad Maqbool; Agrawal, Ankit] Rabindranath Tagore Univ, Dept Life Sci, Bhopal, India; [Bashir, Zaffar] Univ Kashmir, Deparment Microbiol, Srinagar, India; [Bhat, Basharat] Sher E kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol Kashmir, Div Anim Biotechnol, Srinagar, India; [Sofi, Parvaze A.] Sher E kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol Kashmir, Div Genet & Plant Breeding, Srinagar, India; [Masi, Antonio] Univ Padua, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Anim & Environm, Padua, Italy","Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences & Technology of Kashmir (SKUAST Kashmir); University of Kashmir; Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences & Technology of Kashmir (SKUAST Kashmir); Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences & Technology of Kashmir (SKUAST Kashmir); University of Padua","Zargar, SM (corresponding author), Sher E kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol Kashmir SKUA, Div Plant Biotechnol, Prote Lab, Shalimar, India.","smzargar@skuastkashmir.ac.in","Agrawal, Ankit/AAL-1175-2021","Agrawal, Ankit/0000-0003-0427-1126","DST KIRAN WOS-B, New Delhi, India [DST/WOS-B/2018/832]; NMHS GBPNIHESD, Almora, Uttrakhand, India [GBPNI/NMHS17-18/SG24/622]; Italian Ministry for University and Research's Progetti di Ricerca di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale (PRIN) [2020HB9PR9]; European Union","DST KIRAN WOS-B, New Delhi, India; NMHS GBPNIHESD, Almora, Uttrakhand, India; Italian Ministry for University and Research's Progetti di Ricerca di Rilevante Interesse Nazionale (PRIN)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)); European Union(European Commission)","RM and SMZ acknowledge the support of funding agency DST KIRAN WOS-B, New Delhi, India (Vide Project Sanction Order No. DST/WOS-B/2018/832).

Starch concentrations in root and stem tissues were determined regularly during shoot extension growth, dormancy and resprouting after dormancy. We used light microscopy (LM) combined with image analysis (IA) to determine the cellular localization and amount of starch in different cell types of stem and root tissues. Chemical analysis confirmed that starch concentrations were lower in plants receiving a high-N supply rate than in plants receiving a low-N supply rate. In all plants, the highest concentration of starch was in the roots. Light microscopy and IA showed that starch accumulated mainly in the phloem and cortical cells of both root and stem tissues. Starch grains were also regularly found in ray parenchyma cells. The amount of starch as well as the size of the grains showed strong seasonal fluctuations. In both roots and stems, starch concentrations were highest during predormancy and lowest during periods of shoot extension growth. At the time of resprouting, root cells of decapitated plants were more depleted of starch than root cells of intact plants, supporting the hypothesis that starch reserves in roots are important during the early phase of resprouting in coppice systems.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Short Rotat Forestry, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden; Forest Res Inst Sweden, S-75183 Uppsala, Sweden","Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","Von Fircks, Y (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Short Rotat Forestry, POB 7016, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.","","","","","","",NA,"31","52","54","1","14","HERON PUBLISHING","VICTORIA","202, 3994 SHELBOURNE ST, VICTORIA, BC V8N 3E2, CANADA","0829-318X","","","TREE PHYSIOL","Tree Physiol.","APR","1998","18","4","",NA,"",NA,"243","249","","","","","","7","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","ZG380","12651378","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000072995800004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Hence, P. aphrodite is an obligate crassulacean acid metabolism plant. Nevertheless, different night temperature greatly affected both the stomatal conductance and the contribution of ambient and respiratory CO2 to the nocturnal accumulation of malate. However, the amounts of nocturnal accumulated malate and daily deposited starch appeared to have no significant difference between the two groups. These results demonstrate that P. ahrodite is congruent with the characteristics of CAM plants having great flexibility and plasticity in response to changes in environmental conditions. In addition, the formation of reproductive stem, viz. spike, was noticeably inhibited by a constant warm temperature, but induced by a fluctuating warm day and cool night condition.

Nitrification process is very often, a crucial element of the wastewater treatment systems as bacteria responsible for ammonium and nitrite oxidation are slow growing microorganisms, making whole nitrification process vulnerable to external factors i.e. temperature, inhibition and load fluctuations. Growth and decay rate of nitrifiers decide about amount nitrifying biomass in the wastewater treatment plants, thus the nitrification efficiency. Paper presents analysis of the decay rate ( ba) estimation methodology based on respirometric assays measuring the oxygen uptake rate (OUR). Evaluation of this simple and cheap method was made based on decay estimation tests performed on sludge samples from side-stream partial nitritation reactor treating reject water from digested sludge dewatering. Database obtained from these tests were analyzed to evaluate the impact of respirometric assay duration on calculated decay rate values. 11 time ranges were selected for the performed analysis. Calculated ba values were compared showing the optimal test duration between 5-6 hours, while test shorter than 2 hours resulted in unsatisfactory b(a) outcome.","[Kokurewicz, Lukasz; Muszynski-Huhajlo, Mateusz; Miodonski, Stanislaw; Leoniak, Maciej] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Environm Engn, Plac Grunwaldzki 9, PL-50377 Wroclaw, Poland","Wroclaw University of Science & Technology","Miodonski, S (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Environm Engn, Plac Grunwaldzki 9, PL-50377 Wroclaw, Poland.","stanislaw.miodonski@gmail.com","","Muszynski-Huhajlo, Mateusz/0000-0001-6639-8320","National Centre for Research and Development [LIDER/16/0172/L-7/15/NCBR/2016]","National Centre for Research and Development(National Centre for Research & Development, Poland)","The authors gratefully acknowledge co-funding from the National Centre for Research and Development (grant no LIDER/16/0172/L-7/15/NCBR/2016).",NA,"27","0","0","0","2","E D P SCIENCES","CEDEX A","17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE","2267-1242","","","E3S WEB CONF","","","2019","100","","",NA,"",NA,"","","35","10.1051/e3sconf/201910000035","http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/201910000035","","","11","Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Energy & Fuels; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","BO2BO",NA,"Green Published, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000505056300034","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The experiment was conducted in replicate continuous flow coral reef mesocosms flushed with unfiltered sea water from Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii. Mesocosms were located in full sunlight and experienced diurnal and seasonal fluctuations in temperature and sea water chemistry characteristic of the adjacent reef flat. Treatment mesocosms were manipulated to simulate an increase in pCO(2) to levels expected in this century [midday pCO(2) levels exceeding control mesocosms by 365 +/- 130 mu atm (mean +/- sd)]. Acidification had a profound impact on the development and growth of crustose coralline algae (CCA) populations. During the experiment, CCA developed 25% cover in the control mesocosms and only 4% in the acidified mesocosms, representing an 86% relative reduction. Free-living associations of CCA known as rhodoliths living in the control mesocosms grew at a rate of 0.6 g buoyant weight year(-1) while those in the acidified experimental treatment decreased in weight at a rate of 0.9 g buoyant weight year(-1), representing a 250% difference. CCA play an important role in the growth and stabilization of carbonate reefs, so future changes of this magnitude could greatly impact coral reefs throughout the world. Coral calcification decreased between 15% and 20% under acidified conditions. Linear extension decreased by 14% under acidified conditions in one experiment. Larvae of the coral Pocillopora damicornis were able to recruit under the acidified conditions. In addition, there was no significant difference in production of gametes by the coral Montipora capitata after 6 months of exposure to the treatments.","[Jokiel, P. L.; Rodgers, K. S.; Cox, E.

We used a 3.5 year study of Daphnia population dynamics to infer when food, predators or temperature constrained growth of this population. Transitions between winter and summer consumer assemblages are concurrent with seasonal changes in water temperature, thermal structure (stratification/destratification), resources (autotrophic/heterotrophic-dominated production), and predator abundance and activity (e.g. Lepomis macrochirus and Chaoborus punctipennis). We sampled at weekly or less intervals from April 1992 to September 1995, and determined population abundances for all cladoceran species. For the Daphnia population (Daphnia ambigua + Daphnia parvula), we measured clutch size and length for all individuals. We used average water column temperature (where dissolved oxygen is >1 mg l(-1)) to estimate egg development time from an empirical model. Estimates of Daphnia population birth and death rate were thus generated from abundance, egg ratio and temperature/dissolved oxygen data. We compared observed birth rate (b(obs)) with expected birth rate (b(exp) +/- 95% CI; predicted for food-saturated conditions at ambient temperature). For variable (1-13 week) periods between late November and March, 1992-1995, water temperature was the primary factor constraining Daphnia population growth (b(obs) = b(exp)) From about April to early November, b(obs) < b(exp) suggested food-limited population growth. In spring, summer and early fall (March-October), population densities were several-fold lower than in late fall and winter (November-February). However, all else being equal, egg ratio and population birth rate data would have predicted that Daphnia abundance fluctuates over equivalent ranges in spring and fall. We interpret this discrepancy as evidence for increased rates of extrinsic mortality during the growing season and a seasonal shift in the relative importance of resource and predator regulation. The duration of predator suppression of crustacean population abundance in Lake Oglethorpe and other warm-latitude lakes (similar to 36 degrees N-27 degrees S) is longer (greater than or equal to 3-7 months) than that observed in north temperate lakes (1-2.5 months; 41-52 degrees N).","Savannah River Ecol Lab, Aiken, SC 29802 USA; Univ Georgia, Inst Ecol, Athens, GA 30602 USA","United States Department of Energy (DOE); Savannah River Ecology Laboratory; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia","Saunders, PA (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Ctr Ocean Sci, St Johns, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.","","","","","","",NA,"55","27","30","1","21","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0142-7873","","","J PLANKTON RES","J.

To develop a better understanding of the relationship between changes in soil conditions and a plant's below-ground respiratory costs, the effects of temperature and soil drying on citrus root respiration were quantified in controlled greenhouse experiments. Chambers designed for measuring the respiration of individual roots were used. Under moist soil conditions, root respiration in citrus increased exponentially with changes in soil temperature (Q(10) = 1.8-2.0), provided that the changes in temperature were short-term. However, when temperatures were held constant, root respiration did not increase exponentially with increasing temperatures. Instead, the roots acclimated to controlled temperatures above 23 degreesC, thereby reducing their metabolism in warmer soils. Under drying soil conditions, root respiration decreased gradually beginning at 6% soil water content and reached a minimum at <2% soil water content in sandy soil. A model was constructed from greenhouse data to predict diurnal patterns of fine root respiration based on temperature and soil water content. The model was then validated in the field using data obtained by CO2 trapping on root systems of mature citrus trees. The trees were grown at a site where the soil temperature and water content were manipulated. Respiration predicted by the model was in general agreement with observed rates, which indicates the model may be used to estimate entire root system respiration for citrus.","Penn State Univ, Dept Hort, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Univ Florida, IFAS, Ctr Citrus Res & Educ, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Bryla, DR (corresponding author), ARS, USDA, PWA, 2021 S Peach Ave, Fresno, CA 93727 USA.","bryla@spininternet.com","Bouma, Tjeerd J/A-9841-2011; Eissenstat, David/AAE-2793-2020","Bryla, David/0000-0002-9908-5993","","","",NA,"55","80","90","1","37","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0140-7791","1365-3040","","PLANT CELL ENVIRON","Plant Cell Environ.","AUG","2001","24","8","",NA,"",NA,"781","790","","10.1046/j.1365-3040.2001.00723.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2001.00723.x","","","10","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","462CB",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000170401600003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This temperature-dependent development phenomenon has been known as the Kaufmann effect. However, its theoretical analysis has not yet been successfully carried out owing to the insufficiency of mathematical insight especially into quantitative expressions. In insect development, the interrelationships among the three environmental temperatures, namely, the constant and alternating temperatures controlled in the laboratory and the hourly fluctuating temperatures in the natural environment, have not been clarified. Here, we completely succeeded in analyzing this phenomenon and in elucidating the interrelationships by introducing the components of the nonlinear SSI development model, the second derivative, the cosine-wave model of hourly fluctuating temperatures and their variance, and Taylor series. As a result, it has been possible to predict the development rate at fluctuating temperatures in the natural environment using prospective daily maximum, minimum and average temperatures and the development rate at constant temperatures without conducting experiments at alternating temperatures.","[Ikemoto, Takaya] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Tokyo 1738605, Japan; [Egami, Chikahiro] Numazu Natl Coll Technol, Dept Digital Engn, Shizuoka 4108501, Japan","Teikyo University","Ikemoto, T (corresponding author), Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol, Tokyo 1738605, Japan.","ikemotot@js2.so-net.ne.jp; egami@numazu-ct.ac.jp","","","","","",NA,"25","12","12","0","16","SPRINGER JAPAN KK","TOKYO","CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN","0003-6862","","","APPL ENTOMOL ZOOL","Appl.

To better understand these changes across long temporal scales, the present study used dendroclimatological techniques to assess variations in MWT in Southwestern China. Using data from Rhododendron species distributed in areas above the tree-line, a regional composite chronology was generated for a 341-year period. Based on the significant negative correlation between MWT values and ring-width, the most reliable parts of this chronological data were then used to reconstruct MWT values for the past 211 years. This reconstructed MWT series showed decadal to multi-decadal fluctuations. Three distinct cold periods prevailed during 1823-1858, 1882-1891 and 1922-1965, while four warm intervals occurred in 1800-1822, 1858-1881, 1892-1921 and 1966-2011. Our reconstructed MWT reveals a warming trend over the most recent eight decades, which is in agreement with instrumental observations. However, the MWT values and rate of warming over the past seven decades did not exceed those found in the reconstructed temperature data for the past 211 years. Spatial correlations reveal that the MWT in Southwest China is strongly associated with regional temperatures in the Eastern and Central Himalaya, Northern China, and the Indian Peninsula. Larger scale climate oscillations of the Western Pacific and Northern Indian Ocean as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation probably influenced the region's temperature in the past.","[Bi, Yingfeng; Xu, Jianchu; Yang, Yang; Yang, Yongping; Yang, Xuefei] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Bi, Yingfeng; Xu, Jianchu; Zhang, Shibao; Yang, Xuefei] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Econ Plants & Biotechnol, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Bi, Yingfeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Bi, Yingfeng; Xu, Jianchu; Zhang, Shibao; Yang, Xuefei] Yunnan Key Lab Wild Plant Resources, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Xu, Jianchu] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jinchao] Southwest Forestry Univ, Kunming 650224, Peoples R China; [Li, Zongshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Gebrekirstos, Aster] World Agroforestry Ctr ICRAF, UN Ave, Nairobi 00100, Kenya; [Liang, Eryuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xuefei] Chinese Acad Sci, Southeast Asia Biodivers Res Inst, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Southwest Forestry University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES); CGIAR; World Agroforestry (ICRAF); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Yang, XF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Plant Divers & Biogeog East Asia, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China.;Yang, XF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Econ Plants & Biotechnol, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China.;Yang, XF (corresponding author), Yunnan Key Lab Wild Plant Resources, Kunming 650201, Peoples R China.;Yang, XF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Southeast Asia Biodivers Res Inst, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China.","xuefei@mail.kib.ac.cn","Liang, Eryuan/A-1435-2010; Bi, Yingfeng/AAO-8544-2020; Yang, Xuefei/G-5656-2012; Xu, Jianchu/Y-2890-2019","Liang, Eryuan/0000-0002-8003-4264; Yang, Xuefei/0000-0002-0986-2745; ","Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-EW-J-24]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31370513, 31270524]; Southeast Asia Biodiversity Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences [2015CASEABRIRG001]","Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Southeast Asia Biodiversity Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Independent Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. KSCX2-EW-J-24), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31370513 and 31270524), and Southeast Asia Biodiversity Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2015CASEABRIRG001).

It was shown that acclimation at 20 degrees C for 6 days allowed to maintain better nitrification activity at 10 degrees C. The nitrite oxidation capacity of nitrifiers was significantly correlated with the relative light unit (RLU) (p<.05) and the fluctuation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity (p<.01). With serial #3 showed the highest RLU levels and the least SOD enzyme fluctuation as compared to serials #2 and #4. Throughout the experimental period, Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas as well as Nitrospira were identified as the predominant ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrate-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). The dynamic change of AOB/NOB ratios and nitrification activity in serials #2-#4 demonstrated that AOB recovered better than NOB with long-term 10 degrees C exposure, and the nitrification performance was mainly limited by the nitrite oxidation capacity of NOB. Applying 6 days acclimation at 20 degrees C was beneficial for the mixed nitrifying bacteria culture to cope with low temperature (10 degrees C) stress, possibly due to the maintenance of metabolic activity, antioxidant enzyme activity stability as well as appropriate AOB/NOB ratio.

Two endogenous factors, worker longevity and queen's daily egg production, are known to determine maximum colony size. A third endogenous factor, duration of worker development from egg to adult, regulates the rate of colony growth. In this paper, we report findings from a simulation quantifying the effects of temperature on colony size in the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. The monthly average temperature over a six year period for the panhandle of north Florida was interpolated to determine the effects of daily temperature on a queen's egg production, worker developmental time and worker longevity. Additional daily temperatures were simulated: 7 degrees C higher and 7 degrees C lower than daily temperatures for north Florida. As expected, colony size was the largest when annual temperatures were the highest across seasons, ranging from 57,000 to 187,000. Colony size at intermediate daily temperatures ranged from 14,000 to 103,000; small colonies recovered rapidly as temperatures warmed. Colony size at lower daily temperatures ranged from 14,000 to 21,000. Extended worker longevity at lower temperatures compensated for low egg production and longer developmental time. And vice versa, the queen's high rate of egg production and the shorter developmental time compensated for shorter worker longevity at high temperatures. Because the fire ant nest consists of a heat-collecting dome in which to incubate brood during cold weather, and deep chambers in which to cool workers during hot weather, colony size is likely to be higher and more stable than our simulation showed. The extended longevity of workers and queens at low temperatures, and perhaps their ability to hibernate below the permafrost, might explain the ability of ants to colonize habitats worldwide.

Arcto-Norwegian cod (AC, the main commercial cod stock which spawn in Lofoten and are distributed in the Barents Sea, mostly north of 70 degrees N), were compared with a nearby coastal stock (Balsfjord cod, BC - from a fjord near Tromso at 69 degrees 30'N), and a more southern coastal cod stock (CC, from near Bergen at 60 degrees N). The increment width series of the lapillus - otolith growth history - and the relative daily growth rate were not significantly different among stocks within any mesocosm. Although AC larvae were larger, being derived from larger brood stock, they did not exhibit consistently greater otolith growth during the experiment. Larger size at harvest was correlated with growth during the latter part of rearing (>fourth week), which is when most differences in size at age are generated. Decreases in daily increment widths occurred in all stocks within 1-2 days, when the zooplankton food supply was changed from nauplii and copepodites to adult copepods, and when the average AC cod began to exhibit greater dairy growth. Increment widths of reared AC cod at 37 days post hatch (>8 mu m) were 2-3 times greater, and ontogenetically more variable than those of similar sized cod previously sampled from the Barents Sea (3-4 mu m). Average otolith growth histories of pelagic juvenile cod reveal a substantial range in growth potential that is not apparent from more conservative comparisons of weight, and reveal a temporal sensitivity useful for the assessment of environmental fluctuations in the rearing process.

Iris pseudacorus, an emergent macrophyte, has established invasive populations across a broad global range, and reduces biodiversity in wetland ecosystems. Climate change is altering germination cues, yet studies on the invasion of wetland macrophytes often ignore germination ecology despite its importance to their establishment and spread. Methods We explored germination of seeds from invasive I. pseudacorus populations in California in response to seed coat presence or absence, and several environmental factors. Using experimental results in a thermal time model, we derived germination temperature thresholds. Results Germination of I. pseudacorus seeds did not require cold or warm stratification, and was not affected by seed coat presence or absence. Germination occurred in the dark, although germinability was two- to threefold times greater under light. At constant temperature, thermal time model estimates included 18.3 +/- 1.8 degrees C base germination temperature ( T b $({T}_{b}$); 28.2 +/- 0.5 degrees C optimal temperature ( T o $({T}_{o}$); and 41.0 +/- 1.7 degrees C ceiling temperature ( T c $({T}_{c}$). Seeds exposed to 36.0 degrees C achieved over 10% germination, and embryos of ungerminated seeds presented 76% viability. Overall, germinability remained relatively low at constant temperatures (<= 25%) but was close to 90% under alternating daily temperatures. Conclusions Exposure to diurnally fluctuating temperatures is essential for this species to achieve high germination rates. Our study reveals that I. pseudacorus has a broad germination niche supporting its establishment in a relatively wide range of environments, including at high temperatures more frequent with climate change.","[Gillard, Morgane B.; Futrell, Caryn J.; Grewell, Brenda J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci MS 4, USDA ARS, Invas Species & Pollinator Hlth Res Unit, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Castillo, Jesus M.] Univ Seville, Dept Biol Vegetal & Ecol, Seville 41080, Spain; [Mesgaran, Mohsen B.; Grewell, Brenda J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci MS 4, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Sevilla; University of California System; University of California Davis","Grewell, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci MS 4, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","bjgrewell@ucdavis.edu","","","USDA-ARS","USDA-ARS(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)USDA Agricultural Research Service)","The authors thank Rebecca Drenovksy, the editors, and two anonymous reviewers for suggestions that improved our manuscript.

To test this empirically we transformed rice to possess higher (overexpressors, OE) and lower (RNA interference, RNAi) levels of expression of the regulatory psbS gene and analysed CO2 assimilation in transformants in a fluctuating measurement light regime. Western blots showed a several-fold difference in levels of PsbS protein between RNAi and OE plants with the wild type (WT) being intermediate. At a growth light intensity of 600 mu mol m-2 sec-1, the carboxylation capacity, electron transport capacity and dark adapted Fv/Fm (ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence) were inhibited in RNAi plants compared with WT and OE. The PsbS content had a significant impact on qE (measured here as non-photochemical quenching, NPQ) but the strongest effect was observed transiently, immediately following the application of light. This capacity for qE was several-fold lower in RNAi plants and significantly higher in OE plants during the first 10 min of illumination. At steady state the differences were reduced: notably at 500 mu mol m-2 sec-1 all plants had the same NPQ values regardless of PsbS content. During a series of lightdark transitions the induction of CO2 assimilation was inhibited in OE plants, reducing integrated photosynthesis during the light period. We conclude that the accumulation of PsbS and the resultant qE exerts control over photosynthesis in fluctuating light, showing that optimization of photoprotective processes is necessary for maximum photosynthetic productivity even in the absence of photoinhibitory stress.","[Hubbart, Stella; Ajigboye, Olubukola O.; Murchie, Erik H.] Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Div Plant & Crop Sci, Nottingham LE12 5RD, England; [Horton, Peter] Univ Sheffield, Dept Mol Biol & Biotechnol, Western Bank, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England","University of Nottingham; University of Sheffield","Murchie, EH (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Biosci, Div Plant & Crop Sci, Sutton Bonington Campus, Nottingham LE12 5RD, England.","erik.murchie@nottingham.ac.uk","Ajigboye, Olubukola/L-8336-2016; Horton, Peter/A-3958-2012; Murchie, Erik h/G-4074-2013; Murchie, Erik/AGU-8921-2022","Horton, Peter/0000-0002-6095-1460; Murchie, Erik h/0000-0002-7465-845X; Murchie, Erik/0000-0002-7465-845X; Ajigboye, Olubukola/0000-0001-7924-7978; Edwards, Stella/0000-0002-9286-154X","(UK) Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/G003157/1]; BBSRC [BB/G003157/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BB/G003157/1] Funding Source: researchfish","(UK) Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); BBSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","We thank Syngenta USA for producing the transgenic rice plants and providing seed and for their strong support.

The average annual temperature of the Earth's surface is expected to increase, as is the frequency of hot days. In this review, we explore what effects short-term and long-term changes in temperature are likely to have on root respiratory metabolism, and what impacts such changes will have on daily, seasonal and annual CO2 release by roots under field conditions. We demonstrate that Q(10) values, and the degree of acclimation, differ between and within plant species. Changes in the temperature sensitivity of respiration with measuring temperature are highlighted. Temperature-dependent changes in adenylate control and substrate supply are likely to control the Q(10) and degree of acclimation of root respiration. Limitations in respiration capacity are unlikely to control respiratory Aux at most temperatures. The potential role of nonphosphorylating pathways such as the alternative oxidase in controlling Q(10) values is highlighted. The possibility that potentially rapid changes in adenylate control might underlie the acclimation response (rather than slow changes in enzyme capacity) has implications for the total amount of CO2 respired by roots daily and annually. Our modelling suggests that rapid acclimation will result in near-perfect homeostasis of respiration rates and minimize annual CO2 release. However, annual CO2 release increases substantially if the speed of full acclimation is lower. Our modelling exercise also shows that high Q(10) values have the potential to increase daily and annual CO2 release substantially, particularly if the frequency of hot days increases after global warming.","Univ York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England","University of York - UK","Atkin, OK (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Biol, POB 373, York YO10 5YW, N Yorkshire, England.","oka1@york.ac.uk","Atkin, Owen K/C-8415-2009; Atkin, Owen/O-2671-2019; Edwards, Everard/B-3132-2008; Loveys, Beth/Q-9863-2016","Atkin, Owen K/0000-0003-1041-5202; Atkin, Owen/0000-0003-1041-5202; Edwards, Everard/0000-0003-2718-2329; Loveys, Beth/0000-0002-2571-2747","","","",NA,"75","311","373","12","188","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0028-646X","1469-8137","","NEW PHYTOL","New Phytol.","JUL","2000","147","1","",NA,"",NA,"141","154","","10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00683.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00683.x","","","14","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","341EK",NA,"Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000088577900012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Changes in climatic conditions critically influence fruit splitting incidence. We studied plant-soil-ambient water relations in splitting-prone citrus grown under 4 contrasting environmental conditions (climate type and soil), in Spain and Uruguay, over a six years period. Automatic trunk and fruit diameter measurements (trunk and fruit growth rate and maximum daily trunk shrinkage), which are a tree water status indicator, together with factors modifying the tree and fruit water relationship (temperature, ET, rainfall, soil texture, soil moisture, rootstock and xylem anatomy) were studied and correlated with splitting. A close fruit splitting and soil texture relationship was found, inversely correlated with clay and silt percentages, and positively with those for sand. Under 85%-sand soil conditions, slight changes in soil moisture due to fluctuations in temperature, ET, or rainfall changed trunk and fruit growth rate patterns during few hours and induced splitting. Splitting incidence was higher in trees with larger xylem vessels in the fruit peduncle due to rootstock ('Carrizo' and 'C-35' citrange being higher than 'FA-5', 'Cleopatra' and Poncirus trifoliata). Finally, reducing the frequency of irrigation by half increased midday canopy temperatures (similar to 5 degrees C) and splitting (+15%). We conclude that irregularities in the tree water status, due to interactions among soil moisture, rootstock and climatic conditions, leads to a number of substantial changes in fruit growth rate increasing the incidence of fruit splitting.

The reliability of this model has been validated through the comparisons of simulated and measured water wall temperatures along different dimensions in the furnace of reference USC boiler. Then, the effect of flame offset on water wall tube temperature in 600 degrees C and 700 degrees C USC boilers was investigated by importing the flame offset variables into the coupled model. The water wall temperature distribution is significantly influenced by flame offset, and both the fluctuation and growth rate of temperature are increased with the ascent of flame offset distance, especially on the furnace walls that flame deviates toward. The radiative and convective heat flux to water walls is strengthened simultaneously during the flame offset process, resulting in the local overheating of water wall. In the 600 degrees C USC boilers, when the distance of flame offset exceeds 5 m, multiple peak distribution of wall temperatures appears, which can increase the burst risk of water wall tubes because of shear stress inside the tube material. The maximal distance of flame offset should be limited to 3 m to avoid the tube burst accidents. In the 700 degrees C USC unit, the variation tendency of water wall temperature is resemble with that in 600 degrees C USC unit, but the fluctuation of wall temperature is larger. As the flame offset distance approaches 3 m, the maximal water wall temperature reaches 595 degrees C, which greatly exceeds the material allowable temperature in the 600 degrees C USC unit. The material of water wall tubes with allowable temperature of 605 degrees C is recommended for the 700 degrees C USC unit. Based on the thermal security of metal material, the maximal distance of flame offset should be yielded to 2 m.","[Dong, Jiancong; Fan, Haojie; Zhang, Jian; Zhang, Zhongxiao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiaojiang] Shanghai Boiler Works Co Ltd, Dept Res & Dev, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tuo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Engn Thermophys, Beijing, Peoples R China","Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Engineering Thermophysics, CAS","Zhang, ZX (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.","zhzhx222@163.com","","","National Key Research & Development Program of China [2017YFB0602102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1361201]","National Key Research & Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was financially supported by the National Key Research & Development Program of China [Grant No.: 2017YFB0602102] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No.: U1361201].",NA,"31","10","10","2","36","TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","0010-2202","1563-521X","","COMBUST SCI TECHNOL","Combust.

Yet considering regional variation in response to climate is necessary to better predict the consequences of climate change on pest population dynamics and associated damage. We investigated the climatic drivers of demographic fluctuations in a forest tree defoliator, the pine pro cessionary moth (PPM), in 8 biogeographical regions in France. We studied the effects of precipitation and temperature for both cold and warm periods, in accordance with PPM biology. We trained second-order log linear models of infestation dynamics based on records spanning over 32 years (1981-2014) and 1239 forest plots, and tested their forecast accuracy on two additional years (2013-2014). PPM population growth rate decreased with higher precipitations in 5 regions and increased with increasing temperatures in the cold period in 4 regions. The magnitude and direction of temperature effects in the warm period varied among biogeographical regions. Our results also revealed that PPM population dynamics were largely triggered by density-dependent factors independent from climatic drivers. Short-term forecasts were generally accurate irrespective of the inclusion of climatic variables into the models. To better predict the consequences of climate change on insect population dynamics, it is advisable to take geographical variability of species response into account and develop regional forecasting models.","[Toigo, Maude; Jactel, Herve] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, Biogeco, F-33610 Cestas, France; [Barraquand, Frederic] Univ Bordeaux, Integrat & Theoret Ecol Chair, LabEx COTE, F-33615 Pessac, France; [Barnagaud, Jean-Yves] PSL Res Univ, CNRS, Biogeog & Ecol Vertebres, CEFE,EPHE,UM,SupAgro,IND,INRA,UMR5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier, France; [Piou, Dominique] DGAL SDQSPV, Minist Agr Agroalimentaire & Fork, Dept Sante Forets, 252 Rue Vaugirard, F-75732 Paris, France","INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite de Bordeaux; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); INRAE; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier","Jactel, H (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, INRA, Biogeco, F-33610 Cestas, France.","herve.jactel@inra.fr","Barraquand, Frédéric/G-1599-2011","Barraquand, Frédéric/0000-0002-4759-0269","Center for Informatics Research on Complexity in Ecology (CIRCE) - Aarhus University Research Foundation (Denmark) under the AU Ideas program","Center for Informatics Research on Complexity in Ecology (CIRCE) - Aarhus University Research Foundation (Denmark) under the AU Ideas program","This work was founded by the French Department of Forest Health (Ministry of Agriculture) and the Regional council of Aquitaine and received partial support from the Center for Informatics Research on Complexity in Ecology (CIRCE), funded by the Aarhus University Research Foundation (Denmark) under the AU Ideas program.

Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) eggs and larvae occurred predominantly above the salt front where conductivity was less than or equal to 800 mu mhos cm(-1). There were three prominent peaks in egg production, each coinciding with increasing temperatures. Estimated growth rates of 6-d, otolith-aged cohorts, which ranged from 0.15 mm d(-1) to 0.22 mm d(-1) (mean = 0.17 mm d(-1)), were not demonstrated to differ significantly from each other. Observed zooplankton densities and temperature did not significantly affect growth rates. Stage-specific cumulative mortalities of combined cohorts were calculated for eggs (Z(stage) = 0.20 = 18.1%), yolk-sac larvae (Z(stage) = 5.80 = 99.7%), and first-feeding larvae (Z(stage) = 2.95 = 94.8%). The very high mortality of yolk-sac larvae suggests that dynamics during this stage may have had a major impact on subsequent recruitment. Cohort-specific mortality rates of larvae were variable, ranging from Z = 0.045 d(-1) to 0.719 d(-1), and were strongly temperature-dependent. Cohorts that experienced average temperatures <15 degrees C or >20 degrees C during the first 25 d after hatching had significantly higher mortality rates than those which experienced intermediate temperatures. Estimated hatch-date frequencies of larvae greater than or equal to 8 mm SL indicated good, very good, and very low potential recruitments for cohorts spawned during early-season (April 2-11), mid-season (April 12-24) and late-season (April 25-May 5), respectively. Because seasonal temperature trends and fluctuations are unpredictable, striped bass females cannot select a spawning time that guarantees their offspring will be exposed to optimum temperatures. Consequently, selection may have occurred for spawning over a broad range of temperatures and dates, a behavior insuring that some larval cohorts will encounter favorable temperatures.","","","SECOR, DH (corresponding author), UNIV MARYLAND SYST,CTR ENVIRONM & ESTUARINE STUDIES,CHESAPEAKE BIOL LAB,SOLOMONS,MD 20688, USA.","","Secor, David H./D-4367-2012; Houde, Edward/D-8498-2012","Secor, David H./0000-0001-6007-4827; ","","","",NA,"44","111","112","0","21","ESTUARINE RES FEDERATION","LAWRENCE","PO BOX 368, LAWRENCE, KS 66044","0160-8347","","","ESTUARIES","Estuaries","SEP","1995","18","3","",NA,"",NA,"527","544","","10.2307/1352370","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1352370","","","18","Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology","RV913",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1995RV91300009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These plants survive through different adaptations to respond to adverse environmental conditions. Despite this capability, it is unknown how CAM photosynthetic activity and growth in Opuntia plantlets is affected by constant heat or cold. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to evaluate the short-term effect of high (40 degrees C) and low (4 degrees C) continuous temperatures on the photosynthetic efficiency, the organic acid content (malic acid) and the relative growth rate (RGR) in seven-month-old Opuntia streptacantha plantlets during 5, 10, and 15 days. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis allowed us to determine that high temperatures negatively impact the photosynthetic efficiency of O. streptacantha plantlets, which exhibited the lowest values of maximum quantum efficiency of the photosystem II (F-v/F-m = 52%, F-v/F-0 = 85%), operational quantum yield of PS (phi(PSII) = 65%) and relative electron transport rate (rETR = 65%), as well as highest values of basal fluorescence (F-0 = 226%) during 15 days of treatment. Similarly, low temperatures decreased Fv/Fm (16%), F-v/F-0 (50%), phi(PSII) and rETR (16%). High temperatures also decreased nocturnal acidification in approximately 34-50%, whereas low temperatures increased it by 30-36%. Additionally, both continuous temperatures affected drastically diurnal consumption of malic acid, which was related to a significant RGR inhibition, where the specific photosynthetic structure area component was the most affected. Our results allowed determining that, despite the high tolerance to extreme temperatures described for Opuntia plants, young individuals of O. streptacantha suffered photosynthetic impairment that led to the inhibition of their growth. Thus, the main findings reported in this study can help to predict the potential impact of climatic change on the establishment and survival of succulent species of arid and semiarid regions of Mexico.","[Zarely Ojeda-Perez, Zaida; Delgado-Sanchez, Pablo] Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Lab Biotecnol, Fac Agron & Vet, Soledad De Graciano Sanc, Slp, Mexico; [Zarely Ojeda-Perez, Zaida] Univ Pedag Tecnol & Colombia, Sede Cent, Lab Cultivo Tejidos Vegetales Bioplasma, Escuela Ciencias Biol,Fac Ciencias Basicas, Tunja, Boyaca, Colombia; [Francisco Jimenez-Bremont, Juan] Inst Potosino Invest Cient & Tecnol AC, Lab Biol Mol Hongos & Plantas, Div Biol Mol, San Luis Potosi, Slp, Mexico","Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi; Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia (UPTC); Instituto Potosino Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica","Delgado-Sanchez, P (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Lab Biotecnol, Fac Agron & Vet, Soledad De Graciano Sanc, Slp, Mexico.","pablo.delgado@uaslp.mx","Jiménez Bremont, Juan Francisco/CAF-4866-2022; Delgado-Sánchez, Pablo/AAV-3840-2021; Jiménez Bremont, Juan Francisco/CAI-1278-2022; Jiménez Bremont, Juan Francisco/C-9256-2011; Ojeda Perez, Zaida Zarely/B-1003-2015","Jiménez Bremont, Juan Francisco/0000-0001-6230-0250; Jiménez Bremont, Juan Francisco/0000-0001-6230-0250; Jiménez Bremont, Juan Francisco/0000-0001-6230-0250; Ojeda Perez, Zaida Zarely/0000-0003-1630-6699; Delgado-Sanchez, Pablo/0000-0003-2560-871X","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia-Fondo Ciencia Basica [179982, 382480]","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia-Fondo Ciencia Basica","This study was supported by the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia-Fondo Ciencia Basica (No. 179982 to Pablo Delgado Sanchez) and PhD student grant (No. 382480 to Zaida Zarely Ojeda Perez).",NA,"61","17","18","2","15","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","OCT 23","2017","12","10","",NA,"",NA,"","","e0186540","10.1371/journal.pone.0186540","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186540","","","18","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","FK3RE","29059203","Green Submitted, Green Published, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000413403000030","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The aim of this study was to determine the thermal requirements for aphid development and to assess its performance on six grapevine cultivars of economic importance in Greece. The grapevine aphid was reared at four constant temperatures (17 - 26 degrees C) on 'Soultanina' and 'Agiorgitiko' cultivars and the thermal summation method was applied to estimate the lower developmental thresholds and the thermal constants in each cultivar. In addition, age-specific life tables were constructed and population growth parameters on cultivars 'Soultanina', 'Savvatiano', 'Moscato Bianco', 'Agiorgitiko', 'Mavrodafni' and 'Merlot' were estimated at 23 degrees C. Our data revealed that aphids develop faster with increasing temperatures within the 17 - 26 degrees C range on both cultivars. The theoretical lower developmental threshold was 4.2 degrees C and 5.4 degrees C and 110.9 and 104.1 day-degrees were required for aphids to reach adulthood on 'Soultanina' and 'Agiorgitiko', respectively. Mean adult longevity and mean post-reproductive period varied significantly among cultivars. Aphids lived significantly longer on 'Savvatiano' than on 'Moscato Bianco', 'Soultanina' and 'Mavrodafni', and the longest post-reproductive period were recorded for aphids reared on 'Savvatiano', 'Agiorgitiko' and 'Merlot'. However, mortality and developmental rates, mean lifetime fecundity and population growth parameters didn't differ significantly among grapevine cultivars. Overall, our data showed that all examined cultivars are suitable hosts for the aphid.

The damage potential of Tribolium castaneum in wheat grains stored in different storage bags at various storage periods was studied. A highly significant effect (P < 0.01) of the storage bags and storage periods was observed in variables measured (insect growth rate, damaged grains, grain weight loss and weight of insect feeding residues). The maximum mean insect growth rate (85.20 +/- 2.80), percent damaged wheat grains (73.24 +/- 0.17%), percent grain weight loss (21.14 +/- 0.21%) and weight of insect feeding residues (2.15 +/- 0.01 g) were recorded in wheat grains stored in cotton cloth bag at 150 d, whereas minimum mean insect growth rate (30.00 +/- 0.00), percent damaged wheat grains (10.44 +/- 0.16%), percent grain weight loss (0.82 +/- 0.06%) and weight of insect feeding residues (0.22 +/- 0.02 g) were recorded on wheat grains stored in hermetic bag due to 100% mortality of T. castaneum in hermetic bag at 30 d. A significant and positive correlation between storage periods, insect growth rate, damaged wheat grains, grain weight loss and weight of insect feeding residues was observed, except for the storage bags which were significantly and negatively correlated with other factors. In addition, the simple and linear regressions analysis were significant (P < 0.01), and all the equations for these analyses were fitted for the regression models and perfectly described the association between the dependent and independent variables. Hermetic bag proved resistance to external environment fluctuations in abiotic factors such as temperature and relative humidity. While grain moisture in all other bags fluctuated with external environment. The results showed that quantitative and qualitative losses of stored wheat grains depends not only the type of storage bags, but also on the storage periods. T. castaneum can have a negative impact on wheat grains stored in all storage bags except hermetic bag.

Season and daily temperature fluctuations are observed in glasshouse crop production. The sensitivity of crops to the presence of urea or ammonium in the root zone depends on: 1- temperature of the root. 2- Rate and amount of sugar flow from the leaves to the roots. The ammonium N is metabolized in the root cells and produces NH3 (ammonia) that require the presence of sugar to neutralize it. The sugar in the cell is used for binding ammonia in the production of glutamate or glutamine. When sugar in the cell is depleted due to excess respiration or shortage of light, ammonia reacts as a respiration poison and the cell dies in few seconds. There are differences between plants in their sensitivity to the concentration of ammonium in the nutrient solution. Corn, rice, and sorghum, are not sensitive to the presence of ammonium in the root zone up to 5 mM N-NH4 in the solution, while tomato, lettuce, Chinese cabbage, and spinach, are very sensitive. In strawberries the sugar content in the root decreased with the increase of root temperature until root death was observed at 32 degrees C. Root temperature of potted plants, (when not controlled in glasshouse production), might quickly rise during the day. Fine roots are the first to die due to ammonium toxicity. Root temperature and external concentration of ammonium in the solution are the major factors in determining the plant sensitivity to the form of N fertilizer in the root media. The implications of this mechanism on the type of fertilizer selection in glasshouse crop production will be discussed.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Agr, Robert H Smith Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Hebrew University of Jerusalem","Kafkafi, U (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Fac Agr, Robert H Smith Inst Plant Sci & Genet Agr, POB 12, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.","","","","","","",NA,"23","1","1","0","10","INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE","LEUVEN 1","PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM","0567-7572","2406-6168","978-90-6605-731-9","ACTA HORTIC","","","2009","807","","",NA,"",NA,"321","325","","","","","","5","Horticulture","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Agriculture","BAR82",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000305334500044","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, these microalgal-based processes are challenging since daily and seasonal temperature fluctuation may affect microalgal growth in wastewater, and the effects of the temperature regimes on microalgal biomass production and wastewater nutrient removal remain unclear. In this study, Chlorella vulgaris was continuously cultured for 15 days in municipal wastewater to investigate the effects on the algal biomass and wastewater nutrient removal in three temperature regimes: (1) low temperature (4 degrees C), (2) high temperature (35 degrees C), and (3) alternating high-low temperature (35 degrees C in the day: 4 degrees C at night). Compared with the other two temperature regimes, the high-low temperature conditions generated the most biomass (1.62 g L-1), the highest biomass production rate (99.21 mg L-1 day(-1)), and most efficient removal of COD, TN, NH3-N, and TP (83.0%, 96.5%, 97.8%, and 99.2%, respectively). In addition, the polysaccharides, proteins, lipid content, and fatty acid methyl ester composition analysis indicates that in alternating high-low temperature condition, biomass production increased the potential for biofuel production, and there was the highest lipid content (26.4% of total dry biomass). The results showed that the nutrients except COD were all efficiently removed in these temperature conditions, and the alternating high-low temperature condition showed great potential to generate algal biomass and alleviate the wastewater nutrients. This study provides some valuable information for large-scale algal cultivation in wastewater and microalgal-based wastewater treatments.","[Xu, Kaiwei; Zou, Xiaotong; Wen, Hao; Xue, Yating; Qu, Yanhui; Li, Yanpeng] Changan Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Yanta Rd 126, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanpeng] Minist Educ, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Arid Areas, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanpeng] Shaanxi Key Lab Land Consolidat, Xian 710075, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Chang'an University","Li, YP (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Yanta Rd 126, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Li, YP (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Arid Areas, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Li, YP (corresponding author), Shaanxi Key Lab Land Consolidat, Xian 710075, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.","liyanp01@chd.edu.cn","Xu, Kaiwei/AAI-1164-2019","Li, Yanpeng/0000-0001-5802-680X","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51478045]; Key Laboratory of Degraded and Unused Land Consolidation Engineering of the Ministry of Land and Resources of China [SXDJ2017-6]; Fund Project of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Land Consolidation [2018-ZD04]; Special Fund for Basic Scientific Research of Central Colleges, Chang'an University [300102299703, 300102299708]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Laboratory of Degraded and Unused Land Consolidation Engineering of the Ministry of Land and Resources of China; Fund Project of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Land Consolidation; Special Fund for Basic Scientific Research of Central Colleges, Chang'an University","The authors would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51478045), Key Laboratory of Degraded and Unused Land Consolidation Engineering of the Ministry of Land and Resources of China (SXDJ2017-6), supported by the Fund Project of Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Land Consolidation (2018-ZD04), and the Special Fund for Basic Scientific Research of Central Colleges, Chang'an University (300102299703 and 300102299708) for funding this project.",NA,"51","17","17","10","72","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0175-7598","1432-0614","","APPL MICROBIOL BIOT","Appl.

We tested the recently suggested hypotheses that pre-existing, long-lived leaves should exhibit a relatively limited ability for R to acclimate to climate warming, and that acclimation would occur via changes in the short-term temperature sensitivity of respiration. Seedlings of a subalpine, evergreen tree species (Eucalyptus pauciflora) were grown under naturally fluctuating conditions within its natural distribution. We used a free air temperature increase (FATI) system of infra-red ceramic lamps to raise night-time leaf temperatures by 0.3 +/- 0.1, 1.3 +/- 0.1, and 2.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C above ambient for 1 year. Light-saturated assimilation rates and plant growth did not change with nocturnal FATI treatments. Leaf R measured at prevailing temperatures did not differ between FATI treatments. Within each FATI treatment, nocturnal leaf R was highly sensitive to artificial temperature changes within minutes, and also correlated strongly with natural nocturnal and seasonal temperature variation. The corresponding values of Q(10) of R varied according to time scale of measurements, but did not vary between FATI treatments.

We studied population dynamics of Mongolian gerbils under semi-natural conditions using monthly live trapping from 2001 to 2004 in south-central Inner Mongolia. Mongolian gerbils displayed seasonal fluctuations of density and population growth rate. Reproduction and recruitment of gerbils occurred primarily from March-August with a breeding lull in autumn. Population growth rates of Mongolian gerbils were not related to population density but were negatively related to temperature and precipitation. Enhanced reproductive performance and success of females increased population growth of gerbils in our enclosure. We also found that increased temperature and precipitation during the plant growing season negatively affected recruitment and rate of pregnancy. Mongolian gerbils prefer habitats with short, sparse vegetation and dry, loose and sandy soil. Increases in temperature and rainfall enhance vegetation growth; consequently, tall, dense and moist vegetation might reduce the suitability of habitats and retard population growth of Mongolian gerbils. Pronounced seasonal climatic fluctuations in northern latitudes may be the main cause of seasonal population dynamics of Mongolian gerbils. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, climate change is predicted to threaten peatland C sink function through rising temperatures, lowered water tables and the expansion of vascular plants. Here, by selecting four peatland habitats differing in their dominant plant communities and abiotic conditions, we investigated the influence of the most relevant climatic factors (namely temperature and soil water content) in controlling the spatial and temporal responses of soil organisms and their potential links to above-ground plant functional diversity. We found that the soil mesofaunal communities under vascular plants were mainly dominated by microarthropods (oribatid mites and collembolans), and contrasted with those under mosses that consisted of enchytreids and dipterans (approximate to 15% dissimilarity). We show that the balance of tolerance to drought and saturation determined the temporal dynamics and vertical stratification of the soil invertebrate populations. From this, we anticipate that the projected expansion of vascular plants not only will displace active peat forming vegetation species (mosses), but also those invertebrates that are poorly adapted to the new environment (enchytraeids and dipteral larvae). Our findings indicate future peatland responses to environmental changes should take into account the habitat complexity above- and below-ground community structure) and the modulating effects of the abiotic environment.","[Juan-Ovejero, Raquel; Briones, Maria Jesus, I] Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Benito, Elena; Esther Barreal, Maria] Univ Vigo, Dept Biol Vegetal & Ciencias Suelo, Vigo 36310, Spain; [Rodeiro, Javier] Univ Vigo, Dept Lenguajes & Sistemas Informat, Orense 32004, Spain","Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo","Briones, MJI (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Ecol & Biol Anim, Vigo 36310, Spain.","mbriones@uvigo.es","Benito, Elena/C-9906-2012; , Rodeiro/AAB-4993-2019; Juan Ovejero, Raquel/ABF-3649-2021; Briones, Maria J.

Predicting the consequences of warming requires understanding how temperature affects ingestion (energy gain) and metabolism (energy loss). Here, we studied the temperature dependence of metabolism and ingestion in laboratory experiments with terrestrial arthropods (beetles and spiders). From this data, we calculated ingestion efficiencies (ingestion/metabolism) and per capita interaction strengths in the short and long term. Additionally, we investigated if and how body mass changes these temperature dependencies. For both predator groups, warming increased metabolic rates substantially, whereas temperature effects on ingestion rates were weak. Accordingly, the ingestion efficiency (the ratio of ingestion to metabolism) decreased in all treatments. This result has two possible consequences: on the one hand, it suggests that warming of natural ecosystems could increase intrinsic population stability, meaning less fluctuations in population density; on the other hand, decreasing ingestion efficiencies may also lead to higher extinction risks because of starvation. Additionally, predicted long-term per capita interaction strengths decreased with warming, which suggests an increase in perturbation stability of populations, i.e., a higher probability of returning to the same equilibrium density after a small perturbation. Together, these results suggest that warming has complex and potentially profound effects on predator-prey interactions and food-web stability.","[Rall, Bjoern C.; Vucic-Pestic, Olivera; Ehnes, Roswitha B.; Brose, Ulrich] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Biol, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany; [Emmerson, Mark] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Dept Zool Ecol & Plant Sci, Distillery Fields, Cork, Ireland; [Emmerson, Mark] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland","Technical University of Darmstadt; University College Cork; University College Cork","Rall, BC (corresponding author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Biol, Schnittspahnstr 10, D-64287 Darmstadt, Germany.","rall@bio.tu-darmstadt.de","Emmerson, Mark Charles/ABD-6274-2021; Rall, Björn C./G-1508-2013; Ehnes, Roswitha/HKE-6790-2023; Brose, Ulrich/I-3488-2014; Brose, Ulrich/AAT-7547-2020","Rall, Björn C./0000-0002-3191-8389; Brose, Ulrich/0000-0001-9156-583X; , Roswitha/0000-0003-2457-7130; Emmerson, Mark/0000-0003-1034-8572","German Research Foundation [BR 2315/1-1]","German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We thank Stefan Scheu, Gregor Kalinkat, Sonja Otto, Karsten von Berg, Sonia Kefi, and Amrei Binzer for help, suggestions and comments.

Rapid removal or eradication of invasive plants is desirable because of their severe ecological impact on local ecosystems. Seed germination is the main cause of its distribution and invasion. Understanding germination characteristics of S. alterniflora is critical for the prediction and early detection of its populations in new environments. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of salinity (0, 10 20, 30, and 40 g/L artificial seawater), temperature (15, 20, 25 degrees C for constant, and 15/25 degrees C for alternating), and seed immersion (5 ml and 40 ml medium) based on laboratory experiments to evaluate the physicochemical environmental factors that facilitate the germination of S. alterniflora seeds. The cumulative germination rate and mean germination time were significantly affected by temperature and salinity but not by immersion. Increased salinity gradually reduced the cumulative germination rate in all temperature and immersion conditions. The mean germination time tended to be prolonged with the salinity level. A constant temperature of 25 degrees C promoted higher seed germination compared to constant temperatures of 15 and 20 degrees C. Notably, alternating temperature between 15 and 25 degrees C induced a higher seed germination compared to other constant temperatures. In addition, alternating temperatures varied the mean germination time to facilitate sensitivity to salinity, indicating that temperature fluctuation is a key factor that stimulates seed germination of S. alterniflora. These results suggest that S. alterniflora seeds prefer gaps in vegetation canopies and a low depth of burial in soil. Further studies are needed to analyze prevention strategies for the eradication of this invasive species in Japan. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Soil water deficits can significantly reduce plant growth and development, directly impacting crop quantity and quality. Dendrometers are a plant-based tool that have shown potential to improve irrigation management in high-value woody perennial crops (e.g., trees and vines). A dendrometer continuously measures small fluctuations in stem diameter; this has been directly correlated to water stress measurements using traditional methods. While plant-based measures of water deficits are considered to be the best measures of water stress, current dendrometer methods are imprecise due to mechanical hysteresis and thermal expansion. The high-precision dendrometer created at the OPEnS Lab alleviates these key failure points using zero-thermal expansion carbon fiber, zero friction via a spring tensioning approach, and a linear magnetic encoder. In-lab tests and field deployments have validated device measurements and the execution of these pivotal qualities. Mass deployment of these automated dendrometers has the potential to provide a continuous record of water stress, providing valuable decision support for irrigation management.

In nature, factors such as temperature, humidity, CO2 partial pressure, and spectrum and intensity of irradiance often fluctuate. Whereas irradiance intensity is most influential and has been studied in detail, understanding of interactions with other factors is lacking. Methods We tested how photosynthetic induction after dark-light transitions was affected by CO2 partial pressure (20, 40, 80 Pa), leaf temperatures (15.5, 22.8, 30.5 degrees C), leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficits (VPDleaf-air; 0.5, 0.8, 1.6, 2.3 kPa) and blue irradiance (0-20 %) in tomato leaves ( Solanum lycopersicum). Key Results Rates of photosynthetic induction strongly increased with CO2 partial pressure, due to increased apparent Rubisco activation rates and reduced diffusional limitations. High leaf temperature produced slightly higher induction rates, and increased intrinsic water use efficiency and diffusional limitation. High VPDleaf-air slowed down induction rates and apparent Rubisco activation and (at 2.3 kPa) induced damped stomatal oscillations. Blue irradiance had no effect. Slower apparent Rubisco activation in elevated VPDleaf-air may be explained by low leaf internal CO2 partial pressure at the beginning of induction. Conclusions The environmental factors CO2 partial pressure, temperature and VPDleaf-air had significant impacts on rates of photosynthetic induction, as well as on underlying diffusional, carboxylation and electron transport processes. Furthermore, maximizing Rubisco activation rates would increase photosynthesis by at most 6-8 % in ambient CO2 partial pressure (across temperatures and humidities), while maximizing rates of stomatal opening would increase photosynthesis by at most 1-3 %.","[Kaiser, Elias; Harbinson, Jeremy; Heuvelink, Ep; Marcelis, Leo F.

Microalgae with high growth characteristics are more likely to originate from the local environment. However, to be commercially effective, in addition to high growth microalgae must also have high lipid productivities and contain the desired fatty acids for their intended use. We isolated microalgae from intertidal locations in South East Queensland, Australia with adverse or fluctuating conditions, as these may harbor more opportunistic strains with high lipid accumulation potential. Screening was based on a standard protocol using growth rate and lipid accumulation as well as prioritizing fatty acid profiles suitable for biodiesel or nutraceuticals. Using these criteria, an initial selection of over 50 local microalgae strains from brackish and sea water was reduced to 16 strains considered suitable for further investigation. Among these 16 strains, the ones most likely to be effective for biodiesel feedstock were Nitzschia sp. CP3a, Tetraselmis sp. M8, Cymbella sp.

On the other hand, despite its distribution in unstable and highly selective environments such as salt marshes, no data are available on its ecological adaptability or on its growth strategy. In an effort to fill these gaps, we performed three experiments in order to evaluate the effects of selected environmental abiotic factors on the seed germination of A. caerulescens. In the first experiment, we determined the effect of different temperatures, photoperiod regimes and salinity on the germination of 120 days old seeds. Secondly, we tested the germination behaviour of the seeds in relation to seed after-ripening time and salinity. The results showed that a temperature regime of 10/20 degrees C and a photothermoperiod of 12/12 h were optimal conditions for seed germination. Salinity affected the final germination rate and mean time to germination. Until 60 days of after-ripening, the seeds exhibited a primary dormancy state. Then, their germination performance was affected by seed after-ripening time and salinity. The data obtained in this study allow us to outline a fairly accurate picture of the ecological requirements of A. caerulescens during germination and of the degree of viability of its seeds at least in the first year of their life. The significant different susceptibility of the seeds to salinity leads to the conclusion that the spread of this species by seeds strongly depends on soil salinity fluctuations. Knowledge of optimal germination requirements could also be useful for the possible use of plant seeds as propagation material in restoration and biodiversity conservation programmes.","[Lombardi, Tiziana; Bedini, Stefano; Bertacchi, Andrea] Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Agroenvironm Sci, Via Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy","University of Pisa","Lombardi, T (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Agr Food & Agroenvironm Sci, Via Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.","tiziana.lombardi@unipi.it","Bedini, Stefano/AAF-4453-2020; Lombardi, Tiziana/ABI-5727-2020; BERTACCHI, ANDREA/ABF-6078-2021","Bedini, Stefano/0000-0002-3760-9894; Lombardi, Tiziana/0000-0003-0427-1820; BERTACCHI, ANDREA/0000-0002-3276-3876","University of Pisa","University of Pisa","This study was financially supported by grants from the University of Pisa.",NA,"47","7","7","1","4","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1211-9520","1874-9348","","FOLIA GEOBOT","Folia Geobot.","JUN","2019","54","1-2","",NA,"",NA,"115","124","","10.1007/s12224-019-09345-4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12224-019-09345-4","","","10","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","KH5ZZ",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000510731000011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We used population-based threshold models to establish the temperature, moisture and oxygen conditions for optimum germination of herbicide-resistant and -susceptible Echinochloa phyllopogon, a weed of temperate paddy rice, and applied them to predict emergence from field soil. We combined hydrothermal time for germination, accounting for within-population variation in base water potentials (Psi(b)), with thermal time for early seedling growth to predict the quantity and proportional size of the emergence flushes that constitute final recruitment. Emergence in field soils was reduced by moisture stress and flooding, especially for the resistant population. In all populations, germination rates increased between 9.5 and 31 degrees C, Psi(b) was <-1.0 MPa, and there was no sensitivity to oxygen supply. Synthesis and applications. Population-based threshold models produced physiologically meaningful germination parameters, which are useful in defining the environmental constraints to germination, and predicting Echinochloa phyllopogon germination and emergence in field soils.

During these extreme cold climatic conditions, plants have to survive severe heat stress conditions, even if they are being kept in greenhouses. The objective of this study was to investigate a heating system that can provide heat directly to the root zone instead of heating the entire greenhouse, which is a viable option to reduce energy consumption. Root zone heating could be an effective alternative for the sustainable development of plants during the winter. A novel type of root zone heating system was applied to evaluate the energy consumption during different greenhouse ambient temperature conditions, the effects of root zone heating systems on pepper plant morphology, and heat transfer rates to plant canopy in the greenhouse. The temperature treatments in root zone heating system were T-15, T-20, T-25, T-30, and a control treatment (TC) at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 30 degrees C, respectively, while TC received no heat. A simulation study was carried out to validate the root zone temperature. The results of the current investigation revealed that energy consumption has an inverse relationship to the ambient temperature of the greenhouse, while temperature gradients to the plant canopy observed from the lower to the upper part of the plant and the upper canopy experienced less temperature fluctuation as compared to the lower part of the plant. The results also showed that treatment T-20 had the maximum in terms of the leaf dry weight, stem diameter, and the number of leaves, while T-25 showed the maximum root dry weight and stem dry weight; T-30 and T-15 had minimum dry weights of plant segments among all treatments. Control treatment (TC) showed a minimum dry mass of plant. The root zone heating with optimal root zone temperature was found to be a viable and adaptable option as this leads to improved energy consumption patterns for the sustainable growth and development of plants in greenhouses during extremely low temperatures.","[Ameen, Muhammad; Zhang, Zhuo; Wang, Xiaochan; Lu, Wei; Yousaf, Khurram; Ullah, Fahim] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Nanjing 210031, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yaseen, Muhammad] Univ Sargodha, Dept Agr Extens, Coll Agr, Sargodha 40100, Pakistan; [Umair, Muhammad; Noor, Rana Shahzad] PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Fac Agr Engn, Rawalpindi 46000, Pakistan; [Memon, Muhammad Sohail] Sindh Agr Univ, Fac Agr Engn, Tandojam 70060, Pakistan","Nanjing Agricultural University; University of Sargodha; Arid Agriculture University; Sindh Agricultural University","Wang, XC (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Nanjing 210031, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","2016212014@njau.edu.cn; 2016112012@njau.edu.cn; wangxiaochan@njau.edu.cn; yaseen.baksh@uos.edu.pk; umairkpr@uaar.edu.pk; rsnoor@uaar.edu.pk; 2017212012@njau.edu.cn; khurramyousaf@njau.edu.cn; Fahimullah320@yahoo.com; engr.sohailm@yahoo.com","Ullah, Dr. Fahim/GOH-3278-2022; Memon, Muhammad Sohail/G-5498-2018; Umair, Muhammad/A-6670-2014","Ullah, Dr. Fahim/0000-0002-3689-8743; Memon, Muhammad Sohail/0000-0003-0079-0260; Umair, Muhammad/0000-0002-9865-0727; wang, xiaochan/0000-0003-0461-8417; Noor, Engr.

Paramo plants have adapted to pronounced daily temperature fluctuations, freezing temperatures any night of the year, high incoming radiation and seasonal unfavorable water availability conditions. Long fallow agricultural systems are common in the paramo, permitting partial recuperation of the vegetation through a secondary succession. Different hypothesis related to plant traits (water relations and gas exchange characteristics or biomass allocation patterns) during succession have been proposed. Particular traits have been associated to the stages along successional gradients from early species (traits related to high resource acquisition abilities) to late species (traits linked to internal conservation of resources). Our purpose was to study plant functional responses of different herbaceous species in an old-field succession in the high tropical Andes. Plant traits (specific leaf area (SLA), maximum CO2 assimilation rates (A(max)), leaf nitrogen content (N-leaf), leaf water relations and biomass allocation) were studied in grasses and forbs along different successional stages. Clear trends in SLA, A(max) on a mass basis, N-leaf and aboveground/belowground biomass allocation were found along the successional gradient for grasses, while patterns were not as well-defined for forbs in the latter two traits. No patterns in leaf water relations characteristics were observed for either plant-growth forms. Strategies associated to plant traits significantly influence plant species dominance and community assembly during secondary succession in tropical alpine open environments like the paramos. Plant traits linked to rapid growth (SLA, A(max) and N-leaf) dominate during early succession. In contrast to previous studies, drought resistance traits were not found to dominate in late succession stages for either grasses or forbs.","[Rada, Fermin; Sarmiento, Lina; Garcia-Varela, Sonia] Univ Andes, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol ICAE, Merida 5101, Venezuela","University of Los Andes Venezuela","Rada, F (corresponding author), Univ Andes, Fac Ciencias, Inst Ciencias Ambientales & Ecol ICAE, Merida 5101, Venezuela.","frada@ula.ve","Fraga Citta, Andressa/AGC-2445-2022","Rada, Fermin/0000-0003-4486-2414","CDCHTA-ULA [C-1186-03-01-M]; IAI [RICAS CRN-040]; Institute of International Education (IIE); Universidad de Los Andes (UniAndes)","CDCHTA-ULA; IAI; Institute of International Education (IIE); Universidad de Los Andes (UniAndes)","This project was funded by the CDCHTA-ULA (C-1186-03-01-M) and the IAI (RICAS CRN-040).

We documented a decrease in lizard abundance over the last 40 years, and changes in the local climate.

In the face of ocean acidification (OA), such natural pH variations may modulate an organism's response to OA by providing temporal refugia. We investigated the effect of pH fluctuations, generated by the brown alga Fucus serratus' biological activity, on the calcifying epibionts Balanus improvisus and Electra pilosa under OA. For this, both epibionts were grown on inactive and biologically active surfaces and exposed to (1) constant pH scenarios under ambient (pH 8.1) or OA conditions (pH 7.7), or (2) oscillating pH scenarios mimicking BBL conditions at ambient (pH 7.7-8.6) or OA scenarios (pH 7.4-8.2). Furthermore, all treatment combinations were tested at 10 degrees C and 15 degrees C. Against our expectations, OA treatments did not affect epibiont growth under constant or fluctuating (BBL) pH conditions, indicating rather high robustness against predicted OA scenarios. Furthermore, epibiont growth was hampered and not fostered on active surfaces (fluctuating DBL conditions), indicating that fluctuating pH conditions of the DBL with elevated daytime pH do not necessarily provide temporal refugia from OA. In contrast, results indicate that factors other than pH may play larger roles for epibiont growth on macrophytes (e.g., surface characteristics, macrophyte antifouling defense, or dynamics of oxygen and nutrient concentrations). Warming enhanced epibiont growth rates significantly, independently of OA, indicating no synergistic effects of pH treatments and temperature within their natural temperature range.","[Johnson, Mildred Jessica; Hennigs, Laura Margarethe; Sawall, Yvonne; Pansch, Christian; Wall, Marlene] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Johnson, Mildred Jessica] Univ Namibia, Windhoek, Namibia; [Hennigs, Laura Margarethe] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Oldenburg, Germany; [Sawall, Yvonne] BIOS Bermuda Inst Ocean Sci, St Georges, Bermuda; [Pansch, Christian] Abo Akad Univ, Environm & Marine Biol, Turku, Finland","Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Namibia; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences; Abo Akademi University","Johnson, MJ; Hennigs, LM; Wall, M (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel, Germany.;Johnson, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Namibia, Windhoek, Namibia.;Hennigs, LM (corresponding author), Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Oldenburg, Germany.","mjohnson@unam.na; laura.hennigs@uol.de; mwall@geomar.de","Pansch, Christian/I-9170-2012","Pansch, Christian/0000-0001-8442-4502; Johnson, Mildred/0000-0003-0987-1374; Hennigs, Laura Margarethe/0000-0001-7153-3304; Wall, Marlene/0000-0003-2885-1301","German Research Foundation (DFG) project; ProjektDEAL;  [SA 2791/3-1]","German Research Foundation (DFG) project(German Research Foundation (DFG)); ProjektDEAL; ","The authors would like to acknowledge Ulrike Panknin for providing Rhodomonas cultures and technical assistance and Mandy Kierspel for analyzing the water samples.

With projected increases in droughts and fewer but more intense rainfall events in the Southwestern United States, the persistence of many wildlife populations may be threatened. Our goal was to assess how temperature and rainfall during distinct dry and wet seasons influenced the dynamics of a population of big-eared woodrats (Neotoma macrotis) in a mixed oak woodland of coastal central California. We applied Pradel's temporal symmetry models to our 21-year biannual capture-markrecapture data set (1993-2014) to determine the effects of climatic factors on the woodrats' apparent survival (Phi) and recruitment rate (f). Monthly Phi averaged 0.945 +/- 0.001 and varied with season. Monthly f was 0.064 +/- 0.001 in the wet season (f was fixed to 0 in the dry season). Monthly population growth rate (lambda) varied from 0.996 +/- 0.001 during the dry season to 1.001 +/- 0.001 during the wet season, which indicated a stable population (0.999 +/- 0.001). Total rainfall from the previous season and mean temperature during the same season positively influenced Phi and f. By contrast, Phi and f were negatively influenced by mean temperature from the previous season and total rainfall in the same season. The resulting lambda fluctuated with total rainfall, particularly in the wet season. Our results suggest that the big-eared woodrat population may not be substantially affected by warm temperatures per se, potentially because of the microclimate provided by its stick houses. We also discuss its adaptability to local food resources and relatively slow life history relative to other cricetids, and propose that the big-eared woodrat population may be equipped to cope with future climate change.","[Rolland, Virginie] Arkansas State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, State Univ, AR 72467 USA; [Tietje, William D.; Polyakov, Anne Y.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Chaudhary, Vratika; Oli, Madan K.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, 110 Newins Ziegler Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","Arkansas State University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Rolland, V (corresponding author), Arkansas State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, State Univ, AR 72467 USA.","vrolland@astate.edu","Polyakov, Anne Y./GLT-3004-2022; Polyakov, Anne Y./GLT-2999-2022","","University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program [R166]; University of California, Berkeley; University of Florida, Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation; Arkansas State University, Department of Biological Sciences","University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program; University of California, Berkeley(University of California System); University of Florida, Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation; Arkansas State University, Department of Biological Sciences","The University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program Grant #R166, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Florida, Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation, and Arkansas State University, Department of Biological Sciences supported this research.

These factors are considered stressful for coral reef biota and challenge reef growth in other oceans, but coral reefs in the Red Sea thrive despite these challenges. In the central Red Sea high temperatures, high salinities, and low dissolved oxygen on the one hand reflect conditions that are predicted for 'future oceans' under global warming. On the other hand, alkalinity and other carbonate chemistry parameters are considered favourable for coral growth. In coral reefs of the central Red Sea, temperature and salinity follow a seasonal cycle, while chlorophyll and inorganic nutrients mostly vary spatially, and dissolved oxygen and pH fluctuate on the scale of hours to days. Within these strong environmental gradients micro-and macroscopic reef communities are dynamic and demonstrate plasticity and acclimatisation potential. Epilithic biofilm communities of bacteria and algae, crucial for the recruitment of reef-builders, undergo seasonal community shifts that are mainly driven by changes in temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen. These variables are predicted to change with the progression of global environmental change and suggest an immediate effect of climate change on the microbial community composition of biofilms. Corals are so-called holobionts and associate with a variety of microbial organisms that fulfill important functions in coral health and productivity. For instance, coral-associated bacterial communities are more specific and less diverse than those of marine biofilms, and in many coral species in the central Red Sea they are dominated by bacteria from the genus Endozoicomonas. Generally, coral microbiomes align with ecological differences between reef sites. They are similar at sites where these corals are abundant and successful. Coral microbiomes reveal a measurable footprint of anthropogenic influence at polluted sites. Coral-associated communities of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in central Red Sea corals are dominated by Symbiodinium from clade C. Some corals harbour the same specific symbiont with a high physiological plasticity throughout their distribution range, while others maintain a more flexible association with varying symbionts of high physiological specificity over depths, seasons, or reef locations. The coral-Symbiodinium endosymbiosis drives calcification of the coral skeleton, which is a key process that provides maintenance and formation of the reef framework. Calcification rates and reef growth are not higher than in other coral reef regions, despite the beneficial carbonate chemistry in the central Red Sea. This may be related to the comparatively high temperatures, as indicated by reduced summer calcification and long-term slowing of growth rates that correlate with ocean warming trends. Indeed, thermal limits of abundant coral species in the central Red Sea may have been exceeded, as evidenced by repeated mass bleaching events during previous years. Recent comprehensive baseline data from central Red Sea reefs allow for insight into coral reef functioning and for quantification of the impacts of environmental change in the region.","[Roik, Anna] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Marine Microbiol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Roik, Anna; Ziegler, Maren; Voolstra, Christian R.] KAUST, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn BESE, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Ziegler, Maren] Justus Liebig Univ Giessen, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, Heinrich Buff Ring 26-32, D-35392 Giessen, Germany","Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Justus Liebig University Giessen","Roik, A (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Marine Microbiol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.","aroik@geomar.de; maren.ziegler@kaust.edu.sa; christian.voolstra@kaust.edu.sa","Voolstra, Christian R./H-7158-2014","Voolstra, Christian R./0000-0003-4555-3795; Roik, Anna/0000-0002-8293-8339; Ziegler, Maren/0000-0003-2237-9261","","","",NA,"176","0","0","0","6","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","2365-7677","2365-7685","978-3-319-99417-8; 978-3-319-99416-1","SPR OCEANOGR","","","2019",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"401","418","","10.1007/978-3-319-99417-8_22","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-99417-8_22","10.1007/978-3-319-99417-8","","18","Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)","Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography","BN4PW",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000482664300023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The outdoor cultivation of microalgae is subject to extreme temperature fluctuations; temperature tolerant microalgae would help mitigate this problem. The waters of the Roman Baths, which have a temperature range between 39 degrees C and 46 degrees C, were sampled for microalgae. A total of 3 green algae, 1 diatom and 4 cyanobacterial species were successfully isolated into 'unialgal' culture. Four isolates were filamentous, which could prove advantageous for low energy dewatering of cultures using filtration. Lipid content, profiles and growth rates of the isolates were examined at temperatures of 20, 30, 40 degrees C, with and without nitrogen starvation and compared against the oil producing green algal species, Chlorella emersonii. Some isolates synthesized high levels of lipids, however, all were most productive at temperatures lower than those of the Roman Baths. The eukaryotic algae accumulated a range of saturated and polyunsaturated FAMEs and all isolates generally showed higher lipid accumulation under nitrogen deficient conditions (Klebsormidium sp. increasing from 1.9% to 16.0% and Hantzschia sp. from 31.9 to 40.5%). The cyanobacteria typically accumulated a narrower range of FAMEs that were mostly saturated, but were capable of accumulating a larger quantity of lipid as a proportion of dry weight (M. laminosus, 37.8% fully saturated FAMEs).

Controlling algal ponds is complex as the cultivation systems are exposed to fluctuating conditions. The strategy investigated in this study uses weather forecasts coupled to a predictive model of algal productivity to optimize pond operation. Productivity was optimized by dynamically controlling rates of fresh medium injection and culture removal into and from the pond. This optimization strategy when applied to a cultivation plant in Nice, South of France, increases the productivity by 2.13 compared to the reference case where the pond depth and dilution rate were kept constant over time. The underlying Model Predictive Control consists of playing with raceway pond thermal inertia and supply of fresh water to reach rapidly optimal temperature, and then keep a balance between photosynthesis and respiration in the darkest layers of the raceway pond. The meteorological inaccuracy for forecasts beyond 24 h was compensated by frequent updates of the optimal control problem. Finally, this scheme turned out to be robust to inaccurate weather forecasts, and the net productivity value reached was close to the productivity obtained for perfectly known meteorology.

However, the environmental factors that facilitate its proliferation are largely unknown. This study investigated the effects of temperature and water availability on seed germination of Japanese weedy and cultivated rice strains differing in degree of seed dormancy and after-ripening. This information could help predict weedy rice infestation and design efficacious control measures. RESULTS The germination responses of weedy rice to temperature and water availability varied among strains and after-ripening duration. The germination rate varied inversely with the degree of dormancy, increased with water availability, and fluctuated between low and high temperatures. The shallow-dormant tropical japonica-derived strawhull weedy rice (TRJ) germinated at 10 degrees C unlike the temperate japonica-derived weedy rice strains, namely, the intermediate-dormant blackhull (BH) and the deep-dormant strawhull (SH). Seeds of all plant strains germinated below the permanent wilting point of clay loam soil, but the germination rates were higher for TRJ and BH than for cultivated rice. SH germination was more synchronous with rice than the other weedy rice strains. CONCLUSION This study has confirmed the overall robustness of germination cold tolerance at 10 degrees C in TRJ, high germinability at low-water availability and high temperature in TRJ and BH, and relatively more synchronous germination between SH and cultivated rice in seeds grown in different years. These observed characteristics are considered advantageous to the coexistence of weedy rice with cultivated rice.

Although the total heat gains were rather similar, leaves of young. still stemless (acaulescent) individuals of Lobelia were subjected to a high diurnal temperature fluctuation of up to 29 K compared to a 14-K fluctuation for the leaves of an individual 3.5 m in height. During the cold nights, temperatures of the inner rosette leaves and inside leaf buds of caulescent plants were 4-5 K above air temperature, while corresponding temperatures of acaulescent individuals were 1-2 K below air temperature. The inner temperature of the stem tissue was higher than the surface temperature of the stem by about 5 K for most of the cold night. The annual rates of increment in whole plant, stem and rosette height, and stem diameter of L. rhynchopetalum showed that the young, still acaulescent individuals, with an annual increment of 5.6 cm in plant height. had the lowest growth rate, compared to 12.1 and 22.1 cm for caulescent life-forms.

Mineral nutrients such as NO3-, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg). manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) present in the plant,shoot and root tissues were also determined. Generally, it was round that 20 C-RZT plants had higher leaf N and P concentrations oil the basis of per unit dry weight compared with plants grown at A-RZT. Results also showed that total shoot and root NO3-. K. Ca. Cu. Fe. Mg, Mn, and Zn accumulation of 20degreesC-RZT plants were more than A-RZT plants. 20degreesC double right arrow A-RZT plants suffered from a reduction of total mineral accumulation. and Ar double right arrow 20 C-RZT plants increased in total mineral accumulation.

The ongoing study aims to reconstruct the natural hydrologic regime of peatlands and restore their typical vegetation communities. In this study, we examine the variability of groundwater levels and groundwater temperature in raised bogs located in the Bieszczady Mts. in southern Poland. Both groundwater table levels and groundwater temperature serve to characterise the hydrology of peatlands, which in turn is critical for plant growth and rates of relevant biochemical processes. Our objective is to determine the predominant scale of intra-annual variability in time series and identify their potential sources by assessing the adaptive response of peat bogs to key changes in weather conditions. For this purpose, data obtained from 9 monitoring wells located in peat bogs, with a varying degree of degradation, were used. Fluctuations in time series and potential linkages between selected variables were analysed in the frequency domain using the continuous wavelet transform. The results show that peat bogs exhibit a relatively high stability of groundwater table levels and groundwater temperature despite meaningful changes in weather conditions. The most visible response of peat bogs to weather conditions was observed in summer and autumn. Our study demonstrates that degraded peat bogs experience the largest decrease in groundwater table levels and more frequent fluctuations. In contrast, groundwater temperature remained stable throughout the year at all the studied bog sites.

The objective of this study was to find an analytical solution to seasonal synchronization of stem diameter oscillations and low air temperatures. The study identified to what extent and with what frequency low air temperature induced stem diameter variation in 'Dvina' (P. deltoides) and 'I-214' (Populusxcanadensis) poplar clones, after exposure to summer drought. The patterns of reversible stem shrinkage were related to the cycles of low air temperature. Hourly and daily evidence showed that 'I-214' was more sensitive to low air temperatures than 'Dvina'. The analysis of raw data and graphic details implemented with the study of derivative tests allowed an increase in the general sensitivity of the investigation applied to describe the response of poplar clones to environmental conditions. Given these diameter fluctuation patterns, automatic point dendrometers were confirmed to be a reliable non-invasive method for testing the sensitivity of diameter variation to cold temperature. Variation in rate and duration of daily stem shrinkage in response to low air temperature in winter appeared to occur independently of the effects of water deficit suffered by plants the previous summer.","[Cocozza, Claudia; Lasserre, Bruno; Tognetti, Roberto] Univ Molise, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Ambiente & Territorio, EcoGeoFor Lab, I-86090 Contrada Fonte Lappone, Pesche, Italy; [Giovannelli, Alessio] CNR, IVaLSA, Lab Xilogenesi, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, FI, Italy; [Castro, Gaetano; Fragnelli, Giuseppe] CRA, Unita Ric Prod Legnose Fuori Foresta, I-15033 Casale Monferrato, AL, Italy","University of Molise; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per la Valorizzazione del Legno e delle Specie Arboree (IVALSA-CNR); Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA)","Tognetti, R (corresponding author), Univ Molise, Dipartimento Sci & Tecnol Ambiente & Territorio, EcoGeoFor Lab, I-86090 Contrada Fonte Lappone, Pesche, Italy.","tognetti@unimol.it","Cocozza, C./F-7656-2012; Tognetti, Roberto/C-4962-2008; giovannelli, alessio/M-2985-2013; lasserre, bruno/G-1409-2011","Cocozza, C./0000-0002-0167-8863; Tognetti, Roberto/0000-0002-7771-6176; giovannelli, alessio/0000-0002-7217-7177; lasserre, bruno/0000-0003-1150-8064; Castro, Gaetano/0000-0001-7007-8645","","","",NA,"48","19","19","0","11","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0022-0957","1460-2431","","J EXP BOT","J.

This microorganism is especially important because it can grow at storage temperatures recommended for milk (less than or equal to 7 degrees C). Growth of L. monocytogenes in fluid milk depends to a large extent on the varying temperatures it is exposed to in the postpasteurization phase, i.e., during in-plant storage, transportation, and storage at retail stores. Growth data for L. monocytogenes in sterilized whale milk were collected at 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C, Specific growth rate and maximum population density were calculated at each temperature using these data. The data for growth rates versus temperature were fitted to the Zwietering square root model. This equation was used to develop a dynamic growth model (i.e., the Baranyi dynamic growth model or BDGM) for L. monocytogenes based on a system of equations which had an intrinsic parameter for simulating the lag phase. Results from validation of the BDGM for a rapidly fluctuating temperature profile showed that although the exponential growth phase of the culture under dynamic temperature conditions was modeled accurately, the lag phase duration was overestimated. For an alpha(o) (initial physiological state parameter) value of 0.137, which corresponded to the mean temperature of 15 degrees C, the population densities were underpredicted, although the experimental data fell within the narrow band calculated for extreme values of alpha(o). The maximum relative error between the experimental data and the curve based on an average alpha(o) value was 10.42%, and the root mean square error was 0.28 log CFU/ml.","Penn State Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Penn State Univ, Dept Food Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; Purdue Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; ARS, Microbial Food Safety Res Unit, USDA, ERRC, Philadelphia, PA 19118 USA","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","Puri, VM (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, 229 Ag Engn Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.","vmpuri@psu.edu","","","","","",NA,"20","52","53","1","10","INT ASSOC MILK FOOD ENVIRONMENTAL SANITARIANS, INC","DES MOINES","6200 AURORA AVE SUITE 200W, DES MOINES, IA 50322-2863 USA","0362-028X","","","J FOOD PROTECT","J.

Similarly, few have studied gross N transformation rates (mineralization, nitrification and immobilization) as an interactive unit. N cycling was examined in clover amended or unamended soil incubated under constant laboratory temperatures of 2, 5, 10 or 15 degreesC for 161 days. Under laboratory conditions we also examined the impact of a sudden change in soil temperature whereby amended soil previously incubated for 98 days at 2, 5 or 10 degreesC was subsequently incubated at 15 degreesC, while amended soil previously incubated at 15 degreesC was incubated at 2 degreesC for a further 63 days. The effect of fluctuating winter temperatures was studied using intact soil cores under winter field conditions for 35 days. The kinetics of N transformations were determined in the laboratory incubation and field experiment by measuring soil ammonium (NH4+-N) and nitrate (NO3--N) concentrations and gross rates of mineralization, nitrification and immobilization. The fate of N-15 labelled clover residue was also measured in the field experiment. In the laboratory incubation and field experiments, soil mineral-N concentration was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in amended, compared with unamended soil. Under laboratory conditions mineral-N concentration significantly (P < 0.05) increased with increasing incubation temperature in amended soil. In unamended soil, mineral-N concentration was significantly (P < 0.05) greater when incubated at 15 degreesC than at 2, 5 or 10 degreesC alone. Under winter field conditions all mineral-N released from clover residues was at risk of leaching during winter rainfall. Gross nitrification was initially (7-56 days) inhibited in amended soil incubated at 2 or 5 degreesC, causing an accumulation of NH4+-N. However, after 77 days at 2 or 5 degreesC, gross nitrification rates increased, such that NO3--N increased to concentrations which were greater than those of NH4+-N. This suggests that nitrifying bacteria took longer to acclimatize to the cold conditions than ammonifying microorganisms. Nitrate-N was the dominant form of mineral-N throughout the incubation experiment in amended soil incubated at 10 or 15 T. In unamended soil, gross immobilization rates generally followed the same pattern as gross mineralization rates throughout the incubation. Unamended soil incubated at 10 degreesC and below produced negligible NO3--N, indicating that N or carbon limited nitrification at these temperatures. Increasing incubation temperature from 2, 5 or 10 degreesC to 15 degreesC caused a rapid increase in soil NO3--N concentration and gross mineralization and nitrification rates, but significantly (P < 0.05) less mineral-N was released than if incubated at a constant 15 T. This suggests that intermediate substrates may have been depleted during the initial incubation period at 2, 5 or 10 degreesC, hence limiting mineralizable-N. Decreasing soil temperature from 15 to 2 degreesC caused an initial increase in mineral-N, which was quickly followed by rapid immobilization of mineral-N; gross immobilization rates were up to 2.8 fold greater than gross mineralization rates. Similarly, under field conditions, microbial biomass N and gross immobilization increased with decreasing soil temperature suggesting there was population growth of adapting micro-flora. The release of mineral-N from clover residues in the incubation experiment also seemed to occur in two-phases, interpreted as first the mineralization of the labile and then the more recalcitrant fractions of the residues. This research has shown that significant mineral-N is released from soil amended with clover residues at temperatures as low as 2 degreesC. Therefore, the incorporation of N-rich plant material should be delayed until spring to avoid winter N leaching. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Maximum nitrogen uptake rates are assumed to decline with shoot dry weight, to allow for the effects of plant age. The model was parameterized using data from the literature, and calibrated for differences in light intensity using an optimization algorithm utilizing data from three experiments in different growing seasons. The calibrated model was validated against the data from two independent experiments conducted under different light conditions. Results showed that the model made good predictions of nitrogen uptake by plants from seedlings to maturity under fluctuating light levels in a glasshouse.

The model results are compared with data collected from May to July 2002 at a station near Resolute in Barrow Strait. Our results show that ice algae are light limited at the beginning of the bloom, then fluctuate between light and nutrient limitation, finally remaining nutrient limited toward the end of the bloom. The fortnightly tide modulates the ice algal biomass through the supply of nutrient to the ice algal layer but mainly through modulation of the bottom ice melt rate. We also demonstrate that the bottom ice melt rate regulates the maximum biomass attained in the region and that a rapid increase in ice temperature can lead to a significant decline in ice algal biomass. The eventual termination of the bloom is triggered by melting of the snow cover and results from ( 1) increased ice algal losses due to high bottom ice melt rate and ( 2) decreased ice algal growth due to nutrient limitation caused by the formation of a meltwater lens below the ice. Finally, our results show that the snow cover controls the length of the bloom, such that earlier snowmelt that is expected to accompany climate warming may lead to a reduction in ice algal production.","Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; Univ Victoria, Canadian Ctr Climate Modeling & Anal EC, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada; Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Freshwater, Arctic Res Div, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N6, Canada; Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Maurice Lamontagne Inst, Mont Joli, PQ, Canada; Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Inst Ocean Sci, Sidney, BC, Canada","University of Victoria; Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling & Analysis (CCCma); University of Victoria; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; Fisheries & Oceans Canada; Fisheries & Oceans Canada","Lavoie, D (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Sch Earth & Ocean Sci, POB 3055, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.","lavoied@dfo-mpo.gc.ca","","","","","",NA,"87","95","99","1","36","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","WASHINGTON","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","2169-9275","2169-9291","","J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS","J.

There were significant differences in conidial size, viability, spore production, speed of germination, relative hyphal growth, and temperature sensitivity. Spore viability after incubation for 24 h at 20 degreesC ranged from 91.4 to 98.6% for the five isolates tested. Spore production on quarter-strength Sabouraud dextrose agar plus 0.25% (w/v) yeast extract after 10 days incubation at 20 degreesC ranged from 1.6 x 10(6) to 15.5 x 10(6) conidia/cm(2). One B. bassiana isolate (ARSEF 1394) produced significantly more conidia than the others. Spore germination was temperature-dependant for both B. bassiana and M. anisopliae. The time required for 50% germination (TG(50)) ranged from 25.0 to 30.9, 14.0 to 16.6, and 14.8 to 18.0 h at 15, 22, and 28degreesC, respectively. Only the M. anisopliae isolate (ARSEF 3540) had significant spore germination at 35degreesC with a TG(50) of 11.8 h. A destructive sampling method was used to measure the relative hyphal growth rate among isolates. Exposure to high temperature (40-50 degreesC) for 10 min had a negative effect on conidial viability. The importance of these characteristics in selecting fungal isolates for management of L. lineolaris is discussed.

Such defensive traits might impair the effectiveness of biological control relying on these natural enemies, mostly parasitoids. In the case of parasitoid threat, these defences consist of the avoidance of the parasitoid (reduced exposure to antagonists through shortening of developmental time), hindrance of oviposition (evasive behaviours and morphological protection) or destruction of the parasitoid eggs (encapsulation and melanisation by means of the immune system). Previous works focused on one defensive trait only when investigating the effects of temperature on host resistance. By doing so, they assumed that all defensive traits would respond uniformly to a change occurring in thermal environment, which remains an undocumented fact. To test this assumption in the context of global warming, we adopted a global overview of host resistance by examining the effects of rising temperatures on multiple defensive traits used by the grape pest, Lobesia botrana, against its larval parasitoids. Although warmer conditions led to reduced exposure to parasitoids by accelerating larval development, warmer conditions also elicited extensive weakening of behavioural and immune defences. These results confirm that temperatures might differently modulate the levels of expression of several defensive traits. An increase in growth rate and pupal mass also occurred, especially for females, which may contribute to greater pest fecundity in the future. However, the decline of L. botrana resistance might enhance the efficiency of the biological control naturally exerted by parasitoids in vineyards, thereby limiting the damage to crops.","[Iltis, Corentin; Moreau, Jerome; Louapre, Philippe] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR Biogeosci 6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Martel, Guillaume] CBGP, INRA, UMR, 755 Ave Campus Agropolis, F-34980 Montferrier Sur Lez, France; [Thiery, Denis] Inst Sci Vigne & Vin, INRA, UMR 1065, Sante & Agroecol Vignoble, 71 Ave Edouard Bourlaux, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bourgogne; INRAE; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); INRAE","Iltis, C (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CNRS, UMR Biogeosci 6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France.","corentin.iltis@u-bourgogne.fr","","Moreau, Jerome/0000-0001-9984-0998; Iltis, Corentin/0000-0002-1379-8029","Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte (FABER: LOUAPRE-AGREE-BGS); Region Bourgogne Franche-Comte","Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte (FABER: LOUAPRE-AGREE-BGS); Region Bourgogne Franche-Comte(Region Bourgogne-Franche-Comte)","This study was founded by the Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte (FABER: LOUAPRE-AGREE-BGS) and the Region Bourgogne Franche-Comte.",NA,"71","19","20","3","50","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1612-4758","1612-4766","","J PEST SCI","J.

Under this scenario, organisms should maintain or develop strategies to cope with environmental fluctuations, such as the capacity to modify growth trajectories. However, altering growth can have negative consequences for organisms' fitness. Here, we investigated the metabolic alterations induced by compensatory growth during the larval development of the common frog (Rana temporaria), quantifying changes in oxidative stress, corticosterone levels and telomere length. We induced compensatory growth responses by exposing frog embryos to cold conditions (i.e. a 'false spring' scenario), which cause a delay in hatching. Once hatched, we reared larvae at two different photoperiods (24:0, representing the natural photoperiod of larvae, and 18:6) to test also for the interactive effects of light on growth responses. Larvae experiencing delayed hatching showed fast compensatory responses and reached larger size at metamorphosis. Larvae shortened their developmental period in response to delayed hatching. Non-permanent light conditions resulted in relaxed growth compared with larvae reared under permanent light conditions, which grew at their natural photoperiod and closer to their maximal rates. Growth responses altered the redox status and corticosterone levels of larvae. These physiological changes were developmental stage-dependent and mainly affected by photoperiod conditions. At catch-up, larvae reared at 18:6 light:dark cycles showed higher antioxidant activities and glucocorticoid secretion. On the contrary, larvae reared at 24:0 developed at higher rates without altering their oxidative status, likely an adaptation to grow under very restricting seasonal conditions at early life. At metamorphosis, compensatory responses induced higher cellular antioxidant activities probably caused by enhanced metabolism. Telomere length remained unaltered by experimental treatments but apparently tended to elongate across larval ontogeny, which would be a first evidence of telomere lengthening across metamorphosis. Under the forecasted increase in extreme climatic events, adjusting growth and developmental rates to the dynamics of environmental fluctuations may be essential for survival, but it can carry metabolic costs and affect later performance. Understanding the implications of such costs will be essential to properly estimate the impact of climate change on wild animals.","[Burraco, Pablo; Orizaola, German] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Anim Ecol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden; [Burraco, Pablo] EBD CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, Seville, Spain; [Valdes, Ana Elisa] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Orizaola, German] Univ Oviedo, CSIC, Princip Asturias, UMIB Res Unit Biodivers, Mieres, Spain; [Orizaola, German] Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organisms & Syst, Zool Unit, Oviedo, Spain","Uppsala University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Estacion Biologica de Donana (EBD); Stockholm University; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo","Burraco, P; Orizaola, G (corresponding author), Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Anim Ecol, Evolutionary Biol Ctr, Uppsala, Sweden.;Burraco, P (corresponding author), EBD CSIC, Donana Biol Stn, Ecol Evolut & Dev Grp, Seville, Spain.;Orizaola, G (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, CSIC, Princip Asturias, UMIB Res Unit Biodivers, Mieres, Spain.;Orizaola, G (corresponding author), Univ Oviedo, Dept Biol Organisms & Syst, Zool Unit, Oviedo, Spain.","pablo.burraco@ebc.uu.se; orizaolagerman@uniovi.es","","Burraco, Pablo/0000-0002-9007-2643","","","",NA,"78","40","40","3","48","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0021-8790","1365-2656","","J ANIM ECOL","J.

The maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) reached 2.15 day(-1) when the concentration of NaNO3 and K2HPO4 center dot 3H(2)O was 1.0 g L-1 and 0.01 g L-1 respectively. The lipid contents of C. zofingiensis grown in media deficient of nitrogen (65.1%) or phosphate (44.7%) were both higher than that obtained from cells grown in full medium (33.5%). The highest lipid productivity (87.1 mg L-1 day(-1)) was also obtained from cells grown in nitrogen deficient media, indicating nitrogen deficiency was more effective than phosphate deficiency for inducing lipid accumulation in C. zofingiensis. In addition, the feasibility of cultivating the alga in 60 L flat plate photobioreactors and 10 L bottles outdoors for biodiesel was also tested. It was found that C. zofingiensis could adapt to fluctuating temperatures and irradiance of outdoors and the highest mu(max) and lipid productivity could reach 0.362 day(-1) and 26.6 mg L-1 day(-1) outdoors, respectively. The lipid production potential of C. zofingiensis is projected to be 31.1 kg ha(-1) day(-1) in outdoor culture. These results suggested that C. zofingiensis is a promising organism for feedstock production of biofuel and can be used in scaled up culture outdoors. (c) 2012, The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

In these species, the timing of adult eclosion with the onset of wintering conditions is critical, because adults exposed to long pre-wintering periods show increased lipid loss and winter mortality. Populations from warm areas fly in February-March and are exposed to longer growth seasons than populations from colder areas, which fly in April-May. Given their inability to produce an extra generation, early-flying populations should develop more slowly than late-flying populations and thus avoid the negative consequences of long pre-wintering periods. In this study we compare the development under natural and laboratory conditions of phenologically-distinct populations in two Osmia species. Early-flying populations took similar to 2 months longer to develop than late-flying populations. Differences between populations in larval and pupal period duration were very small, whereas the prepupal period was much longer in early-flying populations. In contrast to the larval and pupal stages, the prepupal stage showed a non-linear response to temperature, was strongly affected by thermoperiod, and exhibited minimum respiration rates. Coupled with other lines of evidence, these results suggest that the prepupal period in Osmia corresponds to a summer diapause, and its duration may be under local selection to synchronize adult eclosion with the onset of winter temperatures. We discuss the implications of our results relative to current expectations of global warming. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To determine the impacts of these practices on tree growth parameters, fruit yield, and soil environmental conditions we monitored a grapefruit grove (Citrus paradisi Macf. cv 'Rio Red') for five years after planting. Trees were planted under four grove floor management strategies that included flat beds with no plastic mesh groundcover (traditional practice), flat beds with groundcover, raised beds with no groundcover, and raised beds with groundcover. The use of ground cover increased soil temperature and moisture content and led to higher tree growth rates and yields relative to uncovered grove floors. Raising the planting bed to approximately 45 cm higher than the surrounding field reduced soil deposition from irrigation and improved soil properties, but caused fluctuations in soil moisture due to improved water infiltration of heavy clay soils compared to the flat beds. Despite the positive effects of the use of ground cover on yields, there was a trend of alternate bearing, smaller and sweeter fruit sizes for trees under this planting design. The traditional method of planting (flat bed with no groundcover) resulted in smaller trees as measured by tree height, canopy circumference, and trunIc diameter. While yields were moderate, they were fairly consistent across years and increased slightly each year of the study. These results show that adoption of plastic mesh groundcovers in citrus or other tree fruit production could potentially improve water conservation while increasing production.","[Simpson, Catherine R.; Melgar, Juan Carlos; Setamou, Mamoudou] Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Citrus Ctr, 312 N Int Blvd, Weslaco, TX 78599 USA; [Nelson, Shad D.] Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, 700 Univ Blvd, Kingsville, TX 78363 USA; [Melgar, Juan Carlos] Clemson Univ, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, 105 Collings St, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Kingsville; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Kingsville; Clemson University","Simpson, CR (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Kingsville, Citrus Ctr, 312 N Int Blvd, Weslaco, TX 78599 USA.","Catherine.simpson@tamuk.edu","","Simpson, Catherine/0000-0002-8164-4275; Setamou, Mamoudou/0000-0002-4777-4826; Melgar, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-4597-5931","Texas Water Development Board [1513581823, 1213581482]; USDA-NIFA National Needs Fellows grant program [2014-38420-21798]; NIFA [687520, 2014-38420-21798] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER","Texas Water Development Board; USDA-NIFA National Needs Fellows grant program; NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture)","This work was partially supported by the Texas Water Development Board (grant awards #1513581823 and #1213581482).

Chlorophyll fluorescence response was measured under each of three sets of high-low PPFD combinations: 1700-0, 1400-300, and 1200-500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), illuminating in four dynamic frequencies: 1, 5, 15, and 60 cycles per 2 h. The total light exposure time was 2h and the integrated PPFD was the same in all treatments. The highest frequency of PPFD fluctuation resulted in the lowest photochemical activity, the highest level of non-photochemical quenching, and the greatest decrease of F-v/F-m (maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII). The 5 and 15 cycles per 2h treatments resulted in higher photochemical activity than the 1 cycle per 2h treatment. The 1700-0 PPFD combination led to the lowest photochemical activity and more serious photoinhibition in all species. S. superba usually exhibited the highest photochemical activity and CO2 uptake rate, the lowest reduction of F-v/F-m,F- and the smallest fraction of energy in thermal dissipation. With similar fractions of thermal dissipation, S. katochaete had relatively less photoinhibition than G. straminea owing to effective F-o quenching. The results suggest that high frequency of fluctuating PPFD generally results in photoinhibition, which is more serious under periods of irradiation with high light intensity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In spite of the complete absence of rain, T exhibited a modest drop at midday (-2.7 MPa), but was fully recovered overnight, indicating sufficient access to water sources. The stomata remained open throughout the day and season and the high E resulted in leaf temperatures up to 3.9 degreesC below air temperature. Additionally, P-N of the fully exposed leaves was higher than 25 mol m(-2) s(-1) for more than 10 h per day throughout the summer growth period. No symptoms of photooxidative stress were shown, as judged by maximum photosystem 2 photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) and the function of xanthophyll cycle. Indeed, diurnal inter-conversions of the xanthophyll cycle components were modest during the summer and a more intensive function of the cycle was only evident during leaf senescence in autumn.

Changes in germination rates, density, standing crop (amount of biomass aboveground), and plant heights and weights were monitored from February 1999 to September 2000. Seed germination occurred between mid-February and early May in 1999, and from mid-February to mid-April in 2000. The daily mean air temperature fluctuated below and over 0 degrees C through the end of March in 1999 and until mid-March in 2000. Seedling losses due to freezing were greater in 1999 than in 2000. Densities in 1999 and 2000 were 790 and 2201 plants/m(2) in the early growing season, and 578 and 803 plants/m(2) later on, respectively. Therefore, the density and mortality of S. japonica was higher in 2000 than in 1999. Values of correlation were low between density and standing crop, but diverse between density and height. The variation in standing crops was remarkable but that of height was small among sites. Frequencies of size classes, based on height, followed normal distribution curves over time, but those based on weight were very great in the lower classes over the entire growing season.","Dankook Univ, Dept Sci Educ, Seoul 140714, South Korea","Dankook University","Min, BM (corresponding author), Dankook Univ, Dept Sci Educ, Seoul 140714, South Korea.","bmeemin@hanmail.net","","","","","",NA,"33","4","5","0","9","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1226-9239","1867-0725","","J PLANT BIOL","J.

It is common for maize and sorghum to be sown at two different periods: the first cropping (spring/summer) and the second cropping (autumn/winter). The phenological cycle of these crops varies greatly according to the planting season, and it is necessary to characterize the growth and development to facilitate the selection of the species best adapted to the environment. The aim of this study was to characterize phenological phases and physiological parameters in sorghum and maize plants as a function of environmental conditions from the first cropping and second cropping periods. Two parallel experiments were conducted with both crops. The phenological characterization was based on growth analyses (plant height, leaf area and photoassimilate partitioning) and gas exchange evaluations (net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration and water-use efficiency). It was found that the vegetative stage (VS) for sorghum and maize plants was 7 and 21 days, respectively, longer when cultivated during the second cropping. In the first cropping, the plants were taller than in the second cropping, regardless of the crop. The stomatal conductance of sorghum plants fluctuated in the second cropping during the development period, while maize plants showed decreasing linear behaviour. Water-use efficiency in sorghum plants was higher during the second cropping compared with the first cropping. In maize plants, in the second cropping, the water-use efficiency showed a slight variation in relation to the first cropping. It was concluded that the environmental conditions as degree-days, temperature, photoperiod and pluvial precipitation influence the phenology and physiology of both crops during the first and the second cropping periods, specifically cycle duration, plant height, leaf area, net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and water-use efficiency, indicating that both crops respond differentially to environmental changes during the growing season.","[Machado Barbosa, Maria Antonia; Kuki, Kacilda Naomi; Peno Bengala, Pedro Santos; Pereira, Emilly dos Santos; de Barros, Angelica Fatima; Montoya, Sebastian Giraldo; Pimentel, Leonardo Duarte] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Plant Sci, Ave Peter Henri Rolfs,S-N, Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Universidade Federal de Vicosa","Barbosa, MAM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Plant Sci, Ave Peter Henri Rolfs,S-N, Vicosa, MG, Brazil.","mabarbosa483@gmail.com","Pimentel, Leonardo D./H-5455-2012; Montoya, Sebastián/HOC-7824-2023","Pimentel, Leonardo D./0000-0003-2620-4039; Barbosa, Maria Antonia/0000-0002-8701-0599","National Council of Scientific and Technological Development; Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education; State of Minas Gerais Research Foundation; Federal University of Vicosa","National Council of Scientific and Technological Development(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education; State of Minas Gerais Research Foundation(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG)); Federal University of Vicosa","National Council of Scientific and Technological Development; Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education; State of Minas Gerais Research Foundation; Federal University of Vicosa",NA,"65","4","4","1","18","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0931-2250","1439-037X","","J AGRON CROP SCI","J.

The Red Sea is very warm, but total alkalinity (TA) is naturally high and beneficial for reef accretion. To date, we know little about how such detrimental and beneficial abiotic factors affect each other and the balance between calcification and erosion on Red Sea coral reefs, i.e., overall reef growth, in this unique ocean basin. To provide estimates of present-day reef growth dynamics in the central Red Sea, we measured two metrics of reef growth, i.e., in situ net-accretion/-erosion rates (G(net)) determined by deployment of limestone blocks and ecosystem-scale carbonate budgets (G(budget)), along a crosss-helf gradient (25 km, encompassing nearshore, midshore, and offshore reefs). Along this gradient, we assessed multiple abiotic (i.e., temperature, salinity, diurnal pH fluctuation, inorganic nutrients, and TA) and biotic (i.e., calcifier and epilithic bioeroder communities) variables. Both reef growth metrics revealed similar patterns from nearshore to offshore: net-erosive, neutral, and net-accretion states. The average cross-shelf G(budget) was 0.66 kg CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1), with the highest budget of 2.44 kg CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1) measured in the offshore reef. These data are comparable to the contemporary G(budgets) from the western Atlantic and Indian oceans, but lie well below optimal reef production (5-10 kg CaCO3 m(-2) yr(-1)) and below maxima recently recorded in remote high coral cover reef sites. However, the erosive forces observed in the Red Sea nearshore reef contributed less than observed elsewhere. A higher TA accompanied reef growth across the shelf gradient, whereas stronger diurnal pH fluctuations were associated with negative carbonate budgets. Noteworthy for this oligotrophic region was the positive effect of phosphate, which is a central micronutrient for reef building corals. While parrotfish contributed substantially to bioerosion, our dataset also highlights coralline algae as important local reef builders. Altogether, our study establishes a baseline for reef growth in the central Red Sea that should be useful in assessing trajectories of reef growth capacity under current and future ocean scenarios.","[Roik, Anna; Rothig, Till; Pogoreutz, Claudia; Saderne, Vincent; Voolstra, Christian R.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Roik, Anna] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Marine Microbiol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Rothig, Till] Univ Derby, Environm Sustainabil Res Ctr, Aquat Res Facil, Kedleston Rd, Derby DE22 1GB, England","King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of Derby","Roik, A; Voolstra, CR (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia.;Roik, A (corresponding author), GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res, Marine Microbiol, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.","aroik@geomar.de; christian.voolstra@kaust.edu.sa","Saderne, Vincent/ABE-5850-2020; Pogoreutz, Claudia/ABH-2876-2021; Pogoreutz, Claudia/J-2229-2015; Voolstra, Christian R/H-7158-2014","Pogoreutz, Claudia/0000-0002-2853-7673; Pogoreutz, Claudia/0000-0002-2853-7673; Voolstra, Christian R/0000-0003-4555-3795; saderne, vincent/0000-0003-3968-2718; Roik, Anna/0000-0002-8293-8339","KAUST","KAUST(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology)","We thank the Coastal and Marine Resources Lab (CMOR) at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) for logistics and operations at sea (Esam Al-Jahdali, Abdullah Al-Jahdali, Ghazi Al-Jahdali, Ramzi Al-Jahdali, Haitham Al-Jahdali, Francis Mallon, Paul Muller, and David Pallett), as well as for the assistance with the deployment of oceanographic instruments (Lloyd Smith, Mark D.

Stomatal closure and consequently reduced transpiration are considered as early and sensitive plant responses to drought and salinity stress. An important consequence of stomatal closure under water stress is the rise of leaf temperature (T-leaf), yet T-leaf is not only fluctuating with stomatal closure. It is regulated by several plant parameters and environmental factors. Thermal imaging and different stress indices, incorporating actual leaf/crop temperature and reference temperatures, were developed in previous studies toward normalizing for effects unassociated to water stress on T-leaf, aiming at a more efficient water stress assessment. The concept of stress indices has not been extensively studied on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the different indices employed in previous studies in assessing rosette transpiration rate (E) in Arabidopsis plants grown under two different light environments and subjected to salinity. After salinity imposition, E was gravimetrically quantified, and thermal imaging was employed to quantify rosette (T-rosette) and artificial reference temperature (T-wet,T- T-dry). T-rosette and several water stress indices were tested for their relation to E. Among the microclimatic growth conditions tested, RWSI1 ([T-rosette - T-wet]/[T-dry - T-wet]) and RWSI2 ([T-dry - T-rosette]/[T-dry - T-wet]) were well linearly-related to E, irrespective of the light environment, while the sole use of either T-wet or T-dry in different combinations with T-rosette returned less accurate results. This study provides evidence that selected combinations of T-rosette, T-dry, and T-wet can be utilized to assess E under water stress irrespective of the light environment.","[Savvides, Andreas M.; Fotopoulos, Vasileios] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Agr Sci Biotechnol & Food Sci, Limassol, Cyprus; [Velez-Ramirez, Aaron I.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Unidad Leon, Lab Ciencias Agrogen, Leon, Mexico; [Velez-Ramirez, Aaron I.] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Escuela Nacl Estudios Super, Unidad Leon, Lab Nacl PlanTECC, Leon, Mexico","Cyprus University of Technology; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Savvides, AM; Fotopoulos, V (corresponding author), Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Agr Sci Biotechnol & Food Sci, Limassol, Cyprus.","andreas.m.savvides@gmail.com; vassilis.fotopoulos@cut.ac.cy","Fotopoulos, Vasileios/D-4848-2011; Savvides, Andreas/A-8567-2010","Fotopoulos, Vasileios/0000-0003-1205-2070; Savvides, Andreas/0000-0001-7585-3313","Mexican Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [294511]","Mexican Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT))","We are grateful to Dr Chrystalla Antoniou and Mr Jan Pavlou for their assistance during the experiments.

One method to visualize and understand plant physiological responses is to synthesize field data sets into mechanistically-based computer simulation models. The L-PEACH model is a functional-structural interactive plant model that simulates 3D peach tree architecture and carbohydrate flow and distribution. The construction of this virtual tree is based on metamers, repetitive subunits defined as node+leaf+axillary meristem+internodal segments. The rate at which metamers are added over the course of a field season is very important for modeling shoot growth rates but not well established experimentally. Additionally, the canopy is composed of several shoot types that behave differently. In this 2010 California field study, we investigated seasonal patterns of leaf appearance rates (LAR), the time interval between successive leaves, in normal and deficit irrigated treatments on both proleptic and epicormic shoots of mature de-fruited trees. Leaf appearance and leaf growth rate measurements were recorded three times per week from the beginning of the season in April to the end of the growing season in late September. LAR fluctuated over the course of the season and generally slowed as the season progressed. Epicormic shoots added leaves at a significantly faster rate than proleptic shoots in both water deficit and normally irrigated treatments. Although there was a difference in stem water potential between irrigation treatments, there were no significant differences in the LAR between water treatments.","[Davidson, A.

As a control, plants were grown under natural conditions (light period was 12h). The data showed that the diurnal CO2 exchange of D. Ekapol was classified as typical crassulacean acid metabolism type, an obligate CAM. The CO2 balance of each phase was affected by the day length treatments. The CO2 balances of short-day-length grown plants were increased in phase 1, whereas those of long-day-length grown plants were increased in phases 2 and 4. The CO2 balance of whole day and diurnal malate fluctuation was increased in natural and short-day-length grown plants. The activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase did not response to the day length treatments. However, susceptibility of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase to malate was detected dearly in phase 4 and at the beginning of phase 1 under different day length. It was suggested that the difference between treatments was related to the changes in the CO2 exchange rate in those phases.","","","SEKIZUKA, F (corresponding author), UNIV RYUKYUS,COLL AGR,OKINAWA 90301,JAPAN.","","","","","","",NA,"0","7","7","0","6","CROP SCIENCE SOC JAPAN","TOKYO","UNIV TOKYO-FACULTY AGR BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO 113, JAPAN","0011-1848","","","JPN J CROP SCI","Jpn.

To obtain a more complete picture of the seasonality of F. vesiculosus ecophysiology in the northern Baltic Sea, in situ photochemistry, elemental ratios and chlorophyll a and c content of the alga were investigated in field campaigns conducted in different months throughout the year during 2017. Carbon, nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen ratio and chlorophyll a and c content of the alga varied substantially throughout the year, with highest carbon content observed in summer, and highest nitrogen content in winter. C:N ratio in F. vesiculosus apical tissue ranged from 8.6 in February to 48.3 in July. Chlorophyll a and c content followed inversely the seasonal patterns of ambient irradiance. High chlorophyll a and c content in winter was associated with higher maximum photosynthetic efficiency of energy conversion (Fv/Fm), but not with efficiency of photosynthetic energy conversion under light limitation (alpha). Electron transport rate correlated strongly with seawater temperature, and the highest electron transport rates were observed in summer and correlated with highest internal carbon content of the alga. Redundancy analysis conducted on measured environmental variables against physiological responses identified day of year, temperature and macronutrients in seawater as the most important variables driving the observed seasonal patterns in F. vesiculosus ecophysiology. The results suggest elevated temperatures may increase Fucus growth and photosynthesis rates in the study area. Highlights Two distinct physiological states of Fucus vesiculosus were identified. The most important variables driving responses were season, temperature and macronutrients.

The shoot elongation rate and leaf appearance rate were decided by the product of growth activity (GA) and potential rates (PR) realized at the maximum GA under a given environmental condition. GA is dimensionless and ranges from 0 to 1. GA and PR of shoot elongation rate were determined by temperature, photoperiod and shoot length, and temperature and shoot length, respectively. GA and PR of leaf appearance rate were determined by photoperiod, and temperature, respectively. Model parameters were estimated by an iterative method using five-year mulberry growth data. The values calculated by both models were similar to the measured values and represented annual fluctuation well. These models also showed good estimation of data, which were not used for determining parameters. Therefore, it seems that these models well represent mulberry vegetative growth response to temperature and photoperiod, and are practical.","Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058634, Japan","National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences - Japan","Fukui, K (corresponding author), Natl Inst Agrobiol Sci, Ohwashi 1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058634, Japan.","fukuik@affrc.go.jp","","","","","",NA,"20","1","1","0","2","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1343-943X","1349-1008","","PLANT PROD SCI","Plant.

Franco) is an important exotic tree species that was planted across a large part of Europe during the last century. In both experimental trials and conventional forest plantations, the trees grow at a high rate and produce high-quality timber. The present study investigated climate-growth relationships of Douglas-fir at two Italian sites that contrast in climate: a Mediterranean area in southern Italy (Mercurella site) and a cooler, moister site in the northern Apennines without summer aridity (Acquerino). The relationship between tree-ring chronologies and monthly climatic variables was evaluated by a moving average and correlation analysis. Results showed that the minimum temperature in February and in March play a key role for Douglas-fir at both sites, with a positive effect on growth. At the northern site, it is also highly sensitive to late summer temperatures (negative correlation) and spring-summer precipitation (positive correlation). Growth rates in southern latitudes were high even in Europe and in the Mediterranean environment, with low sensitivity to climatic fluctuation. On the basis of our results, further common garden experiments should test adaptation and the interaction between genetics and environment of second- or third-generation seeds from old stands across Europe such as done by the old International Union of Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO) or the European Douglas-fir Improvement Research Cooperative (EUDIREC) experimentation programmes.","[Castaldi, Cristiano; Marchi, Maurizio; Corona, Piermaria] CREA Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Viale S Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy; [Vacchiano, Giorgio] Univ Milan, DISAA, Via Celoria 2, I-20133 Milan, Italy","University of Milan","Marchi, M (corresponding author), CREA Res Ctr Forestry & Wood, Viale S Margherita 80, I-52100 Arezzo, Italy.","maurizio.marchi85@gmail.com","Corona, Piermaria/G-1565-2011; Marchi, Maurizio/T-3813-2019; Vacchiano, Giorgio/C-4494-2008","Corona, Piermaria/0000-0002-8105-0792; Marchi, Maurizio/0000-0002-6134-1744; castaldi, cristiano/0000-0003-1972-8416; Vacchiano, Giorgio/0000-0001-8100-0659","RGV-FAO Project - Italian Ministery of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies","RGV-FAO Project - Italian Ministery of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies","The work was supported by the RGV-FAO Project funded by the Italian Ministery of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies.",NA,"59","13","13","2","20","NORTHEAST FORESTRY UNIV","HARBIN","NO 26 HEXING RD, XIANGFANG DISTRICT, HARBIN, 150040, PEOPLES R CHINA","1007-662X","1993-0607","","J FORESTRY RES","J.

This review summarizes current knowledge of potentials and limitations of acclimation of foliage photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) and light-harvesting efficiency to complex environmental gradients within the canopies. Acclimation of A(max) to high light availability involves accumulation of rate-limiting photosynthetic proteins per unit leaf area as the result of increases in leaf thickness in broad-leaved species and volume: total area ratio and mesophyll thickness in species with complex geometry of leaf cross-section. Enhancement of light-harvesting efficiency in low light occurs through increased chlorophyll production per unit dry mass, greater leaf area per unit dry mass investment in leaves and shoot architectural modifications that improve leaf exposure and reduce within-shoot shading. All these acclimation responses vary among species, resulting in species-specific use efficiencies of low and high light. In fast-growing canopies and in evergreen species, where foliage developed and acclimated to a certain light environment becomes shaded by newly developing foliage, leaf senescence, age-dependent changes in cell wall characteristics and limited foliage re-acclimation capacity can constrain adjustment of older leaves to modified light availabilities. The review further demonstrates that leaves in different canopy positions respond differently to dynamic fluctuations in light availability and to multiple environmental stresses. Foliage acclimated to high irradiance respond more plastically to rapid changes in leaf light environment, and is more resistant to co-occurring heat and water stress. However, in higher light, co-occurring stresses can more strongly curb the efficiency of foliage photosynthetic machinery through reductions in internal diffusion conductance to CO2. This review demonstrates strong foliage potential for acclimation to within-canopy environmental gradients, but also highlights complex constraints on acclimation and foliage functioning resulting from light x foliage age interactions, multiple environmental stresses, dynamic light fluctuations and species-specific leaf and shoot structural constraints.","Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; Univ Tartu, Dept Plant Physiol, EE-51010 Tartu, Estonia; Univ Hawaii, Dept Bot, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Estonian University of Life Sciences; University of Tartu; University of Hawaii System","Niinemets, U (corresponding author), Estonian Univ Life Sci, Inst Agr & Environm Sci, Kreutzwaldi 1, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.","ylo.niinemets@emu.ee","Niinemets, Ülo/A-3816-2008; Lukeš, Petr/B-1771-2010","Niinemets, Ülo/0000-0002-3078-2192; ","","","",NA,"169","370","404","12","259","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0140-7791","1365-3040","","PLANT CELL ENVIRON","Plant Cell Environ.","SEP","2007","30","9","",NA,"",NA,"1052","1071","","10.1111/j.1365-3040.2007.01683.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2007.01683.x","","","20","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","200VN","17661747","Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000248791000003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, the treeline species composition and the pace of its upward migration can be mediated by ecological interactions. In particular, so-called ecosystem engineers, i.e. species that modulate the microscale environmental conditions, at the treeline may play a crucial role. We conducted a three-year seedling transplant experiment at the alpine treeline ecotone in southwest China to study how the shrub Rhododendron rupicola modifies the microscale physical and biotic environments and thus influences the establishment and performance of the two treeline species Larix potaninii and Picea likiangensis. Seedlings were transplanted to the current timberline and treeline, as well as above the current treeline in order to determine the responses of the two tree species to the shrub with respect to the current tree distribution. R. rupicola modified the microenvironment by increasing soil moisture and nutrient contents, buffering soil temperature fluctuations, and by increasing richness and changing the composition of root-associated fungi. As a result, tree seedlings planted under shrubs had significantly higher survival, growth rates and nutrient accumulations than those planted in open ground. Furthermore, seedlings planted at lower elevations performed better than those planted at higher elevations. Beyond the treeline, seedling survival was very low on open ground but strongly facilitated by the shrub. Finally, facilitation effects were species-specific, with Larix benefitting more from the shrub than Picea, while Picea had less mortality than Larix in the absence of the shrub. This study demonstrates that shrubs, through the amelioration of physical and biotic microenvironmental conditions, can act as stepping stones for the establishment of selective tree species beyond the current treeline. This suggests that biotic interactions can strongly modify the treeline species composition and push the treeline beyond its current climatic limits, thereby facilitating the upward shift with ongoing climate warming.

MLAs have shown satisfactory results for effective real-time monitoring, optimization, prediction of uncertainties and fault detection of complex environmental systems. By incorporating these algorithms with online sensors, the transient operating conditions during the treatment process including disruptions or failures due to leaking pipelines, malfunctioning of bioreactors, unexpected fluctuations of organic loadings, flow rate, and temperature can be forecasted efficiently.

Ecological parameters, mainly temperature and prey density, had a profound influence on the growth of S. longiceps and hence the production. In this study, a fish bioenergetics model, coupled with a lower trophic level model, was developed to reproduce the seasonality in the growth of S. longiceps. For this, we have used an Indian Ocean adaptation of an intermediate complex ecosystem model called North Pacific Ecological Modeling for Understanding Regional Oceanography (NEMURO) for marine productivity simulations. The model has 11-component ecosystem variables such as two types of phytoplankton (small and large including flagellates and diatoms), three types of zoo-planktons (small, large, and predatory, which includes ciliates, copepods, and euphausiids), particulate and dissolved organic matter, opal, cycling of nitrate, ammonia, and silicate. The prey densities derived from the NEMURO were input to the sardine bioenergetics model. The coupled model reproduced the appropriate growth rate and wet-weight of S. longiceps in its seasonal cycle in four major fishery regions such as Kochi, Goa, Ratnagiri, and Mumbai as verifiable from the available observation. In Kochi, the mean wet weight was 72.0 +/- 12.8 g (June to September), 65.4 +/- 5.3 g (October to November), 82.4 +/- 2.7 g (December to February), and 66.7 +/- 3.8 g (March to May). Goa and Ratnagiri have moderate weights with mean wet weight as 73.6 +/- 10.6 g (June to September), 87.4 +/- 3.2 g (October to November), 95.5 +/- 4.3 g (December to February), and 76.2 +/- 6.8 g (March to May). In the Mumbai region, maximum weight is simulated with mean wet weight as 97.4 +/- 13.3 g (June to September), 102.1 +/- 1.6 g (October to November), 104.8 +/- 1.3 g (December to February), and 101.6 +/- 1.2 g (March to May).

The observed growth rates are, however, not uniform in space and time, and the mechanistic drivers of these patterns remain poorly understood. Here we investigated spatio-temporal interactions between climatic conditions, xylem anatomical traits, and annual growth of 21 Betula nana L. individuals from western Greenland for the period 2001-2011. Structural equation modeling showed that summer precipitation and winter temperature are affecting annual growth positively. Furthermore, vessel lumen area and vessel grouping, which are related to water conductivity and hydraulic connectivity of the xylem, respectively, positively influenced annual growth. To optimize growth B. nana was thus able to adjust its water transporting system. Annual variation in vessel lumen area seemed to be driven mostly by spring and summer temperatures, whereas annual variation in vessel grouping was driven by winter temperature. Linear models did not reveal a pattern in the spatial variation of xylem anatomical traits across the sampled climatic gradient. However, growth was positively correlated with local variation in insolation. Our results suggest that B. nana can adjust its hydraulic capacity to annual fluctuations in climatic conditions in order to optimize its total radial stem growth rate.","[Nielsen, Sigrid S.; Treier, Urs A.; Barfod, Anders S.; Normand, Signe] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Ny Munkegade 114-116,Bldg 1540, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [von Arx, Georg; Buntgen, Ulf; Treier, Urs A.; Normand, Signe] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [von Arx, Georg] Inst Environm Sci, Climat Change & Climate Impacts, 66 Blvd Carl Vogt, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Damgaard, Christian F.] Aarhus Univ, Plant & Insect Ecol, Dept Biosci, Vejlsovej 25,Bldg M3-15, DK-8600 Silkeborg, Denmark; [Abermann, Jakob] Asiaq, Greenland Survey, Qatserisut 8, Nuuk 3900, Greenland; [Buchwal, Agata] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Geoecol & Geoinformat, B Krygowskiego 10, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Buchwal, Agata] Univ Alaska Anchorage, Dept Biol Sci, 3151 Alumni Loop, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Buntgen, Ulf] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Buntgen, Ulf] CzechGlobe, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; [Buntgen, Ulf] Masaryk Univ, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic; [Treier, Urs A.; Normand, Signe] Aarhus Univ, ARC, Ny Munkegade 114-116,Bldg 1540, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","Aarhus University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow & Landscape Research; Aarhus University; Adam Mickiewicz University; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Anchorage; University of Cambridge; Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno; Aarhus University","Nielsen, SS (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Biosci, Ecoinformat & Biodivers, Ny Munkegade 114-116,Bldg 1540, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.","sigrid.nielsen@bios.au.dk","Treier, Urs/A-1913-2012; Buchwal, Agata/F-5516-2013; Normand, Signe/A-1561-2012; von Arx, Georg/E-1785-2012; Normand, Signe/AAA-4769-2022; Damgaard, Christian/G-2441-2010; Barfod, Anders S./AAP-5604-2020; buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013","Treier, Urs/0000-0003-4027-739X; Buchwal, Agata/0000-0001-6879-6656; Normand, Signe/0000-0002-8782-4154; von Arx, Georg/0000-0002-8566-4599; Normand, Signe/0000-0002-8782-4154; Damgaard, Christian/0000-0003-3932-4312; ","Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation [VKR023456]; Graduate School of Science and Technology, Aarhus University, Denmark; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I) [LO1415]; SAFT (Society for Arctic Science and Technology, Denmark); Villum Fonden [00007380] Funding Source: researchfish","Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation(Villum Fonden); Graduate School of Science and Technology, Aarhus University, Denmark; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech Republic within the National Sustainability Program I (NPU I); SAFT (Society for Arctic Science and Technology, Denmark); Villum Fonden(Villum Fonden)","We would like to thank Fritz Schweingruber for a helpful introduction to the lab techniques used to prepare the anatomical cross sections for this study.

Caulerpa taxifolia displayed low saturation and compensation points (68-166 mmol m(-2) s(-1) and 1.8-11.5 mmol m(-2) s(-1) respectively) and high efficiency at low incoming photon flux densities (0.077-0.197 mg O-2 g(-1) organic dry weight h(-1)/mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Estimated potential depth-limits of colonisation for this species are around 80 m in the extremely clear waters of the central Mediterranean and 50 m in the more turbid waters of the Gulf of Lions (northwestern Mediterranean). Photosynthesis at saturating photon flux densities (P-max) was positive in the range of temperatures from 10 to 35 degrees C, but negative at 40 degrees C. In summer, P-max values were similar from 20-30 degrees C (10.7 mg O-2 g(-1) organic dry weight h(-1)), while in winter a maximum of 16 mg O-2 g(-1) organic dry weight h(-1) was observed at 25 degrees C. These results indicate that Caulerpa taxifolia is well adapted to light and temperatures that are typical of the infralittoral and upper circalittoral zone in the Mediterranean. Its annual productivity pattern seems less affected by seasonal fluctuations in light and temperature than has been reported for endemic seaweeds. This particular response may enable Caulerpa taxifolia to outcompete endemic species and explain its potentially high invasive capacity.","UNIV GIRONA, INST ECOL AQUAT, GIRONA 17071, SPAIN","Universitat de Girona","Gacia, E (corresponding author), CSIC, CTR ESTUDIS AVANCATS, BLANES 17300, GIRONA, SPAIN.","","Gacia, Esperança/J-9238-2012; Ballesteros, Enric/K-6497-2012; Gacia, Esperança/ABG-8522-2020; Prieto, Conxi Rodriguez/AAG-6987-2019","Gacia, Esperança/0000-0002-7687-7437; Gacia, Esperança/0000-0002-7687-7437; Prieto, Conxi Rodriguez/0000-0003-4935-1250","","","",NA,"31","25","25","0","14","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0304-3770","1879-1522","","AQUAT BOT","Aquat.

The rise in the average global temperature, often accompanied by extreme fluctuations, has an important impact on biological processes. Among those, male gametophytes are particularly sensitive to temperature stress during flower bud development and anthesis. Male gametophyte development was extensively studied in several plant species, but little information is available about the effects of temperature stress on male gametophyte development in the genus Citrus. We evaluated the effects of cold and hot temperatures during microsporogenesis and microgametogenesis on one of the most economically valuable citrus species, the Comune clementine (Citrus clementina Hort. ex. Tan.). The effect of constant temperature on the androecium was evaluated by a time course histological analysis performed on the anthers and by monitoring in vitro pollen germination. The results revealed how suboptimal hot and cold temperatures induce drastic alterations on the morphology of the tapetal cells, microspores and mature pollen grains. Shifting from the optimal temperature affected the timing of starch depletion in the anther walls, such as epidermis, endothecium and middle layer, influencing the pollen germination rate and pollen tube growth. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study attempting to assess how temperature stress affects male reproductive development in citrus. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlining male sterility will provide novel insights to elucidate the physiology of this agronomical important quality trait.","[Bennici, Stefania; Distefano, Gaetano; Casas, Giuseppina Las; Di Guardo, Mario; Lana, Giuseppe; La Malfa, Stefano; Gentile, Alessandra] Univ Catania, Dipartimento Agr Alimentaz & Ambiente, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Pacini, Ettore] Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, Siena, Italy; [Gentile, Alessandra] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Landscape, Natl Ctr Citrus Improvement, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China","University of Catania; University of Siena; Hunan Agricultural University","Distefano, G (corresponding author), Univ Catania, Dipartimento Agr Alimentaz & Ambiente, I-95123 Catania, Italy.","distefag@unict.it","Di Guardo, Mario/AAA-7498-2021","La Malfa, Stefano/0000-0001-5869-0348; Bennici, Stefania/0000-0001-6887-8256; Distefano, Gaetano/0000-0002-6080-6466; , Giuseppina Las Casas/0000-0003-2632-3820","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca [2015BPM9H3]","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Universita e della Ricerca, Grant/Award Number: 2015BPM9H3",NA,"49","6","6","2","20","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0003-4746","1744-7348","","ANN APPL BIOL","Ann.

The main objective of the study was to determine factors affecting establishment speed for 'Diamond' zoysiagrass as a putting green in the southern transition zone of the United States. Two sprigging rates, three nitrogen (N) sources, two N rates, and two mowing heights (2.5 and 3.2 mm) were compared at Clemson University, Clemson, SC. Sprigs of 'Diamond' zoysiagrass were planted at rates of 91 or 182 m(3).ha(-1) in 2007 and repeated in 2008. Urea, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate were applied at 1.7 or 3.4 g N/m(2)/week from weeks after sprigging (WAS) 3 to 10. Rates were halved from was 11 to 16. The N fertilizers were applied as solutions weekly for 16 weeks. Weekly percent cover, turf color ratings, root and clipping sample, and ball rolling were collected for both years. A significant difference occurred in turf cover between high and low sprig rates. Turf color and cover results show that high rates of fertility associated with high rates of sprigs produced 100% turf cover at was 11 and 13 in both years. At the 2.5-mm mowing height, ball rolling reached 258 cm in August and was significantly faster than the 3.2-mm mowing height. Results show 'Diamond' zoysiagrass can be established within the same growing season to meet a playable putting green quality, but the establishment speed may vary depending on summer monthly temperature fluctuations.","[Stiglbauer, John B.; Liu, Haibo; McCarty, Lambert B.] Clemson Univ, Dept Environm Hort, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Park, Dara M.] Clemson Univ, Pee Dee Res & Educ Ctr, Florence, SC 29506 USA; [Toler, Joe E.] Clemson Univ, Dept Appl Econ & Stat, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Kirk, Kendal] Clemson Univ, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","Clemson University; Clemson University; Clemson University; Clemson University","Liu, HB (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Environm Hort, 253 P&A Bldg, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.","haiboL@clemson.edu","","","","","",NA,"34","19","19","0","3","AMER SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE","ALEXANDRIA","113 S WEST ST, STE 200, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2851 USA","0018-5345","2327-9834","","HORTSCIENCE","Hortscience","OCT","2009","44","6","",NA,"",NA,"1757","1761","","","","","","5","Horticulture","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture","506LM",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000270776300045","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Anthropogenic sources like once-through cooling discharges from nuclear power plants can also expose embryos to chemicals (e.g., morpholine) and/or radiation. To examine the effects of these potential stressors on embryogenesis, round whitefish were incubated under fluctuating or constant temperatures, with morpholine or Cs-137 gamma rays. We report the percentage of prehatch and posthatch mortality, developmental rate, hatch dynamics, and morphometrics at 4 development stages. Embryos reared at constant temperatures had delayed developmental stage onset and median hatch, higher mortality at constant 8 degrees C, and lower mortality at 5 degrees C, compared with embryos reared under seasonal temperature regimes. Embryos incubated with 500mgL(-1) morpholine (>200x regulatory limits) had advanced hatch, reduced body size, and increased prehatch (100% at 1000mgL(-1)) and posthatch (approximate to 95% at 500mgL(-1)) mortality compared with controls. Relative to controls, embryos irradiated with 0.16 mGy/d had larger body mass early in development, and all irradiated embryos had decreased posthatch mortality; the lowest dose was >300x discharge limits. Our study suggests that fluctuating or elevated temperatures and high-dose morpholine can alter development rate, hatch dynamics, and growth, and/or increase mortality compared with embryos reared at constant temperatures of 5 degrees C; conversely, low-dose irradiation had transient developmental effects but may benefit early posthatch survival.

Somatic embryogenic plants (emblings) were developed under different temperatures to test if temperature influences the spring phenology. Our results show that 9 ? higher temperature during somatic embryogenesis advanced budburst by an average of 4 days, but with significant differences among different genotypes in their response. This reveals genetic variation in the observed phenological response to temperature during somatic embryogenesis. However, we did not observe an effect of differences in osmotic stress during somatic embryogenesis on the response of the emblings to water stress. Optimum temperatures for photosynthesis and maximal photosynthetic rates were not found to be influenced by the temperature during somatic embryogenesis. Both height and autumn senescence were significantly different among the genotypes, but the temperature during somatic embryogenesis did not affect these traits. The observed responses in our study complement findings from other species and support that epigenetic modification in phenology may help the species to cope with fluctuations in temperatures in future climate, and may have practical applications for reducing spring frost risk in plantations of the species.","[Lobo, Albin; Find, Jens Iver; Hansen, Jon Kehlet; REbild, Anders; Kjaer, Erik Dahl] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management IGN, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark","University of Copenhagen","Lobo, A (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management IGN, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.","alo@ign.ku.dk","Hansen, Jon/A-6582-2015; Kjaer, Erik/D-6534-2017","Hansen, Jon/0000-0002-1260-3509; Kjaer, Erik/0000-0001-8624-1611","G.B Hartmanns Familiefond; Villum Foundations Trees for future [VKR-023063]","G.B Hartmanns Familiefond; Villum Foundations Trees for future","G.B Hartmanns Familiefond (proj. 2017-Epigenetisk regulering af torketolerance i Nordmannsgran) and Villum Foundations Trees for future (VKR-023063) supported this study.

We compared stalagmite growth rate with the cave's environmental parameters, air temperature, drip rate, calcium concentration of the drip waters, and pCO(2)-air. We found a relationship where stalagmite growth rate is fast (slow) when pCO(2)-air is low (high) during dry (rainy) season, suggesting that pCO(2)-air controls stalagmite growth. Note that this is a first study that reports that dramatic pCO(2)-air reduction occurring during dry season in a tropical cave controls stalagmite growth. Additionally, we discuss the mechanism of pCO(2)-air fluctuation. Monitoring results show that pCO(2)-air fluctuation is divided into two phenomena: seasonal fluctuations and daily fluctuations. Dramatic pCO(2)-air reduction during the dry season is likely to result from a decline of plant activity due to little rainfall. On the daily scale, pCO(2)-air reached to the minimum around 6 a.m. and maximum around 2-4 p.m., although it is not obvious whether this is due to plant activity or cave ventilation. Also, dynamic pCO(2) pCO(2)-air reduction was observed following cave ventilation driven by the sudden drop of outside air temperature due to a downburst during severe rain. This suggests that heavy rainfall in short duration is also one factor that controls cave ventilation and pCO(2)-air.","[Hasegawa, Wataru; Watanabe, Yumiko; Matsuoka, Hiroshige; Tagami, Takahiro] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Earth & Planetary Sci, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Ohsawa, Shinji] Kyoto Univ, Inst Geothermal Sci, Grad Sch Sci, Beppu, Oita 8740903, Japan; [Brahmantyo, Budi; Maryunani, Khoiril Anwar] Inst Teknol Bandung, Fac Earth Sci & Mineral Technol, Jl Ganesa 10, Bandung 40132, Indonesia","Kyoto University; Kyoto University; Institute Technology of Bandung","Watanabe, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Earth & Planetary Sci, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.","yumiko@kueps.kyoto-u.ac.jp","","Watanabe, Yumiko/0000-0002-9528-5947","Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researches (NEXT Program) [GR063]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26109003, 15K16114] Funding Source: KAKEN","Program for Next Generation World-Leading Researches (NEXT Program); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are indebted to Prof. S.

The giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) exhibits strong intra-annual variation in biomass density, which is better explained by the demographic rates of fronds than by those of whole plants. To better understand the processes controlling the dynamics of giant kelp fronds we collected monthly time-series data of frond initiation and survival. These data were used to determine how frond loss and frond initiation rates were predicted by factors thought to affect the growth and survival of Macrocystis, including external environmental factors (i.e., wave height, day length, temperature, nutrient concentration, and neighborhood density) and intrinsic biological characteristics (i.e., frond age, plant size, and nutritional status). Our results revealed that frond dynamics were better explained by intrinsic biological processes rather than external environmental factors. A metric of frond age structure that incorporated progressive senescence was the best predictor of frond loss rate, accounting for 58% of the explained variation in frond loss. A similar analysis revealed that frond age structure was also the single best predictor of frond initiation rate, accounting for 46% of the explained variation. To further examine the importance of senescence in biomass dynamics, we used frond age-dependent mortality and frond initiation rates to predict biomass in subsequent months and found that the model explained 73% of the observed variation in biomass at our sites. Vegetation dynamics of many species including giant kelp are often considered largely in the context of external controls on resource availability and physical disturbance. Our results indicate that investigations of the processes controlling vegetation dynamics may benefit greatly from the inclusion of intrinsic biological factors such as age-dependent mortality and growth, which can outweigh the effects of external forcing in accounting for fluctuations in vegetation biomass.","[Rodriguez, Gabriel E.; Holbrook, Sally J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Rassweiler, Andrew; Reed, Daniel C.; Holbrook, Sally J.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara","Rodriguez, GE (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","gabriel.rodriguez@lifesci.ucsb.edu","","Rassweiler, Andrew/0000-0002-8760-3888","U.

The diurnal variation of SR showed asymmetric patterns, with the minimum occurring around early morning and the maximum around 13:00 h. SR fluctuated greatly during the growing season. The mean SR rate was 3.16 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), with a maximum of 4.87 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) on July 28 and a minimum of 1.32 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) on May 4. During the diurnal variation of SR, there was a significant exponential relationship between SR and soil temperature (T) at 10 cm depth: SR = alpha e(beta T). At a seasonal scale, the coefficient alpha and beta fluctuated because the biomass (B) increased alpha, and the net primary productivity (NPP) of maize markedly increased beta of the exponential equation. Based on this, we developed the equation SR = (aB + b)e((cNPP+d)T) to estimate the magnitude of SR and to simulate its temporal variation during the growth season of maize. Most of the temporal variability (93%) in SR could be explained by the variations in soil temperature, biomass and NPP of maize. This model clearly demonstrated that soil temperature, biomass and NPP of maize combined to drive the seasonal variation of SR during the growing season. However, only taking into account the influence of soil temperature on SR, an exponential equation over- or underestimated the magnitude of SR and resulted in an erroneous representation of the seasonal variation in SR. Our results highlighted the importance of biotic factors for the estimation of SR during the growing season. It is suggested that the models of SR on agricultural sites should not only take into account the influence of soil temperature, but also incorporate biotic factors as they affect SR during the growing season.","Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lab Quantitat Vegetat Ecol, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; China Meteorol Adm, Inst Atmospher Environm, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R China; Meterol Bur Jinzhou, Jinzhou 121001, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; China Meteorological Administration","Zhou, GS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Lab Quantitat Vegetat Ecol, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.","gszhou@ibcas.ac.cn","Xu, Zhenzhu/L-1362-2015","Xu, Zhenzhu/0000-0001-5246-8981","","","",NA,"54","37","75","0","51","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0032-079X","1573-5036","","PLANT SOIL","Plant Soil","FEB","2007","291","1-2","",NA,"",NA,"15","26","","10.1007/s11104-006-9170-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-006-9170-8","","","12","Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture; Plant Sciences","151OJ",NA,"Green Submitted","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000245299700002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This might alter the greenhouse gas balance and significantly reduce the carbon sink potential of tropical seagrass meadows. In order to assess such consequences, we simulated temperature stress during low tide exposures by subjecting seagrass plants (Thalassia hemprichii) and associated sediments to elevated midday temperature spikes (31, 35, 37, 40, and 45 degrees C) for seven consecutive days in an outdoor mesocosm setup. During the experiment, methane release from the sediment surface was estimated using gas chromatography. Sulfide concentration in the sediment pore water was determined spectrophotometrically, and the plant's photosynthetic capacity as electron transport rate (ETR), and maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) was assessed using pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry. The highest temperature treatments (40 and 45 degrees C) had a clear positive effect on methane emission and the level of sulfide in the sediment and, at the same time, clear negative effects on the photosynthetic performance of seagrass plants. The effects observed by temperature stress were immediate (within hours) and seen in all response variables, including ETR, Fv/Fm, methane emission, and sulfide levels. In addition, both the methane emission and the size of the sulfide pool were already negatively correlated with changes in the photosynthetic rate (ETR) during the first day, and with time, the correlations became stronger. These findings show that increased temperature will reduce primary productivity and increase methane and sulfide levels. Future increases in the frequency and severity of extreme temperature events could hence reduce the climate mitigation capacity of tropical seagrass meadows by reducing CO2 sequestration, increase damage from sulfide toxicity, and induce the release of larger amounts of methane.","[George, Rushingisha; Gullstrom, Martin; Bjork, Mats] Stockholm Univ, Dept Ecol Environm & Plant Sci, Seagrass Ecol & Physiol Grp, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [George, Rushingisha] Tanzania Fisheries Res Inst TAFIRI, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Gullstrom, Martin] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Kristineberg, Fiskebackskil, Sweden; [Mtolera, Matern S.

Temperature. through its effects on physiological processes, also influences motion. Because water viscosity is physically coupled to temperature, changes in temperature can influence the activity of microscopic organisms through both physiological and physical means. To partition these effects, we artificially altered seawater viscosity and, at two temperatures, we measured swimming speed and water movement by larvae of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus. Over an environmentally relevant, 10-degree drop in water temperature (22 to 12-degrees-C), swimming speed was reduced by approximately 40 % and water movement was reduced by 35 %. 40% of the decrease in swimming speed and 55 % of the decrease in water movement were accounted for by increases in viscosity alone. The physical effects of viscosity can therefore make up a large component of the effect of temperature on activity of microscopic organisms. If uncorrected for effects of viscosity, temperature coefficients such as Q10 values can overestimate the influence of temperature on the physiological processes that underlie the generation of motion at small spatial scales, These changes in viscosity may cause substantial reductions or increases in swimming and feeding rates that are biologically relevant. Environmental variation in viscosity due to temperature fluctuations could lead to temperature responses or adaptations that are nonphysiological.","UNIV SO CALIF,DEPT BIOL SCI,LOS ANGELES,CA 90089","University of Southern California","PODOLSKY, RD (corresponding author), UNIV WASHINGTON,DEPT ZOOL NJ-15,SEATTLE,WA 98195, USA.","","","Emlet, Richard/0000-0002-2479-9254","","","",NA,"70","87","86","0","30","COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD","CAMBRIDGE","BIDDER BUILDING CAMBRIDGE COMMERCIAL PARK COWLEY RD, CAMBRIDGE, CAMBS, ENGLAND CB4 4DL","0022-0949","","","J EXP BIOL","J.

Building from diversity-stability concepts in community ecology, within-population diversity is gaining attention as an important component of population stability. Genetic and microhabitat variation within populations can generate diverse responses to common environmental fluctuations, dampening temporal variability across the population as a whole through portfolio effects. Yet, the potential for portfolio effects to operate at small scales within populations or to change with systematic environmental shifts, such as climate change, remain largely unexplored. We tracked the abundance of a rare alpine perennial plant, Saussurea weberi, in 49 1-m(2) plots within a single population over 20 yr. We estimated among-plot correlations in log annual growth rate to test for population-level synchrony and quantify portfolio effects across the 20-yr study period and also in 5-yr subsets based on June temperature quartiles. Asynchrony among plots, due to different plot-level responses to June temperature, reduced overall fluctuations in abundance and the probability of decline in population models, even when accounting for the effects of density dependence on dynamics. However, plots became more synchronous and portfolio effects decreased during the warmest years of the study, suggesting that future climate warming may erode stabilizing mechanisms in populations of this rare plant.","[Abbott, Ronald E.] POB 1431, Greeley, CO 80632 USA; [Doak, Daniel F.; DeMarche, Megan L.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Environm Studies Program, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder","DeMarche, ML (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Environm Studies Program, 4001 Discovery Dr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.","megan.peterson@colorado.edu","","","NSF [DEB-1242355, DEB-1340024]; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1340024] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1353781, 1242355] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","With regard to the field work portion of this project, thanks to all agencies that contributed financial support; special thanks, also, to Barbara Siems for years of logistical support, to Mr. Will Ewing and Mr. Clifford Trentman for permission to access field sites, and to field assistants Barry, Obie, and Steiger for their invaluable help.

Environmental contaminants often affect physiological processes within individuals, which in turn affect the animal's growth rate. Consequently, there is an increasing need to estimate parameters in physiologically based individual growth models. Here, we present a method for estimating parameters in an energetic-based individual growth model (a dynamic energy budget model). This model is a system of stochastic differential equations in which one of the state variables (the energy reserve) is unobservable. There is no analytical solution to the probability density of size at given age, so we use a numerical nonlinear state-space method to calculate the likelihood. An algorithm to calculate the likelihood is outlined in this paper. This method is general enough to apply to other stochastic differential equation models. We assessed the estimability of parameters in the individual growth model, and analyzed size trajectory data from delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). We expect this method to become an important tool in ecological studies as computers become faster, as the models that we deal with become more complex, and as the data that we collect become more detailed.","Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Donald Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bodega Marine Lab, John Muir Inst Environm, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara","Fujiwara, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Ecol Evolut & Marine Biol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.","fujiwara@lifesci.ucsb.edu","Fujiwara, Masami/C-3115-2012; Nisbet, Roger M/B-6951-2014; Kendall, Bruce/C-1871-2008","Fujiwara, Masami/0000-0002-9255-6043; Kendall, Bruce/0000-0003-1782-8106","","","",NA,"30","22","22","0","19","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0012-9658","1939-9170","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","JUN","2005","86","6","",NA,"",NA,"1441","1451","","10.1890/04-1351","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/04-1351","","","11","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","934QQ",NA,"Green Submitted","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000229723700009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

After four consecutive 24-h periods, the magnitude of rootlet colonization by both pathogens was significantly less under incubation that included a daily time of at least 2.5 h at or above the threshold temperature when compared to rootlet colonization for 96 h at a constant favorable temperature. Significantly fewer sporangia were produced by P. citrophthora or P. parasitica at 24 h than after 48 and 72 h.

We also found that with a prolonged period of exposure to elevated temperature there was another temperature-related phenomenon which caused a loss of enzyme activity that appeared to be much slower to reverse. We have termed this effect of temperature on SSS activity ''knockdown''. The knockdown in SSS activity also occurred in-vivo. However, elevated temperature did not affect the activities of several other enzymes in the pathway of starch synthesis (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, sucrose synthase, phosphoglucomutase, phosphoglucose isomerase, bound starch synthase or hexokinase). Because the knockdown effect appeared to be specific to the enzyme SSS, we quantified the effect of knockdown on flux of carbon into starch and used these data to calculate the flux-control coefficient for SSS. Using data at 10-20-degrees-C the flux-control coefficient was C(Starch10-20C) = 0.50, whereas at 20-30-degrees-C the flux-control coefficient was C(Starch20-30C) = 1.38, and between 30-40-degrees-C the flux-control coefficient was C(Starch30-40C)=0.69. Using data at 10-30-degrees-C the flux-control coefficient was C(Starch10-30C)=1.15, and at 10-40-degrees-C the flux-control coefficient was C(Starch10-40C)=0.82. In conclusion, we suggest that SSS is a major site of regulation of starch synthesis in developing wheat grain. During periods of high temperature the control point in the pathway of starch synthesis is apparently not associated exclusively with ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. In field conditions, in which temperatures are fluctuating, there will likely be periods of control of starch synthesis being exerted predominantly by SSS. During periods at lower temperature, control of flux may be exerted by SSS, perhaps in combination with other flux-controlling enzymes in the pathway. Our data point-out a crucial new aspect of quantifying control strengths of enzymes in plants: the determination of enzyme control strengths should be done in carefully regulated temperature conditions. Thus, since temperature is a major determinant of real flux through a pathway and the individual enzymes can respond differently to changing temperature conditions, the control strengths of individual steps in a pathway may vary with changing environmental conditions. This is particularly pronounced in starch deposition, because of the temperature instability of SSS.","ICI SEEDS, CORP BIOSCI LAB, RUNCORN, CHESHIRE, ENGLAND","","","","","","","","",NA,"41","173","222","0","16","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0032-0935","1432-2048","","PLANTA","Planta","AUG","1993","191","3","",NA,"",NA,"342","348","","","","","","7","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","ME166",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1993ME16600007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Soil temperatures at depths of 0, 5, 10 and 20 cm were highest in flail mowed treatment plots (up to near 45 degrees C at 5 cm depth), followed by sickle bar mowed plots (averaging 10 degrees C lower at 5 cm depth). Lowest soil temperatures were maintained in plots that were not mowed; averaging 5 degrees C lower at 5 cm depth than the sickle bar mowed plots. Increasing temperature convergence was observed below 5 cm, with the highest Microbial biomass temperature (flail mowed treatment) at 32 degrees C and the lowest (not mowed) at 27 degrees C increased significantly (P<0.05) from <100 mg C kg(-1) soil in the late spring, to >150 mg C kg(-1) in the early fall. beta-glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase activities decreased slowly throughout the experiment, and were significantly greater (P<0.05) only when comparing the not mowed treatment to both mowing treatments. Dissolved organic C (DOC) decreased sharply, perhaps due to rainfall. Similarly, soil inorganic N decreased sharply, from approximately 0.025 mg N kg(-1) soil in the not mowed plots, to approximately 0.005 mg N kg(-1) during a rainy period. Immobilization of N during rapid microbial biomass growth could also explain the decrease in inorganic N. While resin-extractable P was significantly higher in the not mowed treatment, few differences in extractable P were detected between either mowing treatment during the experiment. Standing oat residues maintained higher levels of soil enzyme activities and the lowest microbial biomass, suggesting that controlling contact of crop residues with the soil may introduce a rate limiting factor for residue decomposition. The timing of residue decomposition in this system may be delayed by leaving most of the plant biomass above the ground (i.e. not mowed or sickle bar mowed). These residue management factors may be important in controlling soil nutrient transformations and soil organic matter maintenance in subtropical climates. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Zibilske, L.

Location The mountains of Dovrefjell, central Norway. Methods In autumn, seeds of ten vascular plant species were collected and sown in a common garden experiment with mats of six lichen species and bare soil controls as experimental treatments. We recorded growing season soil temperature and moisture, and seedling recruitment and growth after one year. The effect of lichen secondary compounds on germination was tested in a growth chamber experiment and compared to the lichen-plant interactions detected under field conditions. Results The lichen mats buffered extreme soil temperatures and soil drying in dry weather, with soils below the thickest mats (Cladonia stellaris and C. rangiferina) experiencing the lowest temperature fluctuations. Seedling recruitment and seedling growth in the field and seed germination in the lab were species-specific. Seedling recruitment rates were overall higher within lichen mats than on bare soil, but the c. 6.5-cm-thick mats of C. stellaris reduced recruitment of many species. The lab experiment suggested no overall strong effect of lichen allelopathy on seed germination, and effects on seed germination were only moderately correlated with the lichen-plant interactions observed for seedling recruitment in the field. Conclusions In harsh environments like alpine dwarf-shrub and lichen heaths, the presence of lichens and the resulting amelioration of the microclimate seem more important for vascular plant recruitment than are allelopathic effects often reported in lab experiments. We might therefore expect most terricolous lichens, depending on the plant species in focus, to facilitate rather than hamper the early stages of plant recruitment into lichen-dominated arctic-alpine heath vegetation.","[Nystuen, Kristin O.; Sundsdal, Kristine; Strimbeck, George Richard; Graae, Bente J.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Biol, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway; [Nystuen, Kristin O.; Holien, Hakon] Nord Univ, Fac Biosci & Aquaculture, POB 2501, N-7729 Steinkjer, Norway; [Opedal, Oystein H.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Dept Biol, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway; [Opedal, Oystein H.] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Res Ctr Ecol Change, Helsinki, Finland","Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Nord University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Helsinki","Nystuen, KO (corresponding author), Nord Univ, Fac Biosci & Aquaculture, POB 2501, N-7729 Steinkjer, Norway.","kristin.o.nystuen@nord.no","Opedal, Øystein H./H-7137-2019","Opedal, Øystein H./0000-0002-7841-6933; Graae, Bente Jessen/0000-0002-5568-4759; Nystuen, Kristin/0000-0003-1027-469X","","","",NA,"71","13","14","1","33","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1100-9233","1654-1103","","J VEG SCI","J.

Dobrovicka. Pot trials were established by the method of gradual plantings during the growing season in partially controlled conditions to assess the effect of the temperature T and radiation I(GR) on the growth and production properties. Field model trials conducted with the same cultivar were established to study the effect of density ranging from 2.55 to 18.68 plants per 1 m2 of stand on quantitative characteristics of the growth and yield-formation. The mathematical procedure of calculation of uniform thickening of stand is illustrated in the flow chart (Fig. 1). Samples were taken for each density in four replications. The samplings to determine dry matter weight, leaf-area index allow to settle: net assimilation rate NAR (g.m-2.d-1), relative growth rate RGR (g.g-1.d-1), crop growth rate CGR (g.m-2.d-1), leaf-area index LAI (m2.m-2), photosynthetic potential LAD (m2.ha-1.d-1), leaf area ratio LAR (m2.kg-1). Simultaneously with it, an average daily temperature T and input of flow density of global radiation I(GR) (Tab. I) were recorded. Experimental data on NAR and RGR, CGR, LAI, LAR are presented in Tab. II. Higher NAR and RGR values were found in dependence on T than in dependence on I(GR). It can be seen from survey of multiple regression equations that CGR depends more on LAI than on NAR. At the same time, NAR changes affect more CGR compared with average T and I(GR). This is logical, as the input of these,factors controls the growth pattern NAR through growth processes. Results of the trials allowed to study the dry matter formation and forming the leaf-area index at each degree of thickening. The lowest dry matter weight was achieved at the lowest stand density 2.55 plants per 1 m2. The highest dry matter output 1.768 kg.m-2 was achieved at the stand density 12.73 plants per 1 m. In our model field trial in which the density was ranging from 2.55 to 18.55 plants per 1 m2, the LAI value was fluctuating during the growing season from minimum 0.38 to maximum 5.36 m2.m-2. Changes in LAI as affected by stand thickening can be seen in the model illustration (Fig. 3). Relationships between NAR and LAI can be expressed by the equation NAR = 16.670 + 5.468 LAI1/2. It is evident from numerical values (Tab. III) and functional evaluation of NAR dependence on LAI values through regression analysis that NAR values are falling with increasing stand density due to LAI increase. Changes in relationships between major components of the production process, integrating LAI and values of NAR, expressing CGR, gives Fig. 4. Changes in the growth of biological yield correlate with LAI, CGR, and LAD values. Identically positive are these indicators to the economic yield up to its maximum value. A detailed analysis of functional relationships between the yield and stand density indicates that this quantitative dependence can be described by the functions of hyperbola and parabola (Fig. 5). The knowledge obtained serves for quantitative description of the model pattern of these relationships. In the model field trial conducted with sugar beet, in which leaf-area index was fluctuating with the stand density, so growth-production indicators, achieved economic and biological yields, as the sugar yield, were influenced (Fig. 6).","","","KOSTREJ, A (corresponding author), VYSOKA POLNOHOSPODARSKA,A HLINKU 2,CS-94976 NITRA,SLOVAKIA.","","","","","","",NA,"0","0","0","0","4","INST SCI TECH INFORM AGR","PRAGUE","SLEZSKA 7, PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC 12056","0370-663X","","","ROST VYROBA","Rostl.

Applying genomics to new breeding programmes can provide important information about pedigree structure and genetic diversity; key parameters for a successful long-term breeding programme. It can also provide insights on potential gains for commercially important, yet complex, quantitative traits such as growth rate. Here we investigated a population of 1100 captive-bred F-1 silver trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus), a promising new species for New Zealand aquaculture. We used whole-genome information, coupled with image-based phenotypic data collected over two years, to build the pedigree of the population, assess its genetic diversity, describe growth patterns of ten growth traits and estimate their genetic parameters. Successful parentage assignment of 664 F-1 individuals showed that the pedigree consisted of a complex mixture of full- and half-sib individuals, with skewed reproductive success among parents, especially in females. Growth patterns showed seasonal fluctuations (average increase across all traits of 27.3% in summer and only 7% in winter) and strong inter-family differences. Heritability values for growth traits ranged from 0.27 to 0.76. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between traits were high and positive, ranging from 0.57 to 0.94 and 0.50 to 1.00 respectively. The implications of these findings are threefold: first, the best on-growing conditions are in warmer months, where highest growth peaks can be achieved; second, size- and family-based selection can be used as early selection criterion if pedigree structure and inbreeding risks are closely monitored; third, selection for body length results in concomitant increases in height and weight, traits of paramount importance for aquaculture. It is concluded that there is substantial potential for genetic improvement of economically important traits, suggesting that silver trevally is a promising species for selective breeding for enhanced growth.","[Valenza-Troubat, Noemie; Morrison-Whittle, Peter; Ashton, David; Wellenreuther, Maren] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Nelson, New Zealand; [Hilario, Elena] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand; [Montanari, Sara] New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Motueka, New Zealand; [Ritchie, Peter] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Biol Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Wellenreuther, Maren] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand","New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd; New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd; New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd; Victoria University Wellington; University of Auckland","Valenza-Troubat, N (corresponding author), New Zealand Inst Plant & Food Res Ltd, Nelson, New Zealand.","Noemie.Valenza-Troubat@plantandfood.co.nz","Hilario, Elena/ABB-8574-2021; Wellenreuther, Maren/H-2710-2019; Ashton, David Thomas/I-6225-2018","Hilario, Elena/0000-0001-8124-8881; Wellenreuther, Maren/0000-0002-2764-8291; Montanari, Sara/0000-0001-9224-056X; Ashton, David Thomas/0000-0002-0996-6368; Valenza-Troubat, Noemie/0000-0003-2479-2009","MBIE Endeavour Programme Accelerated breeding for enhanced seafood production [C11X1603]","MBIE Endeavour Programme Accelerated breeding for enhanced seafood production","We would like to acknowledge all the PFR staff who have been involved with breeding and husbandry for the trevally populations; in particular Warren Fantham who manages the fish breeding, and Therese Wells who manages the post-juvenile husbandry.

The respiratory rate of thermophilic fungi was markedly responsive to changes in temperature, but that of mesophilic fungi was relatively independent of such changes. This suggested that in a thermally fluctuating environment, thermophilic fungi may be at a physiological disadvantage compared to mesophilic fungi. In mixed cultures in soil plates, thermophilic fungi outgrew mesophilic fungi under a fluctuating temperature regime only when the amplitude of the fluctuating temperatures was small and approached their temperature optima for growth. An antibody probe was used to detect the activity of native or an introduced strain of a thermophilic fungus, Thermomyces lanuginosus, under field conditions. The results suggest that although widespread, thermophilic fungi are ordinarily not an active component of soil microflora. Their presence in soil most likely may be the result of the aerial dissemination of propagules from composting plant material.","INDIAN INST SCI,DEPT BIOCHEM,BANGALORE 560012,KARNATAKA,INDIA","Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore","","","","","","","",NA,"21","16","17","0","4","INDIAN ACADEMY SCIENCES","BANGALORE","P B 8005 C V RAMAN AVENUE, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA","0250-5991","","","J BIOSCIENCE","J.

However, it is not yet well understood how changing patterns of environmental variation will affect wildlife population dynamics and other ecological processes. Theory predicts that a population's long-run growth rate is diminished and the chance of population extinction is increased as environmental variation increases. This results from the fact that population growth is a multiplicative process and that long-run population growth rate is the geometric mean of growth rates over time, which is always less than the arithmetic mean. However, when population growth rates for unstructured populations are related nonlinearly to environmental drivers, increasing environmental variation can increase a population's long-run growth rate. This suggests that patterns of environmental variation associated with different aspects of climate change may affect population dynamics in different ways. Specifically, increasing variation in rainfall might result in diminished long-run growth rates for many animal species while increasing variation in temperature might result in increased long-run growth rates. While the effect of rainfall is theoretically well understood and supported by data, the hypothesized effect of temperature is not. Here, I analyse two datasets to study the effect of fluctuating temperatures on growth rates of zooplankton. Results are consistent with the prediction that fluctuating temperatures should increase long-run growth rates and the frequency of extreme demographic events.","Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA","National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis","Drake, JM (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Ecol Anal & Synth, 735 State St,Suite 300, Santa Barbara, CA 93101 USA.","drake@nceas.ucsb.edu","Drake, John/D-6622-2012","Drake, John/0000-0003-4646-1235","","","",NA,"39","84","85","1","58","ROYAL SOC","LONDON","6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND","0962-8452","1471-2954","","P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI","Proc.

Net photosynthetic rates reached maximum values (10.92 +/- 1.24 Mg O2 g-1 dry weight h-1) in spring and minimum values in autumn (5.8 +/- 0.85 mg 02 g-1 dry weight h-1). Saturation and compensation photon flux densities, Ik and Ic, reached maximum values in spring and early summer. High temperature (35 - 40-degrees-C) inhibition of photosynthesis was observed in May and December. Respiration rates always increased with temperature (p < 0.05) but the highest responses were found in May. Ratios of photosynthetic rates to respiration rates (Pn: R) were highest in winter and then declined until autumn, following biomass and age. Photosynthetic and respiratory responses of R. cirrhosa to temperature and light were affected by the environmental temperature at the site of collection and by the corresponding developmental stage. The photosynthetic and respiratory characteristics of R. cirrhosa indicate a species adapted to a wide range of light and temperature, which helps to explain its distribution in shallow, fluctuating environments such as coastal lagoons.","INST RECERCA TECHNOL AGROALIMENTARIES CATALUNYA,E-08348 CABRILS,SPAIN","IRTA","MENENDEZ, M (corresponding author), UNIV BARCELONA,DEPT ECOL,DIAGONAL 645,E-08028 BARCELONA,SPAIN.","","Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Menendez, Margarita/AAD-2043-2020","Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Menendez, Margarita/0000-0002-6590-7960","","","",NA,"22","13","14","0","8","E SCHWEIZERBART'SCHE VERLAGS","STUTTGART","NAEGELE U OBERMILLER JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY","0003-9136","","","ARCH HYDROBIOL","Arch.

Wilczek) is an important pulse crop for South Asian region. Its productivity is low and usually grown under water limited environments. Generally, irrigation at around flowering stage is provided if soil moisture is limiting. Its growth and yield is highly sensitive to fluctuations in climatic conditions, especially water-logging at any growth stage. Present study aimed at developing simple mungbean growth (MungGro) model, following the principles of SUCROS2 and the programme is written in Fortran Simulation Translator (FST). Water balance sub-routine has been undertaken along with G x E interaction, and the model was successfully calibrated and validated for growing environments of Bangladesh. Subsequently the model was utilized to evaluate the interaction effects of increased temperatures and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Yield, in general, decreased with the rise in temperature, primarily due to reduction in growth duration and seed weight growth rate of the crop. Increased CO2 levels compensated to some extent the deleterious effects of increased temperatures. Water-logging, especially at the beginning of the crop growth stage, had pronounced effect in reducing the grain yield drastically that was also reflected from the model. At present, we have calculated nitrogen (N) uptake and N fixation at the terminal stage of the crop. The model further needs to be improved by including N balance and insect-pest sub-routines.","[Biswas, Jatish C.; Kabir, Wais] Krishi Gobeshona Fdn, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Kalra, Naveen] Indian Agr Res Inst, Agr Phys, New Delhi, India; [Maniruzzaman, M.; Hossain, M.

The results of the performance analysis of the impedance measurement circuit show that the circuit has a lateral sensitivity range, measurement range, resolution, measurement accuracy, and power consumption of 0-35 mm, 0-100%, 0.05%, +/- 1.76%, and 0.25 W, respectively. The dynamic response time was 0.296 s. The maximum allowable error by the output voltage fluctuation, owing to the ambient temperature and humidity, was only +/- 0.635%, which meets the actual use requirements. The calibration curve fit coefficients were >0.98, indicating a significant correlation. The ice content of plant branches under cold stress was measured for indoor and field environments, and the sensors could effectively monitor changes in the branch ice content in plants exposed to cold stress. Additionally, they can differentiate between plants with different cold resistances, indicating the reliability of the BVIC sensor.","[Tian, Hao; Gao, Chao; Xie, Tao; Yu, Chongchong] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Tian, Hao; Gao, Chao; Xie, Tao; Yu, Chongchong] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, China Light Ind Key Lab Ind Internet & Big Data, Beijing 102448, Peoples R China","Beijing Technology & Business University; Beijing Technology & Business University","Yu, CC (corresponding author), Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.;Yu, CC (corresponding author), Beijing Technol & Business Univ, China Light Ind Key Lab Ind Internet & Big Data, Beijing 102448, Peoples R China.","chongzhy@vip.sina.com","","","Beijing Natural Science Foundation [6214034]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFD2100605]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [62006008, 62173007]; Research Foundation for Youth Scholars of Beijing Technology and Business University [QNJJ2022-37]","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Research Foundation for Youth Scholars of Beijing Technology and Business University","This research was supported by Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. 6214034), National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2021YFD2100605), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62006008, 62173007), Research Foundation for Youth Scholars of Beijing Technology and Business University (No. QNJJ2022-37).",NA,"56","0","0","8","8","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2072-666X","","MICROMACHINES-BASEL","Micromachines","FEB","2023","14","2","",NA,"",NA,"","","440","10.3390/mi14020440","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/mi14020440","","","23","Chemistry, Analytical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Instruments & Instrumentation; Physics, Applied","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Instruments & Instrumentation; Physics","9K1VL","36838140","Green Published, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000940660900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The longest developmental time of apterous aphids was obtained at 8 degrees C (31.5 d), and the shortest was at 26 degrees C (6.2 d), whereas the developmental time of alates was always 0.7-1.1 d longer than for apterous. Most aphids needed four instars to reach adult stage, but at 8, 26, and 28 degrees C, many individuals passed through five or six molts. Age-specific survivorship, (lx) was always above 90% at the temperature range of 16-24 degrees C. Mortality rate (qx) was rather low but constant at 8 degrees C. However, mortality was high at 28 degrees C and occurred mainly in the last nymphal instars and adult stage. Unexpectedly, no nymphs were produced by the adult morpbs at 28 degrees C, but effective fecundity was high at 8 degrees C. Fecundity for alates was always lower than for the apterous aphids at the same temperature. The largest intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), and the mean relative growth rate (RGR) occurred at 24 degrees C, for both apterous and alate morpbs, and the lowest at 8 degrees C.

Negative consequences of the fouling formation are the reduction in heat transfer, loss of cooling efficiency, premature deterioration of facilities and increased operation and maintenance costs. In order to minimize this undesirable phenomenon and its effects, antifouling treatments are applied to reduce the accumulation of deposits. A major concern among industrial facilities is the correct choice of a suitable antifouling treatment and its optimization in order to keep the cooling system in optimal conditions and, at the same time, minimize harmful discharges to the environment. This study evaluates the development of fouling in a condenser of a combined cycle power plant, cooled by seawater under actual operating conditions, which means: irregular chlorine treatment, seasonal influence and fluctuation of flow rate according to the number of circulating pumps in operation. The aim of the study was to determine the best operating conditions for improving antifouling treatment. The experiments were carried out in a pilot plant simulating the industrial condenser and operating as side-stream monitoring device on the cooling system while drawing water from the same point than the power plant. Fouling progression throughout an annual cycle and under actual operating conditions was monitored and evaluated. In all the seasons, the chlorine-based antifouling treatment reduced the amount of total solids by approximately 80-85% compared to the control. Control tubes as well as the rest of the test tubes, presented the maximum accumulated fouling in spring, while the lowest quantity of fouling was obtained in winter. The results under the different operating conditions showed that both, the solids accumulation as well as the heat transfer resistance were higher than the rest, when low water velocities were used. Furthermore, the circulating water flow rate affected the composition of the deposits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Materials employed in power plant are nowadays exposed to both severe conditions and cycling load. Today's dispatchable plants reach lower capacity factors due to a load following operation or due to the fluctuating availability of renewable sources in the electrical grid. The quest for higher efficiency leads to the need of employing steels with a high steam oxidation resistance, while ferritic steels are favored under cycling operation thanks to limited thermal expansion compared to austenitic stainless steel. 9% Cr Creep Strength Enhanced Ferritic (CSEF) steels are limited in temperature mainly due to capping their steam oxidation resistance capabilities at levels required by the drive for efficiency increase. For heat-exchangers manufactured from conventional materials, the formation, growth and spallation of oxide scale on the steam side may eventually impair plant operations and damage other downstream components. This work presents a case study collaboratively performed together with the Department of Energy of Politecnico di Milano (Italy). A combined cycle power plant consisting of the GE 9HA0.2 GT has been modelled based on first principles, considering as a collection of interconnected equipment. The Heat Recovery Heat generator (HRSG) design features three pressure levels, including a once-through boiler for the highest pressure level. A comparative analysis of this plant has been performed by considering three different maximum live steam temperatures (585 degrees C, 605 degrees C, 620 degrees C) and four different alloys, the standard ferritic grades 91 and 92; stainless S304H; and the new Tenaris solution Thor (TM) 115 (Tenaris High Oxidation Resistance), for the heat-exchangers severely exposed to steam oxidation, i.e. the final superheater (SH) and reheater (RH) sections. The study highlights that the Tenaris solution, the CSEF steel grade Thor (TM) 115, with its improved steam oxidation resistance, offers an alternative to stainless steel solutions for live steam temperatures above 600 degrees C. The use of conventional 9%Cr CSEF steel grades at live steam temperatures above 600 degrees C is generally impeded due to an accelerated corrosion. The improved steam oxidation resistance of Thor (TM) 115 consequently leads to negligible corrosion allowances, resulting in marginal overall weight increase of the HRSG for the same rated power output compared to stainless solutions, while still offering the manufacturing advantages of ferritic grades. Moreover modern CSEF steels are more recommended than stainless steel solutions for power plants operated at lower capacity factors, due to their superior thermophysical properties compared thus limiting the thermal fatigue; as these plants need to cope with fast and frequent load change. Considering the efficiency boost linked to the live steam temperature increase of the power plant it considerably contributes to CO2 savings for the same nominal power output.","[Ceuca, S.; Ferrara, A.; Baietta, S.] Tenaris Dalmine, Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Campanari, S.; Chiesa, P.; Zecca, Nicola] Politecn Milano Italy, Dept Energy, Milan, Italy","Polytechnic University of Milan","Ceuca, S (corresponding author), Tenaris Dalmine, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.","","","","","","",NA,"3","0","0","0","0","ASM INTERNATIONAL","MATERIALS PARK","9503 KINSMAN RD, MATERIALS PARK, OH 44073 USA","","","978-1-62708-271-6","","","","2019",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"990","997","","","","","","8","Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering","BO2FW",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000505657800102","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This study uses descriptive data to examine the shift in dominance in the rotifer community in summer from Keratella cochlearis to Anuraeopsis fissa in a shallow eutrophic lake. Population density and egg ratio were estimated from May to September for these small loricate rotifers, as well as the soft-bodied Filinia longiseta and Polyarthra spp., to compare rates of population increase, birth and death. 2. Keratella cochlearis was succeeded by A. fissa in late May, perhaps as a result of the shorter egg development times of the latter at temperatures > 15 degrees C, and species-specific responses to food and predation. Population variables suggest that the decline of K. cochlearis was the result of a food shortage which caused a decrease in reproduction and increased mortality. 3. High population densities of A. fissa and Polyarthra spp. were associated with low egg ratios, birth rates and rates of increase within a species, suggesting intraspecific competition. The egg ratios of the two soft-bodied rotifers were strongly intercorrelated in the study period, although their diets supposedly differ. The egg ratios of A. fissa showed positively correlated fluctuations with the abundance of diatoms. 4. Short periods of higher rates of increase of A. fissa conferred advantage to this rotifer and manifested in its dominance. The mean birth rates of A. fissa and F. longiseta were twice as high as for K. cochlearis. Furthermore, death rates of loricate and soft-bodied rotifers were similar and high, which suggests that food shortage similarly increased death rates, or that predation may be sometimes substantial for soft-bodied and loricate species, or both. 5. Predation was probably not an important factor in steering the seasonal succession in the lake. A difference in abilities of the studied rotifers to exploit resources seems more important. Perhaps temperature is also a factor, but the specifics remain unclear and await more experimental work.","Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Limnol, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands","Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW)","Gulati, RD (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Limnol, Rijksstr Weg 6, NL-3631 AC Nieuwersluis, Netherlands.","","Gulati, Ramesh D/F-4943-2013; Gulati, Ramesh D./A-3155-2011","","","","",NA,"68","30","32","1","11","BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND","0046-5070","","","FRESHWATER BIOL","Freshw.

Recently, the demand of C. lentillifera is rapidly increasing, because it is utilized not only as food but also as functional ingredients. Therefore, a growth enhancement technology of algae using carbon dioxide (CO2) attracts attention as productivity improvement technology. Although it has been reported that the growth of C. lentillifera is facilitated when CO2 is added to culture seawater, the effects of environmental factors during cultivation has not been clarified. Accordingly, we investigated the influences of seawater temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C), photon flux density (75 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 125 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 250 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and photoperiod (12 L/12 D, 18 L/6 D, 24 L/0 L) on the growth of C. lentillifera cultivated in the highly concentrated CO2 seawater. As a result, it was possible to increase the growth rate of C. lentillifera by addition of CO2 under any conditions. This suggested that the use of the CO2-enriched seawater improved the decrease of the growth amount due to seawater temperature fluctuation and insufficient sunshine.","[Senaha, Izuru; Nagamatsu, Kazunari] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Syst Engn, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan","University of the Ryukyus","Senaha, I (corresponding author), Univ Ryukyus, Fac Engn, Dept Mech Syst Engn, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.","senaha@tec.u-ryukyu.ac.jp","","","","","",NA,"21","0","0","0","0","JAPAN INST ENERGY","TOKYO","6F, 6-5-4 SOTOKANDA, SOTOKANDA CHIYODA BLDG 4-F, TOKYO, 101-0021, JAPAN","0916-8753","1882-6121","","J JPN I ENERGY","J.

Caldenia; BIOdry; Dendrochronology; Wavelet; Aridity index","TREE-GROWTH; CLIMATE; AGE; RESPONSES; PINUS; SOUTH","The semiarid Pampas in central Argentina, occupied by calden's (Prosopis caldenia Burkart) woodlands (caldenales), had been affected by several wet and dry periods in the last century. Nowadays, the caldenales cover about 17 million hectares of central Argentina and their current state is critical due to massive deforestation rates. Calden has an important dendrochronological potential since it produces sensitive tree rings linked to climate oscillations, fire events, competence, insect breakout, among others. The standard dendrochronological analysis can be improved with new advances in serial modeling and multivariate ordination techniques for handling problems related to the comparison of dendrochronological samples. We applied a statistical algorithm, BIOdry, which integrates conventional procedures for modeling patterns between annual diameter increments and drought. P. caldenia dendrochronological data were used accounting for multiple sources of variation from the sample design, and comparing patterns from contrasting climatic portions of the study site. The relation between diameter growth dynamics of calden with temperature and precipitation fluctuations along the second half of the last century was analyzed. Populations at the Northern limit of its natural distribution area were selected. Monthly temperature and precipitation were evaluated in order to identify relative water surplus and deficit periods and an annual aridity index (AAI) was calculated. The objectives of the present work were: to analyze, describe and model response patterns between the P. caldenia diameter growth increment and the AAIs. A common growth response pattern and differences in tree and population level were also analysed. The algorithm BIOdry showed a good behavior, according to the considered statistical parameters (all the fixed effects were statistically significant). Several and common problems associated with the nature of the tree-ring data in modeling (pseudorreplication, autocorrelation, and nested random effects) were efficiently addressed. P. caldenia diameter growth, at tree level significantly responds to different AAI variation intensities along the studied period. A high frequency growth variability at population level was detected when trees establishment happened. These associations ended when trees become older. Low frequency growth variability at population level was significant throughout the analyzed period, presumably linked to age and management history. These results provide news insights in relation to the climate impact on growth dynamics of calden in the Argentinean pampas and the value of new statistical tools in order to improve dendrochronological studies.","[Allione, Risio L.] UNSL, CONICET, Inst Multidisciplinario Invest Biol, Av Ejercito de los Andes 950, RA-5700 San Luis, Argentina; [Lara, W.

In actual practice, recommendations of nutrient dosage are based on long-range predictions (whole cultivation period) of water and N demand, as well as from optimum constant N concentrations in nutrient solution or substrate. Short-term fluctuation of temperature and radiation conditions that affect plant growth rates, as well as nutrient and water uptake rates within individual growing periods, are not considered. In the future, models fluctuating greenhouse conditions will be necessary for improved N-use efficiency. In this study, N uptake of cut chrysanthemums (Dendranthema Grandiflorum Hybrids) cv. 'Puma white' were obtained in a soilless commercial-style cultivation system with planting at four dates (5. 11. 91; 25. 3. 92; 4. 1. 93; 1. 7. 93). In all experiments, shoots were harvested every 14 days from planting until flowering, with dry matter, internal N concentration, and shoot height being measured. In the soilless cultivation system, dry matter concentrations of N (4 to 3 %) remained constant over the whole growing period with r < - 0.20, indicating non-limiting nitrogen supply. For each planting date, N uptake (y) was closely (r(2) = 0.94; 0.93; 0.84; 0.93, respectively) related to shoot height (x) at the time of cutting and could be characterized by the equation y = a*x(b), where a and b are empirical regression coefficients. In agreement with constant internal N concentrations, N uptake (0 to 800 mg N* plant(-1)) was linearly related to dry matter accumulation (0 to 20 g* plant(-1)) with coefficients of determination ranging from .94 to 0.99. Therefore, typical S-shaped curves of nitrogen uptake could not be reproduced in these experiments. Canopy dry matter was correlated to canopy shoot height (r values ranging from 0.92 to 0.97), reflecting constant shoot densities (64 m(-2)) during the entire growing period in this type of cut flower canopy. The results allow a distinct simplification of regression models of N uptake in that shoot height instead of dry matter or plant age could be used as the independent variable. Considering the results of regression analyses, a theory was developed for modelling nitrogen uptake.","","","Zerche, S (corresponding author), INST GEMUSE & ZIERPFLANZENBAU GROSSBEEREN ERFURT, MITTELHAUSER STR, D-99189 KUHNHAUSEN, GERMANY.","","Zerche, Siegfried Bernhard/Q-2129-2019","Zerche, Siegfried Bernhard/0000-0003-1673-5266","","","",NA,"44","6","8","0","1","EUGEN ULMER GMBH CO","STUTTGART","POSTFACH 700561 WOLLGRASWEG 41, D-70599 STUTTGART, GERMANY","0016-478X","","","GARTENBAUWISSENSCHAF","Gartenbauwissenschaft","MAY-JUN","1997","62","3","",NA,"",NA,"119","128","","","","","","10","Horticulture","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture","XL025",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1997XL02500005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, information on the effects of key plant traits and phylogenetic relatedness on seed germination is limited at large regional scales that vary in climate. To test the hypotheses that phylogenetic niche conservatism plays a critical force in shaping seed ecophysiological traits across species, and also drives their response to climatic fluctuation, we conducted a controlled experiment on seed germination and determined the percentage and rate of germination for 249 species in subtropical China under two temperature regimes (i.e., daily 25 degrees C; daily alternating 25/15 degrees C for each 12 hr). Germination was low with a skewed distribution (mean = 38.9% at 25 degrees C, and 43.3% at 25/15 degrees C). One fifth of the species had low (<10%) and slow (4-30 days) germination, and only a few (8%) species had a high (>80%) and rapid (1.2-6.6 days) germination. All studied plant traits (including germination responses) showed a significant phylogenetic signal, with an exception of seed germination percentage under the alternating temperature scenario. Generalized linear models (GLMs) and phylogenetic generalized estimation equations (GEEs) demonstrated that growth form and seed dispersal mode were strong drivers of germination. Our experimental study highlights that integrating plant key traits and phylogeny is critical to predicting seed germination response to future climate change.","[Wang, JuHong] Hanshan Normal Univ, Coll Food Technol & Life Sci, Chaozhou 521041, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xu, GeXi] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Wen] Hanshan Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Tourism Management, Chaozhou 521041, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ma, YanBo] Hanshan Normal Univ, Coll Math & Stat, Chaozhou, Peoples R China; [Qi, Wei] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Grassland Agroecosyst, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, ChunHui] Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining, Peoples R China; [Cui, XianLiang] Puer Univ, Coll Biol & Chem, Puer, Peoples R China","Hanshan Normal University; Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, CAF; Hanshan Normal University; Hanshan Normal University; Lanzhou University; Qinghai University; Pu'er University","Wang, JH (corresponding author), Hanshan Normal Univ, Coll Food Technol & Life Sci, Chaozhou 521041, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Chen, W (corresponding author), Hanshan Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Tourism Management, Chaozhou 521041, Guangdong, Peoples R China.","wjuh1918@163.com; cyw1018@sina.com","Zhang, Chunhui/G-4663-2016","Zhang, Chunhui/0000-0002-1500-4114","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770584, 31770448]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 31770584 and 31770448",NA,"81","3","3","4","19","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","2045-7758","","","ECOL EVOL","Ecol.

In the period 2012-2017, we analysed the population demography and spatial structure, growth and flowering phenology, and genetic variability to understand the history, current state and possible evolution of this population. Lastly, the population data were tested for association with environmental factors. The population studied consists of plants on average 10 years old, showing the highest growth rates in spring and autumn. Anthesis starts in April and ends in early June and is significantly dependent on temperature. High levels of genetic variability are present (average He = 0.471), with heterozygote excess detected at four loci out of five. Bayesian analysis does not support any genetic structuring of the population. The aggregated pattern in the distribution of individuals and their phenological traits, together with the absence of genetic structuring, seem to suggest that this extreme geographical population is not currently endangered.","[Bertolasi, Bruno; Zago, Luisa; Gui, Lorenzo] Ctr Nazl Biodivers Forestale Peri Carabinieri, Via Ponte 256, I-37020 Peri, VR, Italy; [Sitzia, Tommaso] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy; [Vanetti, Isabella; Binelli, Giorgio] Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Biotecnol & Sci Vita, Via JH Dunant 3, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Puppi, Giovanna; Buldrini, Fabrizio; Pezzi, Giovanna] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Via Irnerio 42, I-40126 Bologna, Italy","University of Padua; University of Insubria; University of Bologna","Buldrini, F (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, Via Irnerio 42, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.","bruno.bertolasi@gmail.com; luisa_zago@yahoo.it; gui.peri@libero.it; tommaso.sitzia@unipd.it; isabella.vanetti@uninsubria.it; giorgio.binelli@uninsubria.it; giovanna.puppi@unibo.it; fabrizio.buldrini@unibo.it; giovanna.pezzi@unibo.it","Sitzia, Tommaso/D-3371-2009; PEZZI, GIOVANNA/L-5680-2015","Sitzia, Tommaso/0000-0001-6221-4256; PEZZI, GIOVANNA/0000-0001-9739-3530; Buldrini, Fabrizio/0000-0002-0376-6760","Ministero della Difesa; FAR - Fondo di Ateneo per la Ricerca","Ministero della Difesa; FAR - Fondo di Ateneo per la Ricerca","This work was partially supported by institutional funds of the Ministero della Difesa (director, Col.

Larvae were exposed to high temperatures and low salinities for 24 hours, followed by feeding on the alga Isochrysis galbana in high or low salinity for another 10 minutes. Exposing Pisaster larvae to high temperatures and low salinities, followed by feeding in low salinity, did not impair ingestion rates. In fact, these larvae ingested particles at similar and sometimes higher rates than those in the controls. In sharp contrast, a 24-hour exposure to a high temperature and low salinity, followed by continued exposure to low salinity to feed, led to a decrease in the number of particles ingested by 8-arm Dendraster larvae. Larvae of both species captured very few particles when returned to 30 parts per thousand after a low-salinity event, indicating that continuous interruption of larval feeding by low-salinity events during development could be deleterious. Sand dollar larvae may have responded negatively to low-salinity events in our experiments because they are found in protected bays, where they may seldom experience these events.","[George, Sophie B.] Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA; [Navarro, Eric] Indiana Univ, Dept Biol, Bloomington, IN USA; [Kawano, Dane] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA USA","University System of Georgia; Georgia Southern University; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Stanford University","George, SB (corresponding author), Georgia Southern Univ, Dept Biol, Statesboro, GA 30458 USA.","georges@georgiasouthern.edu","","","National Science Foundation REU Site awards [DBI-1262239, DBI-1852096]","National Science Foundation REU Site awards","We thank Anders Hay-Schmidt for sea stars collected and spawned (May 5, 2017); Richard Strathmann, who has been instrumental over the years in providing a lot of help in ensuring the success of our research projects at Friday Harbor Laboratories; Chloe Johnson, who helped in analyzing larval pictures using ImageJ; and Jose A.

Upon a sudden increase in light intensity, electron flow from photosystem II initially increased and then gradually decreased at 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C, indicating that the operation of FLV-dependent flow lasted much longer than previously thought. Furthermore, the absolute rates of FLV-dependent flow and CEF were enhanced under fluctuating light at 35 degrees C, pointing to their important roles in photoprotection when exposed to fluctuating light at moderate high temperature. Furthermore, the downregulation of FLV activity at 4 degrees C was partially compensated for by enhanced CEF activity. These results suggested the subtle coordination between FLV activity and CEF under fluctuating light and temperature stress. Racomitrium japonicum and Hypnum plumaeforme, which usually grow under relatively high light levels, exhibited higher FLV activity and CEF than the shade-grown moss Plagiomnium ellipticum. Based on our results, we conclude that photosynthetic acclimation to fluctuating light and temperature stress in different mosses is largely linked to the adjustment of FLV activity and CEF.","[Lei, Yan-Bao; Xia, Hong-Xia; Sun, Geng] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, CAS Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utiliz, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yan-Bao; Xia, Hong-Xia; Sun, Geng] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Lei, Yan-Bao; Xia, Hong-Xia; Sun, Geng] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, China Croatia Belt & Rd Joint Lab Biodivers & Eco, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Xia, Hong-Xia; Chen, Ke] Southwest Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci & Engn, Mianyang 621010, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Plenkovic-Moraj, Andelka] Univ Zagreb, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Rooseveltov Trg 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Huang, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chengdu Institute of Biology, CAS; Southwest University of Science & Technology - China; University of Zagreb; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Kunming Institute of Botany, CAS","Sun, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, CAS Key Lab Mt Ecol Restorat & Bioresource Utiliz, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.;Sun, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, Biodivers Conservat Key Lab Sichuan Prov, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.;Sun, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, China Croatia Belt & Rd Joint Lab Biodivers & Eco, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.;Huang, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China.","huangwei@mail.kib.ac.cn; sungeng@cib.ac.cn","","Huang, Wei/0000-0003-1854-6995","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2020YFE0203200]; Sichuan Science & Technology Bureau [2021ZHYZ0002, 2021YFH0008, 2020YFH0215]; Jiuzhaigou Post-Disaster Restoration and Reconstruction Program Experimental Research on Using Moss to Artificially Greening Bare Rock and Sharp Slopes after Earthquake in Jiuzhaigou","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Sichuan Science & Technology Bureau; Jiuzhaigou Post-Disaster Restoration and Reconstruction Program Experimental Research on Using Moss to Artificially Greening Bare Rock and Sharp Slopes after Earthquake in Jiuzhaigou","This study was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2020YFE0203200), Sichuan Science & Technology Bureau (2021ZHYZ0002, 2021YFH0008, 2020YFH0215), and Jiuzhaigou Post-Disaster Restoration and Reconstruction Program Experimental Research on Using Moss to Artificially Greening Bare Rock and Sharp Slopes after Earthquake in Jiuzhaigou.",NA,"49","5","5","3","33","ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD","CLARE","ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND","0168-9452","1873-2259","","PLANT SCI","Plant Sci.","OCT","2021","311","","",NA,"",NA,"","","111020","10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.111020","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.111020","","AUG 2021","8","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Plant Sciences","UK8TR","34482921","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000692238700005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In this study, 3 temperature levels (20, 25, and 30 degrees C) were used to analyze the effects of short-term high temperatures on the growth and metabolism of S. fusiforme seedlings. The results showed that, although S. fusiforme seedlings were tolerant to high-temperature shock, high temperature (30 degrees C) significantly reduced the electron transfer rate, nitrogen assimilation-related enzyme activities and soluble protein content in S. fusiforme seedlings. Moreover, the short-term high temperature induced more malondialdehyde content and enhanced superoxide dismutase activity and dark respiration rates. However, under high-temperature conditions (30 degrees C), peroxidase activity did not increase significantly when compared with the activity at 20 degrees C. This phenomenon was not conducive to the scavenging of intracellular reactive oxygen species, resulting in the gradual decay and death of young seedlings. The results of this study suggest that photosynthesis in seedlings is sensitive to a short-term increase in seawater temperature. Because of extreme temperature disturbances, including heat waves, the cultivation management of the economic seaweed presents challenges. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that the total tuber sprouting and rate were significantly increased after a shift of daily temperature fluctuation from 0 to 12 degrees C. Sprouting rate and percentage were significantly and consistently higher for the tubers originating from the upper 5 cm of the soil, compared with the tubers obtained from the layer of 50-150 mm for all the temperature treatments. Additionally, solarization seems potentially effective on purple nutsedge tuber sprouting, as long as it resulted not only to a soil temperature shift, but also to a high diurnal temperature variation.

Our objective was to investigate the photosynthetic adaptation to the combination of wide fluctuation in diurnal temperature, high photon flux densities (PFD) and low CO2 partial pressure encountered in these regions. At an ambient CO2 partial pressure of c. 17 Pa, maximal rates of CO2 uptake were low, ranging between 4 and 6 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Such rates, however, required high PFDs and were observed only at levels of 1500 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Carbon dioxide uptake was significantly inhibited when PFD was > 2000 pmol photons m(-2) s(-1). On the other hand, at saturating CO2 levels, maximal photosynthetic oxygen evolution was higher (30 mu mol O-2 m(-2) s(-1)), saturating at the same PFD as CO2 uptake. Quantum efficiency of CO2 uptake (0.006 mol CO2 mol photons(-1), at high altitude and a low CO2 partial pressure of 17 Pa) and even of oxygen evolution under CO2-saturating conditions in the leaf O-2 electrode (0.05 mol O-2 mol photons(-1)) indicated reduced photosynthetic efficiency. Electron transport rate (ETR) was strongly correlated with the leaf temperature. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) responded inversely to leaf temperature and stomatal conductance. The results indicated that in the morning, when the sun irradiates the partly frozen leaves with closed stomata, NPQ is the principal mechanism by which Lobelia leaves protect their photosynthetic apparatus. However, during the day, the predominant upright inclination of the leaves significantly contributes to protecting the leaves from excess light absorption. A comparison of the chlorophyll fluorescence of young and old leaves revealed that the former had high ETR and quantum efficiency of photosynthetic electron transport but a lower capacity for NPQ. Extremely high NPQ values but low ETR and low quantum efficiency were recorded for the old leaves. Thus, in the course of maturation the leaves apparently lose photosynthetic efficiency but increase their capability for protective non-photochemical quenching.","UNIV BAYREUTH,LEHRSTUHL PFLANZENPHYSIOL,D-95440 BAYREUTH,GERMANY; UNIV ADDIS ABABA,DEPT BIOL,ADDIS ABABA,ETHIOPIA; TH DARMSTADT,INST BOT,FACHBEREICH BIOL,D-64387 DARMSTADT,GERMANY","University of Bayreuth; Addis Ababa University; Technical University of Darmstadt","","","","","","","",NA,"38","23","23","0","17","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211","0028-646X","","","NEW PHYTOL","New Phytol.","NOV","1997","137","3","",NA,"",NA,"453","461","","10.1046/j.1469-8137.1997.00844.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.1997.00844.x","","","9","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","YJ639","33863076","Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1997YJ63900008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The activity of phytochrome in the field has typically been described by its photoequilibrium, defined by the photochemical properties of the pigment in combination with the spectral distribution of the light. This approach represents an oversimplification because phytochrome B (phyB) activity depends not only on its photochemical reactions but also on its rates of synthesis, degradation, translocation to the nucleus, and thermal reversion. To account for these complex cellular reactions, we used a model to simulate phyB activity under a range of field conditions. The model provided values of phyB activity that in turn predicted hypocotyl growth in the field with reasonable accuracy. On the basis of these observations, we define two scenarios, one is under shade, in cloudy weather, at the extremes of the photoperiod or in the presence of rapid fluctuations of the light environment caused by wind-induced movements of the foliage, where phyB activity departs from photoequilibrium and becomes affected by irradiance and temperature in addition to the spectral distribution. The other scenario is under full sunlight, where phyB activity responds mainly to the spectral distribution of the light.","[Sellaro, Romina; Casal, Jorge J.] Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculadas Agr IFEVA, Fac Agron, C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Sellaro, Romina; Casal, Jorge J.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Smith, Robert W.; Fleck, Christian] Wageningen UR, Lab Syst & Synthet Biol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Legris, Martina; Casal, Jorge J.] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Invest Bioquim Buenos Aires, Fdn Inst Leloir, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Fleck, Christian] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn D BSSE, Matthenstr 26, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland; [Legris, Martina] Univ Lausanne, Fac Biol & Med, Ctr Integrat Gen, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Wageningen University & Research; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Leloir Institute; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Lausanne","Casal, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Invest Fisiol & Ecol Vinculadas Agr IFEVA, Fac Agron, C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Casal, JJ (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, C1417DSE, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Fleck, C (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Biosyst Sci & Engn D BSSE, Matthenstr 26, CH-4058 Basel, Switzerland.","cfleck@ethz.ch; casal@ifeva.edu.ar","","Casal, Jorge/0000-0001-6525-8414; Legris, Martina/0000-0001-6725-2198; Sellaro, Romina/0000-0002-4412-1352","FP7 Marie Curie Initial Training Network [316723]; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [634942]; Human Frontier Science Program [RGP0025/2013]; HFSP [RGP0025/2013]; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica [PICT-2015-1796]; University of Buenos Aires [20020100100437]","FP7 Marie Curie Initial Training Network; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme; Human Frontier Science Program(Human Frontier Science Program); HFSP(Human Frontier Science Program); Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica(ANPCyT); University of Buenos Aires(University of Buenos Aires)","FP7 Marie Curie Initial Training Network, Grant/Award Number: 316723 to R.

This lake experiences daily and seasonal fluctuations in salinity, and seasonal changes in temperature. To determine the potential contributions of salinity and temperature to observed seasonal population fluctuations, we tested the survival and egg production of G. pectinatus at two temperatures (10 degreesC and 20 degreesC) and in a range of 'salinities' (20 to 2700 mg l(-1) Cl). Adult survival was highest in 1000 mg l(-1) Cl at 10 degreesC, when 50% still remained alive after 23 d. Increases in salinity and temperature decreased the survival time to less than 10 d. The salinities tolerated were well below the maximum of 2500 mg l(-1) Cl recorded in the lake. There was no difference in adult survival between males and females. Eggs were produced in salinities of up to 600 mg l(-1) Cl. Only in 20 mg l(-1) Cl did an increase in temperature reduce clutch retention time, and increase the rate of egg production. The rate of increase in salinity did not affect copepod survival, but acclimation at an intermediate salinity increased survival at 10 degreesC. Our results suggest that high temperatures and salinities in summer may lower the fitness of this population of G. pectinatus. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Phloem was collected from the cut stylets of aphids taken from plants that were grown outdoors. The total concentration of amino acids in P. padus phloem increased between bud break and late flush (spring), decreased in mature leaves (summer), and increased again in early senescent leaves (autumn). In H. vulgare, however, amino acid concentration fluctuated less from seedlings to flowering. Spring aphids from P. padus grew rapidly on this host from bud break to late flush, but died on mature and early senescent leaves. Summer aphids from H. vulgare grew as fast on this host as spring aphids did on flush leaves of P. padus. Sexual females grew more slowly than other generations and nearly as well on mature as on early senescent P. padus leaves. As judged by aphid growth and phloem nitrogen quality, P. padus during spring equals the summer host H. vulgare. However, the lower growth rates of R. padi on mature and senescent leaves of P. padus appear only loosely correlated with phloem amino acid concentrations. Therefore, factors influencing aphid nutrition, or ecology, other than seasonal changes in phloem sap amino acid concentration may explain the existence of host alternation in R. padi.","Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden","Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","Sandstrom, J (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Entomol, Box 7044, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.","jonas.sandstrom@entom.slu.se","","","","","",NA,"49","36","40","0","33","SPRINGER BASEL AG","BASEL","PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND","0937-7409","1423-0445","","CHEMOECOLOGY","Chemoecology","","2000","10","1","",NA,"",NA,"17","24","","10.1007/s000490050003","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000490050003","","","8","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","344KJ",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000088757500003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A steep tip-focused gradient occurs in all species examined, including Lilium longiflorum, Nicotiana sylvestris, and Tradescantia virginiana. Analysis of Lilium pollen tubes loaded with dextran conjugated fura-2 reveals that the gradient derives from Ca2+ entry that is restricted to a small area of plasma membrane at the extreme apex of the tube dome. Since the apical membrane is continually swept to the hanks during tube elongation, either Ca2+ channels are specifically retained at the extreme apex or, as seems more likely, the Ca2+ channels which were active at the tip vapidly inactivate, as new ones are inserted during vesicle fusion. Ratiometric imaging further indicates that the high point of the gradient fluctuates in magnitude from 0.75 to above 3 mu M, during measuring intervals of 60 sec, with the elevated points being correlated with an increased rate of tube growth. Independent analysis of the growth at 2- to 3-sec intervals reveals that the rates can fluctuate more than threefold; tubes longer than 700 mu m exhibit oscillations with a period of 23 sec, while tubes shorter than 700 mu m display erratic fluctuations. Inhibition of pollen tube growth caused by mild temperature shock or caffeine (1.5 to 3.0 mM) is correlated with the dissipation of the tip-focused gradient and the Ca2+ influx. Recovery from both treatments is denoted by a global swelling of the pollen tube tip, concomitant with a high transient entry of Ca2+ in the tip. The location of the highest Ca2+ domain within the tip region defines the point from which normal cylindrical elongation will proceed.

To better understand long-term ecological responses, we used paleoecological and microclimate data to investigate dynamics of late Holocene peatbank development and landscape influences. In peatbank cores from three locations on Litchfield Island (64 degrees 46'S; 64 degrees 06'W) high-resolution plant macrofossil and geochemical analysis show contrasting ecological and environmental changes. Two peatbanks on the southwest- and west-facing slopes of two separate hills are about 500 years old in contrast to a north-facing peatbank that is 2700 years old. The period from 1350 to 450 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP) at the north-facing peatbank had low accumulation (0.25 mm yr(-1), 36 g OM m(-2) yr(-1)), which we interpret as a period of low temperature and increased snow cover. Microclimate differences were amplified by this regional climate cooling, causing the delayed peat initiation on non-equator-facing slopes. Over the last 500 years, the north-facing peatbank had an accumulation rate (0.7 mm yr(-1), 76 g OM m(-2) yr(-1)) that was lower than the southwest- and west-facing peatbanks (1-1.4 mm yr(-1), 97-110 g OM m(-2) yr(-1)). Microclimate data suggest that slope aspect on Litchfield Island influences soil temperature, snow cover, and water availability that in turn affect growing-season lengths and peat accumulation. Plant macrofossils preserved in the north- and west-facing peatbanks show a centennial-scale pattern of fluctuation in relative abundance of dry-adapted Polytrichum strictum and wetter Chorisodontium aciphyllum mosses. Our results suggest that moss communities responded to external environmental influence, particularly those affecting moisture conditions, while topography and resultant microclimate differences had a strong influence on peat accumulation.

In this study, the influence of endogenous (density-dependent) and exogenous (density-independent) factors regulating population dynamics of the terrestrial plethodontid salamander Speleomantes strinatii was analysed by means of time series and multiple regression analyses. During the period 1993-2005, S. strinatii population abundance, estimated by a standardised temporary removal method, displayed relatively low fluctuations, and the autocorrelation function (ACF) analysis showed that the time series had a noncyclic structure. The partial rate correlation function (PRCF) indicated that a strong first-order negative feedback dominated the endogenous dynamics. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that the only climatic factor influencing population growth rate was the minimum winter temperature. Thus, at least during the study period, endogenous, density-dependent negative feedback was the main factor affecting the growth rate of the salamander population, whereas stochastic environmental variables, such as temperature and rainfall, seemed to play a minor role in regulation. These results stress the importance of considering both exogenous and endogenous factors when analysing amphibian long-term population dynamics.","Univ Genoa, DIPTERIS, I-16132 Genoa, Italy","University of Genoa","Salvidio, S (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, DIPTERIS, Corso Europa 26, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.","salvidio@dipteris.unige.it","","","","","",NA,"24","15","16","0","9","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0028-1042","1432-1904","","NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN","Naturwissenschaften","MAY","2007","94","5","",NA,"",NA,"396","400","","10.1007/s00114-006-0202-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-006-0202-2","","","5","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","159GA","17216185","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000245852200008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Water treatments, including control, continuous flooding (CF), and periodic flooding and drought (PF), were applied to seedlings in order to simulate water level fluctuation in the hydrofluctuation zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region. Results showed that net photosynthetic rate (P (N)), stomatal conductance, and intrinsic water-use efficiency of both plant species were negatively affected under CF and PF compared with the corresponding controls. The P (N) of both species under PF was comparable to that under CF. At the end of the experiment, the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration was not statistically different between water treatments, while that of P. elliottii was significantly higher than that of P. stenoptera. Although P. stenoptera formed lenticels under flooding conditions, P. elliottii seedlings allocated more mass to leaves and increased the relative growth rate of height to enhance the photosynthetic efficiency. Our results illustrated that P. stenoptera and P. elliottii seedlings developed different adaptive strategies in response to flooding, both CF and PF. Therefore, both P. stenoptera and P. elliottii are promising candidates for the vegetation reconstruction of the riparian zones in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region.","[Yang, Y.; Li, C.] Southwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Gorges Reservoir Reg 3, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China","Southwest University - China","Li, C (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Gorges Reservoir Reg 3, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.","lichangx@swu.edu.cn","yang, yujing/GXF-6999-2022; Changxiao, Li/ABF-6885-2020; Yang, Yujing/AAP-7313-2020","Yang, Yujing/0000-0003-4878-8063; Li, Changxiao/0000-0002-5090-6201","International Cooperation Program of Ministry of Science and Technology [2015DFA90900, 2011DFG32780]; Key Project of Chongqing Natural Science Foundation Program [CSTC-2013JJB00004]; Basic Research Fund for Central Universities [XDJK2013A011]; National Forestry Public Welfare Industry Research Special [201004039]; Chongqing Natural Science Foundation Program [CSTC-2012jjA80003]; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Students [2010-1561]","International Cooperation Program of Ministry of Science and Technology; Key Project of Chongqing Natural Science Foundation Program; Basic Research Fund for Central Universities; National Forestry Public Welfare Industry Research Special; Chongqing Natural Science Foundation Program; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Students(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars)","This research was funded by the International Cooperation Program of Ministry of Science and Technology (No. 2015DFA90900, 2011DFG32780), the Key Project of Chongqing Natural Science Foundation Program (CSTC-2013JJB00004), Basic Research Fund for Central Universities (No. XDJK2013A011), National Forestry Public Welfare Industry Research Special (No. 201004039), Chongqing Natural Science Foundation Program (CSTC-2012jjA80003), and Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Students (2010-1561).

It is well known that shoot growth rates can be strongly influenced by availability of carbohydrates to support growth. Additionally, carbohydrate availability for vegetative growth is influenced by crop load, since fruits are strong sinks for photosynthates. Thus, while crop load is known to have significant effects on shoot growth rates it is not clear whether this effect is limited to extension growth rates of internodes or whether it also affects shoot development such as the rate at which nodes are added to shoots, i.e., the phyllochron. In this study, we investigated the effect of the presence and absence of the crop on the phyllochron of proleptic and epicormic shoots on mature, field-grown peach trees. Leaf growth measurements were recorded three times per week from the beginning to the end of the growing season and used to calculate the phyllochron on trees from two treatments; one with 100% of the crop left on it (unthinned or fully cropped) and a treatment of trees where the crop was completely removed (non-cropped). The phyllochron fluctuated but generally increased over the season due to a rank effect. The phyllochron was longer on trees with heavy crop loads. Although there were large differences in phyllochrons between treatments in both shoot types, only differences observed in epicormic shoots were statistically significant. Additionally, leaf length and leaf area were also significantly reduced by crop load in both shoot types. These findings indicate that the phyllochron of field-grown peach trees is apparently sensitive to carbohydrate availability in the tree and should be considered when trying to accurately predict the timing of the addition of new phytomers along a shoot.","[Davidson, Anna; Da Silva, David; DeJong, Theodore M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","University of California System; University of California Davis","Davidson, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","adavidson@ucdavis.edu","","","","","",NA,"49","1","1","0","12","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0931-1890","1432-2285","","TREES-STRUCT FUNCT","Trees-Struct.

Marine intertidal organisms possess the ability to cope in the short term with environmental fluctuations exceeding predicted values. However, how they will cope with chronic exposure to elevated temperature and pCO(2) is virtually unknown. In addition, individuals from the same species/population often show remarkable levels of variation in their responses to complex climatic changes: in particular, variation in metabolic rates often is linked to differences in individuals' performances and fitness. Despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, inter-individual variation has rarely been investigated within the context of climatic changes, and most investigations have typically employed orthogonal experimental designs paired to analyses of independent samples. Although this is undoubtedly a powerful and useful approach, it may not be the most appropriate for understanding all alterations of biological functions in response to environmental changes. An individual approach arguably should be favored when trying to describe organisms' responses to climatic change. Consequently, to test which approach had the greater power to discriminate the intensity and direction of an organism's response to complex climatic changes, we investigated the extracellular osmo/iono-regulatory abilities, upper thermal tolerances (UTTs), and metabolic rates of individual adults of an intertidal amphipod, Echinogammarus marinus, exposed for 15 days to combined elevated temperature and pCO(2). The individual approach led to stronger and different predictions on how ectotherms will likely respond to ongoing complex climatic change, compared with the independent approaches. Consequently, this may call into question the relevance, or even the validity, of some of the predictions made to date. Finally, we argue that treating individual differences as biologically meaningful can lead to a better understanding of the physiological responses themselves and the selective processes that will occur with complex climatic changes; selection will likely play a crucial role in defining species' responses to future environmental changes. Individuals with higher metabolic rates were also characterized by greater extracellular osmo/iono-regulative abilities and higher UTTs, and thus there appeared to be no evolutionary trade-offs between these functions. However, as individuals with greater metabolic rates also have greater costs for maintenance and repair, and likely a lower fraction of energy available for growth and reproduction, trade-offs between life-history and physiological performance may still arise.","[Calosi, P.; Turner, L.

The measurements were performed in a young (5-years-old irrigated olive orchard (cv. Cornicabra) in Ciudad Real, Spain). MDS agreed well with Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) (R-2=0.89***; MDS=0.35VPD) with one year of data. The MDS-VPD relationship was the same during all the season though other authors reported variations in olive trees with great harvest (we obtained around 8 kg per tree). TGR showed a continuous increase until full bloom (Day of the Year (DOY) 148), then decreased sharply until day 190, when values oscillated between 0.1-0.15 mm day(-1). Changes in TGR were evaluated in relation to temperature and fruit development. In the phase of great increase, TGR related closely to mean temperature (R-2=0.82***, TGR=-0.14+0.014 Tmean). No agreement was found, however, when the pooled data of TGR values were used. The decrease in TGR values from DOY 155 until DOY 190 corresponded with pit development. Structural measurements showed steady endocarp expansion from, at least, DOY 171, with maximum endocarp size, associated with the intensification of pit hardening at DOY 192.

However, water level requirements (WLRs) of these plants are not well studied. In the present study, we conducted a systematic assessment of WLRs of Carex cinerascens regarding to each life history stage, based on field investigations and a series of simulation experiments in the Yangtze River floodplain. Results showed that C. cinerascens was well developed in lakes with intermittent water level fluctuations. Its rhizomes could not emerge underwater or in water-saturated conditions, and the optimum soil moisture for emergence was 15-30% with air temperature above 6 degrees C. Its growth was prohibited when the whole plant was inundated (i.e. inundation depth > plant height), and when rate of water level change exceeded 1.2 cm/d. Although summer inundation was not essential for C. cinerascens development, it was beneficial to the plant for excluding competitive species. The timing of habitat inundation was suggested to be after May when the plant matured. The timing of rhizome emergence in the second growing season was determined by when the habitat was exposed. With inclusion of temperature limits, the optimum timing of habitat exposure in autumn was October, and the duration of summer inundation was therefore 0-150 days. We finally combined WLRs of each life history stage and established an integrated WLRs model of C. cinerascens in Yangtze floodplain lakes. It is the first time that such a WLRs model was proposed for hygrophytes in lakes. Moreover, we presented a methodology for assessment of WLRs of hygrophytes which can be widely used in riverine lakes as well as other wetlands. Our results provide important implications for water level management regarding the conservation and rehabilitation of wetland plants.","[Yuan, Saibo; Yang, Zhendong; Liu, Xueqin; Wang, Hongzhu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, State Key Lab Freshwater Ecol & Biotechnol, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Saibo; Yang, Zhendong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, XQ; Wang, HZ (corresponding author), 7 Donghu South Rd, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.","xqliu@ihb.ac.cn; wanghz@ihb.ac.cn","Liu, Xueqin/F-9565-2013","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371054, 51579234]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41371054 and 51579234).",NA,"52","19","25","9","74","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0925-8574","1872-6992","","ECOL ENG","Ecol.

Hartm., U. stygia Thor and U. bremii Heer ex Kolliker (Lentibulariaceae, Lamiales) are the four rarest and critically endangered European Utricularia (bladderwort) species from the generic section Utricularia. They are aquatic, submerged or amphibious carnivorous plants with suction traps which grow in very shallow, standing dystrophic (humic) waters such as pools in peat bogs and fens (also pools after peat or fen extraction), shores of peaty lakes and fishponds; U. bremii also grows in pools in old shallow sand-pits. These Utricularia species with boreal circumpolar distribution (except for U. bremii) are still commonly growing in northern parts of Europe (Scandinavia, Karelia) but their recent distribution in Central Europe is scarce to very rare following a marked population decline over the last 120 years. All species have very thin linear shoots with short narrow to filamentous leaves bearing carnivorous traps (bladders, utricles) 1-5 mm large. The first three species form distinctly dimorphic shoots differentiated into pale carnivorous ones bearing most or all traps, and green photosynthetic shoots with only a few (or without) traps, while the last species usually forms non-differentiated (monomorphic) or slightly differentiated shoots. The plants exhibit a marked physiological polarity along their linear shoots with rapid apical shoot growth. Their very high relative growth rate is in harmony with the record-high net photosynthetic rate of their photosynthetic shoots. Flowering of these species is common under favourable conditions and is stimulated by high temperatures but only U. intermedia sets seeds; the other species are sterile due to pollen malformation. Some molecular-taxonomic studies indicate that U. ochroleuca and U. stygia might be hybrids between U. intermedia and U. minor. All species propagate mainly vegetatively by regular branching and reach high relative growth rates under favourable conditions. All species form spherical dormant winter buds (turions). Suction traps actively form negative pressures of ca. -0.22 to -0.25 bar. The traps are physiologically very active organs with intensive metabolism: as a result of the presence of abundant glands inside the traps, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from captured prey carcasses (quadrifid glands) or take part in pumping water out of the traps and producing negative pressure (bifid glands), their aerobic respiration rate is ca. 2-3 times higher (per unit biomass) than that of leaves. Although oxygen concentrations inside reset traps are (almost) zero, traps are inhabited by many microscopic organisms (bacteria, euglens, algae, ciliates, rotifers, fungi). These commensal communities create a functional food web and in traps with captured macroscopic prey, they act as digestive mutualists and facilite prey digestion. Traps secrete a great amount of organic substances (sugars, organic acids, aminoacids) to support these commensals ('gardening'). Yet the nutritional role of commensals in prey-free traps is still unclear. Quadrifid glands can also serve in the reliable determination of three species. Ecological requirements of U. intermedia, U. ochroleuca and U. stygia are very similar and include very shallow dystrophic waters (0-30 cm deep) with highly variable levels of dystrophy, common mild water level fluctuations, oligomesotrophic to slighly eutrophic waters, optimal pH values from 5.5 to 7.0 but always high free-CO2 concentrations of 0.8-1.5 mM. Limited data indicate that U. bremii is partly a stenotopic species preferring only slightly acidic to neutral (pH 6-7), very soft to slightly hard, oligo-mesotrophic waters. Yet it can grow well both in strongly dystrophic and clear waters, in peat bogs as well as sand-pits over peaty soil and clayish sand. Longterm, very low water levels in combination with habitat eutrophication, whatever the reason, leading to peat bog and fen infilling, are the most common and unfavourable ecological threads at the most sites of the four rare Utricularia species. However, ecological consequences of high-water level at the sites can be ambiguous for the populations: it reduces the strongly competitive cyperoid and graminoid species but can speed up site eutrophication. All four species are considered (critically) threatened in European countries and are usually under official species protection or their sites are protected. Regeneration of infilled fens or peat bogs and creation of shallow fen pools and canals in these mires, combined with (re)-introductions of these species have shown to be a very successful and efficient measure to protect the natural populations for many decades. Old shallow sand-pit pools have become outstanding substitution habitats for the protection of U. bremii.","[Adamec, Lubomir] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Dukelska 135, CZ-37901 Trebon, Czech Republic","Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Adamec, L (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Dukelska 135, CZ-37901 Trebon, Czech Republic.","lubomir.adamec@ibot.cas.cz","","","Czech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]","Czech Academy of Sciences(Czech Academy of Sciences)","The paper is dedicated to Miloslav Studnicka, Botanical Garden in Liberec, Czech Republic, on his 70th birthday and for his great merits in studying, conservation and popularization of carnivorous plants in the Czech Republic.

The effect of cutting frequency and white clover cultivar on stolen and leaf dynamics was studied throughout the,growing season in a field experiment. Mixtures of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover cultivars with different leaf sizes, cvs. Alice, Gwenda and Retor, were evaluated for white clover persistence at two cutting frequencies. Stolen dynamics, stolen survival, leaf and node appearance rate, branching, flowering and stolen elongation rate were analysed and related to white clover content and yield. There were clear seasonal fluctuations in stolen and leaf characteristics. Stolen elongation rate and appearance rates of nodes, leaves and branches declined in autumn. Temperature and irradiation explained a major part of the variation of stolen elongation rate and leaf appearance rate and 25% of the variation in stolen branching rate. Significant and consistent differences in yield and botanical composition were found between mixtures. Mixtures with cv. Alice had the highest total and white clover yield and the highest white clover content, whereas mixtures with cv. Retor had the lowest yield and the lowest white clover content. Stolen elongation rate and stolen internee length were significantly higher in cv. Alice than in the other white clover cultivars, whereas cv. Retor had a significantly higher percentage of leaves with damage caused by insects and slugs than the other cultivars. Little support was found for the hypothesis that branching characteristics are a key component of competitive success in mixed pasture, as most measured branching characteristics were not associated with differences in white clover yield between cultivars and cutting regimes.","Agr Univ Wageningen, Dept Agron, NL-6709 RZ Wageningen, Netherlands","Wageningen University & Research","Elgersma, A (corresponding author), Agr Univ Wageningen, Dept Agron, Haarweg 333, NL-6709 RZ Wageningen, Netherlands.","","Elgersma, Anjo/E-7261-2013","Elgersma, Anjo/0000-0002-7552-3231","","","",NA,"37","10","10","0","9","BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND","0142-5242","","","GRASS FORAGE SCI","Grass Forage Sci.","DEC","1997","52","4","",NA,"",NA,"370","380","","10.1111/j.1365-2494.1997.tb02369.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.1997.tb02369.x","","","11","Agronomy","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture","134ZR",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000076774500005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The Aedes albopictus mosquito as the vector of dengue fever surged exponentially in the last decade, raising ecological and epistemological concerns of how climate change altered its growth rate and population dynamics. As the global warming pattern is considerably uneven across four seasons, with a confirmed stronger effect in winter, an emerging need arises as to exploring how the seasonal warming effects influence the annual development of Ae. albopictus. Methods: The model consolidates a 35-year climate dataset and designs fifteen warming patterns that increase the temperature of selected seasons. Based on a recently developed mechanistic population model of Ae. albopictus, the model simulates the thermal reaction of blood-fed adults by systematically increasing the temperature from 0.5 to 5 degrees C at an interval of 0.5 degrees C in each warming pattern. Results: The results show the warming effects are different across seasons. The warming effects in spring and winter facilitate the development of the species by shortening the diapause period. The warming effect in summer is primarily negative by inhibiting mosquito development. The warming effect in autumn is considerably mixed. However, these warming effects cannot carry over to the following year, possibly due to the fact that under the extreme weather in winter the mosquito fully ceases from development and survives in terms of diapause eggs. Conclusions: As the historical pattern of global warming manifests seasonal fluctuations, this study provides corroborating and previously ignored evidence of how such seasonality affects the mosquito development. Understanding this short-term temperature-driven mechanism as one chain of the transmission events is critical to refining the thermal reaction norms of the epidemic vector under global warming as well as developing effective mosquito prevention and control strategies.","[Jia, Pengfei; Tan, Xiaoyue] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiang; Chen, Jin] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiang] Arkansas Tech Univ, Dept Emergency Management, Russellville, AR 72801 USA; [Lu, Liang; Liu, Qiyong] China CDC, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China","Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University; Arkansas Tech University; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; National Institute for Communicable Disease Control & Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention","Chen, X (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Chen, X (corresponding author), Arkansas Tech Univ, Dept Emergency Management, Russellville, AR 72801 USA.","chenxiangpeter@gmail.com","Chen, Xiang/F-8556-2015; Lu, Liang/HJY-5326-2023; Chen, Jin/A-6417-2011","Chen, Xiang/0000-0002-5045-9253; Chen, Jin/0000-0002-6497-4141; TAN, Xiaoyue/0000-0001-9989-0573","National Key Basic Research and Development Plan of China Ministry of Science and Technology [2012CB955501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China of China Ministry of Science and Technology [81273139]","National Key Basic Research and Development Plan of China Ministry of Science and Technology; National Natural Science Foundation of China of China Ministry of Science and Technology","The research was financially supported by National Key Basic Research and Development Plan (2012CB955501) of China Ministry of Science and Technology.

Metabolic rates and rate of development increased with temperature between 22 degrees C and 32 degrees C in both species. There was, however, no significant effect of temperature on cumulative oxygen consumption over the duration of metamorphosis for either species. Although M. sexta pupae are 10 times as large as T. molitor pupae, their mass-specific cost of metamorphosis (per gram of pharate adult) was similar to that of T. molitor. The large-scale histolysis and subsequent remodeling of tissues during metamorphosis makes it difficult to quantify the mass of metabolically active tissue in pupae. A mitochondrial index (MI) related to mitochondrial membrane surface area was calculated using rhodamine-123-labeled mitochondria from T. sexta pupae, yielding a measure of pupa oxidative capacity and, indirectly, the amount of active tissue in the pupa. Across development, MI fluctuated in a manner resembling (V) overdotO(2) curves from intact M. sexta. Although both MI and (V) over dotO(2) increased during the latter half of development, the increase in MI began earlier and was proportionally larger than the observed increase in (V) over dotO(2). This suggests that, through most of metamorphosis, M. sexta pupae probably have a substantial aerobic potential that remains unutilized until emergence of the adult moth.

Understanding links between this variability and bottom-up processes is an important goal for biological oceanographers. Because zooplankton stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta C-13) are potentially influenced by variability in phytoplankton nutrient utilization, primary production, and zooplankton trophic structure, they have the potential to elucidate links between bottom-up processes, food web structure, and abundance or species composition of higher trophic levels. Here we measure correlations between zooplankton stable isotopes and oceanographic variables in two time series from the west coast of Vancouver Island, upstream of the California Current upwelling system. We then relate interannual variability in zooplankton stable isotopes to interannual variability in zooplankton species composition. Zooplankton stable isotopes show striking patterns of seasonal, regional and interannual variability. A strong positive correlation between annual averages of zooplankton delta N-15 and sea-surface temperature is evident in both time series. Zooplankton delta N-15 is also negatively correlated with interannual anomalies of subarctic copepod biomass in both time series. We propose two different mechanisms to explain these correlations: variability in the strength and direction of horizontal advection, or local fluctuations nutrient availability. We conclude that they are most likely caused by local, temperature-driven fluctuations in nitrate concentrations and primary production. We show that the positive correlation between zooplankton delta N-15 and temperature is widespread, extending to regions outside of the California Current system. Our findings suggest that interannual variability in zooplankton composition is linked with bottom-up variability in nitrate availability and primary production in the upstream portion of the California Current system. Our results also highlight the potential of integrating biochemical parameters in zooplankton time series for elucidating links between bottom-up processes and the survival of higher trophic levels in the ocean.

It can be observed that similarly to most weeds germinating under field condition, it also has a seasonal pattern. In 1998 and 1999 the emergence of Mercurialis annua began even before the emergence of maize, at the end of April. The peak of emergence was in May and June. The most intensive period in field emergence was in the middle of June (45 and 83 seedling per m(2), respectively). The 80-85% of the total number of seedlings, germinated in a vegetation period emerged within 10 weeks after the sowing of maize. Later the germination decreased and practically ceased in November. It seemed that the temperature was the main factor in regulating periodicity of germination. The change of leaf area and dry weight during the vegetation period could be described with a logistic function. The calculated growth indices fluctuated and decreased at the end of the vegetation period. The high relative growth rate (RGR) values in the first part of the vegetation period suggest the strong competitive ability of this weed. The maximum values of relative leaf growth rate (RLGR) and net assimilation rate (NAR) were at the beginning of the development. The value of leaf area ratio (LAR) was the highest in early June, when the plants had 8-10 leaves (216.4 cm(2)/g), after that it decreased until the end of vegetation period.","Mol Chem Ltd, Agrochem Off, H-9011 Gyor, Hungary; Pannon Univ Agr Sci, Inst Plant Protect, H-8361 Keszthely, Hungary","Eotvos Lorand Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Agricultural Research; University of Pannonia","Magyar, L (corresponding author), Mol Chem Ltd, Agrochem Off, POB 13, H-9011 Gyor, Hungary.","","","","","","",NA,"33","2","2","0","2","EUGEN ULMER GMBH CO","STUTTGART 70","POSTFACH 700561 WOLLGRASWEG 41, W-7000 STUTTGART 70, GERMANY","0340-8159","","","Z PFLANZENK PFLANZEN","Z.

The water demand is accurately reproduced by the passive leaf evaporation process described by Penman and Monteith (PM model). The mineral demand is tentatively described by Scaife's Pump-Leak-Buffer (PLB) model. The PLB model predicts for rose plants, contrary to ryegrass, little phase shift between mineral-absorption and solar radiation; as a consequence, it excludes memory effects from the previous day. But some observed features are not accounted for: the saturation of nitrate reduction rate at high solar radiation, the inhibition of root mineral absorption at high temperature. A modified PLB model (MPLB) is thus proposed, which accurately reproduces nitrate uptake fluctuations under strongly varying climatic conditions. Combining PM and MPLB models enables a modelling of the instantaneous absorption-concentration of nitrates in rose plants. It should then be feasible to manage in real time the composition of the root medium used in soilless cultures, so that neither saline stress nor mineral deficiency could affect plant growth.","Univ Batna, Unite Rech, Lab Energie Solaire, Batna, Algeria","University of Batna","Bougoul, S (corresponding author), Univ Batna, Unite Rech, Lab Energie Solaire, Rue Chahid Mohamed El Hadi Boukhlouf, Batna, Algeria.","","","","","","",NA,"10","14","15","0","1","EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES MEDICALES ELSEVIER","PARIS CEDEX 15","23 RUE LINOIS, 75724 PARIS CEDEX 15, FRANCE","0249-5627","","","AGRONOMIE","Agronomie","MAR","2000","20","2","",NA,"",NA,"165","174","","","","","","10","Agronomy","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture","300ZV",NA,"Green Submitted","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000086284400004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Natural fluctuations in ambient environmental conditions influence the intrinsic characteristics of gametes, which define their ability to tolerate varied conditions. The aim of this work was to document seasonal patterns in reproduction and gametophyte growth and survival of Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh in south-western Australia. These results were related to patterns in local environmental conditions in an attempt to ascertain which factors explain variation throughout the season. E. radiata was fertile (produced zoospores) for three and a half months over summer and autumn. Every two weeks during this time, gametophytes were grown in a range of temperatures (16-22 degrees C) in the laboratory. Zoospore densities were highly variable among sample periods; however, zoospores released early in the season produced gametophytes which had greater rates of growth and survival, and these rates declined towards the end of the reproductive season. Growth rates of gametophytes were positively related to day length, with the fastest growing recruits released when the days were longest. Gametophytes consistently survived best in the lowest temperature (16 degrees C), yet exhibited optimum growth in higher culture temperatures (20-22 degrees C). These results suggest that E. radiata releases gametes when conditions are favourable for growth, and E. radiata gametophytes are tolerant of the range of temperatures observed at this location. E. radiata releases the healthiest gametophytes when day length and temperature conditions are optimal for better germination, growth, and sporophyte production, perhaps as a mechanism to help compete against other species for space and other resources.","[Mohring, Margaret B.; Kendrick, Gary A.; Wernberg, Thomas; Rule, Michael J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Mohring, Margaret B.; Kendrick, Gary A.; Wernberg, Thomas; Rule, Michael J.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst M096, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Wernberg, Thomas] Univ Western Australia, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Rule, Michael J.] Dept Environm & Conservat, Kensington, NSW, Australia; [Vanderklift, Mathew A.] CSIRO Wealth Oceans Flagship, Floreat, WA, Australia","University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; Australian Institute of Marine Science; University of Western Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)","Mohring, MB (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia.","margie.mohring@gmail.com","Kendrick, Gary Andrew/B-3460-2011; Wernberg, Thomas/B-4172-2010; Vanderklift, Mathew A/B-1003-2008","Kendrick, Gary Andrew/0000-0002-0276-6064; Wernberg, Thomas/0000-0003-1185-9745; Vanderklift, Mathew A/0000-0002-5170-7546; Rule, Michael/0000-0001-7278-8317","University of Western Australia; Australian Geographic Society; Australian Research Council","University of Western Australia; Australian Geographic Society; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This study was supported by the University of Western Australia (Australian Postgraduate Award to MM), the Australian Geographic Society (Seed Grant to MM) and the Australian Research Council (Future Fellowship to TW).

Soil CO2 efflux occurs via a combination between the metabolism of soil microorganisms and the respiration of plant roots. It releases around 10 times more CO2 than all anthropogenic factors combined. For this reason, diurnal and seasonal carbon efflux rates were measured in Lithuanian Scots pine (P. sylvestris) forests to determine soil CO2 efflux rates and the relative importance of various climatic factors that can influence belowground conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the factors that have the strongest influence on variation in forest soil CO2 efflux and the mutual influence between the factors, in order to attain a clearer understanding of C sinks. We took measurements of soil CO2 efflux to examine diurnal and seasonal variation. For the continuous measurement of CO2 efflux, an ADC BioScientific LCpro+ soil respiration analysis system was used. The main parameters that were measured were CO2 efflux (mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), air temperature (degrees C) in the chamber, soil temperature (degrees C) at a depth of 10 cm and water evaporation (mmol m(-2) s(-1)). The diurnal rate values fluctuated within a certain range (2.78-6.17 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), while seasonal variations fluctuated more, but the average CO2 efflux rate was between 2-4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The highest CO2 efflux rate recorded during daytime was from 16:00-20:00, and the lowest one was early in the morning, between 05:00-08:00. During the seasonal soil CO2 efflux study, it was found that peak forest growth was related to peak efflux rates. These rates were observed from early to mid-June. The collected data suggest that SM (soil moisture) has a weaker connection with the efflux rate but had an impact on Ts (soil temperature), dampening its effect on soil CO2 efflux. These results demonstrate that the soil CO2 efflux of P. sylvestris forests in the cool climatic zone of Lithuania depend most heavily on soil temperature and soil moisture.","[Kucinskas, Osvaldas; Marozas, Vitas] Vytautas Magnus Univ, Fac Forest Sci & Ecol, Agr Acad, Vytautas, Lithuania","Vytautas Magnus University","Kucinskas, O (corresponding author), Vytautas Magnus Univ, Agr Acad, LT-53361 Vytautas, Lithuania.","osvaldaskucinskas@gmail.com","","","Research Council of Lithuania [S-LJB-20-3]","Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT))","This work was supported by the Research Council of Lithuania (Project BioRes No. S-LJB-20-3).",NA,"52","0","0","1","9","POLISH SOCIETY MAGNESIUM RESEARCH","OLSZYTN","UNIV WARMIA-MAZURY OLSZTYN, PLAC LODZKI 2, OLSZYTN, PLS 10-957, POLAND","1644-2296","","","J ELEMENTOL","J.

This effect could be influenced by climate variability, especially in regions with harsh climate, such as subalpine zones. In particular, short-term extreme weather fluctuations may induce rapid plant responses, affecting in turn the response to mowing. We tested the effects of concomitant summer weather manipulation and mowing on a subalpine grassland in the Central French Alps for two consecutive years. We addressed two questions: (1) How is a subalpine grassland affected by extreme summer weather? (2) Does extreme summer weather alter mowing effects on the grassland plant diversity and functioning? We used a multi-level, integrative approach assessing the responses of six abundant plant species, as well as effects on plant community structure, biomass production, and litter decomposition rates. Extreme summer weather was simulated by increasing summer temperature by 1.1A degrees C, and decreasing summer rainfall by 80%-resulting in a 30% decrease in total annual precipitation. In addition, a heat-wave event was simulated during the first year of the experiment. This weather manipulation was combined with a late-summer mowing treatment (mown vs. unmown). Extreme summer weather mainly increased leaf senescence and decreased plant vegetative growth. Leaf litter decomposition was slowed, but only for species characterized by the fastest rates of litter decomposition. Mowing increased plant diversity by restricting the dominant grass species, thereby favoring subordinates. In the short term, this subalpine grassland was rather resistant to extreme summer weather, whereas mowing cessation remained the main factor affecting its biodiversity.","[Benot, Marie-Lise; Saccone, Patrick; Pautrat, Emmanuelle; Vicente, Rachel; Colace, Marie-Pascale; Clement, Jean-Christophe; Lavorel, Sandra] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMR 5553, Lab Ecol Alpine, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Grigulis, Karl] Univ Grenoble 1, CNRS, UMS 3370, Stn Alpine Joseph Fourier, F-38041 Grenoble 9, France; [Saccone, Patrick] Univ Oulu, Dept Biol, Oulu 90014, Finland","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universite de Savoie; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); UDICE-French Research Universities; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); University of Oulu","Benot, ML (corresponding author), Univ Bordeaux, BIOGECO, UMR1202, Batiment B2,Ave Fac, F-33405 Talence, France.","marie-lise.benot@u-bordeaux1.fr","CLEMENT, Jean-Christophe/C-8589-2011; Saccone, Patrick/AHB-2366-2022; Alpes, Zone Atelier Alpes LTER/P-4132-2015","CLEMENT, Jean-Christophe/0000-0002-0841-7199; Saccone, Patrick/0000-0001-8820-593X; ","project ANR AAP VMC VALIDATE; project MEDDTL GICC2 SECALP","project ANR AAP VMC VALIDATE(French National Research Agency (ANR)); project MEDDTL GICC2 SECALP(French National Research Agency (ANR))","This research was conducted on the long-term research site Zone Atelier Alpes, a member of the ILTER-Europe network.

However, their effects may be different depending on plant species and developmental stage. This study investigates the effects of sudden weather worsening on the daily dynamics of kiwifruit berry growth, at different times during the season. Phloem, xylem and transpiration flows to/from the berry were continuously monitored for several days at about 5, 9, 11 and 15 weeks after full bloom (WAFB), on two consecutive years, while air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation anti rain were simultaneously recorded. From these data vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was also calculated. For each period considered, the daily amounts and the daily patterns of kiwifruit berry relative growth rate (RGR) and vascular flows were compared between two subsequent days having high (HVPD) and low (LVPD) mean VPDs, respectively. During all periods, daily water exchanges were linearly related to VPD although these relationships showed decreasing slopes during the season. At 5 and 9 WAFB daily and hourly rates of xylem and transpiration flows were highly reduced by LVPD conditions, while phloem flow was not affected by such changes during the whole season. Also, LVPD conditions affected the typical daily fluctuations in the berry RGR by reducing its morning shrinkage and slowing down its afternoon growth rates. This study shows how in the early stages of kiwifruit berry growth, weather worsening highly reduces the berry water exchanges by xylem and transpiration, but does not affect its phloem imports in the short-period.

Increased complexity leads to multiple dimensions and parameters. In turn this creates issues relating to integration. The questions what to include? and how to include? cell based interactions for an improved model become the focus of this study. In exploration of this, we further develop a grid cell based model of the spread and growth of the green alga Caulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) C. Agardh for Australian waters by adding new levels of complexity relating to cell interaction. C. taxifolia is a marine, green, seaweed that is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical waters throughout the world. However, invasive strains of the seaweed have been found in southern waters in Australia and they appear to be having some impacts on some native marine species. C. taxifolia is very difficult to contain and spreads at rapid rates. The main aim of the study is to model the spread of C. taxifolia, by taking into account biological and environmental factors of growth and in doing so predict the likely direction of spread in an estuary or lake. Foundation models have been developed based upon the discrete form of the diffusion equation but which relied only on the current biomass. These models only considered average growth and spread and ignored environmental factors influencing the advancement of the seaweed in the waterway. This study implements ways to improve the predictive capabilities of models by including spatial and temporal aspects of growth and spread and by including C. taxifolia responses to seasonal weather patterns and temperature and nutrient changes. In addition, the spread of the plant due to the bathymetric and biological factors are considered. The new dimensions of cell interaction, particularly the inclusion of the growth function, which varies seasonally, produced results that better reflected the observed data. Also, incorporation of vegetation distribution in the lake, used to indicate nutrient rich areas where C. taxifolia might thrive, wind direction and speed information and depth limitations have allowed for a significant improvement in the cell models predictive capabilities. In the case of seasonal fluctuations, variations outside the carrying capacity of cells created new problems with interpreting and comparing simulated results with the observed data. The model was validated using the real growth data for several estuarine lagoons in New South Wales, Australia. We test the model on two waterways, Lake Conjola (including Berringer Lake) and Narrawallee Inlet, both of which are located in New South Wales, Australia. Accurately representing the spread and growth using available information becomes particularly important in these waterways where locating outbreaks for eradication requires a large amount of resources.

Bacterial abundance fluctuated from 1.0 to 2.6 x 10(5) cells mL(-1). Cell density was not different between the pre-bloom and bloom periods, and showed no clear temporal pattern. Potential growth (g') and mortality (m) varied from 1.11 to 2.39 day(-1) and from 1.21 to 2.16 day(-1), respectively. Neither g' nor m was correlated with water temperature or chlorophyll a. Apparent growth rate in unenriched 100% seawater incubations (g(o)) was not limited by nutrients throughout the study period and was comparable to net growth rate (g' - m) estimates from dilution experiments. These results suggest that bacterial abundance is nearly steady-state in the pre-bloom and bloom period, because bacterial growth is nearly nutritionally saturated and balanced with high mortality.

However, there has been little research regarding geophytes on green roofs. This experiment was conducted to study the performance of 26 species of geophytes on a green roof during 2005-2006 in Sheffield, UK. The geophytes were grown at two substrate depths (5 cm and 10 cm) of substrate on a green roof without irrigation. To investigate the susceptibility of geophytes to competition from a covering of permanent plants, the geophytes were grown with or without a surface vegetation layer of Sedum album. Overall, the growth, survival rate, regeneration and flowering of geophytes were more successful at a substrate depth of 10 cm than of 5 cm, probably because of improved moisture retention, fewer temperature fluctuations and the protection from digging by animals. The flowering period was limited to spring, therefore, it is recommended to combine with other plant species such as covering plants. Geophyte species did not compete much with S. album and Sedum cover had no significant effects on the growth, survival rate, regeneration and flowering of geophytes in most species. Iris bucharica, Muscari azureum, Tulipa clusiana var. chrysantha, Tulipa humilis, Tulipa tarda and Tulipa turkestanica had good performance at the substrate depth of 5 cm. In addition, Narcissus cyclamineus 'February gold' and Tulipa urumiensis exhibited a successful performance at the substrate depth of 10 cm. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Drops followed by spikes in the food-to-mass ratio (0.18 to 0.52) and biochemical oxygen demand concentrations in primary effluent (94 to 298 mg liter(-1)) occurred at the initiation of G. amarae-like bacterial growth. The total bacterial concentration did not increase as concentrations of G. amarae-like cells increased, but total bacterial cell concentrations fluctuated in a manner similar to that of G. amarae-like bacteria in the pseudo-steady state. The ammonium ion removal rate (percent) was inversely related to G. amarae-like cell concentrations during accelerated growth and washout phases. The dissolved oxygen concentration decreased as the G. amarae-like cell concentration decreased. The concentrations of G. amarae-like cells peaked (2.47 x 10(9) cells liter(-1)) approximately 1.5 months prior to foaming. Foaming occurred during the late pseudo-steady-state phase, when temperature declines reversed. These findings suggested that temperature changes triggered operational and physicochemical changes favorable to the growth of G. amarae-like bacteria. Fine-scale quantitative PCR (qPCR) monitoring at weekly intervals allowed a better understanding of the factors affecting this organism and indicated that frequent sampling was required to obtain statistical significance with factors changing as the concentrations of this organism increased. Furthermore, the early identification of G. amarae-like cells when they are confined to mixed liquor (10(7) cells liter(-1)) allows management strategies to prevent foaming.","[Huang, Zhonghua; Olson, Betty H.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92717 USA; [Huang, Zhonghua] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Environm & Engn, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Asvapathanagul, Pitiporn] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Civil Engn & Construct Engn Management, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Gedalanga, Phillip B.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Baylor, Amber] Water Qual Lab, San Juan Capistrano, CA USA","University of California System; University of California Irvine; Nanjing University of Science & Technology; California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Olson, BH (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.","bholson@uci.edu","","Gedalanga, Phillip/0000-0003-0846-4486","Santa Margarita Water District, CA; U.S. National Science Foundation [1015730]","Santa Margarita Water District, CA; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was support by the Santa Margarita Water District, CA, and the U.S. National Science Foundation (fellowship award 1015730).",NA,"71","16","18","0","39","AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY","WASHINGTON","1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA","0099-2240","1098-5336","","APPL ENVIRON MICROB","Appl.

Endogenous factors are directly related to density-dependent forces, whereas exogenous factors are environmental drivers (e.g. climate). Several studies have reported the effects of endogenous and exogenous factors using exponential population models in mammals, birds or insects, but few works have explored the effects on reptiles, specifically in tortoises. In this study, we developed logistic population growth models to decipher the role of these factors on the population dynamics of the spur-thighed tortoise Testudo graeca. The role of environmental drivers in the distribution, movement, survival, reproduction or individual growth has been described for this species in previous works, but no studies have examined the effects of both endogenous and exogenous factors in population growth rates. Using long-term data of T. graeca in southeastern Iberian Peninsula (1999-2013), we fitted non-linear logistic models with endogenous and exogenous effects. The results showed that endogenous processes are important drivers of the population dynamics of this species, and that exogenous factors, such as freezing hours in winter, also directly affect the population growth rate. Intolerance of extreme winter temperatures may especially affect hatchlings and juvenile tortoises. Our models also showed that perturbations (i.e. a fire occurred during the monitoring period) have a lasting impact by reducing the carrying capacity of the population. This study shows that simple quantitative approaches based on population dynamic theory are useful for deciphering the ecological mechanisms underlying dynamics of tortoise populations.","[Rodriguez-Caro, R.

Evaluating the metabolic adjustments occurring under changing environmental conditions thus offers a good opportunity to increase our current understanding of the crosstalk between the major pathways which are affected by such conditions. To this end, plants growing under normal conditions were transferred to different light and temperature conditions which were anticipated to affect (amongst other processes) the rates of photosynthesis and photorespiration and characterized at the physiological, molecular, and metabolic levels following this transition. Our results revealed similar behavior in response to both treatments and imply a tight connectivity of photorespiration with the major pathways of plant metabolism. They further highlight that the majority of the regulation of these pathways is not mediated at the level of transcription but that leaf metabolism is rather pre-poised to adapt to changes in these input parameters.","[Florian, Alexandra; Nikoloski, Zoran; Sulpice, Ronan; Tohge, Takayuki; Fernie, Alisdair R.] Max Planck Inst Mol Pflanzenphysiol, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Sulpice, Ronan] NUIG, Plant Syst Biol Lab, Plant & AgriBiosci Res Ctr, Galway, Ireland; [Timm, Stefan; Bauwe, Hermann] Univ Rostock, Dept Plant Physiol, D-18059 Rostock, Germany; [Araujo, Wagner L.] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Biol Vegetal, BR-36570000 Vicosa, MG, Brazil","Max Planck Society; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University of Rostock; Universidade Federal de Vicosa","Fernie, AR (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Mol Pflanzenphysiol, Muhlenberg 1, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.","fernie@mpimp-golm.mpg.de","Araújo, Wagner L./I-3291-2013; Tohge, Takayuki/G-7924-2017; sulpice, ronan/I-2738-2013; Timm, Stefan/HII-7311-2022","Araújo, Wagner L./0000-0002-4796-2616; Tohge, Takayuki/0000-0001-5555-5650; sulpice, ronan/0000-0002-6113-9570; Timm, Stefan/0000-0003-3105-6296; Nikoloski, Zoran/0000-0003-2671-6763","Max Planck 682 Society; European Commission [245143]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft as part of PROMICS research group 1186","Max Planck 682 Society; European Commission(European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft as part of PROMICS research group 1186(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This work was supported by funding from the Max Planck 682 Society (W.L.A. and A.R.F.), the European Commission FP7 collaborative project TiMet under contract no. 245143 (R.S.), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft as part of PROMICS research group 1186 (A.F., S.T., H.B., and A.R.F.).",NA,"102","15","15","0","39","CELL PRESS","CAMBRIDGE","50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA","1674-2052","1752-9867","","MOL PLANT","Mol.

In surface mixed layers, phytoplankton may rapidly move between strong light and almost darkness. The nonlinear light-dependency of growth may differ between constant and fluctuating light because of the different frequency distribution of light and/or acclimation processes. The present study compares for the first time light-dependency of photosynthesis and growth of phytoplankton communities in situ under defined mixing conditions and at fixed depths. Maximum growth rates per day were not significantly different, but the growth efficiency was much higher under constant light than under fluctuating light of sub-saturating daily irradiance. Phytoplankton incubated under fluctuating light needed about three times higher mean daily irradiances to balance photosynthesis and losses than under constant light. The difference in growth efficiency was mostly caused by the different frequency distribution of underwater light, as was estimated by a photosynthesis model of sufficient temporal resolution. The present study indicates a considerable overestimation of phytoplankton growth at sub-saturating light in well-mixed water layers by the common growth measurements under constant light. This implies an underestimation of the compensation light intensities and respective overestimations of the critical mixing depths.","[Koehler, Jan; Guislain, Alexis; Shatwell, Tom] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany; [Wang, Lan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Hydrobiol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China","Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Hydrobiology, CAS","Kohler, J (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany.","koehler@igb-berlin.de","Köhler, Jan/C-2633-2014; Guislain, Alexis/AFO-0925-2022; Shatwell, Tom/ABF-1308-2020; Wang, Lan/AAH-1886-2019","Köhler, Jan/0000-0003-1894-2912; Shatwell, Tom/0000-0002-4520-7916; wang, lan/0000-0001-6843-3003; Guislain, Alexis Lucas Norbert/0000-0003-4176-4878","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [02WCL1336D]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","The experiments were conducted at the field station of the Institute of Hydrobiology, Wuhan, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In 2011, it appeared in Germany. In 2012, economic damage was recorded and, in 2014, the harvest of stone and soft fruits was lost in some regions. By contrast, during 2015, populations remained lower. Record temperatures and dryness might have impeded population growth during that year. 2 To test this hypothesis, flies were exposed to a 4-day simulation. We evaluated the effect of fluctuating temperature and humidity on mortality and reproduction of D. suzukii from three age classes (average age: class 1: 3days; class 2: 11days; class 3: 20days). Maximum temperatures were 27, 33 and 39 degrees C. Relative humidity oscillated between 18% and 85%. 3 Fly mortality through heat stress ranged from 50% to 80%. Higher rates died of oldest flies and females. Offspring per female did not differ between heat stressed and control groups. 4 Flies of both sexes were not sterilized through heat and dryness. Prior acclimation reduced any negative effects. 5 We concluded that heat waves and extreme dryness during 2015 were one cause of the low population densities of D. suzukii observed under field conditions.","[Eben, Astrid; Briem, Felix; Vogt, Heidrun] Inst Plant Protect Fruit Crops & Viticulture, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, JKI, Schwabenheimer Str 101, D-69221 Dossenheim, Germany; [Reifenrath, Maria] Heidelberg Univ, Fac Biosci, Neuenheimer Feld 234, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Pink, Sebastian] Mannheim Univ A5, Ctr European Social Res, D-668131 Mannheim, Germany","Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg","Eben, A (corresponding author), Inst Plant Protect Fruit Crops & Viticulture, Fed Res Ctr Cultivated Plants, JKI, Schwabenheimer Str 101, D-69221 Dossenheim, Germany.","astrid.eben@julius-kuehn.de","Briem, Felix/J-7770-2019","Briem, Felix/0000-0003-3873-8812","","","",NA,"49","24","24","0","44","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1461-9555","1461-9563","","AGR FOREST ENTOMOL","Agric.

This study focused on pilot-scale algal biomass production system development, cultivation process optimization, and integration with swine manure wastewater treatment. The areal algal biomass productivity for the cultivation system that we developed ranged from 8.08 to 14.59 and 19.15-23.19 g/m(2)xday, based on ash-free dry weight and total suspended solid (TSS), respectively, which were higher than or comparable with those in literature. The harvested algal biomass had lipid content about 1.77-3.55 %, which was relatively low, but could be converted to bio-oil via fast microwave-assisted pyrolysis system developed in our lab. The lipids in the harvested algal biomass had a significantly higher percentage of total unsaturated fatty acids than those grown in lab conditions, which may be attributed to the observed temperature and light fluctuations. The nutrient removal rate was highly correlated to the biomass productivity. The NH3-N, TN, COD, and PO4-P reduction rates for the north-located photo-bioreactor (PBR-N) in July were 2.65, 3.19, 7.21, and 0.067 g/m(2)xday, respectively, which were higher than those in other studies.

We quantitatively tested this ecological refuge paradigm at st unique stromatolite-reef complex at Stocking Island, Bahamas where three contiguous zones grade in dominance from stromatolites in the back reef to a macroalgal turf in the reef flat to reef building corals and coralline algae and reef fishes in the fore reef. At two independent transacts along this gradient, we quantified the distribution and abundance of the dominant organisms and measured the rates of the above-listed ecological processes and determined survival and growth of stromatolite, turf, and coralline algae transplanted to each of the three zones. We also measured both the sediment dynamics and temperature profiles along this gradient to determine if these may be controlling the ecological processes. Stromatolites dominate the back reef zone where species diversity (especially among eukaryotes) and associated ecological pressures were low. Measured rates of colonization from calcified (i.e., coralline) and noncalcified macroalgae and filamentous turf algae were lowest in the back reef (i.e., <5% substrate colonization/y) and highest in the fore reef (95% substrate colonization/y). This suggests that competition for space was lowest in the stromatolite zone. Growth and survival rates of transplanted coralline algae were low in both the back reef (3 mm/y and 20-40% annual survival rates) and reef flat (<2 mm/y, 0% surviving) and highest in the fore reef(about 10 mm/y, 80% surviving). Foraging activity from all fishes was lowest in the back reef (total 0.4 bites/m(2)/h) and reef flat (0 bites/m(2)/h) and highest in fore reef (900 -2200 bites/m(2)/h mostly from omnivorous wrasses). Herbivory from all potential sources was below detectable levels in the stromatolite zone and was highest in the fore reef. The ecological refuge found in the back reef stromatolite zone resulted primarily from periodic sediment inundation. Most eukaryotic reef-dwelling organisms cannot persist under as much as 700 mm of sediment for periods up to 100 days. Although the reef flat suffered both desiccation and thermal stress (averaging more than 5 degrees C greater daily temperature fluctuation than the fore reef), natural and transplanted eukaryotic turf algae thrived there. Although transplanted stromatolites survived best in the back reef (about 80% of the original transplant surviving/y), they also persisted in the fore reef (about 40% surviving per year). Therefore, Schizothrix-dominated stromatolites can persist in fore reef environments but because of the presence of other organisms and associated ecological pressures, their laminated microbial-produced structure is lost or obscured While the sediment and the organisms necessary for stromatolite formation exist in this and probably in other modem reef environments, their reef-building contribution will be low except in unusual habitats where abiotic stresses maintain an ecological refuge.","Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Sch Marine Sci, Walpole, ME 04573 USA; Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, MRC 125, Washington, DC 20560 USA","University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; University of Miami; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History","Steneck, RS (corresponding author), Univ Maine, Darling Marine Ctr, Sch Marine Sci, Walpole, ME 04573 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"45","17","17","1","16","NORTHEASTERN SCIENCE FOUNDATION INC","TROY","PO BOX 746, TROY, NY 12181-0746 USA","0891-2556","","","CARBONATE EVAPORITE","Carbonates Evaporites","","1998","13","1","",NA,"",NA,"48","65","","10.1007/BF03175434","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03175434","","","18","Geology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Geology","ZV172",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000074277300007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Here we compared how the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans responds to copper at constant temperatures (8-24 degrees C) and under fluctuation conditions of low (+/- 4 degrees C) and high (+/- 8 degrees C) amplitude (averages of 12, 16, 20 degrees C and 16 degrees C respectively). The DEBkiss model was used to interpret effects on energy budgets. Increasing constant temperature from 12-24 degrees C reduced time to first egg, life-span and population growth rates consistent with temperature driven metabolic rate change. Responses at 8 degrees C did not, however, accord with this pattern (including a deviation from the Temperature Size Rule), identifying a cold stress effect. High amplitude variation and low amplitude variation around a mean temperature of 12 degrees C impacted reproduction and body size compared to nematodes kept at the matching average constant temperatures. Copper exposure affected reproduction, body size and life-span and consequently population growth. Sensitivity to copper (EC50 values), was similar at intermediate temperatures (12, 16, 20 degrees C) and higher at 24 degrees C and especially the innately stressful 8 degrees C condition. Temperature variation did not increase copper sensitivity. Indeed under variable conditions including time at the stressful 8 degrees C condition, sensitivity was reduced. DEBkiss identified increased maintenance costs and increased assimilation as possible mechanisms for cold and higher copper concentration effects. Model analysis of combined variable temperature effects, however, demonstrated no additional joint stressor response. Hence, concerns that exposure to temperature fluctuations may sensitise species to co-stressor effects seem unfounded in this case.","[Cedergreen, Nina; Norhave, Nils Jakob] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Plant & Environm Sci, Thorvaldsensvej 40, DK-1871 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Svendsen, Claus; Spurgeon, David J.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Maclean Bldg,Benson Lane, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England","University of Copenhagen; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH)","Spurgeon, DJ (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Maclean Bldg,Benson Lane, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.","dasp@ceh.ac.uk","Svendsen, Claus/A-1250-2009; Spurgeon, David J/E-9466-2010; Cedergreen, Nina/F-6731-2014","Svendsen, Claus/0000-0001-7281-647X; Cedergreen, Nina/0000-0003-4724-9447; Spurgeon, David/0000-0003-3264-8760","Research School of Environmental Chemistry, Microbiology and Toxicology in Denmark; University of Copenhagen; Centre for Ecology and Hydrology National Capability funding; core NERC national capability funding under the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Pollution and Ecological Risk science theme; NERC [ceh020007] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research Council [ceh020007] Funding Source: researchfish","Research School of Environmental Chemistry, Microbiology and Toxicology in Denmark; University of Copenhagen; Centre for Ecology and Hydrology National Capability funding; core NERC national capability funding under the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Pollution and Ecological Risk science theme; NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","DJS and CS were supported by core NERC national capability funding under the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Pollution and Ecological Risk science theme.

Water shortage induces stomatal closure, causing a reduction in photosynthesis and transpiration rates. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emission is sensitive to subtle, stress-induced variations in non-photochemical quenching and in photosynthetic electron transport, caused by e.g., a fluctuation in the water availability. Based on this sensitivity, a framework for calibrating a water stress function in a crop growth model using ground-based SIF observations is proposed. SIF time series are simulated by coupling the AgroC crop growth model to the Soil Canopy Observations Photosynthesis Energy (SCOPE) model. This allowed parametrizing the water stress function in the AgroC crop growth model, resulting in improved estimates of actual evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange over a sugar beet stand during stressed periods. The improvement in the estimation of the water and carbon fluxes by AgroC during the summer months highlights the ability of canopyscale SIF observations to serve as a remote sensing metric to indicate the intensity of a stress condition. We argue that our framework, linking SIF emission to stress functions, can be used to extract information concerning drought stress from the Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) satellite, scheduled for launch in 2024.","[De Canniere, S.; Jonard, F.] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Croix Sud 2 Box L7-05-02, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Herbst, M.; Vereecken, H.; Defourny, P.; Jonard, F.] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Bio & Geosci, Agrosphere IBG 3, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Jonard, F.] Univ Liege ULiege, Geomat Unit, Allee Six Aout 19, B-4000 Liege, Belgium","Universite Catholique Louvain; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich","De Canniere, S (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Croix Sud 2 Box L7-05-02, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.","simon.decanniere@uclouvain.be","","Vereecken, Harry/0000-0002-8051-8517","Fonds pour la Formation a` la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture (FRIA, Belgium); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [EXC 2070 - 390732324]","Fonds pour la Formation a` la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture (FRIA, Belgium)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This research has been funded by the Fonds pour la Formation a` la Recherche dans l'Industrie et dans l'Agriculture (FRIA, Belgium) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany's Excellence Strategy - EXC 2070 - 390732324.",NA,"66","9","9","9","33","ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0034-4257","1879-0704","","REMOTE SENS ENVIRON","Remote Sens.

Wood formation of trees has the potential to adapt to those events by compensatory mechanisms between the rates and durations of tracheid differentiation to form the typical pattern of vital wood anatomical structures. We monitored xylogenesis and measured wood anatomy of mature silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees along an elevational gradient in the Black Forest during the hot drought year of 2018. We assessed the kinetics of tracheid differentiation and the final tracheid dimensions and quantified the relationship between rates and durations of cell differentiation over the growing season. Cell differentiation kinetics were decoupled, and temperature and water availability signals were imprinted in the tree ring structure. The sudden decline in woody biomass production provided evidence for a disruption in carbon sequestration processes due to heat and drought stress. Growth processes of Scots pine (pioneer species) were mainly affected by the spring drought, whereas silver fir (climax species) growth processes were more disturbed by the summer drought. Our study provides novel insights on the plasticity of wood formation and carbon allocation in temperate conifer tree species in response to extreme climatic events.","[Larysch, E.; Stangler, D.

Results showed that YLC35 had a higher maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-max) and photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE), while YLC29 had higher N content per area (N-a) and lower PNUE. YLC35, with lower malondialdehyde (MDA), had the highest proportions of N allocation in rubisco (P-r), bioenergetics (P-b), and photosynthetic apparatus (P-p), while YLC29, with the highest MDA, had the lowest P-r, P-b, and P-p, implying more leaf N allocated to the photosynthetic apparatus for boosting PNUE or to non-photosynthetic apparatus for alleviating damage. Structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrated that N allocation was affected negatively by leaf N and positively by photosynthesis, and their combination indirectly affected lipid peroxidation through the reverse regulation of N allocation.

BP after which the Be-10 concentrations are considered to reflect hillslope erosion and thus can be converted to denudation rates. These ones significantly fluctuated over this time period: lower hillslope erosion rates of ca. 0.4 mm/year dated between 5 and 7 kyr cal. BP correlate with a stable climate, sparse flooding events and elevated temperatures that favoured the widespread growth of stabilizing soils and vegetation. Higher hillslope erosion rates of ca. 0.8 mm/year over the last similar to 4 kyr correlate with a variable, cooler climate where frequent flooding events enhance denudation of less protected hillslopes. Overall, our results suggest a tight coupling of climate and hillslope erosion in alpine landscapes as it has been observed in other parts of the Alps.","[Grischott, Reto; Hajdas, Irka; Christl, M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Ion Beam Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Kober, Florian] Nagra, Int Serv & Prod, Vaud, Switzerland; [Lupker, Maarten; Willett, Sean D.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Geol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Reitner, Juergen M.] Geol Survey Austria, Vienna, Austria; [Drescher-Schneider, Ruth] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Plant Sci, Graz, Austria","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Graz","Grischott, R (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Ion Beam Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.","reto.grischott@phys.ethz.ch","Hajdas, Irka/C-6696-2011; Reitner, Jürgen/AAK-5747-2021; Willett, Sean D/B-1716-2008; Christl, Marcus/J-4769-2016","Hajdas, Irka/0000-0003-2373-2725; Reitner, Jürgen/0000-0001-6190-6736; Christl, Marcus/0000-0002-3131-6652; Lupker, Maarten/0000-0001-7609-6246"," [SNF 200021_135317/1]","","This study forms part of R.G.'s Ph.D. project, funded by a PhD grant from the SNF 200021_135317/1 granted to F.K.",NA,"77","10","10","1","6","SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","0959-6836","1477-0911","","HOLOCENE","Holocene","DEC","2017","27","12","",NA,"",NA,"1914","1927","","10.1177/0959683617708451","http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683617708451","","","14","Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Physical Geography; Geology","FP6DK",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000417713200009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We examined a physiological adaptation of these species by measurements of diurnal variation in photosynthesis and chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence and solute patterns in leaves during one season (June), which is favorable for plant growth of all four species. All four species adopted different strategies in order to utilize radiation and to maintain water status under a fluctuating microclimate. Although the lowest water contents among four plant species was found, E. mollis with a high Chl and K+ content showed better photosynthetic performance, with high stomatal conductance (g (s)), net photosynthetic rate (P (N)), instantaneous carboxylation efficiency (CE), and water-use efficiency. Midday depression of P (N) in E. mollis and G. littoralis, without a reduction of gs, was associated with a reduction in CE and maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII, indicating nonstomatal limitation. Photosynthesis depression in both C. kobomugi and V. rotundifolia, with relatively low g (s) values, could be attributed to both stomatal and nonstomatal limitations. The high storage capacity for inorganic ions in E. molli, C. kobomugi, and G. littoralis may play an efficient role in regulating photosynthesis and maintaining leaf water status through stomatal control, and can also play an important role in osmotic adjustment.","[Hwang, J. -S.; Choo, Y. -S.] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Daegu 41566, South Korea","Kyungpook National University","Choo, YS (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Daegu 41566, South Korea.","yschoo@knu.ac.kr","","","Eco-Innovation project and Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project of the Ministry of Environment, Korea","Eco-Innovation project and Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project of the Ministry of Environment, Korea(Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the Eco-Innovation project and Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project of the Ministry of Environment, Korea.",NA,"75","6","8","6","24","ACAD SCIENCES CZECH REPUBLIC, INST EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY","6 PRAGUE","NA KARLOVCE 1A,, 6 PRAGUE, 160 00, CZECH REPUBLIC","0300-3604","1573-9058","","PHOTOSYNTHETICA","Photosynthetica","MAR","2017","55","1","",NA,"",NA,"107","120","","10.1007/s11099-016-0232-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11099-016-0232-8","","","14","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","EL2HU",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000394441500012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Site-specific abiotic constraints, such as topography and demographic trends may make treelines less responsive to environmental fluctuations. A better understanding on how local processes modulate treelines' response to warming is thus required. We developed a model of treeline dynamics based on individual data of growth, mortality and reproduction. Specifically, we modeled growth patterns, mortality rates and reproductive size thresholds as a function of temperature and stand structure to evaluate the influence of climate- and stand-related processes on treeline dynamics. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of four Pyrenean mountain pine treeline sites with contrasting stand structures, and subjected to differing rates of climate warming. Our models indicate that Pyrenean treelines could reach basal areas and reproductive potentials similar to those currently observed in high-elevation subalpine forest by the mid twenty-first century. The fastest paces of treeline densification are forecasted by the late twenty-first century and are associated with higher warming rates. We found a common densification response of Pyrenean treelines to climate warming, but contrasting paces arise due to current size structures. Treelines characterized by a multistratified stand structure and subjected to lower mean annual temperatures were the most responsive to climate warming. In monostratified stands, tree growth was less sensitive to temperature than in multistratified stands and trees reached their reproductive size threshold later. Therefore, our simulations highlight that stand structure is paramount in modulating treeline responsiveness to ongoing climate warming. Synthesis. Treeline densification over the twenty-first century is likely to occur at different rates contingent on current stand structure and its effects on individual-level tree growth responses to warming. Accurate projections of future treeline dynamics must thus incorporate site-specific factors other than climate, specifically those related to stand structure and its influence on tree growth.","[Julio Camarero, J.] CSIC, IPE, Avda Montanana 1005,Apdo 202, Zaragoza 50192, Spain; [Carlos Linares, Juan] Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Sistemas Fis Quim & Nat, Ctra Utrera Km 1, Seville 41002, Spain; [Garcia-Cervigon, Ana I.] Univ Valladolid, EU Ingn Agr, Dept Ciencias Agroforestales, Los Pajaritos S-N, Soria 42004, Spain; [Batllori, Enric] CSIC CTFC CREAF, Forest Joint Res Unit, CEMFOR CTFC, Solsona 25280, Spain; [Batllori, Enric] CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Martinez, Isabel] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Nat Resources, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Gutierrez, Emilia] Univ Barcelona, Dept Ecol, Avda Diagonal 643, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto Pirenaico de Ecologia (IPE); Universidad Pablo de Olavide; Universidad de Valladolid; Centre Tecnologic Forestal de Catalunya (CTFC); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Rutgers State University New Brunswick; University of Barcelona","Camarero, JJ (corresponding author), CSIC, IPE, Avda Montanana 1005,Apdo 202, Zaragoza 50192, Spain.","jjcamarero@ipe.csic.es","Gutierrez, Emilia/O-7568-2014; Linares, Juan Carlos/G-3474-2011; Batllori, Enric/A-5695-2018; García-Cervigón, Ana I./F-5881-2016; Camarero, J.

Climate change can nevertheless, intensify the evapotranspiration of tree species, altering biodiversity, plant productivity and ecosystem services. Understanding the growth response of riparian tree species to climate change is, therefore, critical for their management and conservation. Here, we used 23 cross-dated stem discs of Anogeissus leiocarpus (DC.) Guill. and Perr. and Afzelia africana Sm. randomly sampled from riparian forests in the humid and dry savanna regions of Ghana to assess their growth response to climate change. A generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) was used to integrate species-specific basal area increments to an array of explanatory variables that may affect growth, including tree size and seasonal temperature and precipitation between 1982 and 2013. We observed significant association between tree size, rainy and dry season temperatures and precipitation variables, and changes in tree growth. Despite the strong fluctuations in tree growth over time, the estimated growth rates of the species from the residuals of the GAMMs showed no significant change in growth. Our findings suggest that these riparian forests are highly resistant to weather extremes and therefore, might persist (up to a certain point) even if climate change continues to intensify.","[Boakye, Emmanuel A.] Univ Quebec Montreal, Fac Sci, Montreal Quebec, Montreal, PQ H2X 3Y7, Canada; [Ceesay, Adam] Wetlands Int Africa, Rue 111,Villa 39,Zone B, Dakar, Senegal; [Osemwegie, Isimemen] Univ Bonn, Ctr Dev Res ZEF, Genscherallee 3, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Kapoury, Sanogo] Inst Rural Econ IER, BP 262, Sotuba, Bamako, Mali; [Hounkpevi, Achille] Univ Abomey Calavi, Fac Sci Agron, Lab Biomath & Estimat Forestieres, 04 BP 1525, Cotonou, Benin; [Matchi, Issiaka I.] Univ Diffa, Fac Sci Agron, Diffa, Niger; [Tetteh, Erasmus N.] Kwame Nkrumah Univ Sci & Technol KNUST, Fac Renewable Nat Resources, Kumasi, Ghana","University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Bonn; University of Abomey Calavi; Kwame Nkrumah University Science & Technology","Boakye, EA (corresponding author), Univ Quebec Montreal, Fac Sci, Montreal Quebec, Montreal, PQ H2X 3Y7, Canada.","eaaboakye@yahoo.com; aceesay@wetlands-africa.org; isiosemwegie@gmail.com; kapoury2012@gmail.com; hounkpeviachille@gmail.com; isak82.matchi2@yahoo.fr; buawolor2000@yahoo.com","","","","","",NA,"51","1","1","1","1","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0015-752X","1464-3626","","FORESTRY","Forestry","",NA,NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"","","","10.1093/forestry/cpac057","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/forestry/cpac057","","DEC 2022","10","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","7K4HZ",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000905246900001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Burana Jade and their sensitivities to different growth irradiances were studied in shade-grown plants over a period of 4 weeks. Maximal photosynthetic 02 evolution rates and CAM acidities [dawn/dusk fluctuations in titratable acidity] were higher in leaves exposed to intermediate sunlight [a maximal photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 500-600 mu mol m(-2) sl than in leaves grown under full sunlight (a maximal PPFD of 1 000-1 200 pmol m(-2) s(-1)) and shade (a maximal PPFD of 200-250 pmol m(-2) 2 s(-1)). However, these two parameters of GFP were highest in plants grown under the shade and lowest in full sun-grown plants. Both GL and GFP of plants exposed to full sunlight had lower predawn F-v/F-m [dark adapted ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence (the maximal photosystem 2 yield without actinic irradiation)] than those of shade-grown plants. When exposed to intermediate sunlight, however, there were no significant changes in predawn F-v/F-m in GL whereas a significant decrease in predawn F-v/F-m was found in GFP of the same plant. GFP exposed to full sunlight exhibited a greater decrease in predawn F-v/F-m compared to those exposed to intermediate sunlight. The patterns of changes in total chlorophyll (Chi) content of GL and GFP were similar to those of F-v/F-m. Although midday F-v/F-m fluctuated with prevailing irradiance, changes of midday F,/Fm after exposure to different growth irradiances were similar to those of predawn F-v/F-m in both GL and GFP. The decreases in predawn and midday F-v/F-m were much more pronounced in GFP than in GL under full sunlight, indicating greater sensitivity in GFP to high irradiance (HI). In the laboratory, electron transport rate and photochemical and non-photochemical quenching of Chi fluorescence were also determined under different irradiances. All results indicated that GFP are more susceptible to HI than GL. Although the GFP of Dendrobium cv.

Toyonoka) at different levels of nitrogen and also tested the combined effects of CO2, temperature and nitrogen on fruit quality of plants cultivated in controlled growth chambers. Results show that elevated CO2 and high temperature caused a further 12% and 35% decrease in fruit yield at low and high nitrogen, respectively. The fewer inflorescences and smaller umbel size during flower induction caused the reduction of fruit yield at elevated CO2 and high temperature. Interestingly, nitrogen application has no beneficial effect on fruit yield, and this may be because of decreased sucrose export to the shoot apical meristem at floral transition. Moreover, elevated CO2 increased the levels of dry matter-content, fructose, glucose, total sugar and sweetness index per dry matter, but decreased fruit nitrogen content, total antioxidant capacity and all antioxidant compounds per dry matter in strawberry fruit. The reduction of fruit nitrogen content and antioxidant activity was mainly caused by the dilution effect of accumulated non-structural carbohydrates sourced from the increased net photosynthetic rate at elevated CO2. Thus, the quality of strawberry fruit would increase because of the increased sweetness and the similar amount of fruit nitrogen content, antioxidant activity per fresh matter at elevated CO2. Overall, we found that elevated CO2 improved the production of strawberry (including yield and quality) at low temperature, but decreased it at high temperature. The dramatic fluctuation in strawberry yield between low and high temperature at elevated CO2 implies that more attention should be paid to the process of flower induction under climate change, especially in fruits that require winter chilling for reproductive growth.","[Sun, Peng; Lou, Heqiang; Hu, Ya; Sun, Dan; Zhu, Yueqing; Dong, Tingting; Lu, Hongfei] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, Jinhua, Peoples R China; [Mantri, Nitin] RMIT Univ, Hlth Innovat Res Inst, Sch Appl Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Zhejiang Normal University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)","Sun, P (corresponding author), Zhejiang Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Life Sci, Jinhua, Peoples R China.","luhongfei63@yahoo.com.cn","Lu, Hongfei/F-9526-2013","Lu, Hongfei/0000-0001-9732-0833; Mantri, Nitin/0000-0002-7621-035X; Lan, Ruiting/0000-0001-9834-5258","Project of Scientific and Technological Research Plan of Jinhua [2010-3-078, 2010-3-079]","Project of Scientific and Technological Research Plan of Jinhua","This research was funded by the Project of Scientific and Technological Research Plan of Jinhua (2010-3-078, 2010-3-079).

Few studies have addressed long-term changes in the net primary productivity (NPP) of mangroves in relation to the tropical monsoon climate. We conducted a tree census from 2008 to 2018 in a permanent plot at a secondary mangrove forest under the tropical monsoon climate of Eastern Thailand. During this period, the mortality of fast-growing species and the increasing number of newly recruited trees revealed a temporal change in the plant composition and distribution. Total tree biomass linearly increased from 283.64 to 381.72 t center dot ha(-1) during the study period. The NPP was calculated by using the summation method, which included fine root production. The NPP ranged from 21.19 to 29.04 t center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1). The fluctuation in NPP and its components were analyzed in relation to climatic factors by the linear regression model. The NPP did not relate with the annual climatic factors, such as the mean temperature and annual rainfall. However, both increments in the basal area and living tree biomass, which is a major component of NPP, were negatively related with the maximum and mean monthly temperatures in the dry season. The annual mortality rate related positively with annual rainfall and the maximum monthly temperature in the dry season. Linear regression analyses showed that some major components of NPP were chiefly affected by the temperature environment in the dry season. These results indicated that the weather in the dry season was largely restricting the mangrove NPP due to effects on the saline water dynamics of the soils under the tropical monsoon climate, which were revealed by our recent study. It implies that the hot-dry season may lead to high mortality, long-term reduction in the increment of living-trees biomass, and thus lowered the ability to maintain high NPP of mangrove forests over the long-term.","[Poungparn, Sasitorn; Rodtassana, Chadtip] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Komiyama, Akira; Kato, Shogo] Gifu Univ, Fac Appl Biol Sci, Lab Forest Ecol, Gifu 5011193, Japan; [Umnouysin, Suthathip] Silpakorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Muang 73000, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Sangtiean, Tanuwong; Maknual, Chatree; Pravinvongvuthi, Tamanai] Dept Marine & Coastal Resources, Off Mangrove Conservat, Bangkok 10210, Thailand; [Suchewaboripont, Vilanee] Inst Promot Teaching & Technol, Bangkok 10110, Thailand","Chulalongkorn University; Gifu University; Silpakorn University","Poungparn, S (corresponding author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.","sasitorn.p@chula.ac.th; komiyama@gifu-u.ac.jp; umnouysin_s@su.ac.th; chadtip.r@chula.ac.th; tanuwong@yahoo.com; c_maknual@hotmail.com; tamaguide@gmail.com; vilanee.s@hotmail.com; shogo@gifu-u.ac.jp","Poungparn, Sasitorn/ABA-3729-2021","Rodtassana, Chadtip/0000-0001-6388-0613; Suchewaboripont, Vilanee/0000-0001-8327-2949; , Sasitorn/0000-0002-5116-6954","Thailand Research Fund [RSA5680017, RSA6280070]; JSPS KAKENHI of Japan [16H05788]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16H05788] Funding Source: KAKEN","Thailand Research Fund(Thailand Research Fund (TRF)); JSPS KAKENHI of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The research was funded by the Thailand Research Fund (No. RSA5680017 and RSA6280070) and JSPS KAKENHI of Japan (No.16H05788).",NA,"65","8","8","4","18","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1999-4907","","FORESTS","Forests","SEP","2020","11","9","",NA,"",NA,"","","987","10.3390/f11090987","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f11090987","","","17","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","OF8HW",NA,"gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000581442400001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We identified genets by a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method and used their size and spatial pattern, together with demographic parameters (genet spreading rate and mortality rate of shoots) determined in the field to estimate natality rates for Festuca rubra (red fescue). 2 In each of two sites (a species-rich and a species-poor site in a mountain grassland) three plots were established. Each plot contained two 1 m x 3.3 cm transects, composed of 3.3 x 3.3 cm square cells. Estimates of genet number per plot (18-49 and 27-33, respectively, in the two sites) were based on a randomization test. Mean genet size (1.2-1.6 cells) was not significantly different between the sites, nor was the spatial pattern of genets significantly different from random at either site. Interactions between genets therefore appeared to be negligible. 3 A spatial simulation model was developed for the genet population. Values estimated from the growth and demographic data over several years for the genet spreading rate (0.2-0.3) and for the mortality rate of shoots per cell (0.2-0.3) were among those used in the simulation. When a constant genet natality rate of 3-7 genets m(-2) year(-1) was included in the model, the simulation generated numbers and size frequency distributions of genets that were similar to those found in the field. 4 In this mountain grassland, F. rubra appeared to show repeated seedling recruitment, instead of the initial seedling recruitment following disturbance that is thought to be typical of many grasses. Founder effects were immaterial at the rates of seedling recruitment apparent in these populations. A stable population was achieved with the values of genet spreading rate and mortality rate of shoots per cell observed in the field, and repeated seedling recruitment. However, genet natality rates may vary if environmental conditions fluctuate.","Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan; Acad Sci Czech Republ, Inst Bot, CS-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic","Hokkaido University; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences","Suzuki, JI (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600819, Japan.","","Herben, Tomas/G-1804-2014; /H-1601-2014; Hara, Toshihiko/D-8016-2012","Herben, Tomas/0000-0002-6636-0012; /0000-0001-7706-1723; ","","","",NA,"44","25","27","0","18","BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND","0022-0477","","","J ECOL","J.

Splicing of pre-mRNA is a crucial posttranscriptional regulatory step in gene expression in plants and is sensitive to temperature. DEAD-box RNA helicases belong to an RNA helicase family involved in the rearrangement of ribonucleoprotein complexes and the modification of RNA structure and are therefore involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism. In this study, we demonstrate that the rate of pre-mRNA splicing is reduced in rice at low temperatures and that the DEAD-box RNA Helicase42 (OsRH42) is necessary to support effective splicing of pre-mRNA during mRNA maturation at low temperatures. OsRH42 expression is tightly coupled to temperature fluctuation, and OsRH42 is localized in the splicing speckles and interacts directly with U2 small nuclear RNA. Retarded pre-mRNA splicing and plant growth defects were exhibited by OsRH42-knockdown transgenic lines at low temperatures, thus indicating that OsRH42 performs an essential role in ensuring accurate pre-mRNA splicing and normal plant growth under low ambient temperature. Unexpectedly, our results show that OsRH42 overexpression significantly disrupts the pre-mRNA splicing pathway, causing retarded plant growth and reducing plant cold tolerance. Combined, these results indicate that accurate control of OsRH42 homeostasis is essential for rice plants to respond to changes in ambient temperature. In addition, our study presents the molecular mechanism of DEAD-box RNA helicase function in pre-mRNA splicing, which is required for adaptation to cold stress in rice.","[Lu, Chung-An; Huang, Chun-Kai; Huang, Wen-Shan; Huang, Tian-Sheng; Liu, Hsin-Yi; Chen, Yu-Fu] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Life Sci, Jhongli 320, Taoyuan County, Taiwan","National Central University","Lu, CA (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Life Sci, Jhongli 320, Taoyuan County, Taiwan.","chungan@cc.ncu.edu.tw","","Lu, Chung-An/0000-0002-1206-1738; Huang, Chun-Kai/0000-0001-7325-1255","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST) [106-2311-B-008-001-MY3, 106-2313-B-008-001-MY3]","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST)(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported by grants 106-2311-B-008-001-MY3 and 106-2313-B-008-001-MY3 from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST).",NA,"102","22","25","3","29","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","0032-0889","1532-2548","","PLANT PHYSIOL","Plant Physiol.","JAN","2020","182","1","",NA,"",NA,"255","271","","10.1104/pp.19.00832","http://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.00832","","","17","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","KF0UU","31753844","Green Published","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000508968100021","View Full Record in Web of Science"

At present, the tree is inability to adapt to the environment, due to the environmental changes in this region, and the transpiration and water consumption of P. bolleana changcs accordingly, these phenomena lead to the growth of P. bolleana declines and even death occur frequently. To date, knowledge about the dynamics of transpiration of P. bolleana in the eastern Liaoning Province of North China is quite limited. Thus, better understanding its physical response to environmental factors and exploring the mechanisms of forest transpiration can offer a theoretical basis for a reasonable tree-planting program in semi-arid regions. In the present study, a continuous sap flow observation of P. bolleana in eastern Liaoning Province was carried out by using the thermal dissipation sap flow probe (TDP) from May to October (the whole growing season) in 2018, and the microclimate in the forest was recorded simultaneously, then the dynamics of sap flow and its respond to the variation change of environmental factors were studied. The results indicated that the sap flow changes of P. bolleana were shown as the characteristics of seasonal transition, consistent with the changes of environmental factors, at the beginning of the growing season, sap flow of P. bolleana was substantial, the efficiency of water usage was low. Till the middle of the growing season, nocturnal sap flow rate was increasing, daytime sap flow was decreasing. The starting time of sap flow became late, transpiration rate rise slowly, and peak of sap flow was narrow, and duration time was shorter till the late of the growing season. The water consumption of P. bolleana fluctuated slightly between months. The nocturnal sap flow had a good continuity, it was accounting for about 7% of the total daily water consumption. The sap flow was greatly affected by environmental factors, among which, the air temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetic effective radiation (PAR), potential reference evapotranspiration (ET0), and soil volume water content showed a significant positive correlation relationship, while there was a negative correlation with relative humidity and average wind velocity, but the correlation was not strong. Considering the autocorrelation of environmental variables, the optimal model was formulated, the main influencing variables were air temperature, VPD, PAR, and ET0 in the growing season under fitting analysis and stepwise regression analysis.","[Shi, Xiaoliang] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Shenyang 110866, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Bao, Yanfeng] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Desertificat Studies, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Hou Ruiping] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm China, Acad Forest Inventory & Planning, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tielong] Chinese Acad Inspect & Quarantine, Beijing 100176, Peoples R China","Shenyang Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Forestry; Institute of Desertification Studies, CAF; Chinese Academy of Inspection & Quarantine","Bao, YF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Desertificat Studies, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.","baoyanfeng@caf.ac.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of Chi-na [31600581, IDS2020JY-1]; Social Science Planning Fund Project of Liaoning Province [L17CGL008]; Scientific Research Funding Project of the Education Department of Liaoning Province [WSNJC202035]; introductory Talent Research Start Project of Shenyang Agricultural University under Grant 2016; Fund for Postdoctoral Research of Shenyang Agricultural University [770218007]; Key Research and Development projects of the Hebei Province Study on the browning control method in the thermal processing of flexible pouch chestnut [20327113D]","National Natural Science Foundation of Chi-na(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Planning Fund Project of Liaoning Province; Scientific Research Funding Project of the Education Department of Liaoning Province; introductory Talent Research Start Project of Shenyang Agricultural University under Grant 2016; Fund for Postdoctoral Research of Shenyang Agricultural University; Key Research and Development projects of the Hebei Province Study on the browning control method in the thermal processing of flexible pouch chestnut","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of Chi-na31600581, Funding Balance ProjectIDS2020JY-1, the Social Science Planning Fund Project of Liaoning Province [grant number L17CGL008], the Scientific Research Funding Project of the Education Department of Liaoning Province [grant number WSNJC202035], in part by the Key Research and Development projects of the Hebei Province Study on the browning control method in the thermal processing of flexible pouch chestnut [grant number 20327113D], in part by the introductory Talent Research Start Project of Shenyang Agricultural University under Grant 2016, in part by the Fund for Postdoctoral Research of Shenyang Agricultural University under Grant 770218007.",NA,"32","0","0","2","2","PARLAR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS (P S P)","FREISING","ANGERSTR. 12, 85354 FREISING, GERMANY","1018-4619","1610-2304","","FRESEN ENVIRON BULL","Fresenius Environ.

The genus Symbiodinium contains nine clades, some of which behave differently in response to strong light and/or temperature stresses, for example, clade D Symbiodinium are thermally tolerant. However, previous studies are based on corals present in the field, and it is possible that the corals used in previous experiments did not contain single Symbiodinium clades. For an accurate assessment of the effects of each Symbiodinium clade on host thermal stress resistance, monoclonal cultures of clades C1 and D were inoculated into aposymbiotic juvenile polyps. Photosynthetic efficiency (maximum quantum yield: F-v/F-m) showed a decline at 30 degrees C than at 25 degrees C in both clades. Symbiodinium clade C1 showed a consistently higher rETRmax with larger fluctuations than clade D, with a lower survival rate of juveniles during thermal stress treatment. Under strong light exposure, corals containing clade C1 showed a greater decline in F-v/F-m (-74%), compared to decline in corals associated with clade D (-50%) after 3 hours. This is the first study to assess stress tolerances of juvenile corals in association with the monoclonal Symbiodinium clades C and D, and our results indicated greater tolerance of corals associated with clade D to strong light (500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). However, it is difficult to determine the impact of high-temperature stress on coral-algae symbiosis from photosynthetic activity. At high temperatures, clade C1 Symbiodinium exhibited high photosynthetic activity, but host survival rates were higher in corals associated with clade D Symbiodinium. Since clade C1 has a relatively high photosynthetic activity under high temperatures, clade C1 symbiosis at high temperatures might have a negative impact on corals compared with clade D.","[Yuyama, Ikuko] Natl Inst Genet, Ctr Informat Biol, 1111 Yata, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan; [Nakamura, Takashi; Hidaka, Michio] Univ Ryukyus, Dept Chem Biol & Marine Sicence, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Nakamura, Takashi] JICA JST SATREPS, Tokyo, Japan; [Higuchi, Tomihiko] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan","Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); National Institute of Genetics (NIG) - Japan; University of the Ryukyus; University of Tokyo","Yuyama, I (corresponding author), Natl Inst Genet, Ctr Informat Biol, 1111 Yata, Mishima, Shizuoka 4118540, Japan.","ikuko_yy@hotmail.com; takasuke@sci.u-ryukyu.ac.jp; thiguchi@aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp; hidaka@sci.u-ryukyu.ac.jp","Higuchi, Tomihiko/AAW-6006-2020; Higuchi, Tomihiko/D-7118-2019","Higuchi, Tomihiko/0000-0001-7324-5752; Higuchi, Tomihiko/0000-0001-7324-5752","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan [20121001]; Japan Society for the promotion of Science [26-40135]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K18744, 14J40135, 26870246] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Japan Society for the promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to Mr. Kenji Iwao (the Akajima Marine Science Laboratory) and Dr. Saki Harii (The university of Rryukyu) for provision of Acropora tenuis larvae.

In this study, we describe I) interactions between soil CO2 concentration, temperature, soil water content and root respiration, and II) the effect of short-term fluctuations of these three environmental factors on the relation between actual and observed root respiration rates. We designed an automated, open gas-exchange system that allows continuous measurements on 12 chambers with intact roots in soil. By using three distinct chamber designs with each a different path for the air flow, we were able to measure root respiration over a 50-fold range of soil CO2 concentrations (400 to 25000 ppm) and to separate the effect of irrigation on observed vs. actual root respiration rate. All respiration measurements were made on one-year-old citrus seedlings in sterilized sandy soil with minimal organic material. Root respiration was strongly affected by diurnal fluctuations in temperature (Q(10) = 2), which agrees well with the literature. In contrast to earlier findings for Douglas-fir (Qi et al., 1994), root respiration rates of citrus were not affected by soil CO2 concentrations (400 to 25000 ppm CO2; pH around 6). Soil CO2 was strongly affected by soil water content but not by respiration measurements, unless the air flow for root respiration measurements was directed through the soil. The latter method of measuring root respiration reduced soil CO2 concentration to that of incoming air. Irrigation caused a temporary reduction in CO2 diffusion, decreasing the observed respiration rates obtained by techniques that depended on diffusion. This apparent drop in respiration rate did not occur if the air flow was directed through the soil. Our dynamic data are used to indicate the optimal method of measuring root respiration in soil, in relation to the objectives and limitations of the experimental conditions.","PENN STATE UNIV,DEPT HORT,UNIVERSITY PK,PA 16802","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park","","","Eissenstat, David/AAE-2793-2020; Bouma, Tjeerd J/A-9841-2011","","","","",NA,"36","114","139","6","80","KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL","DORDRECHT","SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0032-079X","","","PLANT SOIL","Plant Soil","AUG","1997","195","2","",NA,"",NA,"221","232","","10.1023/A:1004278421334","http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004278421334","","","12","Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Soil Science","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture; Plant Sciences","YE364",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1997YE36400002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

An extension was added to the model to predict E. coli O157:H7 growth due to temperature abuses in a cold storage facility. A user-friendly interface was created to follow variations in model outputs. The number of contaminated bags and lettuce contamination levels were computed and visualized. Experimental data of cross-contamination from literature was used to describe the facility and validate the model. The key factor affecting cross-contamination in the process is the free chlorine (FC) concentration dose rate. The number of contaminated bags per batch decreases nonlinearly as FC is added to the flume tank. The contamination level in the shredded lettuces increases linearly with initial microbial load or the initial contamination probability on lettuce heads. Both the level and probability of contamination in the facility's environment alter the number of contaminated bags. Batch size influences the number of contaminated bags when the first incoming lettuce batch is contaminated. The smaller the batch size the smaller number of contaminated bags. Storage room temperature fluctuations (13 and 19 degrees C and 8 and 12 degrees C) show the importance of real-time monitoring to avoid pathogen growth and number of contaminated bags. This work provides insight on applications of agent-based modeling approach using NetLogo to visualize cross-contamination in fresh-cut leafy green processing operations. It analyzes cross-contamination and its impact on processing performance by studying the effect of mitigation strategies. Practical applications To support ready-to-eat leafy greens postharvest operations, this work investigated the benefits of using visualization to develop strategies to prevent produce cross-contamination along processing and the effect of temperature abuse during storage. Output from the model can be used in Quantitative Management Risk Assessment (QMRA) applications. By developing a simulation-based decision support system, the safety of processing and storage steps of fresh-cut leafy greens are investigated. Pathogen cross-contamination and growth models are integrated to observe impacts of varying contamination levels in incoming produce and equipment surfaces, concentrations of free chlorine in the wash water, and storage temperatures on the number of contamination bags over time. Computational experiments study a pilot plant of Romaine lettuces contaminated with E. coli O157:H7. Results indicate that the key factor affecting cross-contamination is the chlorination concentration dose rate in the wash water.

Water use efficiencies related to the amount of rainfall during the growing seasons were calculated for seeds and total above ground biomass. The soil deformation levels (main plots) comprised the following trials: non-compacted (NC, 0 tractor pass), moderately compacted (MC, 3 passes), and strongly compacted (SC, 5 passes). A uniform seedbed in all plots was prepared by harrowing before planting. The main plots included sub-plots without and with surface wheat straw mulch (0.5 kg m(-2)) and the corresponding trials were NC + M, MC + M, SC + M. The amount and distribution of rainfall during the growing season differed among the experimental years with extended drought at bloom-full seed (R2-R6) stages in 2006, good water supply in 2007, and alternative periods with relatively high and low rainfalls in 2008. The effect of soil deformation on matric potential was influenced by weather conditions, soybean growth phase, mulching and depth. The differences were greatest in 2007 and 2008 at R7-R8 growth stages. With increasing deformation level from NC to SC matric potential for 0-15 cm depth during these stages significantly decreased from -401 to -1184 kPa in 2007 and from -1154 to -1432 kPa in 2008. On mulched soil, the corresponding ranges were from -541 to -841 klpa and from -748 to -1386 kPa, respectively. In the dry summer 2006, the differences were smaller and less consistent. Irrespective of soil deformation level, mulching reduced soil temperature in most growth phases but most pronounced initially. Most yield components increased from NC to MC during the experiments which could be attributed to enhanced root water and nutrient uptake rates and decreased from MC to SC due to high soil strength that restrained root growth down to deeper depth. The yields of seeds, straw, protein and oil as well as water productivity of soybean seed and biomass were improved by mulching in 2007-2008. This improvement was more pronounced in 2007 when the mean yield of seeds, protein and oil were significantly greater by 16, 29 and 11%, respectively and was attributed to positive alterations in soil water retention. These results indicate the possibilities of improvement in soybean performance by identifying allowable amount of traffic and mulching practices at planting depending on weather fluctuations during the growing season. Since rainfall and air temperature distribution in 2007 are close to those averaged over a long period of time, the use of straw mulch may positively affect soybean performance and yields excluding anomalously dry years. The positive effect of straw mulch can be enhanced by moderate soil deformation combined with seedbed loosening before planting to avoid constraining effect of soil structure on crop establishment.

In a mesocosm experiment, we aimed at disentangling the molecular response of P, oceanica under increasing temperature (20 degrees C-32 degrees C). The experiment was carried out in spring, when heat waves can potentially occur and plants are putatively more sensitive to heat stress, since they are deprived in carbohydrates reserves after the cold winter months. We aimed to identify the activation of different phases of the cellular stress response (CSR) reaction and the responsive genes activated or repressed in heated plants. A molecular traffic light was proposed as a response model including green (protein folding and membrane protection), yellow (ubiquitination and proteolysis) and red (DNA repair and apoptosis) categories. Additionally, we estimated phenological trait variations to complement the information obtained from the molecular proxies of stress. Despite reduced leaf growth rate, heated plants did not exhibit signs of irreversible damage, probably underlying species pre-adaptation to warm and fluctuating regimes. Gene expression analyses revealed that molecular chaperoning, DNA repair and apoptosis inhibition processes related genes were the ones that mostly responded to high thermal stress and will be target of further investigation and in situ proofing for assessing their use as indicators of P. oceanica performance under sub-lethal heat stress.","[Traboni, Claudia; Mammola, Salvatore Davide; Ruocco, Miriam; Procaccini, Gabriele; Marin-Guirao, Lazaro] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Integrat Marine Ecol, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Mammola, Salvatore Davide] Univ Politecn Marche, Piazza Roma 22, I-60121 Ancona, Italy; [Ontoria, Yaiza] Univ Barcelona, Dept Evolutionary Biol Ecol & Ciencies Ambientals, Av Diagonal 643, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Ruiz, Juan M.] Spanish Inst Oceanog, Oceanog Ctr Murcia, Seagrass Ecol Grp, Murcia 30740, Spain","Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn di Napoli; Marche Polytechnic University; University of Barcelona; Spanish Institute of Oceanography","Procaccini, G (corresponding author), Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Integrat Marine Ecol, I-80121 Naples, Italy.","gpro@szn.it","Procaccini, Gabriele/A-6618-2010; Ruocco, Miriam/AAD-4524-2019; Ontoria, Yaiza/AAA-9113-2021; Traboni, Claudia/O-6684-2018; Procaccini, Gabriele/AAA-7040-2019; MarÃn-Guirao, LÃzaro/A-3481-2013","Procaccini, Gabriele/0000-0002-6179-468X; Ruocco, Miriam/0000-0002-3779-8373; Traboni, Claudia/0000-0003-0380-2888; Procaccini, Gabriele/0000-0002-6179-468X; MarÃn-Guirao, LÃzaro/0000-0001-6240-8018; RUIZ FERNANDEZ, JUAN MANUEL/0000-0002-5974-1407","Spanish project RECCAM - National Plan of Research of the Spanish Government [CTM2013-48027-C3-2-R]; SZN PhD fellowship via Open University","Spanish project RECCAM - National Plan of Research of the Spanish Government; SZN PhD fellowship via Open University","This study has been supported by the Spanish project RECCAM (Seagrass Meadows resilience to global warming: an analysis based on responses at ecophysiological, population and ecosystem levels; project CTM2013-48027-C3-2-R) funded by the National Plan of Research of the Spanish Government.

Our main result gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a positive periodic solution (i.e. a periodic solution characterized by the presence of microalgae) which is globally attractive. In our approach, we reduce the model to a cooperative planar periodic system. Using results on periodic Kolmogorov equations and on monotone sub-homogeneous dynamical systems, we describe the global dynamics of the reduced system. Then, using the theory of asymptotically periodic semiflows, we extend the results on the reduced system to the original model.

At 5 degrees C ants of both species from southern latitudes were metabolically more active than those from more northerly latitudes, whereas at 25 degrees C the situation was reversed. Estimates of Q10 were positively correlated with latitude indicating that the respiratory metabolism of northern populations increases relatively more in response to rising temperatures than southern populations.

A study was conducted to develop a field screening method for cold tolerance by recreating seedbed conditions limiting seed growth and quantifying the effect of those limiting parameters on the germination and emergence of two maize hybrids. By comparing maize germination and emergence in uncovered control plots with those covered with reflective insulation, differences were monitored in soil temperature, soil water content, oxygen and air content. Maize germination and emergence were monitored, and rate of radicle and coleoptile growth was measured. Soil temperature was significantly reduced by covering with reflective insulation. The average soil temperature at 5 cm depth was 5.5 and 7.4 degrees C in late April, 11.0 and 16.0 degrees C in May and 14.0 and 16.6 degrees C in early June for the covered and uncovered treatments, respectively. In addition, day-to-day fluctuation in maximum and minimum temperatures was much smaller under covered than uncovered conditions. Although air content was maintained (about 34% on average), seedbed oxygen content dropped tremendously three times during the growing period. Reflective insulation cover caused a 5-d delay in germination and emergence for both hybrids. On average, across hybrids, the daily growth rate of radicle and coleoptile was 50% and 22% higher in uncovered than in covered treatments. Reflective insulation cover created adverse growth conditions and reduced seed germination, which suggests that it could be used to create uniform cold seedbed conditions for screening maize cold tolerant lines under field conditions.","Agr & Agri Food Canada, ECORC, Cent Expt Farm, Res Branch, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Agriculture & Agri Food Canada","Ma, BL (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, ECORC, Cent Expt Farm, Res Branch, Ottawa, ON, Canada.","mab@agr.gc.ca","","","","","",NA,"17","4","5","0","5","CANADIAN SCIENCE PUBLISHING, NRC RESEARCH PRESS","OTTAWA","65 AURIGA DR, SUITE 203, OTTAWA, ON K2E 7W6, CANADA","0008-4220","1918-1833","","CAN J PLANT SCI","Can.

We analyzed a historical simulation (1965-2000) from an end-to-end ecosystem model of anchovy population dynamics for the California Current System to untangle the effects of warm versus cool conditions on recruitment. A 3-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic-NPZD (nitrogen-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus) model (ROMS-NEMURO) provided the physical conditions (circulation, temperature) and 3 zooplankton concentrations as inputs to an anchovy full life cycle individual-based model (IBM). Our analysis was focused on isolating the effects of the well-documented El Nino Southern Oscillation signal and 3 climate regimes on spawning habitat, development, and survival of eggs and yolk-sac larvae, growth and survival of larvae and juveniles, and ultimately recruitment of anchovy. The major drivers of lowered recruitment success in warm years and in warmer regimes were reduced survival and growth rates of eggs and larvae that resulted from the poleward shift of adults in response to warmer temperatures prior to spawning. Three model-data comparisons showed the model deviated from empirically derived values of annual recruitment success but agreed with data for annual mean latitude of egg distributions and predicted larval consumption rates versus measured zooplankton concentrations. More effort is needed to improve certain biological aspects of the IBM so that it can replicate empirically estimated recruitment fluctuations. Overall, the altered responses of anchovy to changing climate in the California Current domain illustrate the benefit of the present mechanistic approach to infer how anchovy may respond under future ecosystem conditions.","[Politikos, D., V; Curchitser, E.

However, as the start of the growing season often varies substantially across years, adaptive parental effects on juvenile developmental rates may mediate the costs of a delayed season. By employing a meta-analysis, we tested whether larval developmental rates across a latitudinal cline of the common frog (Rana temporaria) are affected by fluctuating onsets of breeding, across years. We predicted that larval developmental rate will be inversely related to the onset of breeding, and that northern populations will be more prone to shorten their developmental rate in response to late breeding, as the costs of delayed metamorphosis should be highest in areas with a shorter growing season. We found that the larval period of both northern and southern populations responded to parental environmental conditions to a similar degree in absolute terms, but in different directions. In northern populations, a late season start correlated with decreased development time, suggesting that the evolution of parental effects aids population persistence in time-constrained environments. In southern populations, late season start correlated with increased development time, which could potentially be explained as a predator avoidance strategy. Our findings suggest that local ecological variables can induce adaptive parental effects, but responses are complex, and likely trade-off with other ecological factors.","[Rowinski, Piotr K.; Gotthard, Karl; Sowersby, Will; Eckerstrom-Liedholm, Simon; Bogen, Bjorn] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Laurila, Anssi; Lind, Martin, I; Richter-Boix, Alex] Uppsala Univ, Dept Ecol & Genet, Anim Ecol, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Bogen, Bjorn] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Freshwater Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-17893 Drottningholm, Sweden","Stockholm University; Uppsala University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences","Rowinski, PK; Bogen, B (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Bogen, B (corresponding author), Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Inst Freshwater Res, Dept Aquat Resources, S-17893 Drottningholm, Sweden.","Piotr.Rowinski@zoologi.su.se; Bjorn.Rogell@slu.se","Richter-Boix, Alex/E-3990-2012","Richter-Boix, Alex/0000-0002-8559-5191; Eckerstrom-Liedholm, Simon/0000-0002-3705-1907; Sowersby, Will/0000-0002-9774-5935; Lind, Martin/0000-0001-5602-1933; Rowinski, Piotr/0000-0002-7247-3742","Stockholm University; Swedish Research Council","Stockholm University; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council)","Open access funding provided by Stockholm University.

Three strains of microalgae were screened and the biomass of microalgae could be optimized 0.313-0.790 g L-1 in 10 L bioreactor. The determination results of bioactive substances in these three microalgae showed that, the amount of fucoxanthin in the growth phase II (14 days) was maximum, at 5.354, 6.284 and 14.837 mg g-1 respectively. The diatoxanthin of Dut-wj-J1 in growth phase III (21 days) could reach 5.158 mg g-1. Dut-wj-J4 had the highest lipid pro-duction efficiency (9.45 mg L-1 d-1) followed by Dut-wj-J2 (8.49 mg L-1 d-1) and Dut-wj-J1 (8.18 mg L-1 d-1) re-spectively. These bioactive substances have inhibition zones of 7-13 mm against all four strains of bacteria ie., Acetobacter, Rhodococcus erythropolis, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis Cohn respectively. In addition, these microalgae can play a potential role in nutrient enrichment in eutrophic seawater. The NO3- degradation rates of these three algae in the first 14 days were 75.0 %, 45.8 % and 100 % respectively, as well as the PO4- degradation rates in the first 7 days were 94.8 %, 100 % and 80.9 % respectively. This work manifests the plasticity of algae isolated from the Bohai Sea and provides useful insights for further joint production of bioactive substances.","[Jing, Wang; Qu, Yihe; Shan, Jiajia; Russel, Mohammad; Wenchao, Wu; Zhang, Dayong] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Ocean Sci & Technol, Key Lab Ind Ecol & Environm Engn, Minist Educ, Panjin 124221, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Alam, Md.

The tree was placed in a growth chamber in which daily patterns of temperature and radiation were constant. The effects of drought on the water and carbon status of the stem were examined by measuring stem sap flow rate, stem water potential, stem diameter variations, stem CO2 efflux rate (F-CO2) and xylem CO2 concentration ([CO*(2)]). Before and after the drought treatment, diurnal fluctuations in Fco, and [CO*(2)] corresponded well with variations in stem temperature (T,,,). Daytime depressions in F-CO2 did not occur. During the drought treatment, F-CO2 still responded to stepwise changes in temperature, but diurnal fluctuations in F-CO2 were no longer correlated with diurnal fluctuations in T, From the moment daily growth rate of the stem became zero, diurnal fluctuations in F-CO2 became closely correlated with diameter variations, exhibiting clear daytime depressions. The depressions in F-CO2 were likely the result of a reduction in metabolic activity caused by the lowered daytime stem water status. Xylem [CO*(2)] showed clear daytime depressions in response to drought. When the tree was re-watered, F-CO2 and [CO*(2)] exhibited sharp increases, coinciding with an increase in stem diameter.

To better understand the environmental drivers of salp blooms, we conducted 8 surveys to sample T. democratica in contrasting seasonal, temperature and chlorophyll conditions. In each survey, short-term variations in the abundances of different salp stages were assessed by sampling the same population at 30 min intervals. Using these data, we estimated the parameters in a set of stage-classified matrix population models representing different assumptions about the influence of temperature and chlorophyll on each stage. In the model that best explains our observations, only females are affected by changes in water temperature. Whether this is a direct influence of temperature or an indirect effect reflecting low food availability, female reproduction cessation seems to slow population growth under unfavourable conditions. When conditions become favourable again, females liberate the embryo and change sex to male, allowing for mating under extremely low salp densities and triggering the bloom. In contrast to previous findings, our results suggest that females, rather than oozooids, are responsible for the sustainability of salp populations during latency periods.","[Pascual, Maria; Dominguez-Carrio, Carlos; Salvador, Joaquin; Olariaga, Alejandro; Fuentes, Veronica] Inst Ciencias Mar, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Neubert, Michael G.; Solow, Andrew R.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Luis Acuna, Jose] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo 33003, Spain","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro Mediterraneo de Investigaciones Marinas y Ambientales (CMIMA); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias del Mar (ICM); Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University of Oviedo","Pascual, M (corresponding author), Inst Ciencias Mar, Barcelona 08003, Spain.","mpascual@icm.csic.es","Torner, Maria Pascual/AAD-4621-2021; Dominguez-Carrió, Carlos/K-5723-2017; Joaquin, Salvador/ABF-7075-2021; Fernández, José Luis Acuña/I-7482-2016","Torner, Maria Pascual/0000-0002-7483-9883; Dominguez-Carrió, Carlos/0000-0002-0025-9376; Fernández, José Luis Acuña/0000-0003-3306-7212; Neubert, Michael/0000-0001-8820-5008","US National Science Foundation [DEB-1145017, DEB-1257545]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1257545] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This work was founded by the Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion under the Fishjelly project, the European commission ENPI CBC MED project under the Jellyrisk project and the European LIFE Commission under the Cubomed project.

P. viridis is a remarkable species in terms of its ability to reach very high biomass levels, to withstand environmental fluctuations, to concentrate a variety of organic and inorganic environmental pollutants, to colonise artificial marine habitats and to invade new geographic territories. This review collates data available on salient aspects of the distribution, biology and ecology of P. viridis. It is argued that the remarkable success of P. viridis as an invasive species basically stems from its long larval duration, fast growth rate, high fecundity, early maturity, high productivity and ability to withstand fluctuating environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, water turbidity and pollutants). Relevant aspects of the data are compared with the data available for a similar species Perna perna, which too is an invasive species, but to a more limited extent.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Anim Ecol & Ecophysiol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands; BARC Facilities, Biofouling & Biofilm Proc Sect, Water & Steam Chem Div, Tamil Nadu, India; KEMA Power Generat & Sustainables, NL-6800 ET Arnhem, Netherlands","Radboud University Nijmegen; Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC)","Rajagopal, S (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Water & Wetland Res, Dept Anim Ecol & Ecophysiol, Toernooiveld 1, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands.","s.rajagopal@science.ru.nl","van der Velde, Gerard/C-7776-2011","","","","",NA,"150","102","105","5","34","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1386-2588","1573-5125","","AQUAT ECOL","Aquat.

Our objectives were to precisely determine the daily water use (DWU) of Hydrangea macrophylla and Gardenia jasminoides grown in 6-L containers, quantify how this is affected by environmental conditions, develop a quantitative model describing DWU, evaluate this model with an independent data set, and determine the feasibility of using crop coefficients (K-c) for irrigation scheduling. In 2010, we quantified the DWU of two Hydrangea macrophylla cultivars, Fasan and Pia. There was little difference in DWU of the two cultivars, which ranged from 50 to 300 mL/plant/day depending on plant age and environmental (hoophouse) conditions. In 2010, daily light integral (DLI) had the greatest influence on DWU with DWU increasing with increasing DLI. The combination of plant age, final leaf area, DLI, and their interactions explained 83.2% and 90.8% of day-to-day variation in DWU of 'Fasan' and 'Pia', respectively. In July 2011, a follow-up study was conducted using Hydrangea macrophylla 'Fasan' and Gardenia jasminoides 'Radicans'. DWU of 'Fasan' ranged from 50 to 200 mL/plant/day and DWU of 'Radicans' ranged from 50 to 560 mL/plant/day. The lower DWU of 'Fasan' in 2011 compared with 2010 was the result of stunted growth of the hydrangeas, a result of elevated temperatures within the hoophouse during the plants initial growth flush. Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) explained more of the daily fluctuations in DWU in 2011 compared with 2010. Predicting DWU of the 2011 'Fasan' crop using 2011 environmental conditions and the model developed using the 2010 data resulted in DWU estimates that were on average 64% too high. This discrepancy is likely the result of slower overall growth rate and a 15.4% reduction in 'Fasan' total growth in 2011 compared with 2010 and points to the challenges of modeling DWU.

This study aimed to assess the effect of seed priming on Camelina sativa L. under heat stress. Experimental treatments were comprised of; seed priming including, no-priming, hydropriming (distilled water priming), and osmopriming (thiourea applications at 500 ppm), heat stress (control = 20 degrees C and heat stress = 32 degrees C), and camelina varieties (7126 and 8046). Heat stress hammered crop growth as relative water content and photosynthetic rate were reduced by 35.9% and 49.05% in 7126, respectively, and 25.6% and 41.2% in 8046 as compared with control-no thiourea applied. However, osmopriming with thiourea improved the root and shoot length, and biomass production compared to control-no application under heat stress, with more improvement in variety 8046 as compared with 7126. Moreover, the maximum values of gas exchange and water relations were recorded at thiourea priming and no stress as compared with no-priming under heat stress that helped to improve seed yield by 12% in 7126 and 15% in 8046, respectively. Among the varieties, camelina variety 8046 showed better performance than 7126 by producing higher seed yield especially when subjected to thiourea priming. In conclusion, thiourea seed priming helped the plants to mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress by upregulating plant physiological attributes that lead to maintain camelina seed yield.","[Waraich, Ejaz Ahmad; Ahmad, Muhammad; Manzoor, Muhammad Taimoor] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Agron, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan; [Soufan, Walid] King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Plant Prod Dept, POB 2460, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Ahmad, Zahoor] Univ Cent Punjab, Dept Bot, Bahawalpur Campus, Bahawalpur 63100, Pakistan; [Habib-Ur-Rahman, Muhammad] Univ Bonn, Inst Crop Sci & Resource Conservat INRES, Crop Sci, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [El Sabagh, Ayman] Kafrelsheikh Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Kafrelsheikh 33516, Egypt","University of Agriculture Faisalabad; King Saud University; University of Bonn; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Kafrelsheikh University","Waraich, EA (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Agron, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan.;El Sabagh, A (corresponding author), Kafrelsheikh Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agron, Kafrelsheikh 33516, Egypt.","uaf_ewarraich@yahoo.com; ahmadbajwa516@gmail.com; wsoufan@ksu.edu.sa; taimoorpansota95@gmail.com; zahoorahmadbwp@gmail.com; mhabibur@uni-bonn.de; ayman.elsabagh@agr.kfs.edu.eg","Soufan, Walid/D-5293-2019; Ahmad, Muhammad/AAB-6963-2022; Rahman, Muhammad Habib ur/Y-8036-2019; Waraich, Ejaz Ahmad/AAE-8726-2021","Soufan, Walid/0000-0002-6273-2050; Ahmad, Muhammad/0000-0002-8276-034X; Rahman, Muhammad Habib ur/0000-0002-2823-9959; Waraich, Ejaz Ahmad/0000-0001-6167-9174","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2021/390]","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","This Research was funded by the Researchers Supporting Project number (RSP-2021/390), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",NA,"63","6","6","1","10","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2073-4395","","AGRONOMY-BASEL","Agronomy-Basel","SEP","2021","11","9","",NA,"",NA,"","","1875","10.3390/agronomy11091875","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11091875","","","14","Agronomy; Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture; Plant Sciences","UV3UF",NA,"gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000699407200001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

This study tested the hypothesis that the advantage to the featherless broiler condition with respect to breast meat yield and quality is due to differences in muscle development during pre- and posthatch periods. Broilers from the 3 genetic groups were reared under normal (26 degrees C) and hot (32 degrees C) conditions and slaughtered on d 29 and 47. Evaluation of myofiber diameter (mean and distribution) and blood-vessel density in breast muscle sections sampled on these days revealed that the fluctuations in breast muscle yields of the different genetic groups under different temperature conditions and the better muscle growth of the featherless broilers are due to changes in muscle hypertrophy and vascularization. In addition, the featherless broilers presented continuous satellite cell proliferation and a slower rate of differentiation compared with the feathered broilers on immediate posthatch period, suggesting a higher reserve of myogenic progeny cells that will contribute to later muscle hypertrophy. In the embryos, breast muscle yield was higher for the featherless versus feathered counterparts between embryonic day (E) 15 and E20. This was manifested in a shift toward higher myofiber diameters in the featherless embryos on E18, and a higher number of myoblasts, which could be explained by higher insulinlike growth factor-I levels in the muscle tissue and lower triiodothyronine levels in the plasma on E17. Together, the data show the advantage of being featherless under hot conditions with regard to breast muscle growth and hypertrophy, and overall performance. Moreover, featherless embryos had increased breast muscle weight compared with their feathered counterparts, likely due to a higher proliferation rate of myoblasts and higher muscle hypertrophy.","[Hadad, Yair; Halevy, Orna] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, Dept Anim Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel; [Hadad, Yair; Cahaner, Avigdor] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, Inst Plant Sci & Genet, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel","Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem","Halevy, O (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Robert H Smith Fac Agr Food & Environm, Dept Anim Sci, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel.","orna.halevy@mail.huji.ac.il","","Cahaner, Avigdor/0000-0002-8579-4326","United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development (BARD) fund [IS-4300-10]","United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development (BARD) fund","This study was supported in part by the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development (BARD) fund, grant no.

Uptake of CO2 and its storage in the aerenchyma tissues of Lycopsids and diurnal acidity fluctuation in aquatic plants during the Palaeozoic era (ca. 300 Ma.) would represent the earliest evolution of a CCM. The CCM parts of the dark reactions of photosynthesis have evolved many times, while the light reactions are conserved across plant lineages. A C-4 type CCM, leaf C-4 photosynthesis is evolved in the PACMAD clade of the Poaceae family. The evolution of C-4 photosynthesis from C-3 photosynthesis was an abaptation. Photosynthesis in reproductive tissues of sorghum and maize (PACMAD clade) has been shown to be of a weaker C-4 type (high CO2 compensation point, low carbon isotope discrimination, and lack of Rubisco compartmentalization, when compared to the normal C-4 types) than that in the leaves (normal C-4 type). However, this does not fit well with the character polarity concept from an evolutionary perspective. In a recent model proposed for CCM evolution, the development of a rudimentary CCM prior to the evolution of a more efficient CCM (features contrasting to a weaker C-4 type, leading to greater biomass production rate) has been suggested. An intermediate crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) type of CCM (rudimentary) was reported in the genera, Brassia, Coryanthes, Eriopsis, Peristeria, of the orchids (well-known group of plants that display the CAM pathway). Similarly, we propose here the evolution of a rudimentary CCM (C-4-like type pathway) in the non-foliar tissues of the Poaceae, prior to the evolution of the C-4 pathway as identified in the leaves of the C-4 species of the PACMAD clade.","[Rangan, Parimalan; Wankhede, Dhammaprakash P.; Subramani, Rajkumar; Malik, Surendra K.; Singh, Kuldeep] ICAR Natl Bur Plant Genet Resources, PUSA Campus, New Delhi 110012, India; [Chinnusamy, Viswanathan] ICAR Indian Agr Res Inst, PUSA Campus, New Delhi 110012, India; [Baig, Mirza Jaynul] ICAR Natl Rice Res Inst, Cuttack 753006, India; [Rangan, Parimalan; Henry, Robert] Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia","Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Bureau of Plant Genetics Resources; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Indian Agricultural Research Institute; Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - National Rice Research Institute; University of Queensland","Rangan, P (corresponding author), ICAR Natl Bur Plant Genet Resources, PUSA Campus, New Delhi 110012, India.;Rangan, P (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Queensland Alliance Agr & Food Innovat, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.","r.parimalan@icar.gov.in; d.wankhede@icar.gov.in; s.rajkumar@icar.gov.in; v.chinnusamy@icar.gov.in; Surendra.malik@icar.gov.in; mj.baig@icar.gov.in; Kuldeep.singh4@icar.gov.in; Robert.henry@uq.edu.au","Henry, Robert J/B-5824-2008; Chinnusamy, Viswanathan/B-9079-2009","Henry, Robert J/0000-0002-4060-0292; Rangan, Parimalan/0000-0003-1660-8072; Chinnusamy, Viswanathan/0000-0003-2174-9064","Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi [16113160001-1006976]","Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi(Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR))","The authors acknowledge the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi for the research grant 16113160001-1006976 under the 'Incentivizing research in Agriculture' scheme.

In this study, an oleaginous alga Scenedesmus obliquus that was isolated from the dairy wastewater was examined for its bioremediation of municipal wastewater. Water samples, including raw and treated ones, were collected from three wastewater treatment plants at different scales. Under indoor conditions, S. obliquus showed strong nutrient removal efficiency, with nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates being over 99%. The alga grew faster in the raw wastewater (specific growth rates: 0.37 - 0.45 d(-1)), whereas more lipids accumulated in the treated wastewater (31.45-35.74%of dry weight). The raw wastewater-based culture was subsequently enlarged by using panel photo-bioreactors (PBRs) in semi-continuous mode. Such outdoor cultivations were conducted twice in different seasons, reflecting the impacts of environmental fluctuation. Results showed that under the natural condition, the hydraulic retention time (HRT)based culture was significantly impacted by the changeable temperatures and illumination; instead, replacing the medium (i.e. raw wastewater) following biomass concentration rather than HRT made the culture system more stable. An average biomass productivity of 0.22 g L-1 d(-1) was obtained, regardless of the changing environmental conditions. These findings may advance the knowledge of employing S. obliquus for raw wastewater treatment at the industrial scale.","[Ling, Yun] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Ecol & Environm, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Sun, Li-ping; Wang, Shi-ying; Sun, Zheng; Zhou, Zhi-gang] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Minist Sci & Technol, Int Res Ctr Marine Biosci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Sun, Li-ping; Wang, Shi-ying; Sun, Zheng; Zhou, Zhi-gang] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Explorat & Utilizat Aquat Genet Resources, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Sun, Li-ping; Wang, Shi-ying; Sun, Zheng; Zhou, Zhi-gang] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Natl Demonstrat Ctr Expt Fisheries Sci Educ, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Lin, Carol Sze Ki] City Univ Hong Kong, Sch Energy & Environm, Kowloon, Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Shanghai Ocean University; Shanghai Ocean University; Shanghai Ocean University; Shanghai Ocean University; City University of Hong Kong","Sun, Z; Zhou, ZG (corresponding author), Shanghai Ocean Univ, Minist Sci & Technol, Int Res Ctr Marine Biosci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.","zsun@shou.edu.cn; zgzhou@shou.edu.cn","ZHOU, Zhi-Gang/V-9675-2019","Sun, Zheng/0000-0003-2690-8327; Lin, Carol Sze Ki/0000-0002-8493-4307","Special Project of Marine Renewable Energy from the State Oceanic Administration [SHME2011SW02]; NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund [U1706209]; State Double First-class Discipline Project of Aquaculture","Special Project of Marine Renewable Energy from the State Oceanic Administration; NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund; State Double First-class Discipline Project of Aquaculture","This work was financially supported by the Special Project of Marine Renewable Energy from the State Oceanic Administration (SHME2011SW02), NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund (U1706209), and State Double First-class Discipline Project of Aquaculture.",NA,"33","38","39","4","47","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1369-703X","1873-295X","","BIOCHEM ENG J","Biochem.

Adults survived for 20 days or more only at salinities less than or equal to 1000 mg l(-1) Cl; survival was higher at 10 degreesC than at 20 degreesC, and higher for females (86% at 10 degreesC, 14% at 20 degreesC) than males (43% at 10 degreesC, 0% at 20 degreesC). The mean total eggs produced per female in three successive clutches decreased with temperature from 20 eggs at 10 degreesC to 15 at 20 degreesC; egg production rates increased however, as clutches were produced more frequently. Staged increases in salinity did not increase copepod survival, indicating that B. hamata adults cannot tolerate the magnitude, or rate, of seasonal fluctuations in salinity to which they are exposed in the lake.

The value of this paper lies in two aspects: Mathematically, for the model without stochastic environmental fluctuations, we give the existence of boundary and positive equilibria, show the local and global stability of these equilibria, and prove the existence of Hopf bifurcation. For the model with stochastic environmental fluctuations, we provide the results related to the stochastic extinction and persistence in the mean, as well as the existence of ergodic stationary distribution. Ecologically, via numerical simulations, we find that plankton body size plays a key role in regulating the dynamics of interacting plankton in the deterministic and stochastic environments. It is worth emphasizing that the increase of phytoplankton cell size can stabilize the model by excluding the periodic solution induced by nutrient removal rate, while the increase of zooplankton body size can remain such periodic phenomena. Additionally, it should be noted that the very small phytoplankton cell size or zooplankton body size has a negative effect on the plankton growth in the stochastic fluctuation environments. These results may help to understand the complex dynamics of plankton models.","[Liao, Tiancai] Huaiyin Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Huaian 223300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Huaiyin Normal University","Liao, TC (corresponding author), Huaiyin Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Huaian 223300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.","liaotiancai2015@163.com","","Liao, Tiancai/0000-0001-6777-6063","Natural Science Foundation Project of Jiangsu Provincial Department of education, Jiangsu Province, China [21KJD110005]","Natural Science Foundation Project of Jiangsu Provincial Department of education, Jiangsu Province, China","Acknowledgment This research was supported by Natural Science Foundation Project of Jiangsu Provincial Department of education, Jiangsu Province, China (21KJD110005) .",NA,"62","0","0","10","13","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0577-9073","","","CHINESE J PHYS","Chin.

Under these conditions, light and relative humidity (RH) can fluctuate during the healing process, and growers need more research-based information regarding the impact of these factors on the survival of grafted transplants. To address this need, this study investigated the effect of different targeted levels of light (0%, 25%, and 50%) and RH (50% and 100%) (six combinations) in a small-scale healing chamber within a greenhouse, where the healing chamber was opened for increasing periods of time for 8 days, at which time plants were fully exposed to greenhouse conditions. The survival and growth of self-grafted eggplant (Solanum melongena), pepper (Capsicum annuum), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) were measured up to 25 days post grafting. Percent light in the closed healing chambers was similar for the 50% and 100% RH levels of each light treatment. When the healing chambers were closed, compared with the greenhouse, there was 0.1% light in the 0% light treatments, 25% light on average in the 25% light treatments, and 43% light on average in the 50% light treatments. On days 2 to 5 after grafting, when chambers were opened up to 1 hour, average RH in the healing chambers was 96% to 98% for the 100% RH treatments, and was 42% to 49% for the 50% RH treatments. On days 6 and 7, when chambers were opened for 3 to 8 hours, RH was 79% to 82% for the 100% RH treatments, and was 39% to 46% for the 50% RH treatments. Survival of grafted plants following healing was greatest when the healing chamber treatment was 100% RH and 50% or 25% light (95% and 90% survival, respectively), and plant survival with these two treatments did not significantly decline from 11 to 21 days after grafting, indicating plants were fully healed and acclimated when they were removed from the healing chambers on day 8. At 22 to 25 days following grafting, plants healed with 100% RH and 50% or 25% light had greater plant height, number of leaves per plant, and stem diameter than plants healed in the other light and RH combinations.

During the years 1982-1987 and 1991-1993, measurements of shoot dynamics and growth in populations of a clonal grass, Miscanthus sinensis, were made at two sites in Japan that differed by approximately 5 A degrees C in mean temperature. While annual shoot births were very stable during the period 1982-1987 at both sites, the number of flowering shoots fluctuated cyclically every year. The clonal propagation of shoots was size-independent, whereas the reproduction (flowering) of shoots was size-dependent and negatively affected their own offspring size. Shoot size negatively affected the overwintering of shoots. In the warm climate with a long growing period (9 months), both early-emerging shoots and the subsequent high order tillering shoots developed in large numbers. In the cool climate with a short growing period (6 months), more than half of the annual births occurred in August and September. Nevertheless, average longevity and wintering competency of shoots were not greatly different between the two populations. In response to a warmer climate, tillerings started earlier. This appeared to increase the total number of new shoots that would die within the year; nevertheless, the shoot densities remained much higher because a longer growing season would increase the number of high order tillerings. There was thus a trade-off between the annual survival ratio of new shoots and the number of annual shoot births.","[Kobayashi, Katsumi] 1-5-14 Higashi,Aoi Ku, Shizuoka 4200962, Japan; [Yokoi, Yota] 1319-5 Funako, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430034, Japan","","Kobayashi, K (corresponding author), 1-5-14 Higashi,Aoi Ku, Shizuoka 4200962, Japan.","k-kobayashi@sea.plala.or.jp","","","","","",NA,"83","3","3","0","10","SPRINGER JAPAN KK","TOKYO","SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN","0918-9440","1618-0860","","J PLANT RES","J.

Here, we aimed to understand how fine root phenology could change in subtropical broadleaved forests with increasing tree species diversity. Three 37-40 years old Castanopsis carlesii forests with low to high tree species diversity were selected in southern China: a plantation forest (PF), a secondary forest through the assisted regeneration (AR), and a secondary forest through natural regeneration (NR), with a nearby natural C. carlesii forest as a control. Fine root length production in these forests was measured monthly during January 2013 to December 2014 using minirhizotron, and fine root production phenology and its correlations with environmental factors were compared among these forests. No significant difference in fine root length production was found among these forests; however, there was distinct fine root phenology. The timing of fine root growth initiation and growth peak was quite stable across the two years in PF, while they were more flexible in AR and NR which were higher in tree species diversity. However, the timing of fine root growth cessation was quite fixed for all the forests. The duration and inter-annual stability of fine root growth both decreased with increasing tree species diversity. Moreover, the correlations of monthly fine root production with monthly air and soil temperature both increased with increasing tree species diversity. It is concluded that the timing of fine root growth in higher tree species diversity stand seems more flexible and more synchronous with seasonal and annual fluctuations of soil resources caused by weather variability, which helps our understanding of the relationships between tree diversity and ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling.","[Zhao, Haiying; Chen, Yunyu; Xiong, Decheng; Huang, Jinxue; Wang, Weiwei; Yang, Zhijie; Chen, Guangshui; Yang, Yusheng] Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov Funded, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Haiying] Tonghua Normal Univ, Sch Hist & Geog, Tonghua 134001, Peoples R China","Fujian Normal University; Tonghua Normal University","Chen, GS (corresponding author), Fujian Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Subtrop Mt Ecol, Minist Sci & Technol & Fujian Prov Funded, Fuzhou 350007, Fujian, Peoples R China.","gschen@fjnu.edu.cn","Chen, Guangshui/B-8065-2013","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31422012]; Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province [2014 J07005]; Graduated Student Science and Technology Innovation Project of the School of Geographical Science, Fujian Normal University [B2015116]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province); Graduated Student Science and Technology Innovation Project of the School of Geographical Science, Fujian Normal University","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31422012), the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2014 J07005), the Graduated Student Science and Technology Innovation Project of the School of Geographical Science, Fujian Normal University (B2015116).

To reveal the molecular mechanisms of their photosynthetic response to fluctuating light, we examined the role of two cyclic electron flows around photosystem I (CEF-PSI)-one depending on PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 (PGR5) and one on NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH)-in photosynthetic regulation under fluctuating light in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The impairment of PGR5-dependent CEF-PSI suppressed the photosynthetic response immediately after sudden irradiation, whereas the impairment of NDH-dependent CEF-PSI did not. However, the impairment of either PGR5-dependent or NDH-dependent CEF-PSI reduced the photosynthetic rate under fluctuating light, leading to photoinhibition at PSI and consequently a reduction in plant biomass. The results highlight that (1) PGR5-dependent CEF-PSI is a key regulator of rapid photosynthetic responses to high light intensity under fluctuating light conditions after constant high light; and (2) both PGR5-dependent and NDH-dependent CEF-PSI have physiological roles in sustaining photosynthesis and plant growth in rice under repeated light fluctuations. The highly responsive regulatory system managed by CEF-PSI appears able to optimize photosynthesis and plant growth under naturally fluctuating light conditions.","[Yamori, Wataru] Chiba Univ, Ctr Environm Hlth & Field Sci, 6-2-1 Kashiwa No Ha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2770882, Japan; [Makino, Amane] Tohoku Univ, Dept Appl Plant Sci, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Aoba Ku, 1-1 Tsutsumidori Amamiyamachi, Sendai, Miyagi 9818555, Japan; [Shikanai, Toshiharu] Kyoto Univ, Dept Bot, Grad Sch Sci, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Yamori, Wataru] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, PRESTO, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Makino, Amane; Shikanai, Toshiharu] JST, CREST, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan","Chiba University; Tohoku University; Kyoto University; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)","Yamori, W (corresponding author), Chiba Univ, Ctr Environm Hlth & Field Sci, 6-2-1 Kashiwa No Ha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2770882, Japan.;Yamori, W (corresponding author), Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, PRESTO, 4-1-8 Honcho, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan.","wataru.yamori@chiba-u.jp","Yamori, Wataru/C-5680-2011; Shikanai, Toshiharu/AAK-9112-2020","Yamori, Wataru/0000-0001-7215-4736; ","Japan Science and Technology Agency, PRESTO; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25891005]; NC-CARP/GRENE project; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K20962, 25891005, 16H06379] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Science and Technology Agency, PRESTO(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); NC-CARP/GRENE project; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency, PRESTO (to W.Y.) and in part by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Scientific Research No. 25891005 to W.Y.) and by an NC-CARP/GRENE project (to A.M. and T.S.).",NA,"31","186","192","3","116","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","LONDON","MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND","2045-2322","","","SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","FEB 2","2016","6","","",NA,"",NA,"","","20147","10.1038/srep20147","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep20147","","","12","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","DC3SM","26832990","Green Published, gold","Y","N","2023-04-18","WOS:000369139100002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

One ecologically relevant approach consists of examining the thermal responses of a large number of traits, both related with population dynamics and trophic interactions (i.e. a multi-trait approach). Based on in situ climatic data and projections from climate models, we here designed two daily fluctuating thermal regimes realistically reflecting current and future conditions in Eastern France. These models detected an increase in mean temperature and in the range of daily thermal fluctuations as two local facets of global warming likely to occur in our study area by the end of this century. We then examined the responses of several fitness-related traits in caterpillars of the moth Lobesia botrana - including development, pupal mass, survival rates, energetic reserves, behavioral and immune traits expressed against parasitoids - to this experimental imitation of global warming. Increasing temperatures positively affected development (leading to a 31% reduction in the time needed to complete larval stage), survival rates (+19%), and movement speed as a surrogate for larval escape ability to natural enemies ( + 60%). Conversely, warming elicited detrimental effects on lipid reserves ( - 26%) and immunity (total phenoloxidase activity: - 34%). These findings confirm that traits should differ in their sensitivity to global warming, underlying complex consequences for population dynamics and trophic interactions. Our study strengthens the importance of combining a multi-trait approach with the use of realistic fluctuating regimes to forecast the consequences of global warming for individuals, species and species assemblages.","[Iltis, Corentin; Loudare, Philippe; Pecharova, Karolina; Zito, Sebastien; Bois, Benjamin; Moreau, Jerome] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UMR CNRS Biogeosci 6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France; [Thiery, Denis] Inst Sci Vigne & Vin, UMR INRA Sante & Agroecol Vignoble 1065, 71 Ave Edouard Bourlaux, F-33882 Villenave Dornon, France","Universite de Bourgogne; INRAE","Iltis, C (corresponding author), Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, UMR CNRS Biogeosci 6282, 6 Blvd Gabriel, F-21000 Dijon, France.","corentin.iltis@u-bourgogne.fr","","Bois, Benjamin/0000-0001-7114-2071; Moreau, Jerome/0000-0001-9984-0998","Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte (PARI); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte (VALEACLIM-BOIS); European Union (PO FEDER-FSE Bourgogne 2014/2020 programs); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte (FABER LOUAPRE-AGREE-BGS)","Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte (PARI); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte (VALEACLIM-BOIS); European Union (PO FEDER-FSE Bourgogne 2014/2020 programs); Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte (FABER LOUAPRE-AGREE-BGS)","This work was supported by the Conseil Regional de Bourgogne Franche-Comte (PARI, FABER LOUAPRE-AGREE-BGS and VALEACLIM-BOIS), and the European Union (PO FEDER-FSE Bourgogne 2014/2020 programs).",NA,"69","13","13","1","32","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0022-1910","1879-1611","","J INSECT PHYSIOL","J.

They support fast-growing annual herbs with a ruderal strategy. To optimize their recruitment success, seeds of mudflat species germinate better under fluctuating temperatures, full illumination and aerobic environments that indicate the presence of optimal (non-flooded) conditions for plant growth and development. Here, we hypothesize that prior exposure of mudflat seeds to hypoxic (flooded) environment interferes with the germination process and results in more vigorous germination once aerobic conditions are regained. To test this hypothesis, seeds of five mudflat species were incubated in both aerobic and hypoxic environments at four (14/6, 22/14, 22/22 and 30/22 degrees C) temperature regimes, reflecting different (seasonal) conditions when drawdowns may occur. All species responded positively to four temperature regimes; however, moderate 22/14 and 22/22 degrees C temperatures were optimum for high percentages and rates (speed) of seed germination. Since seeds of four species germinated exclusively under aerobic conditions, they were moved from hypoxic to aerobic conditions. Prior exposure of seeds to hypoxic environment facilitated high percentages, rates and synchronization of germination of Limosella aquatica, Peplis portula and Samolus valerandi seeds compared to incubation under strict aerobic conditions. However, prior exposure to hypoxic environment induced secondary dormancy in non-dormant seeds of Hypericum humifusum but broke dormancy in Lythrum hyssopifolia seeds that otherwise required cold stratification to overcome physiological dormancy. All species that have a narrow ecological niche (strictly occurring in mudflat habitats) showed positive responses to prior exposure to hypoxic environments. In contrast, H. humifusum that has a wide ecological niche (from mudflats to moist sandy grasslands) showed a negative response. We conclude that the hypoxic environment may strongly affect seed germination behaviour once the aerobic environment is regained. The most striking effect is the acceleration of the germination process and, therefore, life cycle supporting the survival in an ephemeral habitat.","[Phartyal, Shyam S.; Rosbakh, Sergey; Poschlod, Peter] Univ Regensburg, Inst Plant Sci, Ecol & Conservat Biol, Regensburg, Germany; [Phartyal, Shyam S.] Nalanda Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Studies, Rajgir, India","University of Regensburg","Phartyal, SS (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Inst Plant Sci, Ecol & Conservat Biol, Regensburg, Germany.;Phartyal, SS (corresponding author), Nalanda Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Studies, Rajgir, India.","shyamphartyal@gmail.com","PHARTYAL, SHYAM S./H-4229-2019; Rosbakh, Sergey/AAO-8524-2020","PHARTYAL, SHYAM S./0000-0003-3266-6619; Rosbakh, Sergey/0000-0002-4599-6943; Poschlod, Peter/0000-0003-4473-7656","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany","Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation)","We thank the students, who helped with the seed collection and germination experiment.

Here, the cracks are large enough in comparison with the grains in the material, so that the inhomogeneity due to the microstructure can be ignored. However, in the gas-turbine blade, the size of grain is relatively larger than that in conventional plant components, and the crack propagation property may be affected by the local grain configuration. Here, in order to clarify the crack propagation property of an anisotropic material (Ni-based directionally solidified superalloy for the gas-turbine blades), high temperature fatigue tests are conducted using longitudinal loading specimens with a crack (L-specimens) and transverse loading ones (T-specimens). The crack propagation rate is roughly correlated well with the effective stress intensity factor range regardless of the propagation direction (specimens L and T), the stress range, and the stress ratio. In detail, however, the crack propagation rate shows eminent fluctuation particularly in the T-specimens. It is about 5 times faster than the average at most. The feature of fracture surface can be classified into 4-types where 3 of them are transgranular and the other is intergranular. In the former, though the crack is along {100} or {110} planes in the macroscopic scale, it threads through {111} or {100} planes in the microscopic scale.

Understanding pest population dynamics and factors affecting them is important for predicting pest outbreaks and constructing the management strategy. Aphids are among the major pest groups in bean crops and aphid outbreaks can frequently occur when the management is inappropriate. In the present study, we examined the population fluctuation and abundance of aphid species and their associated predators and parasitoids in faba bean fields during 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons in Kafr EL-Shiekh, Egypt. Among four pest aphids detected, Aphis craccivora was the most dominant, followed by Acyrthosiphon pisum while Aphis gossypii and Myzus persicae were found in low densities throughout the season. Although A. craccivora was detected throughout the growing season, the density is notably high in the early growth stage of faba bean. Among the predators, Chrysoperta carnea and true spiders (Singa sp. and Dictyna sp. were most abundant, followed by Coccinella undecimpunctata.

The complex interactions among these factors highlight the need for physiology-based models which describe seedling and sapling performance under current and changing climatic conditions. These models should be flexible enough to take into account the effect of growth light environment changes on physiological processes and, therefore, to assist in the decision-making process on different silvicultural management alternatives under climatic uncertainty. In the present work the net photosynthesic rate of Pinus pinea L. natural regeneration is modeled as a function of light irradiance using the non-rectangular hyperbola function. The model fit was carried out following a two-step procedure, where the parameters of the original function were expanded over the most influential factors: leaf temperature, soil moisture, global site factor and needle type. The developed model allows defining the optimal niche conditions for the natural regeneration of the species and permits identifying the most limiting conditions which prevent natural regeneration. Regeneration niche was assessed by using the model to simulate net CO2 assimilation of a seedling over twelve contrasting light environments during both a normal and an extremely dry vegetative period. The model predicts that the most favorable carbon balance would be found in mid-shaded expositions, while fully exposed plants at midday during summer would exhibit longer periods of negative assimilation rates, especially on severe dry years.

To optimize the growth conditions for the production of target compounds and to ensure profitability in commercial applications, the effects of pH and temperature were investigated. A. maxima has been shown to be tolerant to a range of pH conditions and to exhibit hyper-accumulation of phycoerythrin and allophycocyanin at low temperatures. These traits may offer significant advantages for future exploitation, especially in outdoor cultivation with fluctuating pH and temperature. Our study also demonstrated a new method for the purification of phycocyanin from A. maxima by using by ultrafiltration, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration, producing PC at 1.0 mg center dot mL(-1) with 97.6% purity. Arthrospira maxima is a natural source of fine chemicals for multiple biotechnological applications. We determined the optimal environmental conditions for A. maxima by measuring its relative growth rate (RGR), pigment yield, and photosynthetic performance under different pH and temperature conditions. RGR was highest at pH 7-9 and 30 degrees C. Chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, maximal quantum yield (F-v/F-m), relative maximal electron transport rate (rETR(max)), and effective quantum yield (phi(PSII)) were highest at pH 7-8 and 25 degrees C. Interestingly, phycoerythrin and allophycocyanin content was highest at 15 degrees C, which may be the lowest optimum temperature reported for phycobiliprotein production in the Arthrospira species. A threestep purification of phycocyanin (PC) by ultrafiltration, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration resulted in a 97.6% purity of PC.","[Park, Jihae; Lee, Hojun; Han, Taejun] Univ Ghent, Dev & Planning Off, Global Campus,119-5,Songdomunhwa Ro, Incheon 21985, South Korea; [Park, Jihae; Depuydt, Stephen] Univ Ghent, Lab Plant Growth Anal, Global Campus,119-5 Songdomunhwa Ro, Incheon 21985, South Korea; [Dinh, Thai Binh] Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Cosmet Sci & Management, 119 Acad Ro, Incheon 22012, South Korea; [Choi, Soyeon; Han, Taejun] Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Marine Sci, 119 Acad Ro, Incheon 22012, South Korea; [De Saeger, Jonas] Univ Ghent, Dept Plant Biotechnol & Bioinformat, Technol Pk 71, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium; [Brown, Murray T.] Plymouth Univ, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Han, Taejun] Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Coupure Links 653 Block F, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium","Ghent University; Ghent University; Incheon National University; Incheon National University; Ghent University; University of Plymouth; Ghent University","Han, T (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dev & Planning Off, Global Campus,119-5,Songdomunhwa Ro, Incheon 21985, South Korea.;Han, T (corresponding author), Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Marine Sci, 119 Acad Ro, Incheon 22012, South Korea.;Han, T (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Anim Sci & Aquat Ecol, Coupure Links 653 Block F, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","jihae.park@ghent.ac.kr; hojun.lee@ugent.be; thaibinhnt2@gmail.com; chlthdus0501@hanmail.net; jonas.desaeger@ghent.ac.kr; stephen.depuydt@ghent.ac.kr; m.t.brown@plymouth.ac.uk; hanalgae@hanmail.net","Brown, Murray/K-5291-2014","Brown, Murray/0000-0003-2655-8611; Park, Jihae/0000-0002-1873-1480","National Institute of Environment Research (NIER) - Ministry of Environment (MOE) of the Republic of Korea [NIER-2020-03-01-010]","National Institute of Environment Research (NIER) - Ministry of Environment (MOE) of the Republic of Korea","This research was supported by the National Institute of Environment Research (NIER) and funded by the Ministry of Environment (MOE) of the Republic of Korea (NIER-2020-03-01-010).",NA,"129","5","5","2","9","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2079-7737","","BIOLOGY-BASEL","Biology-Basel","MAY","2022","11","5","",NA,"",NA,"","","628","10.3390/biology11050628","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11050628","","","18","Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics","1P3TO","35625356","Green Published, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000801935600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

It was found that garlic and GHG-L cultivated in adverse conditions, exhibited lower yielding rates, but the content of allicin was inversely proportional to the biomass.

Here, we use long-term annual data on green spruce aphid populations at nine localities in the UK for determining the importance of endogenous processes, local weather and large-scale climatic factors. We rely on diagnostic and modelling tools from population dynamic theory to analyse these long-term data and to determine the role of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and local weather as exogenous factors influencing aphid dynamics. Our modelling suggests that the key elements determining population fluctuations in green spruce aphid populations in the UK are the strong non-linear feedback structure, the high potential for population growth and the effects of winter and spring weather. The results indicate that the main effect of the NAO on green spruce aphid populations is operating through the effect of winter temperatures on the maximum per capita growth rate (R-m). In particular, we can predict quite accurately the occurrence of an outbreak by using a simple logistic model with weather as a perturbation effect. However, model predictions using different climatic variables showed a clear geographical signature. The NAO and winter temperature were best for predicting observed dynamics toward the southern localities, while spring temperature was a much better predictor of aphid dynamics at northern localities. Although aphid species are characterized by complex life-cycles, we emphasize the value of simple and general population dynamic models in predicting their dynamics.","[Lima, Mauricio; Saldana, Silverio; Estay, Sergio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile; [Harrington, Richard] Rothamsted Res, Plant & Invertebrate Ecol Dept, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England","Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research","Lima, M (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Casilla 14-D,CL-6513677, Santiago, Chile.","mlima@bio.puc.cl","Lima, Mauricio/F-2722-2013","Lima, Mauricio/0000-0002-3700-2945; Estay, Sergio/0000-0002-3797-8964","","","",NA,"38","30","31","0","19","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0030-1299","1600-0706","","OIKOS","Oikos","JUN","2008","117","6","",NA,"",NA,"951","959","","10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16615.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16615.x","","","9","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","314WG",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000256839300017","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The experiment was set up in a bifactorial split-plot design with 4 replications. The mean values of the growth indices were calculated using the classic method of growth analysis, while the Hunt-Parsons (1974) growth analysis programme was used for the functional method of growth analysis. The following indices of growth analysis were calculated to characterise the effect of sowing date: crop growth rate (CGR), relative growth rate (RGR), leaf area index (LAI), net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area growth rate (ALGR) and biomass duration (BMD). The Hunt-Parsons programme characterised the dynamics of total dry matter production with a third-degree exponential polynomial. Sowing date had differing effects on dry matter accumulation in the vegetative and reproductive growth stages. In the case of the late solving date dry matter accumulation was greater during the initial phase of vegetative growth, but terminated sooner due to early flowering, leading to a significantly lower maximum dry matter production per plant after late sowing than for the early sowing date. Average and early sowing dates were favourable for both vegetative and reproductive growth. Sowing date had different effects on the dynamics and mean values of the growth indices in the vegetative and reproductive stages of growth. In the initial phase of vegetative growth the values of the growth indices were greater after late sowing than after early or average sowing dates. In the reproductive growth stage, however, the values of the indices were greatest in the early and average sowing date treatments and smallest after late sowing. The dynamics and mean values of the growth indices calculated with the classic method and using the HP model expressed similar tendencies for the effect of sowing date. The greatest fluctuation from the regular was observed in the growth dynamics of CGR and NAR calculated with the classic method. Studies on the correlation between maize grain yields and growth indices revealed the importance of the growth indices examined. On the basis of R-2, the multiple determination coefficient, 90-91 % of the variance of the maize grain yield was determined by growth indices and climatic factors. Path analysis showed that during the vegetative growth stage LAI had a greater effect on CGR than NAR. In the reproductive growth stage, however, CGR depended more on NAR than on LAI. Despite the obvious advantages of the Hunt-Parsons growth analysis programme, the combined use of the classic and functional methods is to be recommended.","MTA, Mezogazdasagi Kutatointezete, H-2462 Martonvasar, Hungary","","Berzsenyi, Z (corresponding author), MTA, Mezogazdasagi Kutatointezete, Brunszvik U 1, H-2462 Martonvasar, Hungary.","","","","","","",NA,"31","4","4","1","4","ALLAMI NYOMDA","BUDAPEST","KAPISZTRAN TER 1, 1 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY","0546-8191","","","NOVENYTERMELES","Novenytermeles","DEC","1998","47","6","",NA,"",NA,"655","676","","","","","","22","Agronomy","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture","177PQ",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000079219700007","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These tailings ponds can be used to grow organisms, such as algae, which, in turn, fix CO2 and degrade unwanted dissolved components. After processing, algae can be used for the production of fuels (for example, biodiesel or methane). In this work, we explored the potential for growth of a unicellular algae, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, in tailings water from an oil sands mining and upgrading operation. Once we determined that it was possible to grow algae in the tailings water, we designed and optimized minimal growth media for biomass (algae) production and did a preliminary engineering estimate of the potential for CO2 fixation. The medium components required for growth of C. pyrenoidosa in 95% oil sands tailings water (OSTW) were screened using a two-level full factorial experiment. Sodium nitrate, phosphate, and Fe-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were the most important medium components. After this work, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to find the optimum concentrations of these nutrients. The optimum concentrations of sodium nitrate, phosphate, Fe-EDTA, and trace metal solution were 11.9 mM, 9.4 mM, 49.5 mu M and 2 mL/L, respectively. On the basis of an optimized specific growth rate of 0.085 g L-1 day(-1), it was estimated that 12 million tons/year of CO2 could be fixed by C. pyrenoidosa growing in the tailings ponds in the Athabasca region of Canada.

In 1964, four IO-ha plots were established within the original area to determine the effect of slope aspect on plant growth and demography. The plots were recensused in 1970 and 1993. We developed a model for determining saguaro age,using the growth rates of over 3000 plants from 1964 to 1970. The model was verified with 1993 data. Changes in population size and the estimated age structures were then used to infer regeneration trends. Saguaro populations on all slope aspects nearly doubled since 1908. Yet, during the same period, relative abundances of saguaros remained higher on the south and east aspects than on the north and west aspects. Higher recruitment and survival of young plants rather than mortality of older ones are largely responsible for the differences between aspects. The estimated age structures show large, multi-decadal fluctuations in saguaro regeneration. Prior to 1908, populations on all slopes experienced an extended period of decline beginning around the late 1860s. The recent surge in recruitment began in the 1920s and peaked in the 1970s. Populations currently are again in decline. Better regeneration generally corresponds with relatively wet conditions, and poorer regeneration with drier conditions. However, extended periods of decline often included episodes of relatively wet conditions (e.g., from the 1860s to the 1920s), indicating that other climatic and biotic factors also determine recruitment success. Establishment may have been suppressed by colder winters, livestock grazing, and rock quarrying. This long-term study demonstrates that, despite low regeneration and population decline during much of the last two centuries, saguaros have persisted on Tumamoc Hill because of episodic surges in seedling establishment.","Univ Arizona, Desert Lab Tumamoc Hill, Tucson, AZ 85745 USA; US Geol Survey, Tucson, AZ 85745 USA","University of Arizona; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey","Pierson, EA (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Plant Pathol, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.","","","Pierson, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8867-0743","","","",NA,"56","120","123","0","116","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0012-9658","1939-9170","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","DEC","1998","79","8","",NA,"",NA,"2676","2693","","10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2676:AYSOSC]2.0.CO;2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2676:AYSOSC]2.0.CO;2","","","18","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","148JF",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000077501000008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, marine environmental data are commonly of limited availability. Moreover, the mechanisms by which environmental variations may act to regulate fish recruitment remain incompletely understood, especially from the point of view of prey availability. Here we report a test of the feasibility of using simulated long-term hindcast of marine environmental data based on a physical and lower-trophic-level ecosystem data-assimilative model to investigate the impacts of water temperature and prey availability on recruitment fluctuations of the Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) in the Yellow Sea. Although observational data available for model validation were limited, the model reasonably reproduced inter-annual fluctuations of phytoplankton abundance. The model results for a 15-year period (1987-2001) indicated Japanese anchovy recruitment to have been negatively correlated with July sea surface temperature in the traditional spawning ground south of the Shandong Peninsula, while being positively correlated with near-surface biomass of small zooplankton (the predominant prey for anchovy larvae) in the central Yellow Sea during the summer period. These findings imply that the Japanese anchovy recruitment in the Yellow Sea is likely regulated during its early life stages by both water temperature and food availability. The negative temperature-recruitment relationship could be explained by the spawning temperature optima and optimal growth temperature hypotheses. Furthermore, model results indicated that inter-annual variation in the near-surface biomass of small zooplankton in the central Yellow Sea during summer is mainly regulated by nutrient supply, to which both vertical stratification and horizontal advection may make contributions.","[Yu, Haiqing; Tian, Yongjun; Liu, Yang; Xing, Qinwang] Ocean Univ China, Coll Fisheries, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Yu, Huaming] Ocean Univ China, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Yu, Huaming] Ocean Univ China, Sanya Oceanog Inst, Sanya 572024, Peoples R China; [Ito, Shin-ichi] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan; [Tian, Yongjun; Liu, Yang] Ocean Univ China, Inst Adv Ocean Study, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hui] Natl Marine Environm Forecasting Ctr, Beijing 100086, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hui] Shandong Univ, Inst Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China; [Bakun, Andrew] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Kelly, Ryan M.] Rykell Sci Editorial LLC, Los Angeles, CA USA","Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; University of Tokyo; Ocean University of China; National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center; Shandong University; University of Miami","Yu, HM (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Coll Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.","yuhaiqing@ouc.edu.cn; hmyu@ouc.edu.cn; goito@aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp; wangh@nmefc.cn; yangliu315@ouc.edu.cn","Liu, Yang/AAK-3617-2020; xing, qinwang/GQY-4526-2022; Ito, Shin-ichi/E-2981-2012","xing, qinwang/0000-0003-4854-320X; Ito, Shin-ichi/0000-0002-3635-2580; Kelly, Ryan M./0000-0003-2322-2848; Liu, Yang/0000-0001-8548-0223","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1401406, 2016YFC1401800, 2018YFD0900902]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41930534]; JSPS KAKENHI [JP15H05823, JP18H03956]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We would like to thank the staff from the First Institute of Oceanography, MNR China for sharing the hydrological data used for our model validation.

In addition, 30 fish ( I I carrying ultrasonic transmitters) were fitted with archival temperature-logging tags to record temperatures encountered by Gulf sturgeon over the course of a year, including both their riverine and estuarine residency. Movement rates of Gulf sturgeon in the Suwannee River were greatest during the upstream migration in March and April 2001 (4.8 km/d) and upon their emigration from the river in September 2001 (6.4 and 16.0 km/d for males and females, respectively). Mean maximum distance that fish were relocated upstream was significantly greater for male Gulf sturgeon (165 km) than for females (126 km). This may relate to female Gulf sturgeon not spawning annually and thus not migrating to putative spawning grounds upriver. In contrast, rates of upstream movement did not differ significantly between sexes. Movements in the nearshore regions of the Suwannee River estuary did not differ between males and females (0.8 and 2.2 km/d, respectively), and was much lower than in the river. Three Gulf sturgeon hearing archival temperature tags were recovered in subsequent netting activities in 2002. Data downloaded from the tags demonstrated that on average Gulf sturgeon were exposed to a 13 degrees C annual flux in temperature, ranging from 26 degrees C in the river during the summer to 13 degrees C in the estuary in the winter, although individual fish experienced as much as a 20 degrees C range (8.1-28.5 degrees C) over the course of a year. Given the influence of temperature on the metabolism of ectotherms such as sturgeon, this broad fluctuation in temperature may have profound implications for the bioenergetics, and hence growth and reproduction, of Gulf sturgeon.","[Parkyn, Daryl C.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Zool, Box 7617, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Colle, Douglas E.; Holloway, James D.] Univ Florida, IFAS, Dept Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA","North Carolina State University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Parkyn, DC (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Zool, Box 7617, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.","dparkyn@ufl.edu","","","sturgeon research initiative from the State of Florida Legislature under the auspices of the Florida Sturgeon Production Working Group; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, St. Petersburg, Florida","sturgeon research initiative from the State of Florida Legislature under the auspices of the Florida Sturgeon Production Working Group; Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, St. Petersburg, Florida","We thank the many people at University of Florida who assisted in collection of data for this study, in particular P.

Several important chemical transformations take place in wetland media, including the conversion of inorganic mercury (Hg) to monomethylmercury (MeHg), a toxic compound with a strong tendency for bioconcentration. Considering the fact that wetlands are hotspots for Hg methylation, we investigated, for the first time, Hg methylation and demethylation rates in an old growth cypress wetland at Sky Lake in the Mississippi Delta. The Sky Lake ecosystem undergoes large-scale water level fluctuations causing alternating periods of oxic and anoxic conditions in the sediment. These oscillating redox conditions, in turn, can influence the transformation, speciation, and bioavailability of Hg. In the present study, sediment cores from the wetland and Sky Lake itself were spiked with enriched stable isotope tracers of inorganic Hg and MeHg and allowed to incubate (in-situ) before freezing, sectioning, and analysis. Methylation rates (day(-1)) ranged from 0.012 +/- 0.003 to 0.054 +/- 0.019, with the lowest rate in the winter and the highest in the summer. Demethylation rates were about two orders of magnitude higher, and also greater in the warmer seasons (e.g., 1.84 +/- 0.78 and 4.63 +/- 0.51 for wetland sediment in the winter and summer, respectively). Methylation rates were generally higher in the open water sediment compared to wetland sediment, with the latter shaded and cooler. Both methylation (r = 0.76, p = 0.034) and demethylation (0.97, p = 0.016) rates (day(-1)) were positively correlated with temperature, but not with most other water quality parameters. MeHg concentration in the water was correlated with pH (r = 0.80, p < 0.05), but methylation rates were only marginally correlated (r = 0.71). Environmental factors driving microbial production of MeHg in the system include warm temperatures, high levels of labile natural organic matter, and to a lesser extent the relatively low pH and the residence time of the water. This study also provides baseline data that can be used to quantify the impacts of modifying the natural flow of water to the system on Hg methylation and demethylation rates.","[Bussan, Derek D.] Eastern Kentucky Univ, Dept Chem, Richmond, KY 40475 USA; [Bussan, Derek D.; Cizdziel, James, V] Univ Mississippi, Dept Chem & Biochem, University, MS 38677 USA; [Douvris, Chris] New York Inst Technol, Dept Biol & Chem Sci, Old Westbury, NY 11568 USA","University of Mississippi; New York Institute Technology","Bussan, DD (corresponding author), Eastern Kentucky Univ, Dept Chem, Richmond, KY 40475 USA.;Bussan, DD; Cizdziel, JV (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Chem & Biochem, University, MS 38677 USA.","derek.bussan@eku.edu; cdouvris@nyit.edu; cizdziel@olemiss.edu","","Cizdziel, James/0000-0002-4107-0190","","","",NA,"37","3","3","5","7","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1420-3049","","MOLECULES","Molecules","AUG","2022","27","15","",NA,"",NA,"","","4911","10.3390/molecules27154911","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules27154911","","","15","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry","3S9GL","35956861","gold, Green Published","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000839895600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Despite its high dietary-medicinal value, the plant is still regarded as a weed in many Provinces of South Africa while the conditions necessary for its optimum growth in the wild are still obscure. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the effect of various environmental factors and sowing depth on the germination of two types of seeds of C. gynandra in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The result shows that the average seed weight was 1.2 +/- 0.003 mg and the viability of Lot A and B were 22.6 +/- 2.3% and 67.3 +/- 5.0% respectively. The optimum germination was achieved at 30 degrees C for both Lots A and B when watered biweekly at a sowing depth of 0.5 cm. The result also showed that germination was best in the dark (28.7%) for both Lot A and B. In overall, the germination rate under all the conditions was highest in Lot B.

Modern conventional power plants must be able to compensate fluctuations in residual load, caused by renewable energy sources. This results in higher numbers of start-up and shut-down cycles and therefore in more damaging loading scenarios than in the past. Due to the ever shorter operating time at constant high temperature, the importance of creep damage decreases, while fatigue damage gains in importance. Furthermore probable interactions of fatigue damage and steam atmosphere have to be considered. For this reason the influence of steam on the crack propagation behavior in X20 was investigated in detail. Steam oxidation strongly depends on temperature and time, i.e. on fatigue testing frequency and temperature. The effect of steam on crack propagation behavior was found to be not generally detrimental (for R = 0.1). Experiments with 3.33 x 10(-3) Hz (300 s hold time) in the temperature range from 400 degrees C to 550 degrees C yielded significantly higher Delta K values to start crack propagation in comparison to experiments performed in air. In the temperature range from 300 degrees C to 550 degrees C the crack growth rate under steam atmosphere in the worst case corresponds to that measured in air, while in the best case it was found to be lower. Generally crack propagation in steam atmosphere was found to be accelerated at increased testing frequency (5 Hz, 20 Hz) starting from 500 degrees C up to higher temperature.","[Fischer, T.; Kuhn, B.] Forschungszentrum Juelich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK, Microstruct & Properties Mat IEK 2, Julich, Germany","Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich","Fischer, T (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Juelich, Inst Energy & Climate Res IEK, Microstruct & Properties Mat IEK 2, Julich, Germany.","t.fischer@fz-juelich.de","Kuhn, Bernd/H-6488-2019","Kuhn, Bernd/0000-0002-7929-0711; Fischer, Torsten/0000-0003-0735-6993","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy [03ET7024A]","German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy","The authors gratefully acknowledge the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy supporting this study under grant No. 03ET7024A.

Gravid females were collected twice monthly and incubated for 12 h without food to estimate EPR, weight-specific fecundity (GO, spawning success (SS, percentage of females to spawn out of the total species incubated per month and season) and egg hatching success (EHS). This study reports the average EPR of 10 species and the monthly EPR and Gf of four planktonic calanoid copepods (Centropages furcatus, Temora discaudata, Pontellina sobrina, and Nannocalanus minor) that spawned with enough frequency to infer their seasonal reproductive patterns. These species showed distinct seasonal reproductive strategies. Most copepod species spawned sporadically with large EPR variability, while three copepod species reproduced throughout the year (C. furcatus, T discaudata and P. sobrina) and N. minor spawned only during the mixed period (Feb May). The four species had relatively similar average EPR (C furcatus 16, T discaudata 18, P. sobrina 13, and N. minor 12 eggs fem(-1) day(-1)). These are the first EPR estimations of P. sobrina and its previously known reproductive period is expanded. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to analyze EPR and species abundance of all calanoid copepods (40 spp.) collected throughout the time series in relation to temperature, salinity, mixed layer depth (MLD), dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations to identify the variables that best explained the copepod abundance variability. Temperature, Chl-a, and salinity had the strongest effect on the biological variables, linked to seasonal and episodic upwelling-downwelling processes in the surveyed area. As a result of moderate upwelling events and seasonal variation of environmental conditions, it appears relatively few species are capable of maintaining continuous reproduction under the relatively higher temperatures and strong fluctuations of food availability that exist in this coastal habitat of the Eastern Tropical Pacific.

The larvae were analyzed for growth, feeding efficiency and nitrogen budgets as a function of host plant, nutrient content and temperature. Furthermore, the reproductive success of females was tested according to the host plants used as food during their larval stage. Within the temperature range from 5-degrees to 20-degrees-C consumption rate (RCR) and growth rate (RGR) of larvae increased but the overall efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) was unaffected. Using an alternating regime with daily temperatures fluctuating by 10-degrees-C over a period of 12 h, each RGR and the maximum larval weight were the same as found at the mean constant temperature. An alternating regime, however, did increase the RCR of larvae. Feeding performance of larvae was also affected by the host plants. Food consumption increased with decreasing plant quality. Although the increase in RCR did not, however, prevent a total decline in RGR, both, the maximum larval weight and the weight of freshly emerged females were similar between the various trials conducted. The results indicate that the consumption and utilization of food are dynamic processes and that caterpillars in early spring exhibit compensatory responses to changes in temperature as well as to the host plant. An analysis of both the nutrient content (nitrogen and water) of the willow species and of the caterpillar utilization indices upon each host plant did not show any consistent trends. If larvae fed later in the season rather than in the early spring, such compensatory responses were not found. Instead, a decline in RGR, feeding time and/or RCR occurred resulting in a lowering of the maximum weight of larvae hatching at a later time. The mean weight of females according to the different willow species upon which the larvae had fed, did not differ from the mean weight of females originating from oak trees; nor are there differences in fecundity. Hence, winter moth caterpillars may find adequate host plants in early spring before oak bud burst occurs. At the time of oak leaf flush, however, the quality of foliage of at least some willow species may already be suboptimal for O. brumata development.","UNIV COLOGNE, INST ZOOL, LEHRSTUHL PHYSIOL OKOL 3, WEYERTAL 119, W-5000 COLOGNE 41, GERMANY","University of Cologne","","","","","","","",NA,"46","11","12","1","3","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0931-2048","1439-0418","","J APPL ENTOMOL","J.

Although reductions in tree growth have previously been associated with forest decline, comprehensive efforts to understand these relationships are rare. Based on ring width variations, we determine the influence of climatic fluctuations on the onset and temporal evolution of Nothofagus pumilio forest decline in the Patagonian Andes. Basal area increment (BM) data from 294 Nothofagus trees at 11 stands in a 500-km latitudinal transect along the forest steppe ecotone were used to identify the dominant patterns of regional growth. Three Regional dominant patterns, showing common variations in BM, were derived. Two BA1 patterns show high rates of growth from early to mid-20th century, followed by sustained negative trends over the last 3-6 decades, whereas the third pattern is characterized by a positive trend since the 1960s. Tipping points in growth trends of the first two patterns are associated with two extreme dry warm climate events in spring summer of 1942-1943/1943-1944/1944-1945 and 1978-1979. Both severe droughts were preceded by up to 10 yr of wet periods that promoted above average tree growth. We concluded that severe droughts occurring after wet periods trigger the decline of large, dominant N. pumilio trees with high rates of growth. The coincidence between major changes in regional growth with two of the most severe droughts in the instrumental records shows that climatic variations over northern Patagonia synchronize the beginning of forest decline at a regional scale. As these dry-mesic N. pumilio sites will face more severe droughts in the 21st century, as suggested by future climate scenarios, the areas affected by forest decline would increase substantially.","[Rodriguez-Caton, Milagros; Villalba, Ricardo; Morales, Mariano; Srur, Ana] IANIGLA CONICET, Inst Argentino Nivol Glaciol & Ciencias Ambiental, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University Nacional Cuyo Mendoza","Rodriguez-Caton, M (corresponding author), IANIGLA CONICET, Inst Argentino Nivol Glaciol & Ciencias Ambiental, RA-5500 Mendoza, Argentina.","mrodriguez@mendoza-conicet.gob.ar","Rodriguez-Caton, Milagros/GRE-8611-2022","Rodriguez-Caton, Milagros/0000-0002-9608-0150; Villalba, Ricardo/0000-0001-8183-0310; Srur, Ana M./0000-0001-8533-5296","Consejo National de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Argentina [PIP 112-2011010-0809]; Australian Research Council [ARC DP120104320]; Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) - U.S. National Science Foundation [CRN2047, GEO-0452325]","Consejo National de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Argentina; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) - U.S. National Science Foundation","We are grateful for support from Consejo National de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET; PIP 112-2011010-0809), Argentina, the Australian Research Council (ARC DP120104320), and the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) CRN2047 which is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant GEO-0452325).

The wall of the pore can be corrugated, melted and solidified, or remain the same shape depending on the pore filled or partially filled with gases or water. By accounting for unsteady mass, momentum, energy and species transport, and physico-chemical equilibrium on the cap surface, the predicted results show agreement with the measured locations of the solidification front, cap radii and shapes of the pore. The shape of the pore is strongly affected by solidification rate. In earlier stage of solidification, rapid freezing enhances mass transfer and gas pressure in the pore. The growth of cap radius is attributed to the decreasing rate of gas pressure overriding that of hydrostatic pressure on the cap. An oscillating interface fluctuates mass transfer and gas pressure. As the decreasing rate of gas pressure becomes the same order of that of hydrostatic pressure in later time, the wall of the pore readily corrugates.","Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan","National Sun Yat Sen University","Chiu, SH (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.","","","","","","",NA,"24","0","0","0","0","ORGANIZACIJE ENKRATNI ZALOZNISKO","LJUBLJANA","LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA","","","961-6353-26-8","","","","2000",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"167","174","","","","","","8","Thermodynamics; Engineering, Mechanical","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Thermodynamics; Engineering","BQ99T",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000165310800021","View Full Record in Web of Science"

As a result, communities with many regionally rare and endangered species are vanishing. We examined to what extend changes in the cover of sociological species groups and plant functional types in an unmanaged grassland depend on fluctuations in climatic conditions. Vegetation data from permanent plots in an abandoned grassland in southern Poland collected over 12 years were used. Relations between weather variables, time, and the cover of species groups were analysed using multiple linear regression and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The climatic data included mean temperatures and precipitation sums for each month from January to December (for the current year from January to July), and for 2, 3 and 4 consecutive months, with time lags of 0, 1, 2 and 3 years. It was found that both inter-annual fluctuation of climatic conditions and successional processes considerably influenced species composition of the study grassland. The fluctuations in precipitation and temperature explained from 0.8% to 27.1% of the variation in the cover of various sociological groups. The greatest effect on the cover dynamics of all species and majority of sociological groups had precipitation in spring and early summer in the current year. Most of species groups were affected also by temperature in spring and/or summer in the previous years, but its effect was lower than precipitation. The obtained results suggest that climatic conditions have also a significant impact on the rate of changes in abandoned limestone grasslands. Higher precipitation in spring and summer favour growth and spread of tall meadow grasses and forbs, accelerating changes from less compact communities dominated by smaller xerothermic species to more compact vegetation with a closed structure. In consequence the role of xerothermic calcareous species decreases and many of them may locally extinct within decades.","[Dzwonko, Zbigniew; Loster, Stefania] Jagellonian Univ, Inst Bot, PL-31512 Krakow, Poland","Jagiellonian University","Dzwonko, Z (corresponding author), Jagellonian Univ, Inst Bot, Lubicz St 46, PL-31512 Krakow, Poland.","ubdzwonk@cyf-kr.edu.pl","","","","","",NA,"28","3","3","0","13","POLISH ACAD SCIENCES INST ECOLOGY","LOMIANKI","DZIEKANOW LESNY NEAR WARSAW, 05-092 LOMIANKI, POLAND","1505-2249","","","POL J ECOL","Pol.

To construct the life expectancy table and fecundity, daily observations were made of 70 nymphs at each temperature, from birth to death. Development of R. path was faster with increased temperature, but they did not complete the last nymphal instar at 32 degrees C. The same pattern occurred for the pre-reproductive, reproductive, and post-reproductive periods. The highest fecundity rates were between 16 degrees C and 24 degrees C.

However, the seasonal fluctuation of some photosynthesis parameters (e. g. the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (V-cmax), the maximum electron transport rate (J(max)) and internal mesophyll conductance to CO2 transport (gm)) is not considered in the FvCB model. In this study, we investigated the patterns of the FvCB parameters during flag leaf development based on measured photosynthesis-intercellular CO2 curves in two cultivars of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Parameterised seasonal patterns of photosynthesis parameters in the FvCB model have subsequently been applied in order to predict the photosynthesis of flag leaves. The results indicate that the Gaussian curve characterises the dynamic patterns of V-cmax, J(max) and g(m) well. Compared with the model with fixed photosynthesis parameter values, updating the FvCB model by considering seasonal changes in V-cmax and J(max) during flag leaf development slightly improved predictions of photosynthesis. However, if the updated FvCB model incorporated the seasonal patterns of V-cmax and J(max), and also of g(m), predictions of photosynthesis was improved a lot, matching well with the measurements (R-2 = 0.87, P < 0.0001).

In its natural habitat, S. hexandrum is exposed to a multitude of adversities, such as fluctuating temperatures, water deficit, and high UV radiations. Transcriptional regulation of genes, which is regulated by the condition-specific binding of transcriptional factors to precise motifs in the promoter region, underlines responses to an environmental cue. Therefore, analysis of promoter sequences could ascertain the spatio-temporal expression of genes and overall stress responses. Unavailability of genomic information does not permit such analysis in S. hexandrum, especially on regulation of PTOX pathway. Accordingly, this study describes isolation and in silico analysis of 5 '-upstream regions of ShPLR (PINORESINOL-LARICIRESINOL REDUCTASE) and ShSLD (SECOISOLARICIRESINOL DEHYDROGENASE), the two key genes of the PTOX biosynthetic pathway. Data showed a range of motifs related to basal transcription, stress-responsive elements, such as those for drought, low temperature, and light, suggesting that the expression of these genes and resulting PTOX accumulation would be affected by, at least, these environmental cues. While the impact of temperature and light on PTOX accumulation is well studied, the effect of water deficit on the physiology of S. hexandrum and PTOX accumulation remains obscure. Given the presence of drought-responsive elements in the promoters of the key genes, the impact of water deficit on growth and development and PTOX accumulation was studied. The results showed decline in relative water content and net photosynthetic rate, and increase in relative electrolyte leakage with stress progression. Plants under stress exhibited a reduction in transpiration rate and chlorophyll content, with a gradual increase in osmoprotectant content. Besides, stressed plants showed an increase in the expression of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway and PTOX biosynthesis, and an increase in PTOX accumulation. Upon re-watering, non-irrigated plants showed a significant improvement in biochemical and physiological parameters. Summarily, our results demonstrated the importance of osmoprotectants during water deficit and the revival capacity of the species from water deficit, wherein PTOX synthesis was also modulated. Moreover, isolated promoter sequences could be employed in genetic transformation to mediate the expression of stress-induced genes in other plant systems.","[Kumari, Anita; Dogra, Vivek; Joshi, Rohit; Kumar, Sanjay] CSIR Inst Himalayan Bioresource Technol, Biotechnol Div, Palampur, Himachal Prades, India; [Kumari, Anita; Dogra, Vivek; Joshi, Rohit; Kumar, Sanjay] Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad, India","Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT); Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR)","Kumar, S (corresponding author), CSIR Inst Himalayan Bioresource Technol, Biotechnol Div, Palampur, Himachal Prades, India.;Kumar, S (corresponding author), Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad, India.","sanjayplp1@gmail.com","","","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India [NWP-008, 0109, 0107]; Ramalingaswami Re-entry Fellowship, Department of Biotechnology, Government of India [BT/RLF/Reentry/02/2019]","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India(Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India); Ramalingaswami Re-entry Fellowship, Department of Biotechnology, Government of India","This study was supported by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India, through the projects entitled Pathway engineering and system biology approach toward homologous and heterologous expression of high-value phytoceuticals (artemisinin, picrosides, morphine, withanolides, podophyllotoxin (NWP-008), Plant diversity: studying adaptation biology and understanding/exploiting medicinally important plants for useful bioactives (SIMPLE-BSC, 0109), and Genomics of medicinal plants and agronomically important traits (PlaGen-BSC, 0107).

Since we thought changes in the carbohydrate status could cause this pattern through feedback from starch and sucrose synthesis, we studied the natural fluctuations in photosynthesis rates of plants grown at 36 and 56 Pa CO2 at a FACE (free-air-CO2-enrichment) research site. Light-saturated photosynthesis varied by 40% during the day and was independent of the light-limited quantum yield of photosynthesis, which varied little through the day. Photosynthesis did not correspond with xylem water potential or leaf carbohydrate build-up, but rather with diurnal changes in air vapor-pressure deficit and light. The afternoon decline in photosynthesis also corresponded with decreased stomatal conductance and decreased Rubisco carboxylation efficiency which in turn allowed leaf-airspace CO2 partial pressure to remain constant. Growth at elevated CO2 did not affect the afternoon decline in photosynthesis, but did stimulate early-morning photosynthesis rates relative to the rest of the day. Plants grown at 56 Pa CO2 had higher light-limited quantum yields than those at 36 Pa CO2 but, there was no growth-CO2 effect on quantum yield when measured at 2 kPa O-2. Therefore, understory plants have a high light-limited quantum yield that does not vary through the day. Thus, the major diurnal changes in photosynthesis occur under light-saturated conditions which may help understory saplings maximize their sunfleck-use-efficiency.","Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; USDA ARS, Photosynthesis Res Unit, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","Singsaas, EL (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.","","","Singsaas, Eric/0000-0001-6874-7336","","","",NA,"45","43","49","4","43","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA","0028-646X","","","NEW PHYTOL","New Phytol.","JAN","2000","145","1","",NA,"",NA,"39","49","","10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00556.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00556.x","","","11","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","280RW",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000085116800006","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Under climate change, wetlands plant community productivity and diversity may be affected. In previous studies of wetlands, the effects of climate change have been primarily investigated using field observations, factor-controlled experiments, and mechanism analyses. However, the ecological risks to wetland communities under potential long term climate change on a regional scale remain uncertain. The Sanjiang Plain is the largest area of natural marsh wetlands and the national ecological functions in China. In this study, the changes in plant productivity and diversity of wetland ecosystems in the Sanjiang Plain were simulated under different climate change scenarios (i. e., Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP 2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5), and the rank of spatiotemporal risk on a regional scale was estimated using a pressure-state-response model. Temperature and precipitation had average rates of increase of 0.44 degrees C/10a and 12.13 mm/10a, respectively, under different climate change scenarios to 2050. The fluctuation range in climatic factors was largest under the RCP8.5 scenario. On a long-term scale, compared with the base year of 2010, vegetation productivity increased significantly under the RCP2.6 scenario, remained almost constant under RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios, and decreased under the RCP8.5 scenario. In contrast to productivity, plant diversity increased under all four scenarios, but the range of increase gradually decreased with the increase in scenarios. Spatially, a fluctuation range change in precipitation was one of the important factors that caused high risks to regional wetlands. In the northwest of the Sanjiang Plain, most wetlands were assessed as high risk at level-3. In the other regions, the risks were lower with the values below level-2, and only a few places were assessed at risk level-3. In national wetland nature reserves, the northeast of the Qixing River, Xingkai Lake, and the Dongfanghong Marsh wetland area were ranked as high risk at level-3. These findings suggest that wetland protection and management should be focus on hydrological allocation and the potential ecological risks to national wetland nature reserves. However, a joint risk assessment of climate change and human activity should be conducted to provide a comprehensive reference for the protection and development of natural marsh wetlands.","[Fu, Jing; Wang, Xianwei; Zhang, Mengduo; Chen, Weiwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agro Ecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China; [Liu, Juan] Yunnan Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Bin] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Yunnan Agricultural University; Beijing Normal University","Chen, WW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agro Ecol, Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Environm, Changchun 130102, Peoples R China.;Chen, B (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.","chenweiwei@iga.ac.cn; chenb@bnu.edu.cn","Chen, Bin/A-6951-2012","Chen, Bin/0000-0002-5488-6850","National Key RAMP;D Program of China [2016YFA0602304]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDB-SSW-DQC045]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41775116]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences [2017275]; Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS [IGA-135-05]","National Key RAMP;D Program of China; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFA0602304), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences(No. QYZDB-SSW-DQC045), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41775116), and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. 2017275), Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS(No. IGA-135-05).",NA,"55","27","28","7","73","ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","LONDON","24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND","0301-4797","1095-8630","","J ENVIRON MANAGE","J.

As changing frequency is a key characteristic of fluctuating light, we speculated that rapid light fluctuation may induce rapid photosynthetic responses, which may protect leaves against photoinhibition. To test this hypothesis, maize seedlings were grown under fluctuating light with various frequencies (1, 10, and 100 cycles of fluctuations/10 h), and changes in growth, chlorophyll content, gas exchange, chlorophyllafluorescence, and P700 were analyzed carefully. Our data show that though the growth and light-saturated photosynthetic rate were depressed by rapidly fluctuating light, photosynthesis induction was clearly speeded up. Furthermore, more rapid fluctuation of light strikingly reduced the chlorophyll content, while thermal dissipation was triggered and enhanced. The chlorophyllafluorescence induction kinetics and P700 absorption results showed that the activities of both photosystem II and photosystem I decreased as the frequency of the fluctuating light increased. In all treatments, the light intensities of the fluctuating light were kept constant. Therefore, rapid light fluctuation frequency itself induced the acceleration of photosynthetic induction and the enhancement of photoprotection in maize seedlings, which play important roles in protecting photosynthetic apparatus against fluctuating high light to a certain extent.","[Qiao, Mei-Yu; Zhang, Ya-Jun; Liu, Li-An; Shi, Lei; Ma, Qing-Hu; Jiang, Chuang-Dao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Key Lab Plant Resources, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Mei-Yu; Zhang, Ya-Jun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chow, Wah Soon] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Plant Sci, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Australian National University","Jiang, CD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Key Lab Plant Resources, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.","jcdao@ibcas.ac.cn","","Jiang, Chuang-Dao/0000-0002-0744-3651","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31571576]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31571576).",NA,"31","17","17","8","47","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0166-8595","1573-5079","","PHOTOSYNTH RES","Photosynth.

Long-term productivity stability in plant communities is often associated with greater species, phylogenetic or functional diversity, more complex size and age structures, or higher asynchrony in species fluctuations (compensatory dynamics), all potentially increasing community resistance to perturbations. However, the relative importance of these stabilizing pathways is still poorly understood, especially in old-growth species-rich forests. Here we explore how compensatory dynamics and multiple facets of diversity underpin temporal stability of wood biomass production over forty years in a Japanese temperate forest, based on more than 45 500 stem increments from 15 species. Whereas the effect of species richness and phylogenetic diversity was small, the old-growth structural attributes markedly increased community stability via increased asynchrony in the performance of co-occurring species. Greater standing tree volume, stem density and interspecific variation in growth rates enhanced productivity stability both directly and indirectly via increased asynchrony. This corroborates the predictions of increased compensatory dynamics with increased asymmetric competition for light in a more productive environment. Asymmetric competition in old-growth patches, between dominant oaks and sub-canopy shade-tolerant firs and maples, is a major driver of productivity stability over time via compensatory dynamics. Overall productivity remains relatively constant in old-growth patches, as abundant firs and maples in the lower canopy layers compensate for biomass losses in canopy oaks caused by aging, wind and snow disturbances. Younger forest patches, composed of fast-growing, shade-intolerant species, had a lower stability of productivity, with reduced stem basal area and tree density due to higher understory bamboo coverage preventing tree regeneration and growth. We provide new insights into mechanisms underlying the stability of ecosystem functioning in diverse forest ecosystems, and emphasize the importance of preserving and supporting old-growth forests and their structural complexity.","[Dolezal, Jiri; Fibich, Pavel; Altman, Jan] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic; [Dolezal, Jiri; Fibich, Pavel; Leps, Jan] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Uemura, Shigeru] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Forest Res Stn, Nayoro, Hokkaido, Japan; [Takahashi, Koichi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Hara, Toshihiko] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan","Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Hokkaido University; Shinshu University; Hokkaido University","Dolezal, J (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, CZ-25243 Pruhonice, Czech Republic.;Dolezal, J (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.","jiriddolezal@gmail.com","Altman, Jan/B-4305-2015; Fibich, Pavel/B-3013-2015; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013","Fibich, Pavel/0000-0001-9066-3753; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Dolezal, Jiri/0000-0002-5829-4051","Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Czech Science Foundation [17-19376S, 17-07378S, 20-05840Y]; Czech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985939]; Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship","Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Czech Academy of Sciences(Czech Academy of Sciences); Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship","The study was funded by the Grant for Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University and by Czech Science Foundation (grants 17-19376S, 17-07378S and 20-05840Y), Czech Academy of Sciences (RVO 67985939) and Fulbright-Masaryk Fellowship.",NA,"65","16","16","19","126","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0030-1299","1600-0706","","OIKOS","Oikos","NOV","2020","129","11","",NA,"",NA,"1692","1703","","10.1111/oik.07379","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.07379","","AUG 2020","12","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","OM5SL",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000555270000001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, relatively little is known about homeothermic animals' ability to adapt to changing temperature regimes through changes in body size, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. We used fluctuations in mean annual temperatures in south-west Germany since 1972 in order to look for direct links between temperature and two aspects of body size: body mass and flight feather length. Data from regionally born juveniles of 12 passerine bird species were analysed. Body mass and feather length varied significantly among years in eight and nine species, respectively. Typically the inter-annual changes in morphology were complexly non-linear, as was inter-annual variation in temperature. For six (body mass) and seven species (feather length), these inter-annual fluctuations were significantly correlated with temperature fluctuations. However, negative correlations consistent with Bergmann's rule were only found for five species, either for body mass or feather length. In several of the species for which body mass and feather length was significantly associated with temperature, morphological responses were better predicted by temperature data that were smoothed across multiple years than by the actual mean breeding season temperatures of the year of birth. This was found in five species for body mass and three species for feather length. These results suggest that changes in body size may not merely be the result of phenotypic plasticity but may hint at genetically based microevolutionary adaptations.","[Salewski, Volker; Fiedler, Wolfgang] Max Planck Inst Ornithol, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany; [Hochachka, Wesley M.] Cornell Univ, Ornithol Lab, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA","Max Planck Society; Cornell University","Salewski, V (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Ornithol, Schlossallee 2, D-78315 Radolfzell am Bodensee, Germany.","salewski@orn.mpg.de; wmh6@cornell.edu","Pannecouque, Christophe/C-2793-2018; Fiedler, Wolfgang/AAG-4510-2021; Hochachka, Wesley M./J-9768-2012; Rawal, Ravindra/F-9486-2010","Pannecouque, Christophe/0000-0002-1254-4473; Fiedler, Wolfgang/0000-0003-1082-4161; Hochachka, Wesley M./0000-0002-0595-7827; Rawal, Ravindra/0000-0001-9035-3579","","","",NA,"88","49","54","0","50","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0029-8549","1432-1939","","OECOLOGIA","Oecologia","JAN","2010","162","1","",NA,"",NA,"247","260","","10.1007/s00442-009-1446-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1446-2","","","14","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","518ZZ","19722109","Green Published, hybrid","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000271736100023","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The objectives of the present study were to examine the effect of the geometry of a growth container with a given volume and irrigation frequency, on water content and temperature of the growing medium and on water uptake, yield and quality of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) as a model plant. Two experiments, in the spring and fall, were conducted in a greenhouse. Plants were grown in a volume of 4 L per plant of medium mixture of 0-8 mm tuff (90 %) with compost (10 %). Treatments included three container heights (10, 20 and 30 cm) and two irrigation frequencies (4-6 and 12-18 applications per day and 2 night applications for both). Lettuce head fresh weight was lower in the spring than in the fall and was not significantly affected by container geometry or irrigation frequency. However, the number of tip burn damaged leaves per plant increased significantly with container height, especially for the high irrigation frequency treatments. Container geometry had an effect on the water and temperature regimes.

The model tracks changes in the above- and below-ground biomass and shoot density and is based on data for Zostera biomass, net production and growth rates, chemical-physical parameters and nutrient concentrations in water, sediment and particulate matter. It was assumed that the most important factors controlling Zostera growth and distribution are light and temperature, and that Zostera growth was not limited by nutrient availability. The goal was to simulate biomass production and its seasonal changes as a function of external forcing variables (light, water temperature, wind and tide-generated water movements) and internal control (plant density). A series of simulation experiments were performed with the basic model and its modifications showed that among the most important phenomena affecting Zostera growth are: (1) inhibition of production and recruitment of new shoots by high temperature and (2) light attenuation due to seasonal fluctuation and wind- and tide-induced suspension of sediments.

The overall decline in E. coli O157:H7 was primarily determined by competition with autochthonous copiotrophic bacteria simulated by an inter-specific competition term according to Lotka-Volterra. Oscillations of bacterial populations were attained by the relationships between relative growth and death rates with readily available substrate content. The model contains a logistic and exponential relation of relative growth and death rates, respectively, of E. coli O157:H7 and copiotrophic bacteria with temperature, resulting in optimum curves for net growth rates similar to the curves reported in the literature. The model has been both calibrated and validated on experimental data. The model was used to perform sensitivity analysis and to evaluate different manure and soil management scenarios in terms of survival of E. coli O157:H7. The relative effects of changes in temperature on simulated survival time of E. coli O157:H7 were more pronounced than changes in oxygen condition. Testing manure storage scenarios with realistic data revealed that manure stored in a heap that was turned every week resulted in almost 70% reduction of E. coli O157:H7 survival compared to unturned manure. At the surface of a heap with unturned manure, simulated survival time was the longest (2.4 times longer than inside the same heap). The simulation model provides a new approach to investigating dynamic changes of invasive microorganisms in natural substrates such as manure or manure-amended soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The quality of extracts or preparations is difficult to control because of the unstable raw materials. The aim of this study is to enhance the yield and medicinal component contents of H. perforatum by optimizing lighting factors under controlled environment. H. perforatum plants were hydroponically cultivated for 30 d under 3 levels of photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) with 200, 300, and 400 mu mol/(m2 center dot s) using white LEDs (R:B ratio is the ratio of red light to blue light, R:B ratio of 0.9 and 1.8) and white plus red LED (R:B ratio of 2.7). The results showed that PPFD and LED spectrum had significant effects on the growth and accumulation of medicinal components of H. perforatum. Biomass accumulation of stem, leaf, and root increased linearly with the increase of PPFD under each LED spectrum. Fresh weights and dry weights of stem, leaf, and root were significantly higher under a PPFD of 400 mu mol/(m2 center dot s) with R:B ratio of 0.9 than those of 200 mu mol/(m2 center dot s), respectively. The relative growth rate and net photosynthetic rate showed linear relationships with PPFD under the same LED spectrum. Total hypericin content, total hyperforin content, and energy yield of hypericin increased with increasing PPFD. Total hypericin content and energy yield of hypericin of P400-L0.9 were 78% and 89% more than those of P400-L2.7, respectively. Total hyperforin content and energy yield of hyperforin of P400-L0.9 and P400-L2.7 were no significant differences. Based on energy efficiency, an R:B ratio of 0.9 of white LEDs with a PPFD of 400 mu mol/(m2 center dot s) was beneficial to improve medicinal component contents of hydroponic H. perforatum in plant factory with LED lighting.","[Gao, Wei; He, Dongxian; Zheng, Jianfeng] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Gao, Wei; He, Dongxian; Zheng, Jianfeng] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Agr Engn Struct & Environm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan] Kunming Da Cun Scitech Co Ltd, Kunming 650000, Peoples R China; [He, Dongxian] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Plant Environm physiol & plant factory technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","China Agricultural University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; China Agricultural University","He, DX (corresponding author), Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Agr Engn Struct & Environm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;He, DX (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Plant Environm physiol & plant factory technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.","gw89@foxmail.com; hedx@cau.edu.cn; zjf@cau.edu.cn; 13888892809@163.com","","","China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA;  [CARS -21]","China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA(Ministry of Oceans & Fisheries (MOF), Republic of Korea); ","This work was supported by China Agriculture Research System of MOF and MARA (CARS -21) .

In fact, the physics of a self-heated thermonuclear plasma due to fusion-born 3.5 MeV alpha-particles is one of the most important outstanding fundamental research topics on the way to a fusion power plant with magnetic confinement. Within the last 10 years significant advances on both the theoretical and the experimental sides have been made leading to a more detailed and quantitative understanding of fast-particle-driven instabilities. On the theoretical side, the crucial step was to move from fluid models for the plasma background with a hybrid kinetic expression for the energetic particles to a fully kinetic model for all the plasma species, i.e. background ions, background electrons, and fast ions. This improvement allows one to describe consistently the resonant interaction between global plasma waves such as shear Alfven and Alfven-acoustic waves, and the particles via Landau damping, i.e. the dynamics parallel to the magnetic background field. Also, mode conversion mechanisms require the inclusion of background ion scales in a kinetic, non-perturbative way. This accurate treatment of the plasma background leads not only to changes in the linear mode properties such as frequency, growth/damping rate, and mode structure but also influences the non-linear dynamics. Due to major advances, innovations and installation of diagnostics in present day experiments, this comparison can be carried out in a more detailed and comprehensive way than a few years ago. For example, the measurement of damping rates via active external antennas, the imaging of 2D mode structures via electron cyclotron-emission spectroscopy, and the direct detection of escaping fast ions allow to diagnose various kinetic features of the plasma modes that are responsible for the transport of energetic particles. Furthermore, the fast particle distribution function itself can also be measured with much greater confidence. Therefore, the new physics accessible due to a more comprehensive model and numerical implementation can be directly verified and validated with experimental data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the removal rate of ammoniacal nitrogen from the wastewater still requires alternative technology as compared with the self-purification method. This provides a platform for further investigation of the degradation of nitrogen. Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria have been found to provide a shorter pathway for degradation of nitrogen in wastewater with limited presence of oxygen. The temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate concentrations were analysed for the samples collected from the local WWTP. Influence of the various Malaysia weather conditions upon the treatment process was also observed. The temperature was found to fluctuate between 29.6 degrees C and 32.0 degrees C throughout the experiments at commemorating pH values of between 5.78 and 7.22 and DO concentration of 0.62-1.53 mg/L. Molecular analyses including genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction, polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing were conducted to identify the presence of anammox bacteria. The gDNA of the sludge from anoxic and sequencing batch reactor tanks were successfully extracted with the gDNA amount of 24.40 and 31.67 mu g, respectively. Anammox bacteria namely Kuenenia stuttgartiensis was found in the selected wastewater samples from the local WWTP.

Proton gradient regulation 5 (PGR5) is a major component of the cyclic electron flow pathway, and the Arabidopsis pgr5 mutant shows a substantial reduction in the PMF. How the PGR5-dependent cyclic electron flow contributes to ATP synthesis has not, however, been fully delineated. In this study, we monitored in vivo ATP levels in Arabidopsis chloroplasts in real time using a genetically encoded bioluminescence-based ATP indicator, Nano-lantern(ATP1). The increase in ATP in the chloroplast stroma of pgr5 leaves upon illumination with actinic light was significantly slower than in wild type, and the decrease in ATP levels when this illumination stopped was significantly faster in pgr5 leaves than in wild type. These results indicated that PGR5-dependent cyclic electron flow around photosystem I helps to sustain the rate of ATP synthesis, which is important for growth under fluctuating light conditions.","[Sato, Ryoichi; Kawashima, Rinya; Mai Duy Luu Trinh] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Life Sci & Technol, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; [Nakano, Masahiro; Nagai, Takeharu] Osaka Univ, Inst Sci & Ind Res, Osaka 5670047, Japan; [Masuda, Shinji] Tokyo Inst Technol, Ctr Biol Resources & Informat, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan; [Sato, Ryoichi] Natl Inst Basic Biol, Div Environm Photobiol, Okazaki, Aichi 4448585, Japan","Tokyo Institute of Technology; Osaka University; Tokyo Institute of Technology; National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) - Japan; National Institute for Basic Biology (NIBB)","Masuda, S (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Ctr Biol Resources & Informat, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2268501, Japan.","shmasuda@bio.titech.ac.jp","Masuda, Shinji/A-2703-2014; Sato, Ryoichi/AAG-1658-2020","Masuda, Shinji/0000-0002-5349-4927; Trinh, Mai Duy Luu/0000-0002-3428-3657; Nagai, Takeharu/0000-0003-2650-9895","","","",NA,"35","4","4","5","29","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0166-8595","1573-5079","","PHOTOSYNTH RES","Photosynth.

Increased foliage temperature (2.5 degrees C above fluctuating ambient) was induced by heating the stand with infrared radiation sources, modulated by an electronic control device (FATI, Free Air Temperature Increase). Enhanced CO2 was produced by a FACE system (Free Air CO2 Enrichment). Exposure to simulated climate warming drastically reduced above-ground harvestable dry matter (52% loss). The nitrogen allocated to the leaf fraction was thus concentrated into less dry matter, which enhanced the nitrogen concentration on a mass basis (+17%) but also per unit leaf area (+47%). As a consequence, CO, assimilation rates were not affected in these slower growing plants in the +2.5 degrees C treatment, and the photochemical efficiency of non-cyclic electron transport of photosystem II was also unaffected. Although the plants were grown in the field without root restrictions, long-term exposure to elevated CO, concentration induced noticeable acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus (40% loss of fixation potential), which largely outweighed the direct stimulation in this summer period. Part of the reduced rates could be attributed to lower N concentration on a leaf area basis. The results are compared with responses of this species in sunlit conditioned greenhouses, which indicates that experiments in enclosures may underestimate effects in the field. This also emphasizes the need to validate other plant responses to climate warming and CO2 enrichment in free air conditions.","ETH ZURICH,INST PLANT SCI,CH-8092 ZURICH,SWITZERLAND; BROOKHAVEN NATL LAB,UPTON,NY 11973","Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Brookhaven National Laboratory","Nijs, I (corresponding author), UNIV INSTELLING ANTWERP,DEPT BIOL,LAB PLANT ECOL,UNIV PL 1,B-2610 WILRIJK,BELGIUM.","","","Nijs, Ivan/0000-0003-3111-680X","","","",NA,"22","44","51","0","18","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD, ENGLAND OX5 1GB","0098-8472","","","ENVIRON EXP BOT","Environ.

Its origins are debatable, but the effects on ice recession, water availability, and summer growth conditions are demonstrable. Light-dependent, temperature-sensitive, fast-growing organisms respond to these physical and biogeographical changes. Microalgae (cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae), which are pioneer colonists of Antarctic mineral fellfield soils, are therefore highly suitable biological indicators of such changes. In frost-heaved soil polygons containing naturally sorted fine mineral particles, microalgal growth is restricted to a shallow zone of light penetration. By virtue of this light requirement, microalgae are exposed to extreme seasonal fluctuations in temperature (air and black-body radiation), photosynthetically active radiation, UV radiation, and desiccation. Dominance of conspicuous autofluorescent indicator species with distinctive morphology allowed quantification of responses using epifluorescence microscopy, and image analysis of undisturbed, unstained communities. However, the physical changes in climate, although significant in the long term, are gradual. The changes were therefore amplified experimentally by enclosing the communities at a fellfield site on Signy Island, maritime Antarctica, in cloches (small greenhouses). These were made of polystyrene of either UV-transparent or UV-opaque acrylic plastic, with or without walls. During a 6-year period, statistically significant changes were observed in microalgal colonization of the soil surface and in the morphology of filamentous populations. Evidence of community succession correlated with measured changes in local environment was found. Results from Signy Island and at continental sites on Alexander Island suggested that rates of microalgal colonization and community development might change significantly during current climate changes in Antarctica.","","","WynnWilliams, DD (corresponding author), BRITISH ANTARCTIC SURVEY,NERC,HIGH CROSS,MADINGLEY RD,CAMBRIDGE CB3 0ET,ENGLAND.","","","","","","",NA,"29","52","53","0","13","SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010","0095-3628","","","MICROBIAL ECOL","Microb.

In this study, we used phenology observations at 67 stations from 1981 to 2014 to detect trends in actual sowing dates, then the agricultural production systems simulator, APSIM-Maize model, was used to assess the effects of changes in observed sowing dates on maize phenology and yields. During the past 34-year period, the actual maize sowing dates show a delaying tendency, at a rate of 1-6 days per decade, but there are significant fluctuations among years. For per day delay in the sowing dates, the whole growing season was shortened by 0.1%. Delaying sowing dates reduced the solar radiation interception during the vegetative period as well as the thermal time during the reproductive period. As a result, the overall maize potential yield was negatively affected in NEC; for per day delay in the sowing dates, the potential yield was decreased by 0.6%. By contrast, advancing sowing dates in some years led to increases in both the solar radiation interception during the vegetative period and the thermal time during the reproductive period. However, these increases showed various effects on the maize potential yield across different parts of the study region. We detected a positive effect of advancing sowing dates on maize potential yield in the high latitudes, at a rate of up to 1.6%.

Compared to photosynthesis, the physiology, environmental control and ecological importance of processes involving C release from trees have been less studied; it is the purpose of this review to address these questions in oak trees with special focus on R and VOC emissions. Mass-based leaf dark R scales positively with specific leaf area, nitrogen content and photosynthetic capacity, and it is normally greater in deciduous species than evergreen sclerophyllous ones. Leaf dark R increases with temperature, and is constrained by water shortages; however, the magnitude of these responses may vary at different temporal scales. Similarly, R in woody tissues increases with temperature, although in a hysteretic manner during a diel period. On a seasonal basis, besides temperature, water availability becomes the main abiotic driver of woody tissue R as drought stress down-regulates maintenance and growth metabolic processes in stems and roots. Respiration in foliar and woody tissues is expected to account for about half of photosynthesis; nevertheless, R can largely fluctuate with ontogenetic, biotic and abiotic factors independently of C uptake. Volatile organic compounds have multiple roles in plant-environment interactions and plant-plant signalling. Oak genus is one of the strongest emitter of isoprenoids, which are the most important VOCs released from plants. Most oak species release isoprene constitutively; however, several oak species distributed around the Mediterranean (mostly evergreen) do not produce isoprene, but alternatively emit monoterpenes or lack constitutive emissions of VOCs. The rate of emission of VOCs from leaves increases with leaf temperature and irradiance, being the derived C loss relative to photosynthesis about 1%, except during heat waves when this percentage may increase up to 5%. Emission of VOCs is constrained by drought-stress to a lesser extent than leaf photosynthesis, thus the relative C loss through VOCs also increases with drought severity. Overall, the hypothesis of homeostatic ratios between plant C gain and C loss, an artefact of our better understanding of photosynthesis in comparison to all these processes that encompass tree C loss, should be revisited to better understand C cycling in oaks and to better predict oak physiological performance under climate change scenarios.","[Salomon, Roberto L.] Univ Ghent, Plant Ecol Lab, Dept Appl Ecol & Environm Biol, Fac Biosci Engn, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Salomon, Roberto L.; Rodriguez-Calcerrada, Jesus] Tech Univ Madrid, ETS Forestry Engn, Forest Genet & Ecophysiol Res Grp, Ciudad Univ S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Staudt, Michael] CNRS, Ctr Ecol Fonct & Evolut CEFE, UMR 5175, 1919 Route Mende, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France","Ghent University; Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; UDICE-French Research Universities; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; CIRAD; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite Paul-Valery; Universite de Montpellier","Salomon, RL (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Plant Ecol Lab, Dept Appl Ecol & Environm Biol, Fac Biosci Engn, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.","RobertoLuis.SalomonMoreno@UGent.be","Staudt, Michael/S-2220-2016; Rodríguez-Calcerrada, Jesús/P-6716-2014; Salomón, Roberto L./E-8530-2010","Staudt, Michael/0000-0001-8694-507X; Rodríguez-Calcerrada, Jesús/0000-0001-7408-7653; Salomón, Roberto L./0000-0003-2674-1731","","","",NA,"185","11","11","0","16","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","1568-2544","","978-3-319-69099-5; 978-3-319-69098-8","TREE PHYSIOL-NETH","","","2017","7","","",NA,"",NA,"327","359","","10.1007/978-3-319-69099-5_10","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-69099-5_10","10.1007/978-3-319-69099-5","","33","Plant Sciences; Ecology","Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)","Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","BL0MK",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000446167600010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These wetlands were altered, from estuarine to freshwater habitats, by flood mitigation activities initiated during the 1970s. Tidal restoration to approximately 300 hectares of the marsh is planned to occur by 2008, with the goal to reduce freshwater vegetation in favor of salt marsh species. We determined if timing restoration projects to coincide with natural germination cycles or seasonal conditions of high salinity would be disadvantageous to P. australis or J acutus germination. Germination trials lasted 25 days under two temperature range treatments (10-25 and 15-30 degrees C) and a salinity gradient (0-30 ppt). Many P. australis seeds commenced decomposition after three days (up to 58%). Increased salinity lowered germination in all species; however, only P. australis was influenced by temperature. Phragmites australis germinated in all conditions, although germination rate was low (2% +/- 1.7) in the highest salinity treatment at high temperature regime. Both Juncus species obtained 100% germination in freshwater, failed to germinate in the highest salinity, and seed viability was not affected by 25 days emersion in high salinity. For areas dominated by P. australis in eastern Australia, we suggest that tidal reinstatement should be initiated in late autumn when P. australis seed banks are low. Additionally, periods of heavy rainfall, which reduce soil salinity, may help other species colonize the area. Further studies are required to determine characteristics of J. acutus that can be used to repress the species spread along the eastern coast of Australia. Currently, active measures involving chemical and physical weed suppression, litter removal, and mass planting of native species, are likely to be required to achieve management goals.","Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia","University of Newcastle","Greenwood, ME (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Room LS 2-46,Biol, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.","mary.greenwood@studentmail.newcastle.edu","","MacFarlane, Geoff R./0000-0002-5090-6236","","","",NA,"40","51","60","2","65","SOC WETLAND SCIENTISTS","LAWRENCE","810 E TENTH ST, P O BOX 1897, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA","0277-5212","","","WETLANDS","Wetlands","SEP","2006","26","3","",NA,"",NA,"854","861","","10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[854:EOSATO]2.0.CO;2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[854:EOSATO]2.0.CO;2","","","8","Ecology; Environmental Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","093EG",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000241150000017","View Full Record in Web of Science"

These alterations are caused by more pronounced stratification due to rising temperatures, enhanced eutrophication, and browning of lakes. Community responses toward these effects can emerge as alterations in physiology, biomass, biochemical composition, or diversity. In this study, we addressed the combined effects of changes in light and nutrient conditions on community responses. In particular, we investigated how light intensity and variability under two nutrient conditions influence (1) fast responses such as adjustments in photosynthesis, (2) intermediate responses such as pigment adaptation and (3) slow responses such as changes in community biomass and species composition. Therefore, we exposed communities consisting of five phytoplankton species belonging to different taxonomic groups to two constant and two variable light intensity treatments combined with two levels of phosphorus supply. The tested phytoplankton communities exhibited increased fast reactions of photosynthetic processes to light variability and light intensity. The adjustment of their light harvesting mechanisms via community pigment composition was not affected by light intensity, variability, or nutrient supply. However, pigment specific effects of light intensity, light variability, and nutrient supply on the proportion of the respective pigments were detected. Biomass was positively affected by higher light intensity and nutrient concentrations while the direction of the effect of variability was modulated by light intensity. Light variability had a negative impact on biomass at low, but a positive impact at high light intensity. The effects on community composition were species specific. Generally, the proportion of green algae was higher under high light intensity, whereas the cyanobacterium performed better under low light conditions. In addition to that, the diatom and the cryptophyte performed better with high nutrient supply while the green algae as well as the cyanobacterium performed better at low nutrient conditions. This shows that light intensity, light variability, and nutrient supply interactively affect communities. Furthermore, the responses are highly species and pigment specific, thus to clarify the effects of climate change a deeper understanding of the effects of light variability and species interactions within communities is important.","[Marzetz, Vanessa; Spijkerman, Elly] Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Ecol & Ecosyst Modeling, Potsdam, Germany; [Marzetz, Vanessa; Wacker, Alexander] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Anim Ecol, Greifswald, Germany; [Striebel, Maren] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Inst Chem & Biol Marine Environm, Plankton Ecol, Wilhelmshaven, Germany","University of Potsdam; Ernst Moritz Arndt Universitat Greifswald; Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg","Marzetz, V (corresponding author), Univ Potsdam, Inst Biochem & Biol, Ecol & Ecosyst Modeling, Potsdam, Germany.;Marzetz, V (corresponding author), Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Anim Ecol, Greifswald, Germany.","marzetz@uni-potsdam.de","Striebel, Maren/AAF-9996-2019","Striebel, Maren/0000-0003-2061-2154","German Research Foundation [WA2445/10-1]; Open Access Publishing Fond of the University of Potsdam","German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Open Access Publishing Fond of the University of Potsdam","This study was supported by the German Research Foundation (WA2445/10-1) and the Open Access Publishing Fond of the University of Potsdam.",NA,"65","7","7","3","19","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-665X","","FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ","Front.

However, no simulation models are available to support the analysis of the impact of environmental conditions and management practices on hazelnut production. This paper presents two modelling solutions to simulate hazelnut tree growth and development under potential and water-limiting conditions, partly based on generic approaches used in tree modelling and on new modules specifically developed to address hazelnut tree peculiarities. The two solutions differed in the simulation of the photosynthetic rate, in one case reproduced using a Farquhar-type model (gross photosynthesis), whereas a radiation use efficiency approach (net photosynthesis) was used in the other. The coherence of simulation outputs at leaf, organ and plant level and the models responsiveness to weather conditions was verified and discussed with literature data, and the performances of the modelling solutions were evaluated using experimental data collected between 2002 and 2013 growing seasons in Piedmont region (northern Italy). Results highlighted the reliability of both the solutions in reproducing phenological development (mean relative root mean squared error, RRMSE = 8.61%), as well as the time trend of specific leaf area (RRMSE = 26.32%) and leaf area index (RRMSE = 18.46%). Also, the simulation of the temporal dynamics of soil water content and temperature along the soil profile led to outputs very close to observations (RRMSE = 14.02% and 10.32%, respectively). The solution based on gross photosynthesis resulted slightly more accurate in reproducing the year-to-year fluctuation in yields (RRMSE = 25.03%) compared to the one based on net photosynthesis (RRMSE = 30.40%).

In this study, two numerical models were used to explore T. democratica population dynamics. A Lefkovitch matrix model identified that the survival of juvenile oozoids was the most important population metric promoting population growth and a size-structured population model was developed to further explore the dynamics of T. democratica. The size-structured model tracks cohorts of four life stages and incorporates size-dependent reproduction and mortality. Model outputs of average generation time and mean abundances of each life stage corresponded well to previously reported values. Factors that promote juvenile oozoid abundance were the most sensitive parameters influencing salp abundance. A 10-year time-series simulation using this population model identified that salp abundances in the Tasman Sea are proportionally higher in winter and spring, consistent with previous studies. This model shows that temperature and phytoplankton concentration are sufficient drivers of large-scale patterns of salp abundance across season and latitude. These results demonstrate the importance of future research focusing on identifying the environmental conditions that influence the size at which females reproduce.","[Henschke, Natasha; Smith, James A.; Everett, Jason D.; Suthers, Iain M.] Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Henschke, Natasha; Smith, James A.; Everett, Jason D.; Suthers, Iain M.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia; [Henschke, Natasha] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia","University of New South Wales Sydney; Sydney Institute of Marine Science; University of New South Wales Sydney","Henschke, N (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.","n.henschke@unsw.edu.au","Everett, Jason D/C-4557-2008; Suthers, Iain M/C-4559-2008; Smith, James A/H-9155-2012","Everett, Jason D/0000-0002-6681-8054; Suthers, Iain M/0000-0002-9340-7461; Smith, James/0000-0002-0496-3221","University of New South Wales; Australian Research Council; Australian Government","University of New South Wales; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Government(Australian Government)","This project was funded by the University of New South Wales and the Australian Research Council.

Experiments conducted in Georgia from 2017 to 2018 evaluated cultivar by storage condition by sampling date effects on three peanut cultivars. The effects of varying environments, with respect to different temperatures and humidity, on peanut seed viability was evaluated when stored up to 72 d. Seed germination and vigor were assessed in petri dishes on a thermal gradient table with temperatures ranging from 10.2 to 33.2 degrees C and incubated for 7 d. Daily mean temperature data were used to calculate growing degree day (GDD) accumulation via thermocouples. Maximum germination rates (b0) and GDD values at 80% germination (Germ80) were quantified. Results indicated that germination and vigor varied by cultivar, storage environment, and sampling date with respect to GDDs required to reach Germ80 and maximum germination (b0). Storage environment treatments consisted of (a) 9-12 degrees C and 43-51% relative humidity (RH), (b) 18-27 degrees C and 42-54% RH, (c) 12-37 degrees C and 48-74% RH, and (d) 24-46 degrees C and 33-85% RH. Storage environments affected seed germination, where environments with large fluctuations in temperature and RH (12-37 degrees C, 48-74% RH and 24-46 degrees C, 33-85% RH) for up to 72 d resulted in decreased percentage germination (>20 points) and vigor (>5 GDDs). However, excellent seed germinationand vigor were sustained where storage temperatures were below 18 degrees C and RH was below 54%. Therefore, maintaining proper temperatures and RH is key to sustaining seed quality (germination and vigor) over time.","[Weaver, Caleb C.; Monfort, W.

Yet, studies addressing the evolutionary responses of phytoplankton in changing environments often lack an explicit element of biotic interactions. Here, we ask (1) how the presence of a locally adapted phytoplankton species will affect an invading phytoplankton species' evolutionary response to a physiologically challenging environment; (2) whether this response is conserved across environments varying in quality; and (3) which traits are associated with being a successful invader under climate change scenarios. In a conceptual first step to disentangle these broad questions, we experimentally evolved populations of fresh- and seawater phytoplankton in a novel salinity (the freshwater green algae Chlamydomonas in salt water, and the marine Ostreococcus in freshwater), either as mono-cultures (colonizers) or as co-cultures (invaders: invading a novel salinity occupied by a resident species, for example, Chlamydomonas invading salt water occupied by resident Ostreococcus) for 200 generations. We superimposed a temperature treatment (control (22 degrees C), mild warming (26 degrees C), drastic warming (32 degrees C), and fluctuating (22 degrees C/32 degrees C) warming) as a representative aspect of climate change with the potential to ameliorate or deteriorate existing environmental conditions. Invaders had systematically lower extinction rates and evolved overall higher growth rates, as well as broader salinity and temperature preferences than colonizers. The invading species' evolutionary responses differed from those of colonizers in a replicable way across environments of differing quality. The evolution of small cell size and high reactive oxygen species tolerance may explain the invaders' higher fitness under the scenarios tested here.","[Lachapelle, Josianne] Univ Toronto Mississauga, Dept Biol, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Bestion, Elvire] CNRS, Stn Ecol Theor & Expt, UAR 2029, Moulis, France; [Bestion, Elvire; Jackson, Eleanor E.; Schaum, C.

Leaf development was partitioned into seven arbitrary development stages; the time needed for leaves to progress through each developmental stage was used to measure days required to reach maturity. Measurements were made twice each week throughout 1997. Means and variances within emergence rates of new leaves and time needed for new leaves to pass through six leaf development stages were calculated for 26 14-day periods throughout the year and compared with degree days, solar radiation, soil temperature, and daylight hours accumulated during the periods. Leaf production rates ranged from 0.15-0.73 leaves day(-1) plant(-1). The average time from emergence to maturity was 22.6 days. Both leaf production and development rates varied greatly with the seasons, and were strongly associated with the weather variables measured, but significant cyclic rate fluctuations unrelated to weather were also detected. Leaf emergence rates were more strongly related to average soil temperature, whereas leaf development rates to maturity were more strongly related to solar radiation and degree days.","Univ Florida, Mid Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Dept Plant Pathol, Apopka, FL 32703 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Strandberg, JO (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Mid Florida Res & Educ Ctr, Dept Plant Pathol, 2725 Bin Rd, Apopka, FL 32703 USA.","jos@mail.ifas.ufl.edu","","","","","",NA,"29","9","9","0","2","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0003-4746","1744-7348","","ANN APPL BIOL","Ann.

To determine whether cells expressing these genes are specified to follow particular developmental fates, we have studied the pattern of cell lineages in developing flowers of Antirrhinum. Each flower has four whorls of organs, and progenitor cells of these can be marked at particular stages of development using a temperature-sensitive transposon. This allows the cell lineages in the newer to be followed, as well as giving information about rates of cell division. Results: We show here that, prior to the emergence of organ primordia, cells in the floral meristem have not been allocated organ identities. After this time, lineage restrictions arise between whorls, correlating with the onset of expression of genes that control organ identity. A further lineage restriction appears slightly later on, between the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the petal. Our results further suggest that the rates of cell division fluctuate during key stages of meristem development, perhaps as a consequence of meristem-identity gene expression. Conclusions: The patterns of lineage restriction and organ-identity gene expression in early floral meristems are consistent with some cells being allocated specific identities at about this stage of development. Plant cells cannot move relative to each other, so lineage restrictions in plants may reflect particular orientations and/or rates of growth at boundary regions.","JOHN INNES CTR PLANT SCI RES,DEPT GENET,NORWICH NR4 7UH,NORFOLK,ENGLAND","UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); John Innes Center","","","","","","","",NA,"44","43","44","0","5","CURRENT BIOLOGY LTD","LONDON","34-42 CLEVELAND STREET, LONDON, ENGLAND W1P 6LB","0960-9822","","","CURR BIOL","Curr.

A > 3-fold increase in monomethylmercury (MMHg) was observed in zooplankton (4.3 +/- 0.7 ng g(-1)) relative to phytoplankton (< 1.5 ng g(-1)), even though concentrations of THg in zooplankton (150-mu m mesh) were not significantly different than in phytoplankton. Concentrations and % MMHg increased with trophic level (IL) by > 150-fold and from < 10 to > 85%, respectively, from phytoplankton to muscle in the whelk Plicifusus kroeyeri (279 ng g(-1), TL 4.5).

No significant differences in TMS were found for the NECS plus three other studies from the eastern Canadian Arctic (average TMS = 0.24 +/- 0.02). Nevertheless, all data for MMHg in biota from the NECS plotted below the combined best fit line for all four studies. Results from an ANCOVA showed that statistically different (p = 0.001) intercept values (b), not TMS, best explained the > 2-fold lower concentrations of MMHg in biota from the NECS (b = -1.85) relative to the same species from the eastern Canadian Arctic (6 = -1.29). Future changes that affect bioaccumulation of MMHg in the Arctic may impact the biomagnification equation by shifting the TMS, intercept or both. The intercept is more likely to respond to changes in productivity and concentrations of dissolved Hg whereas the TMS may respond to changing growth rates due to fluctuations in productivity and food availability. In either case, small changes in the intercept or TMS coincide with predictably large increases or decreases in MMHg concentrations in apex predators.","[Fox, Austin L.; Trefry, John H.; Trocine, Robert P.] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Marine & Environm Syst, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Dunton, Kenneth H.] Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Lasorsa, Brenda K.] Battelle Marine Sci Lab, Sequim, WA 98382 USA; [Konar, Brenda] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Sch Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Ashjian, Carin J.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Cooper, Lee W.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Environm Sci, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Solomons, MD 20688 USA","Florida Institute of Technology; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science","Fox, AL (corresponding author), Florida Inst Technol, Dept Marine & Environm Syst, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA.","afox@fit.edu","Cooper, Lee W./E-5251-2012","Cooper, Lee W./0000-0001-7734-8388; Fox, Austin/0000-0003-0684-0425","Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), U.S. Department of Interior; U.S. Department of the Interior, BOEM, Alaska Outer Continental Shelf Region, Anchorage, Alaska as part of the Hanna Shoal Ecosystem Project [M11AC00007]; BOEM Alaska Environmental Studies Program; North Pacific Research Board, Project [A01/T2201-T2207]; Pacific Marine Arctic Regional Synthesis (PacMARS)","Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), U.S. Department of Interior; U.S. Department of the Interior, BOEM, Alaska Outer Continental Shelf Region, Anchorage, Alaska as part of the Hanna Shoal Ecosystem Project; BOEM Alaska Environmental Studies Program; North Pacific Research Board, Project; Pacific Marine Arctic Regional Synthesis (PacMARS)","We thank Heather Crowley of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), U.S. Department of Interior, for her interest and enthusiasm for studies of metals in biota.

The N fertilizer was applied in the form of urea [(NH2)(2)CO) at three rates (0, 36.8, 73.6 kg N ha(-1)). Plant growth (height and dry weight) was enhanced by the first N rate but not further enhanced by the highest rate. The endogenous GA contents were analyzed through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-selected ion monitoring (GC-MS-SIM) while that of JA with GC-MS-SIM. They were analyzed one week after N application and were significantly increased with elevated N levels in all rice cultivars. The bioactive GA, markedly increased, but its concentration differed in different rice cultivars. Similar fluctuations were observed for endogenous GA., GA(12), GA(19), GA(20), and GA(53) in response to elevated N levels, showing that the rates of biosynthesis of GAs were differently affected by elevated N levels within different rice cultivars. The level of GA(20,) a precursor of GA, biosynthesis, was not significantly increased, though GA(19), a precursor of GA20, was found to be the most abundant GA type in all rice cultivars. Jasmonic acid content in the plants increased with the basic urea application (36.8 kg N ha(-1)), but significantly decreased with the double urea level (73.6 kg N ha(-1)). The results demonstrate that GA and JA are differentially affected in response to elevated N application in rice.","[Hamayun, Muhammad; Sohn, Eun-Young; Shin, Dong-Hyun; Kim, Kii-Ung; Lee, In-Jung] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Div Plant Biosci, Taegu, South Korea; [Jang, Soo-Won] KT & G Cent Res Inst, Chungbuk, South Korea; [Lee, Byung-Hyun] Gyeongsang Natl Univ, Div Appl Life Sci, Jinju, South Korea","Kyungpook National University; Gyeongsang National University","Lee, IJ (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Div Plant Biosci, Taegu, South Korea.","ijlee@knu.ac.kr","Hamayun, Muhammad/B-1694-2010; Lee, In-Jung/GLS-0432-2022; Hamayun, Muhammad/I-8015-2015","Hamayun, Muhammad/0000-0003-4264-5870; Lee, In-Jung/0000-0001-7154-4820; ","","","",NA,"29","21","23","2","39","WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH","WEINHEIM","POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","1436-8730","1522-2624","","J PLANT NUTR SOIL SC","J.

Germination of this species was evaluated to understand its ecological response. We tested the effects of different pre-germination treatments (cold, and dry and wet heat) and storage time, as well as those of natural priming in two microhabitats with different disturbance levels. Experiments were performed in laboratory conditions under constant (25 A degrees C) and fluctuating (20/30 A degrees C) temperatures. Seeds did not germinate during burial and proved to be positively photoblastic. Under pre-germination treatments, final germination percentage was higher at 20/30 A degrees C in seeds after four or more months of storage. None of the pre-germination treatments favored germination. Seeds can survive for more than 1 year and form a seed bank. Thus, seeds underwent natural priming that favored final germination percentage; however, germination rate and lag time were not affected by this process. In natural conditions, germination is delayed until the rainy season, improving the success of seedling establishment and growth. We discuss the role of fluctuating temperature in germination processes and the adaptations of seeds to their seasonal environment.","[Martinez-Villegas, Jorge A.; Pisanty, Irene] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Grp Ecol Poblac, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Fac Ciencias, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Orozco-Segovia, Alma; Sanchez-Coronado, Maria Esther] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Lab Ecol Fisiol, Dept Ecol Func, Inst Ecol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Pisanty, I (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Grp Ecol Poblac, Dept Ecol & Recursos Nat, Fac Ciencias, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.","ipisanty170@gmail.com","","Martinez-Villegas, Jorge A./0000-0003-0734-6146; Orozco-Segovia, Alma/0000-0003-0143-6343","UNAM [IN222508]","UNAM(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico)","This study is part of the Terrestrial Ecology and Biotic Resource Management workshop (Facultad de Ciencias, UNAM) and was supported by the Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion y de Innovacion Tecnologica, UNAM (Grant IN222508).

We documented the association between an acanthocephalan parasite and survival, reproduction and growth of a Caribbean termite (Nasutitermes acajutlae). We measured these parameters yearly in >100 termite colonies for 4 years. In 2001 and 2002 we also compared the rate at which parasitized and unparasitized colonies rebuilt damaged foraging trails because trails protect foragers from predation as well as fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Although there were no significant differences in growth or survival between parasitized and unparasitized colonies, parasitized colonies reproduced significantly less often and rebuilt foraging trails significantly more slowly than unparasitized colonies. The average parasitized colony may sustain a loss of alate production greater than or equal to30% in the year in which it is parasitized, and a loss of up to 19% if it is parasitized once in a 5-year period. We conclude that the acanthocephalan parasite is associated with significant alteration of fitness parameters of individual N. acajutlae colonies. However, prevalence of parasitism is low (6.8%) and alate production by non-parasitized colonies is likely to compensate for losses due to parasitism. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this parasite affects N. acajutlae at the population level.","Murray State Univ, Dept Biol, Murray, KY 42020 USA","Murray State University","Fuller, CA (corresponding author), Murray State Univ, Dept Biol, 334 Blackburn Hall, Murray, KY 42020 USA.","claire.fuller@murraystate.edu; puni@ou.edu","","","","","",NA,"28","7","8","0","6","SPRINGER BASEL AG","BASEL","PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND","0020-1812","1420-9098","","INSECT SOC","Insect.

For conventional maize cultivation in this region, the total dose of nitrogen fertilizer is usually broadcast early in the season to avoid the accessibility difficulties to the field late in the season. Drip fertigation allows the application of fertilizers throughout the season. Field experiments were conducted in a sub-humid region of Northeast China to investigate the influence of the number of fertigation events and the nitrogen applied on the nitrate content in the soil, plant growth, nitrogen uptake, and grain yield during the maize growing seasons in 2011, 2012, and 2013. The experiments used a single early-season fertigation and three in-season split fertigation events. For each fertigation treatment, four nitrogen levels of 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha(-1) were tested using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates. The results indicated that, for a given amount of nitrogen applied, the split fertigation treatments increased the nitrate content in the root zone during the late growing season, reducing the fluctuation of nitrate content in soil during the growing season. An increasing number of fertigation events and amount of nitrogen applied resulted in an increased aboveground plant biomass and nitrogen uptake of maize during the physiological maturity stage. Furthermore, the split in-season fertigation produced a significantly higher yield (approximately 5% at a significance level of p < 0.05) than a single early-season fertigation. Higher amounts of nitrogen applied produced higher maize yields for either the single fertigation treatments or the split fertigation treatments during the three experimental years. However, the difference between the nitrogen rates of 150 and 200 kg ha(-1) was not statistically significant We recommend a management practice of 150 to 200 kg ha(-1) of nitrogen applied in three in-season fertigation events to obtain high production while reducing the risk of nitrogen leaching.","[Liu, Y.] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Li, J.; Li, Y.] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China","China Agricultural University; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research","Li, J (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Dept Irrigat & Drainage, 20 Chegongzhuang West Rd, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.","lijs@iwhr.com","Li, Jiusheng/AAE-7859-2019","Li, Jiusheng/0000-0001-5482-0977","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2011BAD25B06, 2012BAD08B02]","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","Funding for this project was provided by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (Grant nos. 2011BAD25B06 and 2012BAD08B02).

Plants were drip-irrigated and submitted to non-limiting soil water conditions. Measurements of stem water potential at midday (Psi(stem)), trunk daily growth rate (TGR) and maximum daily trunk shrinkage (MDS) were related with meteorological variables. MDS presented the best fitting line-regressions with both the average air temperature and vapour pressure deficit during the period 11.00-15.00 h solar time, since the most important fraction of trunk shrinkage occurred during that period of time, reaching 74% of MDS (on average over the three years studied), and sometimes 90%. The cause of the poor correlation of MDS with ET0 is discussed.

Treatments included six temperature regimes, (constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30 degrees C, and two fluctuating day : night temperature regimes of 25 : 10 degrees C and 30 : 20 degrees C), two light levels (14 : 10 h light : dark photoperiod and 24 h dark environment), two substrates (peat and water) and two O-2 levels (atmospheric and low (4.34%) O-2 concentration) using a complete randomized block design. The average incubation period needed for seeds to germinate was shorter for T. domingenesis (1.1-19.5 days) than for C. jamaicense (26-46 days) and the final germination percentage was higher for T. domingensis than for C. jamaicense (85 vs. 42 %). Cladium jamaicense only germinated with fluctuating temperatures whereas T. domingensis germinated at all temperature regimes. Light was required for T. domingensis seeds to germinate, whereas C. jamaicense could germinate at a reduced rate in the dark. Peat substrate had a positive effect on germination in both species. Peat substrate shortened the incubation period for seeds of both species, enhanced germination of T. domingensis, especially at low temperatures, and enhanced germination of C. jamaicense in the dark. Low oxygen availability did not influence the germination of C. jamaicense but enhanced germination of T. domingensis at low temperatures. Although the two species differ significantly in their germination requirements and responses to specific environmental conditions, germination of both these species was enhanced by environmental conditions typical of exposed water saturated mudflats or sediment surfaces. Typha domingensis produces a large number of small seeds, which do not germinate when covered by sediment. In contrast, C. jamaicense produces fewer and larger seeds, with resources able to support growth through a thin layer of sediment or detritus. (C)2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

These conditions are associated with decreased tree growth and increased vulnerability to pests and diseases. The anatomy of tree rings responds to these environmental conditions. Quantitatively, the width of a tree ring is largely determined by the rate and duration of cell division by the vascular cambium. In the Mediterranean climate, this division may occur throughout almost the entire year. Alternatively, cell division may cease during relatively cool and dry winters, only to resume in the same calendar year with milder temperatures and increased availability of water. Under particularly adverse conditions, no xylem may be produced in parts of the stem, resulting in a missing ring (MR). A dendrochronological network of Pinus halepensis was used to determine the relationship of MR to ECE. The network consisted of 113 sites, 1,509 trees, 2,593 cores, and 225,428 tree rings throughout the distribution range of the species. A total of 4,150 MR were identified. Binomial logistic regression analysis determined that MR frequency increased with increased cambial age. Spatial analysis indicated that the geographic areas of south-eastern Spain and northern Algeria contained the greatest frequency of MR. Dendroclimatic regression analysis indicated a non-linear relationship of MR to total monthly precipitation and mean temperature. MR are strongly associated with the combination of monthly mean temperature from previous October till current February and total precipitation from previous September till current May. They are likely to occur with total precipitation lower than 50 mm and temperatures higher than 5 degrees C. This conclusion is global and can be applied to every site across the distribution area. Rather than simply being a complication for dendrochronology, MR formation is a fundamental response of trees to adverse environmental conditions. The demonstrated relationship of MR formation to ECE across this dendrochronological network in the Mediterranean basin shows the potential of MR analysis to reconstruct the history of past climatic extremes and to predict future forest dynamics in a changing climate.","[Novak, Klemen; de Luis, Martin; Saz, Miguel A.; Longares, Luis A.; Serrano-Notivoli, Roberto] Univ Zaragoza, Inst Invest Ciencias Ambientales, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Zaragoza, Spain; [Novak, Klemen; Raventos, Josep] Univ Alicante, Dept Ecol, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Cufar, Katarina] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Wood Sci & Technol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Gricar, Jozica] Slovenian Forestry Inst, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Di Filippo, Alfredo; Piovesan, Gianluca] Univ Tuscia, Dept Agr & Forestry Sci DAFNE, Dendrol Lab, Viterbo, Italy; [Rathgeber, Cyrille B.

Their growth rates, zooxanthellae and chlorophyll concentrations generally increased from winter to spring, and decreased from early summer to autumn. O. patagonica behaved like a tropical coral with respect to growth enhancement with increasing light intensities and temperature, whereas C. caespitosa acted more as a temperate coral; its growth was enhanced by increasing temperature, not irradiance. By contrast, Delta F/F-m' did not show any relationship with environmental parameters, but was significantly lower in shallow colonies, reflecting some down-regulation of photosystem II. Mean photosynthetically active radiation received by shallow water corals during summer (1000 to 1400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was as high as in some tropical regions. However, the diel cycle of Delta F/F-m' only showed a slight decrease at midday with a quick recovery soon afterwards, suggesting that the symbionts were either protected by coral pigments or adapted to light levels much higher than those usually experienced. Since C. caespitosa is mostly found in turbid environments and rarely in well-lit waters, its distribution in shallow water may be limited by factors other than light, such as competition with macroalgae. Results also showed that the 2 species inhabiting the NW Mediterranean Sea are under stress when temperatures become extremely cold or warm, during winters and summers, respectively.","","","Rodolfo-Metalpa, R (corresponding author), Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Davy Bldg, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.","riccardo.rodolfo-metalpa@plymouth.ac.uk","","Ferrier-Pages, Christine/0000-0002-0357-4486","Centre Scientifique of Monaco","Centre Scientifique of Monaco","This research was supported by the Centre Scientifique of Monaco.

We measured the partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) in peat-perlite substrate planted with petunia (Petunia x hybrida). There are distinct diurnal fluctuations in substrate pO(2), and these can be largely explained by changes in substrate temperature, which increase the amount of water vapor in the air in the substrate, diluting oxygen and other gases. Barometric pressure (p(air)) and substrate volumetric water content (theta) also affected substrate pO(2). Substrate pO(2) decreased with decreasing pair and with increasing.. Photosynthetic photon flux had a highly significant, but small effect on pO(2). Substrate density had no significant effect on pO(2). Overall, substrate pO(2) was between 19.1 and 20.6 kPa, even after watering the substrate to container capacity. The high air-filled porosity of the substrate (approximately 0.40 m(3).m(-3) after irrigation) may have prevented the development of anoxic conditions. Since such high levels of pO(2) are unlikely to induce any detrimental anoxic effects on plants, our data do not provide any supporting evidence for the idea that anoxia is an important potential problem in peat-perlite substrates.","[van Iersel, M.

Monoterpene (MT) and sesquiterpene (SQT) emissions rates were quantified in a total of 1236 individual branch enclosure samples. MT dominated coniferous emissions, producing greater than 95% of BVOC emissions. MT and SQT demonstrated short-term emission dependence with temperature. Two oxygenated MT, 1,8-cineol and piperitone, were both light and temperature dependent. Basal emission rates (BER, normalized to 1000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and 30 degrees C) were generally higher in spring and summer than in winter; MT seasonal BER from the coniferous trees maximized between 1.5 and 6.0 mu g g(-1), h(-1), while seasonal lows were near 0.1 mu g g(-1) h(-1). The fractional contribution of individual MT to total emissions was found to fluctuate with season. SQT BER measured from the coniferous trees ranged from <0.01 to 0.15 mu g g(-1) h(-1). BER of up to 1.2 mu g g(-1) h(-1) of the SQT germacrene B were found from Q gambelii, peaking in late summer. The beta-factor, used to define temperature dependence in emissions modeling, was not found to exhibit discernible growth season trends. A seasonal correction factor proposed by others in previous work to account for a sinusoidal shaped emission pattern was applied to the data. Varying levels of agreement were found between the data and model results for the different plant species seasonal data sets using this correction. Consequently, the analyses on this extensive data set suggest that it is not feasible to apply a universal seasonal correction factor across different vegetation species. A modeling exercise comparing two case scenarios, (1) without and (2) with consideration of the seasonal changes in emission factors illustrated large deviations when emission factors are applied for other seasons than those in which they were experimentally determined.

Species-specific responses to the range of microsites resulting from canopy gap formation may contribute to coexistence in tropical forests. We investigated the effects of four factors affected by canopy gap formation (red : far-red light, soil nitrate concentrations, soil temperature fluctuations and soil water potential) on the germination response of four pioneer Piper species (P. dilatatum, P. hispidum, P. marginatum and P peltatum) that are typically found in canopy gaps and clearings. 2. All four Piper species required light for maximum germination. However, the ratio of red : far-red light (R : FR) resulting in maximum germination varied between species. Piper peltatum will germinate in simulated understorey light conditions; P. dilatatum and P. hispidum require conditions typically found in small to medium gaps; while P. marginatum requires the conditions appropriate to large gaps. 3. Only P. marginatum was affected by nitrate concentration: elevated concentrations increased the germination rate. This suggests that this species could detect canopy gaps using a combination of high R : FR and elevated soil nitrate concentrations. 4. The germination rate of P. marginatum was least sensitive to low water potentials and high daytime temperatures characteristic of large gaps. Piper peltatum was most sensitive to these treatments, while P. dilatatum and P. hispidum were intermediate in response. 5. A principal components analysis of the ratios of germination in understorey to large gap conditions, for four variables, generated a significant axis that explained 88.5% of the variance in germination response between species. Differential species distribution along this axis, based on species-specific responses, may allow germination to occur in the most suitable microsite for onward growth of the seedling and contribute to species coexistence by reducing interspecific competition.","Univ Aberdeen, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland; Univ Illinois, Dept Plant Biol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","University of Aberdeen; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Daws, MI (corresponding author), Univ Aberdeen, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, St Machar Dr, Aberdeen AB24 3UU, Scotland.","","Burslem, David FRP/F-1204-2019","Burslem, David FRP/0000-0001-6033-0990; Dalling, James/0000-0002-6488-9895; Daws, Matthew/0000-0002-9120-4724","","","",NA,"42","122","133","1","36","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","OXFORD","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DG, OXON, ENGLAND","0269-8463","","","FUNCT ECOL","Funct.

Litter plays two major roles in forest ecosystems: firstly, litterfall is all inherent part of nutrient and carbon cycling, and secondly, litter forms a protective layer oil the soil surface that also regulates microclimatic conditions. By reviewing 152 years of litter manipulation experiments, I show that the effects or manipulating litter stem from changes in one, or both, of these two functions, and interactions between the variables influenced by the accumulation of litter can result in feedback mechanisms that may intensify treatment effects or mask responses, making the interpretation of results difficult. Long-term litter removal increased soil bulk density, overland flow, erosion, and temperature fluctuations and upset the soil water balance, causing lower soil water content during dry periods. Soil pH increased or decreased in response to manipulation treatments depending on forest type and initial soil pH, but unclear why there was no uniform response. Long-term litter harvesting severely depleted the forests of nutrients. Decreases in the concentrations of available P, Ca, Mg, and K in the soil occurred after only three to five years. The decline in soil N occurred over longer periods of time, and the relative loss was greater in soils with high initial nitrogen concentration. Tree growth declined with long-term litter removal, probably due to lower nutrient availability. Litter manipulation also added or removed large amounts of carbon thereby affecting microbial communities and altering soil respiration rates. Litter manipulation experiments have shown that litter cover acts as a physical barrier to the shoot emergence of small-seeded species; further, the microclimate maintained by the litter layer may be Favourable to herbivores and pathogens and is important in determining later seedling survival and performance. Litter manipulation altered the competitive outcomes between tree seedlings and forbs, thereby influencing species composition and diversity; changes in the species composition of understorey vegetation following treatments occurred rapidly. By decreasing substrate availability and altering the microclimate, litter removal changed fungal species composition and diversity and led to a decline in populations of soil fauna. However, litter addition did not provoke an corresponding increase in the abundance or diversity of fungi or soil fauna. Large-scale long-term studies are still needed in order to investigate the interactions between the many variables affected by litter, especially in tropical and boreal forests, which have received little attention. Litter manipulation treatments present an opportunity to assess the effects of increasing primary production in forest ecosystems; specific research aims include assessing the effect of changes in litter inputs on the carbon and nutrient cycles, decomposition processes, and the turnover of organic matter.","Dept Plant Sci, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England","","Sayer, EJ (corresponding author), Dept Plant Sci, Downing St, Cambridge CB2 3EA, England.","","Sayer, Emma/B-2514-2010","Sayer, Emma/0000-0002-3322-4487","","","",NA,"170","483","568","42","620","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1464-7931","1469-185X","","BIOL REV","Biol.

Climate change will cause changes in average temperature and precipitation as well as increased fluctuations around the mean, yet few studies have considered the impacts of altered climate variability on plant populations. We tested whether life-history traits (expected life span, generation time and seed size) can predict plant responses to increased environmental variability across similar plant species sharing the same habitat. 2. We combined long-term demographic data on 10 prairie forb species with stochastic demography techniques to estimate the effects of potential changes in matrix element means and variances on the long-term stochastic population growth rate. 3. For all 10 species, recruitment had higher contribution and elasticity values than survival, meaning that climate change is more likely to influence population growth through effects on recruitment than on survival for these relatively short-lived forbs. Species with longer generation times had lower elasticities to increases in matrix element variability. 4. Synthesis. Our analysis of a unique, long-term data set suggests that longer-lived plant species will be less vulnerable to the effects of future increases in climate variability. While this relationship was previously reported for diverse taxa from many locations, our results show that it also applies within a guild of short-lived species from a single community. The generality of the pattern demonstrates the potential for using life-history traits to make predictions about which species may be the most vulnerable to climate change.","[Dalgleish, Harmony J.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA","Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University","Dalgleish, HJ (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, 5230 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.","h.dalgleish@usu.edu","Adler, Peter B./D-3781-2009","","NSF [DEB-0624880, DEB-0614068]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station; Utah State University","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Utah Agricultural Experiment Station; Utah State University","The authors thank the Handling Editor, three anonymous referees and James Bullock for helpful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript.

In the Sierra Nevada of California, Didymosphenia and other taxa that produce mucopolysaccharide stalks (e.g., Gomphoneis, Cymbella) can dominate benthic environments, particularly in the altered hydrologic and thermal regimes downstream of dams. We compared the prevalence of stalked diatoms in paired reaches, one free-flowing and the other regulated, within two Sierran river systems, the American and Feather Rivers. In the regulated reaches, short-term power generation caused daily flow fluctuations and periphyton biovolume was dominated by either Didymosphenia (where hypolimnetic releases created cool summer temperatures) or other stalked diatom taxa (where temperatures were warm). Periphyton assemblages from the unregulated sites were significantly different from the regulated reaches based on biovolume, with Gomphonema being the genus at unregulated sites contributing to the dissimilarities after accounting for the stalked genera from the regulated reaches. We evaluated the consequences of mucopolysaccharides for a large-bodied grazer, tadpoles of the foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii), in a factorial experiment manipulating diet and thermal regime. At 16.6 degrees C mean daily temperature, tadpoles lost weight (72h relative change of-16.1 +/- 7.2%) when grazing on periphyton from a Didymosphenia-dominated site. At 19.9 degrees C (similar to unregulated river conditions), tadpoles grazed Didymosphenia at a rate similar to tadpoles consuming higher protein control periphyton, but the former tadpoles did not grow (relative change of 4.3 +/- 5.4% vs 30.7 +/- 3.4% for control periphyton). When tadpoles were fed periphyton dominated by mucilaginous stalked diatoms other than Didymosphenia, tadpole weight loss was 21.0 +/- 9.2% (cool) and 16.6 +/- 5.6% (warm). The results illustrate that hydrologically or thermally mediated shifts in periphyton composition can have significant implications for the energy transferred to grazers.","[Furey, P.

These unusual conditions have spawned several field programs and laboratory experiments to determine why this high nitrate-low chlorophyll pattern persists in this region. To synthesize the results from these field programs, as well as providing additional evidence in support of the iron hypothesis, we developed a one-dimensional, nine-component ecosystem model of 0 degrees N 140 degrees W. The model components include two phytoplankton size fractions, two zooplankton size fractions, two detrital size fractions, dissolved iron, nitrate, and ammonium. The model was run for 5 years (1990-1994) and was forced using an atmospheric radiative transfer model, an ocean general circulation model (GCM), and in situ data. To our knowledge, this is the first ecosystem model at 0 degrees N 140 degrees W to synthesize the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study Equatorial Pacific Process Study (JGOFS EqPac) data set, as well as to use both in situ and modeled physical data to drive the model. Modeled phytoplankton, zooplankton, and iron all varied on interannual timescales due to El Nino events. Total phytoplankton biomass increased by as much as 40% from early 1992 (El Nino warm) to 1993 (normal). The results also indicate that the biomass increase during a cool period is not constant for each phytoplankton component, but instead the increase is most evident in the netphytoplankton (>10 mu m). Netphytoplankton increase from a low of 0.1% of the total chlorophyll in 1992 to a high of 30% of the total in 1993. Microzooplankton grazing rates fluctuated in response to changes in nanophytoplankton growth rates, whereas mesozooplankton grazing was unrelated to netphytoplankton growth rates. The magnitude and temporal variability of phytoplankton chlorophyll agreed well with in situ data collected during 1992. Modeled primary production was lower than measured during El Nino but agreed with observations during normal conditions. The low primary productivity was probably a result of downwelling produced by the physical model. New production was calculated from total and recycled iron rather than nitrate-based production and was more variable in general and almost 3 times the nitrate-based new production during non-El Nino conditions.","Univ Maryland, Marine Estuarine Environm Sci Program, College Pk, MD USA; NASA, WiFS Project Off, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; Univ Maryland, Joint Ctr Earth Syst Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Old Dominion Univ, Ctr Coastal Phys Oceanog, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; Univ Maryland, Horn Point Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Cambridge, MD USA; Univ Maryland, Maryland Sea Grant Coll, College Pk, MD 20742 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASA Goddard Space Flight Center; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Old Dominion University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park","Leonard, CL (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.","","Murtugudde, Raghu/M-9571-2019","","","","",NA,"57","68","69","0","10","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","WASHINGTON","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","2169-9275","2169-9291","","J GEOPHYS RES-OCEANS","J.

In the field, light intensity can fluctuate drastically within a day. The objective of the present study is to examine how higher SD affects stomatal conductance (g(s)) and CO2 assimilation rate (A) dynamics, biomass production and water use under fluctuating light. Here, we compared the photosynthetic and growth characteristics under constant and fluctuating light among three lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.): the wild type (WT), STOMAGEN/EPFL9-overexpressing line (ST-OX), and EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 1 knockout line (epf1). ST-OX and epf1 showed 268.1 and 46.5% higher SD than WT (p < 0.05). Guard cell length of ST-OX was 10.0% lower than that of WT (p < 0.01). There were no significant variations in gas exchange parameters at steady state between WT and ST-OX or epf1, although these parameters tended to be higher in ST-OX and epf1 than WT. On the other hand, ST-OX and epf1 showed faster A induction than WT after step increase in light owing to the higher g(s) under initial dark condition. In addition, ST-OX and epf1 showed initially faster g(s) induction and, at the later phase, slower g(s) induction. Cumulative CO2 assimilation in ST-OX and epf1 was 57.6 and 78.8% higher than WT attributable to faster A induction with reduction of water use efficiency (WUE). epf1 yielded 25.6% higher biomass than WT under fluctuating light (p < 0.01). In the present study, higher SD resulted in faster photosynthetic induction owing to the higher initial g(s). epf1, with a moderate increase in SD, achieved greater biomass production than WT under fluctuating light. These results suggest that higher SD can be beneficial to improve biomass production in plants under fluctuating light conditions.","[Sakoda, Kazuma; Yamori, Wataru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Nishitokyo, Japan; [Sakoda, Kazuma] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Shimada, Tomoo] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Kyoto, Japan; [Sugano, Shigeo S.] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Hara-Nishimura, Ikuko] Konan Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Tanaka, Yu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto, Japan; [Tanaka, Yu] PRESTO, JST, Kyoto, Japan","University of Tokyo; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Kyoto University; National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science & Technology (AIST); Konan University; Kyoto University; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)","Sakoda, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Nishitokyo, Japan.;Sakoda, K (corresponding author), Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan.","sakoda@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp","Yamori, Wataru/C-5680-2011; Sakoda, Kazuma/AAR-9644-2021; Tanaka, Yu/GQH-6268-2022","Yamori, Wataru/0000-0001-7215-4736; Tanaka, Yu/0000-0003-2106-4217","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [22000014, 15H05776, 20J00594, 16H06552, 18H02185, 18KK0170, 20H05687, 20H02968]; PRESTO from Japan Science and Technology Agencys [JPMJPR16Q5]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [18KK0170, 20H02968, 18H02185, 20J00594] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); PRESTO from Japan Science and Technology Agencys; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research to IH-N (Grant Nos. 22000014 and 15H05776), to KS (Grant No. 20J00594), to WY (Grant Nos. 16H06552, 18H02185, 18KK0170, and 20H05687), and to YT (Grant No. 20H02968) from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), and PRESTO to YT (Grant No. JPMJPR16Q5) from Japan Science and Technology Agencys.",NA,"53","33","34","12","52","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-462X","","","FRONT PLANT SCI","Front.

Seawater temperature ranged from 28 to 31 degreesC, with a daily fluctuation range between 25.9 and 31.9 degreesC. Irradiance showed a strong fluctuation along the study period with maximal recorded irradiance during April (881.8 mumol photon m(-2) s(-1)). Ammonia accounted for 55.1-89.8% of total DIN depending on the season, and salinity did not change significantly. Temperature was the only environmental factor that explained 96% of the observed variation in K. alvarezii growth rate (R-2=0.96). The highest average growth rates obtained were 6.5 +/- 1% day(-1) for the red strain, 7.1 +/- 1.8% day(-1) for the brown strain, and 8.1 +/- 1.6% day(-1) for green strain during June. Lowest growth rates were obtained during August and September for the green strain (2.0 +/- 0.6% day(-1)). Despite the significant differences in growth between months no significant differences among color strains were found (P>0.05). The growth rates of K. alvarezii were exponential during April to June. A 10-fold increase in weight was obtained after 30 days in cultivation for all the colored strains. As propagule weight increased the growth rate was reduced. Further, biomass yield (% weight gained) fluctuated as propagule weight increased and averaged 33.2 +/- 8.4% for the green, 35.4 +/- 6.0% for the red and 36.3 +/- 10.8% for the brown strain after 15 days. The highest carrageenan yield was obtained for the green strain (40.7%), whereas average carrageenan yields for the red strain were 32.7 +/- 3.9% and 37.5 +/- 1.1% for the brown. This study shows that K. alvarezii can be grown in the tropical waters of the Yucatan peninsula during the dry and part of the wet season. This period coincided with the closed season of the main fisheries. Thus, seaweed farming could be proposed as an alternative activity in the area. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It grows mainly on mobile dunes, and it is the first colonizer. In this study we present information regarding the plant's geographical distribution, range of habitats, physiological ecology, population biology, reproduction, its role in geomorphology and interactions with other species. Ch. chamaecristoides is very tolerant to drought and low nutrient availability in the soil. Biomass accumulation and relative growth rates increase significantly when seedlings are covered by sand. The legume may be considered as a nurse plant that modifies environmental conditions and facilitates the successional process. Temperature fluctuations in the shade of adult plants decrease noticeably when compared with bare sand temperatures. Further, bacterial and mycorrhizal associations are abundant. All these characteristics probably play an important role in dune dynamics since late colonizers are only able to arrive after Ch. chamaecristoides has reached a rather high (2x2m) plant cover. The plant's hard coated seeds germinate gradually throughout the year, after seeds have been exposed to naturally occurring temperature fluctuations on the sand surface. Seedling mortality is very high during the first three months, and only 5% reach adult stage. Winter storms are a major cause of death, since drought and sand movement become drastic during these months (November to March). We found that seedling size plays an important role in survival and reproduction. Larger seedlings are the ones with higher survival rates and reproduce earlier. Ch. chamaecristoides plants decrease sand movement and hold the substrate together, promoting dune stabilization. This is important to humans, since mobile dunes continuously encroach nearby roads, cities and crop fields. There is no practical experience in dune stabilization with this species.","Inst Ecol AC, Dept Ecol Vegetal, Xalapa 91000, Ver, Mexico","Instituto de Ecologia - Mexico","Martinez, ML (corresponding author), Inst Ecol AC, Dept Ecol Vegetal, Km 2-5 Antigua Carretera Coatepec, Xalapa 91000, Ver, Mexico.","","Martinez, M.

The aim was to describe the effects of the short term dynamics of environmental factors on the algal growth. The results could then be used to discuss the existing theories to assess the start of phytoplankton growth pulses in spring. Only 7 to 10 days without wind driven vertical mixing were required in spring to start the first growth pulse, despite of a still very unstable water column (sometimes inverse thermal stratification). Mainly flagellates and Stephanodiscus hantzschii increased their biomass and achieved net growth rates of 0.1 and up to 0.65 d(-1) respectively During such a phase the mixing depth was always smaller than the euphotic depth. Later on, at the start of the spring bloom (= last growth pulse in spring before the clear water stage), the intensity of vertical mixing as well as the mixing depth were markedly reduced due to an increase in heat input and low wind. Then flagellates dominated (contribution up to 75.5 % of the areal biomass reaching 60 g fresh weight m(-2)) and the growth rate rose to a maximum of 0.65 d(-1). Standard models of critical depth considers that there is only a biomass increase if the mixing depth is smaller than the depth of a water layer positive balanced between production and respiration. This model for determining the beginning of a phytoplankton growth pulse in spring takes no account of the favorable light conditions for phytoplankton cells at calm and sunny days in February and March. The newly developed threshold value model takes these situations into account: It assumes that the phytoplankton biomass increases when the calculated effective light climate is equal or greater than a previously fixed threshold. The calculations are based on the mean light intensity within the mixed layer at windy days or within the euphotic depth (z(eu)) at calm days. In Lake Zurich a minimum of 0.2 10(6) J m(-2) d(-1) (= 0.9 mol quanta m(-2) d(-1)) has to be reached or surpassed in at least 3 days before an exponential increase of algal biomass can occur. The value does not depend on short term fluctuations in neither radiation nor mixing depth. It seems that this value is rather low comparing with those of investigations in other water bodies (up to 0.8 10(6) J m(-2) d(-1)) but high related to values from algal cultures (0.02 10(6) J m(-2) d(-1)). As the weather can only be forecasted a few days ahead with any certainty the period for a more or less accurate prediction of an algal bloom is restricted to about 1 to 5 days.","","","Bleiker, W (corresponding author), UNIV ZURICH,INST PLANT BIOL,LIMNOL STN,SEESTR 187,CH-8802 KILCHBERG,SWITZERLAND.","","","","","","",NA,"68","23","29","0","16","BIRKHAUSER VERLAG AG","BASEL","PO BOX 133 KLOSTERBERG 23, CH-4010 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1015-1621","","","AQUAT SCI","Aquat.

However, the susceptibility of alginate matrixes to cation chelating agents and to antigelling cations, which can cause bead disruption or dissolution, is a major limitation for in situ exposures in estuarine and marine systems. The ultimate goal of this study was to produce alginate beads stable in seawater and suited for Phaeodactylum tricornutum growth. For this, different concentrations of alginate isolated from Macrocystis pyrifera (1.5, 1.9 and 2.3% [w/v]) and Laminaria hyperborea (4.0, 4.9 and 5.8% [w/v]), two concentrations of the hardening cations calcium and strontium (2.0 and 4.0% [w/v]), and the use of the polycation chitosan were investigated. Only beads found to be more stable after 16 days of exposure in seawater were inoculated with the microaloa. P. tricornutum immobilized in beads prepared from 5.8% L. hyperborea alginate and in all beads in which a chitosan hardening treatment was applied showed a weak microalgal growth. Beads prepared using 4.9% of L. hyperborea alginate and a 4% (w/v) strontium solution were found to be the most stable and the most suitable for microalgoal growth, and were exposed in the field, under natural fluctuating conditions of light and temperature. In situ growth rates of immobilized P. tricornutum cells demonstrated the potential of these beads for future use in in situ experiments in estuarine and marine systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Leaf litter decomposition and nutrient dynamics of four important agroforestry tree species viz., Bhimal (Grewia optiva Drummond ex Burret), Sehtoot (Morus alba L.), Tun (Toona ciliata M. Roem) and Poplar (Populus deltoides Bartr. ex Marsh.) were studied by placing the leaf litter in surface and plough/sub-surface layer for one year. Decomposition rate was highest in M. alba followed by G optiva, T ciliata and P deltoides for both the placements. Sub-surface placed litter showed faster rate of decomposition than surface placed leaf litter. Rate of decomposition in all the four species was influenced significantly and positively by combined effect of rainfall and temperature. Relationship between cumulative weight loss and substrate/litter quality attributes viz., Ca, acid detergent fiber (ADF), lignin and cellulose was significant but negative. Nitrogen and water-soluble compounds (WSC) content on the other hand showed positive and significant correlation with cumulative weight loss. Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) dynamics in decomposing litter revealed that concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium did not follow any specific trend during the decomposition process. Potassium and magnesium concentration, however, revealed a decreasing trend throughout the study period. Changes in absolute amount, on the other hand, followed a release pattern throughout the study period for N, K and Mg.

Notwithstanding, few studies have assessed the drought effect on vessel traits in tropical montane cloud trees of eastern Mexico. Methods Through digital images of growth rings, we assessed the tree radial growth rate, age of the trees and plasticity in vessel traits regarding climatic fluctuations of the Mexican Magnolia species studied. We compared vessel density, hydraulic diameter and percentage of conductive area in drought years (DY) and non-drought years (NDY) in two Mexican Magnolia species. Important Findings For the first time, the plasticity that occurs in porous wood vessel traits to long-term climatic fluctuations was analysed for two endangered Magnolia species (Magnolia vovidesii and M. schiedeana) from two tropical montane cloud forests in Mexico. We found that temperature and precipitation were strongly associated with differences in tree-ring width when DY and NDY were compared. Our analyses revealed that a high plasticity in vessel anatomy of diffuse-porous wood was related to temperature and/or water availability for both Magnolia species studied. We concluded that anatomical adaptations to DY resulted in a substantial reduction in vessel traits when compared with NDY, and that the plastic adaptations played an essential role in water transport and safety for the survival of the studied species during stressful long periods.","[Rodriguez-Ramirez, Emesto Chanes; Alcantara-Ayala, Othon; Luna-Vega, Isolda] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Evolut, Lab Biogeog & Sistemat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Antonio Vazquez-Garcia, Jose] Univ Guadalajara, Ctr Univ Ciencias Biol & Agr, Dept Bot & Zool, Lab Ecosistemat,Inst Bot, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico; [Garcia-Gonzalez, Ignacio] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Escola Politecn Super Enxenaria, Dept Bot, Lugo, Spain","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad de Guadalajara; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela","Luna-Vega, I (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Evolut, Lab Biogeog & Sistemat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.","luna.isolda@gmail.co","Luna-Vega, Isolda/X-3043-2018; García-González, Ignacio/C-1439-2009; Vázquez, Antonio/AAC-3461-2020","Luna-Vega, Isolda/0000-0002-7243-9018; García-González, Ignacio/0000-0001-8460-2401; Vázquez, Antonio/0000-0002-8393-5906; Rodriguez Ramirez, Ernesto Chanes/0000-0001-6206-8615","DGAPA PAPIIT [IN223218]","DGAPA PAPIIT(Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos de Investigacion e Innovacion Tecnologica (PAPIIT))","This work was supported by the DGAPA PAPIIT IN223218 project.",NA,"90","13","13","0","33","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","1752-9921","1752-993X","","J PLANT ECOL","J.

However; other climate variables including temperature; humidity; the frequency and intensity of precipitation events are also known to affect productivity; either directly by changing photosynthesis and transpiration rates or indirectly by influencing water availability and plant physiology. The aim here is to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation responses to precipitation and to additional; relevant; meteorological variables. First; an empirical; statistical analysis of the relationship between precipitation and the additional meteorological variables and a proxy of vegetation productivity (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; NDVI) is reported and; second; a process-oriented modeling approach to explore the hydrologic and biophysical mechanisms to which the significant empirical relationships might be attributed. The analysis was conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa; between 5 and 18 degrees N; for a 25-year period 1982-2006; and used a new quasi-daily Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) dataset. The results suggest that vegetation; particularly in the wetter areas; does not always respond directly and proportionately to precipitation variation; either because of the non-linearity of soil moisture recharge in response to increases in precipitation; or because variations in temperature and humidity attenuate the vegetation responses to changes in water availability. We also find that productivity; independent of changes in total precipitation; is responsive to intra-annual precipitation variation. A significant consequence is that the degree of correlation of all the meteorological variables with productivity varies geographically; so no one formulation is adequate for the entire region. Put together; these results demonstrate that vegetation responses to meteorological variation are more complex than an equilibrium relationship between precipitation and productivity. In addition to their intrinsic interest; the findings have important implications for detection of anthropogenic dryland degradation (desertification); for which the effects of natural fluctuations in meteorological variables must be controlled in order to reveal non-meteorological; including anthropogenic; degradation.","[Rishmawi, Khaldoun; Prince, Stephen D.] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20782 USA; [Xue, Yongkang] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA","University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles","Prince, SD (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20782 USA.","sprince@umd.edu; yxue@geog.ucla.edu","; xue, yongkang/M-6756-2018","Rishmawi, Khaldoun/0000-0001-7319-1782; xue, yongkang/0000-0002-6169-9631","NASA [000420]; Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences [1346813, 1419526] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NASA(National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA)); Div Atmospheric & Geospace Sciences; Directorate For Geosciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO))","This work was partly supported by NASA grant 000420 (NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center) (PI S.

For both species, the abundance time series shows the occasional development of blooms of aggregate zooids. Several hydrological and meteorological variables were recorded concomitantly, and their influence on the occurrence of blooms was evaluated using a Markov regression model for ordinal time series. Abundance at Week t was found to depend on the size of the population for the 2 previous weeks and on environmental variables. The influence of hydrological variables, air temperature and irradiance corresponds to the relationship between seasonal stratification of the water column and occurrence of blooms: the stronger the stratification, the lower the probability of observing high densities of salps. Wind stress was also found to exert a significant influence, with gusts of wind facilitating the development of blooms through the renewal of the pelagic production. The influence of easterly winds, which involves a process of surface waters accumulating near the coast, is limited to T. democratica. Conversely, the influence of westerly winds, which leads to local upwelling, is limited to S. fusiformis. These results are consistent with known differences in the spatial distribution of T. democratica and S. fusiformis with respect to both distance to the coast and depth.","OBSERV OCEANOL, URA 716, ZOOL STN, F-06230 VILLEFRANCHE SUR MER, FRANCE","UDICE-French Research Universities; Sorbonne Universite","MENARD, F (corresponding author), DEPT BIOSTAT & INFORMAT MED, 1 AV CLAUDE VELLEFAUX, F-75475 PARIS 10, FRANCE.","","Menard, Frederic/C-3913-2008","Menard, Frederic/0000-0003-1162-660X","","","",NA,"55","55","57","0","8","INTER-RESEARCH","OLDENDORF LUHE","NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY","0171-8630","","","MAR ECOL PROG SER","Mar.

Phosphorus (P) is a major nutrient required for many physiological and biochemical functions of a plant. Phosphate rock is the major source of phosphate fertilizer but is becoming increasingly limited in both developing and developed countries. The resources of phosphate rock need to be conserved, and import dependency on phosphate fertilizer needs to be minimized; this will help increase the availability of phosphate fertilizer over the next 300 yr. Climate change creates new challenges in the management of nutrients including P, affecting the overall production of crops. The availability, acquisition, and translocation of P are influenced by the fluctuation of temperatures, pH, drought, and elevated CO2. Both lower and higher soil temperatures reduce uptake and translocation of P. High soil pH affects P concentration and decreases the rate of plant P uptake. Low soil pH decreases the activity of soil microorganisms, the rate of transpiration, and P uptake and utilization. Elevated CO2 decreases P uptake from soil by the plants. Future research is needed on chemical, molecular, microbiological, and physiological aspects to improve the understanding on how temperature, pH, drought, and elevated CO2 affect the availability, acquisition, and transport of P by plants. Better P management strategies are required to secure the P supply to ensure long-term protection of soil fertility and to avoid environmental impacts such as eutrophication and water pollution, ensuring sustainable food production.","[Maharajan, Theivanayagam; Ceasar, Stanislaus Antony; Krishna, Thumadath Palayullaparambil Ajeesh] Rajagiri Coll Social Sci, Dept Biosci, Kalamassery 683104, Kerala, India; [Ignacimuthu, Savarimuthu] St Xaviers Coll, Xavier Res Fdn, Palayankottai 620002, Tamil Nadu, India","Rajagiri College of Social Sciences","Ceasar, SA (corresponding author), Rajagiri Coll Social Sci, Dept Biosci, Cochin 683104, Kerala, India.","antony_sm2003@yahoo.co.in","Krishna, Ajeesh/HNI-7893-2023; Maharajan, Theivanayagam/GZL-9772-2022; CEASAR, STANISLAUS ANTONY/P-2479-2017","Krishna, Ajeesh/0000-0002-7788-4436; Maharajan, Theivanayagam/0000-0002-7343-2854; CEASAR, STANISLAUS ANTONY/0000-0003-4106-1531; Ignacimuthu, S/0000-0002-8467-789X","","","",NA,"214","11","11","13","60","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0047-2425","1537-2537","","J ENVIRON QUAL","J.

Vegetation diversity and soil bio-physicochemical properties according to five elevations classes (800 m, 1000 m, 1100 m, 1200 m, and 1500 m a.s.l.) in the Southern Taihang Mountain were investigated. Soil ammonium-N (NH4+-N), nitrate-N (NO3--N), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and nitrogen (MBN), as well as soil urease (URE) and sucrose (SUC) activities were determined. The results showed that elevation gradients, soil layers, and their interaction had significant effects on most of the active soil substances. With the rise of elevation, soil NO3--N, inorganic N, MBC, and MBN contents, as well as SUC activity and SUC/MBC ratio basically showed an inverted V-shaped distribution trend and reached the peak value at 1100 m (p < 0.05). Soil URE showed a fluctuating upward trend and reached the peak value at 1500 m (p < 0.05), and the URE/MBC ratio showed a straight upward trend. With the depth of soil layer, the contents of active soil substances tended to decrease, showing a phenomenon of surface aggregation. Active soil substances were correlated with plant community diversity indexes, soil water content, pH, available N, and available phosphorus contents, and available N was the main factor affecting active soil substances, which could explain 34.4% of the variation. In summary, at the intermediate slope of 1100 m, soil moisture and tightness were suitable for soil microbial activity and plant growth, the highest contents of active soil substances, indicating a fast turnover of soil carbon and nitrogen.

The production of poinsettia demands intensively managed light control, heat, fertilizer, and water; inhibiting elongation with plant growth regulators, and protecting plants from diseases and pests with pesticide applications. Excessive irrigation creates pollution, promotes disease, and is expensive. Sensor-based control systems can optimize irrigation schedules. Irrigation management is crucial in nursery production of poinsettias because water is a limited resource and agricultural runoff is monitored in many states across the United States. By pairing environmental sensors with sensors that continuously monitor plant transpiration, we can determine how plant water use and water stress fluctuate with environmental and physiological demands. We hypothesized that continual measurements of sap flow could be correlated with environmental sensors to develop a new water stress index (WSI), which can deliver the benefits of detecting water stress that might affect the quality of potted poinsettias. To test this hypothesis, rooted cuttings of poinsettia (E. pulcherrima cv. Prestige Red) were individually potted into twelve 11-L black plastic nursery pots. Potted plants were grown in a naturally illuminated temperature-controlled glasshouse. The 12 plants were randomly assigned one of three watering treatments: weekly, biweekly, and triweekly irrigation. From the data collected, we were able to create a WSI that correlated available soil moisture with the difference between the expected transpiration with actual transpiration rates. Our results suggest that the plants in the weekly treatment group did not experience water stress until 0.3 m(3).m(-3) volume water content indicated by <0.2 WSI.

Although the distributional range of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Lepidoptera Notodontidae) appears to be expanding northward and upslope with climate warming, the relative importance of climate and endogenous, density-dependent factors has not been clearly documented. We analyzed the population dynamics of the moth using long-term data from two provinces in the Southern Alps (Trento: 1990-2009, Bolzano/Bozen: 1975-2011) to evaluate the relative importance of climate and density-dependent factors as regional drivers. Both summer temperatures and rainfall significantly affected population growth rate, with different outcomes depending on the local conditions. Although previous studies indicated that low winter temperatures have negative effects on insect performance, our analyses did not show any negative effect on the population dynamics. A negative density dependent feedback with a 1-year lag emerged as the most important factor driving the population dynamics in both regions. Potential mechanisms explaining the observed negative density feedback include deterioration of host quality, increased mortality caused by pathogens, and increase of prolonged diapause as an adaptive mechanism to escape adverse conditions.","[Tamburini, Giovanni; Marini, Lorenzo; Battisti, Andrea] Univ Padua, DAFNAE Entomol, I-35020 Padua, Italy; [Salvadori, Cristina] FEM, Technol Transfer Ctr, I-38010 San Michele All Adige, Italy","University of Padua; Fondazione Edmund Mach","Tamburini, G (corresponding author), Univ Padua, DAFNAE Entomol, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Padua, Italy.","giovanni.tamburini@studenti.unipd.it","Battisti, Andrea/F-6243-2015; Marini, Lorenzo/B-1119-2009; Tamburini, Giovanni/AAH-2012-2021","Battisti, Andrea/0000-0002-2497-3064; Marini, Lorenzo/0000-0001-7429-7685; Tamburini, Giovanni/0000-0001-7546-8183","BACCARA; European Community [226299a]; University of Padova","BACCARA; European Community(European Commission); University of Padova","We are indebted to Stefano Minerbi of the Forest and Fauna Service of Autonomous Provinces of Bolzano/Bozen for providing data and assistance, and to the team of Trento Forest Service for allowing us to use data from the Forest Health Monitoring.

In shaded environments, plants must respond to reduced light intensity to ensure a regular rate of photosynthesis to maintain the dynamic balance of nutrients, such as leaf non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). To improve our understanding of the nutrient utilization strategies of understory shade-tolerant plants, we compared the variations in leaf NSCs, C, N and P in response to heterogeneous controlled light conditions between two subtropical evergreen broadleaf shade-tolerant species, Elaeocarpus sylvestris (E. sylvestris) and Illicium henryi (I. henrys). Light intensity treatments were applied at five levels (100%, 52%, 33%, 15% and 6% full sunlight) for 30 weeks to identify the effects of reduced light intensity on leaf NSC allocation patterns and leaf C:N:P stoichiometry characteristics. We found that leaf soluble sugar, starch and NSC concentrations in E. sylvestris showed decreasing trends with reduced light intensity, whereas I. henryi presented slightly increasing trends from 100% to 15% full sunlight and then significant decreases at extremely low light intensity (6% full sunlight). The soluble sugar/starch ratio of E. sylvestris decreased with decreasing light intensity, whereas that of I. henryi remained stable. Moreover, both species exhibited increasing trends in leaf N and P concentrations but limited leaf N:P and C:P ratio fluctuations with decreasing light intensity, revealing their adaptive strategies for poor light environments and their growth strategies under ideal light environments. There were highly significant correlations between leaf NSC variables and C:N:P stoichiometric variables in both species, revealing a trade-off in photosynthesis production between leaf NSC and carbon allocation. Thus, shade-tolerant plants readjusted their allocation of leaf NSCs, C, N and P in response to light acclimation. Redundancy analysis showed that leaf morphological features of both E. sylvestris and I. henryi affected their corresponding leaf nutrient traits. These results improve our understanding of the dynamic balance between leaf NSCs and leaf C, N and P components in the nutritional metabolism of shade-tolerant plants. Key message: Two species of understory shade-tolerant plants responded differently to varying light intensities in terms of leaf non-structural carbohydrate allocation and the utilization of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to balance nutritional metabolism and adapt to environmental stress.","[Xie, Hongtao; Yu, Mukui; Cheng, Xiangrong] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Subtrop Forestry, Natl Res Stn Eastern China Coastal Forest Ecosyst, Hangzhou 311400, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, CAF","Cheng, XR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Subtrop Forestry, Natl Res Stn Eastern China Coastal Forest Ecosyst, Hangzhou 311400, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.","xiehongtaode@126.com; chxr@caf.ac.cn","","Xie, Hongtao/0000-0002-3556-0986","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31300519]; Chinese Academy of Forestry [16204002]; Zhejiang Province [16204002]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Forestry; Zhejiang Province","We are grateful to all of the group members and workers in Qianjia Village Tree Nursery Station for their assistance in the field experiment.

While warming is expected to have a pronounced effect on plankton communities, many components of the plankton seem fairly robust towards realistic end-of-century acidification conditions. However, interactions of the two stressors and the inclusion of further factors such as nutrient concentration and trophic interactions are expected to change this outcome. We investigated the effects of warming and high CO2 on a nutrient-deplete late summer plankton community from the Kiel Fjord, Baltic Sea, using a mesocosm setup crossing two temperatures with a gradient of CO2. Phytoplankton and microzooplankton (MZP) growth rates as well as biomass, taxonomic composition, and grazing rates of MZP were analysed. We observed effects of high CO2, warming, and their interactions on all measured parameters. The occurrence and direction of the effects were dependent on the phytoplankton or MZP community composition. In addition, the abundance of small-sized phytoplankton was identified as one of the most important factors in shaping the MZP community composition. Overall, our results indicate that an estuarine MZP community used to strong natural fluctuations in CO2 can still be affected by a moderate increase in CO2 if it occurs in combination with warming and during a nutrient-deplete post-bloom situation. This highlights the importance of including trophic interactions and seasonality aspects when assessing climate change effects on marine zooplankton communities.","[Horn, Henriette G.; Boersma, Maarten; Aberle, Nicole] Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Biolog Anstalt Helgoland, Helgoland 27483, Germany; [Horn, Henriette G.] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Estuarine & Delta Syst, Yerseke 4400 AC, Netherlands; [Horn, Henriette G.] Univ Utrecht, Yerseke 4400 AC, Netherlands; [Boersma, Maarten] Univ Bremen, Fac Biol Chem, Bremen 28334, Germany; [Garzke, Jessica; Sommer, Ulrich] GEOMAR Helmholtz Ctr Ocean Res Kiel, Kiel 24105, Germany; [Garzke, Jessica] Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; [Aberle, Nicole] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Trondhjem Biol Stn, Dept Biol, Trondheim 7491, Norway","Helmholtz Association; Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar & Marine Research; Utrecht University; Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ); Utrecht University; University of Bremen; Helmholtz Association; GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel; University of British Columbia; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU)","Horn, HG (corresponding author), Alfred Wegener Inst, Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Biolog Anstalt Helgoland, Helgoland 27483, Germany.;Horn, HG (corresponding author), NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Estuarine & Delta Syst, Yerseke 4400 AC, Netherlands.;Horn, HG (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Yerseke 4400 AC, Netherlands.","henriette.horn@nioz.nl","Aberle, Nicole/C-7366-2014; Boersma, Maarten/A-5475-2013; Horn, Henriette G./R-7667-2016","Aberle, Nicole/0000-0003-3254-5710; Boersma, Maarten/0000-0003-1010-026X; Horn, Henriette G./0000-0002-4020-5559","German Federal Ministry of Education and Science (BMBF) [03F0655B]","German Federal Ministry of Education and Science (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This study is part of the Verbundprojekt BIOACID phase II, consortium 1, WP 1.6 (03F0655B) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Science (BMBF).

For the glasshouse tomato production, the yield is reduced linearly with moderate EC mainly due to a reduction in individual fruit size. The basic effect of EC on tomato fruit growth is on its accumulation of water and nutrients, rather than photoassimilate. The benefit in higher fruit dry matter content is quite limited, since the yield reduction is only acceptable when it is compensated by the premium in the market. However, the fruit weight under the same EC can be improved by reducing the crop transpiration rate on fruit water relations and by CO2 enrichment on photoassimilate supply and on raising the salt tolerance level. Apart from selecting the acceptable EC range for tomato production, the application of instant EC adjustment based on micro-climate of the glasshouse or diurnal EC fluctuation in the root zone has not been successful. Apart from fruit weight reduction, high EC also increases the incidence of blossom-end rot (BER) caused by local Ca deficiency in the fast growing fruit. The severity of BER at high EC can be reduced by adjusting the nutrient composition of the feed (lower nitrate and ammonia nitrate), or by reducing the temperature-enhanced fruit growth. However, the application of split-root system appears to sustain the benefit of higher fruit dry matter content, while both the yield reduction and the incidence of BER is lessen. In glasshouse tomato production, the application of moderate EC in conjunction with fruit growth regulation by the supply of photoassimilate and water/nutrient can be beneficial for both crop yield and quality.","Hort Res Int, Wellesbourne CV35 9EF, Warwick, England","University of Warwick","Ho, LC (corresponding author), Hort Res Int, Wellesbourne CV35 9EF, Warwick, England.","LIM.HO@HRI.AC.UK","","","","","",NA,"29","5","5","0","1","INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE","LEUVEN 1","PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM","0567-7572","2406-6168","90-6605-996-6","ACTA HORTIC","","","2003",NA,"609","",NA,"",NA,"121","126","","10.17660/ActaHortic.2003.609.15","http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2003.609.15","","","6","Agronomy; Plant Sciences; Horticulture","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Agriculture; Plant Sciences","BX26J",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000184779000015","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, regarding the expected changes of global climate. Service tree should substitute some tender woody plants with higher sensitivity to drought in woodlands and landscape greenery. One of the key problems concerning the larger utilization of this species concerns its effective propagation. Successful propagation by seeds depends on rate of cross-pollination among fructifying plants (at least 3 flowering plants growing close to each other), in term of fruit collection and seed extraction. The presowing treatment of seeds is necessary for better germination response and reduction of germination period. Stratification of seeds under conditions with fluctuating temperatures is more effective than using constant temperature during the presowing treatment. Pricking out of seedlings is important to avoid problems with negative effect of competition among them. According to own unpublished results the best time for this operation is between the stage of first leaf full expansion until the stage of intensive shoot growth (approx. 10% of final length).","Slovak Univ Agr Nitra, Fac Hort & Landscape Engn, Biotech Verdure Dept, Nitra 94976, Slovakia","Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra","Paganova, V (corresponding author), Slovak Univ Agr Nitra, Fac Hort & Landscape Engn, Biotech Verdure Dept, Tulipanova 7, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.","viera.paganova@uniag.sk","Paganová, Viera/C-1639-2015; Paganová, Viera/AAU-7559-2020","Paganová, Viera/0000-0003-0183-2418; Paganová, Viera/0000-0003-0183-2418","","","",NA,"12","5","6","1","8","SEJANI PUBL","SOFIA","ET SEJANI-ALLA AJANOVA, SOFIA, 00000, BULGARIA","1311-9109","","","PROPAG ORNAM PLANTS","Propag.

In this study, we investigated whether the annual fluctuation in the population of Middle Spotted Woodpeckers Dendrocoptes medius can be attributed to the direct or delayed density-dependent regulation or to the density-independent factors such as weather conditions during the preceding winter and previous breeding season and/or disturbance in the habitat associated with sanitary felling and salvage logging of trees. This study was conducted in the Czeszewo Forest Reserve, which protects the remnants of semi-natural flood-plain forest, and in the Lowkowiec Forest, which is a managed oak-dominated stand, during 19 seasons (2001-2019). Time series diagnostic revealed that the growth rate of population of Middle Spotted Woodpecker in protected semi-natural riverine forest and in managed oak forest was determined by first-order negative feedback, suggesting an important role of direct density-dependent mortality in the regulation of an equilibrium in population size. The effect of density-dependent process varied between study sites, being lower in riverine forest, where population size has increased distinctly in recent years. In both study areas, we detected strong positive effects of wind chill temperature during the preceding winter on population growth rates. We did not find evidence for the assumption that the increase in population growth rate is affected by weather conditions in the previous breeding season and by the disturbance in the habitat associated with sanitary felling and salvage logging of trees. Our results suggest that Middle Spotted Woodpeckers can benefit from global climate warming by an enhanced rate of winter survival or an increase in the accessibility of food, e.g., insects and other arthropods. The lack of time-lag significant correlations between population fluctuations suggests local habitat conditions, e.g., forest management, can modify inter-annual variability in time series of the Middle Spotted Woodpecker.","[Kosinski, Ziemowit; Walczak, Lukasz] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Environm Biol, Fac Biol, Dept Avian Biol & Ecol, Uniwersytetu Poznanskiego 6, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland","Adam Mickiewicz University","Kosinski, Z (corresponding author), Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Inst Environm Biol, Fac Biol, Dept Avian Biol & Ecol, Uniwersytetu Poznanskiego 6, PL-61614 Poznan, Poland.","zkosinsk@amu.edu.pl","","Kosinski, Ziemowit/0000-0003-4991-6936","Polish Science Research Committee [3 P04F 00122]; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [NN304 014439]","Polish Science Research Committee; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)","We would like to thank Marcin Kempa, Pawe Ksit, Konrad Leniowski, Ewa Wgrzyn and Aleksander Winiecki for their assistance in the collection of data.

Soil amendments (biochar, polyacrylamide (PAM), and moringa) were used at different rates (0 (control), 2.1, 4.2, and 8.3 g kg(-1)) to improve the physical properties of the soil. As a result of soil amendment application, it was found that the mean weight diameter of soil aggregate increased by 188% during the 8.3 g kg(-1) treatment, forming stable soil particles. Soil water retention improved by up to 128.9% during the 8.3 g kg(-1 )treatment, and it was analyzed that it was due to the high surface area of biochar, porosity, and high molecular weight of PAM. Pellet treatment increased all plant growth parameters (height, stem diameter, leaf number, and fresh and dry weight) for both beans and maize. The dry weight of beans (C-3 plant) and maize (C-4 plant) increased by 92.9 and 146.4%, respectively in an 8.3 g kg(-1) pot. The soil physical condition was stabilized by the high carbon content of biochar and the improvement of soil coagulation between PAM and moringa. This had a positive effect on the C-4 plant.

In Jebel El Mida, the Late Villafranchian faulted alluvial deposits are overlain by complex lithofacies and growth patterns of spring-fed tufa and travertine. Travertine facies include travertine pinnacles, microterraces, thermal ponds, pisoids and conical structures, oncoids, microbial crusts, bacterial shrubs, microstromatolites, lithified bubbles (foam rocks) and microfans and cones. Their formation is controlled by (i) the volume of spring water and gas supplies and their respective daily, monthly or annual fluctuations, and (ii) topography and location with respect to the spring vent. The travertines highlight the predominance of physico-chemical processes over biochemical processes in their formation. In this context, water turbulence, temperature, and/or pressure changes are the dominant agents in releasing CO2. Tufa fades include rhizocretions and cushions, plant moulds and imprints, lithified terrestrial land snails, gyttja and paleosols. Their formation is linked to the dominance of biochemical processes over physio-chemical processes. In this context the amount of CO2 in calmer waters is regulated by photosynthesis, which indirectly regulates the rate of calcium carbonate precipitation. Gafsa strike-slip Fault, in addition to its tectonic role in creating fluid paths to the surface through flowing springs, acts as a major regional sill that controlled paleoflow directions, discharge locations, volume, rate and fluctuations of the water supply.

However, under natural conditions, the light intensity at the leaf level is always changing, inherently heterogeneous in time and space. Therefore, the effect of leaf N content on photosynthesis under dynamic light conditions needs further study. At present, the effects of leaf N content on leaf non-steady-state photosynthesis have not been reported in canola (Brassica napus L.). To clarify the relationship between leaf N content and the speed of the response leaf gas exchange to variations in light intensity, eight genotypes of canola varying in leaf N content were used to study the temporal response of gas exchange to a step increase in irradiance. We found there were significant differences in non-steady-state photosynthesis, physiological characteristics, and anatomical traits across genotypes (the maximum amplitude was about fivefold), despite the lack of contrast under normal, steady-state photosynthesis. In addition, initial stomatal conductance to water vapor in the darkness and leaf N content per leaf area were negatively correlated with the time required to achieve 50% and 100% of the maximum photosynthetic rate. Contrarily, the time required to reach 50% of the maximum stomatal conductance was positively correlated with the time required to achieve 90% of the maximum photosynthetic rate across genotypes. It is concluded that the genotypes of canola with higher N content per leaf area show a faster induction of photosynthesis to fluctuating light conditions.","[Liu, Jiahuan; Zhang, Jing; Luo, Tao; Hu, Liyong] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, MOA Key Lab Crop Ecophysiol & Farming Syst Middle, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Estavillo, Gonzalo M.] CSIRO Agr & Food, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Huazhong Agricultural University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)","Hu, LY (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, MOA Key Lab Crop Ecophysiol & Farming Syst Middle, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.","liyonghu@mail.hzau.edu.cn","Estavillo, Gonzalo/I-1774-2013; Liu, Jiahuan/GPG-4121-2022; liu, jiahuan/AAX-7102-2021; Zhang, Jing/GYE-1115-2022","Estavillo, Gonzalo/0000-0003-4634-5103; Liu, Jiahuan/0000-0001-8972-6112; liu, jiahuan/0000-0001-8972-6112; Zhang, Jing/0000-0001-8780-069X; Luo, Tao/0000-0001-6610-2438","Hubei Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project [2016 6200 0000 1045]; National Modern Rapeseed Industry Technology System [NYCYTC-00510]","Hubei Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project; National Modern Rapeseed Industry Technology System","Hubei Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project, Grant/Award Number: 2016 6200 0000 1045; National Modern Rapeseed Industry Technology System, Grant/Award Number: NYCYTC-00510",NA,"45","9","9","1","34","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0031-9317","1399-3054","","PHYSIOL PLANTARUM","Physiol.

Thus understanding the factors controlling fruit set including climate change is of importance for assessing the yield and its accurate prediction. This study assessed the survival pattern of female flowers produced in different months of the year, the effects of climate factors during early phase of flowering and the competition for assimilates from previously formed fruits on the fruit set of newly opening inflorescences in a 25 26 year-old coconut plantation in the Intermediate Zone (IL1a) of Sri Lanka over a period of three years. The rate of fruit survival since the onset of flowering to maturity varied with the month of inflorescence opening. Abortion of fruits after three months from inflorescence opening was negligible. The optimum (Topt-In vitro) and maximum (Tmax-in vitro) temperatures for in vitro pollen germination were 28 degrees C and 39.7 degrees C, respectively. The fruit set of an inflorescence/s opened in a given month (number of set fruits palm(-1) month(-1)) was negatively correlated with the total reproductive dry matter requirement of the palm (TDMR) of the month of inflorescence/s opening (first month), and the number of high temperature days (T-max >= 33 degrees C) during the first three months of inflorescence opening, whilst it was positively correlated with the number of female flowers produced in the inflorescence. There was a highly significant correlation between the monthly fruit set (at three month stage) and the corresponding harvested fruit yield palm(-1) month(-1). The lag period between flowering (opening of the female phase) and fruit maturing was eleven months.","[Ranasinghe, C. S.; Silva, L. R. S.; Premasiri, R. D.

Documenting the response of forests to present environmental changes will be very useful in developing and validating vegetation models that predict plant responses to global changes resulting from human activities. It is generally suggested that the expansion of the upper treeline is limited by cold temperatures, so warmer conditions are expected to induce an advance of forests into alpine vegetation. Significant changes in temperature and precipitation have already been documented in regional studies along the Patagonian Andes during the last decades. Across Patagonia, there are strong relationships between changes in climate and variations in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The atmospheric circulation indexes, act as climate packages summarizing climatic information since they combine changes in environmental variables. In order to complement previous studies in the northern Patagonia treeline, we have conducted a this study in the southern Patagonian Andes to: (1) characterize the patterns of Nothofagus pumilio establishment in the upper treeline along a precipitation gradient, (2) to establish the relationship between variations in regional climate and tree establishment and (3) to determine the influence of continental and hemispheric-scale climatic forcing on tree establishment at regional scale. Our studies suggest that the location of the upper treeline of the N. pumilio forest in the Patagonian Andes is sensitive to changes in climate variations. The temperature increment has facilitated the tree recruitment, however, the rate of seedling establishment appears to be more strongly modulated by the interaction between temperature increase and variations in precipitation. The expansion of the upper treeline has been limited to 5-10m from the abrupt treeline. This comparatively reduced advance of the forest in the alpine grassland is regulated by other biotic and abiotic factors rather than the temperature increase. While the recent expansion of the upper treeline in northern Patagonia was regulated by temperature and precipitation variations associated with the different phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the establishment above the upper treeline in the southern Patagonian Andes was facilitated by climatic variations induced by the positive trend of the SAM during the last decades.","[Srur, Ana M.; Villalba, Ricardo; Rodriguez-Caton, Milagros; Marcotti, Eugenia] CCT CONICET Mendoza, Inst Argentino Nivol Glaciol & Ciencias Ambiental, Mendoza, Argentina; [Amoroso, Mariano M.] Univ Nacl Rio Negro, Inst Invest Recursos Nat Agroecol & Desarrollo Ru, Sede Andina, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Amoroso, Mariano M.] CCT CONICET Patagonia Norte, San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Marcotti, Eugenia] Univ Nacl Jujuy, Inst Ecorreg Andinas CONICET UNJu, San Salvador De Jujuy, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","Srur, AM (corresponding author), CCT CONICET Mendoza, Inst Argentino Nivol Glaciol & Ciencias Ambiental, Mendoza, Argentina.","asrur@mendoza-conicet.gob.ar","Rodriguez-Caton, Milagros/GRE-8611-2022; Amoroso, Mariano/GPX-9214-2022","Rodriguez-Caton, Milagros/0000-0002-9608-0150; Srur, Ana M./0000-0001-8533-5296; Villalba, Ricardo/0000-0001-8183-0310","CONICET, Argentina","CONICET, Argentina(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET))","This study was partially supported by CONICET, Argentina.

Leaf morphology, photosynthesis, and photoprotection were characterized in two Arabidopsis ecotypes from near the limits of this species' latitudinal distribution in Europe (63A degrees N and 42A degrees N). The Swedish ecotype formed thicker leaves and upregulated photosynthesis more substantially than the Italian ecotype in high-light environments. Conversely, the smaller rosette formed, and lesser aboveground biomass accumulated, by the Swedish versus the Italian ecotype in low growth-light environments is consistent with a lesser shade tolerance of the Swedish ecotype. The response of the thinner leaves of the Italian ecotype to evenly spaced daily periods of higher light against a background of otherwise non-fluctuating low light was to perform the same rate of photosynthesis with less chlorophyll, rather than exhibiting greater rates of photosynthesis. In contrast, the thicker leaves of the Swedish ecotype showed elevated photosynthetic performance in response to daily supplemental higher light periods in a low-light growth environment. These findings suggest significant self-shading in the lower depths of leaves of the Swedish ecotype by the chloroplasts residing in the upper portions of the leaf, resulting in a requirement for higher incident light to trigger photosynthetic upregulation in the lower portions of its thicker leaves. Conversely, photoprotective responses in the Italian ecotype suggest that more excess light penetrated into the lower depths of this ecotype's leaves. It is speculated that light absorption and the degree of utilization of this absorbed light inform cellular signaling networks that orchestrate leaf structural development, which, in turn, affects light distribution and the level of absorbed versus photosynthetically utilized light in a leaf.","[Stewart, Jared J.; Adams, William W., III; Cohu, Christopher M.; Polutchko, Stephanie K.; Lombardi, Elizabeth M.; Demmig-Adams, Barbara] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder","Demmig-Adams, B (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.","barbara.demmig-adams@colorado.edu","Adams, William/R-2772-2019; Stewart, Jared J/S-5408-2017","Stewart, Jared J/0000-0002-0226-534X","National Science Foundation [DEB-1022236]; University of Colorado at Boulder; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [1022236] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Colorado at Boulder; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This study was funded by the National Science Foundation (Award Number DEB-1022236 to BD-A and WWA) and the University of Colorado at Boulder.",NA,"56","22","22","0","84","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0032-0935","1432-2048","","PLANTA","Planta","DEC","2015","242","6","",NA,"",NA,"1277","1290","","10.1007/s00425-015-2368-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-015-2368-3","","","14","Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences","CT8CM","26189001","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000363042600002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Annual whole plant production (953 +/- 136 g DW (dry weight) m(-2) yr(-1)) was calculated from monthly measurements of leaf and rhizome production made using marking techniques. Leaf growth exhibited a seasonal pattern; monthly production ranged from 8 to 95 g DW m(-2) mo(-1), equivalent to 614 +/- 71 g DW m(-2) yr(-1) Rhizome growth was seasonal, and areal below-ground production ranged between 14 and 40 g DW m(-2) mo(-1), equivalent to 339 +/- 65 g DW m(-2) yr(-1). On an annual basis, rhizome production accounted for 35% of total plant production. Seasonal leaf and rhizome growth patterns were correlated with underwater irradiance, daylength and temperature. Total biomass ranged between 750 and 1500 g DW m(-2), with below-ground tissues accounting for 80 to 90% of the total. There was no seasonal pattern in the belowground biomass of T, testudinum; variability was a result of environmental heterogeneity. Flowering was variable between years; 13 to 30% of the shoots flowered and about 15% of total above-ground biomass was allocated to reproduction. Flowering phenology was positively correlated with underwater daylength. During 1996, maximum fruit abundance ranged between 20 and 70 fruits m(-2) and on average each fruit contained 2 seeds. The annual flowering event represents a substantial resource (e.g, carbon and nitrogen) investment, which may influence individual plant production. Seasonal fluctuations in environmental parameters are the primary factors controlling seagrass growth rates and production.

Year to year fluctuations around the increasing yield trend were substantial (st.dev. 591 kg/ha) and were highly correlated negatively with annual fluctuations in the average Tmin January to March (Tmin J-M) which ranged from 5.0 to 11.5 degrees C in this period lasting from mid tillering to early-mid grain fill. Dividing the 60-year period into three consecutive 20-year periods and using multiple linear regression improved the accuracy of estimates of FY as a linear function of time in each period (responding inter alia to better technology including breeding and agronomy), with slopes of 4.5%, 0.6%, and 1.8% p.a. for 1960-79, 1980-99, and 2000-19, respectively. Tmin J-M coefficients were -218, -413, -406 kg/ha/degrees C, or -5.9, -8.1, -6.6%/degrees C, respectively, with R-2 always close to 0.9. Combining results, the FY response to Tmin J-M was close to -7%/degrees C, such that over the 60-year period the Tmin J-M increase of 1.0 degrees C contributed a 7% reduction in FY at constant CO2. The improved estimate of FY slopes with respect to time revealed novel variation across the 60 year period to be dissected in a following paper. Annual fluctuations in Tmax J-M were not correlated with variation in Tmin J-M nor with variation in FY. Crop simulation modelling of potential yield (PY) corroborated the negative effect of increased Tmin J-M on yield and suggested that increased Tmin J-M primarily decreased days to anthesis, biomass and number of grains (/m2). Measurements retrieved from long term well-managed experiments in the Valley under constant agronomy and cultivars confirmed all the above predicted responses to Tmin J-M. Our results align with the few published studies increasing crop night temperature in the critical period of around 30 days up to the end of anthesis when grains/m(2), and hence yield, was inversely related to rate of development. In the Yaqui Valley this was strongly associated with Tmin variation.

Therefore, overwintering strategies determine whether an exotic species from low latitudes can successfully invade middle- and high-latitude areas. In this study, we investigated the effects of nutrient and water drawdown on overwintering in an exotic aquatic plant from the tropical zone, Eichhornia crassipes, at the northern margin of its distribution in China. The population density, size of individuals, and the size and nitrogen concentration of overwintering organs (stem base) of E. crassipes that grew in high-nutrition water were greater than those that grew in low-nutrient water before winter. The overwinter survival rate of E. crassipes was significantly affected by the water level and nutrient. The thick and dense floating mat of E. crassipes can increase the temperature of water bodies; therefore, the overwinter survival rate of E. crassipes was higher in constant-water-level and high-nutrient treatment. In contrast, due to the loss of heat preservation provided by the floating mats and the low nitrogen concentration in the stem base, all individuals of E. crassipes died in constant-water-level and low-nutrient treatment. In the water-drawdown treatments, the stem base of E. crassipes was directly exposed to low-temperature air; therefore, the overwinter survival rate of E. crassipes was lower. Our results reveal that eutrophication can not only improve the competitiveness of E. crassipes but can also improve the survival rate of overwintering plants in temperate regions. Our study also suggests that removing nutrients from the water and regulating the water level can limit the invasion of E. crassipes in temperate and subtropical regions.","[Yu, Haihao; Dong, Xianru; Yu, Dan; Liu, Chunhua; Fan, Shufeng] Wuhan Univ, Coll Ecol, Natl Field Stn Freshwater Ecosyst Liangzi Lake, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China","Wuhan University","Fan, SF (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Coll Ecol, Natl Field Stn Freshwater Ecosyst Liangzi Lake, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.","fanran911@163.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31500295, 31170339]; Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2015ZX07503-005]; Special Foundation of National Science and Technology Basic Research [2013FY112300]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment; Special Foundation of National Science and Technology Basic Research","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31500295 and 31170339), the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (2015ZX07503-005), and the Special Foundation of National Science and Technology Basic Research (2013FY112300).",NA,"75","3","4","0","14","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-462X","","","FRONT PLANT SCI","Front.

The commercial success of the biological fixation of carbon in a consistent manner depends upon the availability of a robust microalgae strain. In the present work, we report the identification of a novel marine Nannochloris sp. through multiparametric photosynthetic evaluation. Detailed photobiological analysis of this strain has revealed a smaller functional antenna, faster relaxation kinetics of non-photochemical quenching, and a high photosynthetic rate with increasing light and temperatures. Furthermore, laboratory scale growth assessment demonstrated a broad range halotolerance of 10-70 parts per thousand (PPT) and high-temperature tolerance up to 45 degrees C. Such traits led to the translation of biomass productivity potential from the laboratory scale (0.2-3.0 L) to the outdoor 50,000 L raceway pond scale (500-m(2)) without any pond crashes. The current investigation revealed outdoor single-day peak areal biomass productivity of 43 g m(-2) d(-1) in summer with an annual (March 2019-February 2020) average productivity of 20 g m(-2) d(-1) in seawater. From a sustainability perspective, this is the first report of successful round-the-year (> 347 days) multi-season (summer, monsoon, and winter) outdoor cultivation of Nannochloris sp. in broad seawater salinity (1-57 PPT), wide temperature ranges (15-40 degrees C), and in fluctuating light conditions. Concurrently, outdoor cultivation of this strain demonstrated conducive fatty acid distribution, including increased unsaturated fatty acids in winter. This inherent characteristic might play a role in protecting photosynthesis machinery at low temperatures and in high light stress. Altogether, our marine Nannochloris sp. showed tremendous potential for commercial scale cultivation to produce biofuels, food ingredients, and a sustainable source for vegetarian protein.","[Paul, Kenny; Gaikwad, Mahadev; Pai, Puja; Patil, Smita D.; Pawar, Yogesh; Chawande, Akshay; Banerjee, Arun; Nagle, Vinod; Sapre, Ajit; Dasgupta, Santanu] Reliance Ind Ltd, Synthet Biol Res & Dev Grp, Reliance Corp Pk,Thane Belapur Rd, Navi Mumbai 400701, India; [Choudhary, Poonam; Mohan, Natarajan; Chelliah, Meenakshi] RIL Biofuel R&D Site, Motikhavadi Jamnagar, India","Reliance Industries","Banerjee, A (corresponding author), Reliance Ind Ltd, Synthet Biol Res & Dev Grp, Reliance Corp Pk,Thane Belapur Rd, Navi Mumbai 400701, India.","Arun.Banerjee@ril.com","Choudhary, Poonam/X-6008-2019","Choudhary, Poonam/0000-0002-2708-9741; BANERJEE, ARUN/0000-0002-9595-1049; Paul, Kenny/0000-0003-4948-765X","Reliance Industries Limited","Reliance Industries Limited","The authors are thankful to Reliance Industries Limited for the financial support.

Proportionally large and significant net seasonal mineralization of N, in contrast to non-significant P mineralization, was found in untransplanted and transplanted fellfield soil. In contrast, P was mineralized in proportionally large amounts, in contrast to low N mineralization, in the transplanted and untransplanted heath soil. The differences indicate that P was strongly immobilized in relation to N at the fellfield and that N was more strongly immobilized than P in the heath soil. The immobilization in both soils remained high even after a temperature change of 4-5-degrees-C experienced by transplanted soils. Air temperature increases of up to 4-5-degrees-C in greenhouses resulted in a soil temperature increase of 1-2-degrees-C and did not cause any extra increase of net N and P mineralization. The results suggest that soil temperature increases of up to 2-degrees-C, which are likely to occur by the end of the next century as an effect of a predicted 4-5-degrees-C rise in air temperature, have only small effects on net mineralization in at least two characteristic tundra soils. These effects are probably smaller than the natural fluctuation of plant available nutrients from site to site, even within the same plant community. A further soil temperature increase of up to 4-5-degrees-C may enhance decomposition and gross mineralization, but the rate of net mineralization, and hence the change of nutrient availability to the plants, depends on the extent of microbial immobilization of the extra nutrients released.","UNIV GOTEBORG,INST BOT,S-41319 GOTHENBURG,SWEDEN; INST TERRESTRIAL ECOL,MERLEWOOD RES STN,GRANGE SANDS LA11 6J4,CUMBRIA,ENGLAND","University of Gothenburg; UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH)","JONASSON, S (corresponding author), UNIV COPENHAGEN,INST BOT,DEPT PLANT ECOL,OSTER FARIMAGSGADE 2D,DK-1353 COPENHAGEN,DENMARK.","","Callaghan, Terens V./N-7640-2014","","","","",NA,"37","145","158","4","80","SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010","0029-8549","","","OECOLOGIA","Oecologia","AUG","1993","95","2","",NA,"",NA,"179","186","","10.1007/BF00323488","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00323488","","","8","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","LV564","28312940","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1993LV56400004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Water availability in the field can cyclically change between drought and rewatering conditions, depending on precipitation patterns. Concurrently, light intensity under field conditions can fluctuate, inducing dynamic photosynthesis and transpiration during the crop growth period. The present study aimed to characterize carbon gain and water use in fluctuating light under drought and rewatering conditions in two major crops, namely rice and soybean. We conducted gas exchange measurements under fluctuating light conditions with rice and soybean plants exposed to drought treatment (9-13 days) imposed by withholding water and subsequent rewatering treatment (8-9 days). Drought stress significantly reduced the maximum CO2 assimilation rate (A) in soybean but not in rice. Under drought conditions, A increased after a step increase in light and then gradually decreased in both crops, resulting in the significant reduction of steady-state A in rice and soybean. Moreover, drought stress delayed photosynthetic induction in both crops even when it had relatively small impact on maximum A. These results suggest that the drought effects on photosynthesis should be evaluated based on induction, maximum, and steady states. The delayed photosynthetic induction under drought owing to the reduced gas diffusional conductance via stomata resulted in a substantial loss of leaf carbon gain under fluctuating light conditions. Meanwhile, rewatering, after drought, completely recovered photosynthesis under fluctuating light in both crops. Therefore, the stability of photosynthetic induction can be a promising target to improve drought tolerance during crop breeding in the future.","[Sakoda, Kazuma; Yamori, Wataru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 1-1-1 Midori Cho, Nishitokyo, Tokyo 1880002, Japan; [Sakoda, Kazuma] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Chiyoda Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Taniyoshi, Kazuki; Tanaka, Yu] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto, Japan","University of Tokyo; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Kyoto University","Sakoda, K (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, 1-1-1 Midori Cho, Nishitokyo, Tokyo 1880002, Japan.","sakoda@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp","Yamori, Wataru/C-5680-2011; Tanaka, Yu/GQH-6268-2022","Yamori, Wataru/0000-0001-7215-4736; Tanaka, Yu/0000-0003-2106-4217","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) [20J00594]; Japan Science and Technology Agency, PRESTO [JPMJPR16Q5]; JSPS KAKENHI [16H06552, 18H02185, 18KK0170, 20H05687, 20H02968]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20H05687, 20J00594, 18H02185, 18KK0170, 20H02968] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Japan Science and Technology Agency, PRESTO(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)); JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported in part by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Research Fellow Grant Number: 20J00594 (to Kazuma Sakodaa), Japan Science and Technology Agency, PRESTO Grant Number: JPMJPR16Q5 (to Yu Tanakac), and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number: 16H06552, 18H02185, 18KK0170, and 20H05687 (to Wataru Yamoria), and 20H02968 (to Yu Tanakac).

The current hypothesis states that elevated atmospheric CO2 (e[CO2]) can compensate for the negative effects of water scarcity regarding leaf gas exchanges and coffee bean quality traits over the canopy vertical profile, in interactions with light and temperature microclimate during the two final stages of berry development. Responses of Coffea arabica L. were observed in the 5th year of a free air CO2 enrichment experiment (FACE) under water-limited rainfed conditions. The light dependent leaf photosynthesis curves (A/PAR) were modelled for leaves sampled from vertical profile divided into four 50-cm thick layers. e[CO2] significantly increased gross photosynthesis (A(maxGross)), the apparent quantum yield efficiency, light compensation point, light saturation point (LSP) and dark respiration rate (R-d). As a specific stage response, considering berry ripening, all parameters calculated from A/PAR were insensitive to leaf position over the vertical profile. Lack of a progressive increase in A(maxGross) and LSP was observed over the whole canopy profile in both stages, especially in the two lowest layers, indicating leaf plasticity to light. Negative correlation of R-d to leaf temperature (T-L) was observed under e[CO2] in both stages. Under e[CO2], stomatal conductance was also negatively correlated with T-L, reducing leaf transpiration and R-d even with increasing T-L. This indicated coffee leaf acclimation to elevated temperatures under e[CO2] and water restriction. The e[CO2] attenuation occurred under water restriction, especially in A and water use efficiency, in both stages, with the exception of the lowest two layers. Under e[CO2], coffee produced berries in moderate- and high light level layers, with homogeneous distribution among them, contrasted to the heterogeneous distribution under actual CO2. e[CO2] led to increased caffeine content in the highest layer, with reduction of chlorogenic acid and lipids under moderate light and to raised levels of sugar in the shaded low layer. The ability of coffee to respond to e[CO2] under limited soil water was expressed through the integrated individual leaf capacities to use the available light and water, resulting in final plant investments in new reproductive structures in moderate and high light level layers.","[Rakocevic, Miroslava; Souza, Guilherme A.

In high density microalgae cultures exposed to sunlight, the high pigment content leads to oversaturation of the photosystems resulting in increased light energy dissipation at the reactor surface, reducing the light use efficiency. In theory, therefore, pigment reduction would maximize biomass productivity. In this study, we have measured the long-term biomass productivity and short-term oxygen production rate of low-pigmented cells of Chlorella sorokiniana under mass culture conditions. Reduced pigmentation was obtained through the natural process of photoacclimation under high irradiance. During the time that the pigmentation was reduced, mass culture productivity, light absorption, and light use efficiency were investigated. Photoacclimation kinetics were investigated in a light shift experiment inwhich the increase in absorption cross section was followed in time upon a shift from high to low light intensity. Improved productivity of low-pigmented cells under mass culture conditions was not observed in any of the experiments. There is no solid explanation based on the experimental data. The most likely explanations are that thermal dissipation mechanisms were still activated and that the photoacclimation process itself consumed a substantial amount of energy at cost of growth processes. It is suggested that photoacclimation can only be exploited in the situation that microalgal cells are grown at a fixed position (e. g. in a biofilm, or multicompartment reactor) without being exposed to rapid light fluctuations.

Patelloida pygmaea is a low-zoned, sheltered-shore limpet with a lifespan of 1 year. C grata migrates up-shore in winter, but occurs lower on the shore in summer. This migration is synchronized with variations in algal availability high on the shore; such variations are, however, themselves related to seasonal changes in wave height. P. pygmaea is restricted to the low shore, year round. The movements upwards in winter and downwards in summer are still evident. Algal species richness increased from September to reach a peak between December and March, and to abruptly diminish between May and June. The encrusting algae Brachytrichia maculans, Hildenbrandia prototypus, Lithothamnion sp. and Ralfsia verrucosa were present year round. The timing of juvenile recruitment of C. grata and P. pygmaea was from October to July and February to October, respectively. Temperature may be important in enhancing juvenile survival by affecting the seasonal pattern of algal occurrence on the shore. Seasonal fluctuations in the rate of growth were recorded for both species with the time of fastest growth of C. grata and P. pygmaea occurring between October and March and September and February, respectively. Mortality of both species occurred mainly in summer.

The area of reproduction of this species is very wide in the Adriatic since the anchovy will spawn anywhere down to the depth of 200 m. However the main spawning area is in the eutrophic waters of the western part of the shallow northern Adriatic and along the Italian coast to the peninsula of Gargano. Anchovy spawn in the Adriatic generally from April to October, in the temperature and salinity ranges of 11.6 - 27.6 degrees C and 9.1 - 39.6 ppt, respectively. Developmental times of Adriatic anchovy eggs and larvae, as well as the growth curves of larvae and postlarvae, were estimated ender experimental conditions. The growth curves of postlarvae were also estimated from otolith readings. Biomass assessments of Adriatic anchovy by means of egg production method was made possible by the known temperature-development relationships, as well as the knowledge of the residence times of particular developmental stages. Spawning biomass was estimated in the northern and middle Adriatic during the period from 1976 to 1990. Detailed investigations of long-term fluctuations of anchovy egg production, quantity of larvae and postlarvae, as well as of instantaneous mortality rates of postlarvae, were performed in the middle Adriatic for the period from 1962 to 1976. Fluctuations of egg production and larval abundance were found positively correlated with fluctuations of temperature, salinity, primary production and zooplankton quantity, with a lag of one year. As eutrophication particularly affected the shallow northern Adriatic and the zone along the Italian coast as far as the peninsula of Gargano, it seems that this phenomenon negatively affected the reproduction of the anchovy in its main spawning areas.","","","Regner, S (corresponding author), INST MARINE BIOL, POB 69, YU-85330 KOTOR, YUGOSLAVIA.","","","","","","",NA,"66","90","92","0","5","CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC","MADRID","VITRUVIO 8, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN","0214-8358","1886-8134","","SCI MAR","Sci.

Thus substrate was held constant while climate varied. Trees from montane climates had higher leaf mass per unit cross-sectional area of sapwood (functional conducting xylem) than trees from desert climates, suggesting that a functional response to differences in climate had occurred. Our results also indicate that sapwood mass:leaf mass ratios of P. ponderosa may increase approximate to 50% with a 5 degrees C change in mean growing-season temperature, approximately the difference between our montane and desert sites. High proportional allocation of biomass to sapwood may improve water relations of P. ponderosa, but because sapwood contains living parenchyma, respiratory costs may be high. Site-specific regression equations were used to calculate aboveground biomass allocation for simulated montane and desert trees with the same diameter at breast height, dbh. Simulated montane trees were 46-52% taller than desert trees, and montane trees 10 cm in dbh had twice the total aboveground mass of desert counterparts. Simulated 50-cm montane and desert trees were almost identical in total mass, even though the montane tree was 46% taller. The predicted proportion of biomass allocated to bole sapwood increased with size for both montane and desert models; however, the 50-cm desert model contained 8% more total sapwood mass than the taller montane model. Total biomass of branches was similar for paired models of all size classes; however, biomass of primary and secondary branches differed considerably. The 50-cm desert model had twice as much biomass in primary branches in comparison to the montane model, whereas the montane model had 3 times more biomass in secondary branches than the desert model. For 10-cm trees of the desert and montane models 29 and 33% of the biomass were leaves, respectively. In larger trees, leaf allocation decreased to 5 and 7% for desert and montane models, respectively. The effects of climate on biomass allocation, such as reported here, and corresponding changes in whole-plant assimilation rates must be incorporated into growth-response models used to predict future fluctuations in forest productivity due to global climate change.","UNIV ILLINOIS, URBANA, IL 61801 USA; DUKE UNIV, DEPT BOT, DURHAM, NC 27708 USA; DUKE UNIV, DEPT GEOL, DURHAM, NC 27708 USA","University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Duke University; Duke University","","","","","","","",NA,"35","130","144","2","31","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0012-9658","1939-9170","","ECOLOGY","Ecology","JUL","1994","75","5","",NA,"",NA,"1474","1481","","10.2307/1937470","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1937470","","","8","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","NV662",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1994NV66200025","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, further decomposition and reciprocal reaction of monosaccharides and amino acids are usually accompanied with hydrothermal treatment, which have negative impacts on microbial fermentation performance. In this study, glucose and glycine were used as model substrates during hydrothermal treatment coupled with semi-continuous hydrogen and methane fermentation. The results showed that thermal decomposition of glucose was stronger than glycine, due to the binary interactions between carbonyl group and amino group. Acidic condition could suppress conversion of intermediate compounds to polymers, thereby improving 5-HMF concentration to 7.59 g/L. Hydrothermal by-products had adverse impacts on hydrogen fermentation stability, resulting in a wide fluctuation of hydrogen production rate of around 0.55 L/L/d. Adding sulfuric acid for treatment would increase the competition of sulphate reducing bacteria, and cause a stuck methane fermentation. Additionally, by-products degradation promoted the growth of hydrogenotrophic and mixotrophic methanogens. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigated effects of 2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl)-pyridine (Nitrapyrin, NP) on N2O emissions, and characterized the ammonia oxidizing microbial community in three arable soils typical of northern China. In alluvial, black, and paddy soils, average N2O emission rates were increased by addition of urea by 3.5, 0.7 and 2.1 mu M N2O g(-1) soil h(-1), respectively, but were reduced by 2.9, 0.4 and 2.2 mu M N2O g(-1) soil h(-1) when urea was applied with NP. The stimulation and suppression of N2O emission by urea and NP occurred alongside fluctuation in the growth of AOB in alluvial and paddy soils (P < 0.01). Weak stimulation and suppression of N2O emissions by urea and NP corresponded with weak effects on AOB abundances in the black soil. Changes in N2O emissions were not significantly correlated with AOA abundances in any of the three soils. The results showed that differential responses of N2O emission to urea and NP application in arable soils can be mainly explained by differences in growth of ammonia oxidizing bacteria.

We investigated the physiological, biochemical and gene expression changes in floral development and in response to temperature treatment (heat and chilling stress). Male floral buds showed more adverse effects than female floral buds under temperature treatment. Temperature treatment experiments revealed that temperature treatment significantly increased catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activities and transcription of related genes in female floral buds, whereas malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly increased only in males. Soluble sugars and protein increased both in female and male floral buds but were higher in males. Temperature treatment also caused significant increases in Ca2+ content and transcription of genes related to calcium transport in female flowers. These results revealed sex-specific floral developmental responses to seasonal temperature transitions and suggest that in Populus tomentosa, female floral buds possess better mechanisms for environment adaptation than do males.","[Song, Yuepeng; Ma, Kaifeng; Ci, Dong; Zhang, Zhiyi; Zhang, Deqiang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Natl Engn Lab Tree Breeding, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Song, Yuepeng; Ma, Kaifeng; Ci, Dong; Zhang, Zhiyi; Zhang, Deqiang] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Key Lab Genet & Breeding Forest Trees & Ornamenta, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Beijing Forestry University; Beijing Forestry University","Zhang, DQ (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Technol, Natl Engn Lab Tree Breeding, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.","DeqiangZhang@bjfu.edu.cn","Song, Yuepeng/T-8731-2019; zhang, ZY/HJH-6535-2023","","Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities [TD2012-01]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [30872042, 31170622]","Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by grants from the following sources: Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (No. TD2012-01), Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 30872042, 31170622).

Developmental instability (the error in development caused by stress) may provide an index of the adaptability of woody plants to withstand climatic stressors such as water shortage. This study evaluated the effects of drought stress on growth variables in three stands of a Mediterranean oak (Quercus faginea) exposed to differing climatic conditions (xeric, mesic and cooler) along an altitudinal gradient in northeastern Spain, in two climatically contrasting years (wet and dry years). Two indices of developmental instability, fluctuating and translational asymmetries, which reflect environmental stress, were measured in leaves and current-year shoots, respectively. We also measured branch biomass and fractal complexity of branches as indicators of the species' performance. After a period of drought the individuals' at the most xeric site presented lower developmental instability and less branch biomass than did the individuals from the mesic and cooler sites. We interpret that difference as an adaptive response to drought which reflects a trade-off between maintenance of homeostasis and growth when water is scarce. The study demonstrated that developmental instability constitutes a useful index to assess the degree of adaptation to stressful environmental conditions. The assessment of developmental instability in sites and years with contrasting climatic conditions provides a means of quantifying the capacity of plants to develop plastic adaptive responses to climatic stress.

The projected increase in winter temperatures under climate change could affect overwinter survival, timing of spring emergence and, ultimately, the severity of this pest. 2 We assessed the potential effects of warmer winters in field experiments performed in three consecutive years. Three warming levels were applied: (i) heated approximately 4 degrees C above ambient; (ii) unheated with snow cover left intact; and (iii) unheated with snow cover removed. Survival and date of emergence were assessed in all years, and beetle lipid content was analyzed in 1 year to determine rates of energy use. 3 Overwinter survival was 6.5-14.5% among years. Winter warming inconsistently affected overwinter survival: increasing survival in one winter, decreasing survival in the warmest winter and having no effect in one winter. Beetles that received supplemental winter warming emerged approximately 2 weeks earlier in spring, and lipid content did not differ among treatment groups. 4 Earlier spring emergence may allow for the production of an additional generation per year of C. trifurcata under future climate change. However, further experiments are required to establish the relationship between overwinter survival and subsequent beetle population growth to determine potential pest status and best management practices under future climate conditions.","[Berzitis, Emily A.; Hager, Heather A.; Hallett, Rebecca H.; Newman, Jonathan A.] Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; [Sinclair, Brent J.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada; [Hager, Heather A.; Newman, Jonathan A.] Univ Guelph, Dept Integrat Biol, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","University of Guelph; Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Guelph","Newman, JA (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Environm Sci, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.","jonathan.newman@uoguelph.ca","Hager, Heather/A-2984-2014; Newman, Jonathan/A-5932-2008","Hager, Heather/0000-0002-0066-6844; Newman, Jonathan/0000-0003-3155-4084","HQP scholarship; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","HQP scholarship; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR)","We thank Christopher Guglielmo for use of the TLC-FID and Katie Marshall for technical assistance with the analyses.

It is a clonal plant with an apparently irregular pattern of flowering events. An extensive bibliographic review allowed the reconstruction of past flowering events of this species around the Mediterranean, with a high degree of confidence for the last 30 years. The data series on annual flowering prevalence (FP, flowering records per total records) and flowering intensity (FI, fraction of flowering shoots) produced have been compared with four series on Sea Surface annual Temperature maxima (SSTmax) obtained for the NW Mediterranean (averaged from the local data series of l'Estartit and Villefranche: 1957-2005) and for the Eastern, Western basin and the whole Mediterranean sea (extracted from NCEP Reynolds interpolated SST maps: 1982-2005). Significant warming trends are detected in the Mediterranean SSTmax series, at a rate of (mean+SE) 0.04 +/- 0.01 degrees C yr(-1) (R-2=0.24, P < 0.01, N=24 years), in the Eastern basin series (0.06 +/- 0.01 degrees C yr(-1), R-2=0.43, P < 0.001, N=24 years) and in the long SSTmax series of the NW Mediterranean (0.02 +/- 0.01 C yr(-1), R-2=0.12, P < 0.02, N=49 years). The magnitudes of the SSTmax anomalies around the absolute warming trend do not increase with time in any SSTmax series. Peaks of FP and FI in the Mediterranean seem to occur each 9-11 years, and coincide with peaks of annual SSTmax. Annual FP and FI increase with the residuals of annual SSTmax warming trend in all Mediterranean basins (FPMED: R-2=0.27, P < 0.01, N=23; FPNW: R-2=0.34, P < 0.01, N=31; FPE: R-2=0.20; P < 0.10, N=23). An outstanding event of P. oceanica flowering across the Mediterranean has been registered in Autumn 2003; 1 month after the highest annual SSTmax recorded in the series. The hypothesis of flowering induction by thermal stress as the possible cause of this relationship is discussed, as well as the potential use of P. oceanica flowering record as early indicator of biological change induced by global sea warming in Mediterranean marine ecosystems.","UIB, CSIC, IMEDEA, Grp Oceanog Interdisciplinar, Esporles 07190, Spain","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao; Universitat de les Illes Balears","Diaz-Almela, E (corresponding author), UIB, CSIC, IMEDEA, Grp Oceanog Interdisciplinar, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Spain.","elena.diaz-almela@uib.es","Marbà, Nuria/N-8143-2019; Marba, Nuria/H-8136-2015; Duarte Quesada, Carlos Manuel/ABD-6208-2021; Duarte, Carlos M/A-7670-2013","Marbà, Nuria/0000-0002-8048-6789; Marba, Nuria/0000-0002-8048-6789; Duarte, Carlos M/0000-0002-1213-1361; Diaz-Almela, Elena/0000-0002-5904-3297","","","",NA,"66","128","131","9","53","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1354-1013","1365-2486","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL","Glob.

Little is known about its response to the combination of salinity and flooding (hypoxia) stresses. This study is an attempt to characterize the physiological response of Miswak to the combination of these two stresses in situ. We examined functional leaf traits, osmotic adjustment, gas exchange rates, chlorophyll a fluorescence and lipid peroxidation. Under stressful conditions, this species was able to shift from fast to slow growth and adjust its gas exchange rates in order to reduce water loss and limit the upward transport of toxic ions. In saline-dry(S) and saline-flooded (S-F) habitats stomatal conductance (g(s)) and stomatal density (SD) decreased as Na accumulated in the leaves. In contrast, in non-saline-flooded (NS-F) habitats SD increased. Na+ and K+ contributed greatly to leaf osmotic potential (Psi(pi)), especially under the combined effects of salinity and flooding. Proline concentrations increased too in root and leaf tissues possibility to protect macromolecules against the rising Na+ concentration. Furthermore, photorespiration and cyclic electron transport appear to have been upregulated in non-saline-flooded habitats and appear to play a protective role. However under prolonged saline stress, thermal dissipation was involved in PSII protection but not photo-inhibition. Still under saline and saline-flooded habitats, plants were able to reduce the flow of electrons through photosystems. Under saline-flooded habitats plants experience oxidative stress leading to photo-damage. A combination of morphological (smaller leaves) and physiological (accumulation of Na+ and K+ in the leaves) adjustments and increased osmo- (accumulation of proline) and photo- (reduction in chlorophyll content, increased non-photochemical quenching and reduced Photochemical quenching (q(p)) and linear electron transport rate) protection helped the plant overcome salinity, hypoxia and their combination in its native habitats.

We addressed two research questions in this study: (i) Does the relative abundance of individual copepod species life history stages differ across warm and cold periods and (ii) Do estimated secondary production rates for copepods differ across warm and cold periods? For most copepod species, warmer conditions resulted in increased abundances in May, the opposite was observed in colder conditions. Abundances of smaller-sized copepod species did not differ significantly between the warm and cold periods, whereas abundances of larger-sized Calanus spp. increased during the cold period during July and September. Estimated secondary production rates in the warm period were highest in May for smaller-sized copepods; production in the cold period was dominated by the larger-sized Calanus spp. in July and September. We hypothesize that these observed patterns are a function of temperature-driven changes in phenology combined with shifts in size-based trophic relationships with primary producers. Based on this hypothesis, we present a conceptual model that builds upon the Oscillating Control Hypothesis to explain how variability in copepod production links to pollock variability. Specifically, fluctuations in spring sea-ice drive regime-dependent copepod production over the southeastern Bering Sea, but greatest impacts to upper trophic levels are driven by cascading July/September differences in copepod production.","[Kimmel, David G.; Eisner, Lisa B.; Wilson, Matthew T.; Duffy-Anderson, Janet T.] NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","Kimmel, DG (corresponding author), NOAA, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.","david.kimmel@noaa.gov","Kimmel, David/AFM-9673-2022; Kimmel, David G./N-1148-2019","Kimmel, David/0000-0001-7232-7801; ","","","",NA,"111","32","32","0","31","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1054-6006","1365-2419","","FISH OCEANOGR","Fish Oceanogr.","MAR","2018","27","2","",NA,"",NA,"143","158","","10.1111/fog.12241","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fog.12241","","","16","Fisheries; Oceanography","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Fisheries; Oceanography","FV9FQ",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000424893400004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The rheophytic type of S. rubropunctata showed relatively simultaneous germination times and reached high germination rates under all temperatures tested. This characteristic may allow it to establish quickly without being influenced by temperature, giving a survival advantage in rheophytic habitats by avoiding seeds being washed away by the rising water. In contrast, the final germination rate of the terrestrial type of S. rubropunctata, as well as that of the congener S. indica var. parvifolia, was highest at 15 degrees C and declined drastically at 30 degrees C. Seeds of both of these plants that remained ungerminated at higher temperatures germinated soon after the temperature was changed to 15 degrees C, indicating that the germination suppression was a state of enforced dormancy that was released after transfer to the optimal temperature. These characteristics suggest an asynchronous germination which is thought to reduce the risk of disturbance in fluctuating environments. Our study may be the first to demonstrate the differentiation of seed germination characteristics in relation to adaptations to a rheophytic habitat. Because rheophytes occupy such a harsh environment under strong selective pressure, the adaptive differentiation of seed germination characteristics may occur in many other rheophytes.","[Yoshimura, Hikaru; Arakaki, Shogo] Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, Senbaru 1, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Hamagawa, Mikoto; Kitamura, Yoshio; Yokota, Masatsugu; Denda, Tetsuo] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Lab Ecol & Systemat, Senbaru 1, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan","University of the Ryukyus; University of the Ryukyus","Denda, T (corresponding author), Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Lab Ecol & Systemat, Senbaru 1, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan.","denda@sci.u-ryukyu.ac.jp","","","JSPS KAKENHI [17K07539]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [17K07539] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Seed sampling at Hiji River was conducted with the permission of Kunigami Village, Okinawa Prefecture.

More recent studies of population dynamics and paleoenvironmental reconstructions in arid environments have revealed the more dynamic nature of desert vegetation, in both a short-term and long-term perspective. This paper examines relationships of population dynamics to climatic fluctuation and anthropogenic factors in two columnar cactus species in the northern Sonoran Desert. The results underscore the responsiveness of desert plant populations to temporal variability in environmental stresses as well as the influence of temporal scale on our views of population dynamics. I use allometrically determined ages for 327 organ pipe cacti on hillslopes and 473 saguaros on flat sites in Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Arizona, to relate regeneration trends for each species to climatic variation in the last century. Residuals representing the deviation of the actual age distribution from a hypothetical distribution, based on constant age-specific survivorship rates, serve as the dependent variable in regression models that quantify regeneration trends. Until the 1960s the trends for both species were similar; episodes of establishment corresponded to relatively wet periods with mild winters, and poor regeneration coincided with prolonged drought. Regeneration steadily declined through the 1960s in saguaro and remained relatively high in organ pipe cactus. The occurrence of several severe freezes, intense grazing, or a combination of these two factors during this decade may have affected flat sites and hillslopes differentially. Flats supporting saguaro were more intensely grazed and often experience lower winter minimum temperatures than hillslopes supporting organ pipe cactus.

The influence of the initial cell density in the beads and of salinity on algal growth was first investigated. The potential of the proposed bioassay was evaluated by comparing laboratory with in situ results. A good growth performance of P. tricornutum was observed at all starting densities of beads. Although the growth rate of P. tricornutum was significantly affected by salinity, acceptability criteria currently adopted in algal assays were met, indicating the suitability of P. tricornutum as a test species for bioassays in estuaries. The large differences observed between the laboratory and in situ responses of P. tricornutum were most probably due to the temperature and light conditions less favorable for algal growth in the field and to the lack of representativeness of water samples compared to the field fluctuating conditions. These results showed the need for in situ assessments, especially in estuarine environments influenced by tides. To a lesser extent, the bioassay itself may also have been responsible for the laboratory and field differences, Further improvements in the bioassay chambers and procedures were also discussed.","Univ Coimbra, Inst Ambiente & Vida, Dept Zool, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal; CSIC, Inst Ciencias Marinas Andalucia, Cadiz 11510, Spain; Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal","Universidade de Coimbra; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Ciencias Marinas de Andalucia (ICMAN); Universidade de Aveiro","Ribeiro, R (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Inst Ambiente & Vida, Dept Zool, Largo Marques Pombal, P-3004517 Coimbra, Portugal.","rui.ribeiro@zoo.uc.pt","dos Santos, Margarida MPC/H-7897-2012; Ribeiro, Rui/C-7788-2012; Soares, Amadeu/A-8304-2008; Gonçalves, Fernando J.

The aim of this experiment was to examine the impact of natural vegetation restoration and long-term fertilization on the seasonal pattern of soil respiration and cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from a black soil of northeast China. Soil respiration rate fluctuated greatly during the growing season in grassland (GL), ranging from 278 to 1030mg CO2 m-2h-1 with an average of 606mg CO2 m-2h-1. By contrast, soil CO2 emission did not change in bareland (BL) as much as in GL. For cropland (CL), including three treatments [CK (no fertilizer application), nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium application (NPK), and NPK together with organic manure (OM)], soil CO2 emission gradually increased with the growth of maize after seedling with an increasing order of CK NPM OM, reaching a maximum on 17 August and declining thereafter. A highly significant exponential correlation was observed between soil temperature and soil CO2 emission for GL during the late growing season (from 3 August to 28 September) with Q10 = 2.46, which accounted for approximately 75% of emission variability. However, no correlation was found between the two parameters for BL and CL. Seasonal CO2 emission from rhizosphere soil changed in line with the overall soil respiration, which averaged 184, 407, and 584mg CO2 m-2h-1, with peaks at 614, 1260, and 1770mg CO2 m-2h-1 for CK, NPK, and OM, respectively. SOM-derived CO2 emission of root free-soil, including basal soil respiration and plant residue-derived microbial decomposition, averaged 132, 132, and 136mg CO2 m-2h-1, respectively, showing no difference for the three CL treatments. Cumulative soil CO2 emissions decreased in the order OM GL NPK CK BL. The cumulative rhizosphere-derived CO2 emissions during the growing season of maize in cropland accounted for about 67, 74, and 80% of the overall CO2 emissions for CK, NPK, and OM, respectively. Cumulative CO2 emissions were found to significantly correlate with SOC stocks (r = 0.92, n = 5, P 0.05) as well as with SOC concentration (r = 0.97, n = 5, P 0.01). We concluded that natural vegetation restoration and long-term application of organic manure substantially increased C sequestration into soil rather than C losses for the black soil. These results are of great significance to properly manage black soil as a large C pool in northeast China.","[Xing, Baoshan] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Plant Soil & Insect Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Li, Haibo; Han, Xiaozeng; Qiao, Yunfa; Hou, Xueying] Chinese Acad Sci, NE Inst Geog & Agroecol, Natl Field Res Stn Agroecosyst Hailun, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Li, Haibo; Hou, Xueying] Chinese Acad Sci, Grad Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China","University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Xing, BS (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Plant Soil & Insect Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.","xzhan@neigaehrb.ac.cn; bx@pssci.umass.edu","Xing, Baoshan/AAE-7826-2019","","Chinese Academy of Sciences [KZCX2-YW-407]; Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province, China [GB06B107-2]; Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station [MAS00860]","Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province, China; Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station","This work was supported in part by a grant from the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KZCX2-YW-407), the Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province, China (GB06B107-2), and the Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station (Project No. MAS00860).",NA,"40","22","30","4","66","TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","0010-3624","1532-2416","","COMMUN SOIL SCI PLAN","Commun.

P. fruticosa is an eastern Mediterranean malacophyllous plant dominating the so called ''phryganic'' ecosystem in Greece (synonym to coastal sage in California and garrigue in France). Maximum photosynthetic rates (c.a. 30 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) were observed during the spring, with a secondary maximum at late autumn, a deep minimum during summer and early autumn and a secondary minimum during mid-winter. The deep minimum (c.a. 2-3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) coincided with minimal shoot water potentials and a well-developed stomatal regulation of excessive water loss and CO2 assimilation. Photosynthesis, however,was additionally limited during the dry period by a substantial drop in photosynthetic capacity, as judged by CO2 exchange measurements at saturated (5 %) CO2. The secondary minimum in photosynthesis during mid-winter, occurring at a period of relatively high pre-dawn shoot water potentials and low atmospheric evaporative demand, was partly related to low temperatures in a rather indirect way. Indeed, diurnal changes in shoot water potential revealed a characteristic delay in the replacement of evaporated water at low temperatures, leading to leaf water shortage and stomatal closure, even during the wet period. We may conclude, therefore, that growth in P. fruticosa is restricted by low water potentials during the warm dry period and, possibly, by increased hydraulic resistance when the winter temperatures fall to relatively low values.","UNIV PATRAS,DEPT BIOL,PLANT PHYSIOL LAB,GR-26500 PATRAI,GREECE","University of Patras","","","Kyparissis, Aris/G-6010-2017","Kyparissis, Aris/0000-0002-3156-4963","","","",NA,"31","25","25","0","8","GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG JENA","JENA","VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY","0367-2530","","","FLORA","Flora","JAN","1995","190","1","",NA,"",NA,"71","78","","10.1016/S0367-2530(17)30627-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0367-2530(17)30627-8","","","8","Plant Sciences; Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","QF048",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1995QF04800005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Factors such as unfavorable environmental conditions, stress regulatory networks, and plant biochemical processes limits the photosynthetic efficiency of plants and thereby threaten food security worldwide. Although numerous physiological approaches have been used to assess the performance of key photosynthetic components and their stress responses, though, these approaches are not extensive enough and do not favor strategic improvement of photosynthesis under abiotic stresses. The decline in photosynthetic capacity of plants due to these stresses is directly associated with reduction in yield. Therefore, a detailed information of the plant responses and better understanding of the photosynthetic machinery could help in developing new crop plants with higher yield even under stressed environments. Interestingly, cracking of signaling and metabolic pathways, identification of some key regulatory elements, characterization of potential genes, and phytohormone responses to abiotic factors have advanced our knowledge related to photosynthesis. However, our understanding of dynamic modulation of photosynthesis under dramatically fluctuating natural environments remains limited. Here, we provide a detailed overview of the research conducted on photosynthesis to date, and highlight the abiotic stress factors (heat, salinity, drought, high light, and heavy metal) that limit the performance of the photosynthetic machinery. Further, we reviewed the role of transcription factor genes and various enzymes involved in the process of photosynthesis under abiotic stresses. Finally, we discussed the recent progress in the field of biodegradable compounds, such as chitosan and humic acid, and the effect of melatonin (bio-stimulant) on photosynthetic activity. Based on our gathered researched data set, the logical concept of photosynthetic regulation under abiotic stresses along with improvement strategies will expand and surely accelerate the development of stress tolerance mechanisms, wider adaptability, higher survival rate, and yield potential of plant species.","[Muhammad, Izhar; Yang, Qing-Hua; Li, Feng Bai] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol & Areas, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Muhammad, Izhar; Shalmani, Abdullah] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Life Sci, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol Arid Areas, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ali, Muhammad] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Hort, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Ahmad, Husain] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Hort, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; Zhejiang University; Northwest A&F University - China","Li, FB (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Agron, State Key Lab Crop Stress Biol & Areas, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.","fengbaili@nwsuaf.edu.cn","Ali, Muhammad/N-6660-2014; Ahmad, Husain/U-6438-2018","Ali, Muhammad/0000-0003-4606-5064; Ahmad, Husain/0000-0003-0955-3683","National Millet Crops Research and Development System [CARS-06-A26]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31371529]; National Science and Technology Supporting Plan [2014BAD07B03]; Program for the Key Science and Technology in Shaanxi Province [S2018-YF-TSLNY-0005]; Minor Grain Crops Research","National Millet Crops Research and Development System; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Science and Technology Supporting Plan; Program for the Key Science and Technology in Shaanxi Province; Minor Grain Crops Research","We acknowledge the funding agencies, the study was supported by National Millet Crops Research and Development System (CARS-06-A26), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31371529), National Science and Technology Supporting Plan (2014BAD07B03), and Program for the Key Science and Technology in Shaanxi Province (S2018-YF-TSLNY-0005) and Minor Grain Crops Research.",NA,"370","63","66","65","273","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-462X","","","FRONT PLANT SCI","Front.

Comparative proteomic and biochemical analysis were done for pooled berry populations (HrB13 and HrB14) growing in two different environmental conditions. HrB13, growing under sub-optimal environmental conditions exhibited differential abundance of stress responsive proteins, which were the rate limiting enzymes associated with stress-responsive metabolic pathways, including Xanthine dehydrogenase (reactive oxygen species [ROS] signaling), Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (phenylpropanoid pathway), endosomal BRO-1 domain protein (ultraviolet [UV]-light stress), Phosphofructokinase (sugar metabolism) and Ubiquitin thioesterase (protein alterations). Biochemical investigations showed a positive correlation between proteomic plasticity (HrB13) and 1.6 to 15-fold accumulation of downstream adaptive metabolic signatures like enzymes and antioxidants involved in ROS scavenging pathways (Catalase, Ascorbate peroxidase, Glutathione reductase, ascorbate and glutathione content), secondary metabolites (phenolics, flavonoids, carotenoids) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (proportional to - linolenic acid and linoleic acid). Interactome and KEGG pathway analysis also supported interactions of differentially accumulated proteins with stress-responsive signaling components involved in physiological pathways associated with stress tolerance. This is the first 'ecophysiolomics' study, showing the response of seabuckthorn to multiple stress conditions via activation of multifactorial acclimation strategies leading to morphological, metabolic and physiological modifications, resulting in dark orange berries in HrB13. Higher accumulation of omega-6 fatty acids, carotenoids and ascorbate during suboptimal growth conditions, provides exciting prospects for enhancing pharmaceutical properties of seabuckthorn berries, emphasizing need to analyze diversity of plant signaling mechanisms under changing climate conditions.","[Sharma, Bhavana; Deswal, Renu] Univ Delhi, Dept Bot, Mol Physiol & Prote Lab, Delhi 110007, India","University of Delhi","Deswal, R (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Dept Bot, Mol Physiol & Prote Lab, Delhi 110007, India.","rdeswal@botany.du.ac.in","Deswal, Renu/P-7051-2019","Deswal, Renu/0000-0002-7298-1050","Research and Development Grant (University of Delhi) [2015-16/D.U.] Funding Source: Medline; Department of Biotechnology [IBSD/A1/P(PH-2)/4] Funding Source: Medline; UGC-BSR and DBT Funding Source: Medline","Research and Development Grant (University of Delhi); Department of Biotechnology; UGC-BSR and DBT","",NA,"62","2","2","0","16","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0031-9317","1399-3054","","PHYSIOL PLANTARUM","Physiol.

Increasing winter temperatures and wide temperature fluctuations are leading to more frequent rain-on-snow events and freeze-thaw cycles causing snow compaction and formation of ice layers in the snowpack, thus creating ice encasement (IE). By decreasing the snowpack insulation capacity and restricting soil-atmosphere gas exchange, modification of the snow properties may lead to colder soil but also to hypoxia and accumulation of trace gases in the subnivean environment. To test the effects of these overwintering conditions changes on plant winter survival and growth, we established a snow manipulation experiment in a coniferous forest in Northern Finland with Norway spruce and Scots pine seedlings. In addition to ambient conditions and prevention of IE, we applied three snow manipulation levels: IE created by artificial rain-on-snow events, snow compaction and complete snow removal. Snow removal led to deeper soil frost during winter, but no clear effect of IE or snow compaction done in early winter was observed on soil temperature. Hypoxia and accumulation of CO2 were highest in the IE plots but, more importantly, the duration of CO2 concentration above 5% was 17 days in IE plots compared to 0 days in ambient plots. IE was the most damaging winter condition for both species, decreasing the proportion of healthy seedlings by 47% for spruce and 76% for pine compared to ambient conditions. Seedlings in all three treatments tended to grow less than seedlings in ambient conditions but only IE had a significant effect on spruce growth. Our results demonstrate a negative impact of winter climate change on boreal forest regeneration and productivity. Changing snow conditions may thus partially mitigate the positive effect of increasing growing season temperatures on boreal forest productivity.","[Martz, Francoise; Vuosku, Jaana; Ovaskainen, Anu; Stark, Sari; Rautio, Pasi] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Rovaniemi, Finland; [Stark, Sari] Univ Lapland, Arctic Ctr, Rovaniemi, Finland","Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Lapland","Martz, F (corresponding author), Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Rovaniemi, Finland.","francoise.martz@luke.fi","Rautio, Pasi/A-6595-2013; Martz, Francoise/C-6354-2017; Stark, Sari/L-4440-2013","Rautio, Pasi/0000-0003-0559-7531; Martz, Francoise/0000-0002-5693-4529","Suomen akatemia [267092]; Suomen Kulttuurirahasto, Lapin Rahasto [40121486, 2010-2011]","Suomen akatemia; Suomen Kulttuurirahasto, Lapin Rahasto","This work was supported by Suomen akatemia (www.aka.fi, decision 267092, to PR): complete project funding (field experiment implementation, material collection, data analysis, preparation of manuscript) and Suomen Kulttuurirahasto, Lapin Rahasto (www.skr.fi, grant 40121486, 2010-2011, to FM): running a pilot field experiment, material collection and data analysis.",NA,"60","20","20","3","60","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","JUN 2","2016","11","6","",NA,"",NA,"","","e0156620","10.1371/journal.pone.0156620","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0156620","","","18","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","DN6XB","27254100","Green Submitted, Green Published, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000377218700044","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Fluctuating fuel prices and significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels have been key impediments associated with the production and utilization of nonrenewable fossil fuels. This has resulted in escalating interests to develop new and improve inexpensive carbon neutral energy technologies to meet future demands. Various process options to produce a variety of biofuels including biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen, bio-oil, and biogas have been explored as an alternative to fossil fuels. The renewable, biodegradable, and nontoxic nature of biofuels make them appealing as alternative fuels. Biofuels can be produced from various renewable resources. Among these renewable resources, algae appear to be promising in delivering sustainable energy options. Algae have a high carbon dioxide (CO2) capturing efficiency, rapid growth rate, high biomass productivity, and the ability to grow in non-potable water. For algal biomass, the two main conversion pathways used to produce biofuel include biochemical and thermochemical conversions. Algal biofuel production is, however, challenged with process scalability for high conversion rates and high energy demands for biomass harvesting. This affects the viable achievement of industrial-scale bioprocess conversion under optimum economy. Although algal biofuels have the potential to provide a sustainable fuel for future, active research aimed at improving upstream and downstream technologies is critical. New technologies and improved systems focused on photobioreactor design, cultivation optimization, culture dewatering, and biofuel production are required to minimize the drawbacks associated with existing methods. Nanotechnology has the potential to address some of the upstream and downstream challenges associated with the development of algal biofuels. It can be applied to improve system design, cultivation, dewatering, biomass characterization, and biofuel conversion. This chapter discusses thermochemical conversion of microalgal biomass with recent advances in the application of nanotechnology to enhance the development of biofuels from algae. Nanotechnology has proven to improve the performance of existing technologies used in thermochemical treatment and conversion of biomass.

The cyclic pattern determines the balance of root:shoot and can affect the direction and speed of carbohydrate translocation during the vegetative growth period. In this study, we used water deficit to limit corresponding growth in sweet orange (Citrus x sinensis) OLL 4 grafted on US-942 rootstock, and then observed the changes of translocation dynamics between two flush statuses. Our first hypothesis was that water deficit would reduce root growth and extend the root growth phase during the growth cycle, delaying the following flush. We then tested the related second hypothesis that shoot flushes would switch the direction and slow the speed of carbohydrate transport due to fluctuation between single and dual sinks. After recovery from a severe deficit, the flush was synchronized and emerged within 2 weeks. Mild and moderate water-deficit plants showed a delayed new flush. Next, we used a C-14-labeling method to test whether translocation was affected by the presence of new flush. Basipetal translocation was dominant, but the new flush increased the likelihood of acropetal translocation. Translocation speeds were not different in both directions regardless of flushing status, though speed estimates were highly variable, even though C-14 export from the source leaf increased when new flush was present. The results suggest that flush timing across an environmental gradient is governed by source-sink dynamics. The presence of new flush altered the direction of photoassimilate translocation and rate of leaf export, but stem transport speeds were not distinguishably different.","[Li, Sheng-yang; Vincent, Christopher] Univ Florida, Hort Sci Dept, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, 700 Expt Stn Rd, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Vincent, C (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Hort Sci Dept, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, 700 Expt Stn Rd, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.","civince@ufl.edu","","Vincent, Christopher/0000-0003-0314-1231; Li, Shengyang/0000-0003-4600-1650","United States Department of Agriculture Multi-Agency Coordination System [AP19PPQS, T00C165]","United States Department of Agriculture Multi-Agency Coordination System","United States Department of Agriculture Multi-Agency Coordination System, Grant/Award Number: AP19PPQS&T00C165",NA,"57","1","1","4","11","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0031-9317","1399-3054","","PHYSIOL PLANTARUM","Physiol.

At the population level, the filamentous bacterium Candidatus Microthrix parvicella (Ca. M. parvicella) has been found to fine-tune its gene expression for optimized substrate assimilation. Here we investigated in situ substrate assimilation by single cells of Ca. M. parvicella using nano-scale secondary-ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS). NanoSIMS imaging highlighted phenotypic heterogeneity among Ca. M. parvicella cells of the same filament, whereby C-13-oleic acid and C-13-glycerol-3-phosphate assimilation occurred in approximate to 21-55% of cells, despite non-assimilating cells being intact and alive. In response to alternating aerobic-anoxic regimes, C-13-oleic acid assimilation occurred among subpopulations of Ca. M. parvicella cells (approximate to 3-28% of cells). Furthermore, Ca. M. parvicella cells exhibited two temperature optima for C-13-oleic acid assimilation and associated growth rates. These results suggest that phenotypic heterogeneity among Ca.

Publications on the analysis of the influence of thermal factor on vital functions of invertebrates with the subsequent statement of the general pattern of optimal environmental factors are reviewed. It is concluded that the optimum includes not simply the range of the factor's values on the tolerance curve or the dose of the factor providing for the most favourable life conditions, but the oscillations of the factor within the optimum range, i.e., the astatic optimum, as termed by Prof. A.S. Konstantinov. It is shown, by the example of the influence on organisms and populations of zooplankton of stepwise changes of temperature, increased doses of mineral phosphorus, and low-power laser radiation, that to determine the optimum of an environmental factor it is important to use not only its absolute values and the parameters of cyclic changes, but also the presence or absence of stepwise changes, also determining the direction of the dynamics and the duration of influence of the dose, as well as the presence and character of the after-effects (inertial action) of the factor on organisms. It is suggested to introduce more detailed and concrete definitions to distinguish between the static and then dynamic optimum. The former includes the range of optimum values of the factor on the tolerance scale and the dose of every factor matching the organism's requirements and providing for the maximum favourable life conditions. The latter includes optimum parameters of cyclic changes (frequency and amplitude) of the factor, along with determining their position in the range of optimum values (at its lower, middle, or upper part), the presence or absence of stimulating effects of stepwise changes of the factor, including the duration of influence of some dose of the factor and the order of alteration of the higher and the lower values (dynamics direction), as well as the presence or absence and the character of after-effects (inertial action) of the factor on the organism.","Russian Acad Sci, Papanin Inst Biol Inland Waters, Borok 152742, Yaroslavskaya O, Russia","Papanin Institute for Biology of Inland Waters; Russian Academy of Sciences","Verbitsky, VB (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Papanin Inst Biol Inland Waters, Nekouzskiy R-N, Borok 152742, Yaroslavskaya O, Russia.","werb@ibiw.yaroslav1.ru",", Verbitskii/AAD-5232-2020; Verbitsky, Vladimir/Q-5475-2016",", Verbitskii/0000-0002-0255-3800; Verbitsky, Vladimir/0000-0002-0255-3800","","","",NA,"108","2","8","0","11","MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA","MOSCOW","39 DIMITROVA UL., MOSCOW, 113095, RUSSIA","0044-4596","","","ZH OBSHCH BIOL","Zhurnal Obshchei Biol.","JAN-FEB","2008","69","1","",NA,"",NA,"44","56","","","","","","13","Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics","265AS","18409400","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000253332100005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The adult emergence period lasted from late February until late September, with two emergence peaks of males (March and August) and one for females (September). Females were always larger than males, illustrating a strong sexual size dimorphism. Decreasing body mass of emergent adults coincided with increasing temperature during the seasons until the end of the emergence period. Both sexes showed a significant relationship between body mass and wing length, which allowed me to estimate the loss of female body mass due to oviposition (55.7 % +/- 4.9). Egg size remained constant throughout the study (ovoid shape, mean length 216 mu m, width 186 gm) but number of eggs decreased. The results imply that increasing temperature could be responsible for the decline in size and body mass of emergent adults (both sexes).

The reuse of materials from waste (i.e., recycling) rarely occurs in social insects because it may imply significant health risks and behavioral difficulties. However, the benefit of reusing may exceed its costs under certain circumstances. For the first time, we document that ants recycle refuse materials to repair nest-mound damage. We conducted a series of field measurements and experiments to test the hypotheses that fluctuations in this behavior in the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex lobicornis depend on 1) seasonal changes in the tendency to reject refuse (a proxy of changes in their pathogen levels), and/or 2) seasonal foraging restrictions. We 1) measured the rejection of foraging ants toward experimental refuse piles among seasons and 2) analyzed how mound condition, temperatures of fungus chamber and soil surface, and foraging activity explained this behavior using a classification tree, a powerful recursive partitioning method. Foraging ants showed similar rejection levels toward refuse piles in different seasons. Colonies repaired mound damage with refuse materials only during the hottest season and when they had low foraging rates, suggesting that ants recycle their refuse by a hierarchical set of decisions dependent on the risk of fungal damage and foraging restrictions. Repairing the mounds is essential during summer, when temperatures inside damaged mounds are lethal to their fungus cultures. However, these high temperatures also restrict the foraging activity, reducing the collection of building materials. Thus, colonies with lower foraging rates apparently use their refuse to repair mounds because this substrate requires less searching and carrying time. The use of refuse did not affect the colony growth rate. This illustrates how ants integrate information about food, hygienic and nest conditions through a novel and plastic behavior: recycling of their discarded materials.","[Farji-Brener, Alejandro G.; Tadey, Mariana] Univ Comahue, Lab Ecotono, CRUB, INIBIOMA,CONICET, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Universidad Nacional del Comahue","Farji-Brener, AG (corresponding author), Univ Comahue, Lab Ecotono, CRUB, INIBIOMA,CONICET, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina.","alefarji@yahoo.com","Farji-Brener, Alejandro Gustavo/I-8372-2019","Farji-Brener, Alejandro Gustavo/0000-0001-7251-3866","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (CONICET) [PIP 1320]","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (CONICET)(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET))","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnologicas (CONICET, PIP 1320) to A.G.F.B.",NA,"46","10","10","1","53","OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC","CARY","JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA","1045-2249","1465-7279","","BEHAV ECOL","Behav.

An experiment was conducted to find the optimum irrigation regime for patch budding (in July) and tongue grafting (in March) of Persian walnut on Juglans regia rootstock under three environmental conditions (greenhouse, shade-house and outdoor). The grafted/budded plants were subjected to three irrigation regimes including 1-day, 3-day and 7-day for 4 weeks after grafting/budding. Callus formation and quality, and graft/bud-take were recorded after four weeks. The survival rate and growth of the scions were measured after three months. Based on the results, grafting success under greenhouse, shade-house and outdoor conditions were 66.7%, 42.6% and 17.6%, respectively. The highest graft/bud take (94.4%) was obtained under greenhouse conditions with patch budding. The lowest grafting success (0%) was observed under outdoor conditions with patch budding. Under the greenhouse conditions, irrigation of the grafted plants with 7-day interval resulted in the highest graft success and plant growth. Irrigation with 3-day intervals was the best regime under shade-house conditions, while daily irrigation regime was required to obtain the highest grafting success for the outdoor grown plants. In general, the present experiment revealed that modifying outdoor conditions by applying a shade-house equipped by a mist system in warmer area can improve bud-take and success especially in patch budding by 40.76 and 33.1 %, respectively.","[Sadeghi-Majd, Rasoul; Vahdati, Kourosh; Roozban, Mahmoud Reza; Arab, Mostafa] Univ Tehran, Dept Hort, Coll Aburaihan, Tehran, Iran; [Sutyemez, Mehmet] Univ Sutcu Imam, Dept Hort, Fac Agr, Kahramanmaras, Turkey","University of Tehran; Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University","Vahdati, K; Roozban, MR (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Dept Hort, Coll Aburaihan, Tehran, Iran.","kvahdati@ut.ac.ir; mroozban@ut.ac.ir","Sadeeghi-Majd, Rasoul/HJP-9340-2023","Sadeghi-Majd, Rasoul/0000-0002-2035-053X; Vahdati, Kourosh/0000-0001-8458-8697","University of Tehran, Center of Excellence in Walnut Improvement; Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)","University of Tehran, Center of Excellence in Walnut Improvement; Iran National Science Foundation (INSF)(Iran National Science Foundation (INSF))","The authors acknowledge University of Tehran, Center of Excellence in Walnut Improvement and Iran National Science Foundation (INSF) for the financial supports.

It is well established that ex situ seed banking of native wild plants prolongs seed viability and thereby preserves genetic and species diversity for future use. We evaluated ex situ storage potential of eight halophytic species from deserts in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by studying seed germination. Specifically, we examined the germinability of freshly collected seeds and seeds stored for three years in a seed bank. We also examined the effect of light conditions on fresh and stored seed germination. Fresh seeds of seven of the eight species tested had a higher germination rates under 12/12 h light/dark fluctuations than did those exposed to total darkness. Storage reduced light sensitivity in Halocnemum strobilaceum, Suaeda aegyptiaca, Salsola drummondii and Salsola imbricata, but increased the requirement for light in Arthrocnemum macrostachyum. In Anabasis setifera, storage decreased germination percentage when there was a 12-hour light/dark fluctuation, but increased germination rate when exposed to the dark treatment. Storage significantly reduced germination in both the light/dark and dark treatments in Suaeda vermiculata and S. aegyptiaca. Germination speed also responded differently to storage; whereas Timson's index significantly increased in A. macrostachyum and H. strobilaceum, it significantly decreased for S. drummondii, S. aegyptiaca and S. vermiculata. Germination of these species at a range of temperatures requires further testing; additionally, we strongly suggest that these laboratory findings be complemented by field studies.

However, the use of historical solar radiation is inconvenient for thermo-economic optimization because it involves considerable computational effort for simulation. To overcome this inconvenience, we propose the thereto-economic optimization of SORC by using typical solar radiation year (TSRY). TSRY is a synthesis of typical solar radiation on the basis of historical solar radiation, indicating that TSRY can reflect the typical features of fluctuations in solar radiation in a specific area. Afterward, the multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) is selected to optimize the dynamic performance of a small-scale SORC by using the TSRY. In GA, the evaporation temperature and capacity of thermal energy storage are taken as optimization parameters, and the power output and fluctuation in power output are optimization goals. Accordingly, Pareto frontiers that optimize the SORC performance can be obtained. The effect of different parameter combinations in the Pareto frontiers and the scale of the SORC on thermo-economic are further analyzed using annual net profit as an indicator. Our analysis shows that a minimum SORC scale for profitability is set for a given location, and the profit growth rate increases as the system scale increases.","[Li, Shuai; Li, Weiyi] Tianjin Univ, Key Lab Efficient Utilizat Low & Medium Grade Ene, MOE, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China","Tianjin University","Li, WY (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Key Lab Efficient Utilizat Low & Medium Grade Ene, MOE, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.","liwy@tju.edu.cn","","","","","",NA,"27","6","6","0","21","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0196-8904","1879-2227","","ENERG CONVERS MANAGE","Energy Conv.

Regional indicators on the distribution and peculiarities of biology and ecology of the South American tomato moth are estimated, both in importing tomatoes to Ukraine and in the use of modern technologies, mainly the range of insecticides, taking into account the organogenesis of cultivated plants. It specified the areas of new territories of moth reproduction by seasonal monitoring of the quarantine pest species development, considering the impact of globalization processes, changes in weather and climatic factors, and new ecosystems. We have determined biology and ecology indicators that affect the pest's acclimatization and occupation of new ecological niches in the structure of local species that affect tomatoes' yield and quality. Simultaneously, we have determined predictors for predicting the South American tomato moth's development and reproduction under the modern effectiveness of phytophage control measures at the species and population levels. The resistance of individual tomato varieties to Tuta absoluta was studied. The guidelines for determining the degree of phytophage colonization of tomatoes at the main stages of yield formation in vegetable crop rotations under relatively long reproduction and survival and a high pest population in the research region were developed. We have noted the importance of assessing the impact of rising air temperature on the duration of the autumn period of tomato growth and development and changes in moths' ecological optimum and pest spread in individual farms of the steppe zone. According to the population density indicators of this species, it was specified the mechanisms of tomato entomological community formation, taking into account the first years of localization of the South American moth foci. We have specified quarantine measures of phytophage control, both by the South American tomato moth phenology levels and the impact of agricultural background and weather fluctuations on moths number of generations, number, and survival rate these pests in the Ukrainian Steppe.","[Bilousova, T.

The objective of this study was to review and synthesize literature on chamber designs (non-flow-through, non-steady-state chamber) and associated factors that affect GHG nitrous oxide (N2O) flux measurement when using chamber methods. Chamber design requires consideration of many facets that include materials, insulation, sealing, venting, depth of placement, and the need to maintain plant growth and activity. Final designs should be tailored, and bench tested, in order to meet the nuances of the experimental objectives and the ecosystem under study while reducing potential artifacts. Good insulation, to prevent temperature fluctuations and pressure changes, and a high-quality seal between base and chamber are essential. Elimination of pressure differentials between headspace and atmosphere through venting should be performed, and designs now exist to eliminate Venturi effects of earlier tube-type vent designs. The use of fans within the chamber headspace increases measurement precision but may alter the flux. To establish best practice recommendations when using fans, further data are required, particularly in systems containing tall plants, to systematically evaluate the effects that fan speed, position, and mixing rate have on soil gas flux.","[Clough, Timothy J.] Fac Agr & Life Sci, Dept Soil & Phys Sci, POB 84, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand; [Rochette, Philippe] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Soils & Crops Res & Dev, 2560 Hochelaga Blvd, Quebec City, PQ G1V 2J3, Canada; [Thomas, Steve M.] Canterbury Agr & Sci Ctr, Plant & Food Res, Soil Water & Environm Grp, Gerald St, Lincoln 7608, New Zealand; [Pihlatie, Mari] Univ Helsinki, Environm Soil Sci, Dept Agr Sci, POB 56, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Pihlatie, Mari] Univ Helsinki, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Forest Sci, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Pihlatie, Mari] Univ Helsinki, Viikki Plant Sci Ctr ViPS, POB 56, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Christiansen, Jesper R.] Univ Copenhagen, Div Ecosyst & Biomass Sci Forest & Landscape, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Thorman, Rachel E.] ADAS Boxworth, Battlegate Rd, Cambridge CB23 4NN, England","Agriculture & Agri Food Canada; New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research Ltd; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki; University of Copenhagen","Clough, TJ (corresponding author), Fac Agr & Life Sci, Dept Soil & Phys Sci, POB 84, Lincoln 7647, New Zealand.","Timothy.Clough@lincoln.ac.nz","Christiansen, Jesper/L-7961-2014; Clough, Tim/Q-4982-2018; Pihlatie, Mari/B-4651-2008","Christiansen, Jesper/0000-0002-3277-0734; Clough, Tim/0000-0002-5978-5274; Pihlatie, Mari/0000-0001-6035-3949","New Zealand Government","New Zealand Government","This work was funded by the New Zealand Government to support the objectives of the Livestock Research Group of the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases.",NA,"38","21","21","2","12","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0047-2425","1537-2537","","J ENVIRON QUAL","J.

Methods: By using a combination of continuous 60-year meteorological and 6-year tower-based carbon dioxide (CO2) flux measurements, we constructed a clear picture of a HWs effect on the dynamics of carbon, water, and vegetation on the Eurasian Songnen meadow steppe. Results: The number of HWs in the Songnen meadow steppe began increasing since the 1980s and the rate of occurrence has advanced since the 2010s to higher than ever before. HWs can reduce the grassland carbon flux, while net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) will regularly fluctuate for 4-5 days during the HW before decreasing. However, ecosystem respiration (Re) and gross ecosystem production (GEP) decline from the beginning of the HW until the end, where Re and GEP will decrease 30% and 50%, respectively. When HWs last five days, water-use efficiency (WUE) will decrease by 26%, soil water content (SWC) by 30% and soil water potential (SWP) will increase by 38%. In addition, the soil temperature will still remain high after the HW although the air temperature will recover to its previous state. Conclusions: HWs, as an extreme weather event, have increased during the last two decades in the Songnen meadow steppe. HWs will reduce the carbon flux of the steppe and will cause a sustained impact. Drought may be the main reason why HWs decrease carbon flux. At the later stages of or after a HW, the ecosystem usually lacks water and the soil becomes so hot and dry that it prevents roots from absorbing enough water to maintain their metabolism. This is the main reason why this grassland carbon exchange decreases during and after HWs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

At least 100 of them have been subjected to scientific studies. Habitat variables responsible for a reservoir's productivity can be summed up into climatic, morphometric and hydro-edaphic factors. The peninsular reservoirs are characterized by a narrow range of fluctuations in water and air temperature across seasons, a phenomenon which prevents the formation of thermal stratification. Many reservoirs in the upper peninsula show thermal stratification during summer. Wind-induced turbulence facilitates the return of nutrients to the trophogenic zone. Most reservoirs on the mountain slopes of Western Ghats, Himalayas and the other highlands are deeper, with steeper basin walls, compared to irrigation impoundments. Mean depth does not show any direct correlation with productivity, either at primary or fish level. A high shoreline development index gives a better indication of productivity. Plankton, benthos and periphyton pulses of Indian reservoirs coincide with the months of least level fluctuations. Oligotrophic tendencies shown by some reservoirs are mainly due to poor nutrient status and other chemical deficiencies. In most cases, poor water quality is accountable to poor catchment soil. Low levels of phosphate and nitrate are not indicative of low productivity due to quick recycling of these nutrients. Specific conductivity reflects the production propensities of reservoirs satisfactorily. Almost all productive reservoirs have a klinograde oxygen curve and a vertical stratification of chemical variables such as pH, carbon dioxide, total alkalinity and specific conductivity. High seasonal rainfall and discharge of water during monsoon result in high flushing rates, which do not favour colonization by macrophytic communities. Similarly, inadequate availability of suitable substrata retards the growth of periphyton. Plankton constitutes the major link in the trophic structure. A rich plankton community with well-marked succession is the hallmark of Indian reservoirs with blue-green algae as the major component. The main factors that retard the growth of benthos are a rocky bottom, frequent water level fluctuation and rapid deposition of silt and other suspended particles. Large reservoirs, on average, harbour 60 species of fishes, of which at least 40 contribute to the commercial fisheries. Fast-growing Indian major carps are the prominent commercial fishes. Dam construction has adversely affected populations of many other species such as Tenualosa ilisha, Tor spp. and Cirrhinus spp. Formulae for estimating fish yield potential and stocking density are described. While culture-based fisheries have been successfully practiced in many small reservoirs, the management norm followed in medium and large reservoirs is primarily on capture fishery. In large and medium reservoirs, stocking was successful only when stocked fishes bred. Indian experience on species enhancement and introductions is described. Environmental enhancement of small reservoirs has been attempted in some reservoirs of Tamil Nadu. Modeling, using standard population parameters, such as the density-dependent growth, size dependent mortality and weight-length relationship is discussed. Two exotic fishes viz., Oreochromis mossambicus and Cyprinus carpio have been introduced into Indian reservoir with discouraging results. Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, after an accidental introduction, has performed well in Gobindsagar, a reservoir with a distinct cold water regime. Reservoir fisheries in India are well poised for development, provided scientific management norms are adopted.","Cent Inland Capture Fisheries Res Inst, Barakpur 743101, W Bengal, India","Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR); ICAR - Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute","Sugunan, VV (corresponding author), Cent Inland Capture Fisheries Res Inst, Barakpur 743101, W Bengal, India.","","","","","","",NA,"160","32","37","1","31","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0018-8158","","","HYDROBIOLOGIA","Hydrobiologia","JUL","2000","430","1-3","",NA,"",NA,"121","147","","10.1023/A:1004081316185","http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004081316185","","","27","Marine & Freshwater Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Marine & Freshwater Biology","341KE",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000088588900008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

First-rotation growth rates are high, partly because of previous use of fertilisers and annual leguminous pasture species by farmers. A series of inter-rotation experiments has been established at two sites with contrasting soils to investigate options for plantation management that will maintain soil fertility and stand productivity in subsequent rotations. These experiments include alternatives for managing harvest residues, use of inter-row legumes and nutrient application rate trials. After harvest, about one-quarter of the N and half of the P and Ca in the trees was exported from the sites in logs. Most of the exported N and P was in the wood, whereas most Ca was in the bark. Where burning was used to remove harvest residues and prepare the site for planting, more than 500 kg ha(-1) of N was lost from the more fertile site. Retention of harvest residues tended to increase soil moisture, moderate diurnal temperature fluctuations and enhance the pool of potentially available N. Soil organic matter content declined in the first two years following harvest, largely due to a reduction in the labile pool of soil carbon. There are indications of a reversal in this trend in the third year after harvesting, probably due to inputs of plant residue from turnover of roots. Early growth rates of trees were enhanced by retention of harvest residues, but longer-term measurements are needed to confirm this trend.","CSIRO, Forestry & Forest Prod, Wembly, WA 6014, Australia","Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)","O'Connell, AM (corresponding author), CSIRO, Forestry & Forest Prod, Private Bag,PO Wembly, Wembly, WA 6014, Australia.","","","","","","",NA,"10","10","12","0","6","CENTER INT FORESTRY RESEARCH CIFOR","BOGOR","PO BOX 6596, BOGOR 16680, INDONESIA","","","979-8764-33-1","","","","1999",NA,"","",NA,"",NA,"53","59","","","","","","7","Forestry","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Forestry","BW31Y",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000181552600008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Results showed that the growth and survival of germlings were significantly affected by salinity and duration of osmotic stress, rather than by osmotic frequency. In addition to the main effects, all two-way, three-way and four-way interactions between the four stresses on the growth were significant. Germlings showed quick growth with relative growth rate (RGR, % day(-1)) over 16% when cultured at 32 psu combined with 30 degrees C. Although growths of germlings subjected to hypo-osmotic and hyper-osmotic conditions were significantly inhibited, RGRs over 12% were obtained except for those at 35 degrees C with the RGRs below 10%. In comparison to growth, survival was more tolerant to osmotic stress. Germlings showed high survivals over 60% when exposed to most osmotic stresses, by the end of experiment Only under extreme conditions (12 psu for 4 h or 8 h at 35 degrees C) were the survivals reduced to below 10%. Although the effects of osmotic stress on the growth and survival were significant, germlings exhibited quick growth and high survival under most conditions. And those extreme conditions which had great destructive effect on germlings barely exist in field. Therefore, the construction of artificial tanks is feasible for the restoration of S. thunbergii beds in the intertidal zone. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Six episodes of reef growth are documented (Burdigalian to Messinian) in Neogene basins of the Betic Cordillera, which were located close to the margin of the global reef belt. The reefs are characterized by various zooxanthellate corals which decrease in diversity with time, and Halimeda; the youngest reefs of the latest Messinian are characterized by the dominance of the genus Porites. Late Miocene coral reefs and reef-rimmed platforms alternate over time with non-reefal carbonate ramps characterized by skeletal calcirudites or with gypsum such as that formed during the Messinian salinity crisis. The calcirudites lack reef corals, calcified green algae and extensive marine cement, but exhibit skeletal components described from both modern and fossil nontropical carbonates. These include bryozoans, mollusks, foraminifers, echinoderms and minor balanids, as well as coralline algae of a bryomol association. The presence of some larger foraminifers indicates high temperatures, close to the lower temperature threshold of the reef assemblage. Sea level lowstands and highstands are documented by wedges of bryomol carbonate and chlorozoan patch reefs or prograding platforms. Thus, temperate climate depositional modes correspond to relatively low sea levels, and warm-water modes to high sea levels. The Neogene infill of the Agua Amarga and Sorbas basins documents two of these cycles. Other climate/sea-level cycles (including Messinian gypsum in the cool water depositional mode) are well established in adjacent Neogene basins in southern Spain. This type of composite sequence seems to occur only along the margin of the global reef belt and indicates an oscillatory latitudinal movement of the margin, which is associated with global climatic change. The analysis of turnover in neritic depositional carbonate systems may therefore be considered a sensitive tool for reconstructing climatic change from the fossil record. However, warm-water modes and temperate-water modes of carbonate sedimentation and diagenesis differ significantly. For this reason the interpretation of composite system sequences by sequence stratigraphy requires an extended concept. The particular type of mixed bryomol-chlorozoan depositional sequence also bears some potential for drowning, because sea level rise may be faster than the net production rate of temperate carbonate systems.","INST GEOL PALAONTOL, D-60054 FRANKFURT, GERMANY; DEPT ESTRATIG & PALEONTOL, E-18002 GRANADA, SPAIN","","Brachert, TC (corresponding author), INST GEOWISSENSCH, SAARSTR 21, D-55099 MAINZ, GERMANY.","","Braga, Juan Carlos/K-3786-2017; Martín, José/S-4275-2017; Brachert, Thomas/A-9926-2010","Braga, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-2657-0584; Martín, José/0000-0003-4742-5252; Brachert, Thomas/0000-0003-3904-4804; Betzler, Christian/0000-0002-5757-4553","","","",NA,"65","58","59","0","15","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0016-7835","","","GEOL RUNDSCH","Geol.

The current study is the first comprehensive approach to the spatial distribution and the fluctuations in abundance, biomass, community structure, and diversity of the mesozooplankton from different habitats located in Scotia Bay in summers: 2014 and 2015, characterized by a different timing in seasonal sea ice retreat. Mean seawater temperature and abundances of calanoids, cyclopoids, nauplii, and appendicularians were one order of magnitude higher in summer 2014. Despite these environmental differences, biomass values of these groups proved similar for both summers. A total of ten species of copepods and one of appendicularians (Fritillaria borealis) were identified. Oithonid copepods-O. similis, followed by O. frigida-represented the bulk of mesozooplankton abundances in both summers. The highest total mesozooplankton abundance (2111 ind m(-3)) and biomass (14075 A mu g C m(-3)) were found next to an Ad,lie penguin breeding area (2014), while the highest Shannon index values were found next to a glacier in both summers. Multivariate analyses based on species abundance showed two main groups of sites, one of them encompassing all summer 2014 samplings and the other comprising all summer 2015 samplings. The positive correlation between O. similis and the 2-10 mu m Chl-a fraction suggests that summer 2014 represented optimal conditions-in terms of food-for the growth and development of this species. Experimental studies based on natural prey assemblages revealed that O. similis feeds on flagellates rather than on diatoms.","[Spinelli, Mariela L.; Capitanio, Fabiana L.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, IBBEA, Intendente Guiraldes 2160 Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Spinelli, Mariela L.; Capitanio, Fabiana L.] Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat Buenos Aires, Lab Zoplancton Marino, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Expt, Intendente Guiraldes 2160 Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Franzosi, Claudio; Alder, Viviana A.] Inst Antartico Argentino, Direcc Nacl Antartico, 25 Mayo 1143, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Olguin Salinas, Hector; Alder, Viviana A.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Ecol Genet & Evoluc, Intendente Guiraldes 2160,Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Olguin Salinas, Hector; Alder, Viviana A.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, IEGEBA, Intendente Guiraldes 2160 Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires; Instituto Antartico Argentino; University of Buenos Aires; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires","Spinelli, ML (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, IBBEA, Intendente Guiraldes 2160 Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Spinelli, ML (corresponding author), Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat Buenos Aires, Lab Zoplancton Marino, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Expt, Intendente Guiraldes 2160 Ciudad Univ,C1428EGA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.","marielaspinelli@bg.fcen.uba.ar","","","CONICET, Argentina; FONCYT [PICT-O 2010-0128]; Instituto Antartico Argentino [PICT-O 2010-0128]","CONICET, Argentina(Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)); FONCYT(FONCyT); Instituto Antartico Argentino","We thank M.

Simulated anomalies of the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) during the last two El Nino events also agree well with satellite observations. Our model results suggest that changes in net primary productivity (NPP) are mainly responsible for the observed anomalies in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate. Changes in heterotrophic respiration (R-h) mostly happen in the same direction, but with smaller amplitude. We attribute the unusual acceleration of the atmospheric CO2 growth rate during 2002-2003 to a coincidence of moderate El Nino conditions in the tropics with a strong NPP decrease at northern mid latitudes, only partially compensated by decreased R-h.","Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, QUEST, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; Commiss European Communities, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, I-21020 Ispra, Italy; Max Planck Inst Meteorol, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; FastOpt, D-20357 Hamburg, Germany","University of Bristol; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Max Planck Society","Knorr, W (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Dept Earth Sci, QUEST, Wills Mem Bldg, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England.","wolfgang.knorr@bristol.ac.uk","Scholze, Marko/N-4573-2014","Scholze, Marko/0000-0002-3474-5938","","","",NA,"29","34","34","0","12","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","WASHINGTON","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","0094-8276","1944-8007","","GEOPHYS RES LETT","Geophys.

An experiment was performed in an outdoor large-scale mesocosm three times from 2011 to 2012 by comparing the responses to adjustment as a function of the volume of JFS in the control and experimental groups. Analysis results of the environmental monitoring over three periods indicated only minor differences in the physicochemical characteristics of the water quality and phyto-and zoo-plankton biomass, thereby enabling a comparative analysis of the feeding ecology. However, the water temperature exhibited large fluctuations, ranging from 16.4 to 27.6 degrees C, and high water temperature conditions (Period 1, 25.6 +/- 2.0 degrees C) enhanced the predation activity of the piscivorous fish Coreoperca herzi (C. herzi, size 89 +/- 4 mm). Statistically, the survival rates of the prey fish, Rhynchocypris oxycephalus (R. oxycephalus, size 29 +/- 1 mm), with JFSs were greater by 35.9%-46.7%, and improved as the patch volume of JFS increased. Based on both experimental observations and statistical analysis, the JFS developed in this study could reduce the chances of predator-prey encounters, minimize prey vulnerability, and thereby increase prey survival rates.","[Lee, Saeromi; Ahn, Chang Hyuk; Song, Ho Myeon; Park, Jae Roh] Korea Inst Civil Engn & Bldg Technol, Environm & Plant Engn Res Inst, Goyang 10223, South Korea; [Joo, Jin Chul] Hanbat Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Daejeon 34158, South Korea","Korea Institute of Civil Engineering & Building Technology (KICT); Hanbat National University","Park, JR (corresponding author), Korea Inst Civil Engn & Bldg Technol, Environm & Plant Engn Res Inst, Goyang 10223, South Korea.;Joo, JC (corresponding author), Hanbat Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Daejeon 34158, South Korea.","saeromi@kict.re.kr; chahn@kict.re.kr; hmsong@kict.re.kr; jrpark@kict.re.kr; jincjoo@hanbat.ac.kr","Lee, Saeromi/AAD-7043-2022; Joo, Jin Chul/Y-9304-2019","","River Restoration Program for Developing Coexistence between Nature and Humans (Green River) (12 technological innovation C02) - Korea Institute of Construction & Transportation Technology Evaluation and Planning","River Restoration Program for Developing Coexistence between Nature and Humans (Green River) (12 technological innovation C02) - Korea Institute of Construction & Transportation Technology Evaluation and Planning","This research was supported by a grant from the River Restoration Program for Developing Coexistence between Nature and Humans (Green River) (12 technological innovation C02) funded by the Korea Institute of Construction & Transportation Technology Evaluation and Planning.",NA,"58","1","1","0","4","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","2073-4441","","","WATER-SUI","Water","JAN","2017","9","1","",NA,"",NA,"","","36","10.3390/w9010036","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9010036","","","14","Environmental Sciences; Water Resources","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources","EJ0ZN",NA,"Green Submitted, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000392939900036","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The dynamics of oxygen, carbon and carbonate fluxes at the water-sediment interface were assessed using benthic chambers. Community respiration (CR) fluctuated in accordance with the seasonal changes in water temperature, from 1.5 mmol C m(-2) h(-1) in winter to 8.7 mmol C m-2 h-1 in summer. Mean gross community production (GCP) varied significantly among seasons, according to incident irradiance and temperature, from 3.4 mmol C m(-2) h(-1) in winter to 12.7 mmol C m(-2) h(-1) in summer. Mean annual P-max for the P-E curve was estimated to 13.3 mmol C m(-2) h(-1). Carbonate precipitation only occurred during light incubations and varied seasonally from 0.7 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) h(-1) in winter to 4.2 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) h(-1) in summer. Mean annual Pmax was 3.2 mmol CaCO3 m(-2) h(-1). Annual CR was estimated to 407.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1), and GCP, to 240.9 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Maerl communities are, therefore, heterotrophic systems (GCP:CR = 0.6), and are a source Of CO2 for surrounding environments. In addition, CO2 released by calcification averaged 39.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1).

Populations of the terrestrial isopod Armadillidum vulgare (Latreille) fluctuated in density by over an order magnitude on each of three grassland sites differing markedly in habitat structure. Density and survivorship were negatively correlated with rainfall but not significantly with mean litter layer temperatures. An interaction between temperature and rainfall accentuated the negative effects on excess moisture. Tussocks in lightly grazed swards provide an important source of shelter from excessively wet conditions and from extremes of diurnal temperature fluctuation. Reduction of spatial heterogeneity in habitat structure caused by heavier grazing pressure resulted in increased mortality and decreases in population density. Shorter, more heavily grazed, swards have a higher biomass of dicotyledonous plants, the leaf litter of which forms a high quality food resource for which competition in lent: swards leads to reduced growth rates, fecundity, and natality rates in A. vulgare. When availability of this food source was experimentally increased on the site which already had the highest levels of dicotyledonous litter production, marked increases in growth and development rates and fecundity occurred, despite decreases in litter layer temperatures. We conclude that population regulation by intra-specific competition for limited food resources occurs throughout the density ranges observed but that the levels of this resource, which determine the carrying capacity of these habitats for this species, are subject to frequent changes due to variation in rabbit grazing intensity which results in dynamic equilibrium levels for the populations. Stochastic changes in the availability of shelter can reduce densities to levels at which competition for food is reduced. Under these conditions, near to the 'density floor' of the populations, extinction is avoided and recovery accelerated by the increases in growth and natality rates that result from reduced competition for food. This density dependent process therefore does act as a biotic compensating mechanism increasing the probability that the populations will persist throughout stochastic environmental perturbations.","","","Hassall, M (corresponding author), UNIV E ANGLIA,SCH ENVIRONM SCI,NORWICH NR4 7TJ,NORFOLK,ENGLAND.","","","","","","",NA,"48","19","19","1","29","GUSTAV FISCHER VERLAG","JENA","VILLENGANG 2, D-07745 JENA, GERMANY","0031-4056","","","PEDOBIOLOGIA","Pedobiologia","JUL","1997","41","4","",NA,"",NA,"342","360","","","","","","19","Ecology; Soil Science","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture","XM973",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1997XM97300011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The vapor condensation occurs in transonic flow when the temperature drops below dew point during the accelerating expansion and affects the performance of equipment and safety. The unsteady condensation model based on nucleation and droplet growth model, and the Shear Stress Transport (SST) viscous turbulence model for moist air condensing in transonic flows was proposed. The prediction accuracy of steady and unsteady condensing flows was validated by experimental data and theory. The unsteady frequency and fluctuation intensity of pressures for symmetric and asymmetric condensing oscillation modes were discussed. A new formula (f(0) = 1.992 Phi(1.539)(0)w(s)(0.3853)) of dimensional frequency related with inlet relative humidity and saturated vapor mass fraction was obtained. Then, periodic mass flux, pressure loss and droplet mass generation rate distributions at different carrier gas pressure were analyzed. The pressure loss coefficient represents the energy loss. As the carrier gas pressure increases, the mass flow rate increases, but the energy of condensation-induced shock decreases. Combined with the analysis of the distribution of liquid mass fraction, it is also found that Mach number and pressure fluctuation are induced by condensation wave due to heat release. Finally, the velocity phase diagrams and heat addition of per unit volume at different oscillation modes were assessed. It reveals the maximum heat addition amounts of per unit volume for three symmetric modes are 1.28 x 10(3), 1.48 x 10(3) and 1.54 x 10(3) MW m(-3) along the increase of humidity.","[Ding, Hongbing; Zhao, Yafei; Tian, Yuhe; Wang, Chao] Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Proc Measurement & Control, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Wen, Chuang] Univ Nottingham, Fac Engn, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England","Tianjin University; University of Nottingham","Wang, C (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Proc Measurement & Control, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.","wangchao@tju.edu.cn","Ding, Hongbing/AAC-6298-2019; Wang, Chao/HHZ-2801-2022; Wen, Chuang/I-5663-2016","Ding, Hongbing/0000-0002-0316-134X; Wang, Chao/0000-0002-4362-947X; Wen, Chuang/0000-0002-4445-1589","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51876143, 61873184, 61627803]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SklodowskaCurie grant [792876]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SklodowskaCurie grant(SKA South Africa)","This work is supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 51876143, 61873184, and 61627803, in part by European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie SklodowskaCurie grant agreement No 792876.",NA,"44","0","0","6","21","ELSEVIER FRANCE-EDITIONS SCIENTIFIQUES MEDICALES ELSEVIER","ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX","65 RUE CAMILLE DESMOULINS, CS50083, 92442 ISSY-LES-MOULINEAUX, FRANCE","1290-0729","1778-4166","","INT J THERM SCI","Int.

A wanner climate will extend the thermal growing season and the physiologically effective part of it. Winters will also become milder, enabling introduction of winter-sown crops to a greater extent than is possible today. With this study we aim to characterise the likely regional differences in capacity to grow different seed producing crops. Prolongation of the Finnish growing season was estimated using a 0.5 degrees latitude x 0.5 degrees longitude gridded dataset from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The dataset comprised an average estimate from 19 global climate models of the response of Finnish climate to low (B 1) and high (A2) scenarios of greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions for 30-year periods centred on 2025, 2055 and 2085 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Growing season temperature sums that suit crop growth and are agronomically feasible in Finland are anticipated to increase by some 140 degrees Cd by 2025, 300 degrees Cd by 2055 and 470 degrees Cd by 2085 in scenario A2, when averaged over regions, and earlier sowing is expected to take place, but not later harvests. Accordingly, the extent of cultivable areas for the commonly grown major and minor crops will increase considerably. Due to the higher base temperature requirement for maize (Zea mays L.) growth than for temperate crops, we estimate that silage maize could become a Finnish field crop for the most favourable growing regions only at the end of this century. Winters are getting milder, but it will take almost the whole century until winters such as those that are typical for southern Sweden and Denmark are experienced on a wide scale in Finland. It is possible that introduction of winter-sown crops (cereals and rapeseed) will represent major risks due to fluctuating winter conditions, and this could delay their adaptation for many decades. Such risks need to be studied in more detail to estimate timing of introduction. Prolonged physiologically effective growing seasons would increase yielding capacities of major field crops. Of the current minor crops, oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack), pea (Pisum sativum L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) are particularly strong candidates to become major crops. Moreover, they have good potential for industrial processing and are currently being bred. Realisation of increased yield potential requires adaptation to 1) elevated daily mean temperatures that interfere with development rate of seed crops under long days, 2) relative reductions in water availability at critical phases of yield determination, 3) greater pest and disease pressure, 4) other uncertainties caused by weather extremes and 5) generally greater need for inputs such as nitrogen fertilisers for non-nitrogen fixing crops.","[Peltonen-Sainio, Pirjo; Hakala, Kaija] MTT Agrifood Res Finland, Plant Prod Res, FI-31600 Jokioinen, Finland; [Jauhiainen, Lauri; Ojanen, Hannu] MTT Agrifood Res Finland, Serv Unit, FI-31600 Jokioinen, Finland","Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)","Peltonen-Sainio, P (corresponding author), MTT Agrifood Res Finland, Plant Prod Res, FI-31600 Jokioinen, Finland.","pirjo.peltonen-sainio@mtt.fi; lauri.jauhiainen@mtt.fi; kaija.hakala@mtt.fi; hannu.ojanen@mtt.fi","Hakala, Kaija/E-3745-2017","Hakala, Kaija/0000-0002-0172-1892; Jauhiainen, Lauri/0000-0003-2073-1057","Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; MTT Agrifood Research Finland; Raisio Ltd","Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; MTT Agrifood Research Finland; Raisio Ltd","The authors are grateful to the numerous partners who participated in organising the MTT Official Cultivar Trials since 1970 and to the Finnish Meteorological Institute for climate change datasets provided for use in the ILMASOPU-project.

As S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) is the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine biosynthesis, efforts were made to isolate the gene encoding SAMDC from 'Newhall' navel orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck). RT-PCR, in combination with a bioinformatics approach, produced a cDNA (CsSAMDC) containing an intact open reading frame (ORF) of 1,095 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence shared high homology (>75%) with four selected plant SAMDCs and possessed several highly-conserved amino acid residues or motifs. Expression of CsSAMDC in Escherichia coli gave rise to a protein of the expected size, which was shown to have biochemical activity via a SAMDC assay. The expression pattern of the CsSAMDC gene in 'Newhall' callus tissue broadly matched the growth of callus cells and the fluctuation in endogenous polyamine levels. Levels of transcription of CsSAMDC in 'Newhall' shoots were enhanced by treatment with 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol. In addition, the steady state level of CsSAMDC mRNA varied in genotypes with varying levels of tolerance to salinity or to low temperature stress, as revealed by the earlier induction of CsSAMDC mRNA at the initial stages of either stress treatment in tolerant genotypes. These results suggest that CsSAMDC is a stress-responsive gene and that temporal changes in its expression profile may be part of the mechanism responsible for genotypic variations in stress tolerance.","[Wang, Jing; Liu, Ji-Hong] Huazhong Agr Univ, Natl Key Lab Crop Genet Improvement, Natl Ctr Crop Mol Breeding, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Kurosawa, Toshihito; Nada, Kazuyoshi] Mie Univ, Fac Bioresources, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan; [Ban, Yusuke; Moriguchi, Takaya] Natl Inst Fruit Tree Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058605, Japan","Huazhong Agricultural University; Mie University; National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan","Liu, JH (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Natl Key Lab Crop Genet Improvement, Natl Ctr Crop Mol Breeding, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.","liujihong@mail.hzau.edu.cn","Ban, Yusuke/AAV-1326-2020","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [30671435, 30623012, 30871685, 30921002]; Ministry of Education of China [NCET-06-0666, 118095]; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation [114034]; Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (RFDP)); Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation(Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation); Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation","This work was supported financially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project Nos. 30671435, 30623012, 30871685, and 30921002), the Ministry of Education of China (Project Nos.

The area under cultivation of this tree is increasing annually. Date palms usually grown under harsh and unfavorable growing conditions with low rainfall and high rates of evaporation as well as in soils with low organic matter and nutrient deficiencies. Hence, date palm cultivation becomes dependent on application of high levels of fertilizers as well as on irrigation. This may lead to salinization of soil and leaching of nutrients to deep soils that might affect ground water. Therefore, it is important that date palm plantations are managed in a sustainable way to reduce the impact of date palm cultivation on ecosystems while maximizing dates yield through using such practices as mycorrhizal fungi technology. The application of mycorrhizal fungi technology is an option that can benefit both agronomic plant health and ecosystems. Mycorrhizae confer numerous benefits to host plants including improved plant growth and mineral nutrition, water uptake, tolerance to diseases and stresses such as drought, temperature fluctuation, metal toxicity and salinity. Mycorrhizae may also play a role in the formation of stable soil aggregates, building up a macro porous structure of soil that allows penetration of water and air and prevents erosion. All of these beneficial effects on plant health and soil fitness mean that mycorrhizae have the potential to increase agricultural productivity and are crucial for the sustainable functioning of agricultural ecosystems. This study provides an insight into the application of mycorrhizae in date palm cultivation.","[Al-Karaki, Ghazi N.] Minist Environm & Water, Dept Agr Dev, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Al-Karaki, Ghazi N.] Jordan Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Agr, Irbid, Jordan","Jordan University of Science & Technology","Al-Karaki, GN (corresponding author), Minist Environm & Water, Dept Agr Dev, POB 1509, Dubai, U Arab Emirates.","alkarakig@yahoo.com","","Al-Karaki, Ghazi/0000-0002-0946-769X","","","",NA,"47","11","11","7","49","UNITED ARAB EMIRATES UNIV","AL AIN","P.

We found reproducible diel oxygen patterns and daily metabolic rates. The charophyte canopy accounted for almost all primary production and respiration of the ecosystem. Two novel discoveries-profound afternoon depression of production and nighttime decline of respiration-occurred on virtually every day. Extensive increase of oxygen-, temperature- and pH- levels and depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and - CO2 concentrations could account for maximum NEP-rates before noon and afternoon depression with low NEP-rates. Ecosystem respiration declined during the night to 24-70% of rates at sunset, probably because of depletion of respiratory substrates. Afternoon depression of photosynthesis should be widespread in numerous habitats with dense growth of macrophytes, periphyton, or phytoplankton implying that daily photosynthesis and growth are restricted and species with efficient DIC use may have an advantage.","[Kragh, Theis; Andersen, Mikkel Rene; Sand-Jensen, Kaj] Univ Copenhagen, Biol Inst, Freshwater Biol Sect, Univ Pk 4, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark","University of Copenhagen","Kragh, T (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Biol Inst, Freshwater Biol Sect, Univ Pk 4, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.","tkragh@bio.ku.dk","","Kragh, Theis/0000-0002-9760-2571; Andersen, Mikkel/0000-0003-2104-2894","Villum Kann Ramussen Centre of Excellence for Lake Restoration; Carlsberg Foundation","Villum Kann Ramussen Centre of Excellence for Lake Restoration; Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation)","This study was supported by grants from The Villum Kann Ramussen Centre of Excellence for Lake Restoration to Mikkel Rene Andersen and Kaj Sand-Jensen as well as from the Carlsberg Foundation to Kaj Sand-Jensen.

Different naturally occurring conditions of heat and drought were simulated in order to observe the ecophysiological responses to them in 2a I. barbatus seedlings, such as leaf gas exchange, fine root and leaf water potential, and antioxidase activity. The results showed that the following. 1) 2a I. barbatus seedlings responded differently to different heat and drought conditions; elevated temperatures significantly increased the transpiration rate and stomatal conductance, but non-stomatal limitations caused a decrease in the photosynthetic rate and restricted diurnal fluctuations in photosynthesis under extreme heat conditions. 2) Under moderate drought and its compounded conditions with heat, stomatal limitations caused a decreased photosynthetic rate. 3) Under severe drought and its compounded conditions with heat, the physiological processes of seedlings were severely impacted, and this was further compounded by the effects of high temperature, resulting in significantly decreased rates of transpiration, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and water use efficiency. 4) In the control, high temperature, and extreme temperature groups, water potential decreased more dramatically in fine roots than in mature leaves. 5) The effects of heat and drought on three types of antioxidases in the fine roots and mature leaves were consistent; superoxide dismutase activity in fine roots was higher than in mature leaves, while the reverse was observed for catalase and peroxidase activity. Therefore, fine roots are a critical structure in the adaptation of I. barbatus seedlings to heat and drought, as water absorption organs are more sensitive than transpiration organs. This study showed that I. barbatus seedlings are relatively resistant to heat and drought, and are able to increase the ecophysiological adaptability of the leaves and fine roots within certain temperature and humidity ranges. In particular, under compounded conditions, heat and drought have a synergistic effect on growth performance in plants. Extreme drought, however, results in damage to gas exchange mechanisms in leaves, as well as an impaired water intake in leaves and fine roots. Therefore, I. barbatus is not suitable for long-term cultivation under extreme drought condition, as high temperatures will aggravate the aforementioned damage.","[Li, Wei Cheng; Tian, Xin Li; Bi, Yu Fang] China Natl Bamboo Res Ctr, Key Lab High Efficient Proc Bamboo, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Wei Cheng] Southwest Forestry Univ, Coll Life Sci, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Sheng, Hai Yan] Hangzhou Environm Protect Sci Inst, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Forestry; China National Bamboo Research Center, CAF; Southwest Forestry University - China","Sheng, HY (corresponding author), Hangzhou Environm Protect Sci Inst, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.","lee_caf@163.com","","","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Nonprofit Research Institution of CAF [CAFYBB2017MA024]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LY14C030008]","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Nonprofit Research Institution of CAF; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province)","Authors thank Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Nonprofit Research Institution of CAF (CAFYBB2017MA024) and Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LY14C030008) for financial support to carry out this research work.",NA,"22","0","0","3","20","PAKISTAN BOTANICAL SOC","KARACHI","DEPT OF BOTANY UNIV KARACHI, 32 KARACHI, PAKISTAN","0556-3321","2070-3368","","PAK J BOT","Pak.

This study was carried out to determine the SOM budget under grain farming in the Chernozem soil of northern Kazakhstan through the analysis of in situ soil respiration and soil environmental factors such as soil temperature as well as moisture content. Five experimental plots including one fallow field were established at the experimental farm of Barayev Kazakh Research and Production Center of Grain Farming, Shortandy, northern Kazakhstan (mean annual precipitation and average year temperature are 323 mm and 1.6degreesC, respectively). Mean daily soil temperature increased to above 0degreesC in early April, remaining at above 20degreesC from mid-June to mid-August, and then sharply decreased to below 5degreesC at the end of September. Most of the biological activities were considered to be limited from April to September. On the other hand, the soil moisture content remained high after thawing until mid-June and then continuously decreased in the cropped plots except during the rainfall events. The soil respiration rate recorded the highest values from late June to early July and overall fluctuations were similar to those of the soil temperature, unlike the fluctuations of soil microbial C and N contents, which exhibited similar patterns to those of the soil moisture content. In order to, represent the daily soil respiration rates using the soil environmental factors, the following relationship was introduced as a model function: Cem = aM(b)exp(-E/RT). The coefficients, a, b, and E (activation energy in Arrbenius equation), were determined by stepwise multiple regression after logarithm transformation using the measured data, Cem (daily soil respiration rate), M (volumetric soil moisture content), and T (absolute soil temperature). As a result, a significant relationship was always obtained between the soil respiration rate and the activation energy, E, while the contribution of the soil moisture content to the soil respiration rate was uncertain. Using the regression equations and monitored data of soil temperature and moisture content, cumulative soil respiration throughout the cropping period was calculated to be in the range of 2.5 to 3.2 Mg C ha(-1). On the other hand, the amounts of crop residues in the cropped plots that were expected to be incorporated into the soils ranged from 1.6 to 4.4 Mg C ha-1. Except for the plot planted with oats (higher amounts of residues than for wheat), the SOM budget was slightly negative in this year, that is, the soils lost their organic matter stock. Although it is difficult to generalize the C budget in different years because of the large variations in crop growth due to fluctuating water resources, the disadvantage of summer fallow (no residues) was obvious in terms of SOM budget. The net soil respiration rate in the fallow plot, 2.9 Mg C ha(-1), was approximately equivalent to 4% of the total SOM stock in the plow layer (30 cm) (70 to 80 Mg C ha(-1)). To reduce further loss of SOM, at least evenly extensive use of summer fallow should be reconsidered.","Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; Barayev Kazakh Res & Prod Ctr Grain Farming, Shortandy 4740704, Kazakhstan; Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Kyoto 6068501, Japan","Kyoto University; Barayev Research & Production Center for Grain Farming; Kyoto University","Funakawa, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.","","","Funakawa, Shinya/0000-0003-2989-9235","","","",NA,"18","12","13","0","18","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0038-0768","1747-0765","","SOIL SCI PLANT NUTR","Soil Sci.

In the growing season of 1998, 4-year-old peach trees (Prunus persica Batsch cv. 'Suncrest', grafted on 'GF 677' rootstock) were studied under two irrigation treatments, 25 l day(-1) and no irrigation, and during recovery. Trials were conducted near Pisa (Italy) in a peach orchard situated on a medium clay loam soil and equipped with a drip-irrigation system (four 4 l h(-1) drippers per tree). Measurements of leaf water potential (Psi(W)), stem water potential (Psi(S)), and leaf temperature (T-1) were taken over 5 days (from dawn to sunset) and analyzed in conjunction with climatic data, sap flow (SF), trunk diameter fluctuation (TDF) and soil water content (SWC). Physiological indicators showed substantial differences in sensitivity. The first indication of changes in water status was the decrease of stem radial growth. TDF and SF revealed significant differences between the two irrigation treatments even in the absence of differences in pre-dawn leaf water potential (pdPsi(W)), up until now widely accepted as the benchmark of water status indicators. Irrigated trees showed a typical trend in SF rate during the day, while in non-irrigated plants the maximum peak of transpiration was anticipated. Measurements of water potential showed Psi(S) to be a better indicator of tree water status than Psi(W). T-l was found to have poor sensitivity. In conclusion, we found the sensitivity of the indicators from the most to the least was: TDF > SF rate > SF cumulated = pdPsi(W) = Psi(S) > mdPsi(W) > T-l.","Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Coltivaz & Difesa Specie Legnose, I-56124 Pisa, Italy","University of Pisa","Remorini, D (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Coltivaz & Difesa Specie Legnose, Via Borghetto 80, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.","dremorin@agr.unipi.it","Remorini, Damiano/A-2479-2009; Remorini, Damiano/AAS-4258-2020; MASSAI, ROSSANO/A-7497-2018","Remorini, Damiano/0000-0001-8924-6012; Remorini, Damiano/0000-0001-8924-6012; MASSAI, ROSSANO/0000-0002-0182-957X","","","",NA,"28","117","135","2","6","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0342-7188","1432-1319","","IRRIGATION SCI","Irrig.

While ecologists have long accounted for such nonhomogeneous demography in deterministic population models, nonhomogeneous stochastic population models are largely absent from the literature. This is especially the case for models that use exact stochastic methods, such as Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), which commonly assumes that demographic rates do not respond to external environmental change (i.e., assumes homogeneous demography). In other words, ecologists are currently accounting for the effects of demographic stochasticity or environmental variability, but not both. In this paper, we describe an extension of Gillespie's SSA (SSA + ) that allows for nonhomogeneous demography and examine how its predictions differ from a method that is partly naive to environmental change (SSAn) for two fundamental ecological models (exponential and logistic growth). We find important differences in the predicted population sizes of SSA + versus SSAn simulations, particularly when demography responds to fluctuating and irregularly changing environments. Further, we outline a computationally inexpensive approach for estimating when and under what circumstances it can be important to fully account for nonhomogeneous demography for any class of model.","[Legault, Geoffrey; Melbourne, Brett A.] Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Legault, Geoffrey] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA","University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","Legault, G (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.","geoffrey.legault@colorado.edu","","MELBOURNE, BRETT/0000-0002-8843-4131; Legault, Geoffrey/0000-0003-2136-587X","National Science Foundation [1457660]; University of Colorado Boulder","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Colorado Boulder","In this study, preliminary simulation work used the Janus supercomputer, which is supported by the National Science Foundation (DEB, award number 1457660) and the University of Colorado Boulder.",NA,"82","4","4","0","15","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1874-1738","1874-1746","","THEOR ECOL-NETH","Theor.

Rainbow trout were grown with an FCR of 0.97 from 83 to 697 g over 111 days (specific growth rate (SGR), 1.91%/day) between June and September, when average daily water temperatures ranged from 12.3 to 18.2 degrees C. Over the same time period, mulloway grew only from 100 to 116 g, however, once temperatures increased to approximately 21 degrees C in October, food intake increased and mulloway grew to an average size of 384 g over 174 days with an SGR and FCR of 0.68%/day and 1.39, respectively. Barramundi stocked in November with an average weight of 40 g increased to 435 g in 138 days (SGR 1.73%/day) with an FCR of 0.90. The SIFTS significantly reduced nutrient input into the pond by removing settleable wastes as a thick sludge with a dry matter content of 5-10%. The total quantity of dry waste removed over the culture period was 527 kg (5 tonnes/(ha year)), which was calculated to contain 15 kg of nitrogen (144 kg/(ha year)) and 16 kg of phosphor-us (153 kg/(ha year)). The release of soluble nutrients into the pond resulted in blooms of macro- and micro-algae which caused large and potentially lethal diurnal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen within the pond, however, comparatively stable levels of dissolved oxygen were maintained within each SIFT1 through the use of air lift pumps.

Treatments included no-till/no soybean (NTNS), no-till plus soybean (NTS), tillage/no soybean (TNS), and tillage plus soybean (TS). Emergence was monitored from an artificial seed bank in 2004 and a natural seed bank in 2005. Overall, common cocklebur emerged from early May through late October and presented multiple emergence. In no-till plots with or without soybean, initial emergence was delayed 7 d in both years. In TNS plots, major emergence (daily emergence > mean emergence plus standard deviation) of common cocklebur occurred from early May to late July. In NTNS plots, major emergence occurred from late May through late August. No-till reduced total common cocklebur emergence by 59 to 69% compared with tillage. At the V5 to V6 soybean growth stage, the daily soil thermal fluctuation at 2.5 cm soil depth diminished from approximately 15 to 5 C and reduced common cocklebur emergence by 84 to 91% for the rest of the growing season. Common cocklebur emergence was higher when the mean soil temperature was > 15 C, and the daily thermal fluctuation was > 7.5 C. This study suggests that strategies that promote early crop canopy development and minimum tillage should reduce common cocklebur emergence.","Clemson Univ, Dept Plant Soil & Entomol Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","Clemson University","Oliveira, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Crop & Soil Environm Sci, Fayetteville, AR 72704 USA.","jnorswor@uark.edu","Norsworthy, Jason/GXZ-5733-2022","Norsworthy, Jason/0000-0002-7379-6201","","","",NA,"45","12","17","0","4","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","0043-1745","1550-2759","","WEED SCI","Weed Sci.","SEP-OCT","2007","55","5","",NA,"",NA,"474","480","","10.1614/WS-07-003.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WS-07-003.1","","","7","Agronomy; Plant Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture; Plant Sciences","206FQ",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000249169700011","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Thus, germination and seedling establishment are essential processes in the life history of these plants, as they determine their distribution, survival, and abundance. Few studies have examined germination and early seedling development of the Mexican species of this family. In this paper, we experimentally evaluated the influence of light quality (white, red, far red, and darkness), storage time (three months, six months, and 10 years) and temperature (constant 25 degrees C and alternate 15-25 degrees C) on Noveloa coulteriana germination. Seeds were positive photoblastic, and showed high germination capacity in white and red light treatments (>80%). In contrast to previously studied Mexican podostemads, N. coulteriana seeds are recalcitrant. Seeds were also thermoblastic; germination rate was slower in alternate temperature compared to constant temperature. Additionally, using electron microscopy, we observed ex situ seedling development during one month (until its senescence). Micromorphologically, N. coulteriana seedlings showed the characteristic developmental pattern of the subfamily Podostemoideae, where the embryonic shoot and root meristems are lost. Our results indicate that environmental factors such as light quality or temperature fluctuation modify seed germination of N. coulteriana and may play an important role in the reestablishment of natural populations.

Such a MiniFACE system allowed the elevation of CO2 concentration of small field plots avoiding the occurrence of large spatial and temporal fluctuations. A CO2 enrichment field experiment was conducted in Italy in the season 1993-1994 with wheat (cv. Super-dwarf Mercia). A randomized experimental design was used with the treatment combination CO2 x soil N, replicated twice. Gas exchange measurements showed that photosynthetic capacity was significantly decreased in plants exposed to elevated CO2 and grown under nitrogen deficiency. Photosynthetic acclimation was, in this case, due to the occurrence of reduced rates of rubP saturated and rubP regeneration limited photosynthesis. Gas exchange measurements did not instead reveal any significant effect of elevated CO2 on the photosynthetic capacity of leaves of plants well fertilized with nitrogen, in spite of a transitory negative effect on rubP regeneration limited photosynthesis that was detected to occur in the central part of a day with high irradiance. It is concluded that the levels of nitrogen fertilization will play a substantial role in modulating CO2 fertilization effects on growth and yields of wheat crops under the scenario of future climate change.","CESIA,ACCAD GEORGOFILI,I-50122 FLORENCE,ITALY","","Miglietta, F (corresponding author), CNR,INST AGROMETEOROL & ENVIRONM ANAL,IATA,P CASCINE 18,I-50144 FLORENCE,ITALY.","","bindi, marco/M-6415-2014; Miglietta, Franco/A-1257-2009","bindi, marco/0000-0002-8968-954X; Miglietta, Franco/0000-0003-1474-8143; Giuntoli, Alberto/0000-0002-6672-0241","","","",NA,"40","54","57","0","30","KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL","DORDRECHT","SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0166-8595","","","PHOTOSYNTH RES","Photosynth.

Seasonal dynamics of soil phosphorus (P) and associated microbial properties were investigated in upper (0-5 cm) soils under adjacent unimproved grassland and a 19-year-old forest stand (mixture of Pinus ponderosa and Pinus nigra). Afforestation of grassland ameliorated upper soil moisture and temperature regimes, resulting in reduced but less variable soil moisture beneath forest, and reduced temperature extremes, with soil being cooler under forest in summer, but warmer in winter. Results from this, study showed that levels of soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N) and organic P fractions under grassland were consistently higher, but levels of inorganic P fractions (bicarbonate extractable Pi and total Pi), microbial biomass C and P, and phosphatase enzyme activities were lower compared with forest over all seasons. Similar seasonal patterns of soil P fractions under grassland and forest demonstrated that labile organic P was mineralized by increasing microbial activity to meet increasing plant demand in spring and summer, but accumulated as a result of increased organic inputs, slower plant growth and low microbial activity in late autumn and winter. It was concluded that P, recycling was mainly driven by plant P demand and sustained by root litter inputs in the grassland ecosystem and leaf litter inputs in the forest ecosystem. Seasonal changes in environmental conditions (rainfall, soil moisture and temperature) influenced microbial processes involved in P cycling. Microbial biomass plays a pivotal role in P cycling. Annual release of P through microbial biomass was higher in the forest soil (16.1 kg ha(-1)) than in the grassland soil (13.9 kg ha(-1)). The turnover rate of biomass P was also higher in the forest soil (1.28 per year) than in the grassland soil (0.80 per year). In addition, abundant C and P (particularly labile forms) and high microbial and enzyme activities found in the forest floor highlight the importance of the forest floor in P cycling.

We measured the root length density (RLD) and the rate of root production and mortality over 3 yr using minirhizotrons, and compared these rates with temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and plant area indices (PAI). We also measured the FRB and the necromass of fine roots four times per year for 2 yr using soil cores and calculated dry weight-based FRP and FRM. FRB in the uppermost 15 cm of the surface-soil layer accounted for 41-61% of the biomass up to 60 cm soil depth, and decreased with increasing soil depth. The biomass of fine roots with root diameters <0.5 mm was almost equivalent to that of roots measuring 0.5-2 mm in diameter. Sasa roots accounted for 59-88% of the total FRB. FRB did not fluctuate seasonally, whereas RLD did. The FRP rate was high in mid- to late summer and correlated significantly with air and soil temperatures, indicating that temperature affects FRP. However, the relationship between FRP and soil moisture was weak. FRP was significantly correlated with the PAI of oak trees and the increment in the PAI of Sasa, suggesting that endogenous factors also affect FRP. Depending on the method used to calculate turnover, mean FRP for the 3-year study period was 589 or 726 g m(2) yr(-1), accounting for 36% or 41% of forest net primary production, respectively. The results of this study illustrate the substantial seasonal and interannual fluctuations in FRP, and indicate that a significant proportion of assimilated carbon was allocated to below-ground root systems in an oak-Sasa stand.

In this study, tolerance to freezing of vegetative and resting cells of 17 polar and nine temperate diatom strains, belonging to different morphospecies and originating from both freshwater and terrestrial habitats, was experimentally tested. Most strains were newly isolated from sites in Maritime Antarctica (James Ross Island and Vega Island), the High Arctic (Spitsbergen) and Europe. Cultures were exposed to five freezing treatments differing in temperature (-4, -20, -40 and -180 degrees C), freezing rate (gradual, abrupt), time (1 h, 12 h) and thawing rate (slow, fast). Results indicated that diatoms were sensitive to experimental freezing. Freezing temperatures had a significant effect on strain survival: all strains survived -4 degrees C; most survived -20 degrees C; five survived -40 and four of these (all belonging to the Pinnularia borealis complex) survived freezing in liquid nitrogen (-180 degrees C). The cooling and thawing rate had a significant impact on survival: abrupt cooling and slow thawing resulted in much lower survival rates than gradual cooling and fast thawing. Resting cells showed better growth than vegetative cells after freezing treatment but only in the -4 degrees C treatment. Surprisingly, no striking differences in growth recovery were observed between polar and temperate strains.","[Hejdukova, Eva; Nedbalova, Linda] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Vinicna 7, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Pinseel, Eveline; Vanormelingen, Pieter; Vyverman, Wim; Sabbe, Koen] Univ Ghent, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, PAE, Krijgslaan 281-S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Pinseel, Eveline] Meise Bot Garden, Res Dept, Nieuwelaan 38, B-1860 Meise, Belgium; [Pinseel, Eveline] Univ Antwerp, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Ecosyst Management Res Grp ECOBE, Univ Pl 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium; [Nedbalova, Linda; Elster, Josef] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, CZ-37982 Trebon, Czech Republic; [Elster, Josef] Univ South Bohemia, Ctr Polar Ecol, Fac Sci, Na Zlate Stoce 3, CZ-37005 Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Charles University Prague; Ghent University; University of Antwerp; Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice","Hejdukova, E (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Ecol, Vinicna 7, CZ-12844 Prague 2, Czech Republic.","eva.hejdukova@natur.cuni.cz","Nedbalová, Linda/AFF-8321-2022; Nedbalová, Linda/AAF-1001-2022; Hejdukova, Eva/N-2502-2017; Pinseel, Eveline/ABF-5980-2020; Nedbalová, Linda/D-2792-2009","Nedbalová, Linda/0000-0003-1800-714X; Nedbalová, Linda/0000-0003-1800-714X; Hejdukova, Eva/0000-0002-1967-0253; Pinseel, Eveline/0000-0002-1801-2187; Nedbalová, Linda/0000-0003-1800-714X; Sabbe, Koen/0000-0001-5163-5581","Grant Agency of Charles University [20217]; Charles University Mobility grant; Fund for Scientific Research -Flanders (FWO-Flanders, Belgium) [2010-0096]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [LM2015078]; Argentine Antarctic Institute [2010-0096]; Hlavka Foundation;  [RVO67985939]","Grant Agency of Charles University; Charles University Mobility grant; Fund for Scientific Research -Flanders (FWO-Flanders, Belgium)(FWO); Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic); Argentine Antarctic Institute; Hlavka Foundation; ","The research was supported by the Grant Agency of Charles University (Project No. 20217), a Charles University Mobility grant, the Hlavka Foundation, Institutional Research Concept RVO67985939 (funding to EH, LN, JE), and the Fund for Scientific Research -Flanders (FWO-Flanders, Belgium, funding to EP).

The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in microbial biomass due to tillage in relation to N mineralization and to assess the contribution to the N supply of sugar beet. For this purpose, in a field trial near Gottingen in 1995 microbial biomass and net N mineralization were determined in an in situ incubation of ploughed and reduced tilled soil in plots which were not given application of mineral N fertilizer. In reduced tilled soil the increase in mineral N concentration in the upper 10 cm of soil was mainly attributed to an increase in microbial biomass. The organic matter was more easily decomposable, indicated by the increase in C-mic/C-org and N-mic/N-t ratios; this was further supported by the enhanced turnover of microbial biomass in reduced tillage plots. A regression function was used to relate seasonal fluctuations of microbial biomass, soil moisture and soil temperature to N mineralization rate, There was it good agreement between measured and calculated N mineralization rate. Reduced tillage affected N mineralization by affecting the quantity and quality of microbial biomass. In 0-30 cm soil depth 169 kg N/ha were mineralized, 30 kg more N than in ploughed soil. However, despite improved N availability, the N uptake of sugar beet was decreased in reduced tilled soil. Because the N concentration in plants did not differ, it was concluded that sugar beet growth in reduced tilled soil was impaired due to other factors than N supply.","UNIV GOTTINGEN, INST AGR CHEM, D-37075 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY","University of Gottingen","Hoffmann, C (corresponding author), INST ZUCKERRUBENFORSCH, HOLTENSER LANDSTR 77, D-37079 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY.","","","Hoffmann, Christa/0000-0002-8673-7016","","","",NA,"25","15","15","0","11","WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH","WEINHEIM","POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY","0044-3263","","","Z PFLANZ BODENKUNDE","Z.

Energy is primarily used for temperature control, reduction of air humidity, increase of light intensity and CO2 supply. Use of fossil energy can be reduced by limiting the energy demand of the system and decreasing energy losses, by intelligent climate control, by increasing the energy efficiency of the crop and by replacing fossil energy sources by sustainable ones. Energy requirement of the greenhouse can be lowered up to 20-30% by using greenhouse covers with higher insulating values and the use of energy screens. A prerequisite is that these materials should not involve considerable light loss, since this would result in a loss of production. In energy efficient greenhouse concepts, durable energy sources should be included. In (semi-) closed greenhouses, the excess of solar energy in summer is collected and stored in aquifers to be reused in winter to heat the greenhouse. Ventilation windows are closed, with specific benefits to the crop: high CO2 levels can be maintained, and temperature and humidity can be controlled to the needs of the crop. Development of new greenhouse concepts is ongoing. Current examples are greenhouse systems which convert natural energy sources such as solar energy into high-value energy such as electricity. Given a certain technical infrastructure of the greenhouse, energy consumption can be further reduced by energy efficient climate control and crop management. Essential elements are to allow fluctuating temperatures, lower crop transpiration, allow higher humidities, make efficient use of light and create fluent transitions in set points. Consequences for plant growth are related to rate of development, photosynthesis, assimilate distribution, transpiration and the occurrence of diseases or disorders. Since processes involved are complex, knowledge exchange between researchers and growers is essential to realize the goals set to reduce the energy consumption.","[Dieleman, J.

When the quality of food available was increased, by adding a mixture of litter from herbaceous dicotyledonous plants to a background low-quality food of dead grasses, survivorship was found to be the most phenotypically plastic trait, increasing by 168%. Growth rates increased by 99% but reproductive allocation by only 21%. In the field, members of a population from a site with more high-quality food grew more than twice as fast as those from a site where less high-quality food was available. The population from the site with higher food availability, contrary to predictions from the laboratory study, did not survive as well as that from the site with less available high-quality food. This may be because the site that is more favourable for growth has a more stressful physical environment due to much bigger temperature fluctuations, which are known to be an important cause of mortality in this species. When individuals from both populations were reared under controlled laboratory conditions, both the parental and F1 generations from the poor growth environment survived better than those from the good growth habitat. However, even when given an excess of high-quality food those from the poor growth environment continued to grow more slowly and had a lower reproductive allocation than those from the site with higher food availability. We conclude that microevolutionary changes may have occurred in the balance of resource allocation between survivorship, growth and reproductive allocation, to favour higher survivorship during the longer prereproductive period at the site where growth to the threshold size for reproduction takes longer.","Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England","University of East Anglia","Hassall, M (corresponding author), Univ E Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Ctr Ecol Evolut & Conservat, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.","m.hassall@uea.ac.uk","Benton, Tim G/C-6493-2009","Benton, Tim G/0000-0002-7448-1973","","","",NA,"30","13","13","2","24","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0029-8549","1432-1939","","OECOLOGIA","Oecologia","SEP","2003","137","1","",NA,"",NA,"85","89","","10.1007/s00442-003-1325-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-003-1325-1","","","5","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","727RZ","12827489","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000185674200010","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In all substrates, water-filled pore space and water holding capacities were larger and air filled pore space was smaller. Bulk densities, water holding capacity and water-filled, air-filled and total pore spaces were lower in carbonated rice husk than coconut coir and rock wool. These values in coconut coir and carbonated rice husk were much increased with use.

There were no significant differences in plant height, stem diameter, individual fruit weight, percent fruit set, harvest index, ascorbic acid, total soluble solid, fruit pH, leaf chlorophyll contents, root dry matter percentage, fruit dry matter percentage and shoot/root ratio. There was less fluctuation in absolute growth rate, relative growth rate, net assimilate rate and leaf area ratio among the treatments. It also appeared that carbonated rice husk and coconut coir gave better crop performance and yield of tomatoes than rock wool under high temperature stress conditions namely 30degreesC and 35degreesC as compared with 25degreesC. Furthermore, crop productivity from the organic substrate coconut coir gave more profit than the popular rock wool.

In this study, the locally parameterized Biome-BGC model, generated with long-term meteorological monitoring data, was used to simulate net primary productivity (NPP) and carbon density of the vegetation layer, the litter layer, and the soil layer for various forest types from 1992 to 2012 in this area. The total and unitary forest NPP presented obvious annual fluctuation under the combined influences of land use change and extreme weather events. Apart from the year 2006, from 1992 to 2012, the NPP values of each forest type showed an increasing trend, although the growth rates decreased. In 2006, due to abnormally high air temperatures and less precipitation, total and unit area forest NPP values decreased by 46.3% and 53.9%, respectively, compared to 2002. From 1992 to 2012, the carbon stocks of the forest vegetation layer, the litter layer, the soil layer, and the entire area gradually increased with decreasing growth rates. Additionally, forest carbon stocks were high in the east and the south and low in the west and the north. Generally, the forest productivity is greatly affected by the physiological and ecological characteristics of the plants themselves as well as the environmental factors, whereas total forest productivity is largely influenced by human activities. The increase in forest area and the optimization of the forest landscape pattern could improve the forest productivity and carbon sequestration.","[Chen, Yaru; Xiao, Wenfa] Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yaru; Xiao, Wenfa] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yaru] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Natl Forestry Grassland Econ & Dev Res Ctr, Beijing 100714, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Forestry; Research Institute of Forest Ecology, Environment and Protection, CAF","Xiao, WF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Res Inst Forest Ecol Environm & Protect, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.;Xiao, WF (corresponding author), Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.","chenyaru09@126.com; xiaowenf@caf.ac.cn","","","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China: Ministry of Finance [GYHY201406035]","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China: Ministry of Finance","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China: Ministry of Finance: GYHY201406035.",NA,"47","10","10","15","48","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1999-4907","","","FORESTS","Forests","FEB","2019","10","2","",NA,"",NA,"","","149","10.3390/f10020149","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10020149","","","17","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","HO2KP",NA,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000460744000073","View Full Record in Web of Science"

During the period 1986-2007, although there was no temporal trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO), the decadal mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the Celtic Sea increased by 0.66 +/- 0.02 degrees C. Despite this, there was only a weak signal of climate change in the Celtic Sea food web. Changes in plankton community structure were found, however this was not related to SST or NAO. A negative relationship occurred between herring abundance (0- and 1-group) and spring SST ( 0- group: p = 0.02, slope = -0.30560.125; 1-group: p = 0.04, slope = -0.410 +/- 0.193). Seabird demographics showed complex species-specific responses. There was evidence of direct effects of spring NAO ( on black-legged kittiwake population growth rate: p = 0.03, slope = 0.0314 +/- 0.014) as well as indirect bottom- up effects of lagged spring SST (on razorbill breeding success: p = 0.01, slope = -0.144 +/- 0.05). Negative relationships between breeding success and population growth rate of razorbills and common guillemots may be explained by interactions between mid-trophic level fish. Our findings show that the impacts of climate change on the Celtic Sea ecosystem is not as marked as in nearby regions (e.g. the North Sea), emphasizing the need for more research at regional scales.","[Lauria, Valentina; Votier, Stephen C.] Univ Plymouth, Marine Biol & Ecol Res Ctr, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Attrill, Martin J.] Univ Plymouth, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Pinnegar, John K.] CEFAS, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England; [Brown, Andrew] Natural England, Peterborough, Cambs, England; [Edwards, Martin] Sir Alister Hardy Fdn Ocean Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England","University of Plymouth; University of Plymouth; Centre for Environment Fisheries & Aquaculture Science","Lauria, V (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland, Dept Earth & Ocean Sci, Martin Ryan Inst, Galway, Ireland.","valentina.lauria@nuigalway.ie","Pinnegar, John K/C-4400-2012; Lauria, Valentina/R-9053-2018; Votier, Stephen C/G-2348-2014; Lauria, Valentina/AAG-4906-2021","Lauria, Valentina/0000-0002-4179-9133; Votier, Stephen C/0000-0002-0976-0167; Attrill, Martin/0000-0002-4039-031X; Pinnegar, John/0000-0001-5061-9520","Plymouth University; Natural England; Natural Environment Research Council [SAH01001] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [SAH01001] Funding Source: UKRI","Plymouth University; Natural England; Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC))","This work was co-financed by Plymouth University and Natural England (PhD studentship).

These changes could be associated with changes in some relevant population parameters such as the equilibrium density or the maximum population growth rate. However, changes in these parameters have very different consequences. An increase in equilibrium density results in a higher variance in population fluctuations according to the relationship between mean and variance described by Taylor's power law, but does not modify the stability properties of the system. On the other hand, changes in the maximum growth rate induce changes in the dynamic regimes and stability properties of the population. In this study, using statistical and mathematical methods borrowed from econometrics and engineering, we identify structural changes to the variance in the population dynamics of the sycamore aphid Drepanosiphum platanoidis and the green spruce aphid Elatobium abietinum in the UK. Some localities showed strong changes in their population parameters, such that their dynamic regime changed completely. These changes in the population dynamic regimes increase the expected frequency of outbreaks, which has enormous economic and ecological consequences. Through this study we show the application of methods that could be helpful to pest and wildlife managers in the task of evaluating changes in the risk of outbreaks or extinction of animal populations under changing global environmental scenarios.","[Estay, Sergio A.] Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ecol & Evoluc, Fac Ciencias, Valdivia 567, Chile; [Estay, Sergio A.; Lima, Mauricio] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Ctr Adv Studies Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago 6513677, Chile; [Labra, Fabio A.] Univ Santo Tomas, Fac Ciencias, Ctr Invest Ciencias Ambient CIENCIA UST, Santiago 146, Chile; Inst Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago 653, Chile; [Harrington, Richard] Plant & Invertebrate Ecol Dept, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England; [Harrington, Richard] Ctr Bioenergy & Climate Change, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England","Universidad Austral de Chile; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Universidad Santo Tomas","Estay, SA (corresponding author), Univ Austral Chile, Inst Ecol & Evoluc, Fac Ciencias, Valdivia 567, Chile.","sergio.estay@gmail.com","Lima, Mauricio/F-2722-2013; Labra, Fabio A/B-6992-2013","Lima, Mauricio/0000-0002-3700-2945; Labra, Fabio A/0000-0003-2881-3313; Estay, Sergio/0000-0002-3797-8964","FONDAP-FONDECYT [1501-0001]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom","FONDAP-FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYTCONICYT FONDAP); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC))","SAE and ML acknowledge financial support from FONDAP-FONDECYT grant 1501-0001 (Program 2).

However, the system exhibits low to moderate (2-20 mug l(-1)) microalgal biomass with sporadic phytoplankton blooms. Both nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P) limitation of phytoplankton growth have been proposed for the estuary. However, shifts between N and P limitation of algae growth may occur due to annual fluctuations in nutrient concentrations. The primary goal of this work was to determine the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton in Galveston Bay. Nutrient addition bioassays were used to assess short-term (1-2 days) phytoplankton responses (both biomass and community composition) to potentially limiting nutrients. The experimental bioassays were conducted over an annual cycle using natural water collected from the center to lower part of the estuary. Total phytoplankton biomass increased in the nitrate (10 PM) additions in 11 of the 13 bioassays, but no significant increases were detected in the phosphate (3 muM)-only additions. Bioassay results suggest that the phytoplankton community was usually not phosphate limited. All major groups increased in biomass following nitrate additions but diatoms increased in biomass at a faster rate than other groups, shifting the community composition toward higher relative abundance of diatoms. The results of this study suggest that pulsed N input events preferentially favor increases in diatom biomass in this estuary. The broader implications of this study are that N pulsing events, primarily due to river discharge, play an important role in structuring the phytoplankton community in the Galveston Bay estuary.

Quantitative mathematical modeling can improve our understanding of these phenomena. To identify general patterns of microbial responses to multiple stressors in radioactive environments, we analyzed three data sets on: (1) bacteria isolated from soil contaminated by nuclear waste at the Hanford site (USA); (2) fungi isolated from the Chernobyl nuclear-power plant (Ukraine) buildings after the accident; (3) yeast subjected to continuous.-irradiation in the laboratory, where radiation dose rate and cell removal rate were independently varied. We applied generalized linear mixed-effects models to describe the first two data sets, whereas the third data set was amenable to mechanistic modeling using differential equations. Machine learning and information-theoretic approaches were used to select the best-supported formalism( s) among biologically-plausible alternatives. Our analysis suggests the following: (1) Both radionuclides and co-occurring chemical contaminants (e.g. NO2) are important for explaining microbial responses to radioactive contamination. (2) Radionuclides may produce non-monotonic dose responses: stimulation of microbial growth at low concentrations vs. inhibition at higher ones. (3) The extinction-defining critical radiation dose rate is dramatically lowered by additional stressors. (4) Reproduction suppression by radiation can be more important for determining the critical dose rate, than radiation-induced cell mortality. In conclusion, the modeling approaches used here on three diverse data sets provide insight into explaining and predicting multi-stressor effects on microbial communities: (1) the most severe effects (e.g. extinction) on microbial populations may occur when unfavorable environmental conditions (e.g. fluctuations of temperature and/or nutrient levels) coincide with radioactive contamination; (2) an organism's radioresistance and bioremediation efficiency in rich laboratory media may be insufficient to carry out radionuclide bioremediation in the field-robustness against multiple stressors is needed.","[Shuryak, Igor] Columbia Univ, Ctr Radiol Res, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Dadachova, Ekaterina] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Radiol, Bronx, NY 10467 USA; [Dadachova, Ekaterina] Albert Einstein Coll Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Bronx, NY 10467 USA","Columbia University; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine; Yeshiva University; Albert Einstein College of Medicine","Shuryak, I (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Ctr Radiol Res, New York, NY 10032 USA.","is144@cumc.columbia.edu","Dadachova, Ekaterina/I-7838-2013","","","","",NA,"50","5","5","1","26","PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE","SAN FRANCISCO","1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA","1932-6203","","","PLOS ONE","PLoS One","JAN 25","2016","11","1","",NA,"",NA,"","","e0147696","10.1371/journal.pone.0147696","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147696","","","17","Multidisciplinary Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Science & Technology - Other Topics","DC9FZ","26808049","Green Published, gold, Green Submitted","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000369527800186","View Full Record in Web of Science"

At the ecosystem level, the gross primary productivity (GPP) refers to the amount of organic carbon fixed by plant bodies. How to accurately estimate the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation productivity of the forest ecosystem in the Altay Mountains in northwest China has become a critical issue to be addressed. The Altay Mountains, with rich forest resources, are located in a semi-arid climate zone and are sensitive to global climate changes, which will inevitably have serious impacts on the function and structure of forest ecosystems in northwest China. In this paper, to reveal the variation trends of vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) and its response to surface meteorological factors in the Altay Mountains in northwest China, daily temperature and precipitation data from the period of 2000-2017 were collected from seven meteorological stations in Altay prefecture and its surrounding areas; the data were analyzed by using the MODIS GPP model, moving average trend analysis, linear regression analysis and the climate tendency rate method. The results show that: (1) The spatial distribution pattern of GPP in the whole year was almost the same as that in the growing season of vegetation in the Altay Mountains. In the whole mountain range, the proportion of the area which had a GPP value of 400-600 g c/m(2) had the highest value; the proportion of the annual and growing season of this area was 41.10% and 40.88%, respectively, which was mainly distributed in the middle and west alpine areas of the Altay Mountains. (2) There was a big gap in the GPP value in the different stages of the vegetation growing season (April to September), which reached the highest value in July, the area with a GPP of 100-150 g c/m(2) was the highest, with 36.15%. (3) The GPP of the Altay Mountains showed an overall increasing trend, but the annual fluctuation was relatively large. In 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2014, the GPP showed lower values, which were 385.18 g c/m(2), 384.90 g c/m(2), 384.49 g c/m(2) and 393.10 g c/m(2), respectively. In 2007, 2011 and 2016, the GPP showed higher values, which were 428.49 g c/m(2), 428.18 g c/m(2) and 446.61 g c/m(2). (4) In 64.85% of the area of the Altay Mountains, the GPP was positively correlated with annual average temperature, and in 36.56% of the area, the correlation coefficient between temperature and GPP ranged from -0.2 to 0. In 71.61% of the area of the Altay Mountains, the GPP was positively correlated with annual accumulated precipitation, and in 28.39% of the area, the GPP was negatively correlated with annual accumulated precipitation. Under the scenario of global climate change, our study has quantitatively analyzed the long-term dynamics of vegetation GPP and its responses to meteorological factors in the Altay Mountains, which would be helpful for evaluating and estimating the variation trends of forest ecosystems in China, and has important guiding significance for policy formulation to protect forest resources and improve the local ecological environment.","[Aili, Aishajiang; Xu, Hailiang; Zhao, Xinfeng; Zhang, Peng; Yang, Ruiqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS","Xu, HL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.","xuhl@ms.xjb.ac.cn","","","","","",NA,"48","1","1","9","9","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","1999-4907","","FORESTS","Forests","NOV","2022","13","11","",NA,"",NA,"","","1907","10.3390/f13111907","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13111907","","","14","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","6V2SJ",NA,"gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000894904100001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A first coupled physical-biological model of A. tamarense blooms was developed for this system in order to explore the interactions between cyst germination, cellular growth and water circulation and to identify the effect of physical processes on bloom development and transport across the estuary. The simulated summer (1998) was characterized by an A. tamarense red tide with concentrations reaching 2.3 x 10(6) cells L-1 along the south shore of the LSLE. The biological model was built with previously observed A. tamarense cyst distribution, cyst germination rate and timing, and A. tamarense growth limitation by temperature and salinity. The coupled model successfully reproduced the timing of the A. tamarense bloom in 1998, its coincidence with the combined plumes from the Manicouagan and Aux-Outardes (M-O) rivers on the north shore of the estuary, and the temporal variations in the north-south gradients in cell concentrations. The simulation results reveal that the interaction between cyst germination and the estuarine circulation generates a preferential inoculation of the surface waters of the M-O river plume with newly germinated cells which could partly explain the coincidence of the blooms with the freshwater plume. Furthermore, the results suggest that the spatio-temporal evolution of the bloom is dominated by alternating periods of retention and advection of the M-O plume: east or northeast winds favor the retention of the plume close to the north shore while west or north-west winds result in its advection toward the south shore. The response of the simulated freshwater plume to fluctuating wind forcing controls the delivery of the A. tamarense bloom from the northern part of the estuary to the south shore. In addition, our results suggest that a long residence time of the M-O plume and associated A. tamarense population in the LSLE during the summer 1998 contributed to the development of the red tide. We thus hypothesize that the wind-driven dynamics of the M-O plume could partly determine the success of A. tamarense blooms in the LSLE by influencing the residence time of the blooms and water column stability, which in turn affects A. tamarense vertical migrations and growth.

The design of control strategies needed in these two cases benefit from a model of the system dynamics. As an example, we modelled closed-loop controllers of a two-level artificial aquatic trophic system consisting of a cladoceran population feeding on algae supplied from a culture. The control of the cladoceran is based on a stage-structured model of its population dynamics and the food density, obtained as a balance of the rates of supply from the algae culture and of consumption by the cladoceran. The animal model assumes that females switch from asexual to sexual reproduction at low food density. The control strategy maintains the animal population in the asexual cycle and is based on two controllers. One to limit animal population growth by harvesting in accordance to food supply availability and another to adjust food supply in order to maintain the food density at a. constant reference level above the threshold for sexual reproduction. Both controllers require real-time estimates of food density and total animal density; however, measurements of animal density by stage (adults and neonates) are assumed to be unavailable. The second controller, a proportional-derivative linear law, maintains the cladoceran in the asexual cycle by avoiding changes in reproductive behavior due to lack of adequate food density. The first controller calculates a harvest rate based on departures of the food consumption from a reference value, which was selected conservatively as only a fraction of food supply availability. Two alternative designs, linear and nonlinear, for the harvest controller were simulated and compared. Simulations of the model system (controllers, animal and food) are employed to investigate the effect of the controllers on short-term stability and transient behavior. All simulations started from zero animal density and a pulse inoculation of resting eggs ready to hatch. After post-inoculation transients, sudden changes in the consumption reference were also implemented to evaluate tracking response to these changes. As expected, the nonlinear control yielded better consumption rate transient behavior for both post-inoculation and tracking. Animal density fluctuations during the post inoculation period were not dampened due to the conservative assumptions of unavailability of real-time measurements of density by stage. We conclude that this control strategy is feasible but that further work is needed for implementation. In future work, we plan to address issues that limit current applicability of the model: generate real data for calibration and validation, extend controls to long-term behavior, and include other limiting factors and processes.

Larval stages of RKC play an important role in determining the spread and recruitment of the population in the coastal waters. We present a review of studies concerned with the ecology of RKC larvae in the Barents Sea focusing on their dynamics and role in the trophic food webs as well as on the role of environmental factors in driving RKC zoeae. Zoeal stages are larger, and their development time is shorter in the Barents Sea compared to the North Pacific. RKC larvae appear in late January-February and can be found in the coastal plankton until mid-July. Mass hatching of RKC larvae in the Barents Sea starts in late March-early April. The highest densities of RKC larvae are located in small semi-enclosed bays and inlets with weak water exchange or local eddies as well as in inner parts of fjords. Size structures of the zoeal populations are similar in the inshore waters to the west of Kola Bay but slightly differ from those in more eastern regions. RKC larvae perform daily vertical migrations and move to deeper depths during bright daylight hours and tend to rise during night hours. RKC larvae are plankton feeders that ingest both phyto- and zooplankton. A set of environmental variables including food conditions, water temperature, and advective influence are the most important factors driving the spatial distribution, phenology, survival rates, development, growth, and interannual fluctuations of RKC larvae. Recent climatic changes in the Arctic may have both negative and positive consequences for RKC larvae.","[Dvoretsky, Vladimir G.; Dvoretsky, Alexander G.] Russian Acad Sci MMBI RAS, Murmansk Marine Biol Inst, Murmansk 183010, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences","Dvoretsky, VG (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci MMBI RAS, Murmansk Marine Biol Inst, Murmansk 183010, Russia.","v-dvoretsky@yandex.ru; ag-dvoretsky@yandex.ru","Dvoretsky, Alexander G./AAP-6435-2021","Dvoretsky, Alexander/0000-0002-4177-960X","Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation","Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation","This study was funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation.",NA,"144","9","9","5","14","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","","2073-4441","","WATER-SUI","Water","AUG","2022","14","15","",NA,"",NA,"","","2328","10.3390/w14152328","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14152328","","","25","Environmental Sciences; Water Resources","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources","3R9BT",NA,"gold","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000839200600001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, stress-induced physiological conditions may arise within the system from factors such as mechanical injury, pests, or inconsistent nutrient flow rates that result in some plants receiving too much or too little water. Most abiotic stress conditions result in increased production of the plant hormone ethylene. High levels of ethylene inhibit growth, cause premature ripening, and induce the onset of senescence, potentially reducing the productivity of hydroponically-grown crops. In this study, we demonstrate that assessing ethylene levels from leaves of hydroponically-grown strawberry plants can be used as an early indicator of stress conditions. Our results demonstrate that there is no significant correlation between ethylene production and temperatures ranging from 15 to 37 degrees C or with light intensities ranging from 63 to 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). However, an increase in ethylene production tended to be positively correlated with sampling time; levels were higher during midday compared to early morning or later afternoon. The daily ethylene fluctuations under greenhouse conditions due to sampling time, light intensity, or temperature changes were not significantly high enough to indicate stress conditions. Overall, three system analyses showed altered ethylene production in plants farthest from the pump supplying the nutrient solution. This effect was interpreted to be caused by excess accumulation of nutrient solution around the plant roots, causing increased ethylene production in the leaves. Our results indicate that different watering patterns, manifested as pump pressure or drainage control, was the more difficult component to control in the design of these hydroponic systems. For example, in one system, an increase in ethylene production was measured for the position farthest from the pump, and resulted in those plants having a lower number of flowers and significantly reduced overall plant radii relative to the system average. In a separate experiment, plants from trays that had been flooded for 24 h showed a significant decrease in the plant radii and number of leaves and flowers I month after the flooding treatment. We conclude that system-wide ethylene measurements can be used to identify stressed plants within hydroponic systems. This type of analysis would be e specially useful as an indicator of general stress conditions no matter the cause, identifying locations that may result in lower plant productivity.

Dry mass (DM) specific oxygen consumption rates varied from 1.4 to 3.3 mu l O(2) (DM)(-1) h(-1), showing a pattern of developmental decline. In contrast, specific ammonia excretion rates fluctuated irregularly from 0.02 to 0.067 mu g NH(4)-N (DM)(-1) h(-1), yielding oxygen consumption to ammonia excretion ratios (O:N atomic ratio) as wide as 51-180. With progressive development, ash decreased from 34% to 17% of DM while C composition increased from 33% to 41% of DM. No consistent changing pattern with development was seen for water contents (74-83% of WM), N composition (6.9-9.5% of DM) and C:N ratios (4.0-5.1). Supplemental data of both specific oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion rates of laboratory-raised Stage III P. homarus and wild Parribacus antarcticus phyllosoma (stage unknown) of this study and literature data on phyllosomas of other lobster species by previous workers were shown to be comparable to those of P. ornatus phyllosomas when the differences in DM and temperature were taken into account. No appreciable differences due to the origin of the specimens, whether wild or laboratory-raised, were evident. Comparison of the present results with those of stomatopod larvae and holoplanktonic crustaceans in the same tropical marine habitats revealed that phyllosoma larvae are characterized by somewhat lower DM specific oxygen consumption rates and N composition. The study revealed markedly reduced ammonia excretion rates in phyllosomas, suggesting reduced swimming activity and preferential utilization of dietary protein to somatic growth rather than metabolism.

Thermal imaging techniques and the heat balance model enable us to estimate canopy diffusive conductance (g(c)) and canopy transpiration rate (E) of crops under field conditions. However, because conventional methods are unstable when wind velocity is very low, it is difficult to apply this model directly to field-grown crops. In this study, we modified the conventional model by measuring aerodynamic resistance in rice (Oryza sativa (L.)) under windless conditions (r(a)*). The r(a)* ranged from 9.50 to 35.40 s m(-1) among the genotypes. By introducing the concept of r(a)* to the original heat balance model, the stability when wind velocity is under 3.0 m s(-1) improved greatly. Using seven rice genotypes, we evaluated genotypic differences in E with higher temporal resolution. The daily cumulative transpiration ranged from 2.32 kgm(-2) d(-1) to 10.29 kg m(-2) d(-1) depending on genotype and weather conditions. High-yielding cultivars consistently showed greater transpiration rates under various weather conditions. We confirmed the relationship between estimated E and final grain yield, especially during the daytime. Our modified model is useful as a monitoring tool for rice canopy transpiration.

The population density fluctuated from 1.0 ind (or 0.0029 mg C) m(-3) to 3,370 ind (or 14.69 mg C) m(-3), with a small, protracted peak in winter and a large, sharp peak in summer. The population consisted of 3 subpopulations, each of which produced 6-7 generations, yielding a total of 19 generations. In most generations, the mortality was notably higher in the egg to small juvenile (body length: ca. 2 mm) stage and in the adult stage than in the large juvenile stage. Basic population parameters, e.g., time to first maturity (range: 32-71 d), minimum size for reproduction (4.0-8.9 mm), mean body length of mature adults (5.5-10.4 mm) and life span (34-96 d), were negatively correlated with temperature. The specific growth rates (0.07-0.22 d(-1)) were a positive function of temperature, yielding an annual population production rate of 91.49 mg C m(-3) y(-1). Only one third of A. crassa contained prey in the gut, and their feeding habit was completely carnivorous, with preference for progressively larger prey with their growth. Estimated carbon weight-specific feeding rates (0.01-0.81 d(-1)) sustained net growth with a mean gross growth efficiency of 45% in warm seasons (>= ca. 15 degrees C). This highly intensive survey of the A. crassa population serves as a benchmark for intra-and interspecific comparisons of ecophysiological and population parameters.","[Uye, Shin-ichi] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci Life, Higashihiroshima 7398528, Japan; [Liang, Dong] JC Environm Co, Higashihiroshima 7390025, Japan","Hiroshima University","Uye, S (corresponding author), Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci Life, Higashihiroshima 7398528, Japan.","suye@hiroshima-u.ac.jp","","","","","",NA,"72","0","0","4","4","PLANKTON SOC JAPAN","HOKKAIDO","C/O MAR.

Newspaper mulch or black plastic reduced total weed biomass >= 90%, and woodchip or NP + grass mulch each reduced total weed biomass 78% compared with bare soil under high rainfall conditions in 2011. In 2012, under low rainfall, all mulches reduced weed biomass 97% or more compared with bare soil. In both years, all mulches resulted in higher squash bug infestations than bare soil. The woodchip, newspaper, and NP + grass mulches retained higher soil moistures than bare soil or black plastic over the course of each growing season, and the woodchip and NP + grass mulches caused greatest fluctuations in soil temperature.

Aquatic gastropods are an ideal organism for studying such effects because they inhabit littoral areas that are frequently dewatered during hydropeaking and have a low dispersal ability making them highly susceptible. We explored mortality rates of Taylorconcha serpenticola, the threatened Bliss Rapids snail, in four laboratory experiments that simulated hydropeaking during varying seasons and varying hydropower operation scenarios. Experiments were conducted in a light and temperature controlled Conviron (R) and were designed to simulate conditions on the Middle Snake River, Idaho, USA, in reaches that are subjected to hydropeaking. Experiments examined the effects of three air temperatures (winter = -7 degrees C, spring = 17 degrees C and summer = 37 degrees C), three durations of exposure to air (2, 4 and 6 h), three dewatering rates (instantaneous, 0.3 and 0.15m h(-1)), two substrate textures (smooth and vesicular) and consecutive daily exposures (1 to 15 days). With 2 h exposures >80% of gastropods survived under both the summer and winter condition, but with 6 h exposure only 60% survived under winter conditions and almost none survived under summer conditions. Survivorship of gastropods was always high under spring conditions (>90%) even when exposed for 6 h d(-1) for up to 15 days. When subjected to consecutive daily exposures, survivorship was lowest under winter conditions. Neither rate of dewatering nor substrate texture affected survivorship. Our data suggest that hydropower operations that include rapid stage fluctuations under extreme temperatures can cause high mortality of sensitive benthic species especially when exposure time is prolonged. Future water management policy decisions will need to consider these factors to manage for protection of aquatic species of conservation concern.

Canopy gaps had low soil moisture and low microbial biomass suggesting that belowground dynamics accompanied changes in light resources after canopy opening. High rainfall in the region causes excessive erosion/leaching of top soil and eventually soil fertility declines in treefall gaps compared to understorey. Soil microbial population was less during periods when temperature and moisture conditions are low, while it peaked during rainy season when the litter decomposition rate is at its peak on the forest floor. Greater demand for nutrients by plants during rainy season (the peak vegetative growth period) limited the availability of nutrients to soil microbes and, therefore, low microbial C, N and P. Weak correlations were also obtained for the relationships between microbial C, N and P and soil physico-chemical properties. Gap size did influence the microbial nutrients and their contribution to soil organic carbon, total Kjeldhal nitrogen and available-P. Contribution of microbial C to soil organic carbon, microbial N to total nitrogen were similar in both treefall gaps and understorey plots, while the contribution of microbial P to soil available-P was lower in gap compared to the understorey.

Therefore, a 42-day laboratory mimetic experiment to determine how growth, biological performance and related carbon and nitrogen metabolic products of the calcifying macroalga, Halimeda opuntia are generated in response to fluctuating pCO(2) under OA conditions (1200 ppmv) was performed. The results of present study showed that the adverse effects of OA were more determined by the adverse influence of elevated acidity (H+) on growth rates, calcification, photosynthesis and the related biotic performance of H. opuntia compared with the positive effects that higher CO2 provided. Moreover, diurnal fluctuations in pCO(2) levels [with higher (nearly 8.10) and lower pH (nearly 7.40) values during day and night times, respectively] have amplified these negative influences on H. opuntia. To mitigate elevated pCO(2)-related stress, higher contents of free amino acids and proline were highly secreted and likely linked to protecting the integrity of algal cellular structures. The above results contribute to increasing our understanding of the biological consequences of pCO(2) (pH) variability on calcifying Halimeda species and their physiological plasticity in response to further oceanic pCO(2) changes.","[Wei, Zhangliang; Zhang, Yating; Yang, Fangfang; Long, Lijuan] Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Chinese Acad Sci CAS Key Lab Trop Marine Bioresour, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wei, Zhangliang; Long, Lijuan] South China Sea Inst Oceanol SCSIO, Guangdong Prov Observat & Res Stn Coastal Upwellin, Shantou, Peoples R China; [Wei, Zhangliang; Long, Lijuan] South China Sea Inst Oceanol SCSIO, Sanya Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Trop Marine Biotechnol Hainan Prov, Sanya, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yating] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Yang, FF; Long, LJ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, South China Sea Inst Oceanol, Chinese Acad Sci CAS Key Lab Trop Marine Bioresour, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.;Long, LJ (corresponding author), South China Sea Inst Oceanol SCSIO, Guangdong Prov Observat & Res Stn Coastal Upwellin, Shantou, Peoples R China.;Long, LJ (corresponding author), South China Sea Inst Oceanol SCSIO, Sanya Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Trop Marine Biotechnol Hainan Prov, Sanya, Peoples R China.","ycuyang@scsio.ac.cn; longlj@scsio.ac.cn","","","Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China [202102021228]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [42006129]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFC3100500, 2021YFF0502801]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province of China [2021B1212050023]; Key Programs of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [E1YD5J01]; Special Research Assistant Grant Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province of China; Key Programs of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Special Research Assistant Grant Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","This research was supported by the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China (202102021228), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (42006129), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC3100500, 2021YFF0502801), Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province of China (2021B1212050023), Key Programs of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (E1YD5J01), and the Special Research Assistant Grant Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",NA,"64","0","0","3","8","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","","2296-7745","","FRONT MAR SCI","Front.

Chemical control is the main control method against B. tabaci; biological control practices, however, have also been applied against this pest, especially in greenhouse production systems. Due to its parasitism potential and adaptation to environmental conditions of the Mediterranean region, Eretmocerus mundus Mercet (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) is considered one of the most successful biological control agents of B. tabaci. In mass production, having adequate numbers of natural enemies is critical for the augmentative biological control programs. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of stored indigenous Er. mundus on B. tabaci under greenhouse conditions. In storage experiments, red-eyed Er. mundus pupae were stored separately for 4, 8 and 12 days at 5 and 10 degrees C with 45 +/- 5% RH conditions. The most suitable storage duration and temperature were determined as 8 days and 10 degrees C for the greenhouse release experiments. In the greenhouse experiments, the treatments consisted of B. tabaci release (control), stored and unstored Er. mundus releases in the Spring of 2015 and 2016 growth seasons. For the evaluation of population development of whitefly and the parasitoid, leaf samples were taken at five-day intervals. In both years, similar parasitism fluctuations were detected in stored and unstored parasitoid-released treatments, wherein initially-lower parasitism rates showed a dramatic increase at later sampling dates. In general, statistical parasitism rates of stored and unstored Er. mundus populations were found in the same group for 2015 and 2016. The results showed that storage of the parasitoid did not have a negative effect on its parasitism ability, and eight-day-stored native strain of Er. mundus could be used successfully in the biological control of B. tabaci in greenhouse-grown tomato plants.","[Kazak, Cengiz; Doker, Ismail; Karaca, Mahmut Mete; Karut, Kamil] Cukurova Univ, Agr Fac, Dept Plant Protect, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey","Cukurova University","Karut, K (corresponding author), Cukurova Univ, Agr Fac, Dept Plant Protect, TR-01330 Adana, Turkey.","ckazak@cu.edu.tr; idoker@cu.edu.tr; mkaraca@cu.edu.tr; karuti@cu.edu.tr","Döker, İsmail/E-5403-2018","Döker, İsmail/0000-0002-1412-1554","TUBITAK (Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey) [TUBITAK -1007-111G150]","TUBITAK (Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK))","This study was supported by TUBITAK (Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey), Grant No: TUBITAK -1007-111G150.",NA,"35","3","3","0","15","ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0261-2194","1873-6904","","CROP PROT","Crop Prot.","NOV","2020","137","","",NA,"",NA,"","","105293","10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105293","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105293","","","6","Agronomy","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture","NJ9YQ",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000566399800027","View Full Record in Web of Science"

About half of the seasonal resupply of nitrate stocks to their initial winter conditions is derived from in situ nitrification, with the rest obtained from deep-sea influxes. Under the present conditions of atmospheric forcing, shelf-break exchange, and food web structure, this shelf ecosystem serves as a sink for atmospheric CO2, with storage in the forms of exported DOC, DIC, and unutilized POC (phytoplankton, bacteria, and fecal pellets). As a consequence of just the rising levels of atmospheric pCO2 since the Industrial Revolution, however, the biophysical CO2 status of the Southeastern Bering Sea shelf may have switched over the last 250 years, from a prior source to the present sink, since this relatively pristine ecosystem has undergone little eutrophication. Such fluctuations of CO2 status may thus be reversed by the physical processes of: (1) reduction of atmospheric pCO2, (2) increased onwelling of deep-sea SIGMACO2, and (3) warming of shelf waters. Based on our application of this model to the Chukchi Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, about 1.0-1.2 gigatons C y-1 of atmospheric CO2 may now be sequestered by temperate and polar shelf ecosystems. When tropical systems are included, however, a positive net sink of only 0.6-0.8 x 10(15)g C y-1 may prevail over all shelves.","","","WALSH, JJ (corresponding author), UNIV S FLORIDA, DEPT MARINE SCI, ST PETERSBURG, FL 33701 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"179","58","60","1","24","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0079-6611","","","PROG OCEANOGR","Prog.

To be useful, the trees must also be able to withstand dry conditions in summer when temperatures can be very high and droughts become severe quickly. Here, we report a study in which mulberry seedlings were grown in a greenhouse under a variety of simulated soil water conditions reflecting potential summer scenarios in the hydro-fluctuation belt of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. We compared the responses of two pretreatment groups of mulberry seedlings to different levels of drought stress. The pretreatment groups differed with respect to drought hardening: the daily-managed (DM) group had relative soil moisture held constant in the range 70-80 %, while the drought-hardened (DH) group had relative soil moisture held constant at 40-50 %. Following the month-long pretreatment of seedlings, the two groups of young trees (DM and DH) were then respectively subjected to three levels of drought stress for a month: normal watering, moderate drought stress, and severe drought stress. A series of measurements comparing the physiological status of the plants in the two groups were then made, and the following results were obtained: (1) As drought stress increased, the heights, base diameters, root surface areas, photosynthetic rates (Pn), stomatal conductances (Gs), and transpiration rates (Tr) of the mulberry trees in both groups (DM and DH) decreased significantly, while the specific root area and abscisic acid (ABA) contents had increasing trends. Root activity and instantaneous water use efficiency of mulberry trees in both groups (DM and DH) were all raised under drought stress conditions than under normal watering, but the root/shoot ratio and leaf water potential were lowered. (2) At the same level of soil water content, the heights, base diameters, root/shoot ratios, root surface areas, specific root areas, photosynthetic rates (Pn), stomatal conductances (Gs), and transpiration rates (Tr) of the young mulberry trees in the DH were all significantly higher than those of the control group (DM). Leaf water potential, instantaneous water use efficiency, and abscisic acid content of DH were all significantly lower than DM. Under different degrees of drought stress, the growth of mulberry trees will be inhibited, but the trees can respond to the stress by increasing the root absorptive area and enhancing capacity for water retention. Mulberry trees demonstrate strong resistance to drought stress, and furthermore drought resistance can be improved by drought hardening during the seedling stage.","[Huang, Xiaohui; Liu, Yun; Li, Jiaxing; Xiong, Xingzheng; Chen, Yang; Yin, Xiaohua] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Three Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenvironm, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China; [Huang, Xiaohui; Feng, Dalan] Chongqing Key Lab Three Gorges Area Forest Ecol P, Chongqing 400036, Peoples R China","Southwest University - China","Liu, Y (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Three Gorges Reservoir Reg Ecoenvironm, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China.","liuyun19970205@163.com","","","Chongqing Key Laboratory of The Three Gorges Area Forest Ecology Protection and Restoration; Key Laboratory of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region's Eco-Environment (Southwest University), Ministry of Education","Chongqing Key Laboratory of The Three Gorges Area Forest Ecology Protection and Restoration; Key Laboratory of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region's Eco-Environment (Southwest University), Ministry of Education","The authors thank Martin Willison of Dalhousie University and Marinus J.A.

There was a pronounced seasonality, not only in the biomass of U. pertusa, but also in photosynthetic performance and in variation in tissue pigments and nutrients. In addition to a primary seasonal response, significant variation in biomass was correlated in parts of the year with nutrient inputs from the surrounding watershed, heavy rain events and summer desiccation. There was a unimodal seasonal pattern in which biomass peaked in May (2.2 kg fw m(-2)) and dropped significantly from June to September. Recovery of Ova mats, as indicated by recruitment of new plants, began during autumn. Photosynthetic rates, maximum photosynthesis (P-max) and photosynthetic efficiency (a) were highest during the growth period and were lowest when biomass peaked or declined in May and July.

However, given that barley is a relatively new crop in this region, basic agronomic information relating to stand assessment is needed. This is particularly relevant in this region, as climatic variability from extreme temperature fluctuations during the winter and spring can reduce a barley stand, creating the need for farmers to estimate grain yield potential. The objective of the research was to evaluate the relationship between spring stem counts, fractional green canopy cover (FGCC), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and barley grain yield. Trials were established at five site-years in Ohio, where seeding rate treatments of 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 million seeds acre(-1) were used to simulate a range of poor to excellent plant stands. All barley stand assessment methods were conducted in the spring at the Feekes 5 growth stage. Stem counts were correlated with FGCC and NDVI measurements (r = .76 and .74, respectively). Stem counts (R-2 = .67) and FGCC (R-2 = .65) measurements accounted for the greatest variability in barley grain yield. Specifically, FGCC <= 5% corresponded to yield between 27 and 39 bu acre(-1), whereas 5 to 10% corresponded to yield between 60 and 89 bu acre(-1). Fractional green canopy cover should be considered as a stand and yield assessment tool, as it reduces labor compared with stem counting techniques.","[McGlinch, Gregory J.; Lindsey, Laura E.] Ohio State Univ, Hort & Crop Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Jacquemin, Stephen J.] Wright State Univ, Agr & Water Qual Educ Ctr, Lake Campus, Celina, OH 45822 USA","University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton","McGlinch, GJ (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Hort & Crop Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.","mcglinch.2@osu.edu","Lindsey, Laura/AAD-3214-2020","Lindsey, Laura/0000-0001-7026-0949","Ohio Small Grains Marketing Program; OARDC SEEDS grant","Ohio Small Grains Marketing Program; OARDC SEEDS grant","We thank the Ohio Small Grains Marketing Program and the OARDC SEEDS grant for funding.

The C-14 age of thin pedogenic carbonate laminae indicate four periods of coating formation: the second half of MIS-3 (24.1-23.3 and similar to 34.0-35.0 kyr BP), from the warm phases of the Late Glacial to the Middle Holocene (12.9-4.6 kyr BP) and the final of the Middle Holocene (3.6-3.3 kyr BP). Thus, studied carbonate coatings are mainly relict feature of the previous epochs of pedogenesis and Middle Holocene stage of surface soil formation. Paleoecological conditions reconstructed for the identified stages of formation of carbonate coatings correlate well with the trend of climatic changes in the Baikal region and adjacent areas. They reflect the effect of temperature and moisture fluctuations on the dynamics of soil-forming processes. Distinct delta O-18 and delta C-13 values suggest that the coatings of Transbaikalian steppes and forest-steppes of Fore-Baikal region have been formed under contrast environmental conditions. It is assumed that the formation of pedogenic carbonates in Transbaikalia is mainly confined to the summer season, when the soil is most warmed up, and the plants actively consume water and emit a large amount of CO2 . This agrees well with the slightly higher temperatures of the warm season and the greater aridity of this region. In turn, carbonate precipitation in Fore-Baikal region occurred during the degassing of soil solutions in the course of periodic freezing and thawing, alternation of phases of snowmelt and rainwater infiltration into the soil and its subsequent freezing, which can be observed in the region in spring and autumn. A significant CaCO3 content in the studied soils contributed to the high growth rates of pendants. Holocene coatings are characterized by maximum growth intensity, which correlates with the highest carbonate content in the slope sediments where they are found. At the same time, MIS-3 coatings formed mainly on significantly less carbonate-rich alluvial deposits, which apparently affected their lower growth intensity.

Established switchgrass stands are very resilient to the environmental fluctuations; however, seed dormancy and weak seedling vigor make establishment difficult. Breaking seed dormancy of switchgrass is a first step to reduce risk of establishment failure and the costs associated with reseeding. Many studies have reported a myriad of methods to break seed dormancy of switchgrass, including chemical, mechanical, thermal, and hormonal seed treatments. Length of seed storage, storage conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity), and prior soil conditions (e.g., soil salinity and fertilizer rates) affect switchgrass seed dormancy. Strong interactions exist among germination, seedling emergence, and soil conditions; therefore, treated seeds tested in soil media will generate more accurate results following dormancy breaking techniques. This paper reviews the current methods used to break switchgrass seed dormancy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

No permanent vertical stratification was found owing to the shallowness of the lake. Both nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll a values indicated highly eutrophic conditions, which are a consequence of a natural enrichment by seabirds. Significant differences in temperature between the 1997 and 1998 seasons strongly influenced most of the biological features. The phytoplankton community showed a high algal species-richness, with important contributions of epilithic, cryobiontic and soil algae. The dominant algal group was Chlorophyta, mainly represented by Chlamydomonas aff. celerrima, followed by Chl. aff. braunii. Some replacement of phytoplanktonic species took place in summer and was more evident in 1998. Picophytoplankton reached high densities, similar to those reported from other Antarctic lakes. Bacterioplankton abundances were typical of eutrophic and hypereutrophic lakes. There was a positive correlation between bacterial and total phytoplankton abundance.

The main input variables are based on greenhouse air temperature and water vapour pressure deficit (VPD). With these variables we synthesized micro-climatic and plant based indicators, which enabled us to model the weekly flowering rate, fruit setting rate and number of set fruits per plant. The statistical relations of this model were obtained by longitudinal data analysis of crop data. A beefsteak tomato crop was grown on soil, on full-scale experiments that took place in Lisbon, Portugal, from February until July of 1998 (calibration experiment) and of 2000 (validation experiment). The presented model will later be used in a wider model, for the simulation of tomato production for the winter-spring cropping cycle.

The experiment was carried out by taking different salinization stage plots under Hordeum vulgare L. and Medicago sativa L. grown fields as the study objects, and by using the method of replacing time with space. Results were as follows: 1) Compared to non-saline plot, soil bulk density was increased by 3.00%, 4.54%, 8.62% and 9.96%, respectively in slightly, moderately, severely and very severely salinized plot in alfalfa grown field, whereas for barley grown field, the change of soil bulk density had no obvious trend in corresponding salinized gradient plots. Soil temperature of different salinized gradient plots in alfalfa grown field showed a low-high-low fluctuation, while that of barley grown field was increased. In the two farmlands, soil organic matter and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen were all significantly decreased, and the rate of decrease were faster in soil depth of 0-10 cm than that in soil depth of 10-20 cm, but soil organic matter and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen in alfalfa grown field was in the following order: slightly salinized plot (S1)>non-saline plot (CK)>moderately salinized plot (S2)>severely salinized plot (S3)>very severely salinized plot (S4); for barley, it was in the following order: CK>S1>S2>S3>S4, and there had different significant difference between different salinized plots under the two farmlands; 2) In growing seasons, different salinization gradient plots had different soil depths of salt accumulation and appearing the peak of average soil ECP under the two crops farmlands. In the composition of soil soluble salt ions and ratio, the same salinized gradient plots between the two crops farmlands were similar; but in alfalfa grown field, the ratios of C1 and Na++K+ in CK and Si were significantly lower than that of CK and S1 in barley grown field, and the change ranges of different ions from CK to S4 were higher than that of barley; 3) In dry matter accumulation and distribution traits, at any given growth stage, along salinization gradient increased, plant total dry matter was more distributed to leaves and roots and center of accumulation and distribution of dry matter in the plant in different salinization gradients was gradually slowly than CK plant.

A large body of evidence suggests that gross photosynthesis (AG) of maize leaves can be accurately estimated from measurements of thylakoid electron transport rates (ETR) using chlorophyll fluorescence techniques. However, before this technique can be adopted, it will first be necessary to determine how the relationship between chlorophyll fluorescence and CO2 assimilation is affected by the non-steady state PPFD conditions which predominate in the field. Also, it must be determined if the relationship is stable across different maize genotypes, and across phenological stages. In the present work, the relationship between ETR and AG was examined in leaves of three maize hybrids by making simultaneous measurements of leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence, both under controlled environment conditions and in the field. Under steady-state conditions, a linear relationship between ETR and AG was observed, although a slight deviation from linearity was apparent at low AG. This deviation may arise from an error in the assumption that respiration in illuminated leaves is equivalent to respiration in darkened leaves. The relationship between chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic CO2 assimilation was not stable during fluctuations in incident PPFD. Since even minor (e.g. 20%) fluctuations in incident PPFD can produce sustained( > 20 s) departures from the mean relationship between ETR and AG, chlorophyll fluorometry can only provide an accurate estimate of actual CO2 assimilation rates under relatively stable PPFD conditions. In the field, the mean value of ETR / AG during the early part of the season (4.70 +/- 0.07) was very similar to that observed in indoor-grown plants in the vegetative stage (4.60 +/- 0.09); however, ETR / AG increased significantly over the growing season, reaching 5.00 +/- 0.09 by the late grain-filling stage. Differences in ETR / AG among the three genotypes examined were small (less than 1% of the mean) and not statistically significant, suggesting that chlorophyll fluorometry can be used as the basis of a fair comparison of leaf photosynthetic rates among different maize cultivars.","Univ Georgia, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; Univ Guelph, Dept Crop Sci, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; University of Guelph","Earl, HJ (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Miller Plant Sci Bldg, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","","Earl, Hugh/F-5683-2012","","","","",NA,"29","34","36","1","13","KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL","DORDRECHT","SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0166-8595","","","PHOTOSYNTH RES","Photosynth.

Progress requires determining which processes and species differences are most important for coexistence when multiple processes operate and species differ in many ways. Modern coexistence theory (MCT), formalised by Chesson, holds out the promise of doing that, but empirical applications remain scarce. We argue that MCT's mathematical complexity and subtlety have obscured the simplicity and power of its underlying ideas and hindered applications. We present a general computational approach that extends our previous solution for the storage effect to all of standard MCT's spatial and temporal coexistence mechanisms, and also process-defined mechanisms amenable to direct study such as resource partitioning, indirect competition, and life history trade-offs. The main components are a method to partition population growth rates into contributions from different mechanisms and their interactions, and numerical calculations in which some mechanisms are removed and others retained. We illustrate how our approach handles features that have not been analysed in the standard framework through several case studies: competing diatom species under fluctuating temperature, plant-soil feedbacks in grasslands, facilitation in a beach grass community, and niche differences with independent effects on recruitment, survival and growth in sagebrush steppe.","[Ellner, Stephen P.] Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Snyder, Robin E.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Biol, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Adler, Peter B.] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildand Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Adler, Peter B.] Utah State Univ, Ctr Ecol, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Hooker, Giles] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol Stat & Computat Biol, Ithaca, NY USA","Cornell University; Case Western Reserve University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Cornell University","Ellner, SP (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.","spe2@cornell.edu","","","US NSF [DEB 1353039, DEB 1354041, DEB 1353078]","US NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","We thank our pre-submission and anonymous reviewers for comments and insightful questions that led to new analyses, substantial restructuring and a more user-friendly paper.

This paper presents a novel method for modeling an environment of mushrooms growth to comparing the performance of two controlling methods (fuzzy logic and digital (ON/OFF) control) for controlling mentioned parameters on production rate. The Controllers and other equipment were developed to data collection and analysis of these parameters was performed by using Simulink part of MATLAB software. Precise control of the parameters involved in the growth of mushrooms caused to improve product quality and reduced energy consumption. The results of tests and mean value obtained on two different methods showed that the fuzzy controlling with having least standard deviation, variance and error, is better than digital controlling. Fuzzy controlling system had the lowest fluctuation and lowest band pass. According to gradient of graph, maximum and minimum of results, can conclude that the fuzzy controlling has shown better response in controlling the process. Based on the number of actuators mode changing on both systems, it can be understood that in digital control system, downtime, and depreciation and energy consumption would be higher than the fuzzy control system.

However, masquerade has received little attention from biologists and is often misinterpreted as mimicry by the public and even by scientists, as a consequence of the lack of systematic biological information for masqueraders. Therefore, using the orchid mantis Hymenopus coronatus (Insecta: Mantodea), a classic masquerader, as the study species, we asked: (1) what is the population abundance and life cycle? (2) whether it closely coexists with specific plant or not? (3) how its colour morph changes across life stages? and (4) whether and how the key environmental factors affect its life cycle? Results suggested that the orchid mantis (1) had an extremely low wild population abundance; (2) did not coexist with specific plant; (3) exhibited colour morph diversity; (4) might match its reproductive and nymph developmental period with local seasonal fluctuations of temperature and precipitation. We then compared its life history differences between the two sexes. The results indicated that the two sexes can be remarkably different in development duration, growth rate, lifespan and body weight. This study is the first systematic investigation of the orchid mantis; the results provide useful natural history data for ecologists and evolutionary biologists to understand the adaptive strategies of elusive appearance of masqueraders.","[Zhao, Xin; Liu, Jing-Xin; Chen, Zhanqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Chen, ZQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Yunnan, Peoples R China.","chenzhanqi@xtbg.ac.cn","","","","","",NA,"44","0","0","0","0","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0269-7653","1573-8477","","EVOL ECOL","Evol.

This insect-fungal disease complex is continuing its expansion and reaching new areas such as the state of Michigan. As it does so, it has serious implications for the health of both individual trees and beech-containing ecosystems as whole. Numerous tree characteristics affect abundance of beech scale on individual trees, including tree age, diameter, area and texture of bark, bark chemical composition, other bark-dwelling organisms, tree genetics, side of tree bole examined, and crown health variables. Beech scale colonization is generally greater in favorable microsites. These microsites include such characteristics as large areas of rough bark, higher levels of bark nitrogen, favorable associations with bark-dwelling organisms, more shade, and low temperature fluctuations. The development of beech bark disease through its three stages of progression once beech scale is on trees in an area is affected by a number of factors such as tree age, size, vigor, and stress levels from other factors. Spread of beech bark disease through ecosystems is likely most strongly controlled by the spatial patterns of beech stands and beech trees within stands, although other agents such as wind and animals can play important roles as well. Research to date in Michigan supports the importance of contiguous forest stands in increasing the rate of beech bark disease spread. Beech bark disease has a wide array of effects on tree health, including notably greater levels of damage, poorer tree crown conditions, and reduced radial wood growth. Negative effects can occur even when the amount of beech scale present on the tree is relatively small. Further research directions are suggested.","Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Witter, JA (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nat Resources & Environm, Dana Bldg,430 E Univ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"35","2","2","5","36","USDA FOREST SERVICE","NEWTOWN SQUARE","11 CAMPUS BLVD, STE 200, NEWTOWN SQUARE, PA 19073-3294 USA","","","","USDA FS NE RES ST GT","","","2005","133","","",NA,"",NA,"28","35","","","","","","8","Plant Sciences; Forestry","Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)","Plant Sciences; Forestry","BDU95",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000235519100004","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy] putting greens for growth suppression and secondary benefits. Improperly timed reapplications will reduce the benefits of TE, but knowing when to reapply is difficult because suppression duration is affected by environmental conditions, especially temperature. In another experiment we determined that GDD with a base temperature of 0 degrees C (GDD(0)) was the most precise unit for predicting the maximum suppression point (MSP) after a TE application on a 'MiniVerde' ultradwarf bermudagrass putting green. The model suggested that the MSP occurred at 262 GDD(0) after the TE application. The objective of this second experiment was to test GDD(0) reapplication intervals for an extended period of time. We included four GDD(0) intervals (100, 200, 400, and 600) and two TE rates (0.022 and 0.044 kg a.i. ha(-1)). We hypothesized that reapplying TE before the MSP would result in a consistent suppression magnitude from day to day (i.e., consistent daily growth), which should be an ideal growth pattern for turfgrass managers. The 100- and 200-GDD(0) intervals yielded consistent suppression magnitude throughout the experiment, and suppression magnitude increased with the higher TE rate. In contrast, the 400- and 600-GDD(0) intervals allowed fluctuation in suppression magnitude from day to day. Discoloration occurred after initial applications and was more severe for the higher TE rate.","[Brown, Austin M.; Harris, James R.; McElroy, J.

However, because most of the human evolutionary history has been shaped by hunter-gatherer lifestyle relying on diverse plant and animal food sources, it is also important to understand how climate affected the population dynamics of hunter-gatherers. We thus studied whether climate, measured as a reconstructed annual mean temperature, had concurrent or delayed effects on the key components of population dynamics, annual births and deaths, in three historical (1722-1850) Sami populations of Northern Finland that depended mainly on fishing, hunting, and reindeer herding for their livelihood. We found only weak concurrent effects of mean temperature on annual births and deaths, although in general warm years correlated with increased birth and reduced mortality rates. Likewise, temperature-mediated delayed effects were mainly absent: in one population only, a warm previous year tended to reduce the number of births. By contrast, annual numbers of births and deaths were more closely associated, as indicated by negative correlations between births and deaths up to three previous years. To summarize, in contrast to historical agrarian societies, the population dynamics of historical Sami seemed to be only weakly associated with annual mean temperature, which may indicate that these populations, probably due to their dietary breadth, were rather unaffected by climatic variation.","Univ Turku, Dept Biol, FI-20014 Turku, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Geol, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland","University of Turku; University of Helsinki","Helle, S (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Dept Biol, Yliopistonmaki 1, FI-20014 Turku, Finland.","sayrhe@utu.fi","","","","","",NA,"53","15","15","0","20","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1042-0533","1520-6300","","AM J HUM BIOL","Am.

Since global warming is projected to progress with annual fluctuations, weather-adaptive cultivation techniques are needed in the area of barley production. This study aimed to determine the effect of nitrogen (N) application rate at heading on the grain yield of barley grown under different weather conditions based on two years of field experiments. Grain yield increased markedly with increasing N application rate in the 2017-2018 cropping season but not in the 2016-2017 cropping season. In contrast, late-emerging tillers clearly increased with increasing N application rate in the 2016-2017 cropping season but not in the 2017-2018 cropping season. Plants grown in the 2016-2017 cropping season produced relatively few grains due to the short period of tillering as a results of high air temperatures compared with those grown in the 2017-2018 crop season. Thus, in the 2016-2017 cropping season, N application could be used for the production of late-emerging tillers as a consequence of the limited sink capacity, whereas, in the 2017-2018 cropping season, it could be used effectively to increase grain yield.","[Tanaka, Ryo; Nakano, Hiroshi] NARO, Kyushu Okinawa Agr Res Ctr, 496 Izumi, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8330041, Japan","National Agriculture & Food Research Organization - Japan","Nakano, H (corresponding author), NARO, Kyushu Okinawa Agr Res Ctr, 496 Izumi, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8330041, Japan.","nakanohr@affrc.go.jp","","","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan(Ministry of Agriculture Forestry & Fisheries - Japan)","Financial support in part from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan, project 'Development of mitigation and adaptation technologies to climate change in the sectors of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries' is greatly appreciated.

These fluctuations are different in each climatic region. Net primary production (NPP) indicating the plant growth and carbon stabilization over period of time is influenced by these fluctuations. Investigation of the variations in the NPP and analysis of its relationship with the climatic and environmental variables can play a key role in determining the effects of fluctuations of climatic variables on the NPP. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in the NPP and its correlation with precipitation rate and temperature during 2000-2014 based on the annual NPP estimates determined by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and precipitation and temperature data of the synoptic stations in eight climate regions in Iran. The slope of variations in the NPP was calculated in these climatic regions, and then, the changes in the NPP trend at two confidence levels of 95 and 99% were investigated based on the pixel-based method using the Mann-Kendall test. The sensitivity of NPP to climatic variables of temperature and precipitation was also estimated by calculating the correlation. The results showed the significant spatial distribution of NPP in the whole region under study indicating a declining trend from north to south and from west to east directions. The results also indicated the nonlinear variations in the temporal distribution of NPP. The annual mean NPP was found to follow the climatic boundaries in the climatic regions except for climate region 2, and region with the higher annual mean precipitation had higher annual mean NPP. Analysis of the trend by the Mann-Kendall method revealed that 3.2% of the pixels in the whole region followed a certain trend. Among the pixels, 70% of them followed a negative trend and the remaining 30% followed a positive trend. The greatest number of pixels with a certain trend was found in the Gulf of Oman coast climate region so that 93% of the pixels had a positive trend. The lowest number of pixels with a certain trend was observed in eastern Alborz foothills so that 87% of the pixels showed a negative trend. Slope variations of the NPP in the whole region varied from - 35 to 46 gC m(2)year(-1). The eastern plateau had the highest negative slope variations among the climate regions, and the highest positive slope variation of 42% was observed in the highlands climate region. In general, the precipitation rate and temperature showed a mean partial coefficient of 0.22 and 0.02, respectively, and the correlation between the NPP and temperature and precipitation was different in each climatic region. The temperature was negatively correlated with the NPP in four climatic regions with higher annual mean temperatures and in other climatic regions; it had a weak positive correlation. Therefore, the sensitivity of NPP to precipitation and temperature was different in each climatic region.","[Kamali, Alireza; Khosravi, Mahmood; Hamidianpour, Mohsen] Univ Sistan & Baluchestan, Dept Phys Geog, POB 987-98135, Zahedan, Iran","University of Sistan & Baluchestan","Khosravi, M (corresponding author), Univ Sistan & Baluchestan, Dept Phys Geog, POB 987-98135, Zahedan, Iran.","Khosravi@Gep.usb.ac.ir","kamali, alireza/H-1752-2017; Khosravi, Mahmood/AAD-2638-2022; Hamidianpour, Mohsen/ABG-4036-2021","Khosravi, Mahmood/0000-0002-2571-470X; Hamidianpour, Mohsen/0000-0001-7389-172X","University of Sistan and Baluchestan [1397] Funding Source: Medline","University of Sistan and Baluchestan","",NA,"55","8","10","3","30","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0167-6369","1573-2959","","ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS","Environ.

We monitored CO2 levels in soil gas and as bicarbonate in drainage from an experimental red pine ecosystem, for 1 year before and 3 years after its aboveground biomass was removed. Lack of physical disturbance, strict prevention of plant regrowth, and a comparison ecosystem without rooted plants facilitated isolation of the microclimatic and biochemical effects of instantaneous canopy removal and cessation of photosynthesis. Preharvest gas-phase CO2 levels fluctuated with growing-season soil temperature but reached their greatest levels (up to 10,000 ppmV) during late winter beneath snow and ice cover. This pattern, and the annual CO2 efflux of similar to 500 g C m(-2) yr(-1), continued for 2 years following harvest; the efflux declined by half in the third year. The surprising continuity of preharvest and postharvest rates of soil CO2 production reflects the replacement of root respiration with microbial respiration of root and litter substrates of declining lability, but boosted by soil temperature increases. Mass balance is consistent with a bulk root+litter exponential decay time (-1/k) of 4-6 years, such that most of the subsurface biomass accumulated over 15 years of tree growth would be lost in a decade after the harvest. The preharvest bicarbonate C efflux, which was less than 0.1% of the gas-phase efflux, trebled after the harvest owing to elimination of evapotranspiration and consequent increases in drainage while soil CO2 levels remained high. A large fraction of this hydrospheric'' sink for atmospheric CO2 is attributed to weathering under high soil CO2 levels before spring snowmelt and soil-water flushing. These observations suggest that disturbance may enhance long-term chemical-weathering CO2 sinks.","Washington State Univ, Dept Geol, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Allegheny Coll, Dept Geol, Meadville, PA 16335 USA; Washington State Univ, USDA, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Sanborn Head & Associates Inc, Concord, NH 03301 USA","Washington State University; Allegheny College; United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Washington State University","Keller, CK (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Geol, POB 642812, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.","ckkeller@wsu.edu; webb_ty@yahoo.com; robrien@allegheny.edu; jlsmith@wsu.edu","Keller, C/B-3205-2012","","","","",NA,"50","8","8","2","16","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","WASHINGTON","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","2169-8953","2169-8961","","J GEOPHYS RES-BIOGEO","J.

Laboratory investigations on life history parameters showed that the two species have different temperature tolerances and preferences. M. brachiata showed its highest reproductive success at 25 and 30-degrees-C but died at temperatures < 15-degrees-C and greater-than-or-equal-to 35-degrees-C. D. obtusa experienced a broader temperature range (2 to 25-degrees-C) but could not withstand temperatures greater-than-or-equal-to 30-degrees-C. Short term starvation periods (3d) caused the death of M. brachiata females, while D. obtusa soon recovered and reproduced when being refed. M. brachiata is a typical r-species with early reproduction, rapid development, high population growth rates and a high tendency to produce resting eggs; D. obtusa pursues more the concept of k-selection.","","","MAIER, G (corresponding author), UNIV ULM,BIOL 3 ABT,ALBERT EINSTEIN ALLEE 11,W-7900 ULM,GERMANY.","","","","","","",NA,"29","10","10","0","5","AKADEMIE VERLAG GMBH","BERLIN","MUHLENSTRASSE 33-34, D-13187 BERLIN, GERMANY","0020-9309","","","INT REV GES HYDROBIO","Int.

Subsurface flow wetlands or artificial wetlands filters (AWF) are being installed at many facilities throughout the U.S. Most of these systems are relatively new and extensive operational experience is lacking. This study presents an examination of the performance of a system at the U. S. Public Health Service's Gillis W. Long Hensen's Disease Control Center located in Carville, Louisiana. The AWF is designed to meet effluent standards of 10 mg/L 5-day BOD (BOD5) and 15 mg/L TSS. based on a design flow of 568 m3/d (150 000 gpd) with a 24-hour detention time. The AWF has a 0.69-m depth of 2-8 cm rock with a 15-cm pea gravel cap and swamp potato (Sagittaria latifola) and duck potato (Sagittaria falcata) planted on 30-cm centers. The study was initiated in the spring of 1988 and samples were collected twice a week from seven sampling stations and analyzed for BOD5, flow rates, temperature, pH, TSS, and VSS. The results indicated that the AWF was effective at controlling BOD5 and TSS within design standards over a range of hydraulic fluctuations of 163-871 m3/d (43 200-230 000 gpd). The AWF removed 62 and 76.5% of the influent BOD5 and TSS, respectively. Analysis of samples taken from sample wells located in the first one-third of the filter indicated 40 and 60% removal of BOD5 and TSS, respectively. Step flow introduction of wastewater could better optimize filter bed volumes and maintain uniform plant growth. For new AWF systems designs, greater length to width ratios could achieve the same treatment while minimizing front end clogging and ponding problems.","US PHS,GILLIS W LONG HANSENS DIS CONTROL CTR,CARVILLE,LA","United States Public Health Service","ZACHRITZ, WH (corresponding author), NEW MEXICO STATE UNIV,SW TECHNOL DEV INST,LAS CRUCES,NM 88003, USA.","","","","","","",NA,"23","16","23","1","6","WATER ENVIRONMENT FEDERATION","ALEXANDRIA","601 WYTHE ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1994","1061-4303","","","WATER ENVIRON RES","Water Environ.

The use of municipal wastewater to cultivate lipid-producing microalgae for the production of biodiesel not only reduces the production cost of biodiesel and alleviates energy shortage, but also mitigates eutrophication and protects the water environment. This study explored the effects of light, pH, and nutrients on the growth and lipid production of Scenedesmus obliquus, as well as the lipid production and pollutant removal capabilities of algae during microalgae cultivation in municipal wastewater at different treatment stages. The optimal conditions for the growth and lipid production of S. obliquus were determined as light intensity of 14,500 lx, total nitrogen (TN) content of 97 mg L-1, total phosphorus (TP) content of 11 mg L-1, and CO2 content of 9.8%. Under these optimal conditions, the lipid yield from microalgae was 0.367 g L-1, which was superior to other optimisation results in the literature. The total lipid yields of S. obliquus cultivated in the wastewater from the primary and secondary settling tanks were 0.38 g L-1 and 0.33 g L-1, respectively. The TN and TP removal rates were 99.8% and 83.1% from the wastewater of the primary settling tank, and 98.9% and 97.6% from the wastewater of the secondary settling tank, respectively. In addition, fluctuations in the quality of raw wastewater may lead to fluctuations in the final lipid yield, and a regulating tank should be used when necessary. In short, these results indicate the feasibility of cultivating lipid-producing microalgae in municipal wastewater for the production of biodiesel. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Growth experiments indicated P. playfairii be a slow-growing [0.09 divisions (div.) d(-1)], truly freshwater species that will only L,row in salinities of 0-5 practical salinity units (psu). In contrast, P. foveolato tolerated salinities of 0-30 psu and exhibited a significantly faster growth rate (0.47 div. d(-1)). Both P. playfairii and P. foveolata grew under a wide temperature ran,,e (10-30 degreesC and 10-25 degreesC, respectively), indicating a tolerance to temperature fluctuations typical of shallow, enclosed water bodies. Both species were negative for toxins such as those from marine species of Prorocentrum causing diarrhetic shellfish poisoning in humans. Molecular sequencing of the large-subunit ribosomal DNA suggested that P. playfairii and P. foveolata are more closely related to toxic benthic marine Prorocentrum (such as P. lima and P. cf. belizeanum), than pelagic marine Prorocentrum (such as P. gracile, P. rhathymum, P. triestinum and P. compressum).

Although the C and N cycles in soil are usually considered to be closely linked, few data exist where both C and N pools and gross N fluxes have been measured seasonally. Here we present measurements of inorganic N, extracted soluble organic N, microbial biomass C and N, gross N fluxes and CO2 production from soil collected under wheat in a ley-arable and continuous arable rotation within a long-term experiment. The amounts of inorganic N and extracted soluble organic N were similar (range 5-35 kg N ha(-1); 0-23 cm) but had different seasonal patterns: whilst inorganic N declined during wheat growth, extracted soluble organic N peaked after cultivation and also during maximal stem elongation. The microbial biomass was significantly larger in the ley-arable (964 kg C ha(-1); 0-23 cm) than the continuous arable rotation (518 kg C ha(-1); 0-23 cm) but with no clear seasonal pattern. In contrast, CO2 produced from soil and gross N mineralization showed strong seasonality linked to soil temperature and moisture content. Normalization of soil CO2 production and gross N mineralization with respect to these environmental regulators enabled us to study the underlying influence of the incorporation of fresh plant material into soil on these processes. The average normalized gross rates of N mineralized during the growing season were 1.74 and 2.55 kg N ha(-1) nday(-1) in continuous arable and ley-arable rotations respectively. Production rates (gross N mineralization, gross nitrification) were similar in both land uses and matched rates of NH4+ and NO3- consumption, resulting in periods of net N mineralization and immobilization. There was no simple relationship between soil CO2 production and gross N mineralization, which we attributed to changes in the C : N ratio of the mineralizing pool(s).","Rothamsted Res, Dept Soil Sci, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England","UK Research & Innovation (UKRI); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Rothamsted Research","Murphy, DV (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth & Geog Sci, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Soil Biol Grp, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.","daniel.murphy@uwa.edu.au","Goulding, Keith WT/B-2635-2012; Stockdale, Elizabeth/A-8141-2013","Goulding, Keith WT/0000-0002-6465-1465; Murphy, Daniel/0000-0002-4686-9276; Stockdale, Elizabeth/0000-0003-4834-8594","","","",NA,"46","44","46","4","56","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING","OXFORD","9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND","1351-0754","","","EUR J SOIL SCI","Eur.

K.). In the experiment, drought was increased during the growing season by excluding precipitation, and night warming was created by reducing heat loss. To assess physiological stress, leaf size and leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA) as integrative measures of stress during leaf development and leaf gas exchange as a classical instantaneous method to detect physiological stress, were measured. Since leaf FA increased with increasing size, comparisons of asymmetries were made for relative rather than absolute asymmetry. Relative leaf FA was calculated as the absolute difference between leaf size (area or width) of left and right halves, corrected for trait size. Drought treatment increased the relative leaf area FA in 2000 and not in 1999, in agreement with a stronger treatment in 2000. Conversely, the warming treatment decreased the relative leaf area FA in 1999 and not in 2000, coinciding with the lower minimum temperatures in the growing season of 1999. Differences in water availability and temperature between years were related with changes in the relative leaf area FA, which were consistent with the treatment effects. In contrast, leaf gas exchange rates and leaf size showed no significant response to the environmental manipulations, although there was a slight decrease of photosynthetic values and leaf size in drought treatments in both years. Leaf FA therefore appeared to be a more sensitive indicator of physiological stress than leaf size or gas exchange measurements. Our results indicate that a future increase in the severity of drought during the growing season will increase physiological stress of V. myrtillus, whereas warming will decrease physiological stress during leaf development because of the alleviation of temperature constraints.","Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Edifici C, CREAF, Unitat Ecofisiol,CSIC,CEAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Bangor LL57 2UP, Gwynedd, Wales","Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes (CEAB); UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH)","Llorens, L (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Edifici C, CREAF, Unitat Ecofisiol,CSIC,CEAB, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.","laura@creaf.uab.es","Llorens, Laura/L-8732-2014; Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Emmett, Bridget A/D-6199-2011; Llorens, Laura/ABH-2383-2020","Llorens, Laura/0000-0001-9190-5144; Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Emmett, Bridget A/0000-0002-2713-4389; Llorens, Laura/0000-0001-9190-5144","","","",NA,"55","23","26","3","21","UNIV CHICAGO PRESS","CHICAGO","1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","1058-5893","1537-5315","","INT J PLANT SCI","Int.

Water level treatments may affect its overwintering and regrowth capability during warming winter. To test this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of different water levels on the survival rates and regrowth of E. crassipes under experimental warm winter conditions. Three water levels were set up including drawdown with rooted, shallow submergence with rooted and floating. Regrowth characters including number of ramets, Fv/Fm, biomass and biomass allocation were surveyed. The results showed that warming significantly increased survival, ramet numbers and the biomass of plants. Warming also significantly increased Fv/Fm in drawdown plants. Water level only impacted plants under warming conditions. Compared to floating plants, drawdown significantly decreased survival but increased total biomass, while submergence led to 100 % survival, significantly higher ramet numbers and increased total biomass. In terms of biomass allocation, the effects of warming were similar for drawdown and submergence cases; it resulted in increased shoot biomass allocation and a lower root mass ratio. Warming only significantly increased the stem mass ratio of floating plants. Our findings suggested that warming help E. crassipes successfully overwinter and regrow during the next growing season. Drawdown or shallow submergence cannot effectively control this species but rather promotes its regrowth during warm winters. Thus, this species has the potential to spread with warm winters and frequent water level fluctuations caused by future climate change.","[Liu, Junchu; Chen, Xiuwen; Wang, Yalin; Li, Xi; Yu, Dan; Liu, Chunhua] Wuhan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Natl Field Stn Lake Ecosyst Liangzi Lake, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China","Wuhan University","Liu, CH (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Coll Life Sci, Natl Field Stn Lake Ecosyst Liangzi Lake, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.","liuchh@163.com","","","Natural Science Foundation of China [31170339]; Special Foundation of National Science and Technology Basic Research [2013FY112300]","Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Foundation of National Science and Technology Basic Research","The authors gratefully acknowledge that Shufeng Fan and Tian Lv provided useful suggestions and data collection for the manuscript and funding support came from the Natural Science Foundation of China (31170339), and the Special Foundation of National Science and Technology Basic Research (2013FY112300).",NA,"50","8","10","3","35","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1386-2588","1573-5125","","AQUAT ECOL","Aquat.

Food security throughout the country is constantly threatened due to inter/intra annual fluctuations on crop production. Climate resilient and highly nutritional crops (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) are of increasing interest in regions exposed to environmental stresses and having high undernourishment rates. This study examines quinoa's adaptability in two agro-ecological zones of Burkina Faso (Soudano-Sahelian and Soudanian zones). Four quinoa genotypes (Pasankalla, Negra Collana, Titicaca and Puno) are tested for different sowing periods (from October to January) in two agro-ecological zones, and their effect on crop growth is evaluated. Results show a significant effect of sowing dates on plant phenology in both agro-climatic zones. Photoperiod, temperature and wind speed are the major environmental factors explaining variation in terms of crop growth and development between sowing dates. Emerging findings show that short cycle varieties (Titicaca and Puno) can be highly performing (above 3 t ha(-1)) when sowing between November-December and October-December in the Soudano-Sahelian and Soudanian zones, respectively. Other genotypes (Pasankalla), can respond better to strong Harmattan winds, besides having similar yields to those reported for Titicaca and Puno. Pasankalla and Negra Collana tend to be susceptible to heat-stress conditions occurring in March-April because of their long cycle (around 120 days).","[Dao, Abdalla; Sanou, Jacob] Inst Environm & Rech Agr INERA, Bobo Dioulasso 910, Burkina Faso; [Guira, Amidou; Gnanda, Abdou; Nebie, Louis] Univ Nazi Boni, Inst Dev Rural IDR, Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso; [Alvar-Beltran, Jorge] Univ Florence, Dept Agr Food Environm & Forestry DAGRI, I-50144 Florence, Italy","University of Florence","Dao, A (corresponding author), Inst Environm & Rech Agr INERA, Bobo Dioulasso 910, Burkina Faso.","adao@wacci.ug.edu.gh; guira.amidou@yahoo.fr; jorge.alvar@unifi.it; gnandaabdou@gmail.com; nebielouis@yahoo.fr; jacobsanou17@gmail.com","","Alvar, Jorge/0000-0003-2454-0629","Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [TCP/SFW/3404, TCP/RAF/3602]","Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)","To the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for the seed and fund provision for carrying out this experiment under the technical cooperation programs TCP/SFW/3404 and TCP/RAF/3602.",NA,"30","2","2","0","2","FIRENZE UNIV PRESS","FIRENZE","JOURNALS DIVISION, BORGO ALBIZI, 28, FIRENZE, 50122, ITALY","2038-5625","","","ITAL J AGROMETEOROL","Ital.

Climatic conditions affecting both radiation and water use are mainly determined by the planting dates. Elucidating the relationship between the radiation and the water use with climate variables is important for the quantification of crop productivity and for improving water use efficiency (WUE) and radiation use efficiency (RUE). The influence of seasonal fluctuations (spring-summer and summer-fall) resulting from two planting dates (28 March and 6 September) on growth, radiation and water use efficiencies was investigated in zucchini plants cultivated hydroponically in a unheated greenhouse located at Viterbo, central Italy. Plants grown in the spring-summer season exhibited a higher maximum value of total, leaf, stem, fruit dry matter and leaf area index (971, 460, 91, 422 g m(-2) and 5.1, respectively) than those grown during the summer-fall season (672, 306,58,311 g m(-2) and 2.7, respectively). The marketable fresh yield in the spring-summer was higher than the summer-fall (6.2 versus 4.7 kg m(-2)). The canopy extinction coefficient was empirically determined as 0.72 for the light interception. The crop coefficient (K-c) during the spring-summer period ranged from 0.10 to 1.15, while for the summer-fall season the K, ranged from 0.12 to 0.80. Before harvest initiation, the transpiration rates, RUE and water use efficiency calculated on above dry weight basis (WUEb) were similar between growing seasons (average 0.51 L m(-2) day(-1), 2.07 g MJ(-1) and 2.92 g kg(-1), respectively), while after harvest initiation, summer-fall season showed a lower transpiration rate (0.97 versus 2.60 L m(-2) day(-1)) and a higher RUE (4.17 versus 2.46 g MJ(-1)) and WUEb (4.02 versus 2.73 g kg(-1)) in comparison to the spring-summer season. Water use efficiency on fresh fruit yield basis (WUEy) was also higher in summer-fall season compared to spring-summer season (50.5 versus 31.5 g kg(-1)). The variability in RUE and WUEb was associated with, daily mean solar radiation (R-s) daily mean air temperature (T-a) and daily mean vapour pressure deficit (VPD). In both growing phases, negative exponential relationships were evident by plotting the RUE, and WUEb against climatic variables (R-s, T-a and VPD). R-s, T-a and VPD were greatly higher in the spring-summer season, which influences RUE and WUEb negatively. These results may be applied in greenhouse climate control and management decisions. In our case the use of light selective and movable screen may improve substantially water use efficiency of warm season crops in Mediterranean areas, where water supplies are limited.

The study, is based on the incorporation of field data and experimental measurements. Grazing, respiration and production rates of Diaphanosoma spp.., Ceriodaphnia spp. and Bosmina spp. were experimentally measured at three temperatures, and the results were extrapolated to the field biomass distibution at these respective temperatures, and the total lake capacity was calculated using the following equation: consumption = respiration + production + excretion. The field capacity of consumption, respiration and production were found to be most correlated with biomass density, but the temporal fluctuation of the percent of excretion from consumed energy differed. The increase in P, decline in N and decrease in the TN/TP mass ratio in the epilimnion of Lake Knneret during 1969-2004 created N limitation. An increase in C and decline in TN, with a consequential increase in the C/TN ratio were documented. TP was augmented but the C/TP ratio was only slightly increased. During 1975-2004, P was probably, a minor limitation for cladoceran growth. The positive impact of recycled P by cladocerans under the N limitation in Lake Knneret is discussed. There is a current threat on the water quality, derived from N limitation (mostly in summer-fall) and consequent Cyanophyta blooms. Thus, the role of recycled P by grazers may be significant.","Galilee Technol Ctr, IL-11016 Kiryat Shmone, Israel","","Migal, MG (corresponding author), Galilee Technol Ctr, POB 831, IL-11016 Kiryat Shmone, Israel.","gophen@migal.org.il","","","","","",NA,"21","2","2","1","7","TRIVENI ENTERPRISES","LUCKNOW","C/O KIRAN DALELA, 1/206 VIKAS NAGAR, KURSI RD, LUCKNOW 226 022, INDIA","0254-8704","","","J ENVIRON BIOL","J.Environ.Biol.","JUL","2011","32","4","",NA,"",NA,"455","462","","","","","","8","Environmental Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","783GK","22315824","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000292069300008","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, water resource in Shenyang city, Liaoning Province is much short-handed, soil moisture cannot satisfy the water requirements of P. mongolica growth under local natural conditions, more and more trees are being planted which needed to be irrigated, thus studying the transpiration characteristics of such tree species and its relationship with the meteorological factors and growth parameters is very important to the survival of trees in this region. On this background we took a research on the transpiration of indigenous P. mongolica tree species, while simultaneously monitoring the atmospheric and soil moisture contents. In this study, the sap flow rate (J(s)) of selected three 5a of P. mongolica tree samples were measured during 11th May to 15th October in 2019 by using the stem heat balance technique. Finally, we got results as follows: In the whole growing season, P. mongolica consumed water of 953.5 L (average value). Diurnal variation of J(s) fluctuation was transitionally changing in the growing season, adjusting to its way of water consumption. J(s) of P. mongolica tree species varied greatly under different weather, J(s) in rainy days were rather slow both in day and night, which reflect that the dynamic of water absorption diverse in the three trees. The vertical distribution of soil moisture content was observed throughout the whole growing season. In the 0.3-0.4 m soil layer contributed to most of the plant transpiration as the highest coefficient of determination at this layer. The variation in J(s) of P. mongolica could be described by a multiple linear regression against the meteorological variables. The Kendall's tau analysis indicated air temperature (T-a), solar radiation (R-n), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) had great influence on sap flow of P. mongolica. To sum up, in the studied district afforestation was limited to T-a, R-n, VPD and top soil moisture factors.","[Li, Jinghao; Song, Yixuan; Ma, Yan] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Gen Stn Forest & Grassland Pest Management, Shenyang 111300, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Li, Jinghao; Song, Yixuan] Dengta Urban & Rural Ecol Greening & Riverbank En, Liaoyang 110034, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Bao, Yanfeng] Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Desertificat Studies, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xinwei] Liaoning Forestry Dev Serv Ctr, Shenyang 110036, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Xie, Cunyi] Microbial Res Inst Liaoning Prov, Chaoyang 122000, Liaoning, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Forestry; Institute of Desertification Studies, CAF","Bao, YF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Forestry, Inst Desertificat Studies, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.","baoyanfeng@caf.ac.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31600581, IDS2020JY-1]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China31600581, Funding Balance ProjeetIDS2020JY-1.",NA,"58","0","0","1","3","PARLAR SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS (P S P)","FREISING","ANGERSTR. 12, 85354 FREISING, GERMANY","1018-4619","1610-2304","","FRESEN ENVIRON BULL","Fresenius Environ.

A reduction in snow cover due to warmer atmospheric temperature in formerly cold ecosystems, however, could counteract an increase in soil temperature by reduction of insulation. Thus, soil freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) might increase in frequency and magnitude with warming, potentially leading to a disturbance of the soil biota and release of nutrients. Here, we assessed how soil freeze-thaw magnitude and frequency affect short-term release of nutrients in temperate deciduous forest soils by conducting a three-factorial gradient experiment with ex situ soil samples in climate chambers. The fully crossed experiment included soils from forests dominated by Fagus sylvatica (European beech) that originate from different winter climate (mean coldest month temperature range Delta T >4 K), a range of FTC magnitudes from no (T = 4.0 degrees C) to strong (T = -11.3 degrees C) soil frost, and a range of FTC frequencies (f = 0-7). We hypothesized that higher FTC magnitude and frequency will increase the release of nutrients. Furthermore, soils from cold climates with historically stable winter soil temperatures due to deep snow cover will be more responsive to FTCs than soils from warmer, more fluctuating winter soil climates. FTC magnitude and, to a lesser extent, also FTC frequency resulted in increased nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate release almost exclusively in soils from cold, snow-rich sites. The hierarchical regression analyses of our three-factorial gradient experiment revealed that the effects of climatic origin (mean minimum winter temperature) followed a sigmoidal curve for all studied nutrients and was modulated either by FTC magnitude (phosphate) or by FTC magnitude and frequency (nitrate, ammonium) in complex twofold and, for all studied nutrients, in threefold interactions of the environmental drivers. Compared to initial concentrations, soluble nutrients were predicted to increase to 250 % for nitrate (up to 16 mu g NO3-N kg(-1)DM), to 110 % for ammonium (up to 60 mu g NH4-N kg(-1)DM), and to 400 % for phosphate (2.2 mu g PO4-P kg(-1)DM) at the coldest site for the strongest magnitude and highest frequency. Soils from warmer sites showed little nutrient release and were largely unaffected by the FTC treatments except for above-average nitrate release at the warmest sites in response to extremely cold FTC magnitude. We suggest that currently warmer forest soils have historically already passed the point of high responsiveness to winter climate change, displaying some form of adaptation either in the soil biotic composition or in labile nutrient sources. Our data suggest that previously cold sites, which will lose their protective snow cover during climate change, are most vulnerable to increasing FTC frequency and magnitude, resulting in strong shifts in nitrogen and phosphorus release. In nutrient-poor European beech forests of the studied Pleistocene lowlands, nutrients released over winter may be leached out, inducing reduced plant growth rates in the following growing season.","[Kreyling, Juergen; Weigel, Robert] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Expt Plant Ecol, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Schumann, Rhena] Univ Rostock, Biol Stn Zingst, Appl Ecol & Phycol, Muhlenstr 27, D-18374 Zingst, Germany; [Weigel, Robert] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany","Ernst Moritz Arndt Universitat Greifswald; University of Rostock; University of Gottingen","Kreyling, J (corresponding author), Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Expt Plant Ecol, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.","juergen.kreyling@uni-greifswald.de","Weigel, Robert/U-1954-2019","Weigel, Robert/0000-0001-9685-6783; Kreyling, Juergen/0000-0001-8489-7289; Schumann, Rhena/0000-0002-0605-3379","DFG [KR 3309/9-1]; DFG (Research Training Group RESPONSE (RTG 2010))","DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)); DFG (Research Training Group RESPONSE (RTG 2010))(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This research has been supported by the DFG (grant nos.

In particular, the littoral zone may be a hotspot for production of greenhouse gases. We investigated the spatiotemporal variation of CO2 flux at the littoral zone of a Chinese reservoir along a wet-to-dry transect from permanently flooded land, seasonally flooded land to non-flooded dry land, using the static dark chamber technique. The mean total CO2 emission was 346 mg m(-2) h(-1) and the rate varied significantly by water levels, months and time of day. The spatiotemporal variation of flux was highly correlated with biomass, temperature and water level. Flooding could play a positive role in carbon balance if water recession occurs at the time when carbon gains associated with plant growth overcomes the carbon loss of ecosystem. The overall carbon balance was analysed using cumulative greenhouse gases fluxes and biomass, bringing the data of the present study alongside previously published, simultaneously measured CH4 and N2O fluxes. For the growing season, 12.8 g C m(-2) was absorbed by the littoral zone. Taking CH4 and N2O into the calculation showed that permanently flooded sites were a source of greenhouse gases, rather than a sink. Our study emphasises how water level fluctuation influenced CO2, CH4 andN(2)O in different ways, which greatly affected the spatiotemporal variation and emission rate of greenhouse gases from the littoral zone.","[Yang, Meng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Meng; Geng, Xuemeng; Guan, Lei; Zhang, Yamian; Lei, Jialin; Lu, Cai; Lei, Guangchun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Grace, John] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh EH9 3FF, Midlothian, Scotland; [Geng, Xuemeng] Beijing Shoufa Tianren Ecol Landscape Co Ltd, Beijing 102600, Peoples R China; [Guan, Lei] Tianjin Polytech Univ, Sch Humanities & Laws, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Beijing Forestry University; University of Edinburgh; Tiangong University","Lei, GC (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Nat Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.","yangmeng@igsnrr.ac.cn; jgrace@ed.ac.uk; xuemeng17@foxmail.com; gl4211@163.com; yamian183@163.com; leijialinbjfu@foxmail.com; lucai.wetland@foxmail.com; guangchun.lei@foxmail.com","Guangchun, Lei/ABC-8081-2021; Grace, John/N-9280-2013","","Special Foundation for Basic Scientific and Technological Research Program [2013FY111800]; State Forestry Administration of China [200804005]; Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research [Y6V60220YZ]; CAS China Scholarship Council","Special Foundation for Basic Scientific and Technological Research Program; State Forestry Administration of China; Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research(Chinese Academy of Sciences); CAS China Scholarship Council","This study was financially supported by: (1) Special Foundation for Basic Scientific and Technological Research Program under grant 2013FY111800; (2) State Forestry Administration of China under grant 200804005; (3) Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research under grant Y6V60220YZ; (4) CAS China Scholarship Council.

To determine the stability for agricultural utilization, the compost maturity was evaluated using physical, chemical, and biological parameters. Temperature of the inner compost heap remained high at over 50degreesC during the 80 d of composting, but the chemical and physical parameters apparently changed between 30 and 50 piling d: pH was a weakly acidic of the initial stage and neutral after 30 d of composting. The C / N ratio decreased to less than 12 after 65 d of composting, but the C / N ratio of the products was less than 0.5 time that of the initial value after 35 d of composting. Reducing sugar contents changed significantly between 40 and 45 d of composting, and the Y value that indicated color changes of the water extracts decreased and became stabilized at around 3 after 50 d of composting. Ring types and color on circular paper chromatograms showed an apparent difference before and after 40 d of composting. The content of sodium (Na), which might be one of the most harmful elements in Korean food wastes for agricultural utilization, increased from 12 to 17 g kg(-1) with time and Na mostly occurred in a water-soluble form. Acetic acid was the main component of volatile organic acids, and total organic acids were produced at a very high rate (500-700 mg kg(-1)) during the first 5-30 d of composting and then the rate decreased rapidly to below 300 mg kg(-1) after 35 d of composting. Germination index of Chinese cabbage in water extracts fluctuated with compost pile turning to a value below 50 by 40 d of composting, due to the effects of high contents of organic acids and Na. The value exceeded 50 after 45 d of composting but did not increase further with continuous composting, which might be due to the high content of Na.

The production rate and the N and P content in plant biomass were also analyzed. The mosaic soil and vegetation pattern had a significant influence on soil water quality. In the arable land, the mean annual concentration of total inorganic nitrogen (NH4-N + NO2-N + NO3-N) in piezometer water was 3-40 mg N l(-1), but in the riparian grey alder forest (Alnus incana) total inorganic nitrogen never exceeded 1 mg N l(-1). The most significant reduction was in the average concentration of NO3-N content, which was reduced from 25 mg l(-1) under the arable land to 0.5 mg l(-1) in both the alder forest and the sedge-dominated floodplain. The average P-tot concentration also decreased under the alder stands, being 0.2-1.5 mg P l(-1) in the arable land and less than 0.2 mg P l(-1) in the alder forest. Wetland herb communities (Carex elata association, Filipendula ulmaria, Cirsium oleraceum and Aegopodium podagraria dominated communities) also had a significant influence on soil water quality, increasing the internal cycling of N and P within the peatland. The plant biomass (the sum of above- and below-ground biomass) of riparian and wetland communities accumulates up to 54.3 g N m(-2) and up to 5.3 g P m(-2) during the growth season. The following factors have the highest priority in weather-induced changes in the nutrient fluxes in riparian peatlands: (a) the duration of frozen surface, (b) snowpack peak water, (c) the precipitation pattern over the warm period, (d) the duration and continuity of certain weather, (e) the occurrence of night frost events and soil freeze-thaw cycles. When night frost events start, the importance of autumn rainfalls is enhanced, as the high water-table intensifies the denitrification process but also increases Ca, Mg, K, N and P losses released during the frost-thaw cycle.","[Kull, Ain; Kull, Anne; Jaagus, Jaak; Mander, Uelo] Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Geog, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; [Kull, Anne; Kuusemets, Valdo] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Dept Agr & Environm Protect, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia","University of Tartu; Tartu University Institute of Ecology & Earth Sciences; Estonian University of Life Sciences","Kull, A (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Ecol & Earth Sci, Dept Geog, 46 Vanernuise St, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.","ain.kull@ut.ee","Mander, Ülo/H-3228-2015","Mander, Ülo/0000-0003-2340-6989; Kull, Ain/0000-0002-7534-3927","","","",NA,"77","12","12","0","29","FINNISH ENVIRONMENT INST","HELSINKI","P O BOX 140, FIN-00251 HELSINKI, FINLAND","1239-6095","1797-2469","","BOREAL ENVIRON RES","Boreal Environ.

We found under moderate conditions of temperature and photosynthetic flux density (PFD) (26 degrees C and 700 mu mol quanta m(-2)s(-1), similar to growth conditions) photosynthesis in the flag leaf of rice during heading and grain filling saturated at near ambient levels of CO2, with a concomitant loss of O-2 sensitivity, when a high stomatal conductance was maintained by high humidity (low vapor pressure deficit). Under 18 degrees C there was near complete loss of O-2 sensitivity of photosynthesis at normal ambient levels of CO2, This is in contrast to the large enhancement of photosynthesis by supra-atmospheric levels of CO2 and sub-atmospheric levels of O-2 by suppression of photorespiration when there is no limitation on utilizing the initial product of CO2 assimilation (triose-beta) as predicted from Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) kinetic properties. Thus, loss of sensitivity to CO2 and O-2 has been previously explained as a limitation on utilization of triose-beta to synthesize carbohydrates. Under high PFD at 25 degrees C, the rate of photosynthesis in rice declined over a period of hours around midday, while the intercellular levels of CO2 remained constant suggesting a limitation on utilization of photosynthate, Short-term fluctuations in climatic factors including temperature, light and humidity could result in a feedback limitation on photosynthesis in rice which may be exacerbated by rising CO2.","Washington State Univ, Inst Biol Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; Washington State Univ, Dept Bot, Pullman, WA 99164 USA","Washington State University; Washington State University","Winder, TL (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Inst Biol Chem, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.","","","Okita, Tom/0000-0002-2246-0599","","","",NA,"41","29","29","0","16","JAPANESE SOC PLANT PHYSIOLOGISTS","KYOTO","SHIMOTACHIURI OGAWA HIGASHI KAMIKYOKU, KYOTO, 602, JAPAN","0032-0781","","","PLANT CELL PHYSIOL","Plant Cell Physiol.","AUG","1998","39","8","",NA,"",NA,"813","820","","10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029439","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029439","","","8","Plant Sciences; Cell Biology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences; Cell Biology","112MV",NA,"Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000075499100003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Although it is widely accepted that a local Ca deficiency plays an important role in the induction of BER, there are also some claims that Ca deficiency is not the cause of BER as a critical level of Ca for BER induction has not been found.

Climate and the associated fire regime are never stable for long, and annual temperatures, atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen levels, and burn probability have varied radically over the last 350 million years. At the scale of thousands of years, floras have oscillated between spreading and retracting as climate and the dependent fire regime have fluctuated. At the scale of millions of years, distinct traits have evolved along three lines: fire resistance, fire-stimulated dormancy release, and rapid postfire growth, all limited by the type of fire (as controlled by climate) and postfire weather. Eight pairings of fire- and postfire-related traits resulting from the interplay between fire and climate are noted here. Smoke-released seed dormancy is beneficial on two counts: it increases the chance of recruitment under the present fireprone climate and increases the chances of survival should the wet season shift to another time of year where temperatures are higher or lower. Four pathways can be recognized with respect to the fire regimes induced by climate changes: (1) from non-fireprone to fireprone habitats (gains fire-adapted trait, 13 studies covering the last 115 million years (My) described here); (2) from a surface fire to a crown fire-type habitat (gains a different fire-adapted trait, 13 studies); (3) from a crown fire-type to surface fire-type habitat (loss of fire-adapted trait, 12 studies); and (4) from moderately burnt (crown fire) to non-fireprone habitat, such as desert, rainforest, or alpine habitats (loss of fire-adapted trait, 6 studies). Four case studies, at decreasing taxonomic rank, are used to illustrate the intimate relationship between climate change with its associated vegetation and fire regime change as they promote adaptive trait evolution: gain then loss of heat-released seed dormancy in Dipterocarpaceae-Cistaceae-Bixaceae over 90 My, gain then loss of serotiny in Callitroid Cupressaceae over the last 65 My, gain then loss of smoke-released seed dormancy in Proteoid Proteaceae over the last 120 My, and gain then loss of resprouting and serotiny among Hakea species (Grevilleoid Proteaceae) over the last 20 My. Examples of within-species rates of migration and trait change, including a model describing increasing degree of serotiny with intensifying drought, are given. The relevance of this historical approach to current (anthropogenic) climate change and associated fire regime alteration is discussed. Despite major threats expected to species conservation status at both the macro-(biome) and micro-(population) scales, I conclude that insufficient time or opportunities remain for effective migration to less-stressed areas or suitable adaptive responses to climate/fire regime change to evolve.","[Lamont, Byron B.] Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Ecol Sect, POB U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia","Curtin University","Lamont, BB (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Sch Mol & Life Sci, Ecol Sect, POB U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.","B.Lamont@Curtin.edu.au","","Lamont, Byron/0000-0001-9279-7149","","","",NA,"112","2","2","4","11","SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","1385-0237","1573-5052","","PLANT ECOL","Plant Ecol.","JUL","2022","223","7","",NA,"SI",NA,"711","732","","10.1007/s11258-022-01232-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-022-01232-x","","MAR 2022","22","Plant Sciences; Ecology; Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Plant Sciences; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry","3I5UA",NA,"hybrid","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000776910500001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

We conducted a 10-month longitudinal study in northeastern Victoria, Australia, of the quality of fully expanded leaves of Eucalyptus gracilis, E. socialis, E. dumosa and E. incrassata. We measured N and available N (AvailN) as well as sideroxylonals and other formylated phloroglucinol compounds (FPCs) and related changes in concentration to tree phenology (flushing and flowering) and climatic conditions (temperature and rainfall). Concentrations of N, sideroxylonals and other FPCs differed significantly between species and with time as well as among trees within a species. AvailN also differed significantly between species and among trees within a species and with time for E. gracilis. Our analyses indicated that tree phenology affected N concentrations in E. gracilis only while climatic conditions affected N concentrations in E. gracilis, E. socialis and E. dumosa. Nitrogen concentrations in E. incrassata were unaffected by phenological or climatic factors. Tree phenology affected concentrations of sideroxylonals in E. gracilis and E. dumosa while climatic conditions affected concentrations of the same in E. socialis, E. dumosa and E. incrassata. The concentration of primary metabolites in expanded leaves of these eucalypts was relatively consistent compared to the concentration of quality reducing secondary metabolites which varied with the conditions experienced when leaves were expanding. Our results show that the foliar quality of leaves can be highly variable, with variations mediated by phenology and climate. These variations are likely to partially explain fluctuations in the abundance of chewing insect herbivores reliant on expanded leaves.","[Steinbauer, Martin J.; Watson, Simon J.] La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia; [Wallis, Ian R.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Davies, Noel W.] Univ Tasmania, Cent Sci Lab, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","La Trobe University; Australian National University; University of Tasmania","Steinbauer, MJ (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Dept Zool, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.","M.Steinbauer@latrobe.edu.au","Steinbauer, Martin James/A-8612-2011; Davies, Noel W/J-7714-2014; Watson, Simon/B-4232-2013","Steinbauer, Martin James/0000-0002-0345-2905; Davies, Noel W/0000-0002-9624-0935; Watson, Simon/0000-0001-6063-7327","Charles La Trobe Research Fellowship; Department of Zoology","Charles La Trobe Research Fellowship; Department of Zoology","Collection of leaves from Bronzewing Flora and Fauna Reserve was conducted under a Department of Sustainability and Environment Research Permit to MJS (No. 10005399).

Aristolochia galeata is a native climber found in the Cerrado biome, associated with road and gallery forest edges. The aims of this study were to investigate: embryo growth rate, morphology and seed germination parameters under different treatments. Embryos were excised to obtain embryo length at four stages: initial, seeds after coat rupture, radicle tip protrusion and cotyledon emergence from the seed coat. Germination tests were conducted at 30 degrees C under three nitrate concentrations (1, 10 and 20 mM), fluctuating temperature (27/20 degrees C) and light and dark conditions. We found that seeds have underdeveloped embryos, which take about 301 +/- 178 h (+/- SD) to achieve seed coat rupture, another 205 +/- 126 h to reach radicle protrusion and 176 +/- 76 h more to the final stage of cotyledon emergence. Germinability was above 52% in all treatments, except in the dark (15%). For all treatments, average germination time was above 290 +/- 123 h. Potassium nitrate increased germinability to > 87%. No particular treatment was required for embryo development, but seeds in the population that continued to germinate after 1 month were probably in various states of non-deep, simple morphophysiological dormancy. Increased germinability in nitrate treatments and light requirement for germination could prevent germination under unsuitable environmental conditions and be a strategy to increase seedling establishment in the cerrado.","[Borghetti, F.] Univ Brasilia, Dept Bot, Lab Termobiol, BR-70919900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Alves-Da-Silva, D.] Univ Brasilia, Dept Ecol, BR-70919900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Thompson, K.; Grime, J.

The maximum quantum efficiency of thylakoid electron transport at low PPFD (phi), and the thylakoid electron transport rate when PPFD absorbed by leaves was equal to 1200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) (J(e1200)) were estimated using a curve-fitting approach. Canopy absorptance of incident PPFD (alpha(c)) and leaf absorptance of incident PPFD (alpha(1)) were measured at regular intervals, Significant fluctuations in both phi and J(e1200) were observed over the season, and these appeared to be associated with different leaf temperatures on different measuring days, Measured values of J(e1200) declined in a linear fashion over the season, but the decline was more rapid in an older hybrid than in two more modern hybrids. All three hybrids could be differentiated from one another on the basis of J(e1200) measurements in the last part of the growing season. The two newer hybrids did not differ in their mean crop growth rates during this part of the season, however, despite the observed difference in J(e1200). Regression analyses revealed a strong relationship between mean crop growth rates and alpha(c)J(e1200), supporting the idea that chlorophyll fluorescence can be used to assess photosynthetic performance of maize under field conditions.

Japanese white birch (Betula platyphylla var. japonica) leaves that developed wholly during a period of drought showed an increase in leaf nitrogen and a decrease in leaf carbohydrates that could ameliorate photosynthetic down-regulation, defined as a decrease in V-cmax in response to elevated [CO2]. Photochemical quenching (q(P)) was decreased by elevated [CO2] but increased by drought when compared at a given intercellular [CO2] (C-i), indicating that elevated [CO2] could increase the risk of photoinhibition, whereas long-term drought could alleviate the risk of photoinhibition. However, only a small variation in q(P) was measured among seedlings in the various water availability x [CO2] treatment combinations, consistent with the small treatment differences in chronic photoinhibition among the seedlings, as indicated by the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence after overnight dark-adaptation. Our results suggest that the offsetting responses-reduced V-cmax plus increased C-i at elevated [CO2] and increased V-cmax, plus reduced C-i under drought conditions-resulted in a narrow range of susceptibility to photoinhibition at the growth [CO2] in Japanese white birch seedlings grown in various water availability x [CO2] treatment combinations.","Hokkaido Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0628516, Japan; Ryukoku Univ, Dept Environm Solut Technol, Otsu, Shiga 5202194, Japan; Hokkaido Univ Forests, FSC, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan","Forestry & Forest Products Research Institute - Japan; Ryukoku University; Hokkaido University","Kitao, M (corresponding author), Hokkaido Res Ctr, Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0628516, Japan.","kitao@ffpri.affrc.go.jp","Koike, Takayoshi/A-5204-2012","","","","",NA,"74","36","37","1","21","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0829-318X","1758-4469","","TREE PHYSIOL","Tree Physiol.","MAY","2007","27","5","",NA,"",NA,"727","735","","10.1093/treephys/27.5.727","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/27.5.727","","","9","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","168NM","17267363","Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000246531300009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Millions of people suffer from hunger and malnutrition. This claims the lives of people every year since fixed amount of land is available for farming. The realistic solution to this problem lies to utilize this available arable land to its fullest so as to meet ever increasing demand of food due to population growth. Although agricultural yield of crops should also increase as by 2050 food demands will get doubled. Change in climate is quite evident which is perceived by crops. It can further worsen this problem as temperature fluctuations cause the decline in yield of crops. So, stabilizing the population turns out to be the very daunting task. Plant with desired characters should be raised that should have the capability to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses which can be attained by using conventional breeding techniques but it is very time-consuming process. One way to circumvent all the hurdles is to make use of genetically modified crops. This technology assists the crops to grow much more at local level thereby helping to deal with global food crisis. These genetically modified crops tend to grow at fast rate than indigenous varieties. Moreover, it mitigates the food crisis along with poverty via increase in income of poor farmers. As per reports, genetically modified organisms (GMO) reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and pesticide usage. Both greenhouse gases and pesticides have very negative effect on environment. So, by reducing these harmful entities it paves the way for overall sustainable development. These genetically modified crops turn out to be not less than a magical wand having capability to tackle problems that world faces due to climate change and food crisis.","[Aslam, Saima; Gul, Nadia] Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Rajouri, J&K, India","","Aslam, S (corresponding author), Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Rajouri, J&K, India.","","GUL, NADIA/ABG-6763-2021","GUL, NADIA/0000-0001-6240-122X; ASLAM, SAIMA/0000-0001-7834-3423","","","",NA,"89","3","3","9","30","SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG","CHAM","GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","0921-092X","1872-4663","978-3-030-38152-3; 978-3-030-38151-6","WATER SCI TECHNOL LI","","","2020","91","","",NA,"",NA,"237","248","","10.1007/978-3-030-38152-3_13","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38152-3_13","10.1007/978-3-030-38152-3","","12","Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources","Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)","Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources","BR9ME",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000678143900014","View Full Record in Web of Science"

For six poplar (Populus) genotypes in a short-rotation plantation, we observed significant seasonal and genotypic variation in photosynthetic parameters, intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi) and leaf stable isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta O-18). The poplars maintained high photosynthetic rates (between 17.8 and 26.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) depending on genotypes) until late in the season, in line with their fast-growth habit. Seasonal fluctuations were mainly explained by variations in soil water availability and by stomatal limitation upon photosynthesis. Stomatal rather than biochemical limitation was confirmed by the constant intrinsic photosynthetic capacity (V-cmax) during the growing season, closely related to leaf nitrogen (N) content. Intrinsic water-use efficiency scaled negatively with carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13(bl)) and positively with the ratio between mesophyll diffusion conductance (g(m)) and stomatal conductance. The WUEi - Delta(13)Cbl relationship was partly influenced by g(m). There was a trade-off between WUEi and photosynthetic N-use efficiency, but only when soil water availability was limiting. Our results suggest that seasonal fluctuations in relation to soil water availability should be accounted for in future modelling studies assessing the carbon sequestration potential and the water-use efficiency of woody energy crops.","[Broeckx, L.

Cold acclimation and deacclimation and associated physiological adaptations were investigated from late September 2006 to early May 2007 in stems of field-grown H. macrophylla ssp. macrophylla (Thunb.) Ser. cv. Blaumeise and H. paniculata Sieb. cv. Kyushu. Acclimation and deacclimation appeared approximately synchronized in the two species, but they differed significantly in levels of mid-winter cold hardiness, rates of acclimation and deacclimation and physiological traits conferring tolerance to freezing conditions. Accumulation patterns of sucrose and raffinose in stems paralleled fluctuations in cold hardiness in both species, but H. macrophylla additionally accumulated glucose and fructose during winter, indicating species-specific differences in carbohydrate metabolism. Protein profiles differed between H. macrophylla and H. paniculata, but distinct seasonal patterns associated with winter acclimation were observed in both species. In H. paniculata concurrent increases in xylem sap abscisic acid (ABA) concentrations ([ABA](xylem)) and freezing tolerance suggests an involvement of ABA in cold acclimation. In contrast, ABA from the root system was seemingly not involved in cold acclimation in H. macrophylla, suggesting that species-specific differences in cold hardiness may be related to differences in [ABA](xylem). In both species a significant increase in stem freezing tolerance appeared long after growth ceased, suggesting that cold acclimation is more regulated by temperature than by photoperiod.","[Pagter, Majken; Petersen, Karen K.] Univ Aarhus, Dept Hort, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark; [Jensen, Christian R.; Liu, Fulai] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Agr Sci, DK-2630 Taastrup, Denmark; [Arora, Rajeev] Iowa State Univ, Dept Hort, Ames, IA 50011 USA","Aarhus University; University of Copenhagen; Iowa State University","Pagter, M (corresponding author), Univ Aarhus, Dept Hort, Kirstinebjergvej 10, DK-5792 Aarslev, Denmark.","majken.pagter@agrsci.dk","CALLISTA, audrey/AAD-8511-2022; Liu, Fulai/D-8357-2013","Liu, Fulai/0000-0002-5006-8965; Pagter, Majken/0000-0001-5441-1508","","","",NA,"67","51","57","1","43","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0031-9317","1399-3054","","PHYSIOL PLANTARUM","Physiol.

Pore-gas concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the upper 1.5 m of soil covers and overburden did not reach the threshold that poses a risk for plant growth. Below 1.5 m in the overburden, however, oxygen dropped to 0% and carbon dioxide rose to >16%. While methane concentrations were typically <1.7%, there was a peak in methane at one sampling location to concentrations >35%. Novel subsurface flux chambers were designed and fabricated to measure directly oxygen ingress through soil covers and carbon dioxide efflux from overburden into soil covers. Oxygen fluxes peaked at 18.0 kg/(m(2) a) and carbon dioxide fluxes peaked at 2.3 kg/(m(2) a). Soil cover material and placement thickness affected gas flux rates. Diffusive fluxes were calculated from soil gas profiles by estimating diffusion coefficients from position-dependent soil moisture and temperature. Advective fluxes were calculated from pressure gradients and in situ air conductivity. Advection dominated over diffusion in soil covers except for one location that was either a localised zone of microbial activity (hydrocarbon degradation or methane oxidation) or the overburden was coarser textured and responded quickly to barometric pressure fluctuations.","[Scale, Kyle O.] SRK Consulting, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Scale, Kyle O.; Fleming, Ian R.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Civil Geol & Environm Engn, Saskatoon, SK, Canada","University of Saskatchewan","Scale, KO (corresponding author), SRK Consulting, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.;Scale, KO (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Civil Geol & Environm Engn, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.","kscale@srk.com","","","Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance","Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance","Funding for this research was provided by the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance.

For the calibration and evaluation of parameters, the ALMANAC model was used with climate, soil, management, and yield for two growing seasons from 30 farms in three regions (Northeastern Mexico, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific Mexico). Statistical analyses were made using regression analysis and mean squared deviation and its three components, i.e., the squared bias, the lack of correlation weighted by the standard deviations, and the squared difference between standard deviations. Model simulations with a light extinction coefficient (k) of 0.69, maximum leaf area index of 7.5, leaf area index decline rate of 0.3, optimal and minimum temperature for plant growth of 32 degrees C and 11 degrees C, respectively, potential heat units of 6000 to 7400 degree days (base 11 degrees C), harvest index of 0.9; maximum crop height of 4.0 m, and root depth of 2.0 m showed highest accuracy and captured best the magnitude of yield fluctuations with a root mean squared deviation of 7.8 Mg ha(-1). The parameters were found to be reasonable to use in simulating sugarcane in diverse regions under rainfed conditions. Using a dynamic value of k (varying during the growing season) deserves further study as it may help improve crop model precision.","[Delia Baez-Gonzalez, Alma; Ramos-Gonzalez, Jose L.] INIFAP, Campo Expt Pabellon, Km 32-5 Carr, Pabellon De Arteaga 20660, Aguascalientes, Mexico; [Kiniry, James R.] ARS, USDA, Grassland Soil & Water Res Lab, 808 E Blackland Rd, Temple, TX 76502 USA; [Meki, Manyowa N.; Williams, Jimmy] AgriLife Res, Blackland Res & Extens Ctr, 720 E Blackland Rd, Temple, TX 76502 USA; [Alvarez-Cilva, Marcelino] Inst Nacl Invest Forest Agr & Pecuarias, Campo Expt Tecoman, Km 35, Tecoman 28930, Colima, Mexico; [Magallanes-Estala, Agustin] Inst Nacl Invest Forest Agr & Pecuarias, Campo Expt Rio Bravo, Km 61 Carr, Rio Bravo 88900, Tamaulipas, Mexico; [Zapata-Buenfil, Gonzalo] INIFAP, Campo Expt Chetumal, Km 25-2 Carr Chetumal Bacalar, Municipio Othon P Blanco 77900, Quintana Roo, Mexico","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","Baez-Gonzalez, AD (corresponding author), INIFAP, Campo Expt Pabellon, Km 32-5 Carr, Pabellon De Arteaga 20660, Aguascalientes, Mexico.","baez.alma@inifap.gob.mx; jim.kiniry@ars.usda.gov; nmeki@brc.tamus.edu; jwilliams@brc.tamus.edu; alvarez.marcelino@inifap.gob.mx; ramos.jose@inifap.gob.mx; magallanes.agustin@inifap.gob.mx; zapata.gonzalo@inifap.gob.mx","Baez-Gonzalez, Alma Delia/AAR-1836-2021","Baez-Gonzalez, Alma Delia/0000-0002-0973-9587","","","",NA,"73","12","12","0","11","MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","2071-1050","","","SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","AUG","2017","9","8","",NA,"",NA,"","","1337","10.3390/su9081337","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9081337","","","19","Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","FF3YT",NA,"gold, Green Submitted","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000408861800052","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Sea urchins were examined in three habitats in Saint Joseph Bay, Florida, which is within the northern limits of their distribution. Densities of sea urchins, which ranged as high as 35 individuals . m(-2) fluctuated seasonally at all sites and were higher in seagrass beds comprised of Thalassia testudinum than Syringodium filiforme or on a sand flat. A cold front caused large-scale, catastrophic mortality among adult, and especially juvenile, sea urchins in nearshore habitats of the Bay in the spring of 1993, leading to a dramatic decline in sea urchin densities at the Thalassia seagrass site. The population recovered over 6 months at this site and was attributable to immigration of new adults. Juvenile recruitment displayed both interannual and site-specific variability, with recruitment being highest in seagrass habitats in fall and spring. The most pronounced recruitment event occurred in fall 1993 at the Thalassia site. Spatial distributions of adult individuals ascertained monthly never varied from random in the seagrass beds (T. testudinum and S. filiforme) or during spring, summer or fall months on the sand flat. Nonetheless, aggregations of adult sea urchins were observed on the sand flat in the winter months and were associated with patchy distributions of plant food resources. Juvenile sea urchins (< 25 mm test diameter) exhibited aggregations at all sites and 67% of all juveniles under 10 mm test diameter (91 of 165 individuals observed) were found under the spine canopies of adults. Measurements of the inducibility of spawning indicated peak gametic maturity in all three sub-populations in spring and summer. Gonad indices varied between habitats and years, but distinct maxima were detected, particularly in spring 1993 and late summer 1994. The mean gonad index of individuals at the Syringodium seagrass site was 2- to 4-fold higher than the other sites in spring 1993 and gonad indices were much higher at all sites in spring of 1993 than 1994. Estimates of growth based on changes in size frequency cohorts coupled with measurements of growth hands on lantern demipyramids indicated that L. variegatus in three habitats of Saint Joseph Bay have similar growth rates and attain a mean test diameter of approximately 35 mm in one year. In contrast to populations within the central biogeographical range of the species, which may attain test diameters up to 90 mm, the largest individuals recorded in Saint Joseph Bay were 60 mm in test diameter, and almost all individuals were no more than 45 mm in test diameter or two years of age.

The principal adaptive strategy of the crop is drought escape through early phenology. In regions where average temperatures at flowering < 14-16 degrees C, such as southern Australia or northern South Asia, the lack of reproductive chilling tolerance forces chickpea to delay podset. This delay compromises drought escape by exposing chickpea to terminal drought during much of the pod filling phase, reducing yield potential and stability, depending on seasonal climatic fluctuations. This paper defines chickpea growing seasons in time throughout the crop's global production regions using published data and feedback from local breeders. This information is used to calculate and map regionally specific chickpea bioclimatic variables such as flowering phase temperatures and the peak rate of growing season temperature change. Flowering phase temperatures < 14 C are uncommon. Mediterranean climates in southern Australia, Chile, California and Portugal tend to be cool during flowering (< 15.4 degrees C), while much of WANA is moderate to warm (15.4-24.4 degrees C), with exceptions in coastal N Africa, the Nile valley and higher elevations in Morocco, the Balkans, central Afghanistan, NE and SW Iran. Ethiopia contains a wide range of flowering phase temperatures depending on altitude. In South Asia flowering phase temperatures tend to decrease with increasing latitude, with large cool regions in the Punjab, N Haryana, N Uttar Pradesh and the Nepali terai. Superimposing the peak rates of temperature change within the growing season identifies habitats which are likely to be consistently cool throughout the reproductive phase by eliminating regions with transient chilling stress, such as much of N South Asia. It is suggested that reproductive chilling tolerance is rare in chickpea because of the late Neolithic shift from autumn to spring sowing in WANA, and subsequent dissemination into predominantly moderate to warm flowering habitats with only transient low temperature stress. The search for reproductive chilling tolerance should concentrate on these relatively uncommon consistently cool habitats. These are not well represented in the world chickpea collection, a shortcoming which is exacerbated by the lack of passport data in regions of potential interest from Iran to Central Asia. An alternative strategy is to search for reproductive chilling tolerance in the wild Cicer species, which have maintained a winter annual lifecycle and appear to be more cold tolerant than the cultigen. This approach is limited by the lack of germplasm. Currently, there are <30 original wild accessions in the primary genepool of chickpea (C. reticulatutn, n = 18; C. echinospermum, n = 10) in the world's genebanks, so more collection is required.

Determining the changes in transpiration of this species in different climatic areas is important for revealing the acclimation mechanism of black locust and developing suitable forest management practices, particularly in the context of global climate change. Here, sap flow and canopy conductance of black locust plantation trees in semiarid (Yan'an) and subhumid (Yongshou) sites were quantified using Granier-type thermal dissipation probes and concurrent environmental observations from 2012 to 2017. Several physiological pa-rameters were measured throughout the growing season. The results showed that sap flow was correlated with phenological factors across seasons within a year. However, interannual changes in sap flow were affected mainly by the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) at the Yongshou site, and jointly by precipitation (P), soil water content, and P/ET0 at the Yan'an site. Sap flow response to meteorological factors showed less discrepancy between pre-and post-rainfall periods at the Yan'an site. Moreover, canopy conductance fluctuated less with a wider range of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and the slope of canopy resistance as a function of VPD was lower, indicating relatively lower sensitivity of stomatal conductance to environmental factors in Yan'an site. Physio-logical parameters, except for predawn leaf water potential, were significantly different between the two sites. The results suggested that black locust tended to reduce transpiration, modify leaf morphology, and improve water use efficiency to enhance its adaptability to the dryer site. The species changes stomatal regulation characteristics and general growth rate to acclimatize to distinct water habitats.","[Lyu, Jinlin; He, Qiu-Yue; Chen, Qiu-Wen; Li, Guoqing; Du, Sheng] Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess Pl, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lyu, Jinlin; Cheng, Ran-Ran; Li, Guoqing; Du, Sheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lyu, Jinlin] Inst Bot Shaanxi Prov, Shaanxi Engn Res Ctr Conservat & Utilizat Bot Reso, Xian Bot Garden Shaanxi Prov, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [He, Qiu-Yue] Shandong Agr & Engn Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Ran-Ran] Jingdezhen Univ, Dept Biol & Environm, Jingdezhen 333000, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Otsuki, Kyoichi] Kyushu Univ, Kasuya Res Forest, Fukuoka, 8112415, Japan; [Yamanaka, Norikazu] Tottori Univ, Arid Land Res Ctr, Hamasaka, Tottori 6800001, Japan","Northwest A&F University - China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Soil & Water Conservation (ISWC), CAS; Ministry of Water Resources; Shandong Agriculture & Engineering University; Kyushu University; Tottori University","Du, S (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess Pl, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Du, S (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Minist Water Resources, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.","shengdu@ms.iswc.ac.cn","Cheng, Ranran/HGA-8919-2022; He, Qiuyue/HDM-5188-2022; DU, SHENG/A-7528-2008","DU, SHENG/0000-0002-5580-399X","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0504601]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41471440, 41411140035]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","This study was supported by the National Key R & D Program of China (2017YFC0504601), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41471440, 41411140035), and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for a NSFC-JSPS joint research project.",NA,"96","6","6","20","47","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0378-3774","1873-2283","","AGR WATER MANAGE","Agric.

The existing studies present that climate change models with higher spatial resolution can be a way forward for future climate projections. Meanwhile, stochastic projections of more than one climate model are necessary for providing insights into model uncertainties as well as to develop risk management strategies. It is projected that water availability will increase in some parts of the world, which will have its own effect on water use efficiency and water allocation. Crop production can increase if irrigated areas are expanded or irrigation is intensified, but these may increase the rate of environmental degradation. Since climate change impacts on soil water balance will lead to changes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration, consequently, the crop growth period may shorten in the future impacting on water productivity. Crop yields affected by climate change are projected to be different in various areas, in some areas crop yields will increase, and for other areas it will decrease depending on the latitude of the area and irrigation application. Existing modelling results show that an increase in precipitation will increase crop yield, and what is more, crop yield is more sensitive to the precipitation than temperature. If water availability is reduced in the future, soils of high water holding capacity will be better to reduce the impact of drought while maintaining crop yield. With the temperature increasing and precipitation fluctuations, water availability and crop production are likely to decrease in the future. If the irrigated areas are expanded, the total crop production will increase; however, food and environmental quality may degrade.

The present study aimed to investigate the inherent physiological plasticity of early diverging, extant species following acclimation to an atmosphere similar to that across the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction interval (TJB, approx. 200 Mya), a time of major ecological change. Methods Mature plants from two angiosperm (Drimys winteri and Chloranthus oldhamii), two monilophyte (Osmunda claytoniana and Cyathea australis) and one gymnosperm (Ginkgo biloba) species were grown for 2 months in replicated walk-in Conviron BDW40 chambers running at TJB treatment conditions of 16 % [O-2]1900 ppm [CO2] and ambient conditions of 21 % [O-2]-400 ppm [CO2], and their physiological plasticity was assessed using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence methods. Key Results TJB acclimation caused significant reductions in the maximum rate of carboxylation (V-Cmax) and the maximum electron flow supporting ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate regeneration (J(max)) in all species, yet this downregulation had little effect on their light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(sat)). Ginkgo was found to photorespire heavily under ambient conditions, while growth in low [O-2]:[CO2] resulted in increased heat dissipation per reaction centre (DIo/RC), severe photodamage, as revealed by the species' decreased maximum efficiency of primary photochemistry (F-v/F-m) and decreased in situ photosynthetic electron flow (J(situ)). Conclusions It is argued that the observed photodamage reflects the inability of Ginkgo to divert excess photosynthetic electron flow to sinks other than the downregulated C-3 and the diminished C-2 cycles under low [O-2]:[CO2]. This finding, coupled with the remarkable physiological plasticity of the ferns, provides insights into the underlying mechanism of Ginkgoales' near extinction and ferns' proliferation as atmospheric [CO2] increased to maximum levels across the TJB.","[Yiotis, C.; Gerald, C.

An integrated solid-phase denitrification biofilter (SDNF) was developed with dual media to remove nitrate and suspended solids (SS) from the secondary effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants. Biodegradable polymer pellets of polycaprolactone (PCL) served as the biofiltration medium and carbon source for denitrification. Long-term continuous operation of the SDNF was conducted with real secondary effluent to evaluate the denitrification performance and effects of influent nitrate loading rates (NLR) and operating temperatures. The results indicated that both nitrate and SS were effectively removed. The SDNF had a strong tolerance for fluctuations in influent NLR, and a maximum denitrification rate of 3.80 g N/(L.d) was achieved. The low temperature had a significant impact on nitrogen removal, yet the denitrification rate was still maintained at a relative high level to as much as 1.23 g N/(L.d) even at approximately 8.0 degrees C in winter. Nitrite accumulation and excessive organics residue in the effluent were avoided throughout the whole experiment, except on occasional days in the lag phase. The observed biomass yield was calculated to be 0.44 kgVSS/kgPCL. The microbial diversity and community structure of the biofilm in the SDNF were revealed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The special carbon source led to an obvious succession of microbial community from the initial inoculum (activated sludge from aerobic tanks), and included a decrease in microbial diversity and a shift in the dominant groups, which were identified to be members of the family Comamonadaceae in the SDNF. The SDNF developed in this study was verified to be an efficient technology for tertiary nitrogen removal from secondary effluent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Wetlands at Long Point, Lake Erie, have some of the most important habitats for staging waterfowl on the Great Lakes and anecdotal evidence suggests that Phragmites has been expanding rapidly in some of these wetlands. To make informed management decisions, a better understanding of historical changes in distribution and abundance of this species is needed, as well as the ability to identify which plant species/communities Phragmites is replacing. Long Point's wetland communities were digitally mapped from aerial photographs from 1945 to 1999. The aerial extent of Phragmites stands was measured by digitizing vegetation boundaries, ground-truthing, and analyzing the data using a GIS. A geometric growth formula was used to determine the intrinsic rate of change of Phragmites over time. Phragmites abundance fluctuated throughout the period (1945: 4 ha; 1955: 7.7 ha; 1964: 69 ha; 1968: 3.6 ha; 1972: 15.1 ha; 1978: 17.7 ha; 1985: < 4 ha; 1995: 18 ha; 1999: 137 ha), but its abundance increased exponentially between 1995 and 1999 (137 ha; intrinsic rate of growth in area = +0.50/yr). The species/communities that were most often replaced by Phragmites between 1995 and 1999 were Typha spp. (33.8%), marsh meadow (31%), sedge/grass hummock (10.8%), and other mixed emergents (9.6%). Of 31 stands analyzed within the study area, 28 (90%) were of a non-native strain of Phragmites australis (haplotype M) that has been rapidly expanding throughout the Atlantic region of the United States. We suggest that the recent rapid expansion of Phragmites at Long Point is the direct result of this exotic invasion, and that it has been facilitated by both declines in Great Lakes water levels and increases in ambient air temperatures; anthropogenic and natural disturbances have possibly also contributed. Given the invasive nature of the exotic genotype, combined with future global warming predictions, Phragmites probably will continue to rapidly expand throughout lower Great Lakes coastal wetlands.","Bird Studies Canada, Long Point Waterfowl & Wetlands Res Fund, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada; Environm Canada, Canadian Wildlife Serv, London, ON N6P 1R1, Canada; Univ Western Ontario, Dept Biol, London, ON N6A 5B7, Canada","Environment & Climate Change Canada; Canadian Wildlife Service; Western University (University of Western Ontario)","Petrie, SA (corresponding author), Bird Studies Canada, Long Point Waterfowl & Wetlands Res Fund, POB 160, Port Rowan, ON N0E 1M0, Canada.","spetrie@bsc-eoc.org","","","","","",NA,"37","90","96","8","96","INT ASSOC GREAT LAKES RES","ANN ARBOR","2205 COMMONWEALTH BLVD, ANN ARBOR, MI 48105 USA","0380-1330","","","J GREAT LAKES RES","J.

In a pot experiment, plants were subjected to two treatments: shading during stem elongation, reducing growth; and climatic stress (low radiation and chilling) at meiosis, inducing pollen sterility. The percentage of grain setting among the two oldest florets within each spikelet (LF) and the ratios of grain number to (i) biomass of the chaff and (ii) biomass of the straw plus chaff were markedly reduced by the stress at meiosis and either little or not affected by shading during stem elongation. Two indices were tested in the field: LF and the ratio, RK, of the grain number per ear to an estimate, based on chaff biomass, of the potential number in the absence of sterility. These indices were measured in a network of five field experiments with six cultivars. The fluctuations in the indices were compared to those of a reference criterion that identified sterility: the rate of grain setting among the two oldest florets of each spikelet, measured in bagged ears to prevent cross-pollination. Both indices were reduced when the reference criterion diagnosed a major sterility but they did not always decrease in case of minor sterility. Classification of the cultivars based on the reference criterion was similar to that based on LF, but not on RK. LF diagnosis of sterility was in agreement with the occurrence of climatic conditions likely to induce sterility.","INRA, STN AMELIORAT PLANTES, F-35650 LE RHEU, FRANCE; INST TECH CEREALES & FOURRAGES, F-78280 GUYANCOURT, FRANCE","INRAE","Demotes-Mainard, S (corresponding author), INRA, INA PG, AGRON LAB, F-78850 THIVERVAL GRIGNON, FRANCE.","","","","","","",NA,"41","6","6","0","10","ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV","AMSTERDAM","PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1161-0301","","","EUR J AGRON","Eur.

We therefore need a better understanding of how climate variability constrains wood anatomy and tree radial growth. Pinus tabuliformis dominates natural forests and plantations over the western Qinling Mountains, which is one of the ecologically vulnerable areas in China. Here, we investigated the response of P. tabuliformis tree-ring anatomical structure to climate variability by applying wood anatomy analysis, and evaluated the influences of anatomical traits on potential hydraulic functions and the climate significance of intraannual density fluctuations (IADFs). We found that with the increasing temperature from spring to summer, the negative effect of temperature on the formation and enlargement of earlywood and transition-wood tracheids was gradually enhanced. However, spring precipitation not only had a direct and positive influence on the formation of earlywood, but also had a delaying impact on the transition-wood cell enlargement. Besides, the smaller earlywood tracheid size of P. tabuliformis could be a substantially characteristic reflecting spring drought. The contribution of lumen diameter on conduit wall reinforcement was dominated in earlywood, while the contribution of cell wall thickness was greater than that of lumen diameter in latewood. The different contributions of anatomical traits on conduit wall reinforcement would further affect the response of potential hydraulic function to climate. IADFs of P. tabuliformis could be a potential indicator to reflect the abnormal summer precipitation events in the western Qinling Mountains. IADFs with strong and weak intensity indicated years with high and low rates of change in mid-summer precipitation, respectively. Future warmer and drier climate in the western Qinling Mountains will likely result in the production of smaller tracheids to ensure hydraulic safety, which means the stronger drought resistant of P. tabuliformis in the future. In this study, we linked the xylem anatomy and potential hydraulics functions with intra-seasonal climate variability in the context of climate warming and drying, and proposed some xylem anatomical indices reflecting potential drought events.","[Hong, Yixue; Zhang, Lingnan; Liu, Xiaohong; Zeng, Xiaomin; Lu, Qiangqiang; Wang, Keyi; Wang, Yabo; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Wenchao] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Xian 710119, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaohong] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Aritsara, Amy Ny Aina] Guangxi Univ, State Key Lab Conservat & Utilizat Subtrop Agrobi, Plant Ecophysiol & Evolut Grp, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Xing, Xiaoyu] Qinling Natl Bot Garden, Xian 710061, Peoples R China; [Lu, Qiangqiang] Inst Bot Shaanxi Prov, Xian Bot Garden Shaanxi Prov, Xian 710061, Peoples R China","Shaanxi Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Guangxi University","Zhang, LN; Liu, XH (corresponding author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Xian 710119, Peoples R China.","zln@snnu.edu.cn; xhliu@snnu.edu.cn","Amy Ny Aina, Aritsara/ABC-4648-2021","Amy Ny Aina, Aritsara/0000-0001-9246-6577","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41801024, 42171055, 41971104]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [GK202107009, 2020CSLY011, 2020CBLY010, 2019TS017]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41801024, 42171055 and 41971104) and partially supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Projects GK202107009, 2020CSLY011, 2020CBLY010 and 2019TS017).",NA,"66","2","2","12","48","ELSEVIER GMBH","MUNICH","HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY","1125-7865","1612-0051","","DENDROCHRONOLOGIA","Dendrochronologia","DEC","2021","70","","",NA,"",NA,"","","125881","10.1016/j.dendro.2021.125881","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2021.125881","","SEP 2021","10","Forestry; Geography, Physical","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry; Physical Geography","WA4WF",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000702886600002","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The maximum and mean densities (n = number of individuals) of B. longimanus were larger in Island Lake Reservoir (> 100 n m(-3) and 20-57 n m(-3), respectively) and in most other reservoirs than in natural lakes. Island Lake Reservoir and most other reservoir populations also exhibited multiple (up to six) cycles of growth and collapse per season, and performed extensive diel vertical migrations (DVM) to near the lake bottom during the day. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the population dynamics of B. longimanus in Island Lake Reservoir were governed by relaxed top-down control by fish predation and strong bottom-up control by food availability. Developmental stage-specific death rates predicted from a matrix model were density dependent, aligned with predictions of bottom-up control (e. g., largest for the smallest instars, and correlated with food resources), and were inconsistent with anticipated prey demands by fishes. The reproductive and DVM trends of B. longimanus also indicated food stress and abated top-down control, respectively. We propose a mechanistic basis for invasion success in reservoirs by linking several limnological attributes, including chlorophyll a, water level fluctuation, light penetration, and thermal conditions to increased growth potential of B. longimanus.","[Brown, Meghan E.; Branstrator, Donn K.; Shannon, Lyle J.] Univ Minnesota Duluth, Dept Biol, Duluth, MN USA","University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota Hospital","Brown, ME (corresponding author), Hobart & William Smith Coll, Dept Biol, Geneva, NY 14456 USA.","mbrown@hws.edu","","","Minnesota Sea Grant College; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration office of Sea, United States Department of Commerce [NA16-RG1046]; University of Minnesota; NSF ADVANCE [0620087, 0620101]","Minnesota Sea Grant College; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration office of Sea, United States Department of Commerce; University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); NSF ADVANCE(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD))","We thank D.

More frequent and extreme drought events are increasing around the world, which may affect plant physiological reactions and vegetation restoration activities. The present study explored the seasonal trends of sap flow in Salix psammiphlia (S-f) by continuously collecting data on abiotic factors (net radiation [R-n], atmospheric relative humidity [R-h], atmospheric temperature [T], saturated vapor pressure difference [VPD], wind speed at 2 m height [U-2], soil water storage [SWS], soil tem-perature [ST]) and transpiration rate (T-s) in the Mu Us Desert. According to the results, S-f exhibited considerable seasonal trends accompanied by a unimodal pattern during the growing season, and with a bimodal pattern during the dormant season. Notably, the ratio of nocturnal sap flow to whole daily sap flow could increase by up to 100% (from October to December and March to May). Multivariate stepwise regression and structural equation modeling results suggested that different factors drive the seasonal trends. During the growing season, R-n , VPD, and U-2 controlled T-s directly (R-2 = 0.80). While T-s was directly controlled by R-h , T, U-2 , SWS2 (20-100 cm) and ST_50 during the dormant season (R-2 = 0.43). Topsoil freezing in winter may led to water stress in S. psammiphlia , and then appeared the bimodal pattern. The plants survived freezing drought water stress by using the soil moisture stored in the deep soil layer (50-100 cm) and reducing T-s, or even temporarily stopping transpiration. According to this data, the threshold of S. psammophila in the region was estimated to be 480-540 clusters/ha(2). These findings could guide ecosystem restoration activities and facilitate sustainable development in dry and degraded regions.","[Chen, Yunfei; He, Junqi; He, Yi; Gao, Wande; Zheng, Ce; Liu, Xiuhua] Changan Univ, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Effect Arid Reg, Minist Educ, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yunfei; He, Junqi; He, Yi; Gao, Wande; Zheng, Ce; Liu, Xiuhua] Changan Univ, Sch Water & Environm, Xian 710054, Peoples R China","Chang'an University; Chang'an University","He, JQ (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Sch Water & Environm, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.","hejunqi@chd.edu.cn","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41877179, 42001033]; Shaanxi Water Conservancy Science and Technology plan project [2019slkj-18]; Central University Special Fund [300102291507]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shaanxi Water Conservancy Science and Technology plan project; Central University Special Fund","This study was financially supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41877179, 42001033), the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Science and Technology plan project (2019slkj-18), and the Central University Special Fund (300102291507).",NA,"65","1","1","15","31","ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1470-160X","1872-7034","","ECOL INDIC","Ecol.

To understand the dynamics between striped bass Morone saxatilis and threadfin shad Dorosoma petenense in Lake Powell, Utah-Arizona, we (1) synthesized and evaluated 20 years of historical data on temperature, diet, growth, and abundance of these fish, (2) collected similar data on a finer scale in 2003-2004, (3) used components of this data set to develop specific conversions between coarser historic data and present data, and (4) modeled striped bass and threadfin shad dynamics within a bioenergetics framework. We estimated the consumption of threadfin shad by age-0, subadult, and adult striped bass in Lake Powell from 1985 to 2003. During this period, threadfin shad abundance peaked at approximately 5- to 7-year intervals and striped bass growth, condition, and abundance corresponded closely to peaks in threadfin shad foraging. Individual consumption of threadfin shad by striped bass was highest for adults followed by subadult and age-0 fish; scaling individual consumption up to the population level resulted in highly variable subadult consumption that fluctuated from highs of about 1.2 million kg (18.4 kg/ha) to lows of about 0.3 million kg (4.6 kg/ha) on a 1- to 2-year cycle. Despite these fluctuations, the consumption of threadfin shad was dominated by subadult striped bass, which appeared to control threadfin shad numbers in all but the highest peak years of shad abundance. Based on bioenergetics output, striped bass demonstrate a type 11 functional feeding response; consumption rates reach an asymptote when the threadfin shad biomass index exceeds 10,000 kg/year. We demonstrate a modeling approach that allowed us to evaluate the large fluctuations in predator and prey populations, which often become evident only over long time periods.

Field experiments were completed in which the physical dimensions of patches infested with cereal aphids, cereal aphid density, and access to patches by coccinellids were varied. Aphid infestations consisted of naturally occurring densities (natural patches) and much greater densities created by supplementing patches with aphids (supplemented patches). Coccinellids were denied access to some supplemented patches (exclusion patches) but allowed unlimited access to others. Densities of adult Hippodamia convergens and Coccinella septem-punctata were correlated with aphid density in patches whereas density of Coleomegilla maculata was not. Aggregation by coccinellids was independent of patch area. The realized aphid population growth rate (r) was lower in supplemented than natural patches in all four trials but was significantly lower in only one trial. The lower r in supplemented patches was not exclusively caused by coccinellid predation, and emigration of aphids from patches probably also contributed, r was significantly greater in exclusion patches than supplemented and natural patches, indicating that coccinellids markedly reduced aphid numbers in patches even when aphid density was extremely high.","USDA ARS, Plant Sci & Water Conservat Res Lab, Stillwater, OK 74075 USA; USDA ARS, No Grain Insects Res Lab, Brookings, SD USA","United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)","Elliott, NC (corresponding author), USDA ARS, Plant Sci & Water Conservat Res Lab, 1301 N Western St, Stillwater, OK 74075 USA.","","","","","","",NA,"38","36","38","0","17","SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO","TOKYO","3-3-13, HONGO, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN","1438-3896","","","POPUL ECOL","Popul.

Little is understood about the drivers of its periodic presence and absence or how it survives unfavourable periods. Studying the effect of starvation, we evaluated the main metabolic expenses (reproduction, respiration and excretion) during those periods. P. noctiluca could shrink in size, losing up to 85% of their mass (6.6-7.1% loss day(-1)), while continuing to release eggs quasi-daily over a 28-day period. Egg production was proportional to size (mean 759 eggs day(-1) at 6 cm bell diameter), with up to 19 526 eggs released in a single spawn, thereby providing huge potential for population growth despite undergoing starvation. Small food rations decreased the rate of shrinking to 3.1% day(-1), prolonging life (49 days), potentially enhancing the chances of encountering more prey and regrowing. Metabolism increased with wet mass (allometric exponent: 0.93 for respiration, 0.82 for ammonium), however reproduction was the greatest carbon expenditure for individuals larger than 9 cm bell diameter. Temperature (9-29 degrees C) also significantly increased both respiration and, to a greater extent, excretion (Q(10) = 2.25 and 4.76). Consequentially a warming ocean may negatively affect survival rates unless prey abundance balances the increased metabolic demands.","[Lilley, Martin K.

Density dependence was the main driver of the population dynamics studied, and it was exhibited more frequently under zero tillage (86% of the species) than under minimum tillage (57% of the species). Our results confirmed previous findings and provided stronger support for density dependence under zero tillage than under minimum tillage. Under the latter, temperature negatively affected the population growth rate of Descurainia sophia and positively Atriplex patula.

In indeterminate greenhouse crops, alternating periods of fruit abortion and fruit set exist, resulting in fluctuations in fruit yield. Factors affecting the level of abortion are e. g., the supply and demand for assimilates (source and sink strength, respectively), temperature and cultivar. However, simulation of fruit abortion is still a weak part of crop simulation models. Variation in fruit abortion exists between plants, which results in differences in the timing and the number of set fruits. Therefore, simulating fruit abortion with variation could give more realistic simulation results. The probability of a fruit to abort should be related to factors like source strength and sink strength. The more favourable the circumstances are for fruit abortion, e.g., low source strength or high sink strength, the more likely it is that the fruit aborts. Survival analysis estimates parameters quantifying the influence of explanatory variables on the abortion rate. Time-varying explanatory variables can be used in the analysis. In a case study, we used survival analysis to analyse a data set with observations on flowering, fruit abortion and fruit harvest for sweet pepper. Source and sink strength were used as explanatory variables. The resulting equation determining the probability of abortion per day was implemented in a simple simulation model to simulate fruit set. The model output, as an average of 100 plants, showed similar timing in the fluctuations in fruit set as the observations, although the amplitude of the fluctuations was in some cases underestimated. The percentage fruit set was simulated correctly.","[Wubs, A. M.; Heuvelink, E.] Wageningen Univ, Hort Supply Chains, POB 630, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands; [Wubs, A.

Excess nutrients are subject to runoff and leaching, which raises environmental concerns in Florida watersheds. A field study was conducted to elucidate N spatial distribution in tomato beds during the 2006 spring and winter growing seasons with 224 and 358 kg N ha(-1) rates. Ammonium N was highest for both seasons during 0 to 1 wk after planting (WAP) at the 0- to 10-cm depth in the fertilizer band, but rarely moved vertically. Lateral movement of NH4+-N was observed through 7 WAP, however, probably due to diffusion. Nitrate N at 0 to 10 cm in the band peaked during 3 to 4 WAP, indicating about 3 wk of nitrification in the spring; however, this process was shortened to 1 to 2 wk in the winter, probably due to greater bacterial activity with warmer temperatures in the beginning of the winter than the spring (average 8 C in the first 3 wk). Both lateral and vertical movements of NO3--N were observed in the spring, even at the 20- to 30-cm depth. A rise and subsequent fall of the water table level during 5 to 8 WAP particularly enhanced NO3--N downward movement, which was attributed to greater diffusivity of NO3--N than NH4+-N. Minimizing water table fluctuations and applying a reduced N rate are critical to reduce NO3--N leaching loss.","[Sato, Shinjiro; Morgan, Kelly T.; Ozores-Hampton, Monica] Univ Florida, SW Florida Resear & Educ Ctr, Immokalee, FL 34142 USA; [Simonne, Eric H.] Univ Florida, Dept Hort Sci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA","State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida","Sato, S (corresponding author), Univ Florida, SW Florida Resear & Educ Ctr, 2686 State Rd 29N, Immokalee, FL 34142 USA.","shinjiro@ifas.ufl.edu","","","Florida Dep. of Agriculture and Consumer Services [12280]","Florida Dep. of Agriculture and Consumer Services","This research was funded by the Florida Dep. of Agriculture and Consumer Services (no. 12280) and institutionally made possible by the UF-IFAS Southwest Florida Research and Education Center (SWFREC).

Ground-layer vegetation can change the availability and variability of microclimates; however, gaps in our understanding of how individuals interact with the microclimates created by vegetation limit our ability to inform management actions for wildlife. Amphibians can simultaneously balance operant body temperatures and water loss and the availability of heterogeneous microclimates should moderate how effectively they are able to do so. However, relatively few studies have attempted to mechanistically demonstrate how ground vegetation-driven effects on microclimatic variation may affect amphibian performance and survival. Agent-based modeling (ABM) can incorporate behavior and other mechanisms to understand how animals interact with their environments to result in larger scale patterns. They are effective for exploring alternative scenarios and representing the uncertainty in systems. Here, we use ABMs to integrate field and laboratory measurements of movement behavior, physiology, and plant effects on near-ground microclimate to explore how ground vegetation and the availability of terrestrial refugia may affect the survival and terrestrial distributions of juvenile gopher frogs (Rana capito) under two weather regimes. We also examine how assumptions regarding micro-scale movement (< 1 m(2)) affect the influence of ground vegetation on survival and settlement within refugia. While all variables affected settlement and survival, our models predict that inter-annual variation in weather and the density and spatial distribution of permanent refugia likely have the greatest influence on juvenile survival. The benefit of increased ground vegetation was dependent on the reasonable assumption that gopher frogs exhibit microclimate habitat selection throughout the day and night to limit water loss. Our models suggest that vegetation would be most beneficial to amphibians under warmer weather regimes provided there is sufficient rainfall.","[Burrow, Angela K.; Maerz, John C.] Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [McEntire, Kira D.] Queens Univ Charlotte, Coll Arts & Sci, Charlotte, NC USA","University System of Georgia; University of Georgia","Burrow, AK (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Warnell Sch Forestry & Nat Resources, Athens, GA 30602 USA.","angela.burrow@cornell.edu","","","","","",NA,"82","0","0","1","1","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","2296-701X","","","FRONT ECOL EVOL","Front.

Thermophilic hydrogen fermentation was established at 60 degrees C in the first bioreactor by inoculating with seed microflora. Following the hydrogenogenic process, methanogenesis in the second bioreactor was conducted at 55 degrees C using an internal recirculation packed-bed reactor (IRPR). After conducting steady-state operations under a few selected conditions, the overall hydraulic retention time was optimized at 8 d (hydrogenogenesis, 1.2 d; methanogenesis, 6.8 d), producing 5.4 m(3)/m(3)/d of hydrogen and 6.1 m(3)/m(3)/d of methane with chemical oxygen demand and volatile suspended solid removal efficiencies of 79.3% and 87.8%, respectively. Maximum hydrogen production yield was calculated to be 2.4 mol/mol hexose and 56 L/kg COD loaded. The methanogenic performance of the IRPR was stable, although the organic loading rate and the composition of the effluent from the hydrogenogenic process fluctuated substantially. A clone library analysis of the microflora in the hydrogenogenic reactor indicated that hydrogen-producing Thermoanaerobacterium-related organisms in the inoculum were active in the hydrogen fermentation of garbage and paper wastes, although no aseptic operations were applied. We speculate that the operation at high temperature and the inoculation of thermophiles enabled the selective growth of the introduced microorganisms and gave hydrogen fermentation efficiencies comparable to laboratory experiments. This is the first report on fermentative production of hydrogen and methane from organic waste at an actual level.","Kajima Tech Res Inst, Environm & Bioengn Grp, Chofu, Tokyo 1820036, Japan","","Ueno, Y (corresponding author), Kajima Tech Res Inst, Environm & Bioengn Grp, 2-19-1 Tobitakyu, Chofu, Tokyo 1820036, Japan.","uenoyo@kajima.com","","","","","",NA,"33","172","181","3","81","AMER CHEMICAL SOC","WASHINGTON","1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA","0013-936X","1520-5851","","ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL","Environ.

The mechanism for the fluctuation between 1994 and 1997 is discussed. Inter-tree difference in the time of bud swelling is probably genetically based, since most of the trees that began to swell early in 1995 also swelled early in 1997, and those that began to swell late also did so in both years. Damage severity of each tree was evaluated by damage ratio: proportion of the number of damaged current shoots on the previous year's leader shoot. The rank of the bud swelling phenology of a tree was positively correlated to the rank of the damage ratio. This means that genetically based differences in phenology could explain why some trees are subjected to higher levels of herbivory than others. There was year-to-year variation in the damage severity for each tree. Nevertheless, no significant differences were found in the rank of the damage ratio between years. However the standard deviation of the damage ratios of each tree was highest for trees of intermediate rank. The skew of the frequency distribution of damage ratio was negatively correlated to the cumulated daily mean temperature in spring, which means that the spruce is more susceptible to the sawfly in warm springs than in cool springs. The mean growth rate of the lightly damaged trees increased constantly, while that of the heavily damaged trees seemed to reach a limit and then became lower than that of the lightly damaged trees.","Hokkaido Forestry Res Inst, Dohoku Branch Stn, Nakagawa, Hokkaido 0982805, Japan; Hokkaido Forestry Res Inst, Bibai, Hokkaido 0790198, Japan","","Masaka, K (corresponding author), Hokkaido Forestry Res Inst, Dohoku Branch Stn, Homare 300, Nakagawa, Hokkaido 0982805, Japan.","","","","","","",NA,"29","2","3","0","3","MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD","COPENHAGEN","35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK","0906-7590","","","ECOGRAPHY","Ecography","OCT","2000","23","5","",NA,"",NA,"547","552","","10.1034/j.1600-0587.2000.230505.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0587.2000.230505.x","","","6","Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","366YY",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000090034900005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

The possibility that the performance of E. abietinum is reduced on previously infested Sitka spruce, and that this is the cause of year-to-year fluctuations in population density, was investigated by comparing population development and the growth rate of individual aphids on experimentally defoliated trees. 2 Separate experiments were performed to determine whether aphid performance was reduced either in the autumn immediately after defoliation in the spring, or was reduced in the spring of the next year. Different rates of initial defoliation on trees used to test aphid performance were created by artificially infesting the trees with aphids in the spring before the experiments, and varying the time of infestation. 3 Population development and the mean relative growth rate (MRGR) of individual aphids on previously defoliated and undefoliated Sitka spruce did not differ significantly in the spring of the next year. No differences were observed in the nutrient content of the 1-year-old needles of previously defoliated or undefoliated trees at this time. 4 In the autumn and winter immediately after spring defoliation, aphid MRGR was significantly higher on trees that had been heavily defoliated earlier in the season compared with trees that had been lightly defoliated. However, the difference in MRGR decreased over the winter period. Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium concentrations were 9.4-12.2% higher, at the beginning of the autumn, in the current year needles of heavily defoliated trees than in the current year needles of lightly defoliated trees. 5 The experiments indicate that high populations of E. abietinum in the spring do not induce any defensive mechanisms in Sitka spruce that adversely affect subsequent generations of the aphid. By contrast, the results suggest that high spring densities of the aphid improve the nutritional quality of the current year's foliage for autumn generations.","Forest Res, Tree Hlth Div, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England; Univ Ulster, Sch Environm Studies, Coleraine BT52 1SA, Londonderry, North Ireland","Ulster University","Williams, DT (corresponding author), Forest Res, Tree Hlth Div, Alice Holt Lodge, Farnham GU10 4LH, Surrey, England.","david.t.williams@forestry.gsi.gov.uk","","","","","",NA,"50","16","16","0","7","BLACKWELL PUBL LTD","OXFORD","108 COWLEY RD, OXFORD OX4 1JF, OXON, ENGLAND","1461-9555","","","AGR FOREST ENTOMOL","Agric.

The dynamics of the population were influenced mainly by density-dependent harvesting, stochastic variation in climate and intrinsic variation in the age-structure of the female segment of the population. 3. A time delay in the assignment of hunting permits in relation to population size increased fluctuations in population size. 4. Selective harvesting of calves and yearlings increased the mean age of adult females in the population, and, because fecundity in moose is strongly age-specific, the number of calves per female concordantly increased. However. after years with high recruitment, the adult mean age decreased as large cohorts entered the adult age-groups. This age-structure effect generated cycles in the rate of recruitment to the population and fluctuations introduced time-lags in the population dynamics. 5. An inverse relationship between recruitment rate and population density, mediated by a density-dependent decrease in female body condition, could potentially have constituted a regulatory mechanism in the dynamics of the population, but this effect was counteracted by a density-dependent increase in the mean age of adult females. 6.

We investigated the effects of two differing freeze-thaw regimes, each of which is realistic of in situ spatial and temporal variation in field conditions, on C and N dynamics in sub-arctic heath tundra mesocosms. In addition, N-15 isotopic label was used to follow the partitioning of a labile N pool between major ecosystem components, both during the freeze-thaw treatments phase, and in a subsequent equilibration phase. A single deep freeze treatment phase enhanced dissolved total and labelled N pools in the soil solution at initial thaw, and resulted in reduced pool sizes at the end of the equilibration phase. By contrast, a multiple freeze-thaw cycling treatment directly enhanced the dissolved labelled N pool, but did not significantly affect dissolved total N. Furthermore, both dissolved labelled N and dissolved total N pools were significantly enhanced in the equilibration period following multiple freeze-thaw, the latter due to a marked increase in soil solution NH4+. Microbial biomass C was not significantly affected by either of the freezing treatments upon final thaw, but was significantly reduced over the combined treatment and equilibration phases of the multiple freeze-thaw regimes. Furthermore, the treatments had no significant effects on total or labelled N within the microbial biomass over either phase. Total mesocosm CO2 efflux rates remained closely correlated with soil temperature throughout the experiment in both regimes, suggesting that respiratory flushes associated with treatment-induced microbial cell lysis were negligible. Together, these results indicate that moderate freeze-thaw fluctuations may have minimal influences on microbial biomass pools, but nevertheless can have strong contrasting effects on the amounts, forms, and timing of N and organic C supply into the soil solution. Ecosystem losses via N2O effluxes were of greatest magnitude immediately upon thawing in both treatments, and were of similar total magnitude to inorganic N leachates in throughflow. Herb leaves, total fine roots, and vascular stems accumulated some N-15 label in one or both of the freezing treatments by the end of the experiment. Together, these results indicating very small N losses relative to the magnitudes of internal transfers, suggest tight ecosystem N cycling both during and after freeze-thaw events. Furthermore, our small and subtle effects on microbial and soluble C and N pools relative to previous studies using more severe regimes, suggests that periods of moderate freeze-thaw fluctuations may have only a minor influence on the annual pattern of C and nutrient dynamics in seasonally cold ecosystems.

High densities of N. capensis were found in the shallow coastal waters (< 200 m), with the biomass of adults ranging from 675 to 5 706 mg dry wt m-2. For adult E. hanseni, the biomass was an order of magnitude lower, ranging from 65 to 505 mg dry wt m-2, with most specimens occurring over the shelf break at depths of 200 to 1000 m. These distribution patterns remained relatively constant throughout the year, despite seasonal differences in upwelling events. Both species displayed continuous breeding, with 43 to 82% of the adult female E. hanseni being fertilized, while a much lower proportion of N. capensis females were reproductively active (0.5 to 26%). Different breeding strategies were adopted by these two euphausiid species, with E. hanseni producing frequent broods (14.8 broods in 6 mo) consisting of relatively large eggs which are released into the sea, and N. capensis exhibiting a lower frequency of spawning, with broods consisting of large numbers of relatively small eggs, protected by a brood pouch. These strategies enable both species to maintain high densities throughout the year in a fluctuating physical environment. Growth rate estimated from size-frequency distributions were 0.003 to 0.063 mm d-1 for N. capensis and 0.077 to 0.083 mm d-1 for E. hanseni, suggesting an adult life-span of approximately 6 mo for both species. Maximum sizes were attained in September, with N. capensis reaching a total length of 21 mm (in contrast to all previous studies on N. capensis, where the maximum size recorded was only 13 mm total length) and E. hanseni a total length of 33 mm.","UNIV CAPE TOWN,MARINE BIOL RES INST,DEPT ZOOL,RONDEBOSCH 7700,SOUTH AFRICA","University of Cape Town","BARANGE, M (corresponding author), INST CIENCIAS MAR,PASEO NACL S-N,E-08039 BARCELONA,SPAIN.","","Barange, Manuel/D-2689-2016","Barange, Manuel/0000-0002-1508-0483","","","",NA,"45","29","31","0","3","SPRINGER VERLAG","NEW YORK","175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010","0025-3162","","","MAR BIOL","Mar.

The position of the Cambay basin (Gujarat), being closer to the equator during the Early Eocene period, makes it pertinent to understand the variations in petrographic and geochemical constituents of Gujarat and Rajasthan lignites in space and time. Floral growth, which largely depends on the climate of the region and its geographical location, has an important role in the formation of mire. Nevertheless, the peat forming plant communities, nutrient supply, bacterial activity, types of deposition, temperature, pH and redox potential impart various characteristics to coal and are reflected in macerals. Black bands, in Gujarat and Rajasthan lignites, are strongly gelified compared to brownish bands and are stratified in nature. They are dominantly composed of huminite maceral group, while liptinites and inertinites occur in subordinated amount. These lignites of Gujarat and Rajasthan have high values of gelification index (GI) and low tissue preservation index (TPI), indicating thereby a continuous presence of wet condition in the basin and slow subsidence rate. However, due to fluctuating water level in the basins, few sections experienced relatively oxic episodes indicated by relatively high inertinite content. Study of the ground water index (GWI) and vegetation index (VI) of these lignites indicates rheotrophic to mesotrophic hydrological condition. The study revealed that the lignites of Rajasthan and Gujarat were formed during the transgressive phase under coastal marshy setting. However, there were intermittent episodes of fluvial activities which gave rise to supratidal flood plains.","[Singh, Vijay K.; Rajak, Pramod K.; Singh, Prakash K.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Coal & Organ Petr Lab, Ctr Adv Study Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India","Banaras Hindu University (BHU)","Singh, PK (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Coal & Organ Petr Lab, Ctr Adv Study Geol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.","prakashbhu@rediffmail.com","Singh, Prakash K/AAE-6396-2020","Singh, Prakash K/0000-0003-1404-0997","","","",NA,"128","9","9","1","7","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","1367-9120","1878-5786","","J ASIAN EARTH SCI","J.

While mechanistic models are capable of predicting photosynthesis under fluctuating environmental conditions, simplifying the parameterization procedure is important toward a wide range of model applications. In this study, the biochemical photosynthesis model of Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry (the FvCB model) and the stomatal conductance model of Ball, Woodrow and Berry which was revised by Leuning and Yin (the BWB-Leuning-Yin model) were parameterized for Lilium (L. auratum x speciosum Sorbonne) grown under different water and nitrogen conditions. Linear relationships were found between biochemical parameters of the FvCB model and leaf nitrogen content per unit leaf area (N-a), and between mesophyll conductance and Na under different water and nitrogen conditions. By incorporating these N-a-dependent linear relationships, the FvCB model was able to predict the net photosynthetic rate (An) in response to all water and nitrogen conditions. In contrast, stomatal conductance (g(s)) can be accurately predicted if parameters in the BWB-Leuning-Yin model were adjusted specifically to water conditions; otherwise gs was underestimated by 9% under well-watered conditions and was overestimated by 13% under water-deficit conditions. However, the 13% overestimation of gs under water-deficit conditions led to only 9% overestimation of An by the coupled FvCB and BWB-Leuning-Yin model whereas the 9% underestimation of gs under well-watered conditions affected little the prediction of An. Our results indicate that to accurately predict An and gs under different water and nitrogen conditions, only a few parameters in the BWB-Leuning-Yin model need to be adjusted according to water conditions whereas all other parameters are either conservative or can be adjusted according to their linear relationships with N-a. Our study exemplifies a simplified procedure of parameterizing the coupled FvCB and gs model that is widely used for various modeling purposes.","[Zhang, Ningyi; Li, Gang; Yu, Shanxiang; An, Dongsheng; Sun, Qian; Luo, Weihong] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ningyi; Yin, Xinyou] Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Plant Sci, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Zhang, Ningyi] Wageningen Univ & Res Ctr, Dept Plant Sci, Hort & Prod Physiol Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands","Nanjing Agricultural University; Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research","Luo, WH (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Agr, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Yin, XY (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Dept Plant Sci, Ctr Crop Syst Anal, Wageningen, Netherlands.","lwh@njau.edu.cn; xinyou.yin@wur.nl","zhang, ningyi/AAW-7285-2020","Yin, Xinyou/0000-0001-8273-8022","China Natural Science Foundation [31171453]; China Scholarship Council","China Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council)","This research was funded by China Natural Science Foundation (31171453), and was conducted in the framework of collaboration between the College of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University and the Centre for Crop Systems Analysis, Wageningen University & Research.

The seasonal variations of the biochemical composition were related to several ecological variables (water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, water transparency, chlorophyll a concentration and D. magna biomass). The chitin content was positively correlated to the water temperature as a result of the strong influence of this later variable on the moulting rate of the daphnids and, subsequently, on the chitin synthesis by these organisms. The carotenoid content was positively correlated to the water transparency as a result of their photoprotective role in daphnids. The fluctuations of the lipid, protein and ash levels in D. magna depended to the food availability. Despite a seasonal variation in the biochemical composition, D. magna appeared to have adequate lipid and protein levels to be used in aquaculture. Its carotenoid content is similar to fish meals used to color salmonid flesh and these organisms could be used for this purpose. The prospect of using D. magna for chitin extraction is worth considering with respect to its significant chitin content, especially if highly valuable applications are aimed.","Univ Liege, Inst Zool, Lab Ecol Anim & Ecotoxicol, B-4020 Liege, Belgium; Univ Liege, Grp Rech Chitin Chitosan, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; Univ Liege, Inst Bot, Lab Algol Mycol & Systemat Expt, B-4000 Liege, Belgium","University of Liege; University of Liege; University of Liege","Cauchie, HM (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Inst Zool, Lab Ecol Anim & Ecotoxicol, Quai Van Beneden 22, B-4020 Liege, Belgium.","","Cauchie, Henry-Michel FV/K-8123-2014","Cauchie, Henry-Michel FV/0000-0003-4780-6100","","","",NA,"51","7","7","0","14","EDP SCIENCES S A","LES ULIS CEDEX A","17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE","0003-4088","2100-000X","","ANN LIMNOL-INT J LIM","Ann.

Photosynthetic efficiency of a crop canopy and productivity will depend significantly on how quickly a leaf can acclimate to a change. One measure of speed of response is the rate of photosynthesis increase toward its steady state on transition from low to high light. This rate was measured for seven genotypes of soybean [ Glycine max ( L.) Merr.]. After 10 min of illumination, cultivar `UA4805' ( UA) had achieved a leaf photosynthetic rate ( Pn) of 23.2 mu mol center dot m-2 center dot s-1, close to its steady- state rate, while the slowest cultivar `Tachinagaha' ( Tc) had only reached 13.0 mu mol center dot m - 2 center dot s - 1 and was still many minutes from obtaining steady state. This difference was further investigated by examining induction at a range of carbon dioxide concentrations. Applying a biochemical model of limitations to photosynthesis to the responses of Pn to intercellular CO2 concentration ( Ci), it was found that the speed of apparent in vivo activation of ribulose- 1: 5- bisphosphate carbo xylase/ oxygenase ( Rubisco) was responsible for this difference. Sequence analysis of the Rubisco activase gene revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms that could relate to this difference. The results show a potential route for selection of cultivars with increased photosynthetic efficiency in fluctuating light.","[Soleh, Mochamad Arief; Tanaka, Yu; Nomoto, Yuko; Iwahashi, Yu; Nakashima, Keiichiro; Fukuda, Yasuko; Shiraiwa, Tatsuhiko] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Soleh, Mochamad Arief] Padjadjaran State Univ, Fac Agr, Jalan Raya Bandung Sumedang Km 21, Jatinangor 45363, Indonesia; [Tanaka, Yu; Iwahashi, Yu; Long, Stephen P.] Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, 1206 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA","Kyoto University; Universitas Padjadjaran; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","Tanaka, Y (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Sakyo Ku, Kitashirakawa Oiwake Cho, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.;Tanaka, Y (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Inst Genom Biol, 1206 West Gregory Dr, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.","tanaka12@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp","Long, Stephen/AAA-1741-2019; Tanaka, Yu/GQH-6268-2022","Long, Stephen/0000-0002-8501-7164; Soleh, Mochamad/0000-0002-6905-7174; Tanaka, Yu/0000-0003-2106-4217","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Genomics-based Technology for Agricultural Improvement) [SFC1002]; DIKTI scholarship; realizing increased photosynthetic efficiency (RIPE) project","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Genomics-based Technology for Agricultural Improvement); DIKTI scholarship; realizing increased photosynthetic efficiency (RIPE) project","A part of this study was supported by a grant from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Genomics-based Technology for Agricultural Improvement, SFC1002), the DIKTI scholarship, and the realizing increased photosynthetic efficiency (RIPE) project.

We applied an extended dendrochronological approach to disentangle the functioning of drivers from the atmosphere (temperature, precipitation), the lithosphere (sedimentation rate), the hydrosphere (groundwater table, river water level fluctuation), the biosphere (tree characteristics), and the anthroposphere (dike construction). Carbon sequestration in aboveground biomass of riparian Quercus robur L and Fraxinus excelsior L was modeled (1) over time using boosted regression tree analysis (BRT) on cross-datable trees characterized by equal annual growth ring patterns and (2) across space using a subsequent classification and regression tree analysis (CART) on cross-datable and not cross-datable trees. While C sequestration of cross-datable Q robur responded to precipitation and temperature, cross-datable F. excelsior also responded to a low Danube river water level. However, CART revealed that C sequestration over time is governed by tree height and parameters that vary over space (magnitude of fluctuation in the groundwater table, vertical distance to mean river water level, and longitudinal distance to upstream end of the study area). Thus, a uniform response to climatic drivers of aboveground C sequestration in Q robur was only detectable in trees of an intermediate height class and in taller trees (>21.8 m) on sites where the groundwater table fluctuated little <= 0.9 m). The detection of climatic drivers and the river water level in F. excelsior depended on sites at lower altitudes above the mean river water level (<= 2.7 m) and along a less dynamic downstream section of the study area.

Traditional continuum damage mechanics (CDM) based creep-damage model are used extensively for the prediction and design against creep in these components. Conventional creep experiments show considerable uncertainty in the creep response of materials where scatter can span decades of creep life. The objective of this paper is to introduce the probabilistic methods into a deterministic creep-damage model in order to predict experimental uncertainty. In this study, a modified Wilshire model capable of creep deformation, damage, and rupture prediction is selected. Creep deformation data for 304 stainless steel is collected from the literature consisting of quintuplicate (five) tests at 600 degrees C with varying stress levels. It is hypothesized that the scatter in creep data is due to: test condition (temperature fluctuations and eccentric loading), initial damage (pre-existing surface and sub-surface defects), and metallurgical (local variation in microstructure) uncertainties. Probability distribution functions (pdfs) and Monte Carlo simulations are applied to introduce the uncertainties into the modified Wilshire equations. The domain of each source of uncertainty must be defined. A systematic calibration approach is followed where the material constant for each creep curve (in the quintuple) are obtained and statistical analysis is performed on the material properties to assess the random distribution associated with each uncertain material parameter. The probabilistic calibration begins with the introduction of test condition randomness (+/- 2 degrees C and +/- 3.2% MPa of nominal temperature/stress) in accordance with the ASTM standards. Cross calibration of temperature-stress variability proceeds the approximation of initial damage uncertainty which captures the remaining scatter in the data. Deterministic calibration unveils the range of variabilities associated with the material properties. The best-fitted pdfs are assigned to each uncertain parameter and subsequently, the deterministic model is converted into a probabilistic model where reliability is a tunable factor. A large number of Monte Carlo simulation are conducted to generate probabilistic creep deformation, minimum-creep-strain-rate (MCSR), and stress-rupture (SR) predictions. It is demonstrated that the probabilistic model produces quantitatively and qualitatively good fits when compared with experimental data. Future work will be directed towards the inclusion of service condition related uncertainty (power plant, turbine blade, Gen IV nuclear reactor application) into the probabilistic framework where the uncertainties are more robust.","[Hossain, Md Abir; Cano, Jaime A.; Stewart, Calvin M.] Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Mech Engn, El Paso, TX 79968 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso","Hossain, MA (corresponding author), Univ Texas El Paso, Dept Mech Engn, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.","","","","Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory [DE-FE0027581]; agency of the United States Government","Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); agency of the United States Government","This material is based upon work supported by the Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory under Award Number(s) DE-FE0027581.

The marine intertidal zone is considered among the most stressful of all marine environments, because daily exposure at low tide results in daily fluctuations in a range of important environmental factors. In this study we examined the link between daytime exposure and the performance of embryos, juveniles and adults of the seaweed Fucus gardneri across zones and seasons on San Juan Island, Washington, USA. Specifically we asked: ( 1) whether three measures of performance for F. gardneri: growth rates, surface area of reproductive tissue and survivorship differed between high- and mid-intertidal zones, and among months throughout the year and, then, ( 2) whether total daytime exposure within each zone each month was a good predictor of variation in these measures of performance. At our study site, seasonal differences in the timing of low tides result in long periods each day during summer of very harsh conditions ( exposure to the air, high temperatures and low humidity) compared to winter when exposure to the air during the day is virtually absent. Contrary to the expectation of lower performance in the high zone, we found no consistent differences between zones over the entire year in any measure of performance for any stage. For nearly all traits, there were significant differences among months and, importantly, significant interactions between zone and month. Thus, for each stage there were some months when thalli in the high zone performed better and some months when thalli in the mid-zone performed better. Regressions between total daytime exposure and performance each month indicated some stage-specific effects. Larger thalli appeared more strongly affected by the amount of exposure per month; there were significant negative relationships between total daytime exposure and ( 1) growth rates of medium and large adults in the high zone and ( 2) the surface area of reproductive tissue of medium adults in the high zone and small adults in the mid-zone. The lowest survivorship for all stages occurred in the 2 - 3 months that followed summer, suggesting a cumulative effect of long daytime exposure in summer on survivorship. Post-settlement survivorship of embryos was very low throughout the year, with only 2 out of 5395 seeded zygotes surviving to a visible size. One-month post-settlement survivorship ranged from 0% to 16.7%, and there were no differences in the survivorship curves between high- and mid-intertidal zones for each cohort. Although it is often assumed that the performance of intertidal species is lower in high- intertidal zones because of exposure to environmental extremes for longer, our results do not support this paradigm. Instead, they indicate a complex and fluctuating pattern of variation in the performance of different stages of the F. gardneri life-cycle throughout the year in different intertidal zones.","Bodega Bay Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA 94923 USA; Friday Harbor Labs, Friday Harbor, WA 98250 USA","","Wright, JT (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Inst Conservat Biol, Sydney, NSW 2522, Australia.","jeffw@uow.edu.au","Wright, Jeffrey/J-7536-2014","Wright, Jeffrey/0000-0002-1085-4582; Dethier, Megan/0000-0001-8900-0522","","","",NA,"52","32","32","0","35","SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0025-3162","1432-1793","","MAR BIOL","Mar.

In both species, there was a positive linear relationship between light-saturated theta (theta(max)) per unit leaf area and mean seasonal integrated daily quantum flux density (S(s), mol m(-2) day(-1)). Acclimation of leaf dry mass per area and nitrogen per area to growth irradiance largely accounted for this positive scaling. However, the slopes of the theta(max) versus S(s) relationships were greater on days when leaf temperature was high than on days when leaf temperature was low. Overall, theta(max) varied 2.5-fold across a temperature range of 20-30 degrees C. Maximum stomatal conductance (G(max)) also scaled positively with S(s). Although G(max) observed during daily time courses, and stomatal conductances during theta(max) measurements declined in response to seasonally decreasing soil water contents, theta(max) was insensitive to prolonged water stress, and was not strongly correlated with stomatal conductances during its estimation. These results suggest that photorespiration was an important electron sink when intercellular CO(2) concentration was low because of closed stomata. Given that xanthophyll cycle pool size (VAZ, sum of violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and zeaxanthin) may play an important role in dissipation of excess excitation energy, the response of VAZ to fluctuating light and temperature provided another possible explanation for the stable theta(max). Xanthophyll cycle carotenoids per total leaf chlorophyll (VAZ/Chl) scaled positively with integrated light and negatively with daily minimum air temperature, whereas the correlation between VAZ/Chl and irradiance was best with integrated light averaged over 3 days preceding foliar sampling. We conclude that the potential capacity for electron transport is determined by long-term acclimation of theta to certain canopy light conditions, and that the rapid adjustment of the capacity for excitation energy dissipation plays a significant part in the stabilization of this potential capacity. Sustained high capacity of photosynthetic electron transport during stress periods provides an explanation for the instantaneous response of theta to short-term weather fluctuations, but also indicates that theta restricts potential carbon gain under conditions of water limitation less than does stomatal conductance.","Estonian Inst Ecol, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia; Agr Univ Norway, Dept Biol & Nat Conservat, N-1432 As, Norway; Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Norwegian University of Life Sciences; University of Bayreuth","Niinemets, U (corresponding author), Estonian Inst Ecol, Riia 181, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.","","Niinemets, Ülo/A-3816-2008; Han, Qingmin/C-6841-2008","Niinemets, Ülo/0000-0002-3078-2192; Han, Qingmin/0000-0001-6063-6068; Bilger, Wolfgang/0000-0001-7800-4210","","","",NA,"71","40","43","0","14","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0829-318X","","","TREE PHYSIOL","Tree Physiol.","NOV","1999","19","13","",NA,"",NA,"839","852","","","","","","14","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","244HA","10562401","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000083044700001","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Here we investigate the population response of C. finmarchicus to record warming in the GoM in 2012. Demographic data from two time series stations and a plankton survey conducted in early autumn 2012 show that C. finmarchicus did not produce an autumn generation as predicted, despite warm summer and overwintering temperatures. On the contrary, we observed high abundances of the overwintering stage CV in the western GoM and a new cohort in early spring 2013 likely originating from egg production during a winter phytoplankton bloom. This spring cohort was the most abundant ever recorded in the 8-year time series. To account for these observations, we hypothesize that production of females originating from the eastern GoM and Scotian Shelf, combined with growth of copepodid stages in the Maine Coastal Current and local egg production, are the primary sources of supply maintaining high abundances in Wilkinson Basin, the primary repository of C. finmarchicus in the western GoM. Predicting fluctuations in abundance or circumstances for disappearance of C. finmarchicus in the northwest Atlantic will need models that address the roles of local production and advection.","[Runge, Jeffrey A.; Thompson, Cameron R.

The spatial distribution and dynamic change in NPP are closely related to regional climate, vegetation growth and human activities. Studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of NPP and its influencing factors plays a vital role in understanding ecosystem carbon sink capacity. MethodsBased on MODIS-NPP data, meteorological data, and land use data from 2000 to 2020, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics and influencing factors of NPP in the middle reaches of the Yellow River (MRYR) by using unary linear regression analysis, third-order partial correlation analysis, and Sen+Mann-Kendall trend analysis. ResultsThe results showed that the annual average NPP of the MRYR was 319.24 gCm(-2)a(-1) with a spatially decreasing trend from the southern part to the northern part. From 2000 to 2020, the annual average NPP experienced a fluctuating upward trend at a rate of 2.83 gCm(-2)a(-1), and the area with a significant upward trend accounted for 87.68%. The NPP of different land use types differed greatly, in which forest had the greatest increase in NPP. Temperature had a negative correlation with NPP in most parts of the MRYR. Water vapor pressure promoted the accumulation of NPP in the northwestern MRYR. The areas with a positive correlation between NPP and water vapor pressure accounted for 87.6%, and 20.43% of the MRYR area passed the significance test of P< 0.05. ConclusionThe results of the study highlight the impact of climate factors and land-use changes on NPP and provide theoretical guidance for high-quality sustainable development in the MRYR.","[Xuan, Wenxi; Rao, Liangyi] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xuan, Wenxi; Rao, Liangyi] Key Lab State Forestry & Grassland Adm Soil & Wate, Beijing, Peoples R China","Beijing Forestry University","Rao, LY (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Rao, LY (corresponding author), Key Lab State Forestry & Grassland Adm Soil & Wate, Beijing, Peoples R China.","raoliangyi@bjfu.edu.cn","","","Beijing Nova Program [2006A22]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0504503]; Ministry of Water Resources Public Welfare Industry Research Project [201501045]","Beijing Nova Program(Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commission); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Ministry of Water Resources Public Welfare Industry Research Project","Funding This research was financially supported by the Beijing Nova Program (2006A22) ,the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0504503) and the Ministry of Water Resources Public Welfare Industry Research Project (201501045).",NA,"73","0","0","15","15","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-462X","","","FRONT PLANT SCI","Front.

As part of the Office of Naval Research sponsored Small-business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, WET Labs developed a commercially available bioluminescence sensor, evolved from the Multipurpose Bioluminescence Bathyphotometer third generation (MBBP-G3) technology developed at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). UBAT provides a scalable, reliable, and accurate measure of mechanically stimulated bioluminescence potential in units of photons l(-1) capable of measuring less than 1 m fine-scale vertical resolution. The objectives of this work are: 1) to highlight the importance of long-term bioluminescence measurements and show that bioluminescence, in conjunction with other inherent optical properties (IOPs) can provide a more complete picture of spatial and temporal variability of biogeochemical complexity of coastal and ocean ecosystems, and 2) to provide the potential user with general knowledge of the effect of biofouling on the measurement of bioluminescence and 3) to describe general maintenance and service requirements necessary to maintain bioluminescence data quality over long deployment periods. A commercial UBAT prototype built by WET Labs, Inc., has been deployed since 2007 on an autonomous profiling system located at the California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) research facility in Avila Beach, CA. The pier is an excellent test facility and is constructed of concrete and steel and extends over 1 km into San Luis Obispo Bay. The pier is 10 meters above the water where the depth of the water is 12-14 m. Sea water quality is high and provides a rich biota for research. This region is well known for its dynamic seasonal bioluminescence community which is composed of both bioluminescent zooplankton and phytoplankton species. Vertical profiles of bioluminescence were collected every half hour along with chlorophyll fluorescence, turbidity, beam-C, conductivity, temperature, and salinity measurements. Over the deployment period, intense blooms of bioluminescence were observed and at times bioluminescence was inversely correlated with chlorophyll fluorescence and turbidity. Thus, bioluminescence, in conjunction with other IOPs, can provide a more complete picture of spatial and temporal variability of biogeochemical complexity of coastal and ocean ecosystems, particularly for the response of the planktonic community to environmental fluctuations. By broadening the use of bioluminescence measurements the UBAT will significantly increase general understanding of the roles of bioluminescence in oceanic biodynamics. Long-term deployments necessary for ecosystem monitoring require frequent system maintenance to ensure high-quality data. Prior to leaving the factory, UBAT bioluminescence light detection system and flow rate are calibrated with NIST traceable standards. Over a deployment period, increased bio-fouling typically decreases the signal accuracy. To track changes in the quality of measured bioluminescence, a validation light source is provided with each UBAT that is powered and controlled by the UBAT. The effect of biofouling on the quality of measured bioluminescence and flow rate are compared for two UBATs deployed in coastal regions, under different deployment regimes. In Avila Beach, CA, UBAT is deployed on an autonomous profiler package that is maintained outside of the water and automatically rinsed with fresh water between profiles which reduces biological growth on the sensors and the effect of biofouling on the data quality. In Yaquina Bay, OR, UBAT is deployed at a WET Labs test facility and maintained in the water during a period of peak biological growth. Yaquina Bay is a small drowned river estuary draining a 658 square km watershed located along the central Oregon coast that is very productive and also has dynamic seasonal periods for biological growth. Design changes applied to the UBAT in Yaquina Bay, OR, compared to the earlier model at Avila Beach, CA are intended to reduce the effect of biofouling. The composition of the material used for the detection chamber walls is the primary difference between the UBATs. The detection chamber of the UBAT deployed in Avila Beach, CA is composed of virgin Teflon, whereas the UBAT deployed in Yaquina Bay, OR is molded polyurethane loaded with 20% titanium dioxide. We expect that the titanium dioxide has improved anti-biofouling properties. A secondary design change was to the light baffle at the sensor exhaust. The exhaust baffle of the UBAT deployed in Avila Beach, CA is more restricted whereas the exhaust baffle of the UBAT deployed in Yaquina Bay has a 3-turn helical baffled with a copper exhaust cover.

In this work we examined the physiological performances of the coccolithophore Gephyrocapsa oceanica that had been acclimated to 1000 paten CO2 for similar to 400 generations, and then exposed to multiple drivers, light intensity, light fluctuating frequency, temperature and UV radiation. Here, we show that increasing light intensity resulted in higher nonphotochemical quenching and the effective absorption cross-section of PSII. The effective photochemical efficiency (Fv'/Fm') decreased with increased levels of light, which was counterbalanced by fluctuating light regimes. The greenhouse condition acts synergistically with decreasing fluctuating light frequency to increase the Fv'/Fm' and photosynthetic carbon fixation rate. Our data suggest that the coccolithophorid would be more stressed with increased exposures to solar UV irradiances, though its photosynthetic carbon fixation could be enhanced under the greenhouse condition.","[Jin, Peng; Liu, Nana; Gao, Kunshan] Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Jin, Peng] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Gao, Kunshan] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao 266071, Shandong, Peoples R China","Xiamen University; Guangzhou University; Laoshan Laboratory","Gao, KS (corresponding author), Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361102, Fujian, Peoples R China.","ksgao@xmu.edu.cn","gao, kunshan/G-3374-2010; Jin, Peng/AAH-7858-2021","Gao, Kunshan/0000-0001-7365-6332","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41806141, 41720104005, 41721005, 41430967, U1606404]; National Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [U1606404]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province","This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41806141, 41720104005, 41721005, 41430967) and joint project of National Natural Science Foundation of China and Shandong Province (No. U1606404).",NA,"65","5","6","7","36","PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND","0025-326X","1879-3363","","MAR POLLUT BULL","Mar.

Field and laboratory investigations were combined in a 2-year study on the initiation of a midsummer decline of Daphnia galeata Sars in a hypertrophic reservoir. Quantitative field samples were taken twice a week, and, adult and juvenile mortality rates were calculated. Patterns of reproduction and survival of daphnids born during spring and early summer under fluctuating food conditions were determined in life-table experiments. 2. The abundance of Daphnia increased strongly in early May and declined in June 1998 (midsummer decline). In 1999, Daphnia density increased only slowly in spring and remained constantly high throughout the summer. 3. Food conditions (concentrations of POC<30 mu m) for daphnids deteriorated in both years in response to increasing Daphnia densities, resulting in a clear-water phase of about 4 weeks. When Daphnia abundance declined in 1998, POC<30 mu m concentrations increased greatly, whereas in 1999 food conditions improved only slightly and Secchi depth remained high. 4. Survival of daphnids in life-table experiments decreased greatly after food became rare and was strongly reduced in those animals born during the clear-water phase compared with those born later. In addition, age at first reproduction was retarded during the clear-water phase, resulting in very low population growth rates. Survivorship patterns in life-table experiments suggest a strong impact of non-consumptive mortality on Daphnia population dynamics. 5. Field data of mortality point to differences in mortality patterns between years, probably resulting from different predation impacts of juvenile fish. In both years, however, adult mortality contributed substantially to overall mortality at the end of the clear-water phase. As bottom-up effects on D. galeata were very similar in both years, the significance of non-consumptive mortality on the initiation of midsummer declines appears to depend largely on recruitment patterns before the clear-water phase. A high impact can be expected when Daphnia populations are dominated by a peak cohort of nearly identical age during the clear-water phase.","Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Hydrobiol, D-8027 Dresden, Germany","Technische Universitat Dresden","Hulsmann, S (corresponding author), Netherlands Inst Ecol, Ctr Limnol, POB 1299, NL-3600 BG Maarssen, Netherlands.","huelsmann@cl.nioo.knaw.nl","Hülsmann, Stephan/K-9146-2015; Hülsmann, Stephan/N-3889-2018","Hülsmann, Stephan/0000-0002-9569-7626; Hülsmann, Stephan/0000-0002-9569-7626","","","",NA,"51","28","30","0","10","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0046-5070","1365-2427","","FRESHWATER BIOL","Freshw.

Light availability to saplings was estimated by hemispherical photography. Photosynthetic induction was measured in the morning on leaves that had not yet experienced direct sunlight. In Dicorynia, the maximum net photosynthesis rate (A(max)) was similar between forest environments (ca 4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), whereas for the two other species, it was twice as high in gaps (ca 7.5) as in the understorey (ca 4.5). However, the time required to reach 90% of A(max) did not differ among species, and was short, 7-11 min. Biochemical induction was fast in leaves of Pourouma, as about 3 min were needed to reach 75% of maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax); the two other species needed 4-5 min. When induction continued after reaching 75% of V-cmax, stomatal conductance increased in Pourouma only (ca 80%), causing a further increase in its net photosynthesis rate. When fully induced leaves were shaded for 20 min, loss of induction was moderate in all species. However, gap saplings of Dicorynia had a rapid induction loss (ca 80%), which was mainly due to biochemical limitation as stomatal conductance decreased only slowly. When leaves were exposed to a series of lightflecks separated by short periods of low light, photosynthetic induction increased substantially and to a similar extent in all species. Although A(max), was much lower in old than in young leaves as measured in Dicorynia and Vouacapoua, variables of the dynamic response of photosynthesis to a change in light tended to be similar between young and old leaves. Old leaves, therefore, might remain important for whole-plant carbon gain, especially in understorey environments. The three shade-tolerant species show that, particularly in low light, they are capable of efficient sunfleck utilization.","Wageningen Univ, Silviculture & Forest Ecol Grp, Dept Environm Sci, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands; Univ Utrecht, Dept Plant Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, NL-3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands","Wageningen University & Research; Utrecht University","Rijkers, T (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ, Silviculture & Forest Ecol Grp, Dept Environm Sci, POB 342, NL-6700 AH Wageningen, Netherlands.","toon.rijkers@btbo.bosb.wau.nl","","","","","",NA,"41","37","47","0","17","SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0029-8549","1432-1939","","OECOLOGIA","Oecologia","NOV","2000","125","3","",NA,"",NA,"331","340","","10.1007/s004420000459","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420000459","","","10","Ecology","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Environmental Sciences & Ecology","376DJ","28547327","","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000165442700003","View Full Record in Web of Science"

However, our understanding of the corresponding C sequestration capacity and driving mechanisms associated with each individual phytoplankton taxonomic group is limited. Particularly in the hydrologically dynamic system with highly complex surface hydrological processes (floodplain lake systems). Through investigating seasonal monitoring data in a typical floodplain lake system and estimation of primary productivity of each phytoplankton taxonomic group individually using novel equations, this study proposed a phytoplankton C fixation model. Results showed that dominant phytoplankton communities had a higher gross carbon sequestration potential (CSP) (9.50 +/- 5.06 Gg C each stage) and gross primary productivity (GPP) (65.46 +/- 25.32 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), but a lower net CSP (-1.04 +/- 0.79 Gg C each stage) and net primary productivity (NPP) (-5.62 +/- 4.93 mg C m(-3) d(-1)) than rare phytoplankton communities in a floodplain lake system. Phytoplanktonic GPP was high (317.94 +/- 73.28 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during the rainy season and low (63.02 +/- 9.65 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during the dry season. However, their NPP reached the highest during the rising-water stage and the lowest during the receding-water stage. Findings also revealed that during the rainy season, high water levels (p = 0.56**) and temperatures (p = 0.37*) as well as strong solar radiation (p = 0.36*) will increase photosynthesis and accelerate metabolism and respiration of dominant phytoplankton communities, then affect primary productivity and CSP. Additionally, water level fluctuations drive changes in nutrients (p = -0.57*) and metals (p = -0.68*) concentrations, resulting in excessive nutrients and metals slowing down phytoplankton growth and reducing GPP. Compared with the static water lake system, the floodplain lake system with a lower net CSP became a heterotrophic C source.","[Jia, Junjie; Gao, Yang; Sun, Kun; Lu, Yao; Wang, Jing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jia, Junjie; Gao, Yang; Lu, Yao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Shi, Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geog & Limnol, State Key Lab Lake Sci & Environm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Nanjing Institute of Geography & Limnology, CAS","Gao, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.","gaoyang@igsnrr.ac.cn","GAO, Yang/HMO-8142-2023; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013","","National Nature Science Foundation of China [41922003, 31988102, 41871080]","National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors of this study would like to thank all anonymous re-viewers for their helpful remarks.

In 1994, two 60 m long, 2.8 m high snow fences, one in moist and the other in dry tundra, were erected at Toolik Lake, Alaska. OTCs paired with unwarmed plots, were placed along each experimental snow gradient and in control areas adjacent to the snowdrifts. After 8 years, the vegetation of the two sites, including that in control plots, had changed significantly. At both sites, the cover of shrubs, live vegetation, and litter, together with canopy height, had all increased, while lichen cover and diversity had decreased. At the moist site, bryophytes decreased in cover, while an increase in graminoids was almost entirely because of the response of the sedge Eriophorum vaginatum. These community changes were consistent with results found in studies of responses to warming and increased nutrient availability in the Arctic. However, during the time period of the experiment, summer temperature did not increase, but summer precipitation increased by 28%. The snow addition treatment affected species abundance, canopy height, and diversity, whereas the summer warming treatment had few measurable effects on vegetation. The interannual temperature fluctuation was considerably larger than the temperature increases within OTCs (< 2 degrees C), however. Snow addition also had a greater effect on microclimate by insulating vegetation from winter wind and temperature extremes, modifying winter soil temperatures, and increasing spring run-off. Most increases in shrub cover and canopy height occurred in the medium snow-depth zone (0.5-2 m) of the moist site, and the medium to deep snow-depth zone (2-3 m) of the dry site. At the moist tundra site, deciduous shrubs, particularly Betula nana, increased in cover, while evergreen shrubs decreased. These differential responses were likely because of the larger production to biomass ratio in deciduous shrubs, combined with their more flexible growth response under changing environmental conditions. At the dry site, where deciduous shrubs were a minor part of the vegetation, evergreen shrubs increased in both cover and canopy height. These changes in abundance of functional groups are expected to affect most ecological processes, particularly the rate of litter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and both soil carbon and nitrogen pools. Also, changes in canopy structure, associated with increases in shrub abundance, are expected to alter the summer energy balance by increasing net radiation and evapotranspiration, thus altering soil moisture regimes.","Univ Alaska, Sch Agr & Land Resource Management, Boreal Ecol Cooperat Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK 99705 USA; Univ Alaska, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99705 USA","University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks","Bret-Harte, MS (corresponding author), Univ Alaska, Sch Agr & Land Resource Management, Boreal Ecol Cooperat Res Unit, Fairbanks, AK 99705 USA.","Syndonia.BretHarte@uaf.edu","","","","","",NA,"95","262","277","8","303","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1354-1013","1365-2486","","GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL","Glob.

Setting three irrigation levels: the upper and lower limits of W1-W3 irrigation controls were 50% theta f and 90% theta f, 60% theta f and 90% theta f, and 70% theta f and 90% theta f, respectively, where theta f (field water holding capacity) = 23% cm3 cm-3. Three fertilization levels were treated: low fertilizer F1 (60% CK), medium fertilizer F2 (75% CK), and high fertilizer F3 (90% CK). A control treatment (CK) was set up, and the upper and lower limits of CK irrigation control were 80% theta f and 90% theta f, respectively. The fertilization amount was N-P2O5-K2O = 260-119-485 kg ha-1, with a total of 10 treatments. Through the dynamic monitoring and systematic analysis of sap flow rate (SFR) and water consumption process of grapevines for three consecutive years (2017-2019), the results show that during the entire growth period, the daily SFR of grapevines treated with different water and fertilizer showed a single peak or multi peak trend and an obvious seasonal variability. Compared with different water and fertilizer treatments, CK inhibited the peak value of sap flow, and the maximum decrease was by 21.80%. Under different irrigation and fertilization levels, SFR was positively correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and air temperature (Ta); and the influence of meteorological factors on SFR reached a significant level (P < 0.05). The degree of influence was PAR, VPD, and Ta, respectively. The three-year water consumption fluctuated in the range of 191.42-376.22 mm. The ratio of plant transpiration (Tr) to ET was 70.89-86.15%. The results reveal the transpiration and physiological process of protected fruit trees, and the water consumption characteristics under different water and fertilizer treatments. This is helpful in improving tree irrigation and fertilization models in different areas with similar environmental conditions.","[Fu, Shining; Wei, Xinguang; Wang, Tieliang; Bai, Yikui] Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Water Conservancy, 120 Dongling Rd, Shenyang 110866, Peoples R China","Shenyang Agricultural University","Wei, XG (corresponding author), Shenyang Agr Univ, Coll Water Conservancy, 120 Dongling Rd, Shenyang 110866, Peoples R China.","weixg_wi@163.com","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51709174]; Liaoning Provincial key Research and Develop- ment Plan [2018103007]; Natural Foundation Funding Program of Liaoning Province [2021 -MS -233]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Liaoning Provincial key Research and Develop- ment Plan; Natural Foundation Funding Program of Liaoning Province","The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51709174) , Liaoning Provincial key Research and Develop- ment Plan (No. 2018103007) , and Natural Foundation Funding Program of Liaoning Province (No. 2021 -MS -233) .

These stress factors are known to severely hinder culture growth and fermentation performance. Results: Grape marc was selected as an extreme environment to search for innately robust yeasts because of its limited nutrients, exposure to solar radiation, temperature fluctuations, weak acid and ethanol content. Forty newly isolated Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains gave high ethanol yields at 40 degrees C when inoculated in minimal media at high sugar concentrations of up to 200 g/l glucose. In addition, the isolates displayed distinct inhibitor tolerance in defined broth supplemented with increasing levels of single inhibitors or with a cocktail containing several inhibitory compounds. Both the fermentation ability and inhibitor resistance of these strains were greater than those of established industrial and commercial S. cerevisiae yeasts used as control strains in this study. Liquor from steam-pretreated sugarcane bagasse was used as a key selective condition during the isolation of robust yeasts for industrial ethanol production, thus simulating the industrial environment. The isolate Fm17 produced the highest ethanol concentration (43.4 g/l) from the hydrolysate, despite relatively high concentrations of weak acids, furans, and phenolics. This strain also exhibited a significantly greater conversion rate of inhibitory furaldehydes compared with the reference strain S. cerevisiae 27P. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a strain of S. cerevisiae able to produce an ethanol yield equal to 89% of theoretical maximum yield in the presence of high concentrations of inhibitors from sugarcane bagasse. Conclusions: This study showed that yeasts with high tolerance to multiple stress factors can be obtained from unconventional ecological niches. Grape marc appeared to be an unexplored and promising substrate for the isolation of S. cerevisiae strains showing enhanced inhibitor, temperature, and osmotic tolerance compared with established industrial strains. This integrated approach of selecting multiple resistant yeasts from a single source demonstrates the potential of obtaining yeasts that are able to withstand a number of fermentation-related stresses. The yeast strains isolated and selected in this study represent strong candidates for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic hydrolysates.","[Favaro, Lorenzo; Basaglia, Marina; Trento, Alberto; Casella, Sergio] Univ Padua, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Anim & Environm DAF, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy; [Van Rensburg, Eugene; Garcia-Aparicio, Maria] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Proc Engn, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Van Zyl, Willem H.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Microbiol, ZA-7602 Stellenbosch, South Africa","University of Padua; Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University","Basaglia, M (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Dept Agron Food Nat Resources Anim & Environm DAF, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy.","marina.basaglia@unipd.it","Casella, Sergio/AAS-9318-2021; del Prado García Aparicio, María/AAN-1000-2020","del Prado García Aparicio, María/0000-0001-5312-6561; van Rensburg, Eugene/0000-0003-1756-119X; Heber, Willem/0000-0001-8195-353X","University of Padova entitled 'Engineering Consolidated Bioprocessing yeasts for the one-step conversion of cellulosic substrates into bioethanol' [ZA11MO2]","University of Padova entitled 'Engineering Consolidated Bioprocessing yeasts for the one-step conversion of cellulosic substrates into bioethanol'","This work was partially supported by: the research project funded by the University of Padova entitled 'Engineering Consolidated Bioprocessing yeasts for the one-step conversion of cellulosic substrates into bioethanol'; the bilateral joint research project N.

On both days the CBL grew to a height of around 1000 m at midday after which little further growth was observed. This was despite high rates of sensible heat flux into the CBL from the predominantly coniferous vegetation below and was attributable to a high subsidence velocity. For all flights, marked discontinuities across the top of the CBL were observed for water vapor and CO2 concentrations with differences between the CBL and the free troposphere above being as high as 10 mmol mol(-1) and 13 mu mol mol(-1), respectively. Associated with the lower CO2 concentrations within the CBL was an enrichment of the delta C-13 in CO2 of up to 0.7 parts per thousand. Although for any one flight, fluctuations in CO2 and delta C-13 within the CBL were small (less than 3 mu mol mol(-1) and 0.1 parts per thousand); they were well correlated and suggested a photosynthetic discrimination, Delta, by the vegetation below of similar to 17 parts per thousand. Estimates of regional Delta based on CBL budgeting techniques suggested values ranging from 14.8 to 20.4 parts per thousand. CBL budgeting techniques were also used to estimate regional ecosystem carbon fluxes (-3 to -9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and evaporation rates (1-3 mmol m(-2) s(-1)). Agreement with ground-based tower measurements was reasonable, but a bootstrap error analysis suggested that errors associated with the integral CBL technique were sometimes unacceptably large, especially for estimates of regional photosynthetic C-13 discrimination and regional evaporation rates. Conditions under which CBL techniques should result in reasonably accurate estimations of regional fluxes and isotopic fractionations are evaluated.","Australian Natl Univ, Environm Biol Grp, Res Sch Biol Sci, Inst Adv Studies, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; CSIRO, Div Land Air & Water, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; Univ Tuscia, Dept Forest Environm & Resources, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; CSIRO, Div Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia; Russian Acad Sci, Sukachevs Lab, Inst Evolut & Ecol Problems, Moscow, Russia; Manaaki Whenua Landcare Res, Lincoln, New Zealand; Univ Bayreuth, Dept Plant Ecol, Bayreuth, Germany","Australian National University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Tuscia University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Russian Academy of Sciences; Landcare Research - New Zealand; University of Bayreuth","Lloyd, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Postfach 10 01 64, D-07701 Jena, Germany.","jlloyd@bgc-jena.mpg.de; roger.francey@dar.csiro.au; danilo.mollicone@jrc.it; mike.raupach@cbr.clw.csiro.au; sogachev@bgc-jena.mpg.de; aarneth@bgc-jena.mpg.de; byersj@landcare.cri.nz; kelliherf@landcare.cri.nz; crebmann@bgc-jena.mpg.de; rik@unitus.it; wong@rsbs.anu.edu.au; gbauer@oeb.harvard.edu; dschulze@bgc-jena.mpg.de","Sogachev, Andrey/AAX-8249-2020; Francey, Roger J/A-2345-2012; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/K-9627-2014; Rebmann, Corinna/R-2359-2019; Rebmann, Corinna/E-5666-2011; Arneth, Almut/B-2702-2013; Lloyd, Jonathan J/F-8893-2010; Valentini, Riccardo/D-1226-2010","Sogachev, Andrey/0000-0001-6683-695X; Schulze, Ernst-Detlef/0000-0001-6188-9219; Rebmann, Corinna/0000-0002-8665-0375; Arneth, Almut/0000-0001-6616-0822; Lloyd, Jonathan J/0000-0002-5458-9960; Valentini, Riccardo/0000-0002-6756-5634","","","",NA,"51","67","69","0","11","AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","WASHINGTON","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","0886-6236","1944-9224","","GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEM CY","Glob.

Lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) growers seeking an alternative and/or a complement to supplemental irrigation require accurate crop-specific information on the water conserving benefits of mulch. Twenty-eight weighing lysimeters equipped with soil moisture monitors were used at five sites throughout the Downeast Region of Maine to compare water budgets of lowbush blueberry grown on un-mulched and mulched soils. Despite occurrence of the second wettest growing season in 60 years, April through September mean hourly soil water potential values at all sites indicated significantly (p < 0.001) drier conditions in un-mulched compared with mulched soils. Differences in soil water potential values between un-mulched and mulched soils were much more pronounced during three dry periods, totaling approximately 53 days, than during the 2009 growing season as a whole. Over the course of one 27 day dry-period, soil water potential values of un-mulched soils at two lysimeter stations indicated a need for irrigation more than 60% of the time, compared with 7-10% of the time for mulched soils. Mulching was found to reduce diurnal fluctuations of both soil water potential and volumetric water content. Early morning water deposition was significantly reduced by mulching at nearly all lysimeter stations; however, mulch-associated reductions in peak-hour evapotranspiration losses more than compensated for lower water inputs from dew and fog. During the three major periods of dry conditions, mulch reduced the evapotranspiration rate by an average of 0.045 +/- 0.003 cm/day at three crop-rotation fields and 0.039 +/- 0.027 cm/day at four prune-rotation fields. The greater variability in evapotranspiration rate reduction found among prune-rotation fields was considered due to differences in pruned shoot emergence from the mulch. These results indicate that mulching represents a viable method for alleviating drought-induced water stress for lowbush blueberry in Maine.","[Hunt, J.

At high mid-day VPD, transpiration rates can lead to a decline in leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)) if leaf hydraulic conductance (K-leaf) is insufficient to supply water to intercellular airspaces in pace with demand. K-leaf is determined by leaf xylem conductivity to water, as well as extra-xylem pathways that are likely mediated by aquaporin water transport proteins. When transpiration demand exceeds the maximum capacity of K-leaf to supply water, high tension in the water column can cause cavitation in xylem, and these emboli-blocked xylem vessels reduce water transport and thus lower K-leaf. Stomatal conductance typically remains high at mid-day for soybean, suggesting either a mid-day increase in K-leaf or that photosynthesis may be maintained at the cost of leaf water status, indicative of an anisohydric water management strategy in soybean. This study examined diurnal fluctuations in K-leaf and Psi(leaf), showing a mid-day depression in K-leaf in a pattern closely reflecting that of Psi(leaf), indicating that K-leaf depression is the result of cavitation in leaf xylem. The diurnal depression of K-leaf was not prevented by growth at elevated [CO2], which lowered stomatal conductance. Diurnal transcription patterns of aquaporin genes showed that a total of 34 genes belonging to 4 aquaporin families were expressed in soybean leaves, of which 22 were differentially expressed between at least two time points. These data suggest that mid-day K-leaf depression was driven primarily by cavitation at increasing xylem water tensions, but that aquaporins are also likely involved in diurnal regulation of soybean leaf water status. It is further concluded that because soybean photosynthesis is typically sustained at mid-day, K-leaf even at the depressed level was in excess of that needed to sustain a stomatal conductance sufficient to prevent depression of photosynthesis in soybean.

Council Directive 98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes lays down minimum standards for the protection of animals, including fish. The Scientific Opinion on welfare of carp was adopted on 22 October 2008. The common carp (Cyprinus carpio, Linnaeus 1758), which is by far the species farmed in largest numbers, is the scope of this opinion. Common carp is a domesticated species that has well adapted to the husbandry systems within which it is reared. In Europe, only two major production systems (monoculture of carp and polyculture of carp) are commonly practised. There are numerous combinations of polyculture with common carp production. Since the species involved are all cyprinids and occupy only slightly different ecological niches in the pond system, they were subjected to the same risk and hazard assessments as carp in monoculture. Consequently, for the purpose of risk assessment, polyculture was considered as an intensive monoculture production system. The various life stages of carp considered are: fertilised eggs and embryos, yolk sac fry, free swimming fry, nursed fry, fingerling, overwintering carp, on-growers, marketable fish, and broodstock. A review of environmental conditions and factors that were identified as possibly affecting the welfare of common carp, Cyprinus carpio, at different life stages has been conducted. These factors are grouped as: abiotic and biotic factors (including behavioural interactions), food and feeding, husbandry and management, genetics, and the impact of disease and disease control measures. It is however important to realise that the environmental conditions are always defined by a range of inter-related factors. While each specific variable is described separately, there are very few occasions in reality where only a single factor is involved in any fish welfare issue relating to environmental conditions. For this reason, only ranges of acceptable levels for the various factors can be given and these should always be considered in the context of the other variables involved. A semi-quantitative risk assessment was carried out to obtain a ranking of risk for different life stages under different production systems. Light levels applied to embryos should be kept low to avoid over-stimulation leading to exhaustion of endogenous reserves. The anatomy of carp may render them particularly vulnerable to excessive noise and vibration. There are no water flow requirements under carp farming conditions (except for eggs). Cessation of water flow helps hatching. Excessive water flows may cause crowding of fry and wasted use of energy reserves leading to starvation. Too low water flow was found in the risk assessment to be a more highly ranked hazard (causing hypoxia) in early life stages. Carp are remarkably tolerant to low oxygen levels, except in the first few months of the life cycle when fry are more sensitive. Occasionaly severe oxygen depletion associated with collapse of algal blooms in late summer at high temperatures can affect welfare. However, the results of the risk assessment found low oxygen to be the most important or second most important hazard for all life stages. Fry is a life stage particularly sensitive to low but also high O-2 levels. The risk assessment scoring found low oxygen to be an important cause of mortality at all life stages; but low oxygen levels are most important in the early stages. Eggs exposed to levels of gas supersaturation can lead to long term effects on surviving individuals. Supersaturation of dissolved gases may lead to gas bubble formation inside the larvae causing disruption of swimming activity. Carp can survive across a wide temperature range by adjustment of their level of activity. Carp larvae are very susceptible to temperature fluctuations: excessively high temperatures lead to increased rates of body deformities. Rapid temperature changes rather than absolute limits are normally a significant welfare issue for carp fry. Rapid temperature change was found in the risk assessment to be an important hazard for yolk and nursed fry and fingerlings. During incubation high water pH can lead to incomplete embryonic development and deformities and was found in the risk assessment to be an important hazard. Carp larvae are particularly sensitive to acid stress. In later life stages, water pH per se has little importance in carp husbandry, it is only important in terms of its influence on other abiotic hazards (e.g. ammonia) should they be present. Carp are not affected by suspended solid levels except at the very high concentrations that may occur during harvesting. High suspended solids can suffocate eggs and embryos (it was the third highest ranked hazard for this life stage) and the water supply to the hatchery water should be filtered to limit suspended solid and predatory invertebrates. Unionised ammonia can be a serious welfare issue under conditions of intensive photosynthesis such as following collapse of algal blooms. This was reflected in the risk assessment tables where unionised ammonia was highly ranked in nearly all life stages. A great care and understanding is required in levels of fertiliser in ponds to avoid this hazard. In the present culture systems in Europe, overwintering ponds do not present a particular welfare risk, compared with other life stages, although it is important that these overwintering ponds are sufficiently deep for the coldest weather. Catch pits in harvest ponds should be carefully designed to minimise the suspended solids problems. For larvae, bad design of the tank would prevent the swim bladder filling with air resulting in incomplete development of the swim bladder, impaired swimming ability, poor health and slow growth rates. Unless ponds are managed carefully, anoxic layers producing toxic metabolites can develop. Algal blooms can be a significant welfare risk because of their effect on pH, because the algae may themselves be toxic, and because the collapse of algal blooms may cause severe and acute anoxia. The results of the risk assessment indicated that algal blooms were most important during the on-growing stage. Predation is a very serious welfare issue particularly significant in the farm pond environment where cormorants in particular can induce significant stress to the fish manifested by behavioural modifications and associated reduction in feeding, and the birds may also inflict injury. Whilst carp generally feed on natural feed, above certain densities they should receive supplementation with a correctly balanced feed for a fish that already feed on natural feed. Stocking fry into ponds with insufficient supplies of suitable food will result in low survival rates, poor growth and significant deformities. Food supply is the main factor governing appropriate stocking density. This was reflected in the risk assessment results: a shortage of natural food was the highest ranked hazard for the free and nursed fry stage. Disease is one of the major welfare issues in all fish husbandry. In the case of carp it is particularly related to environment. Most carp pathogens are facultative pathogens present in the environment. Those diseases with chronic, often sub-clinical effects are often of greatest welfare significance. In more acute conditions, control or treatment measures may have significant welfare impact in their own right. Good husbandry should be the major means of disease control. Currently very few of the treatments which are effective can be used due to the fact that they are not licensed. The risk assessment scored three selected diseases. These hazards affected mainly the earlier life stages (fry) and their importance varied between production systems.","","","","","Pfeiffer, Dirk U/C-5002-2009; Blokhuis, Harry/A-6023-2013","Pfeiffer, Dirk U/0000-0001-7000-0530; Blokhuis, Harry/0000-0003-3608-6355","","","",NA,"1","1","1","2","6","EUROPEAN FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY-EFSA","PARMA","EUROPEAN FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY-EFSA, PARMA, 00000, ITALY","1831-4732","","","EFSA J","EFSA J.","DEC","2008","6","12","",NA,"",NA,"","","","10.2903/j.efsa.2008.843","http://dx.doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2008.843","","","28","Food Science & Technology","Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI)","Food Science & Technology","V9F0B",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000422251600013","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Various quantity of litter inputs was studied in a Quercetum-petraeae-cerris forest in northeastern Hungary at the Sikfokut DIRT (Detritus Input and Removal Treatment) experimental site. The goal of the project was to assess how rates and sources of plant litter inputs might control the accumulation and dynamics of organic matter and nutrients in forest soils over decadal time scales. Six treatments were applied at the experimental site. Beside the control (CO) condition, two detritus addition (double litter (DL) and double wood (DW)) and three detritus removal (no litter (NL), no roots (NR) and no input (NI) treatments were applied in which detritus quantities were manipulated above and below ground. Our aim was the study of the relationship between the litter treatments, their carbon (C) content and the number of microorganisms and biomass of fungi. Litter treatments also had a significant effect on soil microorganisms and soil organic carbon (SOC) content. These effects decreased in parallel with soil depth. Fungal biomass values were more than five times higher for DL (2 mg fungi g(-1) soil) than for the soils of NI (0.4 mg fungi g(-1) soil) condition in the upper 5 cm layer, while 0.57 (DL) and 0.08 (NI) values were measured in the 15-25 cm layer. The most probable number (MPN) method, which measures the number of certain groups of living and active microorganisms (fungi and bacteria), showed even greater differences between the treatments. Positive direct and indirect effects of greater organic matter inputs is affected the soil functioning through on better moisture and C content in soils. Litter entering the forest floor resulted in a larger amount of organic substrate and inorganic nutrients. In addition, it resulted in more favorable microclimatic conditions (lower temperature and soil moisture fluctuation) in the soils, which increased the number of microorganisms and the biomass of fungi. There is no significant difference in the number of microbes between the control and doubling treatments (DL, DW). Furthermore, in the case of fungal biomass, there is a significant difference only in the upper 5 cm layer of the DL. These results explain the significantly higher SOC content of the DL treatment compared to the other treatments, suggesting a weaker priming effect.

The performance of four moss species (Didymodon constrictus, Eurhynchium hians, Polytrichum commune and Racomitrium japonicum) were assessed using three kinds of substrate: (a) a mixture of clay soil and compost, b) baked black soil and c) river sand for two years in Chiba, within the Tokyo region of Japan. The individual species were grown in monoculture in 4 cm depth of substrate in trays on a rooftop without supplemental irrigation using an onsite propagation method. Although all four species became dormant in conditions of high temperature and little rain, it was possible for all to establish and survive. R. japonicum showed the greatest coverage among the four species, reaching 70%-80% cover in the first four months. P. commune performed almost as well but took over a year to reach consistently high coverage. E. hians coverage fluctuated greatly in response to drought events. D. constrictus had low coverage overall but grew slightly more in the clay/compost soil; P. commune did poorly in sand substrate; R. japonicum and E. hians showed no consistent differences in how they were affected by substrate type. After two years only R. japonicum and P. commune had high enough coverage to consider further investigation. R. japonicum is already used in green roofing and wall applications. This study suggests that while some mosses show high performance across substrate types, others can be used on green roofs to achieve high cover, but only after determining a suitable substrate type. These results can inform moss species selection for green roofs in Japan, however, this methodology can be applied in other regions to establish moss green roofs. An onsite propagation method can be used to establish moss green roofs but further research is needed to identify means of increasing onsite growth rates for more species.","[Nagase, Ayako] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Global & Transdisciplinary Studies, 1-33 Yayoicho,Inage Ku, Chiba 2638522, Japan; [Katagiri, Tomoyuki] Kochi Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Biol Sci, 2-5-1 Akebono Cho, Kochi 7808520, Japan; [Katagiri, Tomoyuki] Hattori Bot Lab, Obi 6-1-26, Nichinan, Miyazaki 8892535, Japan; [Lundholm, Jeremy] St Marys Univ, Dept Biol, 923 Robie St, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada","Chiba University; Kochi University; Saint Marys University - Canada","Nagase, A (corresponding author), Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Global & Transdisciplinary Studies, 1-33 Yayoicho,Inage Ku, Chiba 2638522, Japan.","anagase@chiba-u.jp; tomoyuki-katagiri@kochi-u.ac.jp; jeremy.lundholm@smu.ca","","","JSPS; JSPS in Japan [S17100]","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); JSPS in Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)","The authors declare the following financial interests/personal re- lationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Jeremy Lundholm reports financial support was provided by JSPS.

Intact paired soil cores were collected at 2-month intervals from an S x P factorial experiment at 4 field sites on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales on 11 occasions. Soil samples were collected from each core and the cores placed in the glasshouse. Sulfur was applied to one core of each pair and basal nutrients applied to all cores which were then oversewn with white clover (Trifolium repens L. cv. Haifa). The extractable S in the soil was analysed using the following techniques: 0.1 mol Ca(H2PO4)(2)/L (MCPt); 0.1 mol Ca(H2PO4)(2)/L, treated with activated charcoal (MCPi); water (H2O); 0.25 mol KCl/L, heated at 40 degrees C for 3 h (KCl-40); 0.25 mol KCl/L, heated at 100 degrees C for 4 h (KCl-100); 0.5 mol NaHCO3/L (NaHCO3); and an acid digestion of the soil (total). Dry matter yield and S content of the pasture shoots were measured for each 2-month growth period. The relationship between the various soil S extraction techniques and the response of pasture to applied S varied over time and was influenced by the level of inorganic S present in the soil and the amount of organic S extracted. When the level of MCPi-extractable S ranged between 2 and 22 mu g S/g soil due to the application of fertiliser (summer 1987-88 and autumn 1988), or after a period of high mineralisation rates (spring 1988), the MCPi, MCP,, H2O and KCl-40 techniques had the highest correlation with the increase in S content of the pasture when S was applied. The higher correlation for the MCPi, H2O and KCl-40 techniques than the MCPi technique indicates that plants obtained some S from the organic S pool. In contrast, when the levels of MCPi-extractable S ranged between 2 and 10 mu g S/g soil and the rate of mineralisation increased in response to an increase in soil temperature (June 1988 and June 1989) or moisture (September 1989) upon transfer of samples from the field to the glasshouse, the MCPi, H2O and KCl-40 techniques underestimated the available S pool and had lower r(2) values than either the KCl-100 or NaHCO3 techniques.","Univ New England, Div Agron & Soil Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia","University of New England","Anderson, GC (corresponding author), CSIRO, Private Bag PO, Wembly, WA 6014, Australia.","g.anderson@ccmar.csiro.au","","","","","",NA,"28","5","5","0","11","CSIRO PUBLISHING","CLAYTON","UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA","0816-1089","1836-5787","","AUST J EXP AGR","Aust.

The objectives of this study were to determine the specific effects of leaf position and age on water status measurements of excised leaves and assess the potential relevance to sampling in a large-scale breeding program. Initial water content (IWC) (kg H2O kg-1 dry wt.) at the time of excision and rate of water loss (RWL) (g H2O kg-1 dry wt. min-1) following stomatal closure were measured on leaves of four tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) genotypes grown in two controlled-environment experiments. Genotypic differences in RWL were more pronounced at early growth stages and were more consistent between experiments than were differences in IWC. The RWL of leaves 3, 4, and 5 of 'Hercules' and ICD1385 underwent considerable fluctuations during aging; the RWL for 'Pelissier' and ICD 2627 leaves were low and much more constant during leaf maturation. The flag leaves did not display the same fluctuations in RWL as were evident in the earlier leaves. Higher specific leaf weights (SLW) of flag leaves were responsible for lower RWL values of flag leaves compared to earlier leaves. Genotypic differences and fluctuations of RWL associated with leaf aging could not be attributed to differences in SLW. Decreasing RWL associated with higher leaf insertion levels and changes in RWL associated with leaf aging may lead to misclassification of genotypes unless considerable care is exercised during sample selection. It is suggested that RWL may be influenced by reversible changes in the leaf surface associated with aging.","UPC,IRTA,AREA CULTIVOS EXTENS,E-25006 LERIDA,SPAIN","IRTA; Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya","MCCAIG, TN (corresponding author), AGR CANADA,RES STN,RES BRANCH,SWIFT CURRENT S9H 3X2,SASKATCHEWAN,CANADA.","","Romagosa, Ignacio/A-8701-2011","Romagosa, Ignacio/0000-0001-6676-2196","","","",NA,"28","27","27","0","4","CROP SCIENCE SOC AMER","MADISON","677 S SEGOE ROAD, MADISON, WI 53711","0011-183X","","","CROP SCI","Crop Sci.","NOV-DEC","1991","31","6","",NA,"",NA,"1583","1588","","10.2135/cropsci1991.0011183X003100060041x","http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1991.0011183X003100060041x","","","6","Agronomy","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Agriculture","GU282",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1991GU28200041","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Total densities, population densities, and indices of assemblage structure were examined as response variables. A 90% reduction of total invertebrate densities at both sites suggested that assemblages had low resistance to spring and fall spates. Caenis, Leptophlebia, and Baetis mayflies were more resistant to spates than other common taxa. Recovery of total densities was slower after the fall spate relative to spring. This delay may reflect a reduced availability of colonists and low population growth rates due to lower temperatures. Invertebrate assemblage structure in both streams remained stable during the spring spate, either through resistance (intermittent stream) or resilience (perennial stream). Beyond a few weeks, the effects of the spring spate on assemblage structure was not evident in either stream. Long term assemblage stability was strongly influenced by the resistance and resilience of individual taxa, whose dominance was influenced by season and previous disturbance events. Periodic dewatering in the intermittent stream favored the establishment of spate-tolerant Caenis mayflies over other taxa, resulting in an assemblage highly resistant to spates. High resilience of perennial stream assemblages was associated with the rapid recovery of chironomids as the major taxon. Lower assemblage stability during the fall spate may be related to annual fluctuations in density and assemblage composition, and not necessarily to the spate itself. Summer drying affected intermittent riffle assemblage structure during flow periods by restricting the establishment of flow-dependent taxa, truncating the recovery of invertebrate densities after the spring spate, and favoring drought-tolerant taxa. Recolonization after drying was rapid and 21 taxa were collected 4 d after rewetting. Spates greatly reduced total densities; however, long term assemblage stability was maintained in both streams by individual taxa that were either highly resistant to disturbance (intermittent) or resilient (perennial).","UNIV OKLAHOMA, BIOL STN, KINGSTON, OK 73439 USA","University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman","","","","","","","",NA,"63","109","114","0","44","NORTH AMER BENTHOLOGICAL SOC","LAWRENCE","1041 NEW HAMSPHIRE STREET, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA","0887-3593","","","J N AM BENTHOL SOC","J.

Photosynthetic parameters were related to leaf nutrient and carbohydrate status to reveal controls of carbon uptake rate. In ail species, elevated CO2 depressed both the maximum Rubisco catalytic activity (V-c,V-max, by 19-44%) and maximum electron transport rate (J(max) by 13-39%), indicating significant photosynthetic acclimation of both measures. Even so, all species had increased maximum light-saturated rate of net CO2 uptake (A(max)) at the elevated growth CO2 level, due to higher intercellular CO2 concentration (c(i)). Leaf nitrogen concentration was central to photosynthetic performance, correlating with A(max), V-c,V-max and J(max). V-c,V-max and J(max) were linearly cc-correlated, revealing a relatively invariable J(max):V-c,V-max ratio, probably due to N resource optimization between light harvesting (RuBP regeneration) and carboxylation. Leaf total non-structural carbohydrate concentration (primarily starch) increased in high CO2, and was correlated with the reduction in V-c,V-max and J(max). Apparent feedback control of V-c,V-max and J(max) was thus surprisingly consistent across all species, and may regulate carbon exchange in response to end-product fluctuation. If so, elevated CO2 may have emulated an excess end-product condition, triggering both V-c,V-max and J(max) down-regulation. In Leucadendron, a general physiological mechanism seems to control excess carbohydrate formation, and photosynthetic responsiveness to elevated CO2, independently of genotype and nutrient concentration. This mechanism may underlie photosynthetic acclimation to source:sink imbalances resulting from such diverse conditions as elevated CO2, low sink strength, low carbohydrate export, and nutrient limitation.","Natl Bot Res Inst, ZA-7735 Cape Town, South Africa; Univ Natal, Dept Biol, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa","University of Kwazulu Natal","Midgley, GF (corresponding author), Natl Bot Res Inst, Post Bag X7, ZA-7735 Cape Town, South Africa.","midgley@nbict.nbi.ac.za","Pammenter, Norman/E-9357-2010; Midgley, Guy F./H-3585-2014","Midgley, Guy F./0000-0001-8264-0869","","","",NA,"54","25","27","0","13","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0022-0957","","","J EXP BOT","J.

The abundance index, alpha and beta diversity indices were used to analyse the characteristics of liverwort communities in the Monkey-Ear Sinkhole (280 m deep, entrance diameter 300 m, width 280 m). A Generalised Linear Model was used to study the vertical distribution of liverwort communities, and the relationships between their vertical distribution and environmental factors were analysed with Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Forty-two liverwort taxa from 22 genera in 19 families were identified in the sinkhole. The liverwort assemblages were dominated by the families Plagiochilaceae and Lejeuneaceae. The alpha and beta diversity appeared to fluctuate randomly among the four depths sampled. The highest degree of environmental heterogeneity was found at the lower-middle section of the sinkhole; liverwort community diversity at the base was much higher than that found at the upper, middle or lower-middle sections. The environment at the base of the sinkhole was more complex than at the other three depths, providing a range of habitats that facilitated the coexistence of multiple liverwort communities. The abundance of species, genera and families in liverwort communities followed the sequence: base > upper section > middle section > lower - middle section. There were significant differences in liverwort communities at the four depths. In the sinkhole, liverwort communities fell into three distribution groups: wide, moderate or narrow distribution along the vertical direction. The communities with a broad distribution, found from the upper section to the base, were affected by a combination of light, humidity and temperature, and were classified asmixed factor dependent; those with a moderate distribution found mostly in the mid and lower-middle sections were primarily dependent on temperature and humidity, and were classified astemperature and humidity dependent; and those with a narrow distribution found at the base of the sinkhole were mainly influenced by humidity, and were classified ashumidity dependent.","[Li, Chengyi; Zhang, Zhaohui; Li, Xiaofang; Wu, Jin] Guizhou Normal Univ, Key Lab Informat Syst Mt Area & Protect Ecol Envi, Guiyang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhihui] Guizhou Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guiyang, Peoples R China","Guizhou Normal University; Guizhou Normal University","Zhang, ZH (corresponding author), Guizhou Normal Univ, Key Lab Informat Syst Mt Area & Protect Ecol Envi, Guiyang, Peoples R China.","zhaozhang9@hotmail.com","wang, zhihui/HSF-6639-2023","","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31760050, 31760043, 31360043, 31360035]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 31760050, No. 31760043, No. 31360043 and No. 31360035].",NA,"63","1","3","1","16","TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0022-2933","1464-5262","","J NAT HIST","J.

A rolling nationwide survey was conducted four times between 1979 and 1998. Each complete survey required approximately 5 years. In the tea gardens (n = 191), the proportion of strongly acidified soils (pH < 4) increased from 31% (1979-1983) to 69% (1994-1998). Large C inputs mainly resulted from trimmed branches in the spaces between the hedges. The concentration of C in the topsoils increased significantly, regardless of the initial soil C concentration, in the strongly acidic soils when mineral fertilizers containing nitrogen (N) were added at rates of 0.6 to 0.9 Mg ha(-1) N. The soil C concentration increased by 2.0, 2.2, and 2.5 g kg(-1) yr(-1) at the non-Andosol sites with 'low pH' (soil pH was <4 over time), 'decreasing pH' (soils had a pH >4 at the beginning of the survey but a pH <4 at the end of the survey), and 'fluctuating pH' (soils had a pH that fluctuated above and below pH 4 over time), respectively. Soil C increased by 1.9 and 2.2 g kg(-1) yr(-1) at Andosol sites with 'decreasing pH' and 'fluctuating pH,' respectively. In contrast, in the orchards (n = 787) where the soil pH was adjusted to maximize plant growth, the long-term changes in soil C varied depending on the initial soil C concentrations. The initial topsoil C concentrations differed depending on the soil type and soil temperature. The soil C concentration increased by 0.2-0.3 g kg(-1) yr(-1) in the non-Andosol sites where the initial soil C level was low, but this increase was not significant. However, the soil C concentrations did not change at the Andosol sites where the initial soil C concentrations were high. The application of OAs did not differ significantly among the sites and did not vary significantly with time (with a few exceptions). Strongly acidic tea soils can potentially sequester large quantities of applied C, mainly from trimmed branches. Thus, tea soils are important for alleviating greenhouse gas emissions from tea gardens where large amounts of nitrous oxide have been emitted. Moreover, orchard soils with low initial soil C concentrations have the potential to increase soil C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, efficient use of renewable energy resources is one challenge, as they are influenced by fluctuating environmental conditions. Consequently, suitable energy storage and conversion techniques are required. The conversion of electricity to hydrogen as an energy carrier (Power-to-Gas) might contribute to solving the issue. The produced hydrogen could be stored in porous formations in the underground and withdrawn at times of high energy demand. In addition, the concept of underground bio-methanation is arising, which uses the metabolism of subsurface bacteria to convert hydrogen with added carbon dioxide to methane. By using carbon dioxide captured from power plants or carbon-rich industries, a reduced carbon circle could be established. To investigate the potential of underground methanation, the current state of the art in terms of laboratory investigations and pilot tests is summarized in this article, and the microbial potential in the underground is demonstrated. Based on the findings, criteria for underground bio-methanation and its potential in a circular economy are concluded. Besides, the research projects related to hydrogen storage and the experience from town gas storage sites were analyzed, because some sites showed extensive microbial activity during storage operations. In addition to the literature review, simulation studies are considered. As the bio-methanation process itself was already studied over the years during the development of aboveground bio-reactors, the underground methanation is compared to engineered bio-methanation reactors. Until recently underground bio-methanation was only observed as a side-effect during hydrogen-rich gas storage operations, but may be interesting for the development of a designed underground bio-reactor system in porous underground structures. The advantage compared to the engineered bio-methanation reactors is its enormous reactor volume combined with a possibility for large-scale storage, which are both stated to be critical aspects in the Power-to-Gas process chain. Critical factors for the underground bio-methanation are the presence and growth of the microbial population, which are sensitive to the reservoir conditions. High salinity brine and high temperatures can reduce the metabolism of the methanogenic microorganisms and thereby the conversion of hydrogen to methane. The behavior and the population kinetics of methanogens in a two-phase saturated porous media are not yet fully understood. Therefore, no efficiency factor or methane production rates can be concluded currently. Nevertheless, experiments on a laboratory scale show a well-working conversion process in porous media. The potential of underground bio-methanation systems was estimated without clear efficiency factors, but based on the above findings.","[Strobel, G.; Hagemann, B.; Wirth, M.; Ganzer, L.] Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Subsurface Energy Syst, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany","TU Clausthal","Strobel, G (corresponding author), Tech Univ Clausthal, Inst Subsurface Energy Syst, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany.","gion.joel.strobel@tu-clausthal.de","","","","","",NA,"19","0","0","5","17","URBAN-VERLAG GMBH","HAMBURG","PO BOX 70 16 06, D-22016 HAMBURG, GERMANY","0342-5622","","","OIL GAS-EUR MAG","Oil Gas-Eur.

The Eurasian collared lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus) is a keystone species in the Arctic ecosystem. Earlier studies have indicated that past climatic fluctuations were important drivers of past population dynamics in this species. Results Here, we analysed 59 ancient and 54 modern mitogenomes from across Eurasia, along with one modern nuclear genome. Our results suggest population growth and genetic diversification during the early Late Pleistocene, implying that collared lemmings may have experienced a genetic bottleneck during the warm Eemian interglacial. Furthermore, we find multiple temporally structured mitogenome clades during the Late Pleistocene, consistent with earlier results suggesting a dynamic late glacial population history. Finally, we identify a population in northeastern Siberia that maintained genetic diversity and a constant population size at the end of the Pleistocene, suggesting suitable conditions for collared lemmings in this region during the increasing temperatures associated with the onset of the Holocene. Conclusions This study highlights an influence of past warming, in particular the Eemian interglacial, on the evolutionary history of the collared lemming, along with spatiotemporal population structuring throughout the Late Pleistocene.","[Lord, Edana; Marangoni, Aurelio; Dalen, Love] Ctr Palaeogenet, Svante Arrhenius Vag 20C, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lord, Edana; Dalen, Love] Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Lord, Edana; Marangoni, Aurelio; Dalen, Love] Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Bioinformat & Genet, Box 50007, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Baca, Mateusz; Popovic, Danijela] Univ Warsaw, Ctr New Technol, S Banacha 2C, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland; [Goropashnaya, Anna, V; Fedorov, Vadim B.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Stewart, John R.] Bournemouth Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Talbot Campus, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Knul, Monika, V] Univ Winchester, Dept Archaeol Anthropol & Geog, Winchester SO22 4NR, Hants, England; [Noiret, Pierre] Univ Liege, Serv Prehist, Pl 20 Aout 7, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Germonpre, Mietje; Jimenez, Elodie-Laure] Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, OD Earth & Hist Life, Vautierstr 29, Brussels, Belgium; [Jimenez, Elodie-Laure] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Geosci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Abramson, Natalia, I] Zool Inst RAS, Dept Mol Systemat, St Petersburg, Russia; [Vartanyan, Sergey] Russian Acad Sci NEISRI FEB RAS, Far East Branch, NA Shilo North East Interdisciplinary Sci Res In, Magadan 685000, Russia; [Prost, Stefan] Nat Hist Museum Vienna, Cent Res Labs, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Prost, Stefan] Univ Vienna, Dept Cognit Biol, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Prost, Stefan] Konrad Lorenz Inst Ethol, A-1160 Vienna, Austria; [Prost, Stefan] South African Natl Biodivers Inst, Natl Zool Garden, Pretoria, South Africa; [Smirnov, Nickolay G.; Kuzmina, Elena A.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Plant & Anim Ecol UB RAS, 202 8 Marta St, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia; [Olsen, Remi-Andre] Stockholm Univ, Dept Biochem & Biophys, Sci Life Lab SciLifeLab, Stockholm, Sweden","Swedish Museum of Natural History; Stockholm University; Swedish Museum of Natural History; University of Warsaw; University of Alaska System; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Bournemouth University; University of Winchester; University of Liege; Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences; University of Aberdeen; Russian Academy of Sciences; Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences; University of Vienna; South African National Biodiversity Institute; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Plant & Animal Ecology of the Russian Academy of Sciences; SciLifeLab; Stockholm University","Lord, E; Dalen, L (corresponding author), Ctr Palaeogenet, Svante Arrhenius Vag 20C, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Lord, E; Dalen, L (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Zool, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Lord, E; Dalen, L (corresponding author), Swedish Museum Nat Hist, Dept Bioinformat & Genet, Box 50007, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden.","edana.lord@zoologi.su.se; love.dalen@zoologi.su.se","Abramson, Natalia/E-8001-2017","Abramson, Natalia/0000-0001-7387-5455; Baca, Mateusz/0000-0003-2174-3914","Stockholm University; Formas [2018-01640]; Bolin Centre for Climate Research; Polish National Science Centre [2020/38/E/NZ8/00431]; Institutional Development Award from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH [P20GM103395]; Centre of Biomedical Research Excellence [P20GM130443]; NIH [P20GM103395]; Zoological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences [075-15-2021-1069]; Brain.be 2.0 ICHIE project [BELSPO B2/191/P2/ICHIE]","Stockholm University; Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Bolin Centre for Climate Research; Polish National Science Centre; Institutional Development Award from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH; Centre of Biomedical Research Excellence; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Zoological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences(Russian Academy of Sciences); Brain.be 2.0 ICHIE project","Open access funding provided by Stockholm University.

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as the most commonly used greenness index, can effectively evaluate vegetation health and spatial patterns. MODIS-NDVI (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-NDVI) data for Tibet from 2001 to 2020 were obtained and preprocessed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The Theil-Sen median method and Mann-Kendall test method were employed to investigate dynamic NDVI changes, and the Hurst exponent was used to predict future vegetation trends. In addition, the main drivers of NDVI changes were analyzed. The results indicated that (1) the vegetation NDVI in Tibet significantly increased from 2001 to 2020, and the annual average NDVI value fluctuated between 0.31 and 0.34 at an increase rate of 0.0007 year(-1); (2) the vegetation improvement area accounted for the largest share of the study area at 56.6%, followed by stable unchanged and degraded areas, with proportions of 27.5 and 15.9%, respectively. The overall variation coefficient of the NDVI in Tibet was low, with a mean value of 0.13; (3) The mean value of the Hurst exponent was 0.53, and the area of continuously improving regions accounted for 41.2% of the study area, indicating that the vegetation change trend was continuous in most areas; (4) The NDVI in Tibet indicated a high degree of spatial agglomeration. However, there existed obvious differences in the spatial distribution of NDVI aggregation areas, and the aggregation types mainly included the high-high and low-low types; and (5) Precipitation and population growth significantly contributed to vegetation cover improvement in western Tibet. In addition, the use of the GEE to obtain remote sensing data combined with time-series data analysis provides the potential to quickly obtain large-scale vegetation change trends.","[Jiang, Fugen; Deng, Muli; Long, Yi; Sun, Hua] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Res Ctr Forestry Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Fugen; Deng, Muli; Long, Yi; Sun, Hua] Key Lab Forestry Remote Sensing Based Big Data & E, Changsha, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Fugen; Deng, Muli; Long, Yi; Sun, Hua] Key Lab State Forestry Adm Forest Resources Manage, Changsha, Peoples R China","Central South University of Forestry & Technology","Sun, H (corresponding author), Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Res Ctr Forestry Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Changsha, Peoples R China.;Sun, H (corresponding author), Key Lab Forestry Remote Sensing Based Big Data & E, Changsha, Peoples R China.;Sun, H (corresponding author), Key Lab State Forestry Adm Forest Resources Manage, Changsha, Peoples R China.","sunhua@csuft.edu.cn","","Jiang, Fugen/0000-0002-1940-9952","","","",NA,"54","7","7","15","38","FRONTIERS MEDIA SA","LAUSANNE","AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND","1664-462X","","","FRONT PLANT SCI","Front.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the causal relationship between strengthening the total phosphorus (TP) concentration standard in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and river water quality in the Geum River watershed (Rep. of Korea). Data, including precipitation, streamflow, and water quality, were collected for 2005-2020 and temporally divided into before  and after  the event of strengthening standards (in 2012). Further, the data were spatially divided into influence sites (impact) affected by the event and control sites (control) unaffected by the event. A median difference test for a before/after and control/ impact (BACI) analysis and a causal impact analysis (CIA) based on a Bayesian structural time-series model were performed to evaluate the changes in water quality after the event. The BACI test showed that the TP concentration was reduced significantly (p-value < 0.05) at all impact sites after the event, whereas the difference was not significant at the control sites. In contrast, other water quality variables, except TP, showed different statistical significance depending on the site. The CIA was performed by controlling the rainfall, flow rate, suspended solids, water temperature, biochemical oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand as covariates, which were selected based on a directed acyclic graph and bi-variable correlation analysis. The CIA results showed that the TP concentration was reduced significantly (p-value < 0.05) at all impact sites, except for the control sites after the event, which is consistent with the BACI results. The causal impact of environmental management policies was previously difficult to evaluate by objectively targeting the natural systems because of the confounding bias. Our study demonstrated that strengthening the TP concentration standard from WWTPs majorly contributed to reducing TP in the receiving river, even when confounding factors, such as fluctuations in non-point source pollution loads caused by rainfall and runoff, were excluded. The statistical approaches used in this study can be valuable and practical methods for such evaluations if sufficient prior and posterior data and appropriate covariates are obtained.","[Kim, Sungjin; Chung, Sewoong] Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Cheongju 28644, South Korea","Chungbuk National University","Chung, SW (corresponding author), Chungbuk Natl Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Cheongju 28644, South Korea.","znssungjin2@naver.com; schung@chungbuk.ac.kr","","CHUNG, SEWOONG/0000-0002-8596-4970","Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Aquatic Ecosystem Conserva- tion Research Program - Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) [2021003030004]","Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Aquatic Ecosystem Conserva- tion Research Program - Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE)(Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI)Ministry of Environment (ME), Republic of Korea)","This work was supported by the Korea Environmental Industry & Technology Institute (KEITI) through the Aquatic Ecosystem Conserva- tion Research Program, funded by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) (Grant number 2021003030004) .

The current study examined CO2 exchange of three different herbaceous vegetation components distributed over montado landscapes and within the footprint of long-term landscape eddy covariance monitoring studies. Simultaneous measurements with eddy covariance at two sites and with manually operated chambers at multiple locations revealed that slow drainage of shallow basins, the onset of drying at higher sites and a high release Of CO2 below tree canopies significantly influenced the overall course of montado ecosystem gas exchange during the spring. Hyperbolic light response models were employed to up-scale and compare herbaceous gas exchange with landscape net ecosystem CO2 flux. The up-scaling demonstrates the importance of the herbaceous understory in determining annual carbon balance of the montado and suggests a relatively small additional CO2 uptake by the tree canopies and boles, i.e., by the aboveground tree compartment, during springtime. Annual flux totals obtained during the extremely dry year 2005 and a normal precipitation year 2006 for the oak woodland and a nearby grassland WE re essentially the same, indicating that both ecosystems similarly exploit available resources. Based on comparisons with additional temperate grasslands, we can visualize the montado herbaceous cover as a typical European grassland canopy, but where temperature fluctuations in winter control uptake, and where total production depends on springtime rainfall as it controls phenological events and eventually dieback of the vegetation. on the other hand, tree canopies remain active longer during late spring and early summer, modifying the montado response from that of grassland. Uncertainties in flux estimates via both chamber and eddy covariance methodologies currently prevent a full understanding of vegetation/atmosphere coupling, of the recycling Of CO2 between the understory communities and trees, and of relationships between exchange rates of individual components of the vegetation mosaic and overall carbon and water balances in montado landscapes.

Moss communities constitute much of the understory in Arctic vegetation, and as poikilohydric plants moss are highly sensitive to timing and duration of moisture levels. Here we investigate the role of moisture content on NDVI, red and near-infrared reflectance, and gross primary productivity (GPP) of two sphagnum and two pleurocarpus moss community types during two separate drying experiments. For both experiments, blocks of moss were collected near Imnavait Creek, Alaska, saturated to full water capacity, and then allowed to air dry before being re-saturated. Drying of blocks was conducted in a translucent outdoor tent during the first experiment and under indoor climate-controlled conditions during the second. Community NDVI (experiment 1 and 2), and GPP (experiment 2) were measured at regular intervals during the dry-down and after rewetting. In both experiments, moss NDVI sharply declined between 80% and 70% moisture content for sphagnum moss communities (NDVI change = -0.17 to -0.2), but less so for pleurocarpus moss communities (NDVI change = -0.06 to -0.12). Changes in NDVI were largely the result of increases in reflectance in red wavelengths. Peak GPP for all community types in the second experiment (1.31 to 2.08 mu mo] m(-2)s(-1)) occurred at 80% moisture content and declined significantly as moisture content decreased. Rates of GPP continued to decline below 80% moisture content until near zero as moss reached a steady weight (air dry) over a period of 84 h, while NDVI values declined slowly between 70% hydration and fully air dry. Re-saturation caused NDVI to increase in both sphagnum (NDVI change = + 0.18 to + 0.23) and pleurocarpus (NDVI change = + 0.10 to + 0.17) communities. Only sphagnum communities showed GPP resuming (0.824 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) after 24 h. The strong changes in NDVI and mismatch of moss NDVI values and GPP with moisture content fluctuations indicate that using NDVI as a proxy for productivity in Arctic vegetation communities may be problematic and underscores the need for quantification of moss community coverage, composition, and moisture content.","[May, Jeremy L.; Unger, Steven; Oberbauer, Steven F.] Florida Int Univ, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Parker, Thomas; Unger, Steven] Marine Biol Lab, Ecosyst Ctr, 7 MBL St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Parker, Thomas] Univ Stirling, Biol & Environm Sci, Sch Nat Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland","State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Marine Biological Laboratory - Woods Hole; University of Stirling","May, JL (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.","jmay010@fiu.edu","Parker, Thomas/GNP-1839-2022","","National Science Foundation [PLR-1432982, PLR-1417763, PLR-1417645]","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This work is based in part on support from National Science Foundation grants PLR-1432982, PLR-1417763, and PLR-1417645 for the support of this study.

This review uses examples from throughout the world to demonstrate the extent to which rocky shores have been, and are currently, affected by pollution (examples used are endocrine disrupters, oil, eutrophication), over-collection of living resources, introduced alien species, modification of coastal processes (coastal defences, siltation) and global change (climate, sea level). These impacts are put into the context of natural fluctuations in time and variability in space of both the environment and the organisms. The relative magnitudes of some anthropogenic disturbances differ between the industrialized, developed world and the developing world. For example, in developed, industrialized countries pollution based impacts should diminish over the next 25 years due to improved regulation and a reduction in older 'dirtier' heavy industry. Conversely, in many developing countries pollution will increase as a consequence of growth in the human population and industrialization. Except for large-scale disasters such as oil spills, pollution tends mainly to influence embayed coastlines. Chronic effects such as eutrophication can have broader-scale impacts over whole coastlines and elevated nutrient levels have also been implicated in a trend of increasing frequency of catastrophic kills due to harmful algal. Direct removal of living resources has had major effects on coastlines at both local and regional scales and is likely to increase over the next 25 years, especially in developing countries where rapidly expanding human populations will put further pressure on resources. Impacts from recreational activities are likely to increase with greater leisure time in wealthier regions of the world, and cheaper travel will spread these impacts to poorer regions. Invasions by alien species have increased in frequency during the last 20 years leading to some dramatic effects on native assemblages. Problems associated with alien species, especially pathogens, will continue to increase over the next few decades. The proportion of the coastline modified by artificial structures (breakwaters, seawalls, groynes) will increase because of coastal development and defences against sea-level rise and the greater frequency of storms. This will increase connectivity between areas of rocky habitat. Siltation will continue to increase due to urbanization of catchments and estuaries, and changes in agricultural practice. This may have considerable impacts at local and regional scales, favouring sediment tolerant organisms such as turf algae and anemones. In the future, greater frequency of environmental extremes is likely, including large-scale events such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Global change in temperature, sea-level rise and increases in the frequency of storms will affect rocky shores throughout the world, but this will occur over long time scales; over the next 25 years most of the responses by rocky shore communities will mostly be quite subtle. Thus rocky shores will be subject to increasing degradation over the next 25 years. They are, however, less vulnerable than many other aquatic habitats due to their hard substratum (rock), their relative lack of large biogenic structures and to their generally open nature. They are also remarkably resilient, and rec Their susceptibility to both terrestrial and marine disturbances does make them more vulnerable than sublittoral and offshore habitats. There are considerable gaps in knowledge, particularly of certain microhabitats such as crevices, boulders, sand-scoured areas and rock pools. These have been much less studied than more accessible assemblages on open, freely draining rock. More research is needed to establish the effects of increasing sediment loads, ultraviolet radiation and introduced species on rocky shore communities. Strategic and applied research programmes should integrate field experiments and carefully selected monitoring programmes to verify management regimes. Hindcasting from the palaeo-record would be valuable, to compare rates of predicted change with periods when change was rapid in the past. This information could, in principle, be used to help conserve rocky shores through networks of marine protected areas and a general reduction of environmental pollution.","Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England; Marine Biol Assoc United Kingdom Lab, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; Univ Plymouth, Sch Biol Sci, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; Univ Coll Dublin, Dept Zool, Dublin 4, Ireland","University of Southampton; Marine Biological Association United Kingdom; University of Plymouth; University College Dublin","Hawkins, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Sch Biol Sci, Div Biodivers & Ecol, Bassett Crescent E, Southampton SO16 7PX, Hants, England.","sjha@mba.ac.uk","Thompson, Richard C/J-8879-2014; Langhamer, Olivia/J-3425-2012","Thompson, Richard/0000-0003-2262-6621","","","",NA,"256","323","338","11","395","CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS","NEW YORK","32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA","0376-8929","1469-4387","","ENVIRON CONSERV","Environ.

The objective of the present work was to analyze the bearing behavior of almond trees at both the orchard level and the individual spur level over multiple years to explain this apparent paradox. The 10-year yield patterns of three almond cultivars grown at three different sites within California were analyzed for tendencies of alternate bearing at the orchard level. At the individual spur level, data on spur viability, and number of flowers and fruits per spur were collected on 2400 individually tagged spurs that were observed over 6 years to characterize bearing at that level. At the orchard level one cultivar (Nonpareil) did exhibit a tendency for alternate bearing at one site (Kern) but other cultivars and sites did not. The orchard and the individual trees in which the spur population study was conducted showed tendencies for alternate bearing but the spur population did not. Only a relatively small percentage of the total tagged spur population bore fruit in any given year and therefore while individual fruiting spurs exhibited a high level of non-bearing after fruiting the previous year the spurs that did produce fruit in any year generally did not constitute enough of the total spur population to exhibit alternate bearing at the whole population level. Our results suggest that annual bearing fluctuations in almond are probably mainly due to year-to-year variations of parameters affecting fruit set and that high rates of fruit set in a given year may involve a larger-than-normal percentage of a spur population in fruit bearing. This would limit the size of the spur population available for flowering in the subsequent year and could cause alternate year bearing. However, from historical records, this would appear to be the exception rather than a normal circumstance. Therefore, almond should not be considered to be a strictly alternate-bearing species.","[Lampinen, Bruce D.; Metcalf, Samuel; DeJong, Theodore M.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Tombesi, Sergio] Univ Perugia, Dipartimento Sci Agr & Ambientali, I-06100 Perugia, Italy","University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Perugia","Lampinen, BD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Plant Sci, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.","bdlampinen@ucdavis.edu","Tombesi, Sergio/AAP-7326-2020","Tombesi, Sergio/0000-0002-5126-0561","Almond Board of California; Chico State University, Delta College; Paramount Farming, Inc","Almond Board of California; Chico State University, Delta College; Paramount Farming, Inc","Research was supported by the Almond Board of California and in-kind support was provided by Chico State University, Delta College, and Paramount Farming, Inc.",NA,"57","22","22","0","24","OXFORD UNIV PRESS","OXFORD","GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND","0829-318X","1758-4469","","TREE PHYSIOL","Tree Physiol.","DEC","2011","31","12","",NA,"",NA,"1413","1421","","10.1093/treephys/tpr119","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpr119","","","9","Forestry","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Forestry","864NS","22158011","Bronze","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000298247500012","View Full Record in Web of Science"

Seeds lose viability over time, which manifests in poor crop establishment in the field. Hydrophilic polymer seed coating has been examined for better crop establishment and as a delivery system but has not been investigated as a means to maintain seed quality during storage. Hence, the present study was undertaken to investigate the use of hydrophilic polymer (Disco Clear) film coating as a tool for ensuring safe seed storage. Seed moisture kinetics under saturated atmospheric conditions revealed lower moisture adsorption and desorption pattern in hydrophilic polymer-coated seeds as compared to non-coated seeds. However, when exposed to freely available water, hydrophilic polymer facilitated faster and more controlled imbibition, which manifested in reduced mean germination time. Seeds coated with hydrophilic polymer maintained the quality over a longer storage period than non-coated seeds, irrespective of the packaging material and storage conditions. In polymer-coated seeds that were stored in paper bags under ambient room conditions, non-significant differences were observed for all the observed seed quality parameters for longer period thereby indicating its practical application as an alternative to storage under regulated environment. The presence of the hydrophilic polymer film coat acted as a physical barrier for absorption of moisture in the vapour phase and hence, under ambient conditions, the film coated seeds remained effectively protected from equilibration with fluctuating relative humidity, in a manner comparable with storage in moisture impervious containers. Considering this fact, we propose that the polymer film coat in itself acts as a micro-container for seed and thereby facilitates safe seed storage for an extended length of time.

This study proposes a method of quantifying and comparing performance resilience in response to a standard disturbance. In a side-by-side study we compare the treatment performance of four different configurations of wetlands and denitrifying bioreactors subjected to hydraulic shock loads of five times the standard inflow rate of primary treated sewage for five days. The systems consist of: horizontal-flow gravel-bed wetlands (HG); single pass vertical-flow sand or gravel media wetlands followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors (VS + C and VG + C respectively); and a recirculating anoxic attached-growth bioreactor and vertical sand media wetland followed by carbonaceous denitrifying bioreactors (R(A + VS)+C). Resilience was quantified for Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Five-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) and Total Nitrogen (TN) by time integration of Relative Disturbance in Performance relative to pre-shock loading performance (days equivalent Performance Reduction), and by the Recovery Time after shock loading ceased. The quantification method allowed an unbiased comparison of the four different systems. It highlighted important differences in the resilience for different removal mechanisms associated with the configuration of the wetlands/bioreactor systems. Relative Disturbances in Performance were expressed in comparison to percent daily removal under standard loading, and, for the different pollutants were equivalent to loss of between 0.08 and 2.51 days of removal capacity. Average Recovery Times ranged from zero to three days, with all systems exhibiting substantial recovery even during the five-day shock loading period. This study demonstrated that both the horizontal gravel wetland and the vertical flow wetland systems combined with carbonaceous bioreactors tested are generally resilient to shock loading of five times hydraulic and organic loading for periods of up to five days. Standard quantification of performance resilience to shock loadings or other perturbations has potential application across a wide range of technologies and research fields. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested that the surface ocean pH, by the year 2100, would drop by a further 0.3 and 0.4 pH units under RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 6.0 and 8.5 climate scenarios. The macroalgae communities that consisted of Sargassum thunbergii and naturally attached epibionts were exposed to fluctuations of ambient and manipulated pH (0.3-0.4 units below ambient pH). The production and respiration in S. thunbergii communities were calculated from dissolved oxygen time-series recorded with optical dissolved oxygen sensors. The pH, irradiance, and dissolved oxygen occurred in parallel with diurnal (day/night) patterns. According to net mesocosm production - photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) model, the saturation and compensation PAR, the mean maximum gross mesocosm production (GMP), and daily mesocosm respiration were higher in the CO2 enrichment, than in the ambient condition, while the mean of photosynthetic coefficient was similar. In conclusion, elevated CO2 stimulated oxygen production and consumption of S. thunbergii communities in the mesocosm. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the GMP of the S. thunbergii community to irradiance was reduced, and achieved maximum production rate at higher PAR. These positive responses to CO2 enrichment suggest that S. thunbergii communities may thrive in under high CO2 conditions.","[Punchai, Peeraporn] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries & Environm Sci, Nagasaki, Japan; [Ishimatsu, Atsushi; Nishihara, Gregory N.] Nagasaki Univ, Org Marine Sci & Technol, Nagasaki, Japan","Nagasaki University; Nagasaki University","Nishihara, GN (corresponding author), Nagasaki Univ, Org Marine Sci & Technol, Nagasaki, Japan.","greg@nagasaki-u.ac.jp","Nishihara, Gregory N/GNM-5370-2022","Nishihara, Gregory N/0000-0003-2543-1301","","","",NA,"42","2","2","0","39","WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1322-0829","1440-1835","","PHYCOL RES","Phycol.

For both carpet and drywall, the cycling of, RH between two different RH levels resulted in differences in the amounts and, compositions of the emission profiles compared to static RH conditions. For example, the total sum of emissions (Sigma VOCs) was 88% elevated in dynamic RH (12 h. 85%, 12, hr. 50%) conditions compared to static RH conditions (24 h. 85%) for carpets, with, nitrogen-containing emissions increasing from 0.0065 mg.hr-1.m-2 to 3.02 mg.hr-1.m-2. Emissions of some chemical identities, like C4H9ONH+ (putative morpholine), appeared to be activated by cycling RH with emissions going from 0 mg. hr-1.m-2 at, static RH to 15 mg.hr-1.m-2 and 150 mg.hr-1.m-2 at dynamic RH for carpet and, drywall, respectively. The addition of house dust decreased the Sigma VOCs from building, materials by 32-85%, except when RH conditions were sufficiently elevated to support, microbial growth. Many of the compounds observed in this study may be related to, material degradation processes. Overall, fluctuating RH changes the VOC emissions, profile from building materials at static RH by increasing emissions and emitting more, nitrogen-containing compounds, which could have important implications for human, chemical exposures.","[Hall, Emma C.; Misztal, Pawel K.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Ernest Cockrell Jr Hall,301 E Dean Keeton St, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Haines, Sarah R.] Ohio State Univ, Environm Sci Grad Program, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Haines, Sarah R.; Dannemiller, Karen C.] Ohio State Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Haines, Sarah R.; Dannemiller, Karen C.] Ohio State Univ, Div Environm Hlth Sci, Coll Publ Hlth, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Marciniak, Katarzyna] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Chem, Edinburgh EH9 3FJ, Midlothian, Scotland; [Goldstein, Allen H.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Adams, Rachel I.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Plant & Microbial Biol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Dannemiller, Karen C.] Ohio State Univ, Sustainabil Inst, Columbus, OH 43210 USA","University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Edinburgh; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University","Misztal, PK (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environm Engn, Ernest Cockrell Jr Hall,301 E Dean Keeton St, Austin, TX 78712 USA.","misztal@utexas.edu","Goldstein, Allen H/A-6857-2011; Misztal, Pawel K/B-8371-2009","Goldstein, Allen H/0000-0003-4014-4896; Misztal, Pawel K/0000-0003-1060-1750; Haines, Sarah/0000-0003-3791-6947; Hall, Emma/0000-0001-8904-3207","Alfred P.

Diurnal variation in leaf extension, translocation and allocation of assimilated C ((CO2)-C-14 pulse-labelling) and N (N-15 pulse and steady-state labelling) were also followed.

Ammonium and NO3- showed qualitatively similar diurnal patterns of net uptake, with minimum and maximum rates, respectively, at the start and end of the photoperiod; but NH4+ uptake showed a proportionately steeper decline during the dark period. This trend was mirrored by the decrease in translocation of N from roots to shoots during the dark, concurrent with an increase in the relative allocation of NH4+-N to expanding leaves and young tillers, and in NO3--N to older expanded leaves. Overall the apparent 'sink-strength' of expanding leaves for N declined during the dark period, Pulse-chases of (CO2)-C-14 fed to the youngest fully expanded leaf at the start and end of the photoperiod showed that translocation of C-14 to the roots continued throughout the dark period, but that the apparent rate was halved after 9 h of darkness.

More than 30% of the world's animal protein for human consumption comes from the sea, and in many countries, particularly the developing countries, this percentage is significantly higher. As a result, it is important to know how increased levels of exposure to solar UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) might affect the productivity of aquatic systems. In addition, the oceans play a key role with respect to global warming. Marine phytoplankton are a major sink for atmospheric carbon-dioxide, and they have a decisive role in the development of future trends of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. The relative importance of the net uptake of carbon dioxide by the biological pump in the ocean and by the terrestrial biosphere is a topic of much current research. Phytoplankton form the foundation on which the very survival of aquatic food webs depends. Marine phytoplankton are not uniformly distributed throughout the oceans of the world. The highest concentrations are found at high latitudes while, with the exception of upwelling areas on the continental shelves, the tropics and subtropics have 10 to 100 times lower concentrations. In addition to nutrients, temperature, salinity and light availability, the high levels of exposure to solar UV-B radiation that normally occur within the tropics and subtropics may play a role in phytoplankton distributions. A major loss in primary biomass productivity may have significant consequences for the intricate food web in aquatic ecosystems and affect food productivity. It has been estimated that a 16% ozone depletion could result in a 5% loss in phytoplankton, which equals a loss of about 7 million tons of fish per year. Biological effects of small changes in UV-B exposure may be difficult to determine because the biological uncertainties and variations are large, and the baseline productivity for pre-ozone-loss eras is not well established. Phytoplankton productivity is limited to the euphotic zone, the upper layer of the water column in which there is sufficient sunlight to support net productivity. The position of the organisms in the euphotic zone is influenced by the action of wind and waves. In addition, many phytoplankton are capable of active movements that enhance their productivity and, therefore, their survival. Like humans, phytoplankton cannot perceive, and thereby avoid, UV-B radiation. Exposure to solar UV-B radiation has been shown to affect both orientation mechanisms and motility in phytoplankton, resulting in reduced survival rates for these organisms. Researchers have directly measured the increase in, and penetration of, UV-B radiation in Antarctic waters, and have provided conclusive evidence of direct ozone-related effects within natural phytoplankton communities. Making use of the space and time variability of the UV-B front associated with the Antarctic ozone hole, researchers assessed phytoplankton productivity within the hole compared to that outside the hole. The results show a direct reduction in phytoplankton production due to ozone-related increases in UV-B. One study has indicated a 6-12% reduction in the marginal ice zone. In recent years, there has been increased interest in UV-B effects on macroalgae and seagrasses. In contrast to the phytoplankton, most macrophytes are attached to their growing site, thereby restricting them to specific growth areas and the resultant exposure to UV-B radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated that photosynthesis is inhibited in many red, brown, and green benthic algae. Solar UV-B radiation has been found to cause damage to early developmental stages of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians and other animals. The most severe effects are decreased reproductive capacity and impaired larval development. Even at current levels, solar UV-B radiation is a limiting factor, and small increases in UV-B exposure could result in significant reduction in the size of the population of consumer organisms. At high latitudes (over 40 degrees N) the late-spring increases in UV-B exposure may affect some species because the UV-B enhancement occurs at critical phases of their development. Even small increases or temporary fluctuations in UV-B may affect relatively sensitive species. Recent studies have addressed the potential impact of chlorofluorocarbon substitutes and their degradation products. Some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), notably HFC134a, HCFC123, and HCFC124, are degraded, generating trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as their main product. TFA is mildly toxic to most marine and freshwater phytoplankton. It is still speculative if TFA is concentrated in the food web. Even if produced well into the next century, TFA is unlikely to reach toxic levels for oceanic phytoplankton; however, it could reach toxic levels in restricted aquatic systems. Although there is overwhelming evidence that increased UV-B exposure is harmful to aquatic ecosystems, the potential damage can only be roughly estimated at the present time.","CONSORTIUM INT EARTH SCI INFORMAT NETWORK,WASHINGTON,DC 20006; BANARAS HINDU UNIV,CTR ADV STUDY BOT,VARANASI 221005,UTTAR PRADESH,INDIA; UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,CTR REMOTE SENSING & ENVIRONM OPT,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106","Columbia University; Banaras Hindu University (BHU); University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara","HADER, DP (corresponding author), UNIV ERLANGEN NURNBERG,INST BOT & PHARMAZEUT BIOL,STAUDTSTR 5,D-91058 ERLANGEN,GERMANY.","","","","","","",NA,"83","142","151","0","129","ROYAL SWEDISH ACAD SCIENCES","STOCKHOLM","PUBL DEPT BOX 50005, S-104 05 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN","0044-7447","","","AMBIO","Ambio","MAY","1995","24","3","",NA,"",NA,"174","180","","","","","","7","Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences","Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)","Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology","RB824",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:A1995RB82400005","View Full Record in Web of Science"

In order to cope with a daily changing environment, organisms have developed adaptive strategies by exhibiting daily behavioral and physiological changes. Biological rhythms are properties conserved in all the levels of organization, from unicellular to prokaryotes to upper plants and mammals. A biological rhythm is defined as the recurrence of a biological phenomenon in regular intervals of time. Biological rhythms in behaviour and physiology are controled by an internal clock which synchronizes its oscillations to external time cues that have the capacity to adjust the clock's mechanism and keep it coupled to external fluctuations. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus in mammals is the master circadian clock which is mainly entrained by the light-dark cycle. The SCN transmits time signals to the brain and then to the whole body and by means of its time signals the SCN keeps a temporal order in diverse oscillations of the body and adjusted to the light-dark cycle. The correct temporal order enables an individual to adequate functioning in harmony with the external cycles. Biological rhythms have a hereditary character, thus its expression is genetically determined. All animals, plants, and probably all organism show some type of physiological rhythmic variation (metabolic rate, production of heal, flowering, etc.) that allow for the adaptation to a rhythmic environment. Biological rhythms enable individuals to anticipate and to be prepared to the demands of the prominent cyclic environmental changes, which are necessary for survival. Also, biological rhythms promote showing maximum levels of a physiological variable at the right moment when the environment requires a maximal response. In humans, an example of circadian rhythms is the sleep-wake cycle; simultaneously, a series of physiological changes are exhibited, also with circadian characteristics (close to 24 hours). Circadian oscillations are observed in the liberation of luteinizant hormone, in plasma cortisol, leptin, insulin, glucose and growth hormone just to mentions some examples. The SCN controls circadian rhythmicity via projections to the autonomic system and by controlling the hypothalamus-adenohipofisis-adrenal axis. In this way, the SCN transmits phase and period to the peripheral oscillators to maintain an internal synchrony. Modern life favors situations that oppose the time signals in the environment and promote conflicting signals to the SCN and its effedors. The consequence is that circadian oscillators uncouple from the master clock and from the external cycles leading to oscillations out of synchrony with the environment, which is known as internal desynchronization. The consequence is that physiological variables reach their peak expression at wrong moments according to environmental demands leading then to deficient responses and to disease in the long run. Also, levels of attention, learning and memory reach peak expression at wrong moments of the day leading individuals to exhibit a deficient performance at school or work. The disturbed sleep patterns promote fatigue and irritability, which difficult social interaction. Internal desynchronization results from transmeridional traveling for which people pass multiple hourly regions. This results in an abrupt change in the time schedule and a syndrome known as jet lag,,. Frequent travelers complain about difficulties to adjust their sleepwake cycle to the new schedule, thus resulting in fatigue, increased sleepiness and reduced attention. Jet lag results from a loss of synchrony among biological rhythms and among diverse function's, which remain out of phase with the day-night cycle. This internal desynchronyn is the cause of general discomfort, decrement in the physical and mental performance, as well as irritability and depression. Frequently, gastrointestinal disorders are a by-product of food consumption at an unusual schedule. The state of internal desynchrony is transitory and depends on the number of time zones that were crossed; thus, adaptation to a new external cycle can take from four to seven days. Another example of internal desynchrony is observed in individuals exposed to work shifts or to nocturnal work schedules (night work). In such conditions, circadian fluctuations in behavioral, hormonal and metabolic parameters are observed but their temporary relation with the external cycles is modified. The internal synchrony is thus affected by troubled environmental signs, out of phase with the daily activities of the individual; among them are the hours of food intake, the exposure to light during resting hours, the low temperature of the night, and the forced activity when homeostatic processes indicate!a need to rest. This internal desynchrony leads to gastrointestinal disorders, disturbed metabolic fluctuations, disturbed cardiovascular functions, altered menstrual cycle, sleep disorders, sleepiness, increase of work accidents, etc. Internal desynchrony is especially due to the fact that circadian fluctuations are influenced by daily external cycles, but also by homeostatic factors, and can suffer from additional disturbance by sleep deprivation. Despite years of night work experience, incapacity to adapt to night work may persist. Only a minority of shift workers achieve spontaneous adjustment of the rhythms of core body temperature, melatonin, cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, or prolactin secretion to shifts by nocturnal work. Therefore shift and night workers develop a propensity to smoke, drink alcoholic beverages and use stimulant products. After five years of shift or night work, health problems appear with a higher incidence than in the general population. The growing social demand of shift work makes if necessary to decide on the characteristics and forms of shifts to carry out, and up to now organizing such working schedules remaing a serious problem. The improvement of health services has increased life expectancies and thus the general population is becoming old and people survive more years. Older people ail from health and behavioral problems including a deterioration of the biological rhythms. Main alterations consist of a loss of expression of the circadian functions or a decrease of the amplitude of the rhythms, and instability of synchronization mechanisms day by day. All in all, this implies a decreased capacity of the clock to adjust to the solar day. The decreased efficacy of the aging biological clock is evident in the fragmented sleep patterns and the disturbed sleep/wake rhythms, characterized by short sleep episodes during the day and decreased sleep during the night. Some studies suggest that the disturbed circadian rhythms may be the cause of diverse diseases associated with the elderly. In conclusion, during the last 100 years we have changed our lifestyle so radically that we lack already a physiological design to adapt so quickly to modernity. We can state that our body is designed for a world that does not exist. In this article we present a review of the main alterations of the biological rhythms generated by the transmeridional trips, shift-work and aging, their behavioral and physiological consequences that lead to disease and poor menial performance. We also discuss possible strategies that need to be explored and that may help people to improve their quality of life and to prevent internal desynchrony.","[Salgado Delgado, Roberto Carlos; Escobar Briones, Carolina] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med, Dept Anat, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Fuentes Pardo, Beatriz] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med, Dept Fisiol, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico","Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico","Delgado, RCS (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Med, Dept Anat, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.","robertosalgado@yahoo.com","Escobar, Carolina/AAX-2354-2020; Ho, Rainbow Tin Hung/A-8705-2012","Escobar, Carolina/0000-0002-2974-7875; Ho, Rainbow Tin Hung/0000-0002-6173-621X","","","",NA,"66","1","1","0","43","INST NAC PSIQUIATRIA RAMON FUENTE MUNIZ","MEXICO CITY","CALZ MEXICO-XOCHIMILCO #101, MEXICO CITY 22 DF, MEXICO","0185-3325","","","SALUD MENT","Salud Ment.","JAN-FEB","2009","32","1","",NA,"",NA,"69","76","","","","","","8","Psychiatry","Social Science Citation Index (SSCI)","Psychiatry","424CR",NA,"","","","2023-04-18","WOS:000264543600009","View Full Record in Web of Science"

A multi-decadal drought event some 850 years ago may have eliminated maize cultivation by the first human settlers of the Colorado Plateau, the Fremont and Anasazi people, and contributed to the abandonment of their settlements. Even today, ranching and farming are vulnerable to drought and struggle to persist. The recent use of the Colorado Plateau primarily as rangeland has made this region less tolerant to drought due to unprecedented levels of surface disturbances that destroy biological crusts, reduce soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, and increase rates of soil erosion. The most recent drought of 2002 demonstrated the vulnerability of the Colorado Plateau in its currently depleted state and the associated costs to the local economies. New climate predictions for the southwestern United States include the possibility of a long-term shift to warmer, more arid conditions, punctuated by megadroughts not seen since medieval times. It remains to be seen whether the present-day extractive industries, aided by external subsidies, can persist in a climate regime that apparently exceeded the adaptive capacities of the Colorado Plateau's prehistoric agriculturalists.","[Bowling, David R.; Ehleringer, James R.] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA","Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah","","","Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010; Schwinning, Susanne/G-6412-2015","Schwinning, Susanne/0000-0002-9740-0291","","","",NA,"89","61","63","0","8","RESILIENCE ALLIANCE","WOLFVILLE","ACADIA UNIV, BIOLOGY DEPT, WOLFVILLE, NS B0P 1X0, CANADA","1708-3087","","","ECOL SOC","Ecol.
