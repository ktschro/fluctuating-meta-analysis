Projections suggest that these trends are likely to continue in many regions, particularly in northern latitudes and in arid regions. Despite wide speculation that asymmetric warming has different impacts on plant and ecosystem production than equal-night-and-day warming, there has been little direct comparison of these scenarios. Reduced DTR has also been widely misinterpreted as a result of night-only warming, when in fact T-min occurs near dawn, indicating higher morning as well as night temperatures. We report on the first experiment to examine ecosystem-scale impacts of faster increases in T-min than in T-max, using precise temperature controls to create realistic diurnal temperature profiles with gradual day-night temperature transitions and elevated early morning as well as night temperatures. Studying a constructed grassland ecosystem containing species native to Oregon, USA, we found that the ecosystem lost more carbon at elevated than ambient temperatures, but remained unaffected by the 3 degrees C difference in DTR between symmetric warming (constantly ambient + 3.5 degrees C) and asymmetric warming (dawn T-min = ambient + 5 degrees C, afternoon T-max = ambient + 2 degrees C). Reducing DTR had no apparent effect on photosynthesis, probably because temperatures were most different in the morning and late afternoon when light was low. Respiration was also similar in both warming treatments, because respiration temperature sensitivity was not sufficient to respond to the limited temperature differences between asymmetric and symmetric warming. We concluded that changes in daily mean temperatures, rather than changes in T-min/T-max, were sufficient for predicting ecosystem carbon fluxes in this reconstructed Mediterranean grassland system.",,,,,"Phillips, Claire/AGP-5674-2022","Phillips, Claire/0000-0001-9072-6806",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,NOV,2011,17,11,,,,,3263,3273,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02483.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02483.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000296137000001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Wei, N; Zhou, LM; Dai, YJ",,,,"Wei, Nan; Zhou, Liming; Dai, Yongjiu",,,Evaluation of simulated climatological diurnal temperature range in CMIP5 models from the perspective of planetary boundary layer turbulent mixing,CLIMATE DYNAMICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"This study examines the effects of modeled planetary boundary layer (PBL) mixing on the simulated temperature diurnal cycle climatology over land in 20 CMIP5 models with AMIP simulations. When compared with observations, the magnitude of diurnal temperature range (DTR) is systematically underestimated over almost all land areas due to a widespread warm bias of daily minimum temperature (T-min) and mostly a cold bias of daily maximum temperature (T-max). Analyses of the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble means suggest that the biases of the simulated PBL mixing could very likely contribute to the temperature biases. For the regions with the cold bias in T-max, the daytime PBL mixing is generally underestimated. The consequent more dry air entrainment from the free atmosphere could help maintain the surface humidity gradient, and thus produce more surface evaporation and potentially lower the T-max. The opposite situation holds true for the regions with the warm bias of T-max. This mechanism could be particularly applicable to the regions with moderate and wet climate conditions where surface evaporation depends more on the surface humidity gradient, but less on the available soil moisture. For the widespread warm bias of T-min, the widely-recognized overestimated PBL mixing at nighttime should play a dominant role by transferring more heat from the atmosphere to the near-surface to warm the T-min. Further analyses using the high resolution CFMIP2 output also support the CMIP5 results about the connections of the biases between the simulated turbulent mixing and the temperature diurnal cycle. The large inter-model variations of the simulated temperature diurnal cycle primarily appear over the arid and semi-arid regions and boreal arctic regions where the model differences in the PBL turbulence mixing could make equally significant contributions to the inter-model variations of DTR, T-max and T-min compared to the model differences in surface radiative processes. These results highlight the importance and need for accurate descriptions of the PBL processes with respect to the turbulent mixing in order to improve the temperature diurnal cycle simulations in climate models.",,,,,"Zhou, Liming/A-2688-2012","Zhou, Liming/0000-0002-7009-2487",,,,,,,,,,,,,0930-7575,1432-0894,,,,JUL,2017,49,1-2,,,,,1,22,,10.1007/s00382-016-3323-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3323-0,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000403716500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Philip",,,Diurnal Temperature Range and Chikungunya Virus Infection in Invasive Mosquito Vectors,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Climate strongly influences the geographic distribution and timing of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. Environmental temperature affects phenotypic traits of mosquitoes including vector competence for arboviruses mediated by changes in infection, extrinsic incubation period and in rates of transmission. Most experiments, however, are done at constant temperatures. In nature, mosquitoes are more likely to experience daily fluctuations in temperature. Here we compare disseminated infection (leg infection) and saliva infection of Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) from Florida following oral exposure to an Asian genotype of chikungunya virus emergent in the Americas. We evaluated experimentally the effect of variable temperature regimens on disseminated infection and saliva infection of these Aedes species. Each of three temperature regimes had approximately the same average temperature (27-28 degrees C), but differed in the magnitude of the diurnal temperature range (DTR). The large DTR was 8.0 degrees C (range 23-31 degrees C) and the small DTR was 4.0 degrees C (range 26-30 degrees C) which approximate ranges in different locations of Florida during July-October when risk of transmission is highest. The constant temperature was set at 27 degrees C. Testing three geographic populations of each mosquito species, significant effects on disseminated infection were detected for an interaction between temperature regime and geographic population for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. There were no significant treatment effects of temperature, geographic population, or temperature by geographic population interaction on saliva infection for either mosquito species. Constant temperature resulted in a higher viral load in the saliva of Ae. albopictus, but not Ae. aegypti, compared to conditions where the temperature fluctuated.",,,,,"Zirbel Yanchula, Kylie/N-6835-2015","Zirbel Yanchula, Kylie/0000-0001-7673-2580",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-2585,1938-2928,,,,JAN,2018,55,1,,,,,217,224,,10.1093/jme/tjx182,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjx182,,,,,,,,29040730,,,,,WOS:000422975600023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Predictions of insect developmental rates using degree-days (thermal unit accumulations above the developmental base threshold of the insect) are based on daily mean temperatures, regardless of DTR. However, non-linearity and variance in the means and extremes are often ignored. The role of thermal variance (e. g., daily temperature extremes and DTR) was evaluated experimentally for two swallowtail butterfly sister species using a common day/night photoperiod of 18 : 6 h photo : scoto-phase and corresponding daytime thermophase and nighttime cryophase periods of 22 : 22 degrees C (constant 22 degrees C), 24 : 16 degrees C, and 26 : 10 degrees C (all three treatments had the same daily mean and the same degree-day accumulations). Although developmental rates of post-diapause pupae were largely unaffected for both species, our results show that sizes in P. canadensis females (but not males) were smaller in the treatments with more variance (26 degrees C : 10 degrees C) compared to constant 22 degrees C.

Any observed trend can result from natural variability or anthropogenic influences or both. In the present study, we evaluated the performance of 18 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 on simulating the Asian diurnal temperature range (DTR) and explored the potential causes of the long-term trend in the DTR by examining the response of the DTR to natural forcing (volcanic aerosols and solar variability) and anthropogenic forcing (anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) and aerosols) in the historical period of 1961-2005. For the climatology, the multimodel ensemble mean reproduced the geographical distribution and amplitude of the DTR over eastern China and India but underestimated the magnitudes of the DTR over the Tibetan Plateau and the high-latitude regions of the Asian continent. These negative biases in the DTR over frigid zones existed in most models. Seasonal biases in the DTR pattern from models were similar to the bias in the annual mean DTR pattern. Based on three selected state-of-the-art models, the observed decreasing trend in the DTR over Asia was reasonably reproduced in the all-forcing run. A comparison of separate forcing experiments revealed that anthropogenic forcing plays the dominant role in the declining trend in the DTR. Observations and model simulations showed that GHG forcing is mainly responsible for the negative trends in the DTR over Asia but that anthropogenic aerosol forcing was also behind the decreasing trend in the DTR over China and especially over eastern China.",,,,,"Li, Zhanqing/F-4424-2010; huang, gang/D-6427-2012; Gong, Hainan/R-2934-2019; Li, Chao/L-1915-2015","Li, Zhanqing/0000-0001-6737-382X; huang, gang/0000-0002-8692-7856; Gong, Hainan/0000-0002-6501-162X; Li, Chao/0000-0003-2556-0891",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-897X,2169-8996,,,,APR 16,2016,121,7,,,,,3519,3533,,10.1002/2015JD024549,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015JD024549,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000375120200028,View Full Record in Web of Science

A large diurnal temperature range (DTR) (approximate to 18 degrees C daily swing) extended immature development time (> 1 d), lowered larval survival (approximate to 6%), and reduced adult female reproductive output by 25% 14 d after blood feeding, relative to the constant 26 degrees C temperature. A small DTR (approximate to 8 degrees C daily swing) led to a negligible or slightly positive effect on the life history traits tested.

Diurnal temperature ranges were set at 5, 10 and 15 degrees C with the same daily mean temperature and accumulated growing degree days (GDDa), under a parabolic STP. Seasonal temperature patterns were set following parabolic, anti-parabolic and quasi-horizontal configurations with DIF set at 10 degrees C. The results showed that DIF or cultivar had a significant influence on the biomass, plant height (PH), stem diameter (SD), length of technical stem (LTS), weight of technical stem (WTS), fibre weight (FW), fibre content (FC) and seed weight per pot (SWp). Seasonal temperature pattern also had a significant influence on these traits except for WTS and FW. Significant interactions were observed between DIF and cultivar, affecting all traits with the exception of FW, and between STP and cultivar, affecting biomass, PH, SD and WTS. Diurnal temperature range set at 10 degrees C was optimal for biomass, PH, SD, LTS, WTS, and FW, while DIF set at 5 degrees C benefited FC and SWp. Among the different SIP configurations, anti-parabolic pattern was optimal for biomass, PH, SD, LTS and FC, and the quasi-horizontal pattern best fit SWp.

The latter could be important from a climate impacts perspective. We analyze daily mean, diurnal range and variability of surface air temperature in two continuous 3 1/2 year long climate simulations over the continental USA, one for present day conditions and one for conditions under doubled carbon dioxide concentration, conducted with a regional climate model (RegCM), on a 60 km grid, nested in a general circulation model (GCM). Model output is compared with a 30-year daily observational data set for various regions of the USA. In comparison with observations the diurnal range in the model control run is somewhat too low although the daily temperature mean is often well reproduced. The daily variability of temperature is underestimated by the model in all areas, but particularly when and where the observed variability is relatively high. Causes for these underestimations are traced to deficiencies in the general circulation of the driving GCM. With: doubled CO2, both maximum and minimum temperatures increase, but the change in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) varies spatially and seasonally. On an annual average over the land domain, the DTR decreases by 0.25 degrees C. Changes in DTR are most strongly correlated with changes in absorbed shortwave radiation at the surface, which explains 72% of the variance in DTR on an annual basis. Change in evaporation was factor affecting DTR only in the summer when it explained 52% of the variance. The most significant findings with CO2 doubling are substantial decreases in daily variability in winter over large portions of the domain, and localized increases in summer.

As the DTR is an effective proxy for cloud cover, this result supports the notion that widespread cloud changes may be induced by the CR flux. If confirmed, this would have significant implications for our understanding of natural climate forcings. Here, we perform a detailed investigation of the relationships between DTR and solar activity (total solar irradiance and the CR flux) from more than 60 years of NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and observations from meteorological station data. We find no statistically significant evidence to suggest that the DTR is connected to either long-term solar periodicities (11 or 1.68-year) or short-term (daily timescale) fluctuations in solar activity, and we attribute previous reports on the contrary to an incorrect estimation of the statistical significance of the data. If a CR-DTR relationship exists, based on the estimated noise in DTR composites during Forbush decrease (FD) events, the DTR response would need to be larger than 0.03 degrees C per 1% increase in the CR flux to be reliably detected. Compared with a much smaller rough estimate of -0.005 degrees C per 1% increase in the CR flux expected if previous claims that FD events cause reductions in the cloud cover are valid, we conclude it is not possible to detect a solar related responses in station-based or reanalysis-based DTR data sets related to a hypothesized CR-cloud link, as potential signals would be drowned in noise.",,,,,"Shahbaz, Tariq/Z-3108-2019; Calogovic, Jasa/AAG-6040-2019; Palle, Enric/AAE-4492-2019","Shahbaz, Tariq/0000-0003-1331-5442; Calogovic, Jasa/0000-0002-4066-726X; Laken, Benjamin/0000-0003-2021-6258; Palle, Enric/0000-0003-0987-1593",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-897X,,,,,SEP 25,2012,117,,,,,,,,D18112,10.1029/2012JD017683,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2012JD017683,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000309416800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, we investigated the impact of a wide range of varying soil-water temperature on biodegradation of toluene under aerobic conditions. To see the seasonal impact of temperature, three sets of batch experiments were conducted at three different constant temperatures: 10A degrees C, 21A degrees C, and 30A degrees C. These conditions were considered to represent (1) winter, (2) spring and/or autumn, and (3) summer seasons, respectively, at many polluted sites. Three additional sets of batch experiments were performed under fluctuating soil-water temperature cases (21 <> 10A degrees C, 30 <> 21A degrees C, and 10 <> 30A degrees C) to mimic the day-night temperature patterns expected during the year. The batches were put at two different temperatures alternatively to represent the day (high-temperature) and night (low-temperature) times. The results of constant- and fluctuating-temperature experiments show that toluene degradation is strongly dependent on soil-water temperature level. An almost two-fold increase in toluene degradation time was observed for every 10A degrees C decrease in temperature for constant-temperature cases. Under fluctuating-temperature conditions, toluene degraders were able to overcome the temperature stress and continued thriving during all considered weather scenarios. However, a slightly longer time was taken compared to the corresponding time at daily mean temperature conditions.

Most studies analyzing malaria-temperature relations, including those investigating malaria risk and the possible impacts of climate change, are based solely on mean temperatures and extrapolate from functions determined under unrealistic laboratory conditions. Here, we present empirical evidence to show that, in addition to mean temperatures, daily fluctuations in temperature affect parasite infection, the rate of parasite development, and the essential elements of mosquito biology that combine to determine malaria transmission intensity. In general, we find that, compared with rates at equivalent constant mean temperatures, temperature fluctuation around low mean temperatures acts to speed up rate processes, whereas fluctuation around high mean temperatures acts to slow processes down. At the extremes (conditions representative of the fringes of malaria transmission, where range expansions or contractions will occur), fluctuation makes transmission possible at lower mean temperatures than currently predicted and can potentially block transmission at higher mean temperatures.

Two temperature regimes were evaluated: the first averaged 28 C, with daily fluctuations ranging from 0 to 19.5 C; the second temperature regime averaged 16 C, with daily fluctuations ranging from 0 to 18.5 C. When average temperature was 28 C, cumulative tuber sprouting ranged from 88 to 92%, with no detectable differences among diurnal fluctuations. The high average temperature in the first study may have negated any type of enforced sprouting suppression. However, when average temperature was lowered to 16 C (simulating early spring diurnal fluctuations under polyethylene mulch), there was a positive linear correlation between maximum tuber sprouting and temperature variation. With an average temperature of 16 C, the absence of temperature variation resulted in 52% purple nutsedge sprouting, while 87% sprouting occurred when daily temperature varied 18.5 C at the same average temperature.

In a 4-month laboratory experiment, effects of the epigeic earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra on a succession of nematode community in litter of a mid-European birch/oak forest were tested in the gradient of an increase of diurnal temperature fluctuations from 0 degrees C (constant 15 degrees C; T(15)) to 10 degrees C (daily range between 10 degrees and 20 degrees C; T(10-20)) and 20 degrees C (daily range between 5 degrees and 25 degrees C; T(5-25)). Earthworm and temperature effects were measured as differences in nematode community respiration rates between the experimental treatments. Nematode respiration rates were calculated on the basis of body size/weight/O(2) consumption relationships for individual species. Nematode community was dominated by bacterial feeders and changed in a characteristic successional pattern which, however, was markedly modified by temperature regime and earthworm activities. Dominant nematode taxa revealed specific patterns of temporal dynamics in connection with their responses to temperature and earthworm presence. Thus, metabolic activity of Plectus acuminatus was strongly reduced by D. octaedra but did not react to variation of temperature regime. In contrast, activity of Panagrolaimus sp. significantly responded to temperature but not to earthworm presence, whereas Pl. thornei reacted to both factors separately and in combination. Ceratoplectus armatus was stronger affected by earthworm presence then by temperature; Tylocephalus auriculatus showed the opposite pattern. The variety of responses may explain the coexistence of several taxonomically related (Plectidae) and trophically similar species within the dominant group. Both earthworm presence and increase of the range of diurnal temperature fluctuations strongly affected the net of interspecific correlations within the nematode community. Earthworms strongly reduced total activities of nematode community at any temperature regime. T(15) regime showed markedly lower level of cumulative nematode respiration than both fluctuating regimes, irrespective of earthworm presence. In conclusion, combined effects of earthworms and temperature regime drastically changed patterns of relationships within the nematode litter community. The results of the experiments may have implications for the perspectives of global warming events at the study site: it is suggested that the ultimate vector of the changes in litter environment might be directed towards the conditions of the treatment [T(15) regime; earthworms present], with the corresponding trends in the development of the litter nematode community.",,,,,"Uvarov, Alexei/AAE-5342-2022; Kolosova, Nataliya G/AAR-7409-2020","Kolosova, Nataliya G/0000-0003-2398-8544",,,,,,,,,,,,,1505-2249,,,,,,2009,57,4,,,,,685,696,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000273093000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

SMOIS affects the daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and daily minimum temperature (Tmin) by altering the distribution of available energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes during the day and by altering the surface emissivity at night. Reduced soil wetness can increase both the Tmax and Tmin, but the effect on the DTR is determined by the relative strength of the effects on Tmax and Tmin. Observational data from the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL) and the Shapotou Desert Research and Experimental Station (SPD) suggest that the magnitude of the SMOIS effect on the distribution of available energy during the day is larger than that on surface emissivity at night. In other words, SMOIS has a negative effect on the DTR. Changes in Fg modify the surface radiation and the energy budget. Due to the depth of the daytime convective boundary layer, the temperature in daytime is affected less than in nighttime by the radiation and energy budget. Increases in surface emissivity and decreases in soil heating resulting from increased Fg mainly decrease Tmin, thereby increasing the DTR.

Diurnal temperature ranges were set at 5 degrees C, 10 degrees C and 15 degrees C with the same daily mean temperature and accumulated growing degree days (GDDa). All measured traits showed obvious DIF and varietal differences except the length of fiber bundle (LFB) and the inter-fiber bundle distance (IFBD). Significant interactions of DIF and cultivar were observed to affect the width of fiber bundle (WFB), the size of fiber cell (SFC), the size of fiber cell cavity (SFCC) and the thickness of fiber cell wall (TFCW). Compared with other DIFs, the number of fiber cells per bundle (NFCB) and WFB increased, but IFBD decreased under DIF 5. However, WFB, TFCW and NFCB all decreased under DIF 10. Under DIF 15 condition, both SFC and SFCC increased. For 'Ariane', IFBD was short under DIF 5, but SFC and SFCC were both large under DIF 10. For ` Argos', IFBD was also short under DIF 5. Under DIF 10, WFB, SFC and TFCW were all small, but IFBD was long. For ` Viking', TFCW was small under DIF 10 but large under DIF 15.

Using mortality data with high temporal resolution of zebra finches living in large outdoor aviaries (5 years, 359.220 bird-days), we show that mortality rate increases almost two-fold per 1 degrees C increase in diurnal temperature range (DTR). Interestingly, the DTR effect differed between two groups with low versus high experimentally manipulated foraging costs, reflecting a typical laboratory 'easy' foraging environment and a 'hard' semi-natural environment respectively. DTR increased mortality on days with low minimum temperature in the easy foraging environment, but on days with high minimum temperature in the semi-natural environment. Thus, in a natural environment DTR effects will become increasingly important in a warming world, something not detectable in an 'easy' laboratory environment. These effects were particularly apparent at young ages. Critical time window analyses showed that the effect of DTR on mortality is delayed up to three months, while effects of minimum temperature occurred within a week.

Observational records indicate that DTR has decreased over the last 50 yr because of differential changes in minimum and maximum temperatures. However, modeled changes in DTR in previous climate model simulations of this period are smaller than those observed, primarily because of an overestimate of changes in maximum temperatures. This present study examines DTR trends using the latest generation of global climate models participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and utilizes the novel CMIP5 detection and attribution experimental design of variously forced historical simulations (natural-only, greenhouse gas-only, and all anthropogenic and natural forcings). Comparison of observed and modeled changes in DTR over the period of 1951-2005 again reveals that global DTR trends are lower in model simulations than observed across the 27-member multimodel ensemble analyzed here. Modeled DTR trends are similar for both experiments incorporating all forcings and for the historical experiment with greenhouse gases only, while no DTR trend is discernible in the naturally forced historical experiment. The persistent underestimate of DTR changes in this latest multimodel evaluation appears to be related to ubiquitous model deficiencies in cloud cover and land surface processes that impact the accurate simulation of regional minimum or maximum temperatures changes observed during this period. Different model processes are likely responsible for subdued simulated DTR trends over the various analyzed regions.",,,,,"Lewis, Sophie/H-4968-2011; Karoly, David J/C-8262-2011","Lewis, Sophie/0000-0001-6416-0634; Karoly, David J/0000-0002-8671-2994",,,,,,,,,,,,,0894-8755,1520-0442,,,,NOV,2013,26,22,,,,,9077,9089,,10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00032.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00032.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000326216500022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The surface-atmosphere interactions are investigated based on single-column simulations of the DIurnal land-atmosphere Coupling Experiment and on global simulations. Low values of the surface thermal inertia increase the diurnal temperature range (DTR) and the daytime turbulent heat fluxes. The diurnal response of surface temperature to the thermal inertia is asymmetric between daytime and nighttime, inducing a change in the daily mean surface temperature that can reach several degrees over large areas. This asymmetrical response to thermal inertia is shown to be due to the diurnal contrast of the stability state of the atmospheric boundary layer. Thermal inertia in dry regions plays a critical role on both DTR and surface mean temperature and needs to be carefully represented in land surface models.",,,,,"Dufresne, Jean-Louis/I-5616-2015","Dufresne, Jean-Louis/0000-0003-4764-9600",,,,,,,,,,,,,0094-8276,1944-8007,,,,SEP 28,2015,42,18,,,,,7572,7580,,10.1002/2015GL065553,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GL065553,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000363412400042,View Full Record in Web of Science

Photosynthetic activity of small stands of Lolium perenne was continuously studied for up to two weeks under low photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) in the air temperature range from -3 degrees C to +9 degrees C. The photosynthetic rate of plants growing at 2, 6 and 9 degrees C was similar at 120 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD but the rate increased with increasing PPFD at all temperatures, particularly 9 degrees C. Light saturation of photosynthesis was reached at approx. 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 2 and 6 degrees C, and at approx. 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) at 9 degrees C. At 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), the CO2 exchange rate (CER) at 2 degrees C was approx. 60% of that at 9 degrees C. When the temperature increased gradually from 0 degrees C at start to +5 degrees C at the end of the 8-h photoperiod, CER decreased by about 20% compared with that at constant 5 degrees C. Changing the temperature from constant +5 degrees C to a diurnal variation between -2 and +2 degrees C gradually decreased daytime CER to approx. 10% after five days, partly due to leaf area losses (similar to 50% loss) when the poorly acclimatised plants were exposed to frost. At start of the photoperiod at -2 degrees C CER was negative, but became slightly positive when temperature exceeded -1 degrees C after two hours. Total daily photosynthesis was negative due to night-time respiration in this treatment. Soil heating to avoid freezing when the diurnal air temperature fluctuated between -3 and +3 degrees C had no effect on CER at this low PPFD level (150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). In contrast to the -2/+2 degrees C treatment, total daily photosynthesis was slightly positive in the -3/+3 degrees C treatment, where the plants were better acclimatised to frost. Increasing the CO2 concentration from 350 to 600 mu mol mol(-1) had no effect on CER at 2 and 6 degrees C, but increased it by 20% at 9 degrees C. The data indicate that the minimum temperature for photosynthesis in the cultivar studied is about -4 degrees C. The results can be applied in different photosynthesis models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These patterns have been disregarded for a long time because minor fluctuations of the E-H in the tens of mV range are difficult to interpret. Various explanations have been proposed for the origin of diel E-H but a cohesive assessment of the temperature-dependency for field- and laboratory-based investigations is missing at present. In this study, we investigated spatiotemporal diel E-H of previous long-term (up to 10 years) field- and lab-based monitoring data collected at high-temporal (every hour) and spatial (up to 6 depths) resolution. In addition, we set up a redox experiment where we manipulated the soil temperature (ST) by diel temperature cycles to assess the E-H response. Diel fluctuations were absent for laboratory experiments with Delta E-H of a few mV (daily EH-max - daily EH-min), but we found pronounced fluctuations up to similar to 100 mV for field investigations. The spatiotemporal pattern in E-H fluctuations was amplified in the topsoil during the summer months concomitant with ST. We showed for the first time that changes in ST during an incubation experiment altered the E-H by -3.3 mV degrees C-1 and inferred that the diel E-H were driven by the thermal conditions of the soil itself. This is particularly important when E-H is measured close to the soil surface and underlines that minor fluctuations of the E-H with a recurring periodicity should be carefully checked for its dependency with the soil and reference electrode temperature. Redox measurements should not be considered a routine determination and cautious handling of E-H data by physical sound corrections is urgently needed in order to link Delta E-H to daily biogeochemical cycling in soils.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2050-7887,2050-7895,,,,NOV 17,2021,23,11,,,,,1782,1790,,10.1039/d1em00254f,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1em00254f,,OCT 2021,,,,,,34704578,,,,,WOS:000711538600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The simulated diurnal and seasonal ranges of temperature are compared with observation, as is the day-to-day and interannual variability of temperature. The qualitative changes in these quantities due to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration are also presented. The simulation of the seasonal cycle of surface temperature has a cold bias in much of the extratropics, including central Europe, even allowing for the difficulties in comparing grid-box surface temperatures with station temperature at screen height. The simulated diurnal range of temperature for present-day climate is similar to that observed, though the diurnal cycle in the model in midlatitudes is generally less than observed. On doubling CO2, the diurnal range over land decreases by 0.3-degrees-C whereas mean temperatures increase by 6.3-degrees-C (global averages over land). In CO2-doubling experiments with a one-dimensional radiative-convective model, atmospheric absorption by carbon dioxide and water vapor increases, reducing the solar heating at the surface, and surface evaporation increases faster with temperature than the transfer of sensible heat (due to the Clausius-Clapyeron relation). both of which tend to reduce the diurnal cycle. However, in the three-dimensional model, the diurnal cycle increases substantially where the snow tine recedes, where the land surface becomes drier, or where there are substantial decreases in cloud cover. The diurnal cycle of surface temperature decreases where sea ice is replaced by open water because of the increase in thermal inertia of the surface. The simulated patterns of interannual standard deviation of surface temperature are in general agreement with observations, except in high latitudes in winter, where the model values are larger than the observed, and over the tropical oceans where model values are smaller than observed. The changes on doubling CO2 are generally small and not statistically significant. There are, however, reductions along the sea-ice margins in winter and increases in some regions of northern midlatitudes in summer. On doubling CO2, the general patterns of diurnal ranges and daily standard deviations of surface temperature change little, even though the changes in mean temperature are substantial and significant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0894-8755,,,,,SEP,1992,5,9,,,,,920,943,,10.1175/1520-0442(1992)005<0920:SDRAVO>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(1992)005<0920:SDRAVO>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992KF43200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To determine how clouds and moisture affect DTR physically on daily bases, the authors analyze the 30-min averaged data of surface meteorological variables and energy fluxes from the the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment and the synoptic weather reports of 1980-1991 from about 6500 stations worldwide. The statistical relationships are also examined more thoroughly in the historical monthly records of DTR, cloud cover, precipitation, and streamflow of this century. It is found that clouds, combined with secondary damping effects from soil moisture and precipitation, can reduce DTR by 25%-50% compared with clear-sky days over most land areas; while atmospheric water vapor increases both nighttime and daytime temperatures and has small effects on DTR. Clouds, which largely determine the geographic patterns of DTR, greatly reduce DTR by sharply decreasing surface solar radiation while soil moisture decreases DTR by increasing daytime surface evaporative cooling. Clouds with low bases are most efficient in reducing the daytime maximum temperature and DTR mainly because they are very effective in reflecting the Sunlight, while middle and high clouds have only moderate damping effects on DTR. The DTR reduction by clouds is largest in warm and dry seasons such as autumn over northern midlatitudes when latent heat release is limited by the soil moisture content. The net effects of clouds on the nighttime minimum temperature is small except in the winter high latitudes where the greenhouse warming effect of clouds exceeds their solar cooling effect. The historical records of DTR of the twentieth century covary inversely with cloud cover and precipitation on interannual to multidecadal timescales over the United States, Australia, midlatitude Canada, and former U.S.S.R., and up to 80% of the DTR variance can be explained by the cloud and precipitation records. Given the strong damping effect of clouds on the daytime maximum temperature and DTR, the well-established worldwide asymmetric trends of the daytime and nighttime temperatures and the DTR decreases during the last 4-5 decades are consistent with the reported increasing trends in cloud cover and precipitation over many land areas and support the notion that the hydrologic cycle has intensified.",,,,,"Trenberth, Kevin Edward/A-5683-2012; Dai, Aiguo/Y-2443-2019; Dai, Aiguo/D-3487-2009","Trenberth, Kevin Edward/0000-0002-1445-1000; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0894-8755,,,,,AUG,1999,12,8,2,,,,2451,2473,,10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012<2451:EOCSMP>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(1999)012<2451:EOCSMP>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082374600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The tropospheric how data, which is input to the model, includes both 500 hPa height and 500/1000 hPa thickness fields which are compressed via an EOF-technique. The regression coefficients are calculated from a 27 year record of analysed flow and locally observed DTR and cloudiness. The regression model has been used to down-scale the large-scale flow produced in a CO2 sensitivity experiment with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model (ECHAM-1). The down-scaled ''high CO2'' DTR is generally smaller than found when down-scaling the corresponding climate model control experiment. The opposite statement applies to cloudiness. DTR-anomalies of the order 2 Kelvin (K) are obtained in the central/northern parts of Fenno-Scandia in the middle of the 21st century while anomalies much closer to zero are found over the Iceland/Southern Greenland region. Consistent with this picture the cloudiness anomalies in the high CO2 case are predicted highest near the central/northern parts of Fenno-Scandia. The results presented here indicate that periods observed to be anomalously warm on a large-scale - corresponding to high CO2 concentrations - are also observed to be more cloudy and it is argued that clouds may have a thermostatic effect. We have calculated DTR and cloud cover trends at the 10 stations used in the regression model in order to assess if they are consistent with the predicted estimates and as such reflect a forcing of the climate system, We find that none of the stations show DTR/cloud cover trends significantly different from zero in the period 1961-1987.

Sporadic spatial distribution of weather stations causes a low spatial resolution of measured air temperatures. This study focused on modeling the air diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) based on the land surface temperature (LST) DTC. The air DTC model parameters were estimated from LST DTC model parameters by a regression analysis. Here, the LST obtained from the INSAT-3D geostationary satellite and the air temperature extracted from weather stations were used within the time frame of 4 March 2015 to 22 May 2017 across Iran. Constant parameters of the air DTC model for each weather station were estimated based on an experimental approach over the time period. Results showed these parameters decrease as elevation increases. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) for three hours sampling were calculated. The MAE and RMSE ranges were between [0.1, 4] degrees C and [0.1, 3.3] degrees C, respectively. Additionally, 95% of MAEs and RMSEs were less than 2.9 degrees C and 2.4 degrees C values, correspondingly. The range of the mean values of MAEs and RMSEs for a three-hour sampling time were [-0.29, 0.6] degrees C and [2, 2.11] degrees C. The DTC model results showed a meaningful statistical fitting in both air DTCs modeled from LST and weather station-based DTCs. The variability of mean error and RMSE in different land covers and elevation classes were also investigated. In spite of the complex behavior of the environmental variables in the study area, the model error bar did not show significantly biased estimations for various classes. Therefore, the developed model was less sensitive to variations of land covers and elevation changes. It can be conclude that the coefficients of regression between LST and air DTC could model properly the environmental factors.",,,,,"gholamnia, Mehdi/AAO-3003-2021; Alavipanah, Seyed Kazem/ABA-6179-2020; Kiavarz, Majid/ABG-5999-2021","gholamnia, Mehdi/0000-0003-2881-0024; Kiavarz, Majid/0000-0003-0335-3795",,,,,,,,,,,,,2072-4292,,,,,SEP,2017,9,9,,,,,,,915,10.3390/rs9090915,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9090915,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000414138700045,View Full Record in Web of Science

The open grassland field site in SE Australia was characterized by large seasonal and diurnal changes in air temperature. On each measurement day, leaf respiration rates in darkness were measured in situ at 2-3 h intervals over a 24 h period, with measurements being conducted at the ambient leaf temperature. The rate of respiration at a set measuring temperature (i.e. apparent 'respiratory capacity') was greater in seedlings grown under low average daily temperatures (i.e. acclimation occurred), both in the field and under controlled-environment conditions. The sensitivity of leaf respiration to diurnal changes in temperature (i.e. the Q(10) of leaf respiration) exhibited little seasonal variation over much of the year. However, Q(10) values were significantly greater on cold winter days (i.e. when daily average and minimum air temperatures were below 6 degrees and -1 degrees C, respectively). These differences in Q(10) values were not due to bias arizing from the contrasting daily temperature amplitudes in winter and summer, as the Q(10) of leaf respiration was constant over a wide temperature range in short-term experiments. Due to the higher Q(10) values in winter, there was less difference between winter and summer leaf respiration rates measured at 5 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. The net result of these changes was that there was relatively little difference in total daily leaf respiratory CO2 release per unit leaf dry mass in winter and summer. Under controlled-environment conditions, acclimation of respiration to growth temperature occurred in as little as 1-3 d. Acclimation was associated with a change in the concentration of soluble sugars under controlled conditions, but not in the field. Our data suggest that acclimation in the field may be associated with the onset of cold-induced photo-inhibition. We conclude that cold-acclimation of dark respiration in snow gum leaves is characterized by changes in both the temperature sensitivity and apparent 'capacity' of the respiratory apparatus, and that such changes will have an important impact on the carbon economy of snow gum plants.",,,,,"Ball, Marilyn/D-1180-2009; Atkin, Owen K/C-8415-2009; Atkin, Owen/O-2671-2019","Ball, Marilyn/0000-0001-9170-940X; Atkin, Owen K/0000-0003-1041-5202; Atkin, Owen/0000-0003-1041-5202",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-7791,1365-3040,,,,JAN,2000,23,1,,,,,15,26,,10.1046/j.1365-3040.2000.00511.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2000.00511.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000085589500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analysis is based on four-times- daily radiosonde data from 53 stations in four regions in the Northern Hemisphere, equatorial soundings from the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere/Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment, and more recent eight-times-daily radiosonde data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program's Central Facility in Oklahoma. Our results are in general qualitative agreement with earlier studies, with some quantitative differences, but provide more detail about vertical, seasonal, and geographic variations. The amplitude of the diurnal cycle (half the diurnal temperature range) is largest (1 to 4 K) at the surface. At 850 hPa and above, the regional-average amplitudes are <1 K throughout the troposphere and stratosphere. The amplitude of the diurnal cycle in the boundary layer is larger over land than over ocean, and generally larger in summer than winter (except for monsoon regions, where it is larger in the dry season). In the upper-troposphere and stratosphere, land-sea and seasonal differences are not prominent. The diurnal cycle peaks a few hours after local noon at the surface, a few hours later at 850 hPa, and somewhat earlier in the upper troposphere. The timing of the diurnal cycle peak in the stratosphere is more uncertain. Radiosonde data are also used to simulate deep-layer mean temperatures that would be observed by the satellite-borne microwave sounding unit, and the amplitude and phase of their diurnal cycles are estimated. An evaluation is made of the uncertainty in these results due to the temporal resolution of the sounding data, which is only barely adequate for resolving the first harmonic of the diurnal cycle, the precision of radiosonde temperature data, and potential biases in daytime stratospheric temperature observations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-897X,,,,,MAY 3,2005,110,D9,,,,,,,D09102,10.1029/2004JD005526,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004JD005526,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000229145800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Measurements of soil CO2 flux were made by the open-flow IRGA method. Temperature and ambient CO2 concentration, which are highly variable in time, were also monitored during the measurements. The Soil CO2 flux showed significant diurnal changes, and these patterns were highly correlated with the soil surface temperatures. The measured values ranged from 2.52 x 10(-2) to 8.54 x 10(-2) Mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in August and from -4.95 x 10(-3) to 1.13 x 10(-2) mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in February. Moreover, a negative linear relationship between soil CO2 flux and ambient CO2 concentration was found in diurnal fluctuations. To explore the mechanism of these daily cycles, we estimated Soil CO2 flux with a coupled model of soil microbial activity and gas diffusion. The parameter functions used in our calculation were obtained based on the measured values during the same time of soil respiration measurements. The soil CO2 production rates were obtained by laboratory experiments using the undisturbed soil core samples, which were taken from the field measuring soil respiration. The calculated soil CO2 flux ranged from 4.41 x 10(-2) to 7.78 x 10(-2) Mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in August and 1.14 x 10(-3) to 5.03 x 10(-3) mg CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in February. These patterns of diurnal variability were similar for the measured ones, and the daily amounts estimated by integrating the model outputs were almost equal to those from the measured values. However, the amplitude of the measured respiration rates was larger than that of the estimated ones. The differences between measured and estimated values were related with thermal gradient around soil surface. The calculation suggested that the soil horizon above 10 cm depth would be a major CO2 source of soil respiration at about 70% in August and 40% in February. The depth of soil horizon in which soil microbial activity was significantly higher was not settled and would have a seasonal variation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A germination experiment in darkness and light at different temperature regimes showed that P. australis germinated as well in darkness as in light over most of the temperature regimes tested. The germination requirements could partly explain why this species, despite a large annual production of small seeds, does not accumulate a persistent soil seed bank. A second experiment examined the effect of one to four diurnal temperature cycles with amplitude of fluctuations ranging from 0 to 30 degrees C; diurnal mean temperature of 15 degrees C. Germination in the absence of fluctuations was low, and logistic model estimates showed a positive effect of number of temperature cycles which was strongly influenced by amplitude size. For seeds that have fallen on moist ground during the winter, these laboratory results predict that a few large diurnal temperature fluctuations could be sufficient for onset of germination in the subsequently warmer spring period. Seeds that are located under water, however, are predicted to remain ungerminated until the water level falls. Hence, we suggest that the requirement for fluctuating temperature, in addition to being a sensor for 'exposed' seed sites, is also effectively acting as a germination timing mechanism.",,,,,"Per, Milberg/C-2618-2009; Milberg, Per/G-6153-2012","Milberg, Per/0000-0001-6128-1051",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-2585,,,,,JUN,1999,9,2,,,,,165,170,,10.1017/S0960258599000185,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0960258599000185,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081181400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, using climate model experiments, we explored the responses of temperature changes to black carbon (BC), CO2, and SO4 and found that the enhanced dryland warming induced by CO2 had the largest magnitude and was strengthened by the warming effect of BC. Moreover, the sensitivity of daily maximum and minimum temperature changes to BC, CO2, and SO4 was examined. It showed asymmetric responses of daily maximum and minimum temperature to radiative factors, which led to an obvious change of diurnal temperature range (DTR), especially in drylands. The DTR's response to CO2 is the most significant. Therefore, CO2 not only plays a dominant role in enhanced warming but also greatly affects the decrease of DTR in drylands.

However, the thermophile cucumber is known to be very sensitive to low temperatures. In particular, fruit growth decreases considerably as temperature declines. Nevertheless, reports show that cucumber can be grown successfully at low night temperatures. To explain this phenomenon, it is necessary to investigate the effect of the diurnal temperature variation on fruit growth. Fruit-bearing cucumber plants were grown in two experiments, either at a constant low temperature during the light and dark phase of 15 or 16 degrees C or at an extremely low temperature during the dark phase of 10 or 11 degrees C with an increase to 24 or 25 degrees C during the middle of the light phase resulting in a daily average of 15 or 16 degrees C, respectively. Introducing the diurnal temperature variation considerably increased fruit growth compared with cultivation at a constant temperature. The vegetative dry matter, however, was greater at a constant than at variable temperatures. Therefore, the total dry matter appeared to be unaffected by the treatments, meaning that photosynthesis was unaffected. Model calculations indicate that the relationship between temperature and fruit growth is not linear in the low-temperature range. For practical applications, it can be concluded that short daily periods with high temperature can mitigate the negative effect of low night temperature on fruit growth and yield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-5345,2327-9834,,,,JAN,2017,52,1,,,,,60,64,,10.21273/HORTSCI11215-16,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI11215-16,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000396526400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Geographic variation among populations in life history response to temperature mean and variability offers one view of the potential for local adaptation to broaden the thermal niche. We used laboratory growth experiments to examine the effects of temperatures between 13 degrees C and 30 degrees C on five life history traits and the intrinsic rate of increase for 15 Tigriopus californicus populations distributed over 17 degrees of latitude. Different life history stages showed distinct latitudinal shifts in thermal response, while the temperature of peak population growth consistently declined with increasing latitude. In addition, high-latitude populations grew faster at optimal temperatures but showed steeper fitness declines at high temperature. To test geographic population variation in response to the amplitude of daily thermal fluctuations, we grew three northern and three southern populations and manipulated nightly low and daily high temperatures. We found the lowest fitness overall in the treatment with the highest mean temperature, and the treatment with the greatest variability showed high fitness despite an 8 degrees C greater daily range. Population responses to daily thermal variability were unrelated to latitude of origin. Our results indicate that trade-offs between adaptation to high vs. low temperature, and between growth and maturation vs. survival and fecundity, govern local adaptation along the latitudinal gradient.

Thermal-response models of this type have not been validated under simulated field-variable temperature conditions that vary in diurnal pattern, diurnal range and longer-term trends in mean-daily temperature. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate germination response of thickspike wheatgrass (Elymus lanceolatus), bluebunch wheatgrass (Pscudoroegneria spicata), Sandberg bluegrass (Poa sandbergii) and bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides) under both constant and field-variable temperature regimes in the laboratory.

Seeds were germinated at seven constant temperatures between 5 and 35 degrees C, and under 18 variable-temperature regimes simulating six planting dates at three field sites. Predictions of germination time under variable-temperature conditions were accurate to within a fraction of 1 day up to a cumulative germination percentage of 70% for thickspike wheatgrass, 60% for bluebunch wheatgrass, 55% for Sandberg bluegrass and 70% for bottlebrush squirreltail.

Temperatures can also fluctuate rapidly, reaching values not revealed by climate data. Such fine-scale variation raises challenges for modelling species distributions under changing climates. To avoid misunderstanding current species distributions and future changes, temperatures must be modelled at high resolutions. Most existing methods either require extensive parameterization or are pre-parameterized for restricted localities and current conditions; here, we describe a more versatile method intended for European landscapes under a wide range of scenarios. The availability of high-resolution topographic data makes possible the use of projected solar irradiation to help predict local diurnal ground temperatures. Using time series from 83 points across Europe, we fitted statistical models for soil surface temperature based on geographical characteristics of the sites along with atmospheric variables obtained from a publicly available data base. The sites ranged from 40 degrees N to 60 degrees N and 2 degrees W to 25 degrees E, and from 43 to 1500m in elevation. We compare models for monthly mean and daily afternoon temperatures, for open and tree-covered habitats. The effect of topography was greatest for the daily predictions, and generally more important in open than in tree-covered sites. Tests with data collected from other European locations in a different time period suggest that our models can predict monthly means with an error standard deviation of about 2.3 degrees C. We provide an R function that implements our models on the basis of readily available data.

In arid and desert areas, the camel (Camelus dromedarius) is exposed to extreme environmental conditions. Since wide oscillations of ambient temperature (T-a) are a major factor in this environment, we wondered whether cyclic T-a fluctuations might contribute to synchronization of circadian rhythms. The rhythm of body temperature (T-b) was selected as output of the circadian clock. After having verified that T-b is synchronized by the LD and free runs in continuous darkness (DD), we submitted the animals to daily cycles of T-a in LL and in DD. In both cases, the T-b rhythm was entrained to the cycle of T-a. On a 12-h phase shift of the T-a cycle, the mean phase shift of the T-b cycle ranged from a few hours in LD (1 h by cosinor, 4 h from curve peaks) to 7-8 h in LL and 12 h in DD. These results may reflect either true synchronization of the central clock by T-a daily cycles or possibly a passive effect of T-a on T-b. To resolve the ambiguity, melatonin rhythmicity was used as another output of the clock. In DD melatonin rhythms were also entrained by the T-a cycle, proving that the daily T-a cycle is able to entrain the circadian clock of the camel similar to photoperiod. By contrast, in the presence of a LD cycle the rhythm of melatonin was modified by the T-a cycle in only 2 (or 3) of 7 camels: in these specific conditions a systematic effect of T-a on the clock could not be evidenced.

While mean ruminal pH was not different between corn or barley-fed steers, barley-fed steers had greater ruminal pH change throughout a 24 h period. Barley-fed steers also exhibited greater variation in ruminal pH. Additionally, intake patterns were different between corn- and barley-fed steers in which corn-fed steers consumed more feed the first 6 h directly after feeding while barley-fed steers consumed more feed later in the day. Presumably these intake patterns could be influenced by differences in the diurnal patterns of ruminal pH between corn and barley. By evaluating ruminal dynamics on a diurnal scale, we will enhance our understanding of utilization of different feedstuffs in beef feedlot diets. This study evaluated the effects of corn or barley finishing diets on ruminal pH and temperature and their relationship to feed intake events using continuous reticulorumen monitoring of feedlot steers. Average daily ruminal pH and temperature were not impacted (p >= 0.17) by diet. However, diet did affect daily variation of ruminal pH and temperature (p < 0.01). Average hourly ruminal pH displayed a diet by hour post-feeding interaction (p < 0.01), where barley-fed steers had greater (p < 0.01) ruminal pH than corn-fed steers at 0, 1, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 h post feeding, but had lower (p <= 0.05) ruminal pH than corn-fed steers at 6, 7, and 8 h post-feeding. Variation in ruminal pH hour post-feeding also displayed a diet by hour post-feeding interaction (p < 0.01), where barley-fed steers had greater (p <= 0.03) variation in ruminal pH at hours 1-17 post-feeding but did not differ (p >= 0.16) at 0, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 h post-feeding. Additionally, average hourly ruminal temperature exhibited a diet by hour post-feeding interaction (p < 0.01). In summary, basal grain interacted with time post-feeding influencing ruminal pH and temperature in feedlot steers.",,,,,,", Timothy/0000-0002-2247-9855; Wyffels, Samuel/0000-0003-3533-5022; Van Emon, Megan/0000-0002-6626-0249",,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-2615,,,,,OCT,2021,11,10,,,,,,,2809,10.3390/ani11102809,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11102809,,,,,,,,34679831,,,,,WOS:000712106900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, under high temperature conditions during the summer, especially in the southeastern United States, some mulches warm the soil to temperatures that might be deleterious to plant growth. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plants grown in the field were exposed to a range of root-zone temperatures (RZTs), resulting from growing the plants in different seasons and by using colored mulches that differed in their soil-warming ability. The objective was to determine the relationship of mean seasonal RZT, as affected by different colored plastic film mulches, with plant growth and fruit yield. The study consisted of experiments carried out in three seasons: Fall 1999 (five mulches, one cultivar), Spring 2000 (eight mulches and three cultivars), and Fall 2000 (four mulches and three cultivars). Treatments were black (n = 2), gray, red, silver (n = 3), and white (n = 2) mulches, and bare soil. Over the season, mean RZT decreased in the fall (from 32 to 24 degreesC) and increased in the spring (from 20 to 29 degreesC). Daily mean values of RZT over the season under plastic mulches were higher (1 to 5 degreesC) than those of air temperature. The highest RZT at midday occurred under black mulch, and the lowest under bare soil and white mulch. Bare soil showed the largest diurnal RZT fluctuation. RZT at midday was up to 4 degreesC higher under black or gray mulch compared to the other mulches or bare soil. The degree of soil warming was correlated with reflectivity of the mulch. Black mulch had the lowest light reflectance [10% photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)] while silver mulch had the highest (55% PAR). There were, however, differences in reflectance among mulches of the same color depending on the manufacturer. RZT affected vegetative top fresh weight (FW), fruit yield, fruit number, and individual fruit FW. All these growth attributes fitted a quadratic relationship with mean RZT for the season, with an optimal that ranged between 25.4 and 26.3 degreesC. The effects of colored mulches on plant response depended on the impact of the mulch on RZT. Plant growth and yield were highest as RZT approached the optimal RZT for the plants.",,,,,"Diaz-Perez, Juan C/D-7642-2014","Diaz-Perez, Juan C/0000-0002-4474-6715",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-1062,,,,,JAN,2002,127,1,,,,,127,135,,10.21273/JASHS.127.1.127,http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/JASHS.127.1.127,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000172659900020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The mechanisms of latewood formation and its responses to climates remain uncertain. Given that the tree-ring latewood of the taproot is absent belowground under conditions of low temperature gradients, we thus hypothesize that low diurnal temperature ranges (DTRs) may be one determining factor for latewood production. To evaluate this hypothesis, we designed experimental investigations by adding heat-protecting layers to the trunks of Pinus massoniana Lamb. to lower DTRs and simulate the environmental conditions underground in the Fuzhou area of humid subtropical China (HSC). We found that a decreased DTR induces a significant decline in latewood cell thickness and a slight reduction in latewood cell number and latewood density. DTRs played an important role in the formation of tree-ring width (TRW) and latewood width (LWW) rather than precipitation.

This paper proposed an improved heat-conduction-equation (HCE) method to reconstruct soil thermal field using two-depth measurements of soil temperature. The revised HCE method employed a direct approach as well as an indirect approach to estimate both the daily average soil temperature (DST) and the instantaneous soil temperature (IST), during which the annual temperature cycle and the diurnal temperature cycle are combined. Two validation experiments (i.e., Test-1 and Test-2) were performed with soil temperature measurements at five stations chosen from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). The results show that the revised HCE method improves the accuracy of modeling soil thermal field in comparison to its traditional form. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the ISTs estimated by the traditional HCE method range from 1.0 to 2.1 degrees C (2.4 to 4.8 degrees C) in Test-1 (Test-2); while the errors of the revised HCE method by the indirect approach are reduced to less than 1.0 degrees C in both Test-1 and Test-2; the errors by the direct approach are further reduced to less than 0.7 degrees C in both Test-1 and Test-2. The improved method has further potential to estimate soil heat flux, a variable that can be inferred using soil temperature gradients associated with soil apparent thermal conductivity.

Using SST diurnal variations (DeltaSSTgms) derived from the hourly VISSR SSTs and insolation, and the wind velocity derived from the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite/NASA Scatterometer (ADEOS/NSCAT), it is verified that the SST warming occurs under conditions of high insolation and weak wind. To investigate the DeltaSSTgms, two simple models are applied. One SST diurnal warming estimation model (Model A) is developed with reference to Price et al. [1986, 1987] introducing the latitudinal heat loss estimated from climatic values. Another model (Model B) was proposed by Webster et al. [1996]. Because SST diurnal warming is dependent on meteorological conditions, the areas of SST warming change from day to day. However, areas of weak wind and high insolation can be specified by large-scale atmospheric systems. Both distributions of the monthly averaged DeltaSSTmodel-A (SST diurnal warming estimated by Model A) and DeltaSSTgms agree well with each other.

Because temperature shows pronounced natural daily fluctuations, we examined if experiments based on a constant temperature range can mask the real effects of the thermal regime on host-parasitoid interactions. The effects of two fluctuating thermal regimes on several developmental parameters of the Drosophila larval parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi were analyzed in this study. Regime 1 included a range of 16-23-16 degrees C and regime 2 included a range of 16-21-26-21-16 degrees C (mean temperature 20.1 degrees C) compared to a 20.1 degrees C constant temperature. Under an average temperature of 20.1 degrees C, which corresponds to a cold condition of L. boulardi development, we showed that the success of parasitism is significantly higher under a fluctuating temperature regime than at constant temperature. A fluctuating regime also correlated with a reduced development time of the parasitoids. In contrast, the thermal regime did not affect the ability of Drosophila to resist parasitoid infestation. Finally, we demonstrated that daily temperature fluctuation prevented the entry into diapause for this species, which is normally observed at a constant temperature of 21 degrees C. Overall, the results reveal that constant temperature experiments can produce misleading results, highlighting the need to study the thermal biology of organisms under fluctuating regimes that reflect natural conditions as closely as possible. This is particularly a major issue in host-parasitoid associations, which constitute a good model to understand the effect of climate warming on interacting species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 50 embryos (Gosner stage ten) to metamorphosis (Gosner stage 46) of Rhinella humboldti, Hypsiboas crepitans and Engystomops pustulosus were exposed to each one of the three daily variable temperature treatments: high temperature (mean = 27.5(circle)C; maximum temperature = 34 +/- 1(circle)C; range = 23-35(circle)C), medium temperature (25.5(circle)C; 29 +/- 1(circle)C; 23-30(circle)C), and low temperature (24(circle)C; 24 +/- 1(circle)C; 23-25(circle)C).

Soil water potential slightly increased under B4.5 treatment but decreased under B9.0 treatment relative to the control. Reflectance increased in the near-ultraviolet and blue-light wavelengths (350-513 nm) and decreased in the infrared wavelength range (520-2350 nm) with biochar amendment. Biochar amendment reduced diurnal soil-temperature fluctuations on both daily and seasonal scales, although the annual average daily soil temperatures at a 5-cm depth showed no significant difference among treatments. Comparison with the control showed that biochar treatment moderated soil temperature extremes, lowering the temperature when soil temperature was high and raising it when soil temperature was low. This moderating capability was mostly within +/- 0.4 and +/- 0.8 degrees C for mean daily temperature and mean diurnal temperature of soil, respectively.

The influence of ground cover type (plants or buildings) on development is also shown. The developmental phases of preflowering and flowering are influenced to differing extents by climatic variables. The period during which climatic variables are effective before a given developmental phase varies considerably. The preflowering phases are best correlated with the mean of the minimum air temperature for the 15-day period before the observation, whereas flowering appears to be more dependent on the mean of the daily diurnal temperature range for the 8 days preceding the observation.",,,,,"Quénol, Hervé HQ/O-7939-2014","Quénol, Hervé HQ/0000-0002-5562-2232; dubreuil, vincent/0000-0001-8383-805X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0020-7128,1432-1254,,,,MAY,2009,53,3,,,,,287,298,,10.1007/s00484-009-0214-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-009-0214-7,,,,,,,,19219464,,,,,WOS:000265298100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the observation, the climatology of DTR during 1979-2014 displays a horizontal tile from southwest to northeast over East Asia. In addition, the observed DTR also presents an obviously declining trend in recent decades, with the magnitude of roughly-0.10 ? decade(-1). The historical all-forcing simulations well reproduce the geographical distributions and magnitude of climatology and trends of winter DTR over East Asia in 1979-2014. Furthermore, the winter DTR exhibits a continuous declining trend from the historical scenario to the future SSP245 scenario over East Asia, with the most significant declining during the first half of twenty-first century (i. e., 2021-2060). Based on the individual forcing experiments, it suggests that the greenhouse gases forcing plays a primary role in driving the climatology and trends of DTR over East Asia, especially for the SSP245 scenario. Further analysis indicates that the increasing precipitation under greenhouse gases forcing largely explain the declining DTR trends over East Asia, especially over the northern East Asia both in historical and SSP245 scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0169-8095,1873-2895,,,,DEC 15,2022,280,,,,,,,,106438,10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106438,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106438,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000865420800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study reports a statistical analysis of temperature variation with respect to land use throughout the day and night. It is also the first study to report the effects of land cover on the time that daily minimum and maximum temperature occurs. The land use characteristics considered included green space, streets, buildings, population density and bare land. Air temperature was measured for 42-months at the canopy level of five intra urban sites and one reference site in a lightly developed suburban location. The temperature of all intra-urban sites was higher than the suburban reference site for a majority of observations during daytime throughout the year. The effect of land use on air temperature overnight was greater than daytime. The highest temperature difference occurred overnight in summer, with differences up to 12 degrees C when comparing an irrigated, vegetated site and the suburban site on an hourly basis. On average, the daily maximum temperature in urban areas occurred sooner than in the suburb in all seasons.

In this paper, we evaluate the temperature-driven variations of these quantities for particulated and cemented material under Martian conditions of atmospheric pressure and temperature. Temperature-driven density variations are negligible. The specific heat of a basaltic material is strongly influenced by the temperature (similar to 75% increase from 150 to 315 K), inducing significant variations of the thermal inertia. The thermal conductivity of uncemented Martian regolith is weakly controlled by the solid phase conductivity and strongly controlled by the gaseous phase conductivity. As a result, the conductivity of the solid phase (i.e., composition, temperature) is unimportant, whereas medium to large variations (30-50%) of the bulk conductivity are associated with temperature-induced fluctuations of the pore-filling gas conductivity. Overall, the thermal inertia of uncemented Martian soils is predicted to vary significantly (similar to 80%) throughout the range of the observed surface temperatures. In the case of cemented soils, the contribution of the gas conductivity is generally small, and the solid phase (i.e., grains and cement) conductivity (i.e., composition, temperature) becomes more important. Consequently, the magnitude of the thermal inertia change for cemented soils is variable, and smaller than that predicted for uncemented materials (10-50%). Large diurnal and seasonal temperature variations only occur within the top material, and most of the near-surface regolith does not experience large thermal inertia variations. The shapes of modeled diurnal temperature curves are not significantly modified (e.g., the 0200 LT (Martian local time) apparent thermal inertia of uncemented regolith is up to similar to 15% lower than the average daily inertia of the top material). Thermally derived grain sizes are usually based on conductivity measurements operated at room temperature or above, where the thermal inertia and specific heat are higher than on Mars, implying that grain size predictions for Mars are currently underestimated. However, in situ observations by the Mars Exploration Rovers and thermal conductivity modeling suggest that this underestimation is not significant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9097,2169-9100,,,,JUL 21,2011,116,,,,,,,,E07004,10.1029/2011JE003805,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JE003805,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000293086200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It will refer to an experimental program that began at the Pig research Station of INRA four years ago. The feeding behaviour is mainly diurnal whichever the ambient temperature and the physiological stage. Over the temperature range studied, the decreased daily feed intake with increased temperature results, first, from a meal size reduction whereas its frequency remains constant. However, data obtained in lactating sows indicate that a further increase in heat stress intensity induces a reduction in daily number of meals. When temperature fluctuates over the day around a comfort value, both growing-finishing pigs and lactating sows adapt their feed intake to environmental conditions and the lower feed intake during the warm periods of the day is compensated by an increased feed intake during the fresh periods.

Diurnal air temperature range (DTRa) of rocklike buildings is commonsensically regarded as higher due to no latent heat from evapotranspiration and its smaller thermal inertia compared to wet soil. Therefore, the building DTRa is supposed to be higher than that of parks due to its building fabric. However, we found an opposite phenomenon (smaller building DTRa than that of parks), and the underlying mechanisms explaining this phenomenon are unclear. Here we conducted, in Beijing (China), a long-term observational campaign of standard meteorological variables and radiation/energy fluxes to provide a new valuable evidence (a part of external energy) to explain this phenomenon. The observations indicated external heat energies from horizontal advection and anthropogenic heat sources. We found a significantly lower building DTRa than that of parks (Delta DTRa = 2.53 +/- 1.93 degrees C), with a maximum difference of 3.54 +/- 1.96 degrees C in autumn; which was mainly attributed to higher daily minimum air temperature. We also found the large differences in air temperature contribution between the buildings and the parks happened mainly at night. The external heat sources of the building contributed 16.71% to the nighttime air temperature, which was higher than that of the parks (8.39%). The more indoor and outdoor anthropogenic heat sources in the building footprints were the major cause of the slower decrease in T-min.

A copper cuvette equipped with a PID-controlled Peltier element regulates cortex temperature in three modes: (1) synchronized with ambient air temperature; (2) at a constant difference in the range of +/-10degreesC from air temperature; and (3) constant at a temperature in a range of +/-25degreesC difference from ambient air. This method allows investigation of (a) respiratory capacity of woody plant parts dependent on short-term temperature variations, (b) CO2 release from woody plant parts following exposure to the sun, and (c) acclimation of woody plant parts to long-term changes of temperature. By use of the copper cuvette, temperature gradients in the cortex are drastically reduced. Therefore, studies on the effect of metabolically and physico-chemically based processes on diurnal variations of CO2 efflux from woody plant parts can be carried out. Field experiments were carried out on trees of Betula pendula, B. ermanii, and B. litwinowii. At synchronized temperatures of ambient air and woody plant tissue, daytime reductions of CO2 efflux relative to night-time rates at a given temperature from branches of B. pendula and B. ermanii were observed.

Land Surface Temperature (LST) products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are widely used to estimate Ta. Previous studies of these products in Ta estimation, however, were generally applied in small areas and with a small number of meteorological stations. This study designed both temporal and spatial experiments to estimate 8-day and daily maximum and minimum Ta (Tmax and Tmin) on three spatial scales: climate zone, continental and global scales from 2009 to 2018, using the Random Forest (RF) method based on MODIS LST products and other auxiliary data. Factors contributing to the relation between LST and Ta were determined based on physical models and equations. Temporal and spatial experiments were defined by the rules of dividing the training and validation datasets for the RF method, in which the stations selected in the training dataset were all included or not in the validation dataset. The RF model was first trained and validated on each spatial scale, respectively. On a global scale, model accuracy with a determination coefficient (R-2) > 0.96 and root mean square error (RMSE) < 1.96 degrees C and R-2 > 0.95 and RMSE < 2.55 degrees C was achieved for 8-day and daily Ta estimations, respectively, in both temporal and spatial experiments. Then the model was trained and cross-validated on each spatial scale. The results showed that the data size and station distribution of the study area were the main factors influencing the model performance at different spatial scales. Finally, the spatial patterns of the model performance and variable importance were analyzed. Both daytime and nighttime LST had a significant contribution in the 8-day Tmax estimation on all the three spatial scales; while their contribution in daily Tmax estimation varied over different continents or climate zones. This study was expected to improve our understanding of Ta estimation in terms of accuracy variations and influencing variables on different spatial and temporal scales.

The short yet high soil temperatures experienced due to passage of fire are conflated with the lower, but longer, temperatures experienced by daily fluctuations which occur after removing vegetation. These germination cues are able to break seed dormancy, but it is difficult to assess their specific level of influence because they occur consecutively after summer fires, just before the flush of germination in the wet season (autumn). By applying experimental fires, seed treatments were imposed that combined fire exposure/non-fire exposure with exposure to microhabitats under a gradient of disturbance (i.e. gaps opened by fire, mechanical brushing and intact vegetation). The seeds used were representative of the main families of obligate seeders (Ulex parviflorus, Cistus albidus and Rosmarinus officinalis). Specifically, an assessment was made of (1) the proportion of seeds killed by fire, (2) seedling emergence under field conditions and (3) seeds which remained ungerminated in soil. For the three species studied, the factors that most influenced seedling emergence and seeds remaining ungerminated were microhabitats with higher temperature fluctuations after fire (gaps opened by fire and brushing treatments). The direct effect of fire decreased the seedling emergence of U. parviflorus and reduced the proportion of seeds of R. officinalis remaining ungerminated. The relevance of depleting vegetation (and subsequent daily temperature fluctuation in summer) suggests that studies focusing on lower temperature thresholds for breaking seed dormancy are required. This fact also supports the hypothesis that the seeding capacity in Mediterranean Basin obligate seeders may have evolved as a response to a wide range of disturbances, and not exclusively to fire.",,,,,"Baeza, Jaime/H-9145-2015; Baeza, M.Jaime/AAB-5997-2019; Santana, Victor M./J-2299-2014; Davo-Blanes, M Carmen/ABC-5041-2021","Baeza, Jaime/0000-0002-9739-0062; Baeza, M.Jaime/0000-0002-9739-0062; Santana, Victor M./0000-0002-6121-1747; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-7364,1095-8290,,,,JAN,2013,111,1,,,,,127,134,,10.1093/aob/mcs238,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs238,,,,,,,,23129044,,,,,WOS:000312653000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is well understood that environmental factors and breeding site characteristics play a role in organismal development and the potential to transmit pathogens. In this study, we observe the impact of larval density in combination with diurnal temperature on the time to pupation, emergence, and mortality of Aedes aegypti. Experiments were conducted at two diurnal temperature ranges based on 10 years of historical temperatures of Houston, Texas (21-32 degrees C and 26.5-37.5 degrees C). Experiments at constant temperatures (26.5 degrees C, 32 degrees C) were also conducted for comparison. At each temperature setting, five larval densities were observed (0.2, 1, 2, 4, 5 larvae per mL of water). Data collected shows significant differences in time to first pupation, time of first emergence, maximum rate of pupation, time of maximum rate of pupation, maximum rate of emergence, time of maximum rate of emergence, final average proportion of adult emergence, and average proportion of larval mortality.

The objective of this work was to analyze trends in extreme temperature indices in Aguascalientes. With RClimdex 1.0 and data on daily maximum (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min), 16 temperature indices were calculated. The trend in indices was determined with the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test (p <= 0.05), while the rate of change was obtained with Theil-Sen's trend estimator. Significant positive trends were observed in 72 time series of indices associated withT(max)and in 39 time series of indices associated withT(min). Significant negative trends were observed in 22 time series of indices associated withT(max), and in 45 time series of indices associated withT(min). In some regions of Aguascalientes, diurnal warming is occurring; in others, warmer or less cold nights prevail. The changes in extreme temperature indices might have severe implications in the use of irrigation water, cause physiological stress in crops, promote respiratory and cardiac diseases, and improve the reproduction cycles and populations of insects. Also, the fruit production, such as guava, could be affected under the reduction of minimum temperature, and the increase in warm days where other fruit trees are cultivated can intensify the use of chemical compensators of cold. These results are of significance for long-term economic planning and design of strategies of adaptation/mitigation to climate change. In Aguascalientes, the changes observed in extreme temperature indices could be due to climate change of a bigger scale, either regional or at the watershed level.",,,,,"Capurata, Ronald Ernesto Ontiveros/B-8277-2016","Capurata, Ronald Ernesto Ontiveros/0000-0002-5094-0469; Enciso, Juan/0000-0001-5984-6826",,,,,,,,,,,,,0177-798X,1434-4483,,,,NOV,2020,142,3-4,,,,,1425,1445,,10.1007/s00704-020-03391-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03391-1,,SEP 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000572055600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, due to the distinct temperature ranges of various seasons in different places, these devices' power generation performance may be seriously impaired. In this paper, a new double-PCM-based thermoelectric energy-harvesting device based on temperature fluctuations in the ambient environment is proposed to improve device performance. A double-PCM-based device has been built and tested in an environment with a large temperature range (0-40 degrees C) for three days. Experimental results show that the average output power of the double-PCM-based thermoelectric energy-harvesting device under matched load resistance outperforms that of the single-PCM device by 35.8%. A one-dimensional unsteady heat transfer model is established to describe the temperature variation of PCMs. The influence of phase change is considered through variations in PCMs' specific heat capacity. This work demonstrates that the proposed double-PCM-based thermoelectric energy-harvesting device performs better over a large temperature range and is more suitable for small electronic devices operating at different times and in different places.

An accurate predictor of calving would enable supervision of cows more precisely to a relevant time interval so that obstetrical assistance can be provided in a timely manner. This might help to decrease calf mortality rate. Evidence exists that cows exhibit a decrease in body temperature before the onset of calving. The performance of a decrease in body temperature as a test to predict the onset of calving in dairy cows has not been investigated. The objective was to investigate test criteria of a decrease in vaginal and rectal temperature as predictors of calving in dairy cows. In 3 experiments, temperature loggers (Minilog 8, Vemco Ltd., Halifax, Canada) were inserted into the vagina of cows before calving (n = 85), and rectal temperatures were measured twice daily in 55 of these cows. Vaginal temperatures were 0.2 to 0.3 degrees C and 0.6 to 0.7 degrees C lower on the day of calving compared with 24 and 48 h before calving, respectively. Rectal temperatures were 0.3 to 0.5 degrees C and 0.4 to 0.6 degrees C lower on the day of calving compared with 24 and 48 h before calving, respectively. Vaginal temperatures exhibited a diurnal rhythm during the 120 h before calving, which continued on a lower level during the 48 h preceding parturition. In the 3 experiments, a decrease in vaginal temperature of >= 0.3 degrees C over 24 h could predict calving within 24 h, with sensitivity ranging from 62 to 71% and specificity ranging from 81 to 87%. Similarly, a decrease in rectal temperature measured at 0730 h of >= 0.3 degrees C could predict calving within 24 h, with sensitivity from 44 to 69% and specificity from 86 to 88%. Although dairy cows exhibit a distinctive decrease in vaginal and rectal temperatures commencing approximately 48 h before calving, detecting this decrease does not determine the onset of calving precisely.

The spatially detailed structure of SST, expressed in high-resolution SST data, had relatively little impact on SAT. On the other hand, the difference in areal mean value of SST strongly affected SAT across a wide range of land surfaces. When a spatially inhomogeneous distribution was used for the urban fraction and anthropogenic heat, and appropriate physical properties for building materials were given according to the specific urban categories, we achieved significant improvements in both the diurnal range of SAT and its daily mean. Based on a comparison with an additional sensitivity experiment for building albedo, the sophistication of urban fraction and thermal parameters related to building materials had a comparable impact on SAT as presumable building albedo in the daytime, while they indicated a larger impact on the nighttime SAT. We conclude that (1) the areal mean SST is critical rather than its resolution for the climatological average of SAT over the land; (2) the simultaneous refinement of the urban fraction and building material parameters, as well as an appropriate building albedo setting, greatly improves the representation of SAT; and (3) the refinement of areal mean SST and the urban data have the same degree of importance for a better representation of the SAT.",,,,,"Takahashi, Hiroshi G./AGO-4606-2022; Hara, Masayuki/D-3584-2014; Adachi, Sachiho/C-5682-2016; Hara, Masayuki/N-9754-2019; Takahashi, Hiroshi G.

By performing scaled outdoor measurements in summer of 2017 in Guangzhou, China, we investigate these impacts on spatial/temporal characteristics of urban thermal environment which are still unclear so far. Two types of street canyon models are investigated, i.e. the 'hollow' model resembling hollow concrete buildings and the 'sand' model consisting of buildings filled with sand attaining much greater thermal storage. For each model, three street aspect ratios (building height/street width, H/W = 1, 2, 3; H = 1.2 m) are considered. The diurnal variations of air-wall surface temperatures are observed and their characteristics are quantified for various cases. The daily average temperature and daily temperature range (DTR) of wall temperature vary significantly with different aspect ratios and thermal storage. During the daytime, wider street canyon (H/W = 1) with less shading area experiences higher temperature than narrower ones (H/W = 2, 3) as more solar radiation received by wall surfaces. At night, wider street canyon cools down quicker due to stronger upward long wave radiation and night ventilation. For hollow models, H/W = 1 attains DTR of 12.1 degrees C, which is 1.2 and 2.1 degrees C larger than that of H/W = 2, 3. Moreover, the sand models experience smaller DTR and a less changing rate of wall temperature than hollow models because larger thermal storage absorbs more heat in the daytime and releases more at night. DTR of hollow models with H/W = 1, 2, 3 is 4.5, 4.6 and 3.8 degrees C greater than sand models respectively. For both hollow and sand models, wider streets experience a little higher daily average temperature (0.3-0.6 degrees C) than narrower ones. Our study provides direct evidence in how man-made urban structures influence urban climate and also suggests the possibility to control outdoor thermal environment by optimize urban morphology and thermal storage.

In April and May 2007, experiments were completed to determine the effects of fluctuating temperature on Pocillopora meandrina and Porites rus, and consecutive trials were used to expose them for 13 days to 26 degrees C, 28 degrees C (ambient conditions), 30 degrees C, or a fluctuating treatment ranging from 26 to 30 degrees C over 24 h. The multivariate response was assessed using maximum dark-adapted quantum yield of PSII (F-V/F-M), Symbiodinium density, chlorophyll-a content, and calcification. In trial 1, multivariate physiology of both species was significantly affected by treatments, with the fluctuating temperature resulting in a 17-45% decline in Symbiodinium density (relative to the ambient) matching that occurring at a constant 30 degrees C; F-V/F-M, chlorophyll-a content, and calcification, did not differ between the fluctuating and the steady treatments. In contrast, in trial 2 that utilized corals collected two weeks after those used in trial 1, the corals were unaffected by the treatments, likely due to an environment x trial interaction caused by seasonal declines in Symbiodinium density. Together, these results demonstrate that short transgressions to ecologically relevant high and low temperatures can elicit a potentially detrimental response equivalent to that occurring upon exposure to a constant high temperature.

This diurnal variation is attributed to motivational, peripheral, and central factors and higher core and, possibly, muscle temperatures in the evening. This study investigated whether decreasing evening resting rectal temperatures to morning values, by immersion in a water tank, leads to muscle force production and power output becoming equal to morning values in motivated subjects. Ten healthy active males (mean +/- SD: age, 22.5 +/- 1.3 yrs; body mass, 80.1 +/- 7.8 kg; height, 1.72 +/- 0.05 m) completed the study, which was approved by the local ethics committee of the university. The subjects were familiarized with the techniques and protocol and then completed three sessions (separated by at least 48 h): control morning (07: 30 h) and evening (17: 30 h) sessions (with an active 5-min warm-up on a cycle ergometer at 150 W) and then a further session at 17: 30 h but preceded by an immersion in cold water (similar to 16.5 degrees C) to lower rectal temperature (T-rec) to morning values. During each trial, three measures of grip strength, isokinetic leg strength measurements (of knee flexion and extension at 1.05 and 4.19 rad s(-1) through a 90 degrees range of motion), and three measures of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) on an isometric dynamometer (utilizing the twitch-interpolation technique) were performed. T-rec, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and thermal comfort (TC) were also measured after the subjects had reclined for 30 min at the start of the protocol and prior to the measures for grip, isokinetic, and isometric dynamometry. Muscle temperature was taken after the warm-up or water immersion and immediately before the isokinetic and MVC measurements. Data were analyzed using general linear models with repeated measures. T-rec values were higher at rest in the evening (by 0.37 degrees C; p<0.05) than the morning, but values were no different from morning values immediately after the passive pre-cooling. However, T-rec progressively decreased throughout the experiments, this being reflected in the subjects' ratings of thermal comfort. Muscle temperatures also displayed significant diurnal variation, with higher values in the evening (by 0.39 degrees C; p<0.05). Right grip strength, isometric peak power, isokinetic knee flexion and extension for peak torque and peak power at 1.05 rad s(-1), and knee extension for peak torque at 4.19 rad s(-1) all showed higher values in the evening (a range of 3-14%), and all other measures of strength or power showed a statistical trend to be higher in the evening (0.10 > p > 0.05). Pre-cooling in the evening significantly reduced force or power variables towards morning values. In summary, effects of time of day were seen in some measures of muscle performance, in agreement with past research. However, in this population of motivated subjects, there was evidence that decreasing evening T-rec to morning values by coldwater immersion decreased muscle strength to values similar to those found in the morning. It is concluded that diurnal changes in muscle performance are linked to diurnal changes in T-rec.

Records of soil temperature were obtained at five depths (2, 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm) below the surface of the earth at Akole, Abeokuta, between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2014. The soil temperature varied from 27.75 degrees C at depth 200 cm to 29.9 degrees C at 2 cm. The diurnal temperature range for depths between 2 and 200 cm during the dry season was higher (about 18 degrees C) than that during the rainy season (about 12 degrees C). The temporal variation of ground temperature from the surface at different depths was analyzed by Fourier technique, and thermal diffusivity was computed using amplitude and phase angles of the first three harmonics of the annual thermal wave. The coefficients of soil temperature obtained by Fourier analysis depict the impartial description of the variation with depth of the soil temperature waves. Among the three harmonics calculated, the first harmonic described soil temperature variation to 95.07% while the first two harmonics described the variation to 98.72%. Further harmonics contribute insignificantly to the improvement of the variation. The annual damping depths of the study area calculated from the phase angle and amplitude angle and directly from daily average soil temperatures were 217.39, 227.27, and 217.90 cm, respectively.

Most laboratory studies that have characterized the influence of temperature on development in amphibians have failed to incorporate the realities of diel temperature fluctuations (DTF), which can be considerable for pond-breeding amphibians. Results: We evaluated the effects of different ecologically relevant ranges of DTF compared with effects of constant temperatures on development of embryos and larvae of the Korean fire-bellied toad (Bombina orientalis). We constructed thermal reaction norms for developmental stage, snout-vent length, and tail length by fitting a Gompertz-Gaussian function to measurements taken from embryos after 66 hours of development in 12 different constant temperature environments between 14 degrees C and 36 degrees C. We used these reaction norms as null models to test the hypothesis that developmental effects of DTF are more than the sum of average constant temperature effects over the distribution of temperatures experienced. We predicted from these models that growth and differentiation would be positively correlated with average temperature at low levels of DTF but not at higher levels of DTF. We tested our prediction in the laboratory by rearing B. orientalis embryos at three average temperatures (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 28 degrees C) and four levels of thermal variation (0 degrees C, 6 degrees C, 13 degrees C, and 20 degrees C). Several of the observed responses to DTF were significantly different from both predictions of the model and from responses in constant temperature treatments at the same average temperatures. At an average temperature of 24 degrees C, only the highest level of DTF affected differentiation and growth rates, but at both cooler and warmer average temperatures, moderate DTF was enough to slow developmental and tail growth rates. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that both the magnitude of DTF range and thermal averages need to be considered simultaneously when parsing the effects of changing thermal environments on complex developmental responses, particularly when they have potential functional and adaptive significance.",,,,,"Jukar, Advait/AAU-6165-2021","Jukar, Advait/0000-0002-1525-1246; Park, Daesik/0000-0001-9209-0493",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1472-6785,,,,MAY 4,2013,13,,,,,,,,18,10.1186/1472-6785-13-18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6785-13-18,,,,,,,,23641898,,,,,WOS:000318936400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Physical mechanisms are sought which could explain possible changes in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) under conditions of increased atmospheric greenhouse gas content. We show that an important contribution to changes in DTR is given by soil moisture.In areas where soil moisture increases due to an increase in precipitation there is a positive change in latent heat flux and a decrease in sensible heat flux.As a result, in areas with increasing soil moisture, the increase in maximum daytime temperature will be smaller than that in minimum temperature, thereby causing a decrease in the DTR. The opposite occurs for areas which undergo soil drying. This process amplifies the effect of cloud changes on surface solar and infrared radiation and dominates the direct effect of downward infrared radiation associated with increasing greenhouse gas concentration. Because the soil water content is largely controlled by precipitation, our results are consistent with early observational findings of negative correlation between changes in precipitation and in diurnal temperature range.",,,,,"Giorgi, Filippo/C-3169-2013","Verdecchia, Marco/0000-0002-5134-9128",,,,,,,,,,,,,0094-8276,,,,,JUL 1,1994,21,14,,,,,1527,1530,,10.1029/94GL00188,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94GL00188,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NV98600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Models of rates of development at constant temperatures of an example insect are compared graphically with predicted rates under artificial and naturally varying temperature regimes. Acceleration of insect development at low temperatures and retardation at high temperatures are shown to be implicit to the assumption of nonlinearity of development. The influence of the diurnal range of the temperature regime on the rate summation effect and the interaction between rate summation and the mathematical structure of a particular development rate model are clearly demonstrated. This study shows that the selection of a development rate function for prescriptive use, based on closeness of fit to developmental data from constant temperature experiments, is meaningless. Nor should selection be based on how well a model derived from constant temperature experiments predicts insect development measured under a narrow range of fluctuating temperatures. Reasons why a nonlinear model fitted directly to rates observed under variable temperature laboratory or field data is inappropriate for subsequent prediction (in theory at least), are clearly demonstrated.

Accompanying this rapid warming are significant increases in summer mean daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, annual hottest day temperature and warmest night temperature, and an increase in frequency of summer days and tropical nights, while the change in the diurnal temperature range (DTR) is small. This study focuses on understanding causes of the rapid summer warming and associated temperature extreme changes. A set of experiments using the atmospheric component of the state-of-the-art HadGEM3 global climate model have been carried out to quantify relative roles of changes in sea surface temperature (SST)/sea ice extent (SIE), anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), and anthropogenic aerosols (AAer). Results indicate that the model forced by changes in all forcings reproduces many of the observed changes since the mid-1990s over Western Europe. Changes in SST/SIE explain 62.2 +/- 13.0 % of the area averaged seasonal mean warming signal over Western Europe, with the remaining 37.8 +/- 13.6 % of the warming explained by the direct impact of changes in GHGs and AAer. Results further indicate that the direct impact of the reduction of AAer precursor emissions over Europe, mainly through aerosol-radiation interaction with additional contributions from aerosol-cloud interaction and coupled atmosphere-land surface feedbacks, is a key factor for increases in annual hottest day temperature and in frequency of summer days. It explains 45.5 +/- 17.6 % and 40.9 +/- 18.4 % of area averaged signals for these temperature extremes. The direct impact of the reduction of AAer precursor emissions over Europe acts to increase DTR locally, but the change in DTR is countered by the direct impact of GHGs forcing. In the next few decades, greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to rise and AAer precursor emissions over Europe and North America will continue to decline. Our results suggest that the changes in summer seasonal mean SAT and temperature extremes over Western Europe since the mid-1990s are most likely to be sustained or amplified in the near term, unless other factors intervene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0930-7575,1432-0894,,,,MAR,2017,48,5-6,,,,,1537,1554,,10.1007/s00382-016-3158-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-016-3158-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000395060900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mean aspirated temperature differences were greater during the evening (0.47 degrees C) than during the day (0.16 degrees C). This was particularly true for evenings following greater daytime solar insolation (20+ MJ day(-1)) with surface winds from the direction of the built environment where mean differences exceeded 0.80 degrees C.

For constant temperature regimes, this temperature sum can be reliably used to predict hatch and development of WCR larvae. In the first experiment in climate cabinets, we evaluated the effects of varying day-night (4 and 6 A degrees C difference) temperature regimes compared to equivalent constant temperature regimes on hatch, development, and recovery of WCR larvae from a non-diapausing population. Relative to constant diurnal temperatures, varying day-night temperatures resulted in earlier larval hatch and accelerated larval development (especially when day-night temperatures differed by 6 A degrees C) due to direct temperature effects (i.e., the Kaufmann-effect) and to enhanced plant growth. For WCR eggs, the temperature sums needed for hatch in the field are overestimated when they are determined by models based on constant experimental temperatures. Recovery of larvae from soil was not affected by temperature, but was positively associated with plant height. In a second experiment we evaluated whether the found effect of varying temperature ranges on the acceleration of larval hatch is also influenced by the level of these varying temperatures. Initial hatch started earlier by varying diurnal temperatures only under a low-temperature regime (14 +/- A 4 A degrees C). For herbivorous insects like WCR, plant growth effects induced by varying temperature regimes may result in increased variation in temperature-based developmental parameters.

The model captured the diurnal cycle as the positive and negative peaks at 1200 and 0000 UTC with intensities at the peaks similar to 0.5 mm high and low, respectively, in the model simulation when compared with the observations. Presently, the seasonal forecast of ISM is generated through ensemble CAM experiments using different ICs taken from different dates but all at 0000 UTC. Consideration of ICs at different times of the day will add different ranges of diurnal variations in all the surface parameters within the family of ensemble members and also increase the number of members in the family. Indeed, these improve the ensemble processes in generating the seasonal forecast of ISM.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0033-4553,1420-9136,,,,OCT,2015,172,10,,,,,2777,2790,,10.1007/s00024-014-0944-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-014-0944-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000362679200020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Discharge and scream-area measurements were used to determine infiltration rates. Stream and subsurface temperatures were used to interpret subsurface flow through variably saturated sediments beneath the stream. Spatial variations in subsurface temperatures suggest that flow beneath the streambed is dependent on the orientation of the stream in the canyon and the layering of the sediments. Streamflow and infiltration rates vary diurnally: Streamflow is lowest in late afternoon when stream temperature is greatest and highest in early morning when stream temperature is least. The lower afternoon streamflow is attributed to increased infiltration rates; evapotranspiration is insufficient to account for the decreased streamflow, The increased infiltration rates are attributed to viscosity effects on hydraulic conductivity from increased stream temperatures. The first set of field data was used to calibrate a two-dimensional variably saturated flow model that includes heat transport. The model was calibrated to (1) temperature fluctuations in the subsurface and (2) infiltration rates determined from measured streamflow losses. The second set of field data was to evaluate the ability to predict infiltration rates on the basis of temperature measurements alone. Results indicate that the variably saturated subsurface flow depends on downcanyon layering of the sediments. They also support the field observations in indicating that diurnal changes in infiltration can be explained by temperature dependence of hydraulic conductivity. Over the range of temperatures and flows monitored, diurnal stream temperature changes can be used to estimate streambed infiltration rates. Tit is often impractical to maintain equipment for determining infiltration rates by traditional means; however, once a model is calibrated using both infiltration and temperature data, only relatively inexpensive temperature monitoring can later yield infiltration rates that are within the correct order of magnitude.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,,,,,SEP,1998,34,9,,,,,2137,2153,,10.1029/98WR01572,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/98WR01572,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000075674800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two experiments performed in growth chambers (1) analyzed light (complete darkness or 12 h light) and temperature (10/5, 15/5, and 20/10 C day/night temperatures) requirements for germination, and (2) determined base temperature (T-b) for germination. An outdoor pot trial was also set up to study emergence patterns. All species showed higher germination in complete darkness than they did with a light regime, irrespective of dormancy level, time of the year, and temperature regime under which germination was tested, illustrating better germination when seeds are buried. T-b ranged from -2.6 to 0 C, depending on the species, indicating low temperature requirements for germination. Given their higher germination in daily fluctuating, rather than constant temperatures, the three Papaveraceae species should have the capacity to form persistent seed banks. These species behaved as winter annuals (from November to February) in the pot experiment and had difficulties to emerge in spring.

Gastric motility was never completely inhibited but could be markedly reduced. Stomach temperature was maintained at around 38degreesC. The fact that stomach temperature of incubating birds did not show a daily rhythmic fluctuation as seen in non-breeding birds could be due to temperature constraints on embryo development.

The objective of this study was to assess the potential of infrared thermography (IRT) sensing by monitoring soil surface temperature (SST) with a high spatiotemporal and thermal resolution in a scalable agricultural application. We monitored soil surface temperature (SST) variations over a 48 h period for three treatments in a vineyard: bare soil (plot S), 100% biochar cover (plot B), and biochar-amended topsoil (plot SB). The SST of all plots was monitored at 30 min intervals with a tripod-mounted IR thermal camera. The soil temperature at 10 cm depth in the S and SB plots was monitored continuously with a 5 min resolution probe. Plot B had greater daily SST variations, reached a higher daily temperature peak relative to the other plots, and showed a faster rate of T increase during the day. However, on both days, the SST of plot B dipped below that of the control treatment (plot S) and biochar-amended soil (plot SB) from about 18:00 onward and throughout the night. The diurnal patterns/variations in the IRT-measured SSTs were closely related to those in the soil temperature at a 10 cm depth, confirming that biochar-amended soils showed lower thermal inertia than the unamended soil. The experiment provided interesting insights into SST variations at a local scale.

However, LHF depicts a diurnal variability in the strong wind regime (> 6 ms(-1)) with a range of similar to 13 Wm(-2) at 8 degrees N and similar to 17 Wm(-2) at 12 degrees N and 15 degrees N. In the strong wind regime, SHF shows heat gain by the ocean with a maximum (minimum) value during the daytime (night), while it shows heat loss from the ocean in the weak wind regime with maximum (minimum) value during the night (daytime). The diurnal range of SHF does not show significant meridional variation in the strong (similar to 3.5 Wm(-2)) and weak (similar to 2 Wm(-2)) wind regime. The difference in sub-daily evolution of air-temperature, air-specific humidity, and wind speed determines distinct evolutions of LHF and SHF in different wind regimes, which appears to be driven by atmospheric boundary layer processes and eastward propagating land-sea breeze signals over the BoB. Finally, we also establish the relationship between sub-daily evolutions of turbulent heat fluxes in the different wind regimes with synoptic conditions associated with the active and break phases of the Indian summer monsoon.",,,,,"Keyes, Dennis/AAZ-9285-2021","M S, Dr. girishkumar/0000-0003-3717-7187",,,,,,,,,,,,,0930-7575,1432-0894,,,,FEB,2021,56,3-4,,,,,917,934,,10.1007/s00382-020-05512-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05512-y,,NOV 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000584966100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Variations in water level, and therefore in-channel water volume, not only have the potential to directly impact stream temperature, but also aquatic vegetation coverage which, in turn, may affect stream temperature patterns and dynamics. Manipulation experiments provide a systematic approach to investigate the multiple environmental controls on stream temperature patterns. This study aims to use temperature data loggers and fibre optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) to investigate potential drought impacts on patterns in surface water and streambed temperature as a function of change in water column depth. To quantify the joint impacts of water level and associated vegetation coverage on stream temperatures, investigations were conducted in outdoor flumes using identical pool-riffle-pool features, but with spatially variable water levels representative of different drought severity conditions. Naturally evolved vegetation growth in the flumes ranged from sparse vegetation coverage in the shallow flumes to dense colonization in the deepest. Observed surface water and streambed temperature patterns differed significantly within the range of water levels and degrees of vegetation coverage studied. Streambed temperature patterns were more pronounced in the shallowest flume, with minimum and maximum temperature values and diurnal temperature variation being more intensively affected by variation in meteorological conditions than daily average temperatures. Spatial patterns in streambed temperature correlated strongly with morphologic features in all flumes, with riffles coinciding with the highest temperatures, and pools representing areas with the lowest temperatures. In particular, the shallowest flume (comprising multiple exposed features) exhibited a maximum upstream-downstream temperature warming of 3.3 degrees C (T in = 10.3 degrees C, T out = 13.5 degrees C), exceeding the warming observed in the deeper flumes by similar to 2 degrees C.

In 2 independent trials, temperatures evaluated were 39, 37, or 35 degrees C (trial 1) and 39, 33, or 31 degrees C (trial 2). In Exp. 2, 4 pregnant rumen cannulated cows grazing in January were fitted with Kahne (KB1000) temperature continuous recording boluses for 22 d. Two grazed in a paddock provided cold water (8.2 degrees C) and 2 in a paddock provided warm water (31.1 degrees C). Two in situ trials were conducted placing 6 in situ bags containing 2 g of winter range ruminal extrusa in each of the 4 ruminally cannulated cows and incubating bags for 72 h for measurement of NDF disappearance.

In the past 50 years in arid regions, measured reductions in the daily temperature range of air (DTRair) most likely generated similar reductions in the unmeasured daily temperature range of soil (DTRsoil). However, the role of DTRsoil in regulating microbial and plant processes has not been well described. We experimentally reduced DTRsoil in the Chihuahuan Desert at Big Bend National Park over 3 years. We used shade cloth that effectively decreased DTRsoil by decreasing daily maximum temperature and increasing nighttime minimum temperature. A reduction in DTRsoil generated on average a twofold increase in soil microbial biomass carbon, a 42% increase in soil CO2 efflux and a 16% reduction in soil NO3--N availability; soil available NH4+-N was reduced by 18% in the third year only. Reductions in DTRsoil increased soil moisture up to 15% a few days after a substantial rainfall. Increased soil moisture contributed to higher soil CO2 efflux, but not microbial biomass carbon, which was significantly correlated with DTRsoil. Net photosynthetic rates at saturating light (A(sat)) in Larrea tridentata were not affected by reductions in DTRsoil over the 3 year period. Arid ecosystems may become greater sources of C to the atmosphere with reduced DTRsoil, resulting in a positive feedback to rising global temperatures, if increased C loss is not eventually balanced by increased C uptake.

Large temperature fluctuation was mostly detrimental (lower juvenile survival, slower growth, smaller body size, and longer development), whereas moderate temperature fluctuation usually gave responses similar to the constant regime. Whendeveloping in fluctuating temperatures, adult longevity (no effect), body size (lower), and wing shape (narrower wings) deviated from the expectations based on the constant temperature reaction norms, presumably because of acclimation responses. Contrary to some studies no obvious beneficial effects of moderate temperature fluctuation were observed. Instead, yellow dung flies seem to canalize development in the face of temperature fluctuation up to a point when detrimental effects become unavoidable.

A 56-d incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of constant and variable temperatures on SOC mineralization. Three soils were collected from the karst region in western Guizhou Province, southwestern China, including a limestone soil under forest, a limestone soil under crops and a yellow soil under crops. According to the World Reference Base (WRB) classification, the two limestone soils were classified as Haplic Luvisols and the yellow soil as a Dystric Luvisol. These soils were incubated at three constant temperatures (15, 20 and 25 degrees C) and cyclically fluctuating temperatures (diurnal cycle between 15 and 25 degrees C). The results showed that the 56-d cumulative SOC mineralized (C-56) at the fluctuating temperatures was between those at constant 15 and 25 degrees C, suggesting that the cumulative SOC mineralization was restricted by temperature range. The SOC mineralization responses to the fluctuating temperatures were different among the three soils, especially in contrast to those at constant 20 degrees C. Compared with constant 20 degrees C, significant (P < 0.05) decreases and increases in C56 value were found in the limestone soil under forest and yellow soil under crops at the fluctuating temperatures, respectively. At the fluctuating temperatures, the forest soil with lower temperature coefficient Q(10) (the relative change in SOC mineralization rate as a result of increasing the temperature by 10 degrees C) had a significantly (P < 0.05) lower SOC mineralization intensity than the two cropland soils. These indicated that differences in temperature pattern (constant or fluctuating) could significantly influence SOC mineralization, and SOC mineralization responses to the fluctuating temperatures might be affected by soil characteristics. Moreover, the warmer temperatures might improve the ability of soil microbes to decompose the recalcitrant SOC fraction., and cyclical fluctuations in temperature could influence SOC mineralization through changing the labile SOC pool size and the mineralization rate of the recalcitrant SOC in soils.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1002-0160,2210-5107,,,,AUG,2015,25,4,,,,,512,523,,10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30032-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(15)30032-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000358630600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study we examined this relationship using 16 yr of annual measurements of herbaceous standing crop recorded at two study sites located on the Corona Range and Livestock Research Center in central New Mexico. Our hypothesis was that end-of-season herbaceous standing crop estimations could be improved using measured soil moisture instead of seasonal accumulations of rainfall as traditionally used for yield prediction. Daily recorded and simulated soil moisture levels were used to estimate the number of days over the growing season when soil moisture by volume was at low (< 20%), intermediate (20% to 30%), or high (>= 30%) levels. Defining regression equations to include either simulated or probe-recorded measures of soil moisture improved the adjusted R-2 of the regression models from 46% for the rainfall model to over 60% for various soil moisture models. Key variables for explaining annual variation in herbaceous production included seasonal moisture conditions, the amount of broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae [Pursh] Britt. & Rushy) present on the area, and the degree days of temperature accumulated over the growing season. Diurnal daily temperatures near historical averages were most advantageous for forage production. Simulated soil moisture data improved predictive grass yield estimates to a level equivalent to using onsite moisture probes to categorize daily moisture conditions.

Our approach lies in the statistical analysis of about 6 years of daily paired temperature observations taken using the ancient Montsouri shelter and the modern Stevenson screen for daily maximum (T-x) and minimum (T-n) temperature data recorded at two experimental sites: the meteorological gardens of La Coruna and Murcia, Spain (locations under the influence of the Oceanic/Atlantic/Galician and Mediterranean arid and semi-arid climate types, respectively), where ongoing field trials have been carried out. Descriptive statistical analysis of the paired series shows pre-sheltered temperatures tended to induce a strong warm bias in T-x data (of about 1 degrees C at the annual scale but with a clear seasonal cycle with higher values in summer and lower in winter), while T-n readings have a small (similar to 0.2 degrees C, and sustained all year round) cold bias compared to the modern period. Statistical relationships between the screen bias and other related meteorological variables show the highest correlation coefficients between the 'screen bias' and T-x, T-n and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) recorded under the replicated ancient shelters at both locations and point to the reliability of these variables as potential predictors of the Delta T-x. We generate a parsimonious regression model based on the data from both experimental sites, which takes into account polynomial terms of lower order for the predictor variables (T-x and DTR recorded under the ancient shelter) and harmonic terms, in order to represent the seasonal cycle of the screen bias. The goodness-of-fit of the model is satisfactory, as it explains up to 51.7% of the additional Delta T-x variability. Copyright.

Data were collected by three Brazilian research vessels at 10 individual sites, between 24 degrees S and 33 degrees S, During the measurements, the ships were stationed or drifted. At every location, series of temperature, salinity and density profiles were taken in the upper 50 m, accompanied by shipboard meteorology observations. At some locations, measurements of surface and underwater solar irradiance were also performed. The duration of time series varied from 8-72 h, The sampling intervals ranged between 0.5 and 3 h but normally were of one hour. Total duration of the series was 186 h, and the total number of individual hydrographic profiles in the dataset amounts to 159. The diurnal cycle of temperature was determined by fitting a sum of diurnal and semi-diurnal Fourier harmonics to the data. The diurnal range of SST varied from 0.1 degrees C to over 1.2 degrees C, controlled mostly by cloudiness and wind speed, The average range was about 0.5 degrees C for summer and 0.4 degrees C for winter observations, In most cases the observed diurnal cycle of temperature was confined to the uppermost 10 to 15 m. The phase lag between solar irradiance and sea temperature was normally about 4 h at the surface and increased downwards, typically by about one hour per every meter of depth. The sensible and latent fluxes exhibited regular diurnal variability, The divergence of the turbulent heat flux at a given depth in the bulk of the water column showed pronounced diurnal cycle, sometimes changing from - 150 to + 50 W m(-3) in the course of 8 to 12 h. A strong diurnal cycle of stratification was observed in the northern part of the region, with the average night-time values of buoyancy frequency smaller than the day-time ones approximately by one order of magnitude, while south of 31 degrees S stratification was mostly salinity controlled and represented small diurnal variation. In 3 of the observations, the night-time surface cooling led to convective instabilities and related overturns soon after midnight, resulting in rapid restratification of the water column and sign reversal of turbulent heat Bur. The vertical size of the overturns was about 10 m in two of the three cases and over 20 m in the third case, while the temporal scale was 1-3 h. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

An organism's environment, particularly early in development, can profoundly shape its future phenotypes. While the long-term consequences of embryonic temperature are well studied in vertebrates, insects have complex life cycles that may uncouple temperature's effects in one stage from physiology in the next. 2. This study examines how egg temperature affects insect performance across all subsequent life stages. We focused on the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, and examined how egg temperatures affected hatching time, hatchling mass, larval growth, development time, head capsule size, pupal mass and adult fecundity. Eggs were exposed to either diurnal temperature cycles or a single heat shock; in both experiments, temperatures were within the range to which eggs are typically exposed in the field. 3. Although the consequences of egg temperature varied depending on the type of treatment, both cycling temperatures and heat shock affected egg development time and initial larval growth rate, which likely have fitness consequences for M. sexta in nature. In contrast, egg temperature had no persistent effect on any trait measured in later larval stages, pupae or adults. 4. Organisms with complex life cycles -Manduca has four distinct life stages and multiple larval sub-stages - may benefit from rapid compensation for poor early conditions. Additionally, the modularity of insect life cycles may help insects cope with environmental variability by insulating later stages from disturbances during embryogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,JUN,2011,25,3,,,,,548,556,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01807.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2010.01807.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290174500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The temperature factor was the main one conditioning the development of microgemipopulations. Special experimental observations on the development of rediae in the mollusc Melanopsis praemorsa (L., 1758) under different temperature conditions have shown that heating to 26-30-degrees increases significantly and cooling to 10-12-degrees, on the contrary, decreases the speed of the development of both maternal and daughter rediae. Normal development of rediae is possible within a temperature range from 5-7 to 34-35-degrees. The upper threshold of the range is limited by a fast death of infected snails when water temperature is over 35-36-degrees (in all cases the parasite's death was registered after the death of its intermediate host). Cooling below 6 C arrests the development of Ph. rhionica rediae. A long maintenance of microgemipopulation at a temperature close to 0 C leads to its death but does not always result in the death of the mollusc-host. Temperature is an important regulator of Ph. rhionica rediae reproduction speed but temperature fluctuations do not lead to transition from one type of embryo formation to another. The correlation between rediae and cercariae number is regulated only by the level of microgemipopulation development. Temperature is not the main regulatory factor for the daily rythm of cercariae emission but it affects the activity and life longevity of larvae.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-1847,,,,,JUL-AUG,1991,25,4,,,,,349,359,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1991GR84300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Reliable simulation of mulched soil surface temperature is important for initial growth of spring crops. The hybrid Root Zone Water Quality-Simultaneous Heat and Water (RZ-SHAW) model and the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model use different approaches to quantify the effect of plastic film mulching on soil temperature. A two-year field study was conducted to compare the performance of the RZ-SHAW model and DNDC model for simulating the 5-cm soil temperature (T-5) under varying plastic film mulching coverages during seedling emergence of spring maize. Three treatments were used in this study: no mulching (PMO), full plastic film mulch (PM100), and partial plastic film mulch with 60 % coverage, i.e. 60 cm width of plastic every meter (PM60). Compared with no mulching, PM100 and PM60 treatments enhanced daily maximum and average T-5 (2.53 degrees C and 1.25 degrees C, respectively; p < 0.05) while not affecting the diurnal sinusoidal phase change of T-5 (2.45 degrees C and 1.21 degrees C, respectively; p < 0.05). The RZ-SHAW model was robust for T-5 simulation under mulching condition with RMSE and NSE ranged from 2.01 degrees C to 2.51 degrees C and 0.68 to 0.84, respectively, while the DNDC model failed to predict T-5 for mulched soil with RMSE and NSE ranged from 2.79 degrees C to 4.33 degrees C and 0.25 to 0.46, respectively. Employing T-ms (air temperature between plastic film and soil surface) to replace soil surface temperature may be one reason for the poor T-5 simulation of DNDC in mulched plots. By contrast, the RZ-SHAW model ran a complete calculation for heat and vapour transfer within the mulched layer, which robustly simulated atmosphere-soil surface temperature gradient in the plant canopy, surface covering, and soil surface in a broader range of climatic conditions. Additionally, the longwave radiation reflected back to the soil surface by the plastic, which was not considered by DNDC model, was important and enhanced T-5 simulation performance for RZ-SHAW under mulching condition.

The opaque cloud field itself has distinct cold and warm season diurnal climatologies; with a near-sunrise peak of cloud in the cold season and an early afternoon peak in the warm season. There are two primary climate states on the Canadian Prairies, separated by the freezing point of water, because a reflective surface snow cover acts as a climate switch. Both cold and warm season climatologies can be seen in the transition months of November, March, and April with a large difference in mean temperature. In the cold season with snow, the diurnal ranges of temperature and relative humidity increase quasi-linearly with decreasing cloud, and increase from December to March with increased solar forcing. The warm season months, April to September, show a homogeneous coupling to the cloud cover, and a diurnal cycle of temperature and humidity that depends only on net longwave. Our improved representation of the diurnal cycle shows that the warm season coupling between diurnal temperature range and net longwave is weakly quadratic through the origin, rather than the linear coupling shown in earlier papers. We calculate the conceptually important 24-h imbalances of temperature and relative humidity (and other thermodynamic variables) as a function of opaque cloud cover. In the warm season under nearly clear skies, there is a warming of +2 degrees C and a drying of -6% over the 24-h cycle, which is about 12% of their diurnal ranges. We summarize results on conserved variable diagrams and explore the impact of surface windspeed on the diurnal cycle in the cold and warm seasons. In all months, the fall in minimum temperature is reduced with increasing windspeed, which reduces the diurnal temperature range. In July and August, there is an increase of afternoon maximum temperature and humidity at low windspeeds, and a corresponding rise in equivalent potential temperature of 4.4K that appears coupled to increased precipitation.

Composite analysis shows that areas away from the equator exhibit stronger seasonal variations of DSST, while weaker seasonal variations appear near the equator. The most interesting characteristic is the distinctive contrast of the seasonal variations of DSST between the Bay of Bengal (BOB) and the region south of the equator (particularly around 12 degrees S). While the range of DSST is weakest in the BOB during boreal summer, it has its largest range around 12 degrees S in austral summer. Furthermore, BOB DSST exhibits two peaks that occur during the monsoon transitions (March-April and October), whereas DSST south of the equator shows only a single peak in its annual cycle.Using a one-dimensional, oceanic, mixed layer model, the authors examined the cause of the distinctive annual cycles of DSST north and south of the equator. Two parallel experiments were conducted at buoy sites 12 degrees N, 90 degrees E and 12 degrees S, 80.5 degrees E driven by surface forcing from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) product. The results demonstrated that, in the BOB, both surface shortwave radiation and wind stress contribute to the March maximum, whereas the wind stress alone drives the October maximum. In contrast, the seasonal variation of DSST south of the equator is primarily caused by the annual cycle of the wind stress, which is extremely weak in austral summer near the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). How the monsoon and ITCZ modulate the distinctive annual cycles of DSST is discussed.",,,,,"Yu, Weidong/I-7130-2013","Yu, Weidong/0000-0003-2503-2415",,,,,,,,,,,,,0894-8755,1520-0442,,,,NOV,2015,28,21,,,,,8466,8485,,10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00826.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00826.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000363766200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Though broodstock has been maintained in captivity, detailed culture conditions are lacking. The present study investigated the effects of rearing temperature on reproductive conditioning. During a 4-week period, broodstock were subjected to temperature regimes characteristic of stable spring temperatures (spT), increasing spring to summer temperatures (sp-suT) and increasing spring to summer temperatures with daily fluctuations of 1 degrees C (sp-suT2). Broodstock were monitored for fecundity, egg lamella development and maturation, larval release rate, nauplius size and survival over 24 h. Cultured broodstock were fecund at smaller sizes (15.94 +/- 0.23 mm RC) than wild-collected individuals at the beginning of the experiment (17.71 +/- 0.65 mm RC). Fecundity increased significantly in all treatments and development of egg lamellae was highest in treatments in which the temperature increased over the experimental period (average 36% of mature egg lamellae in comparison to an initial 0%). Increasing temperature led to greater maturation of lamellae and more frequent spawning peaks. The number of nauplii released per aquarium (average 110 adult individuals) varied according to treatment and time, averaging 4670 +/- 506 nauplii day(-1). Due to the low number of larvae released daily, it is suggested that adults might release larvae gradually, as embryos hatch within the mantle cavity. Average release rates increased towards the end of the conditioning period, with releases on peak days ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 nauplii per aquarium. For spT, peak values were observed in week 3, while sp-suT and sp-suT2 showed peaks of release in weeks 2 and 4, when temperatures averaged 20 and 23 degrees C, respectively. Temperature oscillations led to shorter intervals between peaks of release. In terms of the larvae released, there were neither differences in numbers between treatments (128,147 +/- 13,548 nauplii per aquarium over 28 days) nor in size of nauplii (202.89 +/- 0.69 mu m GW) or 24-h survival (91.56 +/- 0.35%). Notwithstanding the need for further optimization, broodstock reproductive conditioning can be accomplished and a continuous supply of larvae obtained using the protocols described herein. Future studies should focus on the impact of food quality and photoperiod on reproductive conditioning, as well as the optimization of larval release induction protocols. Statements of relevance: The stalked barnacles (Pollicipes pollicipes) are considered a high-value food delicacy on the Iberian Peninsula, where interest over the culture of this species has risen in recent years. However, very little is known with regard to culture conditions. The paper addresses the effect of temperature on the reproduction in captivity of this new species to culture and establishes the first working protocol for P. pollicipes reproduction and larval collection in culture.

In this study, we used an automated sampling system to measure NO fluxes with a high temporal resolution over two years (daily measurements from January 2019 to December 2020) in a mixed forest in Northeast China.

The contribution of NO emission during the growing season was 92% of the yearly NO flux. Soil temperature was the most important edaphic factor in regulating NO emission, explaining 90-92% of the seasonal variation. The apparent temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) of NO flux was 3.67. In the growing season, NO emission was also influenced by soil moisture, with optimum soil moisture of 37% WFPS.

The range of sampling from hourly to twice daily are explored to determine the uncertainty that is introduced by sampling less frequently than hourly in the determination of daily temperature and daily temperature extrema. The standards for comparison for the daily average temperature are the average of hourly data and the average of the daily maximum and minimum temperature. Hourly temperature data from 12 Canadian climate stations are examined for several decades leading up to 2017. Daily average temperatures were calculated using data sampled 24 times a day (hourly), 12 times, 8 times, 6 times, 4 times and twice daily. Two triad algorithms from the literature and an experimental one are assessed relative to these sampling frequencies. The sampling frequency analysis was remarkably consistent across all climate stations. The departure from the hourly estimate ranged from 0.1 degrees C for the bi-hourly sampling to similar to 1 degrees C for the twice daily sampling. The uncertainty associated with the min/max method consistently fell within that of three and four samples per day. Comparison of triad algorithms, based on a quantitative criterion for determination of best sampling hours, revealed a station specific triad that outperforms algorithms from the literature and thrice daily evenly spaced sampling. Minimum and maximum estimates were compared across the different sampling frequencies for all stations as well. The accuracy of estimating temperature extrema decreases with lower sampling rates with the exception of the 8 hr sampling where hour of sampling influences accuracy.

Nematostella vectensis is a burrowing sea anemone that inhabits estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North America from Nova Scotia (45 degrees N) to Georgia (31 degrees N). Like other estuarine species, N. vectensis is exposed to large daily (>20 degrees C) and seasonal (>25 degrees C) fluctuations in temperature, requiring wide temperature tolerances. At the same time, the natural distribution of this species spans a pronounced thermal cline, which may promote the evolution of different temperature optima and tolerances in populations. We tested the thermal tolerance of N. vectensis adult and developmental stages, which showed all life cycle stages had critical temperatures within 1 degrees C (lethal temperature 39.5 to 40.5 degrees C). When temperature tolerance values were compared with recorded field data, N. vectensis is living in environments very close to their physiological limit. We utilized common garden experiments (13, 21, and 29 degrees C) to test for temperature-specific growth and regeneration rates in N. vectensis from different portions of this species' range. Temperature had a significant effect on growth and regeneration rate in all clonal lines, with a significant negative relationship between latitude of origin and growth rate at 29 degrees C. Individuals from higher latitudes did not exhibit higher growth rates at cooler temperatures. Together, our results show a combination of broad thermal tolerances for developmental and adult stages and evidence for local adaptation to higher temperatures in populations living in lower latitude locations that would be physiologically compromised with future warming.",,,,,"Tarrant, Ann/AAU-8263-2021; Reitzel, Adam M/A-9129-2017","Tarrant, Ann/0000-0002-1909-7899; Reitzel, Adam M/0000-0001-5734-7118",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,2013,484,,,,,,115,130,,10.3354/meps10281,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps10281,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000320321300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we show, by means of dedicated high-resolution atmospheric model experiments, that sufficient daily variability in the extratropical background SST needs to be resolved to force a statistically significant large-scale atmospheric response to decadal North Pacific SST anomalies associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is consistent with observations.

Knowledge of the implications of vineyard row orientation/microclimate is required for decision-making in current and future macro- and mesoclimates. Temporal and cumulative microclimatic changes, induced by vine row orientation (NS; EW; NE-SW; NW-SE) of vertically trellised Shiraz grapevines, on berry pulp temperature and composition at different ripeness levels were investigated. Berries dynamically gained heat energy relative to: ambient climate/weather; direct canopy wall/bunch irradiance; and berry skin colour development. Berries exposed to direct solar radiation during the morning, leading to higher pulp temperatures than ambient, but having a cooling profile after that, resulted in slightly advanced sugar ripening and generally higher skin total anthocyanins and phenols, without significant effects on pH and titratable acidity, at the respective ripeness levels. In contrast, excessive exposure of bunches and those that built up heat, reaching highest temperatures during late afternoon, seemed not conducive to grape composition associated with higher quality. The S, SE, E and NE canopy sides showed consistently higher skin total anthocyanin and phenol contents than their counter sides. Except for acylated forms of peonidin-glucoside, anthocyanin (mono-, acetyl- and coumaroyl-glucosides) accumulation was mostly favoured in berries exposed to exterior canopy sides, but differences in acylated anthocyanins between exterior-facing and interior-facing berries were less than for monoglucoside anthocyanins. Over-exposure and heat peaking during late afternoon seemed detrimental. Novel information on berry pulp temperature variation in a developing composite grape bunch, exposed to weather and microclimate fluctuation, is provided. An ostensibly homogeneous bunch in reality represents a dynamic berry pulp thermal range at any point in time. Cumulative thermal and radiation impact was evident.

The Arctic is warming at twice the global average rate; how native and non-native anadromous fishes will respond remains largely unknown. Some native Arctic salmonids are already experiencing warm (>21 degrees C), physically challenging migratory river conditions and large diurnal temperature fluctuations (>10 degrees C). 2. We conducted field and laboratory experiments to determine how these extreme conditions may affect the capacity for migration in Arctic and temperate salmonids. 3.In adult migratory Arctic char, reflex impairment following a handling challenge increased with temperature, indicating more extensive fatigue. In Arctic char smolts, temperature did not affect initial critical swimming performance (U-max1), however, there was a threshold for repeat swimming performance (U-max2) near 20 degrees C, above which recovery was impaired. 4. Following a simulated diurnal warming scenario (11-21 degrees C), U-max1 increased in rainbow trout and remained constant in Arctic char as in the field while U-max2 remained constant in rainbow trout it was drastically reduced in Arctic char. Furthermore, at warm temperatures, Arctic char were unable to recover to routine levels of oxygen uptake after exercise, while rainbow trout were. Warming also had more pronounced effects on blood composition and plasma glucose and lactate concentration in Arctic char than in rainbow trout. 5. In general, rainbow trout, a temperate salmonid, had superior swimming performance, aerobic capacity, and warm tolerance than Arctic char, an Arctic salmonid. 6. The present flow and temperature regimes in some Arctic rivers may restrict migration of native salmonids by limiting their ability to recover from fatiguing exercise.

Daily ranging distance and activities were negatively associated with proportion of mature leaves in diet of the only female that we tracked. Rainfall had negative effects on activities of the males, while temperature had no significant influence. The current study suggested an energy conservative strategy of P. philippensis.

Special attention was paid to the anomalously cool summers over northeastern Japan caused by northeasterly winds called Yamase. The results are validated against the daily mean surface temperatures observed by the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) in the study area. Ensemble mean downscaling forecasts can successfully extract reliable signals with information about local circulations. The ensemble mean forecasts reduce the root mean square errors of the daily mean surface temperature by 15 % compared to single downscaling forecasts. The ensemble spreads also indicate the possibility of making prob-abilistic predictions that consider the effects of local circulations in addition to large-scale motions. The ensemble downscaling forecasts have 80 % larger spreads than the global forecasts with the JMA global spectral model at a resolution TL159L60 and approach the theoretical value. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis indicates that the predictability depends on the EOF modes. The predictable periods are 8 days for the homogeneous mode over northeastern Japan, 5 days for the Yamase mode (east-west mode), and 2 days for the north-south mode. The dynamical downscaling can properly predict the amplitudes of the EOF modes. In particular, the dynamical downscaling can predict 90 % of the Yamase mode, as compared to 20 % prediction of the global model for the same mode.",,,,,"Iwasaki, Toshiki/AAE-1601-2019","Iwasaki, Toshiki/0000-0003-2110-0687",,,,,,,,,,,,,0026-1165,2186-9057,,,,,2014,92,6,,,,,505,517,,10.2151/jmsj.2014-601,http://dx.doi.org/10.2151/jmsj.2014-601,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000348588700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Infected and uninfected populations of two P. caudatum genotypes were created and four constant temperature treatments (26 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 32 degrees C) compared with four variable treatments with the same mean temperatures. Variable temperature treatments were achieved by alternating populations between permissive (23 degrees C) and restrictive (35 degrees C) conditions daily over 30 days. Variable conditions and high temperatures caused greater declines in Paramecium populations, greater fluctuations in population size and higher incidence of extinction. The additional effect of parasite infection was additive and enhanced the negative effects of the variable environment and higher temperatures by up to 50 per cent. The variable environment and high temperatures also caused a decrease in parasite prevalence (up to 40%) and an increase in extinction (absence of detection) (up to 30%). The host genotypes responded similarly to the different environmental stresses and their effect on parasite traits were generally in the same direction.

This paper analyses the geographical dispersion in the PV operating conditions observed at low temporal resolutions (day, month and year) at two PV plants located, respectively, in the south of Portugal and the north of Spain. It shows that daily irradiation deviations are significantly higher than is commonly supposed. Furthermore, once the measurement points are a certain distance apart (a few hundred metres), the deviations in irradiation appear to be independent of distance. This could help to determine how many irradiance sensors to install in order to reduce uncertainty. Daily mean temperature differences between different points at a large-scale PV plant range from 1 to 7K and are not related to the distance between measurement points.

In a homogeneous water column, a rise in temperature induced marked increases in fish swimming activity, heart rate and heart beat-to-beat variability, In a thermally stratified environment, voluntary activity also increased when the thermal structure of the water column was altered, though no temperature-dependent changes in heart rate were observed, In this case, fish avoided the new temperature conditions, exhibiting distinct thermoregulatory behaviour, Stratification of the water column also prompted daily cyclic changes in fish distribution, animals tending to be in deeper and colder water layers during the day and in shallower and warmer layers at night. Respirometry experiments revealed that the thermoregulatory behaviour observed in free-ranging fish was probably driven by the energetic expedient of maintaining the physiological status quo - i.e. avoiding bioenergically costly reacclimation processes, Indeed, acute temperature increases or decreases of 2.5 degrees C led to marked differences in oxygen consumption, with metabolic rate changes of 15 and 30%, respectively, The persistent linear relationship between heart rate and oxygen consumption allowed us to estimate, from the heart rate recorded in free-swimming fish, the entire range of metabolic responses that cod underwent voluntarily while experiencing a thermally stratified water column, The most profound metabolic effect, however, was observed with feeding, when oxygen consumption increased by as much as 80%, resulting in an estimated 90% reduction in their subsequent scope for activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,JAN,1995,198,1,,,,,49,60,,,,,,,,,,,9317317,,,,,WOS:A1995QD18400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the causes for such daily chemical variations are not fully understood. We carried out laboratory culture experiments to investigate the effect of varying temperatures and light levels on organism physiology and shell geochemistry of the giant clam Tridacna crocea at daily time-resolution. We find that both temperature and light strongly influence shell growth rates. Besides demonstrating light enhanced calcification, we also observe growth inhibition during culture in continuous darkness. 'Ultra-high resolution' LA-ICP-MS analysis (Warter and Miller, 2017) in tandem with Ba-135-labelling allows both to identify newly secreted, cultured aragonite and investigate its trace elemental composition at (sub)daily resolution (B/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca). Overall, average Element/Calcium (El/Ca) ratios reveal an inverse relation with temperature and light. Strikingly, an increasing trend in all El/Ca ratios is observed in the direction of shell growth, which is interpreted to be metabolically-controlled, possibly related to organism 'stress'. Daily, cyclic trace element variability can be clearly resolved at similar to 5-15 mu m in relatively fast growing shells, which experienced a diurnal light cycle but constant temperatures. We conclude that light (but not temperature) is the primary controlling factor responsible for daily trace element variability. We further demonstrate that high El/Ca ratios correspond to growth during night time, i.e. low light intensities, corroborating field observations by Sano et al. (2012). Yet, because light levels were kept constant during night and day, respectively, light intensity cannot account for the entire range of the El/Ca variability. We hypothesize that Tridacna physiology and biochemistry is controlled by a circadian rhythm, initiated by the external factor light, but endogenously mediated by the giant clam and/or its photosynthetic symbionts.",,,,,,"Muller, Wolfgang/0000-0001-5368-8011",,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-0182,1872-616X,,,,MAY 1,2018,496,,,,,,32,47,,10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.038,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.12.038,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000428973000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because thermal performance curves are non-linear, mean performance can differ in fluctuating and constant thermal environments. However, time-dependent effects - effects of the order and duration of exposure to temperature - can also influence mean performance. We quantified the non-linear and time-dependent effects of diurnally fluctuating temperatures for larval growth rates in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta L., with four main results. First, the shape of the thermal performance curve for growth rate depended on the duration of exposure: for example, optimal temperature and thermal breadth were greater for growth rates measured over short (24 h during the last instar) compared with long (the entire period of larval growth) time periods. Second, larvae reared in diurnally fluctuating temperatures had significantly higher optimal temperatures and maximal growth rates than larvae reared in constant temperatures. Third, for larvae maintained at three mean temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and three diurnal temperature ranges (+/- 0, +/- 5 and +/- 10 degrees C), diurnal fluctuations had opposite effects on mean growth rates at low versus high mean temperature. Fourth, both short-and long-term thermal performance curves yielded poor predictions of the non-linear effects of fluctuating temperature on mean growth rates (compared with our experimental results) at higher mean temperatures.

An increase in mean daily temperature above 25 degrees C has been shown to have a negative effect on fruit dry weight, and to produce a linear decrease both in fruit oil concentration and oleic acid proportion in the oil over the range of 16-32 degrees C. Under natural conditions or in experiments in which mean daily temperatures are manipulated following the natural daily oscillation in temperature, mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures covary with mean daily temperature. However, variations in temperature associated with altitude, location and climate change can affect maximum and minimum temperatures differently and modify thermal amplitude. The objectives of the present study were to assess associations between changes in: i) yield variables (fruit dry weight and oil concentration) and ii) the proportions of major fatty acids in the oil, with the different dimensions of the daily temperature oscillation (mean daily minimum and maximum temperatures, mean daily thermal amplitude) experienced by the fruit during its growth from the pit-hardening stage to maturity. Five branch-level temperature treatments were applied: a control (TO) that followed the daily dynamics of ambient temperature, two levels of daytime (8-20 h) heating that increased temperature 5 and 10 degrees C relative to TO during the day, and two levels of nighttime (20-8 h) heating to 5 and 10 degrees C more than TO. Treatments were applied for 76 days during the oil accumulation phase using transparent chambers with individualized temperature control to enclose fruiting branches of cultivar Arauco trees. The treatments successfully broke the natural covariance between the different dimensions of daily temperature variation, and achieved a broad range in mean daily temperature (similar to 6 degrees C) which covered the natural range of this variable for the region. Fruit dry weight showed a tendency to decrease with increasing mean temperature, while the proportion of oil in the fruit exhibited a significant relationship (R-2 = 0.70) with mean daily thermal amplitude, and weaker but significant-ones with mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures. The proportion of the main fatty acid in the oil, oleic acid, showed significant negative associations with mean daily minimum temperature (R-2 = 0.45) and with mean daily temperature (R-2 = 0.32), and a significant curvilinear relationship with mean daily thermal amplitude, but was not significantly associated with mean maximum temperature. Mean daily thermal amplitude in our experiment was determined mainly by mean daily minimum temperatures, a feature also found in an analysis of meteorological data for five sites and five years in the olive producing areas of La Rioja province, Argentina. Our results highlight the need to broaden studies on the temperature responses of olive fruit size, oil content and oleic acid content of the oil to include the effects of minimum temperature and thermal amplitude.",,,,,,"Rousseaux, Maria Cecilia/0000-0001-8761-8839",,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-4238,1879-1018,,,,JAN 3,2018,227,,,,,,305,312,,10.1016/j.scienta.2017.09.030,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2017.09.030,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000414107700037,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its circadian or diurnal variation has not been extensively studied. The present study examined whether the CIZ is subject to a diurnal rhythm. In addition, according to the previous finding that the CIZ was proportionally correlated with peripheral interthreshold zone (PIZ), it was also examined whether cutaneous sensation threshold zone (CSZ), a determinant of the PIZ, is correlated with the CIZ. Methods: The CIZ and the CSZ were measured in ten Japanese men who underwent three experiments in a single day on the morning, afternoon, and evening in the 2014 experiment (so-called single-day experiment) and six Japanese men underwent the same experiments on the morning of day 1, the afternoon of day 2, and the evening of day 3 in the 2015 experiment (so-called multiple-day experiment). Air temperature was controlled at 20-24 degrees C.Each subject wore a suit perfused with 25 C water at a rate of 600 cm(3)/min and exercised on an ergometer at 50% of their maximum work rate for 10-15 min until their rate of sweating increased. They then remained seated without exercising until their oxygen uptake increased. Rectal temperature, skin temperatures at seven sites, the sweating rate at the forehead, and oxygen uptake were continuously monitored throughout experiment. Cutaneous warm and cold sensation thresholds at three sites were measured using 1- and 2-cm(2) probes. Results: The results from the single-day experiment demonstrated a small change in the CIZ and core temperature prior to exercise (Tc-init) whereas those from the multiple-day experiment demonstrated continuous increase in the CIZ and Tc-init. The CSZ measured with a 1-cm(2) probe was inversely proportional to the average skin temperature at three sites prior to measurement (Tsk-av).

The analysis provides a mechanistic explanation for the decreased amplitude of daily cycles in T-b and the increase in 'average' T-b with increasing mass. Assessments of 'average' daily T-b were made by dividing the integral of the difference between measured values of T-b and minimum operative temperature by the period of integration, to yield a thermal index expressing relative 'warmth' of crocodiles. The average daily T-b of a 1010 kg crocodile was 3.7 degrees C warmer than that of a 42 kg individual in summer and 1.9 degrees C warmer than that of a 32 kg individual in winter. The success of this mathematical approach confirms that crocodiles are simple ectotherms and that there is unlikely to be a significant contribution to their thermal biology from physiological mechanisms. Behaviour, however, is very important even in large individuals. Crocodiles in the field typically move daily between land and water in cycles that vary seasonally. We predicted T-b for the reverse of these behavioural cycles, which more than doubled seasonal fluctuations in T-b compared with the observed fluctuations. We were also able to predict the T-b of very large, dinosaur-sized crocodiles in a similar climate to that at our study site. A 10000 kg 'crocodile', for example, would be expected to have a T-b of 31 degrees C in winter, varying by less than 0.1 degrees C during a day when operative temperatures varied by nearly 20 degrees C, from 20 to 38 degrees C. The study confirms that, in low latitudes at least, large dinosaurs must have had an essentially high and stable value of T-b, without any need for endothermy. Also, access to shade or water must have been crucial for the survival of large dinosaurs at low latitudes. Furthermore, the finding of increasing 'average' T-b as ectotherms grow larger may have implications for the metabolic rates of very large reptiles, because the Q(10) effect could counteract the downscaling of metabolic rate with mass, an effect that seems not to have been recognised previously.",,,,,,"Seebacher, Frank/0000-0002-2281-9311",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,JAN,1999,202,1,,,,,77,86,,,,,,,,,,,9841897,,,,,WOS:000078363300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

An explanation is based on the effect of stream temperature on the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed, which can be expected to double in the 0 degrees to 25 degrees C temperature range. Results are presented for field experiments in which stream discharge and temperature were continuously measured for several days over losing reaches at St. Kevin Gulch Colorado, and Tijeras Arroyo, New Mexico. At St. Kevin Gulch in July 1991, the diurnal stream temperature in the 160-m study reach ranged from about 4 degrees to 18 degrees C, discharges ranged from 10 to 18 L/s, and streamflow loss in the study reach ranged from 2.7 to 3.7 L/s. On the basis of measured stream temperature variations, the predicted change in conductivity was about 38%; the measured change in stream loss was about 26%, suggesting that streambed temperature varied less than the stream temperature. At Tijeras Arroyo in May 1992, diurnal stream temperature in the 655-m study reach ranged from about 10 degrees to 25 degrees C and discharge ranged from 25 to 55 L/s. Streamflow loss was converted to infiltration rates by factoring in the changing stream reach surface area and streamflow losses due to evaporation rates as measured in a hemispherical evaporation chamber. Infiltration rates ranged from about 0.7 to 2.0 m/d, depending on time and location. Based on measured stream temperature variations, the predicted change in conductivity was 29%; the measured change in infiltration was also about 27%. This suggests that high infiltration rates cause rapid convection of heat to the streambed. Evapotranspiration losses were estimated for the reach and adjacent flood plain within the arroyo. On the basis of these estimates, only about 5% of flow loss was consumed via stream evaporation and stream-side evapotranspiration, indicating that 95% of the loss within the study reach represented groundwater recharge.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,,,,,DEC,1994,30,12,,,,,3253,3264,,10.1029/94WR01968,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94WR01968,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PU14200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data regarding the bioenergetics of the lugworm larval stages are still incomplete. Trochophore is initially lecithotroph and then becomes planktotroph while growing as metatrochophore on subtidal area, a quite stable daily temperature environment compared with the foreshore, where juveniles and adult live, with daily temperature fluctuating up to 15 degrees C. These discrepancies in temperature ranges may influence the temperature corrections (TCs) that control metabolic rates during the life cycle of A. marina. We carried out laboratory experiments in microcosms by inducing artificial spawning of lugworms, and then undertaken in vitro fertilization to obtain embryos and, finally, to follow, the larval development up to 10 segments with chaetae for 50 days under three temperature conditions (13 degrees C, 15 degrees C and 17 degrees C) and two food conditions ('fed'and 'non-fed').

To account for this, a mathematical model has been developed on the assumption that hatchling sex depends on the daily proportion of embryonic development that occurs above the threshold temperature for sex determination rather than the proportion of time spent above the threshold. The model predictions are borne out by experiments using the marine turtle Caretta caretta. Average developmental rates, both overall and during the period that sexual differentiation is sensitive to temperature, are unaffected by diel fluctuations about the mean incubation temperature. Sex ratios, on the other hand, were affected by diel fluctuations and ranged from ca. 100% males under regimes 26 +/- 0 degrees C and 26 +/- 3 degrees C to 100% females for regimes 26 +/- 7 degrees C and 26 +/- 8 degrees C. These and intermediate sex ratios were in close agreement with model predictions. Demonstration of an impact of temperature on sex, while holding overall developmental rate constant, gives support to hypotheses invoking a direct role for temperature rather than alternative hypotheses invoking overall developmental rate as a more proximal influence on sex. The model explains why mean temperature is a poor predictor of hatchling sex ratios. It; urges caution in using ''hours above the threshold'' for predicting sex ratios, because 1 hr at 1 degrees C above the threshold will not be equivalent to 1 hr at 4 degrees C above the threshold. It provides a general framework for integrating experiments at constant temperatures with those in the field or laboratory using fluctuating regimes. It provides greater scope for exploring how reptiles with temperature dependent sex determination might respond to climatic change or other disturbances to the incubation environment. And it provides an explanation of why secondary factors such a hydric conditions and oxygen potentials might influence hatchling sex, even if temperature acts directly to influence sex ratios rather than through its influence on overall developmental rate.

The animals were subjected to a nychthemeral range of air temperature that often exceeded 20 degrees C, with an absolute minimum temperature of -6 degrees C and a maximum of 34 degrees C. Abdominal temperature exhibited a low amplitude (similar to 1.2 degrees C) nychthemeral rhythm, with a temperature peak near sunset and a trough shortly after sunrise. The amplitude of the nychthemeral rhythm of body temperature was not correlated with the 24 h range of air temperature. Although mean 24 h body temperatures were positively correlated with corresponding air temperatures, mean daily body temperature increased, on average, by only 0.02 degrees C per 1 degrees C increase in air temperature, so that it was only similar to 0.3 degrees C higher in summer than in winter. Mean monthly body temperatures were strongly positively correlated with photoperiod and, in parallel with changes in the time of sunrise, the times at which the minimum and maximum body temperatures occurred were shifted similar to 1.2 h earlier in summer than in winter. Annual and daily variations in body temperature of springbok, like those of other free-living African ungulates, therefore appear to reflect an endogenous rhythm, entrained by the light:dark cycle, but largely independent of fluctuations in the environmental thermal load.

Diagnoses indicate that the DTR in the CLLH shows a significant positive correlation with the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and a negative correlation with the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). When a strengthened ISM occurs with a weakened EASM, an anomalous anticyclonic circulation with downward motion is excited over the CLLH. This anomalous circulation pattern increases the DTR in the rainy season by reducing the medium and high cloud cover in the CLLH. A weakened ISM with a strengthened EASM decreases the DTR over the CLLH in the rainy season. Numerical experiments help to verify this crucial physical process linking the variability of the ISM and EASM with the DTR in the CLLH.

Two types of buildings are investigated: hollow model means hollow concrete buildings and water model filled with water. Direct solar radiation, wall height, and wall orientation are significant factors that affect the diurnal variations of air-wall surface temperatures. The wall temperature shows a common declining trend from the upper heights to the lower heights. The water model experiences a smaller mean daily temperature range (DTR) of about 10 degrees C than the hollow model (mean DTR = 15.5 degrees C) due to heat storage. Moreover, 50%similar to 60% net radiation (Q*) are partitioned into heat storage (estimated by the element surface temperature method) for the water model, which is about two times for the hollow model between 10:00 to 16:00.

We tested the impact of warming with DTR change on seed germination and seedling growth of eight species in the family Asteraceae. Four of these are invasive (Eupatorium catarium, Mikania micrantha, Biodens pilosa var. radiate, Ageratum conyzoides) in China, and four are native (Sonchus arvensis, Senecios candens, Pterocypsela indica, Eupatorium fortunei). Four temperature treatments were set in growth chambers (three warming by 3 degrees C with different DTRs and control), and experiments were run to mimic wintertime and summertime conditions. The control treatment (T-c) was set to the mean temperature for the corresponding time of year, and the three warming treatments were symmetric (i.e. equal night-and-day) (DTRsym), asymmetric warming with increased (DTRinc) and decreased (DTRdec) DTR. The warming treatments did not affect seed germination of invasive species under any of the conditions, but DTRsym and DTRinc increased seed germination of natives relative to the control, suggesting that warming may not increase success of these invasive plant species via effects on seed germination of invasive plants relative to native plants. The invasive plants had higher biomass and greater stem allocation than the native ones under all of the warming treatments. Wintertime warming increased the biomass of the invasive and wintertime DTRsym and DTRinc increased that of the native plants, whereas summertime asymmetric warming decreased the biomass of the invasives but not the natives. Therefore, warming may not facilitate invasion of these invasive species due to the suppressive effects of summertime warming (particularly the asymmetric warming) on growth. Compared with DTRsym, DTRdec decreased the biomass of both the invasive and native plants, while the asymmetric summer warming treatments (DTRinc and DTRdec) decreased the biomass of the invasive but not the native plants. In addition, wintertime DTRinc did not enhance the biomass of all the plants relative to DTRsym. Our results were obtained in an unrealistic setting; the growth conditions in chambers (e.g. low light, low herbivory, no competition) are quite different from natural conditions (high light, normal herbivory and competition), which may influence the effects of warming on the seedling establishment and growth of both invasive and native plants. Nonetheless, our work highlights the importance of asymmetric warming, particularly in regards to the comparison with the effects of symmetric warming on both invasive and native plants. Conclusions regarding the effects of future warming should be made cautiously because warming with different DTRs may suggest different implications for invasion, and effects of warming may be different in different seasons.",,,,,"Chen, Bao-Ming/H-9024-2016","Chen, Bao-Ming/0000-0003-1891-8752",,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-2851,,,,,,2017,9,,,,,,,,plx028,10.1093/aobpla/plx028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aobpla/plx028,,,,,,,,28775830,,,,,WOS:000410143600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

An understanding of the upper thermal tolerance of Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout is important for developing water temperature standards and for assessing suitable habitat for reintroduction and management. Hatch success of Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout eggs was determined under static temperatures. The thermal requirements of fry and juveniles were also assessed under static and fluctuating temperature regimes using the acclimated chronic exposure method. Egg hatch success was 46-70% from 6 degrees C to 16 degrees C but declined significantly at 18 degrees C and 20 degrees C. Maximum growth of fry that were fed to satiation occurred at 15.3 degrees C. The 30-d ultimate upper incipient lethal temperature (UUILT) was 22.6 degrees C for fry and 21.7 degrees C for juveniles. Survival during fluctuating temperature experiments was dependent upon the daily maximum temperature and the daily fluctuation. The upper thermal limits for Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout were lower than those of Rainbow Trout O. mykiss but similar to those of other Cutthroat Trout subspecies. The low UUILT of Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout relative to some salmonids may increase the risk of deleterious effects brought about by a changing climate, habitat alteration, and sympatric nonnative salmonids, which are known to outcompete Cutthroat Trout at temperatures above the species' optimal range. Daily mean water temperatures near the Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout's optimal growth temperature of 15 degrees C would be suitable for reintroduction of this subspecies. Depending on the daily temperature fluctuation, daily maximum temperatures within reintroduction streams and current habitat should remain at or below 25 degrees C to ensure long-term persistence of a Rio Grande Cutthroat Trout population. This information will aid in establishing water quality standards to protect habitat where the subspecies currently occurs.

Potato is a secondary host of the species but the major threat from this insect in the Andean region for potato is the transmission by this insect of a crinivirus causing Potato yellow vein disease. Determination of the pest's temperature-dependent population growth potential is crucial knowledge for understanding the population dynamics and spread potential of the species and the diseases it can transmit, as well as for designing effective pest management strategies. Trialeurodes vaporariorum development, mortality and reproduction were studied at seven constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 32 degrees C. The Insect Life Cycle Modeling (ILCYM) software was used to fit nonlinear equations to the data and establish an overall phenology model to simulate life-table parameters based on temperature. In addition, life tables of T. vaporarionum were established at daily fluctuating temperature in two different environments: Cusco (5 degrees C-35 degrees C) and La Molina, Lima (13.7 degrees C-24.9 degrees C), and used to adjust and validate the model. The insect only completed its life cycle at constant temperatures above 15 degrees C and below 32 degrees C although the cycle was completed at daily fluctuating temperatures between 5 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The overall model portrayed population development within the temperature range of 14 degrees to 32 degrees C with a maximum finite rate of population increase (= 1.14) at 23 degrees C. However, the model revealed poor convergence with life tables established at fluctuating temperatures indicating an influential effect of temperature fluctuations on the whitefly life history parameters, particularly on adult survival time and reproduction. Therefore, we adjusted the model for convergence with a single life table observed at fluctuating temperature. The adjusted model gave good predictions when compared with remaining observed life tables and published data. The adjusted model predicted population development within the temperature range of 11.5 degrees C-35.5 degrees C, and maximum population growth at around 24 degrees C with a finite rate of increase, lambda, of 1.137 and a population doubling time of 5 days. The established process-based physiological model presented here for T. vaporariorum can be used for predicting the species distribution potential based on temperature worldwide and should prove helpful in adjusting pest management measures.

Each experiment consisted of a 1-wk acclimation under thermoneutrality (TN) (T-a = T-w = 21 C), a 4-wk heat exposure or treatment period, and a 2-wk recovery under TN. Each experiment involved 24 individually caged hens at the initial age of 29 wk (Experiment 1) or 30 wk (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, T-w of 18 or 27 C was provided to 12 birds per T-w regimen under a diurnal T-a of 27 to 35 C (daily mean of 31 C). In Experiment 2, T-w of 15, 19, 23, or 27 C was provided to six birds per T-w regimen under a diurnal T-a of 27 to 38 C (daily mean of 32.5 C). Experiment 1 showed that T-w of 18 C enhanced hourly and daily feed and water intake during the first 2 wk of heat exposure, as compared with T-w of 27 C. Experiment 2 showed that daily feed and water intake were greatest for hens in the 23 C Tw regimen and least for hens in the coolest or warmest T-w regimens. Reduction in daily feed intake with increase in daily mean T-a ranged from 2.0 similar to 3.2 g/C-day (first week of heat exposure) to 1.1 similar to 1.9 g/C-day (fourth week of heat exposure). Water to feed intake ratio was 1.8 similar to 2.0 during acclimation and recovery, but increased to 3.0 similar to 3.4 during heat exposure. Internal egg quality parameters were in general unaffected by T-w. The two warmer T-w regimens in Experiment 2 had less reduction in egg size than did the two cooler T-w. In both experiments, hens displayed anticipatory increase in feed and water intake 2 to 3 h prior to lights-off. However, the stimulus of lights-on did not elicit a strong return to feed and water consumption as typically seen in broilers. The results revealed the potential existence of an optimal T-w range (near 23 C) for heat-challenged laying hens.

The avoidance of high ambient temperatures is a behavioral mechanism used by homeothermic animals living in extreme environmental conditions. As the circadian system is involved in these thermoregulatory responses, precise phase shifts and even complete temporal niche inversion have been reported. Octodon degus, a mainly diurnal rodent from Chile, has the ability to switch its phase preference for locomotor activity to coincide with the availability of a running wheel. The aims of this work are twofold: to determine whether ambient temperature cycles, with high values during the day and low values at night (HLTa), can induce nocturnal chronotypes in degus previously characterized as diurnal; and to learn whether HLTa cycles are able to act as a zeitgeber in this dual-phase species. To this end, degus were subjected to 24 h HLTa cycles under both 12:12 LD and DD conditions. Two experimental groups were used, one with previous wheel running experience and another naive group, to study the influence of the thermal cycles and previous wheel running experience on the degus' dual-phasing behavior. Temperature cycles (31.3 +/- 1.5 degrees C during the day and 24.2 +/- 1.6 degrees C at night) induced a 100% nocturnalism in previously diurnal individuals. Indeed, both entrainment with nocturnal phase angle to LD and nocturnal rhythmicity induced by masking were observed. Moreover, HLTa cycles acted by masking, confining wheel-running activity to the cooler phase under DD conditions, with the naive group being more sensitive than the experienced one.

[O-3] was also measured with passive diffusion samplers at two other sites. Both the diurnal temperature range (DTR) and the diurnal [O-3] range (DOR) were to a large extent explained by the strength of the nocturnal temperature inversions at the sites. To investigate the influence of topography, the relative altitude of the sites was defined as the average altitude within a 3 km radius subtracted from the altitude of the site.

Normally supply exceeds demand in cool temperatures, while the opposite is true at warm temperatures. To match supply and demand, photosynthesis is inhibited in the cool temperature range and synthesis (growth) is inhibited in the warm temperature range. The signal for the supply-demand imbalance is presumably obtained from the state of the carbohydrate pool (temporary storage), which fluctuates between a maximum level around sunset and a minimum level around dawn. A simple model, that incorporates this presumed mechanism, is presented and used to estimate the response of structural growth and of carbohydrate content to light and temperature in the cool and warm temperature ranges. The model predicts maximum growth rate at an intermediate temperature, which is positively correlated with light level. It also predicts an increase of nonstructural carbohydrate at cool temperatures. Both predictions are in qualitative agreement with observations.

This paper reports observed changes in air temperature, soil temperature and soil-moisture content under experimental warming and clipping in a tallgrass prairie in the Great Plains, USA. We used a factorial design with warming as the primary factor nested with clipping as the secondary factor. Infrared heater was used in order to simulate climatic warming and clipping to mimic mowing for hay or grazing. The warming treatment significantly increased daily mean and minimum air temperatures by 1.1 and 2.3 degreesC, respectively, but had no effect on daily maximum air temperature, resulting in reduced diurnal air-temperature range.

The uncertainty is due to the challenge and dearth of in situ measurements. Recent work in a subtropical stream system has shown the potential for diurnal variability to influence the downstream N transfer, N form, and estimates of in-stream N2O production. Studies in temperate stream systems have also shown diurnal changes in stream chemistry. The objectives of this study were to measure N2O fluxes and dissolved N2O concentrations from a spring-fed temperate river to determine if diurnal cycles were occurring. The study was performed during a 72 h period, over a 180 m reach, using headspace chamber methodology. Significant diurnal cycles were observed in radiation, river temperature and chemistry including dissolved N2O-N concentrations. These data were used to further assess the IPCC methodology and experimental methodology used. River NO3-N and N2O-N concentrations averaged 3.0 mg L-1 and 1.6 mu g L-1, respectively, with N2O saturation reaching a maximum of 664%. The N2O-N fluxes, measured using chamber methodology, ranged from 52 to 140 mu g m(-2) h(-1) while fluxes predicted using the dissolved N2O concentration ranged from 13 to 25 mu g m(-2) h(-1). The headspace chamber methodology may have enhanced the measured N2O flux and this is discussed. Diurnal cycles in N2O% saturation were not large enough to influence downstream N transfer or N form with variability in measured N2O fluxes greater and more significant than diurnal variability in N2O% saturation. The measured N2O fluxes, extrapolated over the study reach area, represented only 6 x 10(-4)% of the NO3-N that passed through the study reach over a 72 h period. This is only 0.1% of the IPCC calculated flux.",,,,,"Brown, Barbara/J-3269-2012; Clough, Timothy/Q-4982-2018","Clough, Timothy/0000-0002-5978-5274",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,MAY,2007,13,5,,,,,1016,1027,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01337.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01337.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000245987300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The fractional coverage of cold cloudiness, as determined from various IR brightness temperature thresholds, has been used as a proxy for tropical convective precipitation, as direct observations of rainfall are unavailable for much of the earth, especially over the oceans. Variations in fractional coverage of cold cloud for three different temperature thresholds are examined: 235, 225, and 215 K. The results of this study indicate that cold cloud is most frequently observed over land between 1800 and 2100 local time and is independent of the temperature threshold used. Over the tropical oceans, however, the time of maximum occurrence of cold cloud varies substantially with the temperature threshold employed. Coldest cloud-top temperatures (< 215 K) are found to occur much earlier in the day than warmer cloud tops and peak between 0300 and 0600 local time, which is consistent with many earlier limited-area studies. This observation is further confirmed from precipitation intensity differences between morning and evening observations from microwave satellite data. An interesting out-of-phase relationship between oceanic and continental convection is also discussed. Ship reports of weather type from the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set are examined as are hourly rainfall amounts from optical rain gauges on moored buoys that were deployed for the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment. Both of these data sources also indicate the preference for predawn oceanic heavy rainfall and convective activity. A cursory examination of the diurnal variations in short-range (6 h) rainfall forecasts from the National Meteorological Center Medium-Range Forecast Model are compared with the satellite and in situ results. The daily variations of these forecasts, which are made four times daily, indicate that the diurnal behavior of the model is in reasonable agreement with that of the satellite and in situ observations.",,,,,"Arkin, Phillip/F-5808-2010","Arkin, Phillip/0000-0002-5769-7107",,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-0644,,,,,OCT,1994,122,10,,,,,2296,2311,,10.1175/1520-0493(1994)122<2296:AEOTDC>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1994)122<2296:AEOTDC>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PG58000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Commercially available fluctuating-temperature chambers are large and costly. This poses a challenge to experimental ecologists endeavouring to recreate natural temperature cycles in the laboratory because the large number of commercial chambers required for replicated study designs is prohibitively expensive to purchase, requires a large amount of space and consumes a great deal of energy. 2. We developed and validated a design for economical, programmable fluctuating-temperature chambers based on a relatively small (23 L) commercially manufactured constant temperature chamber ($140US) modified with a customized, user-friendly microcontroller ($15US). 3. Over a 1-week trial, these chambers reliably reproduced a real-world fluctuating (13.1-35.5 degrees C) body temperature regime of an individual frog, with a near-perfect 1 : 1 fit between target and actual temperatures (y = 1.0036x + 0.1366, R-2 = 0.9977, 95% confidence interval for slope = 1.0026, 1.0046). Over 30-day trials, they also reliably produced a simpler daily fluctuating-temperature scheme (sine wave fluctuating between 10 and 25 degrees C each 24 h) and a range of constant temperature regimes. 4. The design is inexpensive and simple to assemble in large numbers, enabling genuine replication of even highly complex, many treatment study designs. For example, it is possible to simultaneously examine in replicate chambers the responses of organisms to constant regimes, regimes that fluctuate following the means experienced by populations and regimes that exactly mimic fluctuations measured over any length of time for particular individuals that differ in behaviour or microhabitat use. These chambers thus vastly expand the pool of resources available for manipulative experiments in thermal biology and ecology.",,,,,"Alford, Ross A/H-1577-2011; Greenspan, Sasha E/L-2584-2014; Schwarzkopf, Lin/C-1242-2012","Alford, Ross A/0000-0002-3010-6768; Greenspan, Sasha E/0000-0001-8883-2968; Schwarzkopf, Lin/0000-0002-1009-670X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,DEC,2016,7,12,,,,,1567,1574,,10.1111/2041-210X.12619,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12619,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000390408700015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we evaluate the diurnal cycle of precipitation and organized convection as a function of resolution. For validation we use the TRMM 3B42 and IMERG precipitation products and 4 km merged infrared brightness temperature, focusing on three regions: the contiguous United States (CONUS), the Maritime Continent, and Amazonia. We find that higher resolution has mixed impacts on the diurnal phase. Regions dominated by non-local propagating convection show the greatest improvement, with better representation of organized convective systems. Precipitation in regions dominated by local thermodynamic forcing tends to peak too early at high resolution. Diurnal amplitudes in all regions develop unrealistic small-scale variability at high resolution, while amplitudes tend to be underestimated at low resolution. The GEOS model uses the Grell-Freitas scale-aware convection scheme, which smoothly reduces parameterized deep convection with increasing resolution. We find that some parameterized convection is beneficial for the diurnal amplitude and phase even with a 3.5 km model grid, but only when throttled with the scale-aware approach.

Diurnal courses of lichen gas exchange response were recorded over five-day periods during the arctic summer and fall (from July to early September 1988 and 1989). Water availability is the environmental factor of foremost importance in determining rates of primary production. Water sources were rain, fog, and dew fall, as well as high air humidity, which alone could reactivate most of the green algal species after desiccation. Despite high variability in environmental conditions, certain patterns in the diurnal course of thallus hydration occurred repeatedly, so that five different weather types were defined within which gas exchange performance was predictable. Even short periods of favourable hydration were used by lichens for positive net photosynthesis (NP). There was no indication of adverse consequences of ''resaturation respiration''. Even after a dry period of 3 days, sudden rehydration resulted in carbon gain without delay. For short periods of time, the combinations of water content, temperature and light imposed on the lichens enables high rates of NP. Individual species differed greatly in their maximal NP rate, which correlated with chlorophyll and nitrogen content. At favourable times in the field, observed NP rates approached the maximum capacity found in laboratory experiments at natural ambient CO2. Often with sufficient hydration, carbon gain was limited by light. CO2 exchange became negative even during daylight hours due to the effects of fog and clouds with light below compensation levels. Reduced but still positive rates of NP were observed with snow and with frozen lichens. In order to draw general conclusions about activity over the summer season, the time was calculated for a characteristic set of sampling days during which thalli were inactivated due to dehydration (no CO2 exchange measurable), during which they photosynthetically fixed CO2, and during which CO2 was released. The thalli were inactivated on the average 42.5% of the time. Species-specific differences with respect to the total period of dehydration were surprisingly small (from 39.0% for Stereocaulon alpinum to 45.5% for Cetraria cucullata). Thus, growth-form specific morphology and anatomy of the samples, which were exposed side-by-side at the same site did not result in large differences in active phases. On the other hand, differences in physiological traits between species result in varying division of active phases with respect to positive and negative NP. For example, Dactylina arctica photosynthesized 1.36 times longer than Peltigera malacea. Other traits tend to offset the negative effect of long periods with respiratory CO2 release. As a result, the cyanobacterial lichen Peltigera malacea with the shortest total period of positive NP was, nevertheless, the most productive species due to its high photosynthetic capacity. Our field observations strengthen the viewpoint that studies of lichen physiological differentiation are essential for understanding species autecology and that approaches based on interpretation of morphological attributes may sometimes be exaggerated in their importance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0367-2530,,,,,APR,1993,188,1,,,,,125,143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LC48100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, our aim was to investigate physiological and behavioural strategies employed by the fruit bat Nyctimene robinsoni(body mass similar to 50 g) in winter in tropical Northern Queensland in relation to ambient temperature (T-a) and the lunar cycle. Daily body temperature (T-b) fluctuations in free-ranging bats were measured via radio-telemetry and metabolic rate was measured in captivity via open-flow respirometry (T-a 15-30 degrees C). Free-ranging bats showed a significant 24 h circadian cycle in T-b, with the lowest T-b at the end of the rest phase just after sunset and the highest T-b at the end of the activity phase just before sunrise. Average daily core T-b ranged from 34.7 +/- 0.6 to 37.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C (mean +/- s.d.) over an average daily T-a range of 17.1 +/- 1.1 to 23.5 +/- 1.8 degrees C. T-b never fell below 30 degrees C but T-b was significantly reduced during the full moon period compared with that during the new moon period. T-b was correlated with T-a during the second half of the rest phase (P < 0.001) but not during the active phase. Resting metabolic rate of bats was significantly affected by T-a (P < 0.001, R-2 = 0.856). Our results show that tube-nosed bats exhibit reduced T-b on moonlit nights when they reduce foraging activity, but during our study torpor was not expressed.

Temperature time series data acquired along vertical profiles in the streambed have been applied to simple analytical models to determine rates of vertical fluid flux. These models are based on the downward propagation characteristics (amplitude attenuation and phase-lag) of the surface diurnal signal. Despite the popularity of these models, there are few published characterizations of moderate-to-strong upwelling. We attribute this limitation to the thermodynamics of upwelling, under which the downward conductive signal transport from the streambed interface occurs opposite the upward advective fluid flux. Governing equations describing the advection-diffusion of heat within the streambed predict that under upwelling conditions, signal amplitude attenuation will increase, but, counterintuitively, phase-lag will decrease. Therefore the extinction (measurable) depth of the diurnal signal is very shallow, but phase lag is also short, yielding low signal to noise ratio and poor model sensitivity. Conversely, amplitude attenuation over similar sensor spacing is strong, yielding greater potential model sensitivity. Here we present streambed thermal time series over a range of moderate to strong upwelling sites in the Quash-net River, Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The predicted inverse relationship between phase-lag and rate of upwelling was observed in the field data over a range of conditions, but the observed phase-lags were consistently shorter than predicted. Analytical solutions for fluid flux based on signal amplitude attenuation return results consistent with numerical models and physical seepage meters, but the phase-lag analytical model results are generally unreasonable. Through numerical modeling we explore reasons why phase-lag may have been over-predicted by the analytical models, and develop guiding relations of diurnal temperature signal extinction depth based on stream diurnal signal amplitude, upwelling magnitude, and streambed thermal properties that will be useful in designing future experiments.

An infrared thermometer was used, that permits a contactless measurement of the average surface temperature of a patch around a measuring point. Temperature was measured in an array of selected plots every 45 min from dawn to sunset in a 20 m(2) study area along the rocky coast of Calafuria (NW Italy). During the experiment daily temperature in all plots was minimum at dawn and quickly reached its peak value shortly after sun culmination; subsequently, it underwent a small-gradient decrease until sunset. In connection with temporary sun-shading and wind gusts relevant short-term rock surface temperature fluctuations were recorded. Considering mean daily temperature in each plot, it proved to be positively correlated with distance from the shoreline. As regards daily temperature range, its amplitude progressively increased moving farther from the shoreline. The measuring points located where the rock is extensively covered by barnacles experience a temperature magnification effect, possibly due to a micro-greenhouse effect triggered by the production of carbon dioxide by this biota. The entity of measured daily temperature fluctuations is ca. one order of magnitude greater than air temperature fluctuations measured at the same elevation in the closest meteorological station. The results of this work highlight that the infrared thermometer is an effective tool to measure rock surface temperature along rocky coasts, capable of detecting temperature fluctuations more effectively than traditionally employed data loggers.

This paper shows that, when resolving the intra-daily air-sea interactions by coupling the atmospheric and oceanic model components once per hour, the simulated ENSO asymmetry is improved. The improvement is closely related to the simulated diurnal cycle of sea surface tempreature (SST). In the central tropical Pacific, the simulated diurnal range of SST is about 0.2 degrees C, up to 10% of SST anomalies of the simulated ENSO events. During El Nino events, the diurnal cycle of SST anomalies enhances the atmospheric moist instability, whereby triggering more convection in the central tropical Pacific. During La Nina and normal years, however, the mean convection is not changed by the included diurnal cycle of SST anomalies. As a result, the anomalies of the trades, which are directly related to the convection, are stronger during El Nino years than that during La Nina years, making El Nino to be stronger than La Nina via Bjerknes feedback. These results obtained with a low resolution MPI-ESM are further confirmed by simulation with the same model at higher spatial resolutions, suggesting that the role of the intra-daily air-sea interactions for the ENSO asymmetry is independent of model resolutions.",,,,,"Tian, Fangxing/ABF-3067-2021","Hertwig, Eileen/0000-0002-7853-7022",,,,,,,,,,,,,0930-7575,1432-0894,,,,FEB,2019,52,3-4,,,,,2399,2411,,10.1007/s00382-018-4271-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4271-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000460902200064,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wind speed and directions at the surface levels obtained from SOund Detection And Ranging (SODAR) and tower are compared and found, mostly SODAR measurements are consistent with tower during high wind conditions (greater than 4 ms(-1)) except under weak circumstances. Our analysis revealed that, the mean wind speed found to be a maximum (7.86 ms(-1)) during the monsoon season in the air layer between 10 m and 200 m level and shows a sharp increase near to the surface (at 20 m level). Analysis also depicts seasonal variations in wind speed are predominant in the lower boundary layer and it is closely linked to the large-scale flow patterns/disturbances. The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) was found to be maximum at 165 m (0.62 m(2)s(-2)) during the pre-monsoon due to enhanced surface heating. The 93% and 75% of the wind speed profiles exhibited unstable conditions in the monsoon and post monsoon conditions. Moreover, the unstable layers are characterized by high wind speed and temperature structure function (C-T(2)) in day time. On large scale, the wind speed gets strengthened (reduced) in the wet (dry) spell in the lower levels with distinct diurnal cycle in the Indo Gangetic Plain. The advection of moisture in the nocturnal periods in connection with the wet spells in the near surface level is observed and the wind speeds in the daytime (above 150 m) are also found to be stronger in the range 3.5-5 ms(-1) in the dry spells due to the enhanced mixing. The diurnal cycle is more evident in the dry spells in the lower levels.

Our data collected in the Adriatic show that the pronounced diurnal upwelling is also possible under milder wind-forcing and outside critical latitudes. It is found that the thermocline recorded in the summer of 2006 at the south coast of the island of Lastovo was subject to diurnal variability with a maximum range of about 30 m, and that the corresponding currents measured off the west coast of the island pointed to internal waves propagating around the island in a clockwise direction. We suggest that the summertime stratification occasionally promotes coastal waves that revolve daily around the island, creating the conditions needed for resonant excitation by sea breezes. Numerical modeling reveals that the 24-h waves are trapped around the island due to the influence of both the Coriolis force and bottom slope, and that the 12-h waves radiate away from the island.

On Earth, permafrost microbial communities are subjected to wide ranges in temperature and are often active at subfreezing temperatures. The existence of active microbial communities within permafrost on Earth suggests that permafrost on Mars may constitute a habitable environment. Terrestrial microbial permafrost communities typically contain methane-producing Archaea, which is cause for concern as global temperatures rise, resulting in permafrost thaw and the release of the potent greenhouse gas. Similarly, on Mars, the overlap between patterned ground and detections of localized methane plumes suggest that the compound may have been released from thawing permafrost. Analyses of permafrost ice cores and soil samples on Earth note that (1) archaeal communities often contain both mesophiles and psychrophiles at different depths and (2) active methane is being produced at subfreezing temperatures over geological timescales. Thus, the purpose of the experiments described here was to determine the effect of extreme temperature changes (reminiscent of the martian diurnal temperature cycle) on the growth and survival of four non-psychrophilic methanogens previously used as models for potential life on Mars.

This study aimed to identify, the appropriate time interval for air sampling in order to quantify the mean daily CH4 emission rate, key information to future studies aiming the derivation of regional indexes of CH4 emission. Three campaigns were performed to evaluate diurnal variation in CH4 emissions (3h interval) from continuously flooded rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. 'IRGA-422 CL') fields at different crop stages (panicle differentiation and ripening) and management systems (conventional tillage-CT and no-tillage-NT) during 2002/2003 crop season in long-term experiment at the Instituto Rio Grandense do Arroz (IRGA), in Cachoeirinha, RS, Brazil. Static chamber method was used and the air samples collected with polystyrene syringes were analyzed by gas chromatography. Methane emission showed a same diurnal pattern in the three campaigns in the both tillage systems. The maximum range of emission (8-33mg CH(4)m(-2) h(-1)) was observed in the early afternoon (12.00 to 15.00p.m.) followed by a decline to a minimum around midnight to next morning (4-19mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), in which fluxes were related to flood water temperature (campaign 1 and 3) or soil temperature (campaign 2). Taking into account the daily emission curves, plus operational aspects like chromatographic analysis of samples into the 24h period after air sampling, the time interval from 9.00 to 12.00a.m. is recommended to studies aiming to evaluate mean daily CH4 emission in rice fields. The close relationship between temperature and methane emission allows its infer about the suitability of the gas sampling procedure for the different rice sub-regions of South of Brazil (littoral region and south of RS, and south of SC) that present the same daily behavior of solar radiation and air temperature.

The paper reports the presence of a distinct diurnal pattern in the total number of gamma-ray counts detected by the NaI detector. The counts start decreasing after sunrise and show gradual recovery after sunset. The amplitude of this variation is quite significant (>10%) at the observation site Tirunelveli, South India. However, further investigation based on different energy ranges reveals that the mentioned diurnal pattern is actually present only in the energies related to the terrestrial background radioactivity. The study demonstrates that the pattern is associated with the radioactivity of isotopes of radon (Rn-222 and Rn-220) and their daughter radionuclides. The amplitude of the diurnal variation is found to have seasonal dependence, with the lowest amplitude during June-October (similar to 2%), and highest in April-May months (similar to 14%). The dependence of the amplitude of the diurnal variation on various atmospheric parameters, namely temperature, relative humidity, and the vertical wind is examined. The observed diurnal pattern is attributed to the generation of the inversion layer. The distribution of concentration of radon and thoron progenies in an air column changes with the vertical mixing and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), resulting in the diurnal variation of gamma-rays. The observed lower amplitudes in the months of June-October may be due to the presence of downward winds restricting the radon movement to a thin layer, giving smaller amplitudes of the diurnal variation in total gamma-ray flux resulting in seasonal variation.",,,,,"Raghav, Anil Narayan/ABD-7880-2021; Bhaskar, Ankush/ABD-4129-2020","Raghav, Anil Narayan/0000-0002-4704-6706; Datar, Gauri/0000-0003-4971-6010",,,,,,,,,,,,,1364-6826,1879-1824,,,,OCT 1,2020,207,,,,,,,,105369,10.1016/j.jastp.2020.105369,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jastp.2020.105369,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000557761900018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The plant physiological and radiative impacts of CO2 on rainfall patterns over tropical forest regions are examined in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1.1 (E3SMv1.1-BGC) biogeochemistry experiments. Composite analysis reveals a dampening of the diurnal cycle of rainfall over the Amazon, Congo, and Maritime Continent in response to rising CO2 levels, regardless of the sign of total rainfall change. A full factorial model experiment confirms that the CO2 radiative and CO2 plant physiological effects can individually or jointly reduce the magnitude of the rainfall diurnal cycle, though the physical pathway giving rise to the reduction differs between the two effects. For the physiological response, stomatal closure reduces evapotranspiration, which dries the boundary layer and raises the lifting condensation level. These effects combine to reduce deep convective rainfall during its peak occurrence in the late daytime to early nighttime period. For the radiative response, a relative reduction in daytime Convective Available Potential Energy (consistent with a reduction in the diurnal temperature range) leads to less frequent triggering of deep convection and a reduction of rainfall diurnal amplitude. These diurnal rainfall changes are structurally similar across seasons, and show little sensitivity to representation of nutrient coupling for the land biogeochemistry.

Long-term data were derived from weekly grab samples (1984-2010) and high-frequency data from 7-hourly samples (2007-2009) both measured at two sites: a headwater stream draining moorland and a downstream site below plantation forest. This study is one of the first to analyse upland streamwater nitrate dynamics across such a wide range of timescales and report on the principal mechanisms identified. The data analysis provided no clear evidence that the long-term decline in streamwater nitrate concentrations was related to a decline in atmospheric deposition alone, because nitrogen deposition first increased and then decreased during the study period. Increased streamwater temperature and denitrification may also have contributed to the decline in stream nitrate concentrations, the former through increased N uptake rates and the latter resultant from increased dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Strong seasonal cycles, with concentration minimums in the summer, were driven by seasonal flow minimums and seasonal biological activity enhancing nitrate uptake. Complex diurnal dynamics were observed, with seasonal changes in phase and amplitude of the cycling, and the diurnal dynamics were variable along the river. At the moorland site, a regular daily cycle, with minimum concentrations in the early afternoon, corresponding with peak air temperatures, indicated the importance of instream biological processing. At the downstream site, the diurnal dynamics were a composite signal, resultant from advection, dispersion and nitrate processing in the soils of the lower catchment. The diurnal streamwater nitrate dynamics were also affected by drought conditions. Enhanced diurnal cycling in Spring 2007 was attributed to increased nitrate availability in the post-drought period as well as low flow rates and high temperatures over this period.

Arterial PO2 rose (89.73 vs. 77.91 mm Hg; P < 0.05) and bicarbonate levels declined (25.82 vs. 27.24 mmol/L; P < 0.05) in the DHS compared to C pigs, but no differences in pH, pCO(2) and base excess levels were observed between the two groups. Blood osmolality was lower (P < 0.05) in DHS than in C pigs (287.1 vs. 291.3 mOsmol/kg) over the 11-day study period. Diurnal heat-stressed pigs had lower urine pH at 0700 (6.065 vs. 6.599; P < 0.05) compared to C pigs. Diurnal heat-stressed pigs had higher (P < 0.05) urinary levels of titratable acid (22.84 vs. 14.95 mmol/L), net acid concentration (33.36 vs. 23.49 mmol/L), and ammonium (11.05 vs. 9.88 mmol/L) compared with C pigs at 0700 but not at 1430 and 1900. Plasma T4 and aldosterone levels were not affected by temperature (P > 0.05) but T3 levels were lower (16.19 vs. 23.46 ng/dL; P < 0.05) in DHS compared to C pigs. It was concluded that although the diurnal pattern of heat stress used in the current study had no effect on mineral metabolism in growing pigs, it altered the physiological status, including acid-base homeostasis, as well as the more obvious thermal homeostasis.

With this RCM ensemble, two idealized experiments are performed for Europe, one with a continent with maximized forest cover, and one in which all forests are turned into grassland. First, an in-depth analysis of one ensemble member (CCLM-VEG3D'') is carried out, to reveal the complex process chain caused by such land use changes (LUCs). From these findings, the whole ensemble is analyzed and principal biophysical effects of re/afforestation are derived. Results show that the diurnal temperature range is reduced at the surface (top of the vegetation) with re/afforestation. Most RCMs simulate colder surface temperatures T-surf during the day and warmer T-surf during the night. Thus, for the first time, the principal temperature interrelations found in observation-based studies in the midlatitudes could be reproduced within a model intercomparison study. On the contrary, the diurnal temperature range in the lowest atmospheric model level (T-air) is increased with re/afforestation. This opposing temperature response is mainly caused by the higher surface roughness of forest, enhancing the turbulent heat exchange. Furthermore, these opposing temperature responses demonstrate that the use of the diagnostic 2-m temperature (weighted interpolation between T-surf and T-air) has a limited potential to assess the effects of re/afforestation. Thus, studies about the biophysical impacts of LUCs should investigate the whole near-surface temperature profile.",,,,,"Cardoso, Rita M./A-1464-2013; Strada, Susanna/J-8649-2017; Tölle, Merja/E-4625-2013; Davin, Edouard L./L-7033-2016","Cardoso, Rita M./0000-0002-0259-6827; Strada, Susanna/0000-0001-7061-6263; Tölle, Merja/0000-0003-1958-2795; Davin, Edouard L./0000-0003-3322-9330; Jach, Lisa Lea/0000-0003-0130-9600; Sofiadis, Giannis/0000-0003-3360-0240",,,,,,,,,,,,,0894-8755,1520-0442,,,,NOV 1,2020,33,21,,,,,9159,9179,,10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0624.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0624.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000589811900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

R.",,,Do fluctuating temperature environments elevate coral thermal tolerance?,CORAL REEFS,,,,,,,,,,,,"In reef corals, much research has focused on the capacity of corals to acclimatize and/or adapt to different thermal environments, but the majority of work has focused on distinctions in mean temperature. Across small spatial scales, distinctions in daily temperature variation are common, but the role of such environmental variation in setting coral thermal tolerances has received little attention. Here, we take advantage of back-reef pools in American Samoa that differ in thermal variation to investigate the effects of thermally fluctuating environments on coral thermal tolerance. We experimentally heat-stressed Acropora hyacinthus from a thermally moderate lagoon pool (temp range 26.5-33.3A degrees C) and from a more thermally variable pool that naturally experiences 2-3 h high temperature events during summer low tides (temp range 25.0-35A degrees C). We compared mortality and photosystem II photochemical efficiency of colony fragments exposed to ambient temperatures (median: 28.0A degrees C) or elevated temperatures (median: 31.5A degrees C). In the heated treatment, moderate pool corals showed nearly 50% mortality whether they hosted heat-sensitive (49.2 +/- A 6.5% SE; C2) or heat-resistant (47.0 +/- A 11.2% SE; D) symbionts. However, variable pool corals, all of which hosted heat-resistant symbionts, survived well, showing low mortalities (16.6 +/- A 8.8% SE) statistically indistinguishable from controls held at ambient temperatures (5.1-8.3 +/- A 3.3-8.3% SE). Similarly, moderate pool corals hosting heat-sensitive algae showed rapid rates of decline in algal photosystem II photochemical efficiency in the elevated temperature treatment (slope = -0.04 day(-1) +/- A 0.007 SE); moderate pool corals hosting heat-resistant algae showed intermediate levels of decline (slope = -0.039 day(-1) +/- A 0.007 SE); and variable pool corals hosting heat-resistant algae showed the least decline (slope = -0.028 day(-1) +/- A 0.004 SE). High gene flow among pools suggests that these differences probably reflect coral acclimatization not local genetic adaptation. Our results suggest that previous exposure to an environmentally variable microhabitat adds substantially to coral-algal thermal tolerance, beyond that provided by heat-resistant symbionts alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0722-4028,1432-0975,,,,JUN,2011,30,2,,,,,429,440,,10.1007/s00338-011-0721-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-011-0721-y,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290327000019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thermal infrared spectra at two different temperatures between about 350 and 770 K were collected in order to simulate the typical diurnal equatorial temperature variation of the surface of Mercury. Such temperature increase (i.e. 420 K) modifies the olivine spectrum shifting in wavelength its emissivity features, simulating the spectrum of an olivine strongly enriched in iron (a Fa abundance increase from 8% to 23%). This chameleon-like behavior indicates that the spectroscopic investigations of the surface of Mercury must take into account the local solar time dependency to properly infer the compositions of planetary materials by remote sensing acquisition of future space missions.

Pods grown at Yelbeni, Western Australia, in 1996 were collected in December and placed on the soil surface or buried at a depth of 0.5 cm at a site near Perth. Other pods were subjected to a gradual diurnal temperature fluctuation of 60/15 degrees C in darkness in a laboratory chamber. Pod samples were taken from the field at intervals from January to June in 1997, and over 336 days from the 60/15 degrees C treatment. Pods were broken into segments and the number of soft seeds determined. Numbers of latent soft seeds were then determined by subjecting residual hard seeds to 7 gradual diurnal temperature cycles of 48/15 degrees C in darkness and retesting for permeability. In a second experiment, seeds preconditioned at the soil surface until 3 March were subjected to a range of light levels in the field in March before testing for permeability. The time taken for seeds to precondition under a range of constant temperatures between 30 degrees and 70 degrees C was determined in a third experiment. Preconditioning commenced early in summer in both surface and buried seeds. All buried seeds that preconditioned completed the softening process to produce about 80% soft seeds, with most seeds softening in March when diurnal temperatures fluctuated between maxima of 45-50 degrees C and minima of 10-20 degrees C. Only 15% of the seeds at the soil surface softened so that relatively few preconditioned seeds completed the softening process. Preconditioning occurred more rapidly than did the completion of softening in the 60/15 degrees C treatment, indicating that this temperature regime was above optimum for the final stage of softening. Reversal of the preconditioning process took place in the field as temperatures declined during May. Effects of reduced temperatures in causing this reversion were confirmed in the laboratory on seeds preconditioned at 60/15 degrees C. The final stage of softening was inhibited in some seeds by light levels as low as 0.3% of daylight, and in all seeds at a light level between 5 and 25%. A close negative linear relation was obtained between the log of the time taken for 50% of seeds to precondition and the constant temperature treatment between 30 degrees C and 70 degrees C, with the rate of preconditioning doubling with every 5.2 degrees C rise in temperature within this range. Although many seeds preconditioned at the soil surface, the main constraint to completion of the seed softening process during autumn was the inhibitory effect of light.",,,,,"Revell, Clinton/AAB-1212-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0004-9409,,,,,,1999,50,7,,,,,1203,1209,,10.1071/AR98206,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AR98206,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000082457000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mathematical functions developed in long-term laboratory experiments at different constant temperatures were combined with daily water temperatures for 1991 - 93 in eight Austrian streams and rivers to simulate the complex life histories and reproductive capacities of two freshwater amphipods: Gammarus fossarum and G. roeseli. The functions describe brood development times, hatching success, times taken to reach sexual maturity, growth, and fecundity. The sex ratio was assumed to be 0.5 and an autumn - winter reproductive resting period was based on observations of six river populations. Simulations included summer-cold mountain streams, summer-warm lowland rivers, watercourses fed by groundwater or influenced by heated effluents, and varying amplitudes of change within each year. 2. A FORTRAN 77 computer program calculated growth from birth to sexual maturity of first-generation females born on the first day of each calendar month in 1991, and the numbers of offspring successfully released from the maternal broodpouch in successive broods. At the 1991 - 93 regimes of temperature, individual G. fossarum released 127 - 208 offspring and G. roeseli released 120 - 169 in seven or eight successive broods during life spans of less than 2 years in six rivers. Life spans extended into a third year in the relatively cool River Salzach (mean temperature 7.5 degreesC). They were not completed in the very cold River Steyr (mean 5.6, range 2.5 - 7.9 degreesC), where G. fossarum produced five broods ( totalling 120 offspring) and G. roeseli only two broods ( totalling 28 offspring) in the 3-year period. Except in the Steyr, some offspring grew rapidly to maturity and produced several second-generation broods during the simulation period; in the warmest rivers some third-generation broods were also produced. Birth dates, early or late in the year, influenced the subsequent production of broods and young, depending on temperature regimes in particular rivers. Total numbers of offspring produced by the second and third generations represent the theoretical reproductive capacities of G. fossarum and G. roeseli. Minimum and maximum estimates mostly ranged from 100 to 17 300, were larger for G. fossarum except in the warmest river ( March), where temperatures rose above 20 degreesC for 56-78 days in summer, and largest ( maximum 37 600) in the River Voeckla heated by discharge from a power-station (mean 11.5 degreesC). Results from the simulations agree with preliminary assessments of relative abundances for G. fossarum and G. roeseli in several of the study rivers, but in some one or both species appear to be absent. On a wider scale, the present study confirms that G. fossarum is potentially more successful than G. roeseli in cool rivers but indicates that neither species is likely to maintain viable populations in cold rivers strongly influenced by snow and ice-melt. 3. The potential impacts of future river warming by increases of 1, 2 and 3 degreesC, due to climate change, vary according to river site, date of fertilisation, the extent of temperature increase, and the species of Gammarus. For Austrian rivers with mean temperatures in the range c. 7 - 10 degreesC, future warming would result in modest changes in the life histories and reproductive capacities of both G. fossarum and G. roeseli; the former would find improved temperature conditions in watercourses that are currently very cold throughout the year, and both would find warm rivers less tolerable. 4. The high potential reproductive capacity of gammarids, with rapid production of numerous successive broods when sexual maturity is finally achieved, indicates adaptation to high mortality during the relatively long period of growth to sexual maturity, and provides scope for an opportunistic strategy of emigration from centres of population abundance to colonise new territory when conditions are favourable. Rapid expansion of populations is desirable to combat the effects of environmental catastrophes, both frequent and short-term floods and droughts, and more long-term climatic changes that have occurred several times in glacial - interglacial periods during the current Ice Age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,JAN,2003,48,1,,,,,53,66,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00967.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00967.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000179693900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

To identify the biochemical changes affected by increasing temperature fluctuations and subsequent heat shock, we acclimated P. cinctipes for 30 days to one of three temperature regimes: (1) constant 10 degrees C, (2) daily temperature fluctuations between 10 and 20 degrees C ( 5 h up- ramp to 20 degrees C, 1 h down-ramp to 10 degrees C) and (3) 10-30 degrees C (up-ramp to 30 degrees C). After acclimation, animals were exposed to either 10 degrees C or a 30 degrees C heat shock to analyze the proteomic changes in claw muscle tissue. Following acclimation to 10- 30 degrees C (measured at 10 degrees C), enolase and ATP synthase increased in abundance. Following heat shock, isoforms of arginine kinase and glycolytic enzymes such as aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate dehydrogenase increased across all acclimation regimes. Full- length isoforms of hemocyanin increased abundance following acclimation to 10- 30 degrees C, but hemocyanin fragments increased after heat shock following constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10-20 degrees C, possibly playing a role as antimicrobial peptides. Following constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10- 20 degrees C, paramyosin and myosin heavy chain type-B increased in abundance, respectively, whereas myosin light and heavy chain decreased with heat shock. Actin- binding proteins, which stabilize actin filaments (filamin and tropomyosin), increased during heat shock following 10-30 degrees C; however, actin severing and depolymerization proteins (gelsolin and cofilin) increased during heat shock following 10-20 degrees C, possibly promoting muscle fiber restructuring. RAF kinase inhibitor protein and prostaglandin reductase increased during heat shock following constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10- 20 degrees C, possibly inhibiting an immune response during heat shock. The results suggest that ATP supply, muscle fiber restructuring and immune responses are all affected by temperature fluctuations and subsequent acute heat shock in muscle tissue. Furthermore, although heat shock after acclimation to constant 10 degrees C and fluctuating 10-30 degrees Cshowed the greatest effects on the proteome, moderately fluctuating temperatures (10-20 degrees C) broadened the temperature range over which claw muscle was able to respond to an acute heat shock with limited changes in the muscle proteome.",,,,,,"Stillman, Jonathon/0000-0002-4783-3830; Garland, Michael/0000-0002-9063-8547",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,FEB,2015,218,3,,,,,388,403,,10.1242/jeb.112250,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.112250,,,,,,,,25653421,,,,,WOS:000349404300016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Individual differences in work stress appraisal and psychobiological cost of prolonged load seem to be of importance in view of expanding compressed working time schedules. Twenty-one healthy, male volunteers (mean +/- SD:27.9 +/- 4.9 yrs) were required to stay in semiconstant routine conditions. They performed four sessions (each lasting similar to 2.5 h) of simulated driving, i.e., completed chosen tasks from computer driving games. Saliva samples were collected after each driving session, i.e., at 10:00-11:00, 14:00-15:00, 18:00-19:00, and 22:00-23:00 h as well as 10-30 min after waking (between 05:00 and 06:00 h) and at bedtime (after 00:00 h). Two subgroups of subjects were distinguished on the basis of the Chronotype Questionnaire: morning (M)- and evening (E)-oriented types. Subjective data on sleep need, sleeping time preferences, sleeping problems, and the details of the preceding night were investigated by questionnaire. Subjective measures of task load (NASA Task Load Index [NASA-TLX]), activation (Thayer's Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List [AD ACL]), and sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [KSS]) were applied at times of saliva samples collection. M-and E-oriented types differed significantly as to their ideal sleep length (6 h 54 min +/- 44 versus 8 h 13 min +/- 50 min), preferred sleep timing (midpoint at 03:19 versus 04:26), and sleep index, i.e., 'real-to-ideal' sleep ratio, before the experimental day (0.88 versus 0.67). Sleep deficit proved to be integrated with eveningness. M and E types exhibited similar diurnal profiles of energy, tiredness, tension, and calmness assessed by AD ACL, but E types estimated higher their workload (NASA-TLX) and sleepiness (KSS). M types exhibited a trend of higher mean cortisol levels than E types (F = 4.192, p < .056) and distinct diurnal variation (F = 2.950, p < .019), whereas E types showed a flattened diurnal curve. Cortisol values did not correlate with subjective assessments of workload, arousal, or sleepiness at any time-of-day. Diurnal cortisol pattern parameters (i.e., morning level, mean level, and range of diurnal changes) showed significant positive correlations with sleep length before the experiment (r = .48, .54, and .53, respectively) and with sleep index (r = .63, .64, and .56, respectively). The conclusions of this study are: (i) E-oriented types showed lower salivary cortisol levels and a flattened diurnal curve in comparison with M types; (ii) sleep loss was associated with lower morning cortisol and mean diurnal level, whereas higher cortisol levels were observed in rested individuals. In the context of stress theory, it may be hypothesized that rested subjects perceived the driving task as a challenge, whereas those with reduced sleep were not challenged, but bored/exhausted with the experimental situation.

Matthew",,,Thermal refuge affects space use and movement of a large-bodied galliform,JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Temperature affects every organism on Earth and has been argued to be one of the most critical factors influencing organisms' ecology and evolution. Most organisms are susceptible to landscape temperature ranges that exceed their thermal tolerance. As a result, the distribution of landscape features that mitigate thermal extremes can affect movement and space use of organisms. Using Rio Grande wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) as a model species, we measured black bulb temperature throughout the diurnal period and identified vegetation characteristics at wild turkey locations and random landscape locations. We observed that the thermal landscape was highly heterogeneous with temperature varying up to 52 degrees C at a given ambient temperature. Vegetation type strongly influenced temperature across space during daily peak heating, with taller vegetation types (woody vegetation > 2 m) having mean temperatures up to 8.95 degrees C cooler than the remainder of the landscape. However, these cooler vegetation types were uncommon, only accounting for 8.2% of the landscape. Despite the rarity of tall woody cover, wild turkey showed strong selection for this vegetation type particularly during peak daily heating with 74.9% of locations within 18 m of tree cover. Not only did wild turkey alter space use across time relative to temperature variation, but they also altered movement.

Since soil temperature measurements are seldom available for regional applications, they have to be estimated from standard meteorological data. The objective of this paper is to present a general, simple empirical approach for estimating daily depth profiles of soil temperature from air temperature and a surface cover index (LAI; leaf area index) mainly focusing on agricultural soils in cold temperate regions. Air and soil temperature data measured daily or every fifth day at one to six different depths were acquired from all meteorological stations in Sweden where such records are available. The stations cover latitudes from 55.65 degrees to 68.42 degrees N and mean annual air temperatures from +8.6 to -0.6 degrees C. The time series spanned between two and ten years. The soils at the stations cover a wide range of soil textures, including two organic soils. We calibrated the model first for each station and then for all stations together and the general parameterization only slightly decreased the goodness of fit. This general model then was applied to two treatments in a field experiment: bare soil and a winter rape crop. The parameters governing the influence of LAI on heat fluxes were optimized using this experiment. Finally, the model was validated using soil temperature data from two barley treatments differing in LAI taken from another field experiment. In general, the model predicted daily soil temperature profiles well. For all soils and depths at the meteorological stations, 95% of the simulated daily soil temperatures differed by less than 2.8 degrees C from measurements. The corresponding differences were somewhat higher for the validation data set (3.9 degrees C), but bias was still low. The model explained 95% of the variation in the validation data. Since no site-specific adjustments were made in the validation simulations, we conclude that the application of the general model presented here will result in good estimates of soil temperatures under cold temperate conditions. The very limited input requirements (only air temperature and LAI) that are easily obtainable from weather stations and from satellites make this model suitable for spatial applications at catchment or regional scales.",,,,,"Kätterer, Thomas/L-2107-2013","Kätterer, Thomas/0000-0002-1751-007X; Andren, Olof/0000-0002-9817-6308",,,,,,,,,,,,,0906-4710,,,,,,2009,59,1,,,,,77,86,,10.1080/09064710801920321,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09064710801920321,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000261735900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this, several analytical and numerical methodologies have been proposed to analyse the temperature variation of the soil in the short and long term. In this paper, a comparative study of different models (sinusoidal, semi-infinite and finite difference method) is conducted to estimate the shallow soil temperature variation in the short and long term. The models were compared with hourly experimental measured data of soil temperature in Leicester, UK, at depths between 0.75 and 2.75 m. The results show that the sinusoidal model is not appropriate to evaluate the short-term temperature variations, such as hourly or daily fluctuations. Likewise, this model is highly affected by the undisturbed ground temperature and can lead to very high errors. Regarding the semi-infinite model, it is accurate enough to predict the short-term temperature variation. However, it is useless to predict the long-term variation at depths greater than 1 m. The finite difference method (FDM) considering the air temperature as a boundary condition for the soil surface is the most accurate approach for estimating both short and long-term temperature variations while the FDM with heat flux as boundary condition is the least accurate approach due to the uncertainty of the assumed parameters. The ranges of errors for the sinusoidal, semi-infinite and FDM are found to be from 76.09 to 142.13%, 12.11 to 104.88% and 1.82 to 28.14% respectively.",,,,,"Naranjo-Mendoza, Carlos/J-7640-2019; Oyinlola, Muyiwa/AAT-1332-2021","Naranjo-Mendoza, Carlos/0000-0002-9356-5662; Oyinlola, Muyiwa/0000-0002-5760-672X; Greenough, Richard/0000-0002-1626-4321; Wright, Andrew/0000-0002-0777-619X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0375-6505,1879-3576,,,,NOV,2018,76,,,,,,38,49,,10.1016/j.geothermics.2018.06.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geothermics.2018.06.003,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000445308900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this knowledge gap, we subjected a coastal phytoplankton species, Heterosigma akashiwo, to ecologically relevant temperature shifts of 2-3 degrees C, cumulatively totaling 3-16 degrees C across a range from 6 degrees C to 31 degrees C over a 3-week period. Using a symmetric design, we show time dependent differences between growth rates and that these changes were related to the magnitude of the temperature shift, but not the direction. Cell size scaled inversely with temperature at a rate of -1.9 to -3.3%degrees C-1 at all except the highest temperature treatments > 25 degrees C. Intraspecific variability in growth rates increased exponentially with cumulative thermal shifts, suggesting thermal variability may be a driver of intraspecific variation. The observed acclimation effects on phytoplankton growth rates suggest that ignoring acclimation effects could systematically under or overestimate temperature-dependent primary production. Empirical results, contextualized with in situ coastal ocean temperature record, demonstrated that daily primary production could differ from current model assumptions utilizing acclimated rates by -33% to +36%. If broadly applicable to diverse phytoplankton species, these results have ramifications for predicting the ecology and production of phytoplankton in present day dynamic ecosystems and in future climate scenarios where thermal variability is expected to increase.",,,,,,"Strock, Jacob/0000-0002-5459-3468",,,,,,,,,,,,,0024-3590,1939-5590,,,,MAR,2021,66,3,,,,,740,752,,10.1002/lno.11637,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11637,,OCT 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000583531800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

All other things equal, predator capture rates are expected to depend on encounter rate with prey, prey escape capability (including prey defences), and on predator agility. Ectotherm predators and their prey both respond to increasing temperature by increased activity, i.e. predators increase their search area and prey may enhance their escape capability. This means that, as temperature changes, the ability of a predator to catch prey will decrease, increase, or remain unchanged depending on the relative effect of temperature on predator and prey. Their responses may further be differentially moulded by light conditions depending on whether the predator is diurnally or nocturnally active. It was hypothesised that flying Diptera are vulnerable to carabid beetles only at low temperatures and over the full temperature range for spiders because carabids, in contrast to spiders, are not built to catch swiftly moving prey. 2. The first experiment examined the spontaneous locomotor activity of the predators and of fruit flies at different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) and light conditions (light, dark). A second experiment examined the effect of temperature and light on the predation rate of two carabid beetles (Pterostichus versicolor and Calathus fuscipes) and two spiders (Clubiona phragmitis and Pardosa prativaga) using fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) as prey. 3. All four predators and the fruit fly increased their locomotory activity at higher temperatures. Activity of the carabid beetles peaked at intermediate temperatures; spiders and fruit flies were most active at the highest temperatures. Predation rate of the spiders increased with temperature whereas the beetles caught flies only at low temperatures (5 and 10 degrees C). 4. Diurnal variation in temperature may bring different prey groups within the set of potential prey at different times of the day or at different seasons.

The model is initialized with the stratification and shear of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) and is driven with heating and wind stress. A surface mixed layer is determined by bulk stability requirements, and a transition layer below the mixed layer is simulated by requiring that the gradient Richardson number be no less than 1/4. A principal result is that the nighttime phase of the diurnal cycle is strongly affected by the EUC, resulting in deep mixing and large dissipation at night consistent with observations of the equatorial upper ocean during the 1984 Tropic Heat experiment. The daytime (heating) phase of the simulated diurnal cycle is very similar to that seen at mid-latitudes. Solar heating produces a stably stratified surface layer roughly 10 m thick within which there is little, O(3 x 10(-8) W kg-1), turbulent dissipation. For the typical range of conditions at the equator, diurnal warming of the sea surface is 0.2-degrees-0.5-degrees-C, and the diurnal variation of surface current (diurnal jet) is 0.1-0.2 m s-1, consistent with observations. The nighttime (cooling) phase of the simulated diurnal cycle is quite different from that seen at mid-latitudes. As cooling removes the warm, stable surface layer, the wind stress can work directly against the shear of the EUC. This produces a transition layer that can reach to 80 m depth, or nearly to the core of the EUC. Within this layer the turbulent dissipation is quite large, O(2 x 10(-7) W kg-1). Thus the simulated dissipation has a diurnal range of more than a factor of 5, as observed in Tropic Heat, though the diurnal cycle of stratification and current are fairly modest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,APR 15,1992,97,C4,,,,,5409,5422,,10.1029/91JC01918,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91JC01918,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992HQ25600019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The technique can take advantage of the wider range of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) daily-averaged GCM datasets than is available using 3-hourly datasets. The daily-averaged host GCM atmospheric data are fitted to a time interpolation formula and then differentiated in time to produce a first-order estimate of the atmosphere at 0000 UTC on each simulation day. The processed GCM data are forced into CCAM using a scale-selective filter with an 18 degrees radius. Since this procedure is unable to account for the diurnal cycle, the forcing data are only applied to winds and air temperatures once per day between 800 and 100 hPa. Lateral boundary conditions are not required since CCAM employs a variable-resolution global grid. The technique is evaluated by downscaling daily-averaged 2.5 degrees NCEP reanalyses over Australia at 60-km resolution from 1971 to 2000 and comparing the results to downscaling the 6-hourly reanalyses and to simulating with sea surface temperature (SST)-only forcing. The results show that the daily-averaged downscaling technique can simulate average seasonal maximum and minimum screen temperatures and rainfall similar to those obtained downscaling 6-hourly reanalyses. Some implications for regional climate projections are considered by downscaling four daily-averaged GCM datasets from the twentieth-century climate in coupled models (20C3M) experiment over Australia.",,,,,"McGregor, John L/C-6646-2012; Thatcher, Marcus J/G-4010-2011","Thatcher, Marcus J/0000-0003-4139-5515; McGregor, John/0000-0003-2529-9849",,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-0644,,,,,JAN,2011,139,1,,,,,79,95,,10.1175/2010MWR3351.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2010MWR3351.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000287652100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Woodlice (the terrestrial isopod Porcellio laevis) exhibit a readily observed behaviour that may reflect their acclimation capacities. When they find themselves on their back, they sometimes roll over (i.e. right themselves). Whether they do, and how fast they do it, are measures of their behaviour and performance that vary with ambient temperature. Goal: Measure experimentally the effect of acclimation to environmental thermal variability on the rollover behaviour of Porcellio laevis. Methods: Maintain woodlice in 24 degrees C laboratory environments. Each individual lived in one of three thermal treatments: constant temperature regime (delta = 0); a regime with alternating temperatures of 27 degrees C during daytime and 21 degrees C at night (delta = 3); and a regime with alternating temperatures of 32 degrees C during daytime and 16 degrees C at night (delta = 8). After 3 months, measure the rollover behaviour (percentage that rolled over) and rollover speed of the woodlice at 5, 15, 25, 32, and 38 degrees C. Rollover speed is the inverse of the time it took an individual to right itself. Results: At 5 and 38 degrees C, most woodlice seemed to be in thermal coma and had very slow rollover speed. At 15, 25, and 32 degrees C, rollover speed was in the range 0.12-0.18 rollovers per second. At 15, 25, and 32 degrees C, 52% of individuals righted themselves in similar to 4 s. At these temperatures, most individuals either rolled quickly or remained inactive for the entire 10-min test period. When we examined rollover speed in the cooler (night) and warmer (daytime) periods, individuals subjected to the three regimes of temperature variation differed: woodlice acclimated to delta = 8 roll over very fast when temperature (T) is low and very slowly when T is high; woodlice acclimated to delta = 3 roll over fairly fast when T is low and somewhat slowly when T is high; and woodlice acclimated to delta = 0 roll over quite quickly when T is low and quite slowly when T is high. However, the higher and lower speeds at different regimes neutralized each other so that average rollover speed over the course of a whole day did not depend on the size of the daily fluctuation. Conclusions: The impact of temperature variability must be taken into consideration. Behavioural responses that are seemingly costly in the very short term may be beneficial in the longer term.",,,,,"Rezende, Enrico L./S-3219-2019; Rezende, Enrico L/B-8029-2012","Rezende, Enrico L./0000-0002-6245-9605; Rezende, Enrico L/0000-0002-6245-9605",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-0613,1937-3791,,,,,2016,17,1,,,,,111,124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000384803400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

By considering gravity wave phase speeds, we find that the circulation adjustment into weak temperature gradient (WTG) balance occurs rapidly (<6 h) relative to diurnal diabatic forcing on the spatial scales typical of organized convection (<= 500 km). Convection-permitting numerical simulations of selfaggregation in diurnal radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) are conducted to explore this further. These simulations depict a pronounced diurnal cycle of circulation linked to organized convection, which indeed maintains WTG balance to first order. A set of sensitivity experiments is conducted to assess what governs the diurnal cycle of organized convection. We find that the direct radiation-convection interaction'' (or lapserate) mechanism is of primary importance for diurnal precipitation range, while the dynamic cloudy-clear differential radiation'' mechanism amplifies the range by approximately 30%, and delays the nocturnal precipitation peak by around 5 h. The differential radiation mechanism therefore explains the tendency for tropical heavy rainfall to peak in the early morning, while the lapse-rate mechanism primarily governs diurnal amplitude. The diurnal evolution of circulation can be understood as follows. While nocturnal deep convection invigorated by cloud-top cooling (i.e., the lapse-rate mechanism) leads to strong bottom-heavy circulation at nighttime, the localized (i.e., differential) top-heavy shortwave warming in the convective region invigorates circulation at upper levels in daytime. A diurnal evolution of the circulation therefore arises, from bottom heavy at nighttime to top heavy in daytime, in a qualitatively consistent manner with the observed diurnal pulsing of the Hadley cell driven by the ITCZ.",,,,,"Ruppert, James H./AAD-1003-2020","Ruppert, James H./0000-0001-5235-9718",,,,,,,,,,,,,0894-8755,1520-0442,,,,JUN,2018,31,12,,,,,4899,4916,,10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0693.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0693.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000450689300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experiments from the 1D model forced with fluxes at a range of temporal resolutions and with differing vertical resolution of the model have shown that to capture 90% of the diurnal variability of SST, and hence 95% of the intraseasonal variability of SST, requires a 3-h or better temporal resolution of the fluxes and a vertical grid with an upper-layer thickness of the order of 1 m. In addition to the impact of the representation of the diurnal cycle on the intraseasonal variability of SST, the strength of the mixing across the thermocline was found to be enhanced by the proper representation of the nighttime deep mixing in the ocean, implying a possible impact of the diurnal cycle onto the mean climate of the tropical ocean.",,,,,"Guilyardi, Eric/D-4868-2011","Guilyardi, Eric/0000-0002-2255-8625; Bernie, Dan/0000-0003-3522-8921; Woolnough, Steven/0000-0003-0500-8514",,,,,,,,,,,,,0894-8755,,,,,APR 15,2005,18,8,,,,,1190,1202,,10.1175/JCLI3319.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI3319.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000228975100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The target is to examine the diurnal cycle over land in today's numerical weather prediction and climate models for operational and research purposes. The set-up of the case is based on observations taken during the Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study-1999 (CASES-99), which was held in Kansas, USA in the early autumn with a strong diurnal cycle with no clouds present. The models are forced with a constant geostrophic wind, prescribed surface temperature and large-scale divergence. Results from 30 different model simulations and one large-eddy simulation (LES) are analyzed and compared with observations. Even though the surface temperature is prescribed, the models give variable near-surface air temperatures. This, in turn, gives rise to differences in low-level stability affecting the turbulence and the turbulent heat fluxes. The increase in modelled upward sensible heat flux during the morning transition is typically too weak and the growth of the convective boundary layer before noon is too slow. This is related to weak modelled near-surface winds during the morning hours. The agreement between the models, the LES and observations is the best during the late afternoon. From this intercomparison study, we find that modelling the diurnal cycle is still a big challenge. For the convective part of the diurnal cycle, some of the first-order schemes perform somewhat better while the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) schemes tend to be slightly better during nighttime conditions. Finer vertical resolution tends to improve results to some extent, but is certainly not the solution to all the deficiencies identified.",,,,,"Steeneveld, Gert-Jan/B-2816-2010; Triviño, Laura Conangla/H-1998-2015; Mauritsen, Thorsten/G-5880-2013; Holtslag, Bert/HCH-1861-2022; Angevine, Wayne M/H-9849-2013; Cuxart, Joan/F-8921-2019; Cuxart, Joan/AAE-7697-2019; Holtslag, Albert A.M./B-7842-2010; Pleim, Jonathan Pleim/C-1331-2017","Steeneveld, Gert-Jan/0000-0002-5922-8179; Triviño, Laura Conangla/0000-0002-8467-6299; Mauritsen, Thorsten/0000-0003-1418-4077; Angevine, Wayne M/0000-0002-8021-7116; Cuxart, Joan/0000-0002-6217-8045; Cuxart, Joan/0000-0002-6217-8045; Holtslag, Albert A.M./0000-0003-0995-2481; Pleim, Jonathan Pleim/0000-0001-6190-6082; ZAMPIERI, Matteo/0000-0002-7558-1108; de Bruijn, Cisco/0000-0002-2718-6779",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8314,1573-1472,,,,AUG,2011,140,2,,,,,177,206,,10.1007/s10546-011-9611-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-011-9611-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000292556600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Surface temperature was measured with nadir-viewing radiothermometers near 1400 h (LST). The average residual standard error in the estimate of H(d) was 0.6 mm of equivalent evaporation. An equation for the daily sensible heat flux (H(d)) having a form analogous to Dalton's evaporation formula was derived from surface energy budget considerations. This equation discriminates well between relatively homogeneous, low-cover surfaces where surface exchange characteristics can be assumed to be simple fractions of the height of the roughness elements. By contrast, data from two other crops with discontinuous plant cover suggest a much reduced sensitivity to canopy architecture. This result is not unreasonable if scalar transport were controlled by the thermal conductivity of a layer of still air close to ground level which is sheltered by the plant canopy.

These data have been analysed to examine the diurnal variability of upper oceanic heat budget and to estimate the eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat in the upper layer. Diurnal variation of near-surface temperature is typical at northern location (13 degrees N) with a range of 0.5 degrees C while the diurnal range of temperature is enhanced to 0.8 degrees C at the central location (10 degrees N) due to intense solar radiation (1050W/m(2)), clear skies and low wind speeds. At the southern location (7 degrees N), the diurnal variation of temperature is atypical with the minimum temperature occurring at 2000 hrs instead of at early morning hours. In general, the diurnal curve of temperature penetrated up to 15 to 20 m with decreasing diurnal range with depth. The VM-ADCP measured horizontal currents in the upper ocean were predominantly easterly/northeasterly at southern location, north/northerly at central location and northwesterly at northern location, thus describing a large-scale cyclonic gyre with the northward meridional flow along 87 degrees E. The magnitudes of heat loss at the surface due to air-sea heat exchanges and in the upper 50 m layer due to vertical diffusion of heat are highest at the southern location where intense convective activity followed by overcast skies and synoptic disturbance prevailed in the lower atmosphere. This and the estimated higher value (0.0235 m(2)/s) of eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat in the upper ocean (0-50 m depth) suggest that 1-D processes controlled the upper layer heat budget at the southern location. On the other hand, during the fair weather conditions, at the central and northern locations, the upper layer gained heat energy, while the sea surface lost (gained) heat energy at northern (central) location. This and lower values of eddy diffusivity coefficient of heat (0.0045 and 0.0150 m(2)/s) and the northward intensification of horizontal currents at these locations suggest the greater role of horizontal heat advection over the 1-D processes in the upper ocean heat budget at these two locations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0253-4126,,,,,JUN,2000,109,2,,,,,267,277,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000089267000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Latent heat storage can operate only at single phase change temperature. This problem can be avoided by some of the thermochemical storage systems in which solar energy can be stored and released over a range of high temperature by endothermic and exothermic reactions. One such reaction system is reversible reaction involving dehydration of Ca(OH)(2) and hydration of CaO. This system is considered in the present study to model a circular fixed bed reactor for storage and release of heat at high temperatures.

Thirty, clinically healthy free-ranging donkeys, divided into 3 groups of 10 donkeys each according to their age, served as experimental subjects. Behavioral activities of donkeys were monitored bihourly from 06:00 to 06:00 h (GMT +1) during the cold-dry and hot-dry seasons. Application of single cosinor procedure showed that behavioral activities exhibited varying levels of daily rhythmicity in both seasons. Behavioral activities of adult, yearling, and foal donkeys peaked during the afternoon period (13:11-14:45 h) of the photophase of the light-dark cycle during the cold-dry and hot-dry seasons. The diurnal index of activity rhythm showed that donkeys are mostly diurnal animals. During the study period, the percentage time spent on feeding during the harmattan season was higher (P < 0.05) than during the hot-dry season in adults (37.38 +/- 1.57% vs 30.72 +/- 1.29%), yearlings (33.20 +/- 1.43% vs 27.00 +/- 125%), and foals (16.79 +/- 0.82% vs 14.38 +/- 0.65%). The percentage time spent dozing during the hot-dry season by adults (28.21 +/- 1.59%), yearlings (29.31 +/- 1.60%), and foals (37.64 +/- 1.48%) was higher (P < 0.05), when compared with the corresponding values (23.75 +/- 1.55%, 26.43 +/- 1.59% and 42.42 +/- 1.40%, respectively) obtained during the harmattan season. In conclusion, daily rhythmicity of behavioral activities in donkeys, kept under natural light-dark cycle, was similar in both seasons, although the intensity of activity was higher in the cold-dry than the hot-dry season. This finding may be useful in the management, improvement of productivity, and welfare of working donkeys under different thermal environmental conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

To mimic more naturalistic conditions, this experiment examined how variation in temperature fluctuations affects offspring sex as well as a suite of phenotypic parameters having putative fitness consequences in the Northern Painted Turtle (Chrysemys picta (Schneider, 1783)). We also characterized variation in natural nest temperatures, including the daily temperature range, related to the vegetation cover surrounding the nest. We found that temperature fluctuations did not affect hatchling morphology, immune response, or behavior, but did significantly affect offspring sex ratios. Thermal profiles of natural nests were related to the amount of surrounding vegetation.

An unresolved question is what role individual factors such as growth play in regulating elemental incorporation. Disentangling growth variation from thermal effects is particularly challenging in fishes yet integral to understanding the mechanisms of incorporation and interpreting patterns of variation in the field. Juvenile Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) were maintained in a controlled laboratory setting to evaluate the relative importance of growth rate, ration, and temperature on otolith elemental incorporation. Fish were held at four temperatures (2, 5, 9, 13 degrees C) and fed daily to apparent satiation. An additional treatment included fish that were held at 9'C and fed a reduced ration (1% body mass d(-1)). Fish were maintained for variable duration (40-147 d), depending on ration and temperature, to ensure adequate otolith growth for analysis. Water samples for chemical analysis were collected to determine elemental partition coefficients (D-Me). Overall, mean growth rates ranged from -0.09 to 1.52% d(-1). For the 9 degrees C fish, there was a clear ration effect on D-Mn (2.6X higher at high ration) and D-Sr (1.5X higher at low ration), a small effect for D-Mg (1.1X higher at high ration), and no effect for D-Ba. For high ration fish, there was a positive effect of temperature on D-Mn and D-Mg, due solely to differences associated with the 2 degrees C treatment, and no effect on D(Sr )and D-Ba. Correlations between growth and D Me within temperature treatments were variable, but for D-Mn and D-Sr the directionality mirrored the ration effect with positive correlations for D-Mn and negative correlations for D-Sr. Overall, the observed ration effects were greater than any growth rate effect, indicating that the effect of ration is due to more than growth variation.",,,,,,"Miller, Jessica/0000-0002-6491-4085",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,MAY 26,2020,7,,,,,,,,320,10.3389/fmars.2020.00320,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.00320,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000535529800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present paper, records over the period 1987-2004 from a long-term agroecosystem experiment carried out in Northeast China were used to explore the impacts of global warming on soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) yields under different controlled fertilization treatments. The results indicated that soybean yields were closely related to growing season temperatures. In most fertilization treatments, soybean yields showed a significant negative response to higher daily maximum temperature and greater diurnal temperature range (DTR), whereas they showed a significant positive response to higher daily minimum temperature. Analysis of covariance showed that these responses of soybean yields to temperature variables did not differ across fertilization treatments. Overall, soybean yields have declined significantly due to the warming trends since 1987. This has been mainly attributed to the higher daily maximum temperature. The present report demonstrates that soybean production in Northeast China may face challenges due to global warming unless potential adaptation options are adopted.

From these results, we conclude that unusually high-water temperatures combined with high DWTRs and low water levels drove riverine ayu mortality from E. ictaluri infection.",,,,,,"Takeuchi, Hisato/0000-0003-4658-9570",,,,,,,,,,,,,0140-7775,1365-2761,,,,AUG,2021,44,8,,,,,1065,1074,,10.1111/jfd.13368,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.13368,,MAR 2021,,,,,,33755230,,,,,WOS:000631376200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since temperature is one of a number of influential environmental factors for germination and establishment of grass species, experiments were conducted to determine the effect of temperature on seed germination of tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh. = Festuca arundinacea Schreb. var. arundinacea Schreb.) (cv. 'Vegas', cv. 'Barlexas I', and cv. 'Barlexas II'). Seeds were placed on moistened filter paper and subjected to 36 regimes of constant and altering temperatures from 5 to 40 degrees C. Germination data from the 36 temperature profiles were used to construct quadratic response surfaces for estimated percent germination with confidence intervals for each cultivar tested. Seeds germinated over a wide range of temperature. Optimal germination, defined as not less than the maximum observed minus one-half of the confidence interval at the 0.05 level of probability, occurred at constant temperatures of 20 and 25 degrees C and the 20/25 degrees C regime (16/8 h). Fluctuating temperature did not increase seed germination. Highest germination for all three cultivars occurred along the constant temperature gradient diagonal. Response surface predictions were used to develop species-based rules. These rules, in conjunction with national grids of temperature data, were modeled and mapped to predict and illustrate optimum sowing times for tall fescue in China. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Given that hop is a long-lived perennial and that brewers still demand Cascade, there is a need to better understand factors that influence the development of powdery mildew on this cultivar. Growth chamber experiments were conducted to quantify the effect of constant, transient, and fluctuating temperature on Cascade before, concurrent to, and after inoculation as contrasted with another powdery mildew-susceptible cultivar, 'Symphony'. Exposure of plants to supraoptimal temperature (26 and 32 degrees C) before inoculation led to more rapid onset of ontogenic resistance in intermediately aged leaves in Cascade as compared with Symphony. Cascade was overall less susceptible to powdery mildew when exposed to constant temperature ranging from 18 to 32 degrees C directly after inoculation. However, cultivar also interacted with temperature such that proportionately fewer and smaller colonies developed on Cascade than Symphony at supraoptimal yet permissive temperatures for disease. When plants were inoculated and then exposed to high temperature, colonies became progressively more tolerant to temperatures of 26 to 30 degrees C with increasing time from inoculation to exposure, as moderated by cultivar, the specific temperature, and their interaction. Subjecting plants to simulated diurnal temperature regimes at the time of inoculation or 24 h later indicated Cascade and Symphony responded proportionately similarly on days predicted to be marginally unfavorable or marginally favorable for powdery mildew, although Cascade was quantitatively less susceptible than Symphony. In sum, this research indicates that Cascade is overall less susceptible to powdery mildew than Symphony, and supraoptimal temperature before, concurrent to, or after infection may interact differentially to moderate disease risk in Cascade. Therefore, cultivar-specific risk assessments for powdery mildew appear warranted.",,,,,,"Gent, David/0000-0001-9529-9831",,,,,,,,,,,,,0191-2917,1943-7692,,,,JUN 1,2022,106,6,,,,,1681,1689,,10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2133-RE,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-21-2133-RE,,MAY 2022,,,,,,34978868,,,,,WOS:000791672900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Germination of dry-stored achenes was tested at increasing amplitudes of temperature fluctuations, and stratified achenes were germinated at constant temperatures. Dormancy release was examined in the laboratory at constant temperatures of 3, 8, 12, 15 and 18 degrees C. The effect of an increase in temperature during stratification from 5 degrees C to 15, 18 or 20/10 degrees C on dormancy was tested. Moreover, achenes were exposed to yearly seasonal temperature cycles in the soil in an experimental garden. Germination of dry-stored achenes was not promoted by fluctuating temperatures, while stratified achenes germinated (> 5%) over a range of constant temperatures between 9 and 36 degrees C. Dormancy was relieved at all stratification temperatures, but temperatures l12 degrees C were more effective than higher temperatures, since germination occurred over a wider range of test conditions after these pretreatments. An induction of secondary dormancy occurred only if the temperature was increased during stratification. Annual dormancy cycles were apparent when achenes were germinated at 15 degrees C, while at 25 and 15/5 degrees C germination was always > 60%. The germination behaviour of Eupatorium is that of a typical wetland species. Thus, non-dormant achenes germinated at relatively high temperatures, and germination was promoted by fluctuating temperatures. The annual course of dormancy revealed that achenes can germinate throughout the growing season under favourable conditions. Achenes sown in an experimental garden germinated in spring, when daily mean temperatures were around 14 degrees C. A decline in viability of achenes after 19 months' burial indicated that Eupatorium does not form a long-term persistent seed bank.",,,,,"Jensen, Kai/L-6657-2015","Jensen, Kai/0000-0002-0543-070X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-2585,,,,,JUN,2005,15,2,,,,,143,151,,10.1079/SSR2005202,http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/SSR2005202,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000230082800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, most previous studies on the effects of climate change utilized a model of uniform annual change, which assumes that temperature increases are symmetric on diurnal or seasonal time scales. In this study, we simulated observed trends in the asymmetric alteration of diurnal temperature range by increasing night-time temperatures experienced by female lizards during their ovarian cycle as well as by the resulting eggs during their incubation. We found that higher night-time temperatures during the ovarian cycle increased the probability of reproductive success and decreased the duration of the reproductive cycle, but did not affect embryo stage or size at oviposition, clutch size, egg mass or relative clutch mass. Furthermore, higher incubation temperatures increased hatchling size and decreased incubation period but had no effect on incubation success. Subsequent hatchlings were more likely to survive winter if they hatched earlier, though our sample size of hatchlings was relatively small. These findings indicate that higher night-time temperatures mainly affect rate processes and that certain aspects of life history are less directly temperature dependent. As our findings confirm that climate warming is likely to increase the rate of development as well as advance reproductive phenology, we predict that warmer nights during the breeding season will increase reproductive output as well as subsequent survival in many temperate ectotherms, both of which should have positive fitness effects.",,,,,"Clarke, D.

By assuming that the spectral emissivities are constant over a short time period (12-24 h), two sets of split-window radiance measurements taken at two different times are used to retrieve two spectral emissivities and two land surface temperatures (LSTs) simultaneously. The algorithm employs an optimization scheme rather than a direct solver for a system of equations because of constraint requirements. The retrieved variables minimize the rms differences between measured satellite radiances and those predicted by a spectrally detailed radiative transfer model. A GOES-8 version of the algorithm is validated with in situ radiometer measurements from the Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Cloud and Radiation Testbed (ARM CART) site. In addition, an AVHRR version is validated with in situ measurements from the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) site, the Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot Experiment-Sahel (HAPEX-Sahel) site: and an LST validation sits operated near Melbourne, Australia. The biases of the retrieved LSTs for the validation sites in the Australian, FIFE, and ARM CART study areas are approximately 0.08 degrees, 1.7 degrees, and 1.4 degrees C, respectively, yielding an overall bias error of better than half the current expected accuracy limit of some +/-3 degrees C. The associated bias-adjusted rmse differences are approximately 0.78 degrees, 4.8 degrees, and 4.5 degrees C, respectively, mostly driven by intercomparing in situ point measurements to area-integrated satellite pixel retrievals. The bias-adjusted rmse differences for HAPEX-Sahel are larger (5 degrees and 11 degrees C), resulting from incomplete characterization of site heterogeneity, insufficient radiosonde launch frequency, and poor data quality of the temperature-moisture soundings, rather than intrinsic algorithm problems. Notably, the averaged retrieved emissivities for the trouble-free sites are within the expected range of emissivities for vegetated surfaces. The GOES-8 retrieved LSTs exhibit small amplitude, high-frequency noise, and a daily error cycle when compared to in situ measurements. The noise is attributed to random detector errors in the satellite observations for which the channel 4 noise-equivalent temperature difference is larger than that of channel 5. The systematic differences between validation measurements and retrievals are near zero during nighttime but exhibit a small semidiurnal oscillation during daytime. Notwithstanding a possible semidiurnal bias in the pyrgeometer validation measurements associated with imperfect solar dome hearing corrections, plus unaccounted-for attenuation between the surface and pyrgeometer, the latter error cycle is attributed to a too-coarse sampling of the nonlinear diurnal evolution of the thermodynamic structure of the atmospheric boundary layer, particularly near the sunrise and sunset transition times. Thus, sounding frequency determines the error characteristics of the nonlinearly evolving split-window weighting functions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0739-0572,1520-0426,,,,NOV,1999,16,11,2,,,,1673,1689,,10.1175/1520-0426(1999)016<1673:SLSTER>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0426(1999)016<1673:SLSTER>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000083859600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used the Community Earth System Model version 1 as the base model and performed a suite of 3 d hindcasts initialized every day starting at 00:00 Z from 1997 to 2012. Three processes - the diurnal cycle of clouds during different cloud regimes over the central US, precipitation and diabatic heating associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the response of precipitation, surface radiative and heat fluxes, as well as zonal wind stress to sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation - are evaluated as examples to demonstrate how one can better utilize simulations from this experiment to gain insights into model errors and their connection to physical parameterizations or large-scale state. This is achieved by comparing the hindcasts with corresponding long-term observations for periods based on different phenomena. These analyses can only be done through this multi-year hindcast approach to establish robust statistics of the processes under well-controlled large-scale environment because these phenomena are either a result of interannual climate variability or only happen a few times in a given year (e.g., MJO, or cloud regime types). Furthermore, comparison of hindcasts to the typical simulations in climate mode with the same model allows one to infer what portion of a model's climate error directly comes from fast errors in the parameterizations of moist processes. As demonstrated here, model biases in the mean state and variability associated with parameterized moist processes usually develop within a few days and manifest within weeks to affect the simulations of large-scale circulation and ultimately the climate mean state and variability.

When eggs were fertilized and constantly incubated at various temperatures, the effective level for 50% of the eggs and embryos (EL50) of temperature was 7.6 degrees C at the developmental stage when eye pigmentation was visible. Fewer developmental abnormalities and a lower cumulative mortality rate were observed when embryos were exposed to high temperatures from the later, gastrula stage, than from fertilization or the four-cell stage. Irrespective of retarded development in terms of day-degrees (i.e. the sum of daily mean temperatures), a high incubation temperature reduced the development time of C. lavaretus, leading to earlier hatching, and hatched fry were shorter than at the reference temperature of 4-5 degrees C.

There has even been a report of a shift from CAM to C-3 in response to overwatering a species of Agave. We investigated whether C-3 photosynthesis can contribute substantially to carbon uptake and growth in young and mature Agave angustifolia collected from its natural habitat in Panama. In well-watered plants, CO2 uptake in the dark contributed about 75% of daily carbon gain. This day/night pattern of CO2 exchange was highly conserved under a range of environmental conditions and was insensitive to intensive watering. Elevated CO2 (800 ppm) stimulated CO2 fixation predominantly in the light. Exposure to CO2-free air at night markedly enhanced CO2 uptake during the following light period, but CO2 exchange rapidly reverted to its standard pattern when CO2 was supplied during the subsequent 24 h.

LP(0) and LP(50) were expressed as days, in degree-hours (accumulated hourly temperatures above a threshold of 0 C), and in units of accumulated hourly developmental rates derived from a nonlinear function fit to values of LP(0) from a previous constant-temperature study. We found that the variability in LP(0) and LP(50) was greater when latent periods were measured in degree-hours (coefficient of variation [CV] between 6.2 and 30.9%) or developmental rates (6.4% less than or equal to CV less than or equal to 48.6%) than when they were measured in days (4.0% less than or equal to CV less than or equal to 17.5%). Thus, there seems to be little advantage in using degree-hours or developmental rates to model latent periods of lettuce downy mildew. Values of LP(0) were shorter at low and longer at high temperatures with fluctuating temperatures compared to constant temperatures with the same mean. Possible reasons for the difference between constant- and fluctuating-temperature data are discussed.",,,,,,"Scherm, Harald/0000-0002-3196-3163",,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-949X,1943-7684,,,,AUG,1994,84,8,,,,,853,859,,10.1094/Phyto-84-853,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-84-853,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994PC46900013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sequential measurements of body temperature, air temperature, relative humidity and THI were monitored every 5 min. Four cross-bred Holstein-Frisian (93.75% HF) cows were assigned randomly to be used in two trial periods to determine the effects of heat stress and improved cooling system on body temperature. The experiment was conducted in the barn for a total of 6 days, 3 days without a supplemental cooling system (control) and 3 days with a supplemental cooling system (treatment). All cows were housed in the same barn throughout the experiment, but the treatment animals were exposed to the improved cooling system with sprinklers and fans in the holding pen 7 times a day. In this study, air temperature was negatively correlated (r = -0.983, p < 0.0001) with relative humidity, but positively correlated with THI (r = 0.996, p < 0.001). In addition, THI and air temperature were positively correlated (r = 0.709, p < 0.0001 and r = 0.714, p < 0.0001, respectively) with body temperature of the control animals. The mean level of body temperature of the control animals was higher (p < 0.05) than the treatment animals. Body temperature of the control animals consistently rose during the day, reaching a peak in the afternoon (1400 h), after which it remained relatively stable until midnight and then fell throughout early morning. The daily rhythmicity of body temperature had a mean level of 39.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C with a maximum-minimum range of 0.9 degrees C in the control animals. In contrast, body temperatures of the treatment animals fell by 0.3-1.0 degrees C after the improved cooling occurred at 0500, 0900, 1100, 1400, 1600, 1900 and 2200 h. Thus, their body temperatures were maintained in the range of 37.9-39.4 degrees C. The mean level of body temperature of these animals was 38.5 +/- 0.3 degrees C. In conclusion, climatic conditions have a significant influence on body temperature. Body temperature of dairy cows under tropical conditions has a daily rhythmicity, with a period of rising body temperature and increasing heat load during the day (hyperthermia), followed by a period of heat dissipation and falling body temperature during the night. Improved intensive cooling with sprinklers and fans has the potential to decrease the severity of heat stress and maintain a normal body temperature of dairy cows under hot and humid climatic conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0125-6491,,,,,SEP,2013,43,3,,,,,367,373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000339784200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The temperature of the oxidation tank influences the oxidation efficiency between the ore pulp and bacteria, including the yield of gold. Therefore, measurement has consistently been an important subject for researchers. As an effective data processing method, data fusion has been used extensively in many fields of industrial production. However, the interference of equipment or external factors such as the diurnal temperature difference or powerful wind may constantly increase measurement errors and damage certain sensors, which may transmit error data. These problems can be solved by following a pretreatment process. First, we establish a heat transfer mechanism model. Second, we design a small-range sensor network for the pretreatment process and present a layered fusion structure of sharing sensors using a multi-connected fusion structure. Third, we introduce the idea of iterative operation in data processing. In addition, we use prior data for predicting state values twice in order to improve the effectiveness of extended Kalman filtering in one time step. This study also proposes multi-fading factors on the basis of a weighted fading memory index to adjust the prediction error covariance. Finally, the state estimation accuracy of each sensor can be used as a weighting principle for the predictive confidence of each sensor by adding a weighting factor. In this study, the performance of the proposed method is verified by simulation and compared with the traditional single-sensor method. Actual industrial measurement data are processed by the proposed method for the equipment experiment. The performance index of the simulation and the experiment shows that the proposed method has a higher global accuracy than the traditional single-sensor method. Simulation results show that the accuracy of the proposed method has a 55% improvement upon that of the traditional single-sensor method, on average. In the equipment experiment, the accuracy of the industrial measurement improved by 37% when using the proposed method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1424-8220,,,,JAN 1,2019,19,1,,,,,,,64,10.3390/s19010064,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s19010064,,,,,,,,30585178,,,,,WOS:000458574600064,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such variations result primarily from imbalances between surface freshwater fluxes and vertical mixing of deeper water to the surface. New observations becoming available from satellite salinity remote sensing missions could help to constrain estimates of diurnal variations in air-sea exchange of freshwater, and provide insight into the processes governing diurnal variability of mixing processes in the upper ocean. Additionally, a better understanding of variation in near surface salinity is required to compare satellite measured SSS with in situ measurements at a few meters depth. The diurnal SSS variations should be reflected as differences between ascending and descending pass retrievals from the Aquarius and SMOS satellites; however, the diurnal signal can be masked by inadequacies of the geophysical corrections used in processing the satellite measurements. In this study, we quantify the expected range of diurnal SSS variations using a model developed for predicting diurnal sea surface temperature variations. We present estimates for the mean and variance of the global diurnal SSS cycle, contrasting it with the diurnal cycle of sea surface temperature. We find the SSS diurnal cycle can be significant throughout the tropics, with mean amplitudes of up to 0.1 psu in areas with heavy precipitation. Predicted maximum diurnal ranges approach 2 psu in select regions. Surface freshening in Aquarius salinity retrievals is shown to be larger for ascending than descending passes, consistent with the expectations from the model simulation.",,,,,"Bryan, Frank O/I-1309-2016","Bryan, Frank O/0000-0003-1672-8330; Bailey, David/0000-0002-6584-0663",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9275,2169-9291,,,,MAY,2015,120,5,,,,,3211,3228,,10.1002/2014JC010483,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JC010483,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000356628100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Broadcast spawning corals are one of the best examples of an organism integrating inputs from multiple environmental parameters, including seasonal temperature, the lunar phase and hour of the day, to calibrate their annual reproductive event. We present a deep RNA-sequencing experiment utilizing multiple analyses to differentiate transcriptomic responses modulated by the interactions between the three aforementioned environmental parameters. Acropora millepora was sampled over multiple 24-hr periods throughout a full lunar month and at two seasonal temperatures. Temperature, lunar and diurnal cycles produce distinct transcriptomic responses, with interactions between all three variables identifying a core set of genes. These core genes include mef2, a developmental master regulator, and two heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, one of which is known to post-transcriptionally interact with mef2 and with biological clock-regulating mRNAs. Interactions between diurnal and temperature differences impacted a range of core processes ranging from biological clocks to stress responses. Genes involved with developmental processes and transcriptional regulation were impacted by the lunar phase and seasonal temperature differences. Lastly, there was a diurnal and lunar phase interaction in which genes involved with RNA-processing and translational regulation were differentially regulated.

The results show that both experiments as well as ERA5 can successfully capture the spatial distribution and the daily variation of T2m and precipitation, with reasonable cold bias for temperature and dry bias for precipitation when compared with the station observations. In addition, the diurnal cycle of precipitation is investigated, indicating that both experiments tend to simulate the afternoon precipitation peak in advance and postpone the night precipitation peak. The precipitation bias is reduced by using the spectral nudging technique, especially at night and early morning. Both WRF experiments outperform ERA5 in reproducing the diurnal cycle of precipitation amount. Possible causes for the differences between the two experiments are also analyzed. In the re-initialization experiment, the daytime net shortwave radiation contributes a lot to the cold biases of Tmax, and the stronger vertically integrated moisture flux convergence leads to more precipitation compared with the spectral nudging experiment over the central and southeastern TP.

The objective of this study is to present spatial and temporal variations of air temperatures and relative humidity on the north slope of Mt. Qomolangma. Both hourly air temperatures and relative humidity were measured at seven automatic weather stations (AWS) from 5207 to 7028 m a.s.l. from May 2007 through September 2008. Long-term (1959-2007) air temperature and precipitation data were obtained from Dingri Meteorological Station. The preliminary results show that the elevational gradient of mean annual air temperature is non-linear, which decreases from 0.2 degrees C at an elevation of 5207 m to -4.4 degrees C at 5792 m, and -5.4 degrees C at 5955 m. The maxima are 14.6, 9.1, and 18.6 degrees C, and the minima are -24.2, -28.8, and -29.3 degrees C at the three elevations, respectively. The relative humidity does not change significantly with increasing elevation except over glacier ice, but the mixing ratio decreases due to the decrease in air temperature. The mean diurnal ranges of air temperature and relative humidity decrease with increasing elevation. The daily maximum air temperature occurs significantly later at the high-elevation site than that at the low elevation site because the air temperature at the high-elevation site is affected to a large extent by downward mixing of warm air near the ablation zone of the glacier during daytime. The air moisture content reflects the pronounced alternation of the wet and dry seasons, and the highest water vapor content is associated with the southwesterly Indian monsoon. The mean annual surface air temperature-elevation gradient is 0.72 +/- 0.01 degrees C (100 m)(-1), and also shows a pronounced seasonal signature. Mean annual air temperatures have increased by about 0.62 degrees C per decade over the last 49 years in this region; the greatest warming trend is observed in winter, the smallest in summer. Warmer conditions have been observed since the mid-1980s. Additional studies have shown a reduction in precipitation in the 1960s that resulted in a decrease in net snow accumulation. Therefore, accelerated retreat of the Rongbuk Glacier since the 1980s may be caused by rising air temperature and the decreased precipitation.",,,,,"ZHANG, TINGJUN/AAX-3662-2020; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018","Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; ZHANG, Tingjun/0000-0001-6974-9501",,,,,,,,,,,,,1523-0430,1938-4246,,,,FEB,2011,43,1,,,,,147,160,,10.1657/1938-4246-43.1.147,http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-43.1.147,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000288633400015,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper describes a simulation study to quantify the effectiveness of PCMs at reducing thermal loads through building envelope components and to develop a design strategy for the placement of PCMs within building components. The PCM studied is the paraffin octadecane, with an average melt/freeze temperature of 25.6 degrees C (78.1 degrees F). Thermal loads through PCM concrete sandwich walls, frame walls, and steel roofs were simulated using an explicit finite-difference procedure with the indoor air temperature held constant and with two sets of outdoor boundary conditions: a single day in which the outdoor air temperature varied sinusoidally and a year of typical meteorological data from Dayton, Ohio. The simulation technique has been validated in previous experimental and simulation work. The results indicate that the addition of PCM to building components measurably decreases both peak and annual cooling loads, even through high-mass building components such as concrete walls. Moreover the load reduction ability of a building component with PCM is strongly related to the placement of the PCM within the building component. To understand this effect, diurnal thermal loads through a 10-node wall were simulated, while the location of both sensible and phase-change thermal mass was varied. Based on these results, a design strategy for locating PCM within building components to minimize thermal load transmission is proposed. The strategy matches the PCM melt/freeze temperature to the average temperature in the component and favors interior locations where the diurnal temperature swings are smaller than the melt/freeze temperature range of the PCMs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0001-2505,,,,,,2006,112,,1,,,,509,+,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000238183500047,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cloud thickness and integrated liquid-water content show a clear decrease during the day from sunrise to sunset, increasing thereafter. The average liquid-water density in the cloud is closely related to the cloud thickness, decreasing as the cloud thickness decreases. The cloud-base height has a diurnal range of 150 +/- 30 m, rising from sunrise till midafternoon. The cloud-top height has a similar diurnal range of 130 +/- 30 m, but the main descent occurs in the late afternoon. Surface air temperature also increases at sunrise, directly in phase with the cloud-base lifting, and has a diurnal range of 2-degrees-C. The diurnal behavior of the cloud base appears to be consistent with model-predicted uncoupling of the cloud layer and the subcloud layer as the turbulent flux of moisture is inhibited by solar heating near the cloud base. Similarly, variation in surface air temperature is consistent with the inhibition of the turbulent flux of heat between the two layers, shielding the surface from the effect of longwave cooling from the cloud top.

Many studies have demonstrated that soil heat flux G is strongly correlated with net radiation R-n. However, methods to parameterize G based on this relationship typically do not account for the dependency of G on soil properties and ignore asymmetry in the diurnal variation of G relative to R-n. In this paper, the diurnal behavior of G as a function of R-n is examined for sparse cover and bare soil conditions, focusing on patterns of diurnal variation as well as on the effects of soil moisture and soil type. To this end, information from field data is combined with simulations from a multilayer, diffusion-based soil model over a range of soil conditions and vegetation densities. The results show that a relatively simple function can be used to capture the first-order diurnal covariation between G and R-n. Within this framework, soil moisture exerts an important control on this relationship. When soils make the transition from stage-1 (atmosphere limited) to stage-2 (soil limited) evaporation, the ratio of G to R-n tends to increase. Further, soils in stage-2 evaporation exhibit positive G later in the day relative to moist soils. Data from several field experiments show that the amplitude of diurnal surface temperature can be used to predict the magnitude and behavior of G/R-n by integrating the effects of soil type and moisture. Based on these results, a method to estimate G/R-n is proposed that provides a robust representation of G/R-n on hourly timescales for varying soil conditions.

At present, the distribution of shore pine in Alaska is restricted to coastal bogs and fens, likely by competition with Sitka spruce and Western hemlock. Monitoring of permanent plots as part of the United States Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program identified a recent loss of shore pine biomass in Southeast Alaska. The apparent loss of shore pine is concerning, because its presence adds a vertical dimension to coastal wetlands, which are the richest plant communities of the coastal temperate rainforest in Alaska. In this study, we examined the shore pine tree-ring record from a newly established plot network throughout Southeast Alaska and explored climate-growth relationships. We found a steep decline in shore pine growth from the early 1960s to the present. Random Forest regression revealed a strong correlation between the decline in shore pine growth and the rise in growing season diurnal minimum air temperature. Warm summer nights, cool daytime temperatures and a reduced diurnal temperature range are associated with greater cloud cover in Southeast Alaska. This suite of conditions could lead to unfavorable tree carbon budgets (reduced daytime photosynthesis and greater nighttime respiration) and/or favor infection by foliar pathogens, such as Dothistroma needle blight, which has recently caused widespread tree mortality on lodgepole pine plantations in British Columbia. Further field study that includes experimental manipulation (e.g., fungicide application) will be necessary to identify the proximal cause(s) of the growth decline.

This method, based on the measurement of the absorption of an infrared laser emission at specific wave lengths of the (CO2)-C-13 and (CO2)-C-12, allows the continuous monitoring of the two isotopologues. The concentrations of the two isotopologues in F-S were continuously monitored from June to November 2007 using chamber method and Keeling plots drawn from nocturnal accumulation of CO2 below the canopy. These TDLS measurements and isotope ratio mass spectrometer based Keeling plots gave very similar values of delta C-13(FS), showing the reliability of the TDLS system in this context.

The range of variation of delta C-13(FS) was of the same order of magnitude at both diurnal and seasonal scales. delta C-13(FS) observed in the field fluctuated between values of litter and of root respiration recorded during incubation, suggesting that temporal (and probably spatial) variations were associated with changes in the relative contribution of the two compartments during the day and during the season.",,,,,"Epron, Daniel/B-5093-2011; MARRON, NICOLAS/J-5965-2013","Epron, Daniel/0000-0001-9451-3437; plain, caroline/0000-0002-3624-1127",,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,1573-5036,,,,MAY,2009,318,1-2,,,,,137,151,,10.1007/s11104-008-9824-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-008-9824-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000265538000013,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Crozier, L",,,,"Crozier, L",,,Warmer winters drive butterfly range expansion by increasing survivorship,ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"As the climate warms, many species are moving to higher latitudes and elevations. However, range shifts can be caused by many factors. These factors are unknown in most cases. The specific role of climate in these dynamics needs study to better predict future consequences of global warming. This case study evaluates whether warming,is driving the northward range expansion of a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris). Recently colonized areas have warmed 2-4degreesC over the past 50 years. To assess the importance of climate change for population persistence in these areas, I compared population dynamics at two locations (at the current range edge and just inside the range) that differ by 2-3degreesC. Population growth rate at these two locations over two years was positively correlated with January mean and annual mean temperatures. To determine whether larval overwinter survivorship could explain this correlation, I transplanted larvae over winter to both sites. Larval survivorship was very low at both locations, but significantly lower at the range edge, probably because lower lethal temperatures frequently occurred there. To estimate the direct effect of cold stress on larval survivorship, I applied a previously derived hazard-rate model based on laboratory experiments. With input from field-measured daily mean temperature, the model accurately predicted transplant survivorship at both locations over two winters. Combined results from population and larval transplant analyses indicate that winter temperatures directly affect the persistence of A. campestris at its northern range edge, and that winter warming was a prerequisite for this butterfly's range expansion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,JAN,2004,85,1,,,,,231,241,,10.1890/02-0607,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/02-0607,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000188869000025,View Full Record in Web of Science

Repeated measurements of daily field metabolic rate (FMR) were made on 11 Meadow Voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus Ord.) by means of the doubly labelled water technique. The objective was to quantify the individual consistency of FMR by calculating the repeatability of successive measures on the same individuals. One more general goal was to test whether FMRs are sufficiently repeatable to be convenient for field studies of natural selection. 2. Voles were all non-reproductive females, 5-7-months old. They were maintained individually in outdoor enclosures 25 m(2) and were injected 1-3 times with doubly labelled water. Two to six measures of daily FMR were thus obtained per individual (x=4.09, SD=1.51, n=11) over a period of 42 days in July and August 1994. 3. Body mass and rate of change in body mass accounted for 31.6% of the observed variation in FMR; ground-temperature variations had no significant effect on FMR, probably owing to the small range of temperatures experienced by voles. 4. Repeatability of mass-corrected log(10) FMR measurements was low (r=0.261). This low repeatability was very consistent with the results of a previous study on consistency of mass-specific daily energy expenditures of caged pouched mice. 5. A partition of the total variance observed in mass-corrected FMR showed that 63.0% of the variance originated from differences within individuals, 27.6% from differences among individuals, and 9.4% from measurement error. FMR was not consistently higher or lower on the first or second day of measurement, indicating no clear effect of handling stress. 6. A practical implication of these results is that single measurements of daily field metabolic rates are not necessarily a good predictor of the average 24 h energy budget for a given individual. On a more theoretical basis, these results indicate that, although the ability of an animal to manage its energy economics may largely determine its selective value, daily FMR seems to be a poor candidate variable to relate this ability to individual fitness in experimental studies. 7. We suggest that future studies of repeatability of FMR should concentrate on energetically constraining periods. This would allow further evaluation of the potential role of interindividual differences in FMR as a tool for understanding evolutionary pathways that shaped energy economics of animals.",,,,,"Berteaux, Dominique/J-3276-2016","Berteaux, Dominique/0000-0003-2728-5985",,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,DEC,1996,10,6,,,,,751,759,,10.2307/2390510,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2390510,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996WJ55200009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using UV-transmitting filters as covers (ozone filter technique) a difference in UV-B irradiance of 20 to 29 % was simulated. This difference corresponds to a decrease in stratospheric ozone of about 12 % based on ambient ozone levels at Lisbon (Portugal). During the experimental season in 1990 the daily course of temperature ranged from T-min = 13.5 degrees C at night to T-max = 28 degrees C around midday, and in 1991 from T-min = 17.5 to T-max = 32 degrees C simulating an average diurnal temperature increase, which might be expected in the 21st century as a result of the greenhouse effect. Generally, sunflower and maize seedlings grown under T-max = 32 degrees C had increased growth parameters compared to seedlings grown under T-max = 28 degrees C. In both plant species fresh and dry weight as well as plant size and leaf area were increased as a result of reduced UV-B radiation at T-max 28 degrees C, but, with very few exceptions, not at T-max = 32 degrees C. Thus, the increase in temperature by 4 degrees C mainly compensated the reduced growth caused by increased UV-B radiation. The net photosynthetic rates of sunflower and maize seedlings based on leaf area exhibited higher or similar rates under enhanced UV-B radiation in comparison to the control plants. However, on a plant basis significant UV-B dependent decreases were observed. Increased growing temperature resulted in higher net photosynthetic rates per plant.

Cyclic daily fattening routines are very common in wintering small wild birds, and are thought to be the consequence of a trade-off between different environmental and state-dependent factors. According to theory, these trajectories should range from accelerated (i.e. mass increases exponentially towards dusk) when mass-dependent predation costs are the most important cause of mortality risk, to decelerated (i.e. the rate of mass gain is highest at dawn and decreases afterward) when starvation is the greater risk. 2. We examine if geographically separate populations of coal tits, wintering in Scotland and central Spain under contrasting photoperiods, show differences in their strategies of daily mass regulation. We describe population differences in wild birds under natural conditions, and experimentally search for interpopulation variation in diurnal body mass increase under common, manipulated, photoperiod conditions (LD 9 : 15 h vs. 7 : 17 h), controlling for temperature, food availability, predator pressure and foraging arena. 3. Winter diurnal mass gain of wild coal tits was more delayed towards the latter part of the daylight period in central Spain (i.e. the locality with longer winter days) than in Scotland. In both localities, the pattern was linked to the average mass at dawn, with mass increasing more rapidly in lighter birds. However, under the controlled photoperiod situation the pattern of daily mass gain was similar in both populations. Diurnal body mass gain was more accelerated at the end of the day, and the increase in body mass in the first hour of the day was considerably lower under the long (9 h) than under the short (7 h) photoperiod in both populations. 4. Wintering coal tits show patterns of mass gain through the day that are compatible with current theories of the costs and benefits of fat storage, with birds at lower latitudes (with longer winter days) having a greater tendency to delay mass gain until late in the day. The experimental study revealed that these patterns are plastic, with birds responding directly to the photoperiod that they experience, suggesting that they are continually making fine-scale adjustments to energy reserves on the basis of both inherent (e.g. state-dependent) and extrinsic cues.",,,,,"Metcalfe, Neil B./C-5997-2009; Carrascal, Luis M./B-8381-2008; Carrascal, Luis M./Q-2190-2016","Metcalfe, Neil B./0000-0002-1970-9349; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Carrascal, Luis M./0000-0003-1288-5531; Vicente, Polo/0000-0002-0994-5372",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,SEP,2007,76,5,,,,,866,872,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01270.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2007.01270.x,,,,,,,,17714264,,,,,WOS:000249088900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few studies have directly linked the recruitment and growth of juvenile trees to climate warming to investigate the processes underlying climate-induced alpine treeline shift. On the cold-humid Changbai Mountain of northeastern China, almost no tree recruitment occurred above the current treeline on the west side before 1985, whereas considerable recruitment has occurred since 1985. To investigate whether this recent recruitment was caused by warming temperatures, we established a 450 m x 50 m permanent plot above the current alpine treeline. We used dendrochronology to reconstruct the time series of recruitment of Betula ermanii juveniles. In addition, we used open top chambers (OTCs) to increase the growing season day-time temperature by c. 2.8 degrees C and thereby to study the growth responses of juvenile trees to future warmer conditions beyond the current treeline. We found that tree recruitment increased substantially during a period of warmer summer temperatures since 1985, showing a high sensitivity of tree recruitment to temperature above the alpine treeline. The daily stem radial increment recorded by dendrometers was significantly (p <= 0.05) positively correlated with temperature but negatively correlated with soil water content, indicating no water limitation. Correspondingly, the increase in radial growth in OTCs was primarily a consequence of higher temperatures, especially in July. The regression slope between stem radial growth and temperature in the OTCs did not differ from that in ambient controls, indicating that the sensitivity of stem radial growth to temperature was not altered by warming. These suggest that future climate warming will induce increases in tree recruitment and growth above the alpine treeline. Our results revealed a direct link between temperature and recruitment and growth of juvenile trees, and that climate warming will likely cause forests to advance beyond the alpine treeline.",,,,,"Li, Mai-He/L-6390-2013","Li, Mai-He/0000-0002-7029-2841; Du, Haibo/0000-0001-6195-085X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1923,1873-2240,,,,JUL 15,2021,304,,,,,,,,108403,10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108403,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108403,,MAR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000652014300022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experimental results obtained in a companion paper led to the hypothesis that the observed bulk dielectric permittivity (epsilon(b)) is determined by an interplay between two competing phenomena: (1) the reduction in the dielectric permittivity of bulk water with increased T; and (2) the increase in TDR-measured epsilon(b) with increased T due to release of bound water. In this study we develop a physically based model for the temperature dependency of TDR-measured soil bulk dielectric permittivity and propose practical correction factors. The model considers the modified properties of water near solid surfaces to define a layer of rotationally hindered water (within the TDR frequency bandwidth) having a temperature dependent thickness. Changes in measured epsilon(b)(T) are thus attributed to variations in the thickness of the rotationally hindered layer which has a lower dielectric permittivity than free water and hence is less visible to travel-time-based TDR waveform analyses. The model is sensitive to the soil specific surface area and the water content, both of which determine the ratio of bound to bulk soil water. Comparisons with experimental data covering a wide range of soils, water contents, and temperatures showed good agreement. Further studies are needed to evaluate some of the model's critical parameters such as the cutoff frequency below which water is considered bound. A temperature correction approximation is based on analytical expressions for TDR-measured bulk dielectric permitivity and requires estimates of soil specific surface area and bulk density, which may be estimated from soil texture. The thermodielectric sensitivity of TDR-measured bulk dielectric permittivity and water content may serve as a basis for estimating soil specific surface area.",,,,,"Or, Dani/D-8768-2012","Or, Dani/0000-0002-3236-2933",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,,,,,FEB,1999,35,2,,,,,371,383,,10.1029/1998WR900008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1998WR900008,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000078220800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a series of experiments, seeds were subjected to a range of temperatures (nine between 5 degreesC and 37 degreesC), light (white, red, far-red, and dark), and hydration (4-70 g H2O 100 g(-1) FW) during stratification for up to 80 d. Samples were germinated periodically at 25/15 degreesC or constant 15, 20, or 25 degreesC with a 12 h photoperiod to determine dormancy status. Dark-stratification was an alternative, but not equivalent dormancy release mechanism to dry after-ripening in annual ryegrass seeds. Dormancy release during dark-stratification caused a gradual increase in sensitivity to light, but germination in darkness remained negligible. Germination, but not dormancy release, was greater under fluctuating diurnal temperatures than the respective mean temperatures delivered constantly. Dormancy release rate was a positive linear function of dark-stratification temperature above a base temperature for dormancy release of 6.9 degreesC. Dormancy release at temperatures up to 30 degreesC could be described in terms of thermal dark-stratification time, but the rate of dormancy release was slower at less than or equal to15 degreesC (244 degreesCd/probit increase in germination) than greater than or equal to20 degreesC (208 degreesCd/probit). Stratification in red or white, but not far-red light, inhibited dormancy release, as did insufficient (<40 g H2O 100 g(-1) FW) seed hydration.

However, few experiments have examined the drivers of differentiation among populations in asexual land plants with limited dispersal potential. Here, we evaluated the role of temperature in driving population differentiation in an asexual, obligate gametophyte fern species. METHODS: We reciprocally transplanted Vittaria appalachiana gametophytes among six populations that spanned the species' geographic range in the Appalachian Mountains and Plateau. Temperature, survival, and senescence rates were measured for 1 year. KEY RESULTS: Populations had significantly different fitness responses to different sites, consistent with the hypothesis that populations have differentiated across the species' range. There was some evidence for local adaptation in marginal populations and for countergradient selection favoring particularly robust genotypes at the northern range edge. Most populations had relatively high fitness at the site with the most stable temperature conditions and were negatively affected by decreasing minimum temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Populations of Vittaria appalachiana exhibit highly variable responses to transplantation across the species' range, and only a small subset of these responses are due to local adaptation. Differences in daily minimum temperature explain some variation in fitness, but other site-specific factors also have significant impacts on transplant fitness. These results indicate that asexual, patchily distributed species with limited dispersal may exhibit population-specific responses to global climate change that have not been elucidated by empirical work focused on sexually reproducing angiosperms.",,,,,,"Chambers, Sally/0000-0003-1029-1166; EMERY, NANCY/0000-0003-0278-514X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9122,1537-2197,,,,JAN,2016,103,1,,,,,86,98,,10.3732/ajb.1500077,http://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1500077,,,,,,,,26758887,,,,,WOS:000368561500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results Cycle 1 mean temperatures within control steel and polymer lockboxes were 31.8oC (range, 18.4-44.1oC) and 37.2oC (range, 27.1-46.7oC), respectively. The addition of 2 cold packs at 4:00 pm reduced mean temperatures to 29.1oC (range, 19.1-37.2oC) and 25.3oC (range, 20.0-31.6oC) in steel and polymer boxes, respectively. Cycle 2 mean temperatures within control steel and polymer lockboxes were 28.3oC (range, 22.4-40.8oC) and 31.6oC (range, 23.8-41.0oC), respectively. The addition of 4 ice packs at 8:00 am and replacement with 4 cold packs at 4:00 pm reduced mean temperatures to 24.3oC (range, 17.4-27.9oC) and 13.4oC (range, 6.6-18.1oC) in steel and polymer boxes, respectively.

Therefore, the rapid SST change due to the passage of tropical cyclones (TCs) is thought to cause biases. Here, the biases in the R-MGD with respect to in-situ observations were quantified along the passage of TCs in the western North Pacific. First, we examined a case study on the approach of three successive TCs in August-September 2020. The R-MGD had positive biases of > 2 degrees C just after the passage of three TCs, and negative biases were observed after one week of the last TC's passage. The comparison of the R-MGD with a moored buoy indicates that the biases can be explained by short-term fluctuations filtered out and the SST prior to the analysis time in R-MGD analysis. Second, the composite analysis from May 2015-October 2020 indicates that the statistically significant biases at the observation points ranged between -1 days and +4 days for positive biases and between +7 days and +14 days for negative biases relative to the time of the closest approach of a TC within 500 km. The positive SST bias is largely associated with cold subsurface water and intense TCs, being pronounced in the mid-latitude, except around the Kuroshio and Kuroshio extension regions. The assimilation of in-situ observations recorded within 72 h prior to the R-MGD analysis time through additional optimal interpolation alleviates these biases because this process redeems short-time-scale fluctuations. The impact on TC forecasts and the validity of the optimal interpolation experiment against the independent observations were also investigated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0026-1165,2186-9057,,,,APR,2022,100,2,,,,,321,341,,10.2151/jmsj.2022-016,http://dx.doi.org/10.2151/jmsj.2022-016,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000789037200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the example of Daphnia, we experimentally proved the assumption that the decrease in the motor activity of the ectotherms in the selected temperature range is a behaviour mechanism typical for thermal selection. The experiment was conducted on the offspring of one parthenogenetic female (pure line) of a laboratory culture maintained over several years at room temperature. The Daphnia individuals had been beforehand acclimated over several generations to 23.4 degrees C, and then were placed in a thermogradient apparatus. The control individuals were maintained at room temperature. The final temperature preference was determined using the so-called chronic method, when the tested organisms are maintained in a thermogradient apparatus over several days. The positions of the Daphnia individuals were recorded daily during 24 days. As a parameter which would characterize the motor activity of Daphnia, we used the parameter of average relative shifting, which was calculated as a difference (in cm) between the position they were found in two sequential records, divided by time (in min) between these records. Over the first 3 days, in the conditions of the temperature gradient, the Daphnia mostly selected heightened temperatures (24-28 degrees C). During the period from the 4th to 24th day, 74% of the Daphnia selected the range of 1823 degrees C and 85% -17-24 degrees C. Thus, the range of the ultimate selected temperatures decreased by 4 degrees C compared to the initially selected temperatures and enlarged by 3 degrees C towards the lower temperatures. In the thermogradient apparatus, the parthenogenetic females had the lowest value of the mean relative movement. In the control, at room temperature, this parameter of the adults was by 43% higher compared to the gradient. The pattern of the dynamic of the indicator in both variants of the experiment was similar for the periods and phases of fluctuations. With the juveniles the value of the parameter of mean relative shifting in the gradient was higher by 40% compared to the adult Daphnia, but close to the parameter of the adults in the control. We determined a relationship between the juveniles selecting the higher temperatures and higher mean relative shifting, which indicates a relationship between the behavioural selective reaction of juvenile Daphnia and general physiological condition of their organism. During the absence of the temperature gradient, the Daphnia were observed to show symmetry in their motor reaction. Occurrence of the asymmetry of the motor reaction of the Daphnia in the condition of the thermogradient, manifesting in the prevalence of shifting to lower or higher temperatures, can indicate more clearly manifested search reaction in the condition of a non-uniform environment.",,,,,"Poddubnaya, Nadezhda Ya/H-7637-2018; , Verbitskii/AAD-5232-2020","Poddubnaya, Nadezhda Ya/0000-0001-9109-1363; , Verbitskii/0000-0002-0255-3800",,,,,,,,,,,,,2310-0842,2312-301X,,,,,2018,26,2,,,,,111,116,,10.15421/011817,http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/011817,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000442249000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The specific parameters required for a protective thermoprofile are poorly understood, because most studies test a limited range of thermoprofiles. For example, thermoprofiles with a wave profile may perform better than a square profile, but these two profiles are rarely compared. In this study, two developmental stages of the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, eye-pigmented pupae, and emergence-ready adults, were exposed to one of eight thermoprofiles for up to 8 weeks. All the thermoprofiles had a base of 6 degrees C and a peak temperature of either 12 degrees C or 18 degrees C. The duration at peak temperature varied depending on the shape of the thermoprofile, either square or wave form. Two other treatments acted as controls, a constant 6 degrees C and a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) with a base temperature of 6 degrees C that was interrupted daily by a single, 1-h pulse at 20 degrees C. Compared with constant 6 degrees C, all the test thermoprofiles significantly improved survival. Compared with the FTR control, the thermoprofiles with a peak temperature of 18 degrees C outperformed the 12 degrees C profiles. Bees in the eye-pigmented stage exposed to the 18 degrees C profiles separated into two groups based on the shape of the profile, with higher survival in the square profiles compared with the wave profiles. Bees in the emergence-ready stage exposed to 18 degrees C profiles all had significantly higher survival than bees in the FTR controls. Counter to expectations, the least ecologically relevant thermoprofiles (square) had the highest survival rates and blocked the development of sub-lethal effects (delayed emergence).",,,,,,"Rajamohan, Arun/0000-0003-1587-2891",,,,,,,,,,,,,1540-7063,1557-7023,,,,OCT,2019,59,4,,,,,1089,1102,,10.1093/icb/icz126,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icb/icz126,,,,,,,,31270534,,,,,WOS:000491253900032,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results indicate that undisturbed community and soil respiration have apparent daily variation laws, daily variation patterns of respiration fluxes during different phenological phases are basically the same, and the variations of environmental factors only exert effect on CO2 emission intensities, while the effect on daily variation pattern of grassland CO2 emission fluxes is relatively small. The daily total respiration of the undisturbed community in different phenological phases ranges from 1.34-10.13 g(.)m(-2); soil daily total respiration ranges from 0.98-5.17 g(.)m(-2); both daily variations of undisturbed community and soil respiration fluxes are significantly correlated (p < 0.05) or extremely significantly correlated (p < 0.01) with air temperatures and ground surface temperatures, but the correlativity with the soil temperature at 5 and 10 cm depths is relatively weak; multiple regression analysis indicates that about 80% of the difference in daily respiration of the undisturbed community among different phenological phases is induced by the variation of the aboveground biomass, while the variations of the remaining factors can jointly explain around 20% of the daily respiration variations of the whole grassland ecosystem; about 83% of the soil daily respiration variation of the different phenological phases is caused by 0-20 cm underground biomass.

Observations indicate an ELR of -4.5 K center dot km(-1) in the region, lower than the commonly used -6.5 K center dot km(-1). ERA5 ELR agrees with the observational estimates, with some overestimation in winter and limitations in the diurnal variability. The elevation correction of ERA5 temperature using different ELR showed the benefits of deriving ELR fields from ERA5 vertical profiles, when compared with a constant ELR. Simulations with the ECMWF land surface model, at 9-km resolution, driven by ERA5 using different ELR corrections showed the added value of the methodology, but the impact of different ELR corrections is limited. However, the validity of the downscaling method in reducing temperature to station altitude suggests that there is sufficient generality for application at kilometer and subkilometer resolutions. By comparing the estimated representativity errors of observations with reanalysis, the improvements from ERAI to ERA5 are mainly visible in the random component of the error.

Based on DFA, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) was proposed to give a full description of more complicated time series. However, the removal of local trends in DFA is based on discontinuous polynomial fitting. It has been shown that oscillations in the fluctuation function and significant errors in crossover locations can be introduced in actual implementations. In terms of time series, it is generally natural that points near in time are more related than points some distance apart. Such principles can help us circumvent the above problems in the detrending step of MF-DFA. Based on this rationale, the ideas of moving windows and weighted moving windows are proposed for smoothing the log-log plot of the fluctuation function F(s) versus the scale s so that local effects can be taken into consideration and crossover timescales, particularly large timescales, can be effectively detected. The multifractal moving-window detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-MWDFA) and the more general multifractal temporally weighted detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-TWDFA) are proposed in this paper. Numerical simulations and the analysis of a real-life daily temperature time series are performed in order to substantiate the arguments and evaluate the performance. With the help of MF-TWDFA, two more crossover points, which cannot be found by the conventional MF-DFA, have been found in the annual-detrended temperature series by the proposed model. The crossover timescales appear to correspond rather closely with the actual variation of temperature over time under different climate regimes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1742-5468,,,,,JUN,2010,,,,,,,,,P06021,10.1088/1742-5468/2010/06/P06021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/2010/06/P06021,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000281744100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The chief objectives were to determine the daily energy intake and growth of piscivorous brown trout (Salmo trutta), and to compare the observed values with those expected from models developed previously for brown trout feeding on freshwater invertebrates. Energy budgets for individual fish were obtained from experiments with 40 trout (initial live weight 250-318 g) bred from wild parents, and kept at five constant temperatures (5, 10, 13, 15, 18 degrees C) and 100% oxygen saturation. Each trout was fed to satiation on freshly killed sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) over a period of 42 days. 2. Energy intake (C-IN cal day(-1)) and growth (C-G cal day(-1)) were measured directly and energy losses (C-Q cal day(-1)) were estimated by difference (C-Q = C-IN - C-G). All three variables increased with temperature. A model previously used to predict the daily energy intake (C-IN(INV)) of trout feeding to satiation on invertebrates was adapted, by changing only one parameter, to provide an excellent model (R-2 = 0.998) for predicting the mean daily energy intake (C-IN(ST)) for the piscivorous trout. Values of C-IN(ST) were 58% (range 48-67%) higher than those for C-IN(INV). A simple model was also developed to estimate mean daily energy losses for piscivorous trout (R-2 = 0.999). Both models were combined to provide excellent estimates of the daily energy gain (growth) of the piscivorous trout, and this was about three times that for trout feeding on invertebrates. The optimum temperature for maximum growth in energy terms increased from 13.9 degrees C for trout feeding on invertebrates to 17.0 degrees C (range 16.6-17.4 degrees C) for piscivorous trout. 3. The models are basically an extension of those developed for trout feeding on invertebrates. They show clearly how energy intake, growth, and the optimum temperature for growth increase markedly when trout change their diet from invertebrates to fish. The implications of this are discussed and it is shown that, in theory, these increases should continue if a more energy-rich diet was utilised by the trout.",,,,,"Hurley, Margaret A/A-8875-2013","Hurley, Margaret A/0000-0002-2502-432X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,JUN,2000,44,2,,,,,237,245,,10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00560.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00560.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000087864300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model is most successful in predicting the meridional wind phase and magnitude throughout the altitude range of 95-145 km. Although the model can also predict the overall pattern of zonal wind and temperature, its daytime eastward wind exceeds the observations by about 35 m/s at 105 km and its temperature deviation from mean is typically 3 times smaller than the observations, The overestimation of the eastward meanflow in the model is likely associated with an overestimation in gravity wave forcing which prevents the propagation of the diurnal tide to 100 km, The diurnal tide, which is quite substantial at 100 km from the radar measurement, deposits its momentum to enhance the westward meanflow [Miyahara and Wu, 1989]. One reason for the smaller simulated temperature fluctuation is that the current model does not include any semidiurnal forcing at the lower boundary (30 km). According to a recent study by Hagan [1996], water vapor absorption of solar near-infrared radiation in the troposphere can have a very large effect on the tides in the lower thermosphere. We further note that the observed semidiurnal tide experiences a fast growth rate at 105 km and saturates at slightly above 110 km, while the model prediction shows a much smaller growth rate in this region despite a much longer vertical wavelength, This suggests that the model may overestimate the molecular/eddy viscosity in the turbopause region. During the January 1993 period, the observed mean mesopause temperature, 160 K, is about 30 K colder than the model prediction and current prevailing beliefs. Although such a cold mesopause at a tropical latitude needs to be verified by more experiments, it cannot be precluded theoretically due to large uncertainties in radiative and dynamical heating/cooling rates, most particularly the radiative cooling rate from CO2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1,1997,102,A6,,,,,11507,11519,,10.1029/97JA00439,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97JA00439,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XD97400023,View Full Record in Web of Science

A series of forecasts initialized daily for 47 days during the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA-COARE) period are performed with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) provided by persistence of initial conditions, and coupling to either a full dynamical ocean model with vertical resolution in the upper ocean typical of coupled models (10m), or, a 1D mixed layer ocean model with high (similar to 1 m) vertical resolution in the upper ocean. The experiment with the full dynamical model shows improved skill compared with the persisted SST experiment, indicating role for coupled processes in the MJO. The experiment with the mixed layer model shows a further improvement in skill over the full dynamical ocean, particularly for the phases of the MJO where the convection is active over the Indian Ocean or West Pacific. This further improvement comes about from an enhanced sensitivity of the SST to the surface flux anomalies associated with the MJO. Additional sensitivity experiments reveal that the improved representation of the diurnal cycle which results from the increased vertical resolution is a significant factor in the improved skill of the experiments with the mixed layer model.

J,"Blanke, MM",,,,"Blanke, MM",,,Soil respiration in an apple orchard,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,,,,,,,,,,,,"To investigate why the largest CO2 concentration occurred before sunrise at 0.6 m below an apple tree canopy, seasonal and diurnal fluctuations in soil and grass respiration were recorded in an apple orchard near Bonn, Germany between May 1994 and April 1995 with a portable, battery-driven infrared gas analyser and a soil respiration chamber. Respiration from soil on raised nursery beds with fresh organic matter was compared with herbicide treated, flat soil in tree rows and the grass between the rows to study the contribution of soil and grass respiration to the CO2 balance of a fruit orchard. The following results were found. 1. Soil and grass respiration ranged from 0.18 to 24 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). 2. On cold winter days, with soil temperatures below 0 degrees C, soil and grass respiration during the day remained below 0.6 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and had the smallest diurnal variation. 3. The largest diurnal variations were in late spring with diurnal temperature differences of 15 degrees C, resulting in respiratory values between 3 in the morning and 5-8 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in the afternoon. 4. Soil and grass respiration (up to 40 kg CO2 ha(-1) hr(-1)) exceeded the CO2 exchange of the apple trees per unit surface area, contributed significantly to the CO2 flux in a fruit orchard, and were a pertinent source of CO2 for tree photosynthesis. 5. The temperature coefficient, Q(10), ranged from 4 below 0 degrees C, to 2.3 above 0 degrees C, 1.7 above 10 degrees C and 1.3 above 20 degrees C.",,,,,"Blanke, Michael/D-2231-2018","Blanke, Michael/0000-0003-1593-4124",,,,,,,,,,,,,0098-8472,,,,,OCT,1996,36,3,,,,,339,&,,10.1016/0098-8472(96)01003-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0098-8472(96)01003-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VJ70900010,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is difficult to acquire satellite LSTs with both high spatial and temporal resolutions due to tradeoffs between them. Thus, various algorithms/models have been developed to enhance the spatial or the temporal resolution of thermal infrared (TIR) data or LST, but rarely both. The Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) is the widely-used data fusion algorithm for Landsat and MODIS imagery to produce Landsat-like surface reflectance. In order to extend the STARFM application over heterogeneous areas, an enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) approach was proposed by introducing a conversion coefficient and the spectral unmixing theory. The aim of this study is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the ESTARFM algorithm for generating ASTER-like daily LST by three approaches: simulated data, ground measurements and remote sensing products, respectively. The datasets of LST ground measurements, MODIS, and ASTER images were collected in an arid region of Northwest China during the first thematic HiWATER-Multi-Scale Observation Experiment on Evapotranspiration (MUSOEXE) over heterogeneous land surfaces in 2012 from May to September. Firstly, the results of the simulation test indicated that ESTARFM could accurately predict background with temperature variations, even coordinating with small ground objects and linear ground objects. Secondly, four temporal ASTER and MODIS data fusion LSTs (i.e., predicted ASTER-like LST products) were highly consistent with ASTER LST products. Here, the four correlation coefficients were greater than 0.92, root mean square error (RMSE) reached about 2 K and mean absolute error (MAE) ranged from 1.32 K to 1.73 K. Finally, the results of the ground measurement validation indicated that the overall accuracy was high (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.77 K), and the ESTARFM algorithm is a highly recommended method to assemble time series images at ASTER spatial resolution and MODIS temporal resolution due to LST estimation error less than 1 K. However, the ESTARFM method is also limited in predicting LST changes that have not been recorded in MODIS and/or ASTER pixels.",,,,,"Li, Hua/S-3644-2018; Weng, Qihao/Q-5323-2019; Weng, Qihao/L-6140-2013","Weng, Qihao/0000-0002-2498-0934; Yang, Guijun/0000-0002-6425-8321; Gao, Feng/0000-0002-1865-2846",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2072-4292,,,,JAN,2016,8,1,,,,,,,75,10.3390/rs8010075,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs8010075,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000369494500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two experiments were designed: (1) at constant temperature regimens and (2) under diurnal temperature regimens ranging from 24-25 degrees C to 34-35 degrees C. At 24-25 degrees C egg hatching success was 98% at 48h, however at 34-35 degrees C egg hatching rates declined to 1.6% after 48h. Ae. aegypti larvae reared under constant temperature regimens showed pupation on day 4 with highest pupation occurring at 30 degrees C (78.4%) However, under diurnal temperature regimens, pupation began on day 4 but only at the higher temperatures of 30-35 degrees C. Under diurnal temperature regimens ranging from 24 degrees C to 35 degrees C significantly more females emerged at higher temperatures, than males. In contrast, at constant temperatures of 24-35 degrees C no significant difference in M/F ratios were observed. The body size of Ae. aegypti reared at constant temperature regimens was significantly larger than males and females larvae reared under diurnal temperature regimens of 25-30 degrees C. The results of this study are discussed in the context of changing or increasing water temperatures, seasonal changes in vector populations and vector competence. Using these key factors control strategies are recommended to manage vector populations as expected increases in temperatures impact the Caribbean region. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the importance of this property, many means have been proposed to derive the Z factor parameter such as through Experimental analysis, Equation of state and Empirical correlations. For correlations, both implicit correlations and explicit correlations have been modelled in order to best measure this deviation. However, the explicit correlation has not considered pseudo reduced temperature of less than 1. This study analyzed previous correlations in order to gain knowledge on their working conditions, limitations, and methods of derivations. A quick and dependable approach in modeling Z factor correlation from the pseudo reduced temperature and pressure was adopted. The study proposed a new and accurate correlation that can be employed in daily calculations that is an extension of Beggs-Brill Correlation (BBC), Azizi-Behbahani-Isazadeh Correlation (ABIC) and Sanjari-Lay Correlation (SLC). The composite correlation technique led to the derivation of 3 new equations for gas compressibility factor. A regression analysis was run to see how far the new correlations deviated from the previous ones and two of the correlations proved to be conforming to the Standing and Katz model as well as the other base correlations used. The result obtained from the 3 new correlations were then validated with field data. The type of natural gas worked with was a binary mixture of methane and decane components.

Unfortunately, numerous nuisances in the control of temperature for plants ren-ders most commercially available controllers unsuitable or too expensive. Here we describe a simple to use but comprehensive temperature controller for plant growth exper-iments in enclosed spaces like nurseries or chambers. The device uses Pulse Width Modulation to control independent cooling and heating elements over a broad range of amperages, which minimizes or eliminates temperature overshoot and ensures precise and accurate temperature control (i.e., sensor accuracy = 0.1 degrees C; controller accuracy = 0.3 degrees C.). The device incorporates an internal clock for controlling temperature (and growth lights) concurrent with diurnal cycles, and it has an integrated Wi-Fi chip to transfer sensor data to a web-page, where data are displayed in real time. The device uses off-the-shelf parts and can be built for around $USD63. The controller can be integrated with other reported controllers (e.g., soil moisture and CO2) to produce an affordable multi-system controller necessary for complex factorial experiments, which hopefully can help to accel-erate our understanding about the impacts of climatic variables on plant performance.

J.",,,Estimating daily solar radiation in New Zealand using air temperatures,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF CROP AND HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"The amount of solar radiation received at the earth's surface (R-s, MJ m(-2) day(-1)) sets the potential for crop growth, is a key driver of evapotranspiration and, consequently, is an important input variable for crop simulation models. However, values for R-s are seldom included in historical weather records. This paper assesses two methods proposed to estimate R-s as the product of extraterrestrial radiation (R-a) and a transmissivity coefficient (T-t), using data from 10 New Zealand sites (37.5 degrees S-46.1 degrees S). Both the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) and the Weiss et al. (WS) models use the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperature (Delta T) to estimate T-t. The HS model uses the square root of Delta T and a single empirical coefficient, k. Reported values of k are 0.16 for continental and 0.19 for coastal locations. The WS model uses the AT squared and a single empirical coefficient, b, to estimate R-s. Reported values of b range between 0.20 and 0.75. The current research used a sensitivity analysis of k and b to determine the accuracy of the two models at the 10 sites and to determine the optimum values for the coefficients k and b. Sensitivity analyses showed the HS model gave more accurate estimates of R-s than the WS model. Root mean squared deviations (RMSD) were 2.43 and 3.50 (MJ m(-2)) across all 10 sites for the HS and WS models, respectively. The range of values of k in the HS model was 0. 14-0.17, which is typical of continental sites. The mean value (k = 0.15) is suggested as appropriate for other New Zealand sites. The range for b in the WS model was 0.35-0.65. The principal use for these estimated R-s values would be in crop simulation models. Therefore, a simulation analysis was undertaken with these data. This compared simulated wheat (Triticum aestivum) biomass and grain yields with measured yields from an experiment at Lincoln, New Zealand. Simulations used observed R-s values and those estimated with the HS and WS models. Simulated biomass and grain yields from the HS model were virtually identical to those using the observed Rs data, whereas those from the WS model were 5-6% less accurate.",,,,,"Fletcher, Andrew L/J-7183-2013; Fletcher, Andrew/G-3915-2010","Fletcher, Andrew L/0000-0003-1236-2319; ",,,,,,,,,,,,,0114-0671,1175-8783,,,,MAR,2007,35,1,,,,,147,157,,10.1080/01140670709510179,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01140670709510179,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000248331900018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The FIRE I experiment, conducted off the coast of California, provided a comprehensive observational set of data on marine stratocumulus during July 1987. The observations reported in this paper and used as a basis for comparison with the ERA results include the mean diurnal variation of cloud cover, liquid water path, cloud-base and cloud-top height, incoming shortwave and longwave radiation at the surface, and monthly mean vertical profiles of (potential) temperature and specific humidity. It is concluded that the ERA thermal structure in the boundary layer is quite realistic and the ERA data reveal some diurnal variability. However, in ERA the cloud thickness is overestimated and cloud cover and liquid water path are strongly underestimated as compared with the FIRE I observations. As a result the ERA downwelling shortwave radiation at the surface is much larger than observed in FIRE I. It is argued that the large difference between the ERA downwelling shortwave radiation at the surface and that observed in FIRE I can lead to large biases in the sea surface temperature in a coupled ocean-atmosphere model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0894-8755,1520-0442,,,,,2001,14,7,,,,,1466,1478,,10.1175/1520-0442(2001)014<1466:COTERW>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(2001)014<1466:COTERW>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000167872600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examined how adaptive colony responses to changing ambient temperature are achieved through the in-nest workers' behavioral plasticity. We studied three Bombus huntii colonies in the laboratory. In the first experiment, we manipulated ambient temperature and recorded brood cell incubation and wing fanning by individually marked, known-age bees. The colonies maintained their nests closer to appropriate brood development temperatures (28 to 32 degrees C) when exposed to a range of ambient temperatures from 10.3 to 38.6 degrees C. Incubation activity was greater in cooler treatment conditions, whereas in the highest temperature treatment, some bees fanned and others moved off the brood. As the ambient temperature dropped, workers increased the duration of their incubating bouts, but, except at the highest temperature, the number of workers that incubated did not differ significantly among treatments. A subset of the bees incubated significantly more than their nest mates, some of which never incubated. Worker body size, but not age, was a good predictor of incubation rates, and smaller bees incubated at higher rates. In the second experiment, we removed the most actively incubating workers. Immediately after removals, the total colony incubation effort was lower than pre-removal levels, but incubation effort rebounded toward pre-removal levels after 24 h. The increased thermoregulatory demand after removals was met primarily by bees increasing their rates of incubation rather than by bees switching from a different task to incubation. We conclude that some B. huntii workers specialize on nest thermoregulation, and that changes in work rates are more important than task switching in meeting thermal challenges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5443,1432-0762,,,,MAR,2007,61,5,,,,,783,792,,10.1007/s00265-006-0309-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-006-0309-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000244684500014,View Full Record in Web of Science

An average thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of 3.1 was estimated for the round stingray across the range of experimental temperatures. Estimations of size dependent Q(10) was 3.8 in juveniles while 2.6 in adults. Our model showed a negative relationship between this species mass-specific scaling exponent (b) and temperature (b = 0.99 at 15 degrees C, b = 0.86 at 23 degrees C, and b = 0.79 at 27 degrees C). Results indicate that the round stingray is relatively sensitive to the thermal fluctuations they experience in southern California. While adults with a relatively high metabolic Q(10) may optimize their daily net energy gain by exploiting the local thermal heterogeneity, a higher thermal sensitivity in juveniles could have adverse effects on the population fitness under a pervasive increase of ocean's temperature.

The impact of uncertainties in the forcing irradiances on simulations of snow is evaluated in idealized modeling experiments. Two snow models of contrasting complexity, the Utah Energy Balance Model (UEB) and the Snow Thermal Model (SNTHERM), are forced with irradiances with prescribed errors of the structure and magnitude representative of those found in methods for estimating the downwelling irradiances. Relatively modest biases have substantial impacts on simulated snow water equivalent (SWE) and surface temperature (T-s) across a range of climates, whereas random noise at the daily scale has a negligible effect on modeled SWE and T-s. Shortwave biases have a smaller SWE impact, due to the influence of albedo, and T-s impact, due to their diurnal cycle, compared to equivalent longwave biases. Warmer sites exhibit greater sensitivity to errors when evaluated using SWE, while colder sites exhibit more sensitivity as evaluated using T-s. The two models displayed different sensitivity and responses to biases. The stability feedback in the turbulent fluxes explains differences in T-s between models in the negative longwave bias scenarios. When the models diverge during melt events, differences in the turbulent fluxes and internal energy change of the snow are found to be responsible.

Airborne campaigns over two years were conducted with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) over an orchard field to investigate changes in PRI, in the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI) normalized by the Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) (TCARI/OSAVI), and in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as function of field-measured physiological indicators of water stress, such as stomatal conductance, stem water potential, steady-state fluorescence, and crown temperature. The AHS sensor was flown at three times on each 2004 and 2005 years, collecting 2 m spatial resolution imagery in 80 spectral bands in the 0.43-12.5 mu m spectral range. Indices PRI, TCARI/OSAVI, and NDVI were calculated from reflectance bands, and thermal bands were assessed for the retrieval of land surface. temperature, separating pure crowns from shadows and sunlit soil pixels. The Photochemical Reflectance Index, originally developed for xanthophyll cycle pigment change detection was calculated to assess its relationship with water stress at a canopy level, and more important, to assess canopy structural and viewing geometry effects for water stress detection in diurnal airborne experiments. The FLIGHT 3D canopy reflectance model was used to simulate the bi-directional reflectance changes as function of the viewing geometry, background and canopy structure. This manuscript demonstrates that the airborne-level PRI index is sensitive to the de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll pigment cycle caused by water stress levels, but affected diurnally by the confounding effects of BRDF. Among the three vegetation indices calculated, only airborne PRI demonstrated sensitivity to diurnal changes in physiological indicators of water stress, such as canopy temperature minus air temperature (Tc-Ta), stomatal conductance (G), and stem water potential (psi) measured in the field at the time of each image acquisition. No relationships were found from the diurnal experiments between NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI with the tree-measured physiological measures.

Measurements were taken by the Superconducting Submillimeter-wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES). This spectrally resolving radiometer, with very low observation noise and altitude range from the lower stratosphere to the lower thermosphere (20-100 km), was measuring vertical profiles of absorption spectra along a non-sun-synchronous orbit, thus observing at all local times. We used the retrieved volume mixing ratio profiles to compile climatologies that are a function of pressure, a horizontal coordinate (latitude or equivalent latitude), and a temporal coordinate (solar zenith angle or local solar time). The main product presented are climatologies with a high resolution of the temporal coordinate (diurnal variation climatologies). In addition, we provide climatologies with a high resolution of the horizontal coordinate (zonal climatologies). The diurnal variation climatologies are based on data periods of 2 months and the zonal climatologies on monthly data periods. Consideration of the SMILES time-space sampling patterns with respect to the averaging coordinates is a key issue for climatology creation, especially in case of diurnal variation climatologies. Biases induced by inhomogeneous sampling are minimized by carefully choosing the size of averaging bins. The sampling biases of the diurnal variation climatology of ClO and BrO are investigated in a comparison of homogeneously sampled model data versus SMILES-sampled model data from the stratospheric Lagrangian chemistry and transport model Alfred Wegener Institute Lagrangian Chemisrty/Transport System. In most cases, the relative sampling error is in the range of 0-20%. The strongest impact of sampling biases is found where the species' temporal gradients are strongest (mostly at sunrise and sunset), with a relative error of 60-100%.

The effects of agroforestry on microclimate and land surface temperatures (LST) remain largely unknown despite their central role in controlling abiotic and biotic factors and in buffering climate at a larger scale. We assessed spatial and temporal microclimate and LST variability in a biodiversity enrichment experiment, in which tree islands have been planted in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra (Indonesia). Four years after establishment of the experiment, we measured microclimate and LST using mini microclimate sensors and drone-recorded thermal images. We examined experimental effects of tree species richness (0, 1, 2, 3 or 6), plot size (25 m(2), 100 m(2), 400 m(2), 1600 m(2)) and stand structural complexity on microclimate and LST. Diurnal patterns showed ambient air temperature peaks and relative humidity (RH) minima at 3 pm, whereas diurnal soil temperatures peaked around 6 pm. The lowest LST were observed from oil palm canopy leaves and the highest from bare soils and understorey vegetation (including trees). Spatial and temporal ranges of ambient air temperature were smaller than LST ranges, and average ambient air temperature and LST were positively correlated. Tree species diversity had no overall significant effect neither on microclimate nor LST, but humidity was higher in planted tree islands compared to natural regeneration only. Smaller plots were characterized by higher mean air, soil and LST, compared to larger plots. Structurally complex plots were associated with low mean and maximum values of ambient air temperature, soil temperature and LST and high mean and minimum RH. Still, conditions were hotter and drier in several experimental plots compared to conventional oil palm plantations, considering a higher transpiration in the latest.

In this paper, we study an under-investigated problem range detection in a commodity RFID system, which aims to check if there are any tags with the data between an upper and lower boundary in a time-efficient way. This is important especially in a large RFID system, which can help users quickly pinpoint the target tags (if any) and give an early warning to users for taking urgent actions and reducing the potential risk in the nascent stage. We propose two tailored protocols, selective query and range query, to achieve range detection within the scope of the C1G2 standard. The novelty is that, instead of querying each tag, we exploit the capability of C1G2-compatible selection and quickly separate target tags from others by silencing most of tags. The final result is that range query is able to achieve a range detection with only one query command. We implement the proposed protocols in commodity RFID systems, with no need for any hardware modifications.

However, questions remain regarding flowering dates in the natural environment, such as the synchronous flowering of plants sown simultaneously at highly contrasting latitudes. The daily change in sunrise and sunset times is the cue for the flowering of trees and for the synchronization of moulting in birds at the equator. Sunrise and sunset also synchronize the cell circadian clock, which is involved in the regulation of flowering. The goal of this study was to update the photoperiodism model with knowledge acquired since its conception. Methods: A large dataset was gathered, including four 2-year series of monthly sowings of 28 sorghum varieties in Mali and two 1-year series of monthly sowings of eight rice varieties in the Philippines to compare with previously published monthly sowings in Japan and Malaysia, and data from sorghum breeders in France, Nicaragua and Colombia. An additive linear model of the duration in days to panicle initiation (PI) and flowering time using daylength and daily changes in sunrise and sunset times was implemented. Key Results: Simultaneous with the phyllochron, the duration to PI of field crops acclimated to the mean temperature at seedling emergence within the usual range of mean cropping temperatures. A unique additive linear model combining daylength and daily changes in sunrise and sunset hours was accurately fitted for any type of response in the duration to PI to the sowing date without any temperature input. Once calibrated on a complete and an incomplete monthly sowing series at two tropical latitudes, the model accurately predicted the duration to PI of the concerned varieties from the equatorial to the temperate zone. Conclusions: Including the daily changes in sunrise and sunset times in the updated photoperiodism model largely improved its accuracy at the latitude of each experiment.

Wesley",,,Elevated Salinity Rapidly Confers Cross-Tolerance to High Temperature in a Splash-Pool Copepod,INTEGRATIVE ORGANISMAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Synopsis Accurate forecasting of organismal responses to climate change requires a deep mechanistic understanding of how physiology responds to present-day variation in the physical environment. However, the road to physiological enlightenment is fraught with complications: predictable environmental fluctuations of any single factor are often accompanied by substantial stochastic variation and rare extreme events, and several factors may interact to affect physiology. Lacking sufficient knowledge of temporal patterns of co-variation in multiple environmental stressors, biologists struggle to design and implement realistic and relevant laboratory experiments. In this study, we directly address these issues, using measurements of the thermal tolerance of freshly collected animals and long-term field records of environmental conditions to explore how the splash-pool copepod Tigriopus californicus adjusts its physiology as its environment changes. Salinity and daily maximum temperature-two dominant environmental stressors experienced by T. californicus-are extraordinarily variable and unpredictable more than 2-3 days in advance. However, they substantially co-vary such that when temperature is high salinity is also likely to be high. Copepods appear to take advantage of this correlation: median lethal temperature of field-collected copepods increases by 7.5 degrees C over a roughly 120 parts-per-thousand range of ambient salinity. Complementary laboratory experiments show that exposure to a single sublethal thermal event or to an abrupt shift in salinity also elicits rapid augmentation of heat tolerance via physiological plasticity, although the effect of salinity dwarfs that of temperature. These results suggest that T. californicus's physiology keeps pace with the rapid, unpredictable fluctuations of its hypervariable physical environment by responding to the cues provided by recent sublethal stress and, more importantly, by leveraging the mechanistic cross-talk between responses to salinity and heat stress.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2517-4843,,,,AUG 22,2022,4,1,,,,,,,obac037,10.1093/iob/obac037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/iob/obac037,,,,,,,,36003414,,,,,WOS:000842650900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The amplitude of the fluctuations may affect the copepods' ability to respond to climate change.

Negative effects on copepods may affect the whole food web as they are the most abundant zooplankton, constituting a major part of the diet of fish. In this study, we determined the vertical profiles of an array of environmental variables and the vertical distribution of common copepods in a shallow coastal area of the Baltic Sea. We sampled once a month, in June, July and August, every sixth hour during 24 h. We found that copepods experience a change in pH of more than 0.5 units and 5 degrees C change in temperature during migration.

Typically, models of soil temperature are developed and validated for large geographic regions. However, modeling frameworks intended for higher spatial resolutions (much finer than 1km(2)) are lacking across areas of complex topography. Here we propose a simple modeling framework for predicting distributed soil temperature at high temporal (i.e., 1 h steps) and spatial (i.e., 5x5m) resolutions in mountainous terrain, based on a few discrete air temperature measurements. In this context, two steps were necessary to estimate the soil temperature. First, we applied the potential temperature equation to generate the air temperature distribution from a 5 m digital elevation model and Inverse Distance Weighting interpolation. Second, we applied a hybrid model to estimate the distribution of soil temperature based on the generated air temperature surfaces. Our results show that this approach simulated the spatial distribution of soil temperature well, with a root-mean-square error ranging from similar to 2.1 to 2.9 degrees C. Furthermore, our approach predicted the daily and monthly variability of soil temperature well.

Year-long temperature data from 28 sensors located at 3 different heights in the building was analysed to help understand the temperature distributions and indicate the temperatures below or above an assumed optimal temperature range, defined as between 14 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Relatively large variations in the spatial temperature distribution were found, and they were higher in the vertical direction than in the longitudinal direction. The temperatures measured in the AOZ at 0.25 m height, were on average, 7 degrees C warmer than that at 1.5 m height. The AOZ temperature correlated better with temperatures measured at 0.7 m or 1.5 m height in the same pen than with temperatures measured in the AOZ at other pens. The analyses show that a proportional-integral based control system effectively counteracts the effects of outdoor wind conditions, and the control system is capable of maintaining the defined optimal temperature at the measurement height.

This study examines the diurnal variations of CRF using the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) monthly hourly flux data and the flux data derived from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) using the Goddard Institute for Space Studies general circulation model radiation code. The results for the months of April, July, and October 1985 and January 1986 are analyzed. We found that, in general, two data sets agreed. For longwave (LW) CRF the diurnal range over land is generally greater than that observed over oceans. For the 4-month averages the ERBE values are 15.8 W m(-2) and 6.8 W m(-2) for land and ocean, respectively, compared with the ISCCP calculated values of 18.4 W m(-2) and 8.0 W m(-2), respectively. The land/ocean contrast is largely associated with changes in cloud amount and the temperature difference between surface and cloud top. It would be more important to note that the clear-sky flux (i.e., surface temperature) variabilities are shown to be a major contributor to the large variabilities over land. The maximum diurnal range is found to be in the summer hemisphere, and the minimum values in the winter hemisphere. It is also shown that the daytime maximum and the nighttime minimum are seen over large portions of land, whereas they occur at any local hour over most oceans. For shortwave (SW) CRF the daytime maximum values are about twice as large as monthly averages, and their highest frequency occurs at local noon, indicating that solar insolation is a primary factor for the diurnal variation of SW CRF.

In an experimental arena with zones at different climatic conditions, starved R. prolixus nymphs prefer a cooler and more humid zone, stopping there more often and for longer periods. This is probably a behavioural adaptation to limit water loss and reduce metabolic rate. In the Venezuelan State of Portuguesa, temperature and humidity were monitored in three kinds of potential refugia during the dry season: (i) in a palm roof; (ii) in a crack of the wall of a house; and (iii) in a palm tree crown. Fluctuations in temperature and saturation deficit are not very different inside and outside the palm roof except during a few hours of the day when the sun is at its zenith. In the crack of the wall, the diurnal temperature range is reduced to 6.5 degrees C compared with 12.4 degrees C outside, and the saturation deficit varies by only 7.6 hPa compared with 28.6 hPa outside. In the palm tree crown, the daily temperature range is only 4.2 degrees C compared with 13.8 degrees C outside, and the saturation deficit is permanently < 5 hPa. The micro-climatic conditions in the palm tree crown would appear to be ideal for starving R. prolixus, but this kind of refugium generally harbours low densities of bugs, probably related to a combination of predation, pathogens and lower mean temperature within the crown.

This study used the yield results from a long-term field experiment (1979-2012) at Luancheng Experimental Station in the central part of the North China Plain (NCP) to analyze the seasonal yield variation of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under the condition of sufficient water supply. The yield change of winter wheat over the last 33 growing seasons was divided into three time periods: the 1980s, the 1990s, and the years of 2001-2012. The grain yield of winter wheat during the 1980s was relative stable. During the 1990s, the annual yield of this crop was continuously increased by 193 kg/ha/year (P < 0.01). While for the past 12 years, yield of winter wheat was maintained at relative higher level, but with larger seasonal yield variation than that back in 1980s. CERES-Wheat model was calibrated and was used to verify the effects of management practices on grain yield. Seven scenarios were simulated with and without improvements in management. The simulated results show that the yield of winter wheat was decreased by 5.3% during 1990s and by 9.2% during the recent 12 seasons, compared with that during 1980s, under the scenario that the yield of winter wheat was solely affected by weather. Seasonal yield variation caused by weather factors was around -39% to 20%, indicating the great effects of weather on yearly yield variation. Yield improvement by cultivars was around 24.7% during 1990s and 52.0% during the recent 12 seasons compared with that during 1980s. The yield improvement by the increase in soil fertility and chemical fertilizer input was 7.4% and 6.8% during the two periods, respectively. The initial higher soil fertility and chemical fertilizer input might be the reasons that the responses of crop production to the further increase in chemical fertilizer were small during the simulation period. Correlation analysis of the grain yield from the field measured data with weather factors showed that sunshine hours and diurnal temperature difference (DTR) were positively, and relative humidity was negatively related to grain yield of winter wheat. The climatic change trends in this area showed that the DTR and sunshine hours were declining. This type of climatic change trend might further negatively affect winter wheat production in the future. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Under present climate, correcting the large underestimation of lake area in CESM1 (denoted CCSM4 in the configuration used here) caused 1 degrees C spring decreases and fall increases in surface air temperature throughout large areas of Canada and the US. Simulated summer surface diurnal air temperature range decreased by up to 4 degrees C, reducing CCSM4 biases. These changes were much larger than those resulting from prescribed lake disappearance in some present-day permafrost regions under doubled-CO2 conditions. Correcting the underestimation of lake area in present climate caused widespread high-latitude summer cooling at 850 hPa. Significant remote changes included decreases in the strength of fall Southern Ocean westerlies. We found significantly different winter responses when separately analysing 45-yr subperiods, indicating that relatively long simulations are required to discern the impacts of surface changes on remote conditions. We also investigated the surface forcing of lakes using idealised aqua-planet experiments which showed that surface changes of 2 degrees C in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics could cause substantial changes in precipitation and winds in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere. Shifts in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone were opposite in sign to those predicted by some previous studies.

The objective of this study was to observe and quantify the grazing activities and to estimate the energy expenditure due to locomotion of goats in open range. The study was carried out at 'Finca de Bonaya' privately-owned site, which extends over 1,482 ha, located in the Nevada mountain-range, Almeria. The local altitude varies from 1,100 to 2,000 m above sea level. The area has a mediterranean mountain climate, with annual precipitation ranging from 400 to 700 mm and average daily temperatures from 4.7 degrees C in winter to 23.0 degrees C in slimmer. Landscape is characterised by holm oak wood and pine wood, degradation scrubs and hydrophilic grasses communities. The experimental flock grazed on 3 routes during the whole year. The goats were released to graze during the day and then returned to an enclosed shed. The type of goat management was considered as semi-extensive. Direct observation was used to simulate the total distance walked, the vertical ascent or descent, and to quantify other grazing activities. Data on activities on range and distance travelled were taken on 3 days in each season. The energy expenditure of locomotion was calculated from the horizontal and vertical components of travel and the corresponding costs, which had been previously obtained by calorimetry. There was no significant seasonal effect on period devoted to specific activities on range (P>0.05). However, significant changes in the estimated daily energy expenditure and extra energy expenditure due to locomotion of the animals at pasture were found in different seasons (P<0.05). Grazing and walking were the primary activities of goats throughout the study, accounting for 51.7 and 42.0% of the animals' daily period on range, respectively. Daily travelled distances by goats on range fluctuated from 12,777 m in summer to 8,100 m in autumn, with an annual average of 9,954 m, which represents a mean speed of 20.8 m/min calculated over the whole period on range. The mean annual vertical ascent or descent was 500 m. Estimated heat production due to locomotion ranged from 130.9 to 88.5 kJ/kg(0.75) per day in summer and autumn respectively.

Madagascar is a particularly challenging environment because climatic conditions seem less predictable than in comparative ecosystems in other parts of the world. We used the reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus) from the most unpredictable environment in Madagascar as a model to investigate the flexibility of energy saving strategies to cope with the unpredictability of their habitat. For this we measured T-sk of free-ranging mouse lemurs throughout the year using temperature data loggers. M. griseorufus showed a very strong seasonal as well as an individual flexibility in thermoregulation. During the rainy season all M. griseorufus remained normothermic. At the beginning of the dry season individuals started to exhibit different energy saving strategies: irregular short torpor bouts, regular daily torpor, prolonged torpor of a few days, and hibernation over several weeks. The accumulation of sufficient seasonal body fat was the crucial factor determining the thermal behavior of individuals. The observed intraspecific and sex independent variation in thermoregulatory patterns within one population inhabiting the same small geographical area is exceptional and gives M. griseorufus the ability to respond to current environmental as well as individual conditions. This thermal plasticity might be seen as a key to success and survival for M. griseorufus in an extremely unpredictable environment.",,,,,"Dausmann, Kathrin/E-9270-2017; Ganzhorn, Joerg/AAO-6955-2020","Ganzhorn, Joerg/0000-0003-1395-9758",,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,1432-136X,,,,JAN,2011,181,1,,,,,165,173,,10.1007/s00360-010-0507-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-010-0507-5,,,,,,,,20717683,,,,,WOS:000286341400015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three interpolation methods are used to determine 2-m temperatures from the ERA-Interim data set at the station locations. The differences were analysed utilizing root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and bias. The comparison was conducted for daily, monthly and annual time scales, and for the rainy (May-October) and less rainy (November-April) seasons. The best interpolation method is the mean of four grid points method. We find a warm bias in the ERA-Interim reanalysis for most Cuban stations. The smallest differences are at 1800 UTC and the largest differences are at 1200 UTC. All differences are greater than 0.3 K, although many of the stations show differences in the range of 1.5-2.0 K. In some stations the differences are greater than 5.0 K. At the daily scale more than 50% of the stations show significant differences at the 95% confidence level. The differences are caused by the altitude difference between the stations and the nearest grid point of ERA-Interim, the land-sea mask of ERA-Interim and the station location respect to this mask, and by local processes, such as a local breeze. At the monthly scale there are fewer stations with significant differences than for the other time scales.

Petunia 'Easy Wave Coral Reef' and 'Wave Purple' were grown in glass-glazed greenhouses at 14-23 degrees C Or 14-26 degrees C and under 4-19 mol m(-2) d(-1) with a 16-h photoperiod. The flower developmental rate was predicted using a model that included a linear MDT function with a base temperature multiplied by an exponential MDLI saturation function. The flower developmental rate increased and time to flower decreased as MDT increased within the temperature range studied. For example, under a MDLI of 12 mol m(-2) d(-1), as MDT increased from 14 to 23 degrees C, time to flower of 'Easy Wave Coral Reef' and 'Wave Purple' decreased from 51 to 22d and 62 to 30d, respectively. Flower developmental rate increased as MDLI increased until saturation at 14.1-14.4 mol m(-2) d(-1). Nonlinear models were generated for effects of MDT and MDLI on flower bud number and plant height at flowering. The number of flower buds at flowering increased as MDT decreased and MDLI increased. For example, at an MDT of 14 degrees C with 18 mol m(-2) d(-1), plants had 2.5-2.9 times more flower buds than those grown at 23 degrees C and 4 mol m(-2) d(-1).

Whilst daily and seasonal rhythms are likely to be present, and to represent underlying biological functions, these will normally be modified by several factors in the environment. Important amongst these are light, temperature, humidity and whether or not it is raining. There is also the problem that the factors might interact, the effect of, say, time of day, being modified by the concomitant temperature. Separating out the effects of these different factors experimentally can be extremely arduous, if not impossible. An alternative approach is to treat the environmental factors as covariants, and then to separate out their effects from the biological ones by statistical means, using Analysis of Covariance, ANCOVA. The potential of this method is illustrated in the current report by a consideration of exits and entries of a colony of bees from their hive. Hourly measurements of this behaviour were taken during the daylight hours for three consecutive days in 11 consecutive months of the year. At the same time, ambient temperature, light intensity, humidity and whether or not it was raining were recorded. ANCOVA enabled the effects of temperature, humidity, light and rainfall upon the exits from the hive and entries back into it to be separated from the effects of time of day and time of the year. The analyses allowed those climatic variables, in addition to time-of-day and time-of-year effects, that influenced behaviour to be identified. Such climatic variables have not been previously isolated, and this might have lead to a misinterpretation of similar results in the past. Having separated out any effects of climatic variables (the covariates), the interaction between time of day and time of the year could then be investigated. Furthermore it has been possible to quantify the effects upon behaviour of each covariate. Rainfall was shown to decrease activity by more than 80%. For the other variables (temperature, humidity and light intensity), the statistical model allowed for the possibility that an increase in the variable initially produced a rise in activity but that this was followed, if the variable continued to rise, by a fall in activity. For light intensity, only a very modest increase in activity was found, and this continued throughout the range of intensities measured. However, for both temperature and humidity, the effects were more marked and showed 'turning points'. That is, activity increased as the ambient temperature rose until activity peaked at about 33-35degreesC; after which activity began to fall. Similarly, entries into the hive rose with increasing humidity up to a value of 48%, but fell thereafter. By contrast, exits from the hive increased with increasing humidity throughout the range measured. In the biological system tested, this form of analysis has produced valuable information about the way different factors influence activity in a field study. The results strongly suggest that the proposed methodology has a much wider and more general application. The way in which this type of analysis might be elaborated is discussed.",,,,,"Nevill, Alan/Q-1010-2019","Nevill, Alan/0000-0003-0506-3652",,,,,,,,,,,,,0929-1016,1744-4179,,,,FEB-APR,2004,35,1-2,,,,,159,169,,10.1080/09291010412331313313,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291010412331313313,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000224961500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper examines the thermal dynamics of PCM wallboard that is subjected to the diurnal variation of room temperature, but is not directly illuminated by the sun. The purpose of this work is to provide guidelines useful in selecting an optimal PCM and in estimating the benefits of PCM architectural products. The energy stored during a daily cycle depends upon a) the melt temperature of the PCM; b) the temperature range over which melt occurs; and c) the latent capacity per unit area of wallboard. Situations with the wallboard on an interior partition or on the inside of the building envelope are investigated separately. The following findings are presented. The maximum diurnal energy storage occurs at a value of the PCM melt temperature that is close to the average room temperature in most circumstances. Diurnal energy storage decreases if the phase change transition occurs over a range of temperatures. The diurnal storage achieved in practice may be limited to the range 300-400 kJ/m(2), even if the wallboard has a greater latent capacity. The implications of these findings for test room experiments are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Mean initial weights of 0.22-, 0.73-, 1.56- and 18.9-g fish, previously habituated to a dry diet, were used in experiments lasting between 14 and 30 days, depending on initial body weight. Daily feeding levels ranged from 2% to 20% of biomass in 0.22-g fish, from 1% to 8% in 0.73-g fish, from 1% to 10% of biomass in 1.56-g fish and from 0.3% to 3% of biomass for 18.9-g fish. Feeding levels significantly affected survival of perch, except in experiment 4 with large juveniles (18.9). In experiments 2 and 3 (with 0.73- and 1.56-g fish, respectively), cannibalism was significantly higher at the lowest feeding level (1% biomass day (-1)), while starvation seemed to be the major cause of death in experiment 1 with 0.22-g fish. Values of specific growth rate (SGR) plotted against daily food ration allowed the maintenance, optimum and maximum feeding levels to be determined, according to the Brett and Grove's model. Optimum feeding level for Eurasian perch decreased from 7.4% to 5.1%, 4.5% and 2.2% biomass day (-1) for fish of 0.22, 0.73, 1.56 and 18.9 g initial body weight, respectively.

In this study, we describe I) interactions between soil CO2 concentration, temperature, soil water content and root respiration, and II) the effect of short-term fluctuations of these three environmental factors on the relation between actual and observed root respiration rates. We designed an automated, open gas-exchange system that allows continuous measurements on 12 chambers with intact roots in soil. By using three distinct chamber designs with each a different path for the air flow, we were able to measure root respiration over a 50-fold range of soil CO2 concentrations (400 to 25000 ppm) and to separate the effect of irrigation on observed vs. actual root respiration rate. All respiration measurements were made on one-year-old citrus seedlings in sterilized sandy soil with minimal organic material. Root respiration was strongly affected by diurnal fluctuations in temperature (Q(10) = 2), which agrees well with the literature. In contrast to earlier findings for Douglas-fir (Qi et al., 1994), root respiration rates of citrus were not affected by soil CO2 concentrations (400 to 25000 ppm CO2; pH around 6). Soil CO2 was strongly affected by soil water content but not by respiration measurements, unless the air flow for root respiration measurements was directed through the soil. The latter method of measuring root respiration reduced soil CO2 concentration to that of incoming air. Irrigation caused a temporary reduction in CO2 diffusion, decreasing the observed respiration rates obtained by techniques that depended on diffusion. This apparent drop in respiration rate did not occur if the air flow was directed through the soil. Our dynamic data are used to indicate the optimal method of measuring root respiration in soil, in relation to the objectives and limitations of the experimental conditions.",,,,,"Eissenstat, David/AAE-2793-2020; Bouma, Tjeerd J/A-9841-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0032-079X,,,,,AUG,1997,195,2,,,,,221,232,,10.1023/A:1004278421334,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004278421334,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997YE36400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

A standard glazed flat plate collector and an evacuated tube collector are installed in parallel and tested at the same working conditions; the evacuated collector is a direct flow through type with external compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) reflectors. Efficiency in steady-state and quasi-dynamic conditions is measured following the standard EN 12975-2 and it is compared with the input/output curves measured for the whole day. The first purpose of the present work is the comparison of results in steady-state and quasi-dynamic test methods both for flat plate and evacuated tube collectors. Beside this, the objective is to characterize and to compare the daily energy performance of these two types of collectors. An effective mean for describing and analyzing the daily performance is the so called input/output diagram, in which the collected solar energy is plotted against the daily incident solar radiation. Test runs have been performed in several conditions to reproduce different conventional uses (hot water, space heating, solar cooling). Results are also presented in terms of daily efficiency versus daily average reduced temperature difference: this allows to represent the comparative characteristics of the two collectors when operating under variable conditions, especially with wide range of incidence angles.

In the daytime, moisture increases around the convergence zone in the lee of the mountain were formed by thermally induced local circulations in moderate ambient wind. Then, a region of enhanced precipitable water vapor (PWV) was formed. The region of enhanced PWV was transported to the lee side of the mountain by the ambient wind and finally reached the plain during the night. The convective instability in the lower troposphere and the possibility of deep convection were controlled by the advection of water vapor in the lee of the mountain, especially by the position of the enhanced PWV region. As a result, the diurnal cycle of the convective instability showed a phase difference between the mountainous region and the plain. The profile of equivalent potential temperature tended to be unstable in the lee of the mountain at night and contributed to the production of nighttime precipitation. The propagation speed of the enhanced PWV region was roughly determined by the ambient wind speed. Some sensitivity experiments using bulk microphysics have suggested that the propagation speed of the enhanced PWV region is insensitive to the occurrence of a deep convection. The enhanced PWV region generated over a wider mountain range tends to travel farther, retaining its magnitude even until night. The water vapor transport process presented in this study agrees well with the actual diurnal variations of rainfall observed in many regions over land.",,,,,"Sato, Tomonori/GOP-2277-2022; Sato, Tomonori/A-3415-2012","Sato, Tomonori/0000-0001-6541-742X; Sato, Tomonori/0000-0001-6541-742X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-4928,,,,,AUG,2003,60,16,,,,,1992,2003,,10.1175/1520-0469(2003)060<1992:ATNSOD>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(2003)060<1992:ATNSOD>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000184470300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Compared with conventional rice fields, the rice-duck ecological planting and breeding model significantly decreased the methane emission from paddy fields. Methane emission flux from rice-duck complex ecosystem presented distinct diurnal and seasonal variations. The diurnal variation in methane emission flux was basically consistent with daily temperature change, and methane emission flux reached a peak from 12 noon to 2 p.m. But the seasonal variation patterns of methane emission flux were not completely consistent between early rice and late rice. The peak of methane emission flux for early rice and late rice, respectively, appeared in the young panicle differentiation stage and the full tillering stage. Moreover, the seasonal fluctuation range of methane emission flux from early rice was smaller than that from late rice, and the total amount of methane emission from late rice also significantly higher than that from early rice.

J,"Bin, W",,,,"Wen, Bin",,,Effects of High Temperature and Water Stress on Seed Germination of the Invasive Species Mexican Sunflower,PLOS ONE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mexican sunflower is native to Mexico and Central America and was introduced into China early last century. Now it has widely naturalized and is exhibiting increasing invasiveness in South China. As this species often dominates bare ground, a habitat characterized by extreme fluctuation in temperature and water, it is reasonable to hypothesize that it has special adaptations to high temperature and water stress. Using laboratory experiments to simulate these stresses, this study investigated the response of Mexican sunflower seed germination to temperature and water stress, and compared these responses with those previously reported for another invasive, bamboo piper, which is confined to relatively cool and moist habitats in Xishuangbanna. As expected, Mexican sunflower seeds exhibited higher tolerance to these stresses than bamboo piper. Germination of Mexican sunflower seeds was highest at 15-30 degrees C, but significant numbers of seeds germinated and formed seedlings at 10 degrees C and 35 degrees C, at which no bamboo piper seeds formed seedlings, indicating a wider temperature range for germination than the latter. Roughly half the seeds survived 240 h continuous heat treatment and up to 15 h daily periodical heat treatment at 40 degrees C, while bamboo piper seeds were mostly killed by these treatments. About 20% of Mexican sunflower but no bamboo piper seeds germinated after heat treatment for 30 min at 80 degrees C. Germination was completely inhibited in bamboo piper seeds at -0.6 mPa, while 20-60% of Mexican sunflower seeds germinated depending on PEG or NaCl as osmoticum. This higher tolerance in Mexican sunflower seeds accords with its stronger invasiveness in this area. This comparison between two plant invaders demonstrates that invasiveness is not an all-or-nothing situation, and that adaptation to local habitats is a critical determinant of successful invasiveness for an alien plant.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,OCT 28,2015,10,10,,,,,,,e0141567,10.1371/journal.pone.0141567,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0141567,,,,,,,,26509675,,,,,WOS:000363918100104,View Full Record in Web of Science

Glass-phase American eels Anguilla rostrata (Lesueur), which had been captured near the mouth of an estuary in Maine, USA, prior to freshwater exposure, deposited increments at a daily rate at ambient temperature and salinity in a field and laboratory study. The regression for glass eels not possessing a transition ring was: I = 0.976(D - 1) + 0.434, where I is the number of otolith increments distal to a fluorescent mark placed on the otolith at the beginning of the experiment, and D is the number of days in the experiment, which ranged from 7 to 49. The slope was not significantly different than 1. Unexpectedly, many glass eels deposited the transition ring during the experiment, although this ring had previously been thought to mark entry into fresh water. The regression for these glass eels was: I = 0.961(D - 1) - 3.880, and the slope was not significantly different than 1. The negative intercept suggests that approximately il days were lost from the otolith record during deposition of the ring. This study demonstrated daily deposition of increments prior to freshwater exposure and demonstrated that deposition of the transition ring is not linked to freshwater entry.

Total annual CO2 emission from NT was stable, being the same along the three cycles, while total RT CO2 emission decreased from the first to the third cycle. The TOC content was almost stable, while WEOC showed large variability that could explain the variability of CO2 emissions for RT over short time scales and was probably because of weed control in the middle of the second growing cycle.

The November 1984 and April 1987 periods coincided with the TROPIC HEAT and TROPIC HEAT-2 experiments, during which direct measurements of turbulent dissipation rates were made near the mooring site. In May-June 1987, a special set of moored time series were collected between 30-m and 61-m depth with 1-minute temporal resolution in addition to standard measurements at 15-minute resolution. The high-resolution data indicated the existence of a diurnal cycle in variance that was most pronounced at frequencies of 10-30 cph and that was coherent over the 3 1 -m extent of the vertical array. It is likely that this diurnal cycle in variance was due in part to internal waves remotely generated at the base of the nighttime mixed layer and that the appearance of internal waves in the thermocline at frequencies higher than the local Vaisala frequency (about 2-7 cph) in May-June 1987 was due to Doppler shifting by the Equatorial Undercurrent. It is also likely that part of the observed diurnal cycle in variance was due to local shear instabilities in the Equatorial Undercurrent that may have been triggered by the diurnally modulated internal wave field. More coarsely resolved 15-minute moored time-series data from November 1984, April 1987, and May-June 1987 indicated the presence of a diurnal cycle after averaging over at least 30 days of data. Largest diurnal ranges in temperature and vertical displacement variance were typically observed in November 1984 when wind speed, zonal wind stress, and mean vertical shear were largest and when the mean gradient Richardson number was smallest. The diurnal cycle in turbulent dissipation rate had a larger amplitude in November 1984 than in April 1987, consistent with a dynamical connection between internal wave variability and turbulence in the equatorial thermocline.",,,,,"McPhaden, Michael J/D-9799-2016","McPhaden, Michael J/0000-0002-8423-5805",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-3670,,,,,NOV,1992,22,11,,,,,1317,1329,,10.1175/1520-0485(1992)022<1317:DCOIWV>2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0485(1992)022<1317:DCOIWV>2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1992JZ29700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using a common-garden experimental protocol, we investigated how bidirectional temperature change can affect survival and growth of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and whether the survival and growth responses differ between two populations, using four thermal-variability treatments (mean: 10 degrees C; range: 7-13 degrees C): (i) constancy; (ii) cyclical fluctuations every two days; (iii) low stochasticity (random changes every 2 days); (iv) high stochasticity (random changes daily). Recently hatched individuals were monitored under thermal variability (6 weeks) and a subsequent one-month period of thermal constancy. We found that variability can positively influence survival, relative to thermal constancy, but negatively affect growth. The observations reported here can be interpreted within the context of Jensen's Inequality (performance at average conditions is unequal to average performance across a range of conditions). Projections of future population viability in the context of climate change would be strengthened by increased experimental attention to the fitness consequences of stochastic and non-stochastic thermal variability.",,,,,"Hutchings, Jeffrey/ABA-1098-2020","Kuparinen, Anna/0000-0002-7807-8946; Hutchings, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1572-5429",,,,,,,,,,,,,0306-4565,1879-0992,,,,AUG,2019,84,,,,,,221,227,,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.012,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.012,,,,,,,,31466757,,,,,WOS:000486107400026,View Full Record in Web of Science

This experiment aims to global gradual deforestation and has two phases. The first phase, defined as the pre-industrial period (1850-1899) with constant unchangeable anthropogenic impact. For this period deforestation modelled with further replacement with grass cover with a linear trend 400000 km(2)/yr or 20 million km2 per 50 years in general. The second phase is next 30 years with no significant changes in forest cover (1900-1929). For conducting this research the data of several global climate models were applied. The results of analysis have demonstrated that a partial deforestation with grass substitution influences the surface reflectivity or albedo and redistribution of shortwave radiative fluxes. In turn, it provokes changes in thermal regime. It was found that the most significant changes in surface reflectivity and the strongest correlation coefficients between albedo and deforestation are in the winter season due to the presence of snow cover. As a result, statistical significant increase of albedo is with maximum values up to 24 %/50 years in some grids in winter. Then in the summer season maximal changes are up to 2.7 %/50 years due to small differences between forest and grass albedos. As a consequence, changes in albedo cause changes in surface and air temperature regimes. Strong dependencies were found in winter between changes in albedo and temperatures with maximum temperature decrease -2.5...-2.0 %/50 years. In warm season correlations are weaker in comparison to cold season, but nevertheless, temperatures decrease also take place with maximum values -2.0.-1.5 %/50 years. The analysis between deforestation and daily air temperature range has shown that particularly in winter season there is an increase of 0.5...1.5 %/50 years, whereas such tendency is not observed in warm season. Calculations of year air temperature range demonstrated controversial results among climate models, as follows it is hard to make a conclusion about the contribution of forest cover reduction to changes in this index. It was revealed, that global climate models with higher resolution are more sensitive to changes in albedo and, as a consequence to other characteristics than models with coarse ones. It should be noticed that obtained results concern pre-industrial period with minimal anthropogenic impact, when observed a stable snow cover in winter in Ukraine. In the current climate change with significant warming and reduction of snow season duration deforestation can have opposite effects on radiative and thermal regimes that require further studying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0203-3100,2524-1052,,,,,2021,43,3,,,,,135,160,,10.24028/gzh.v43i3.236385,http://dx.doi.org/10.24028/gzh.v43i3.236385,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000670656300008,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present research, three discrete equations for temperature in the NMRF boundary layer scheme are applied, namely the original (hereafter NMRF), the adjustment (hereafter NMRF-gocp), and the one in the YSU boundary-layer scheme (hereafter NMRF-TZ). The results show that the deviations of height, temperature, U and V wind in the boundary layer in the NMRF-gocp and NMRF-TZ experiments are smaller than those in the NMRF experiment and the deviations in the NMRF-gocp experiment are the smallest. The deviations of humidity are complex for the different forecasting lead time in the three experiments. Moreover, there are obvious diurnal variations of deviations from these variables, where the diurnal variations of deviations from height and temperature are similar and those from U and V wind are also similar. However, the diurnal variation of humidity is relatively complicated. The root means square errors of 2m temperature (T2m) and 10m speed (V10m) from the three experiments show that the error of NMRF-gocp is the smallest and that of NMRF is the biggest. There is also a diurnal variation of T2m and V10m, where T2m has double peaks and V10m has only one peak. Comparison of the discrete equations between NMRF and NMRF-gocp experiments shows that the deviation of temperature is likely to be caused by the calculation of vertical eddy diffusive coefficients of heating, which also leads to the deviations of other elements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1006-8775,,,,,MAR,2022,28,1,,,,,12,28,,10.46267/j.1006-8775.2022.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.46267/j.1006-8775.2022.002,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000768871800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two experiments were performed in a T-maze with single feeders in the arms, one empty and the other with a food reward. In each of the experiments, we used 10 naive fish, which were placed in the T-maze individually once a day. The fish were fed between sessions to avoid increasing differences in hunger levels and, in turn, increasing the differences in motivation to find the food between the temperature treatments. The results revealed that the learning rate was greater at the higher temperature, which was apparent in a greater percentage reduction in the time and distance travelled needed to locate the daily food reward between successive sessions at the higher temperature than at the lower temperature. The results show there was a significant effect of temperature on the daily rate of change in the number of fish choosing the correct arm, distance travelled and time needed to locate the daily food reward, which may be attributed to the positive effect of temperature on learning rate, and may indicate the importance of temperature for the cognitive testing of zebrafish.",,,,,"Maszczyk, Piotr/AAN-4661-2020","Maszczyk, Piotr/0000-0002-1738-419X; Babkiewicz, Ewa/0000-0003-2398-8448; Gliwicz, Zbigniew Maciej/0000-0002-6628-4785",,,,,,,,,,,,,0179-1613,1439-0310,,,,AUG,2021,127,8,,,,,632,642,,10.1111/eth.13197,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.13197,,JUN 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659437700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One lemur hibernated and remained inactive for 4 weeks. During this time, body temperature followed the ambient temperature passively with a minimum body temperature of 11.5A degrees C, interrupted by irregular arousals to normothermic levels. Under the same conditions, the second individual displayed only short bouts of torpor in the early morning hours but maintained stable normothermic body temperatures throughout its nocturnal activity. Reduction of body temperature was less pronounced in the mouse lemur that utilized short bouts of torpor with a minimum value of 27A degrees C.

The data obtained from germination studies on a temperature gradient plate were used to populate models to predict optimum germination responses ( mean time to germination, germination timing and success) under current (1950-2000 averages) and future (2070 high greenhouse gas emission) temperature scenarios. The species exhibited a mix of germination responses, often with high tolerance to high diurnal temperatures. A number of species did not reach their full potential within the experimental period, indicating the presence of dormancy not overcome due to temperature alone. Modelling revealed that for some species the opportunity for germination may decline due to rising temperatures, but for others there would be little change, though a shift in germination timing may be expected. This approach to identifying extinction risk contributes tangibly to efforts to predict plant responses to environmental change and can help prioritize species for management actions, direct limited resources towards further investigations and supplement bioclimatic modelling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1211-9520,1874-9348,,,,JUN,2019,54,1-2,,,,,29,42,,10.1007/s12224-019-09335-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12224-019-09335-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000510731000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The difference between day and night temperature (DIF - defined as day temperature minus night temperature) influences plant morphology in a wide range of species. In this study, the effect of photoperiod and DIF on stem elongation and growth of dill plants was investigated. The first experiment included a comparison of different temperatures between day and night (DIF-5 - 20/25 degrees C, DIF0 -20 degrees C and 25 degrees C, DIF+5 -25/20 degrees C) for a 16-h photoperiod. The second experiment comprised the photoperiod of 16 and 24 hours for two constant temperatures -20 and 25 degrees C. Significant differences between DIF+5 and DIF-5 were observed in the case of plant height. Elongation growth was enhanced by positive DIF and was inhibited by negative DIF, although the strongest stem elongation inhibition was recorded at the temperature of 25 degrees C and a 16-h photoperiod. Leaf area was greatly affected by the temperature and DIF, but only slightly influenced by the photoperiod. Leaf area in DIF-5 was smaller than that in DIF+5 or 0 (20 degrees C). The highest essential oil content in the herbage was recorded for a constant temperature of 25 degrees C as well as 20 degrees C and a 24-hour photoperiod.",,,,,,"Fraszczak, Barbara/0000-0001-7931-6451",,,,,,,,,,,,,1644-0692,,,,,,2012,11,2,,,,,217,228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000306280900019,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this species the incidence of diapause decreased within the range from 25 to 33 degrees C. The long day prevented diapause only within particular temperature limits, which were species specific. In species with typical long-day photoperiodic response (C. perla, C. septempunctata and Chrysoperla carnea) daily temperature fluctuations were less favourable to diapause induction than constant mean temperature. In C. phyllochroma and C. abbreviata the similar high incidence of diapausing prepupae was induced both by daily natural thermoperiods and constant mean temperature. In experiments carried out under 12-h thermophase: 12-h cryophase conditions it was revealed that photo-thermoperiodic responses of C. phyllochroma were significantly dependent on cryophase temperature, whereas diapause of C. perla was determined mainly by photoperiod.

We evaluated the germination characteristics of freshly collected seeds from 13 species of the genus Vellozia (Velloziaceae) that show different degrees of endemism, collected at various locations in the Espinhaco Mountain Range in Minas Gerais State, south-eastern Brazil. The size and mass of the seeds, as well as the influence of light and temperature on their germination, were measured. Experiments were performed in germination chambers under constant temperatures of 10-40 degrees C (intervals of 5 degrees C), with a 12-h photoperiod, as well as in continuous darkness. All species studied had small seeds with mass varying from 0.06 to 1.21 mg. Most species required light for germination, displaying high germinability in the range of 15-40 degrees C; some species, however, germinated in the absence of light at the highest temperatures (35 and 40 degrees C). The sizes and masses of the seeds showed significant linear correlations, but light sensitivity was not related to these seed characteristics. The responses observed suggest that light requirement for germination, associated with the small sizes of Vellozia spp. seeds, contribute to the formation of persistent seed banks. The observed tolerance of these seeds to a wide range of germination temperatures is consistent with the large daily temperature fluctuations experienced in campos rupestres sites, although these seed characteristics cannot by themselves explain the high degree of endemism or the restricted distributions observed among the species examined.",,,,,"Garcia, Queila S/B-5429-2014","Garcia, Queila S/0000-0002-7137-788X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0960-2585,1475-2735,,,,MAR,2013,23,1,,,,,67,74,,10.1017/S0960258512000256,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0960258512000256,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000314426100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

METHODS: An experimental argon fluoride excimer laser with a repetition rate of 1050 Hz, a radiant exposure of 500 mJ/cm(2), and single pulse energy of 2.1 mJ was used for photoablation of PMMA plates. The initial plate temperature varied from 10.1 degrees C to 75.7 degrees C. The initial temperature was measured with an infrared camera and the central ablation depth of a myopic ablation of -9.00 diopters (D) with an optical zone of 6.5 mm was measured by means of a surface profiling system. RESULTS: The ablation depth increased linearly from 73.9 to 96.3 mu m within a temperature increase from 10.1 degrees C to 75.7 degrees C (increase rate of 0.3192 mu m/K). The linear correlation was found to be significant (P<.05) with a coefficient of determination of R-2=0.95. Based on these results and assuming a standard room temperature of 20 degrees C, optimal plate temperature was calculated to be 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C to maintain an ablation within 0.25 D. CONCLUSIONS: The temperature of PMMA plates for clinical laser calibration should be controlled ideally within a range of approximately +/- 5 degrees C, to avoid visually significant refractive error due to calibration error. Further experimental investigations are required to determine the influence of different initial corneal temperatures on the refractive outcome.

We compared effects of elevated CO2 with those of daytime warming on acclimation of snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) to freezing temperatures under field conditions. Reduction in stomatal conductance g(c) under elevated CO2 was shown to cause leaf temperature to increase by up to 3 degrees C. In this study, this increase in leaf temperature was simulated under ambient CO2 conditions by using a free air temperature increase (FATI) system to warm snow gum leaves during daytime, thereby increasing the diurnal range in temperature without affecting temperature minima. Acclimation to freezing temperatures was assessed using measures of electrolyte leakage and photosynthetic efficiency of leaf discs exposed to different nadir temperatures. Here, we show that both elevated CO2 and daytime warming delayed acclimation to freezing temperatures for 2-3 weeks after which time freeze tolerance of the treated plants in both the FATI and open top chamber (OTC) experiments did not differ from control plants. Our results support the hypothesis that delayed development of freezing tolerance under elevated CO2 is because of higher daytime leaf temperatures under elevated CO2.

High heating costs have motivated growers to improve the efficiency of crop production to minimize energy inputs. We performed greenhouse experiments with Petunia xhybrida 'Dreams Neon Rose' and Tagetes patula 'Janie Flame' to understand how mean daily temperature (MDT) and photosynthetic daily light integral (DLI) influence plant development. This information was then used to determine how the production environment and crop timing influence greenhouse energy consumption for heating on a per-crop basis. Seedlings of each species were grown in an environmental growth chamber at an MDT of 20.4 degrees C with a DLI of 10 mol m(-2) d(-1) and under a 16-h photoperiod. After 19 to 32 d from seed sow, seedlings were transplanted into 10-cm pots and grown in glass-glazed greenhouses at constant air temperature set points of 14, 17, 20, 23, or 26 degrees C and under a 16-h photoperiod provided by high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps. At each temperature, plants were grown under two DLI treatments provided by the use of a shade curtain and different intensities of supplemental lighting from HPS lamps. Time to flower in Petunia decreased from 43 to 17 d as MDT and DLI increased from 14 degrees C and 4 mol m(-2) d(-1) to 26 degrees C and 16 mol.m(-2) d(-1). In Tagetes, time to flower ranged from 17 to 38 d. A decision-support software (Virtual Grower) was used to estimate energy consumption at different locations in the United States based on the predicted crop production durations at different MDTs and DLIs. For example, the predicted energy cost for greenhouse heating to produce a Petunia crop in Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA for a 1 April finish date was 8% lower when grown at an MDT of 20 degrees C compared to that at 14 degrees C.

In this study, we identify that soil temperature in May over the key region of Central Asia (42 degrees N-50 degrees N, 62 degrees E-80 degrees E, KRCA) from Noah, Mosaic, CLM and ERA-interim datasets is closely linked to variations of the surface air temperature, daily maximum temperature and hot days over Northeastern China in summer (June-July-August), with correlation coefficients of regional average detrended time series ranging from 0.42 to 0.54, and all significant at the 99% confidence level for the period of 1979-2018. The possible physical mechanism behind the substantial downstream impacts of soil temperature over Central Asia are explored via diagnostical analysis combined with regional climate model experiments. Warmer soil temperature in May over the KRCA can keep to the summer and cause positive anomalies of geopotential height in summer over Northeastern China through the Rossby wave propagation, and associated stronger subsidence warming, less cloud cover, more solar radiation reaching the surface, higher planetary boundary layer, and stronger thermal advection at 850 hPa, which provide favorable conditions for warmer surface air temperature particularly in the daytime as well as more hot days. This study further reveals that soil temperature over Central Asia in May makes important contribution to prediction of summer surface air temperature, daily maximum temperature and hot days over Northeastern China in terms of regional average time series and spatial patterns. Our findings highlight the previously-unknown substantial role of antecedent soil temperature condition over Central Asia for summer surface air temperature variation and prediction over Northeastern China.",,,,,"Liu, Ye/AAG-7271-2020","Liu, Ye/0000-0001-5131-8412; Zhang, Jingyong/0000-0003-1056-8436",,,,,,,,,,,,,0930-7575,1432-0894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s00382-022-06360-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06360-8,,JUN 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000810324900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The willow beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis is ideal for such studies. It lives in California's Sierra Nevada on the southern edge of its worldwide range. Beetles experience elevated air temperatures during summertime egg laying and larval development. Exposure to these temperatures causes physiological stress, which may reduce reproductive success and endanger populations. The glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is a marker of temperature adaptation in C. aeneicollis. PGI allele frequency varies across a latitudinal gradient: allele 1 is common in Rock Creek (RC), which is cooler and to the north, and allele 4 is common in Big Pine Creek (BPC), which is warmer and to the south. In populations that are intermediate in geography and climate (e. g., Bishop Creek [BC]), PGI-4 frequency increases from north to south such that alleles 1 and 4 are in relatively equal frequency in southern BC. Over the past decade, Sierra Nevada beetle populations have colonized high elevations and have become extinct at lower elevations where they were once common. In BC, the magnitude of PGI allele frequency fluctuations among life-history stages is related to maximal air temperature, with the frequency of PGI-4 increasing after the hottest part of summer. To identify mechanisms that may cause shifts in PGI allele frequency, we measured metabolic rate and fecundity for beetles collected at BC. Metabolic rate of males and females was measured at 20 degrees and 36 degrees C using flow-through respirometry. To measure laboratory fecundity, mating pairs were acclimated for 4 h each afternoon at a control temperature (20 degrees C) or at mildly elevated temperatures (26 degrees or 32 degrees C) and number of eggs laid was counted daily for 24 d, after which tissue levels of 70-kD heat shock proteins (Hsp70) were determined. Previous studies had demonstrated differences in Hsp70 expression among PGI genotypes at these temperatures. To measure field fecundity, mating pairs from BC were transplanted to similar elevations in BPC, BC, and RC and were monitored in situ for 24 d. Metabolic rate was higher for PGI 4-4 genotypes than for PGI 1-4 or PGI 1-1 individuals at 36 degrees C but not at 20 degrees C. In contrast, laboratory fecundity was greatest for females possessing PGI-1, independent of acclimation temperature. At the end of the laboratory fecundity experiment, Hsp70 expression was positively related to fecundity, suggesting minimal reproductive cost of upregulation of heat shock proteins in response to mild heat stress. In the field, fecundity was highest for PGI 1-1 and PGI 1-4 individuals in RC and PGI 4-4 individuals in BPC and was similar for all genotypes in BC. Thus, fecundity in nature was greatest for the genotypes that were most common in each area. Taken together, data reported here suggest that hot, dry summers in the Sierra Nevada may result in an increase in frequency of the PGI-4 allele and shifts to higher elevations for C. aeneicollis populations.",,,,,"Dahlhoff, Elizabeth/AAI-1636-2020; Gibbs, Allen G/G-6939-2014; Gibbs, Allen/D-6968-2011","Dahlhoff, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7019-5005; Gibbs, Allen G/0000-0001-5233-2056; Rank, Nathan/0000-0001-8383-1501; Deiner, Kristy/0000-0001-9755-3223",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,,,,,NOV-DEC,2008,81,6,,,,,718,732,,10.1086/590165,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/590165,,,,,,,,18956974,,,,,WOS:000260547400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The addition of canopy gaps has been suggested as a management tool to accelerate development of riparian forest complexity, create stream light conditions that mimic those in late successional forests, and enhance in-stream productivity. Although gaps form naturally in late-successional forests, explicitly adding gaps is a concern because the increases in light that accompany a canopy gap may have the potential to increases stream temperature, which is an important ecological driver and regulatory metric in streams. The goal of this study was to determine whether and to what degree riparian forest canopy gaps that reflect localized disturbance events (mortality of one to a few dominant canopy trees) affect stream temperatures. We created experimental gaps in young regenerating riparian forests along six replicate headwater streams in western Oregon. Gaps increased light along 90 m study reaches by 3.91 (+/- 1.63) moles of photons m(-2) day(-1), similar to that of a naturally occurring gap in a late-successional forest. Using a Before-After-Control-Impact study design, we assessed stream temperature by tracking multiple responses in each reach including: maximum seven day moving average of daily maximums (T-7DayMax), maximum seven day moving average of daily means (T-7DayMean), daily maximum, and mean summer temperatures, as well as within-reach (every 30 m) responses, and downstream recovery. Over a 40-day period in summer (July 22nd August 30th), the mean response in T-7DayMax across the six replicate streams was 0.21 degrees C +/- 0.12, and the mean response in T-7DayMean was 0.15 degrees C +/- 0.14. Although the mean response in T-7DayMax (a key regulatory metric) was small, changes varied across individual study streams, and the magnitude of the relative increase in stream T-7DayMax as a result of the canopy gap was strongly negatively correlated with stream size. T-7DayMax was not correlated with the size of the canopy opening or change in reach-scale light availability (within the range of gap sizes from 514 m(2) to 1,374 m(2) (0.05 to 0.14 ha)). Overall, riparian forest canopy gaps have the potential to increase stream temperatures, but in the western Cascade Mountain headwaters studied here, gap effects were small (all < 0.5 degrees C), and temperature responses declined as stream size increased.",,,,,,"Warren, Dana/0000-0001-5282-7972",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1127,1872-7042,,,,OCT 15,2020,474,,,,,,,,118354,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118354,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118354,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000578989200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The early part of sporogony is most sensitive and is affected by high temperatures and temperature fluctuation immediately following ingestion of an infectious blood meal. The aim of this study was to explore whether environmental variables such as temperature, together with the presence of the kdr insecticide resistance mutations, have an impact on survival probability and infection rates in wild Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) exposed and unexposed to a pyrethroid insecticide. Methods:Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) were collected as larvae, reared to adults, and fed on blood samples from 42 Plasmodium falciparum-infected local patients at a health facility in mid-western Uganda, then exposed either to nets treated with sub-lethal doses of deltamethrin or to untreated nets. After seven days, surviving mosquitoes were dissected and their midguts examined for oocysts. Prevalence (proportion infected) and intensity of infection (number of oocysts per infected mosquito) were recorded for each group. Mosquito mortality was recorded daily. Temperature and humidity were recorded every 30 minutes throughout the experiments. Results: Our findings indicate that apart from the effect of deltamethrin exposure, mean daily temperature during the incubation period, temperature range during the first 24 hours and on day 4 post-infectious feed had a highly significant effect on the risk of infection. Deltamethrin exposure still significantly impaired survival of kdr homozygous mosquitoes, while mean daily temperature and relative humidity during the incubation period independently affected mosquito mortality. Significant differences in survival of resistant genotypes were detected, with the lowest survival recorded in mosquitoes with heterozygote L1014S/L1014F genotype. Conclusions: This study confirmed that the early part of sporogony is most affected by temperature fluctuations, while environmental factors affect mosquito survival. The impact of insecticide resistance on malaria infection and vector survival needs to be assessed separately for mosquitoes with different resistance mechanisms to fully understand its implications for currently available vector control tools and malaria transmission.",,,,,"Abeku, Tarekegn/AAV-3731-2020","Abeku, Tarekegn/0000-0002-3673-8635",,,,,,,,,,,,,1756-3305,,,,,OCT 26,2018,11,,,,,,,,560,10.1186/s13071-018-3150-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-3150-8,,,,,,,,30367663,,,,,WOS:000448407900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Meanwhile, the decaying averaging method (DAM) is conducted in parallel for comparison. These postprocessing methods are found to effectively calibrate the temperature forecasts on the basis of the raw ECMWF output. Generally, the SPPM is slightly inferior to the DAM, while its insufficiency decreases with increasing lead times. The NPPM shows manifest superiority for all lead times, with the mean absolute errors of Tmax and Tmin decreased by similar to 0.7 degrees and similar to 0.9 degrees C, respectively. Advantages of the two pattern projection methods are both mainly concentrated on the high-altitude areas such as the Tibetan Plateau, where the raw ECMWF forecasts show the most conspicuous biases. In addition, aiming at further assessments of these methods on extreme event forecasts, two case experiments are carried out toward a heat wave and a cold surge, respectively.

In general, the statistical pattern projection methods are capable of effectively eliminating spatial biases in forecasts of surface air temperature.

It is characterized by a pronounced seasonality with high fluctuations in ambient temperature, low availability of food, and a lack of water during the cool dry season and, additionally, by changes in environmental conditions between years. One of the few mammalian species that manages to inhabit this challenging habitat is the reddish-gray mouse lemur (Microcebus griseorufus). The aim of our study was to determine whether this small primate uses continuous hibernation as an energy saving strategy, and if so, to characterize its physiological properties. We measured skin temperature of 16 free-ranging individuals continuously over 3 months during the cool dry season using collar temperature data loggers. Prolonged hibernation was found in three mouse lemurs and was not sex dependent (one male, two females). Skin temperature of hibernating individuals tracked ambient temperature passively with a minimum skin temperature of 6.5A degrees C and fluctuated strongly each day (up to 20A degrees C), depending on the insulation capacity of the hibernacula. Individuals remained in continuous hibernation even at an ambient temperature of 37A degrees C. The animals hibernated continuously during the dry season, and hibernation bouts were only interrupted by short spontaneous arousals. The study emphasizes that hibernation is an important measure to counter environmental challenge for more tropical species than previously thought, including primates. It furthermore provides evidence that tropical hibernation is functionally similar among tropical species.",,,,,"Dausmann, Kathrin/E-9270-2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-1042,,,,,OCT,2009,96,10,,,,,1221,1227,,10.1007/s00114-009-0580-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0580-3,,,,,,,,19618156,,,,,WOS:000269914200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The models were initialized and compared with observations collected in marine stratocumulus in July 1987 during the First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Regional Experiment. The results of the six LES models are found to be in a fair agreement with the observations. They all capture the distinct diurnal variation in the cloud liquid-water path, the turbulence profiles and clearly show a decoupled boundary layer during daytime and a vertically well-mixed boundary layer during the night. Entrainment of relatively dry and warm air from just above the inversion into the boundary layer is the major process modifying the thermodynamic structure of the boundary layer during the night. The differences that arise in the liquid-water path evolution can therefore be attributed mainly to differences in the entrainment rate. The mean entrainment rates computed from the LES model results are 0.58 +/- 0.08 cm s(-1) and 0.36 +/- 0.03 cm s(-1) for the night-time and daytime periods, respectively. If the horizontal domain size in a LES model is enlarged, mesoscale fluctuations develop. This leads to a broader liquid-water path distribution and a reduction of the cloud albedo. To assess the quality of the representation of stratocumulus in general-circulation models, results from ten SCMs are compared with observations and LES results. The SCM latent and sensible heat fluxes at the surface agree fairly well with the LES results. Many of the SCMs predict a liquid-water path which is much too low, a cloud cover smaller than unity, and cloud tops that are lower than the observations and the LES results. This results in a much larger amount of downwelling short-wave radiation absorbed at the sea surface. Improvement of entrainment parametrizations is needed for a better representation of stratocumulus in SCMs. Observations and LES results of entrainment rates for different stratocumulus cases are compared. The observed entrainment rates in Atlantic stratocumulus clouds during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) are larger than for the ones over the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. Results from LES models corroborate these findings. The differences in the entrainment rate can likely be attributed to the smaller inversion jumps of the liquid-water potential temperature for the ASTEX stratocumulus cases.",,,,,"Cuxart, Joan/F-8921-2019; Lewellen, David/B-1453-2008; de Roode, Stephan R/J-8611-2012; Sanchez, Enrique/L-5086-2014; Cuxart, Joan/AAE-7697-2019","Cuxart, Joan/0000-0002-6217-8045; de Roode, Stephan R/0000-0003-3217-8009; Sanchez, Enrique/0000-0002-7720-4437; Cuxart, Joan/0000-0002-6217-8045; lenderink, geert/0000-0002-1572-4867; van Zanten, Margreet/0000-0003-0010-7839",,,,,,,,,,,,,0035-9009,1477-870X,,,,OCT,2004,130,604,C,,,,3269,3296,,10.1256/qj.03.139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1256/qj.03.139,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000226878300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The frequency distribution of distance moved was dispersed and near-exponential in distribution, a reflection of the wide range in lobster size and moult state. Activity of spiny lobsters during April-July appeared related to mating. Most premoult females were active at night and moved shelters between consecutive days enabling choice of shelters or mates. Mature males either stayed within their shelter and mated with cohabiting females or moved among shelters by day and night in search of receptive females.

We assessed seed germination thermal requirements of three subspecies of M. acuminata using nine seed accessions which had been stored in the Millennium Seed Bank. Diurnally alternating temperature cycles were almost completely essential for germination compared with constant temperatures. Germination was optimal when the upper temperature of a diurnal cycle was at 35 degrees C; the lower temperature of the cycle was less important. Subspecies occurrence coordinates were used to extract climate temperature data which were then compared against the temperature requirements for germination from our experiment results. Maximum temperatures of the warmest month across subspecies ranges were close to but below optimal germination temperatures, as were diurnal ranges, suggesting soil-warming at the micro-climate level following gap creation is important for M. acuminata seed germination. Additionally, pre-treatment for 3 months at 60% relative humidity at constant 25 degrees C improved germination from 14 +/- 10 (mean, standard deviation) to 41 +/- 29% suggesting a period in the soil seed bank under the canopy may increase sensitivity to alternating temperature cycles.

Many organisms are experiencing changing daily light regimes due to latitudinal range shifts driven by climate change and increased artificial light at night (ALAN). Activity patterns are often driven by light cycles, which will have important consequences for species interactions. 2. We tested whether longer photoperiods lead to higher parasitism rates by a day-active parasitoid on its host using a laboratory experiment in which we independently varied daylength and the presence of ALAN. We then tested whether reduced nighttime temperature tempers the effect of ALAN. 3. We found that parasitism rate increased with daylength, with ALAN intensifying this effect only when the temperature was not reduced at night. The impact of ALAN was more pronounced under short daylength. Increased parasitoid activity was not compensated for by reduced life span, indicating that increased daylength leads to an increase in total parasitism effects on fitness. 4. To test the significance of increased parasitism rate for population dynamics, we developed a host-parasitoid model. The results of the model predicted an increase in time-to-equilibrium with increased daylength and, crucially, a threshold daylength above which interactions are unstable, leading to local extinctions. 5. Here we demonstrate that ALAN impact interacts with daylength and temperature by changing the interaction strength between a common day-active consumer species and its host in a predictable way. Our results further suggest that range expansion or ALAN-induced changes in light regimes experienced by insects and their natural enemies will result in unstable dynamics beyond key tipping points in daylength.",,,,,"; Sanders, Dirk/B-4128-2013","Silk, Matthew/0000-0002-8318-5383; Sanders, Dirk/0000-0003-2383-8693; Gaston, Kevin J./0000-0002-7235-7928; Bridle, Jonathan/0000-0002-5999-0307; van Veen, Frank/0000-0003-0708-5492",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2020,89,11,,,,,2508,2516,,10.1111/1365-2656.13328,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13328,,SEP 2020,,,,,,32858779,,,,,WOS:000570234200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, cross-study comparisons are impeded by the paucity of detailed analyses of how passive warming and other manipulations affect microclimate. Here we document the independent and combined effects of a common passive warming manipulation, open-top chambers (OTCs), and a simulated widespread land use, clipping, on microclimate on the Tibetan Plateau. OTCs consistently elevated growing season averaged mean daily air temperature by 1.0-2.0 degrees C, maximum daily air temperature by 2.1-7.3 degrees C and the diurnal air temperature range by 1.9-6.5 degrees C, with mixed effects on minimum daily air temperature, and mean daily soil temperature and moisture. These OTC effects on microclimate differ from reported effects of a common active warming method, infrared heating, which has more consistent effects on soil than on air temperature. There were significant interannual and intragrowing season differences in OTC effects on microclimate. For example, while OTCs had mixed effects on growing season averaged soil temperatures, OTCs consistently elevated soil temperature by approximately 1.0 degrees C early in the growing season. Nonadditive interactions between OTCs and clipping were also present: OTCs in clipped plots generally elevated air and soil temperatures more than OTCs in nonclipped plots. Moreover, site factors dynamically interacted with microclimate and with the efficacy of the OTC manipulations. These findings highlight the need to understand differential microclimate effects between warming methods, within warming method across ecosystem sites, within warming method crossed with other treatments, and within sites over various timescales.

The capability of ANN models to simulate the variation of temperature in soils was investigated by considering readily available meteorologic parameters. The ANN model was constructed by using five years of meteorologic data, measured at a weather station at the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The model inputs consisted of daily rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and the day of the year. The model outputs were daily soil temperatures at the depths of 100, 500 and 1500 mm. The estimated Values were found to be close to the measured values, as shown by a root-mean-square error ranging from 0.59 to 1.82 degrees C, a standard deviation of errors from 0.61 to 1.81 degrees C, and a coefficient of determination from 0.937 to 0.987. Therefore, it is concluded that ANN models can be used to estimate soil temperature by considering routinely measured meteorologic parameters.

Rates of gastric evacuation were faster than have previously been measured for sharks. The time for 80% of the meal weight (dry) to be evacuated ranged from 5.4 to 22.1 h. Daily ration was estimated using two different methods based on gastric evacuation rates and stomach content data. Estimates ranged from 2.12% to 3.54% of the body weight, which is relatively high compared to other elasmobranchs, but lower than estimates of maintenance ration for juvenile scalloped hammerheads.

Subjects slept on 2 different occasions. After a night of wakefulness, subjects were assigned to bed at 0800 h the following morning. Lights were turned off either at 1100 or 1500 h to enable sleep. Effects of diurnal sleep were evaluated by comparing blood hormone concentrations during the interval from 1100-1500 h between subjects when sleeping and awake. Comparing hormonal concentrations during the 4 h of sleep after 1100 h with those during the 4-h sleep interval after 1500 h provided evidence for an influence of circadian rhythm on cortisol and LH release.

Many arid-adapted endotherms already experience conditions at their physiological limits, so it is conceivable that they could be similarly affected by warming temperatures. We explored how climatic variables might influence the apparent survival of the banner-tailed kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis), a rodent endemic to the Chihuahuan Desert of North America and renowned for its behavioral and physiological adaptations to arid environments. Relative variable weight, strength of variable relationships, and other criteria indicated that summer, diurnal land surface temperature (SD_LST) was the primary environmental driver of apparent survival in these arid-adapted rodents. Higher temperatures had a negative effect on apparent survival, which ranged from 0.15 (SE = 0.04) for subadults to 0.50 (SE = 0.07) for adults. Elevated SD_LST may negatively influence survival through multiple pathways, including increased water loss and energy expenditure that could lead to chronic stress and/or hyperthermia that could cause direct mortality. Land surface temperatures are predicted to increase by as much 6.5A degrees C by 2099, reducing apparent survival of adults to similar to 0.15 in some regions of the species' range, possibly causing a shift in their distribution. The relationship between SD_LST and survival suggests a mechanism whereby physiological tolerances are exceeded resulting in a reduction to individual fitness that may ultimately cause a shift in the species' range over time.",,,,,"Frey, Jennifer K./F-8945-2011","Frey, Jennifer K./0000-0002-0122-2567",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,JAN,2012,168,1,,,,,257,268,,10.1007/s00442-011-2073-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-011-2073-2,,,,,,,,21833644,,,,,WOS:000299058100024,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature reductions were imposed only while the plants were under black cloth using a combination of air-conditioning and under-cloth ventilation. The two heat-sensitive cultivars tested were 'Yellow Mandalay' and 'Coral Charm' and the two heat-tolerant cultivars were 'Iridon' and 'Dark Bronze Charm'. Differences in time-to-flower (TTF) between heat tolerance classifications were less than anticipated. TTF was affected the most in 'Iridon', a heat-tolerant cultivar, decreasing by an average of 4.2 days/degrees C as mean diurnal temperatures (MT) decreased from about 26 degrees C to about 23 degrees C. TTF was affected the least in 'Coral Charm', a heat-sensitive cultivar, decreasing by an average of 2.8 days/degrees C over the same range. Inflorescence diameter, on the other hand, increased by as much as 9% in the two heat-sensitive cultivars but by only about 4% in the heat-tolerant cultivars.

We determined the temperature tolerance range of the crab to be between 10.5 and 26 degrees C based on behavioral assays, along with mapping the likely effect of climate change on its biogeographic range using this temperature tolerance and the history of collections to inform a MaxEnt model. We found that N. macropa is not likely to change its geographic range in the next 70 years. It has a relatively wide temperature tolerance range (15.5 degrees C) for a tropical animal, probably due to the wide daily temperature swing present on the Bogota Plain.

Distributional methods, which are among the simplest to implement, are also among the most widely used, either by themselves or in conjunction with more complex approaches. Here, building off of earlier work we evaluate the performance of seven methods in this class that range widely in their degree of complexity. We employ daily maximum temperature over the Continental U.S. in a Perfect Model approach in which the output from a large-scale dynamical model is used as a proxy for both observations and model output. Importantly, this experimental design allows one to estimate expected performance under a future high-emissions climate-change scenario. We examine skill over the full distribution as well in the tails, seasonal variations in skill, and the ability to reproduce the climate change signal. Viewed broadly, there generally are modest overall differences in performance across the majority of the methods. However, the choice of philosophical paradigms used to define the downscaling algorithms divides the seven methods into two classes, of better versus poorer overall performance. In particular, the bias-correction plus change-factor approach performs better overall than the bias-correction only approach. Finally, we examine the performance of some special tail treatments that we introduced in earlier work which were based on extensions of a widely used existing scheme. We find that our tail treatments provide a further enhancement in downscaling extremes.",,,,,"Dixon, Keith W/L-7120-2015; Lanzante, John/G-7643-2019","Dixon, Keith W/0000-0003-3044-326X; Lanzante, John/0000-0002-1736-7170",,,,,,,,,,,,,0899-8418,1097-0088,,,,MAR 15,2020,40,3,,,,,1571,1585,,10.1002/joc.6288,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.6288,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000517497800015,View Full Record in Web of Science

This reveals that most of the glacier area is characterized by near-plug-flow conditions, while some sticky spots are also identified. We then conduct experiments to test the sensitivity of the glacier flow to basal lubrication and tidal forcing at the calving front. Reduction of the basal drag by 10-40% produces speed-ups that agree approximately with the observed range of speed-ups that result from warm weather and precipitation events. In agreement with the observations, tidal forcing and surface speed near the calving front are found to be in anti-phase (high tide corresponds to low speed, and vice versa).

A nested-scale experimental watershed study design was used to test T-w model predictions in a representative mixed-use urbanizing watershed of the central USA. The linear regression T-w model used in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a non-linear regression T-w model, and a process-based T-w model that accounts for watershed hydrology were evaluated. The non-linear regression T-w model tested at a daily time step performed significantly (P<0.01) better than the linear T-w model currently used in SWAT. Both regression T-w models overestimated T-w in lower temperature ranges (T-w<10.0 degrees C) with percent bias (PBIAS) values ranging from -28.2% (non-linear T-w model) to -66.1% (linear regression T-w model) and underestimated T-w in the higher temperature range (T-w>25.0 degrees C) by 3.2%, and 7.2%, respectively. Conversely, the process-based T-w model closely estimated T-w in lower temperature ranges (PBIAS=4.5%) and only slightly underestimated T-w in the higher temperature range (PBIAS=1.7%). Findings illustrate the benefit of integrating process-based T-w models with hydrologic models to improve model transferability and T-w predictive confidence in urban mixed-land use watersheds. The findings in this work are distinct geographically and in terms of mixed-land use complexity and are therefore of immediate value to land-use managers in similarly urbanizing watersheds globally.

Hatchlings from an XX male-XX female cross were reared at 23 +/- 0.5 degrees C until Day 12 (days after fertilization), and divided into experimental groups reared at 15, 17, 20, 23, 25, 28 or 30 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The proportions of females were 94.6% at 15 degrees C, 100% at 17 degrees C, 94.6% at 20 degrees C 90.5% at 23 degrees C 46.6% at 25 degrees C, 15.4% at 28 degrees C, and 7.7% at 30 0.5 degrees C. This result confirms that genotypic females can be changed to phenotypic males by high temperature treatment. To determine the temperature sensitive period (TSP) of sex differentiation, the sex ratio was measured in groups of larvae shifted reciprocally between 23 and 30 degrees C as development progressed. The percentage of females increased in test groups shifted from 23 to 30 degrees C at Days 17, 22 and 27 and decreased in groups shifted from 30 to 23 degrees C at Day 17 and 22. The end point of the TSP occurs on Day 17 at 30 degrees C and on Day 22 at 23 degrees C, implying that the TSP is shortened at higher temperatures. To investigate the effect of fluctuating temperatures on sex differentiation, several one-day temperature pulses from 23 to 30 degrees C or 30 to 23 degrees C were applied, during the TSP. The pulse to 23 degrees C, from the basal temperature of 30 degrees C, resulted in a decreased percentage of males, however, the pulse to 30 degrees C, from the basal temperature of 23 degrees C, had no effect on the sex ratio. Theses results show that high temperature must be maintained during the TSP in order to produce a high proportion of masculinized genetic female goldfish. In conclusion, water temperature can play an important role in the process of sex differentiation in goldfish, as has been seen in other teleosts and reptiles, and be applied to aquaculture as a tool for control of sex.

The scattering of sunlight by sulphate aerosols is represented by appropriately enhancing the surface albedo. On doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, the global mean temperature increases by 5.2 K. An integration with a 39% increase in CO2, giving the estimated change in radiative heating due to increases in greenhouse gases since 1900, produced an equilibrium warming of 2.3 K, which, even allowing for oceanic inertia, is significantly higher than the observed warming over the same period. Furthermore, the simulation suggests a substantial warming everywhere, whereas the observations indicate isolated regions of cooling, including parts of the northern midlatitude continents. The addition of an estimate of the effect of scattering by current industrial aerosols (uncertain by a factor of at least 3) leads to improved agreement with the observed pattern of changes over the northern continents and reduces the global mean warming by about 30%. Doubling the aerosol forcing produces patterns that are still compatible with the observations, but further increase leads to unrealistically extensive cooling in the midlatitudes. The diurnal range of surface temperature decreases over most of the northern extratropics on increasing CO2, in agreement with recent observations. The addition of the current industrial aerosol had little detectable effect on the diurnal range in the model because the direct effect of reduced solar heating at the surface is approximately balanced by the indirect effects of cooling. Thus, the ratio of the reduction in diurnal range to the mean warming is increased, in closer agreement with observations. Results from further sensitivity experiments with larger increases in aerosol and CO2 are presented. Although the aerosol forcing is a strong maximum in the northern midlatitudes in summer, the response is fairly even throughout the year because sea ice feedbacks amplify the cooling in winter.

Using a new statistical approach, we quantified the consistency in nocturnal metabolic rate across a temperature range in zebra finches (N=3213 measurements on 407 individuals) living permanently in eight outdoor aviaries. Foraging conditions were either benign or harsh, and body mass and mass-adjusted BMR (BMRm) and SMR (SMRm) were lower in individuals living in a harsh foraging environment. The correlation between SMRm at different T-a was high (r=0.91), independent of foraging environment, showing that individuals are consistently ranked according to their SMRm. However, the correlations between BMRm and SMRm were always lower (average: r=0.29; range: 0<r<0.50), in particular in the benign foraging environment. Variation in metabolic response to lower T-a at least in part reflected differential body temperature (T-b) regulation: early morning T-b was lower at low T-a, and more so in individuals with a weaker metabolic response to lower T-a. Our findings have implications for the use of BMR in the estimation of time-energy budgets and comparative analyses: we suggest that the use of metabolic rates at ecologically relevant T-a, such as the easily tractable SMR, will be more informative than the use of BMR as a proxy for energy turnover.",,,,,"Verhulst, Simon/B-1613-2009; Verhulst, Simon/S-3404-2019","Verhulst, Simon/0000-0002-1143-6868; Verhulst, Simon/0000-0002-1143-6868; Briga, Michael/0000-0003-3160-0407",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,SEP 15,2017,220,18,,,,,3280,3289,,10.1242/jeb.160069,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.160069,,,,,,,,28684463,,,,,WOS:000411199600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Shallow groundwater temperatures, along with bed temperature profiles at depths of 1 to 30cm, were recorded at 10-min intervals in two hydrologically distinct reaches beginning in 2003 or 2004, depending on the site. The lower reach had smaller discharge contributions via lateral inflow from the hillslopes and fewer areas with upwelling (UW) and/or neutral flow across the stream bed compared to the middle reach. Bed temperatures were greater than those of shallow groundwater during summer, with higher temperatures in areas of downwelling (DW) flow compared to areas of neutral and UW flow. A paired-catchment analysis revealed that partial-retention forest harvesting in autumn 2004 resulted in higher daily maximum stream and bed temperatures but smaller changes in daily minima. Changes in daily maximum stream temperature, averaged over July and August of the post-harvest year, ranged from 1.6 to 3 degrees C at different locations within the cut block. Post-harvest changes in bed temperature in the lower reach were smaller than the changes in stream temperature, greater at sites with DW flow, and decreased with depth at both UW and DW sites, dropping to about 1 degrees C at a depth of 30cm. In the middle reach, changes in daily maximum bed temperature, averaged over July and August, were generally about 1 degrees C and did not vary significantly with depth. The pre-harvest regression models for shallow groundwater were not suitable for applying the paired-catchment analysis to estimate the effects of harvesting. However, shallow groundwater was warmer at the lower reach following harvesting, despite generally cooler weather compared to the pre-harvest year.

Stored grain temperature is a key physical variable for grain quality control and management in stored-grain ecosystem. In this study, a prediction model using Fourier series based on least-squares method is introduced to describe the average temperature movement of grain pile and the daily air temperature, naming hysteresis cycle model (HCM). Then the HCM based on the Fourier analysis is proposed that incorporating with the least-squares method, the Fourier series model is applied to forecast the grain pile temperature from the daily air temperature. The HCM is built by finding relationship called conversion coefficients between the air and grain pile temperature that is constructed on the basis of Fourier analysis, and the optimal order of the model is determined by Akaike information criteria. Our method can reflect the time lag of the grain pile temperature changes with the change of air temperature and requires only a single variable (i.e. air temperature). Experiments including model fitting, temperature prediction, and results comparison for a period of 425 days from a real-world granary, yield satisfied results agreeing well with actual observation values. As a result of model validation, the proposed method has the root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 1.6 degrees C to 2.3 degrees C with average RMSE of 1.9 degrees C. In other words, the proposed model can predict grain pile temperature with a high accuracy once an acceptable relationship between air temperature and grain pile temperature has been constructed from previously temperature data.

In this paper, we demonstrate how the model can be fitted to vital rates (i.e., rates associated with development, survival, hatching, and oviposition) of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae (Koch)) exposed to different constant temperatures ranging from 15 degrees C to 37.5 degrees C. SANDY was incorporated into an age-, stage- and sex-structured dynamic model, which was fitted to cohort life-tables of T. urticae conducted at five constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C). Age-and temperature-dependent vital rates for the three main stages (eggs, immatures, and adults) constituting the life-cycle of mites were adequately described by the SANDY model. The modeling approach allows for simulating the growth of a population in a variable environment. We compared the predicted net reproductive rate (R0) and intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) at fluctuating temperatures with empirical values obtained from life-table experiments conducted at temperatures that changed with a daily amplitude (+/- 0, +/- 3, +/- 6, +/- 9, and +/- 12 degrees C) around an average of 22 degrees C. Results show that R-0 decreases with increasing amplitude, while r(m) is more robust to variable temperatures. An advantage of SANDY is that the same simple mathematical expression can be applied to describe all the vital rates. Besides, the approach is not confined to modeling the influence of a single factor on population growth but allows for incorporating the combined effect of several limiting factors, provided that the combined effect of the factors is multiplicative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-225X,1938-2936,,,,JUN,2015,44,3,,,,,821,834,,10.1093/ee/nvv056,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvv056,,,,,,,,26313989,,,,,WOS:000356183700041,View Full Record in Web of Science

The photosynthetic temperature optimum of recently expanded leaves in the sun canopy was linearly related to the average temperature of the preceding week during the 9-month measurement period. The optimum temperature for net photosynthesis of E. globulus increased from 17 to 23 degrees C as the mean daily temperature increased from 7 to 16 degrees C. Similarly, the optimum temperature for net photosynthesis off. nitens increased from 14 to 20 degrees C as the mean daily temperature increased from 7 to 19 degrees C. The temperature for maximum photosynthetic response of E. globulus and E. nitens was similar at each measurement time, but the photosynthetic performance of E. nitens was less sensitive to temperatures above and below this optimum than that of E. globulus. In December, the apical shoots of branches of E. globulus had a net photosynthetic temperature optimum of between 10 and 15 degrees C. The corresponding values for expanding leaves, fully expanded leaves from the current year's growth, and fully expanded leaves from the previous year's growth were 15, 20 and 20-25 degrees C, respectively. In a second experiment, E. globulus clones taken from four mother plants originating from climatically dissimilar locations within Tasmania were acclimated at day/night temperatures of 10/15, 18/23 and 25/30 degrees C in temperature-controlled greenhouses. Another set of clones was acclimated in a shade-house where temperatures ranged between 10 and 25 degrees C and with a mean daily temperature of approximately 15 degrees C. Plants grown at 25/30 degrees C had significantly lower net photosynthetic rates when measured at 10 and 20 ''C than plants grown at lower temperatures. Plants grown at 10/15 ''C had significantly lower net photosynthetic rates when measured at 30 OC than plants grown at higher temperatures. Plants grown at the ambient conditions prevailing in midautumn in Hobart had significafitly higher net photosynthetic rates at 20 OC than plants raised in the greenhouses and were equal best performers at 10 and 30 degrees C. A comparison of the light response curves of the plants showed that the maximum rate of net photosynthesis was affected by the growth temperature, whereas the apparent quantum efficiency remained unchanged. There were no significant differences in the photosynthetic temperature responses of the four genotypes derived from climatically dissimilar locations within Tasmania. A comparison of temperature response models for E. globulus indicated that incomplete acclimation (defined by a slope value of less than 1 for the linear relationship between the temperature optimum for photosynthesis and the growth temperature) generally resulted in a greater daily carbon uptake than complete acclimation (slope value of 1).",,,,,"beadle, chris l/C-9390-2011; Battaglia, MIchael/A-5545-2011","Battaglia, MIchael/0000-0003-0144-5442",,,,,,,,,,,,,0829-318X,1758-4469,,,,JAN-FEB,1996,16,1-2,,,,,81,89,,,,,,,,,,,14871750,,,,,WOS:A1996TT02400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

We aimed to characterise the coincidence of yield variations with weather variable for potato in northern China using long-term datasets. Daily climate variables obtained from 607 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2014, detailed field experimental data for the period of 1982 to 2012 in northern China, and multivariate linear statistical model were used in this study. In particular, the first difference method was used to disentangle the contributions-of climate change to-potato yield. We concluded that during the potato growing, the average daily, maximum and minimum temperatures significantly increased by 0.23 degrees C per decade, 0.20 degrees C per decade and 0.36 degrees C per decade from 1961 to 2014 in northern China, respectively. However, average total radiation, total annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from April to September all exhibited downward trends, but the variation of evapotranspiration (-9.99 mm per decade) was greater than that of precipitation (-2.65 mm per decade). The key climatic factors limiting potato yields in northern China over the past 30 years at a regional scale were diurnal temperature range, precipitation, radiation and ET0. The potato yield in northern China was the most sensitive to variation of the diurnal temperature range followed by radiation, precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0). Specifically, when the diurnal temperature range decreased 1 degrees C, the potato yield increased 543.9 kg.ha(-1). When the total radiation decreased 1 MJ.m(2), the potato yield increased 63.8 kg.ha(-1). When the ET0 decreased 1 mm, the potato yield increased 62.7 kg.ha(-1).

Therefore, we performed a three-year field warming experiment with free air temperature increase (FATI) facility to investigate the actual response of midseason rice growth in East China. There were four treatments (AW: all-day warming; DW: daytime warming; NW: nighttime warming; CK: ambient control) with three replicates. This FATI facility presented a good simulation of the local air temperature pattern with an increase in the daily mean temperature of about 1.1-2.0 degrees C during rice whole growth duration compared to the ambient control. Warming shortened the pre-heading phase respectively by 3.3 d, 1.7 d and 2.0 d in the AW. DW and NW plots, while the post-heading phase stayed almost unchanged. During the three years, warming slightly decreased the aboveground biomass by an average of 9.1%, 10.3% and 3.3%, and the grain yield by an average of 0.9%, 6.4% and 6.1% in the AW, DW and NW plots, respectively. Warming tended to decrease rice photosynthesis rate and stimulate the nighttime respiration rate. It also enlarged the flag leaf area and increased its chlorophyll content. No significant difference and interaction in the actual response of rice growth were found between the warming regimes. The above evidences suggest that the expected warming less than 2.0 degrees C may not cause significant decrease in rice productivity in East China. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the effect of both daily downward and daily upward temperature fluctuations has been studied. In the daily downward temperature fluctuation regime the temperatures of each reactor was reduced by 10 degreesC for 10 h while in the daily upward fluctuation regime the temperature of each reactor was increased 10 degreesC for 5 h. The results show that the methane production rate at 60 degreesC is lower than that at 50 degreesC at all experimental conditions of imposed HRT except when downward temperature fluctuations were applied at an HRT of 10 days. It also was found that the free ammonia concentration not only affects the acetate-utilising bacteria but also the hydrolysis and acidification process. The upward temperature fluctuation affects the maximum specific methanogenesis activity more severely as compared to imposed downward temperature fluctuations. The results clearly reveal the possibility of using available solar energy at daytime to heat up the reactor(s) without the need of heat storage during nights, especially at an operational temperature of 50 degreesC and at a 20 days HRT, and without the jeopardising of the overheating.

Results showed that climate had stronger effects on rhizosphere bacterial communities than rice variety. The rhizosphere bacterial diversity differed significantly among the three climatic regions and positively correlated with the mean daily average temperature (MAveT), mean daily maximum temperature (MMaxT), and mean daily minimum temperature (MMinT), and negatively correlated with the daily temperature range (DTR). Principal co-ordinate analysis revealed that bulk soil bacterial communities maintained a high similarity across the three climatic regions, while rhizosphere bacterial communities notably varied. This change was significantly correlated with MAveT, MMaxT, MMinT, and DTR. Compared with bulk soil, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were enriched in the rhizosphere, while Actinobacteria was depleted. Moreover, these changes were strengthened by increasing the temperature and decreasing DTR.

However, high-temporal-resolution precipitation observations may not be available to support the establishment of calibration methods, particularly in regions with low population density or in developing countries. We present a new method to produce calibrated hourly precipitation ensemble forecasts from daily observations. Precipitation forecasts are taken from a high-resolution convective-scale numerical weather prediction (NWP) model run at the hourly time step. We conduct three experiments to develop the new calibration method: (i) calibrate daily precipitation totals and disaggregate daily forecasts to hourly; (ii) generate pseudohourly observations from daily precipitation observations, and use these to calibrate hourly precipitation forecasts; and (iii) combine aspects of (i) and (ii). In all experiments, we use the existing Bayesian joint probability model to calibrate the forecasts and the well-known Schaake shuffle technique to instill realistic spatial and temporal correlations in the ensembles. As hourly observations are not available, we use hourly patterns from the NWP as the template for the Schaake shuffle. The daily member matching method (DMM), method (iii), produces the best-performing ensemble precipitation forecasts over a range of metrics for forecast accuracy, bias, and reliability. The DMM method performs very similarly to the ideal case where hourly observations are available to calibrate forecasts.

The influence of temperature probe setup on the accuracy of vertical water flux calculation was systematically evaluated in this experimental study. Four temperature probe setups were installed into a sand box experiment to measure temporal highly resolved vertical temperature profiles under controlled water fluxes in the range of +/- 1.3 md(-1). Pass band filtering provided amplitude differences and phase shifts of the diurnal temperature signal varying with depth depending on water flux. Amplitude ratios of setups directly installed into the saturated sediment significantly varied with sand box hydraulic gradients. Amplitude ratios provided an accurate basis for the analytical calculation of water flow velocities, which matched measured flow velocities. Calculated flow velocities were sensitive to thermal properties of saturated sediment and to temperature sensor spacing, but insensitive to thermal dispersivity equal to solute dispersivity. Amplitude ratios of temperature probe setups indirectly installed into piezometer pipes were influenced by thermal exchange processes within the pipes and significantly varied with water flux direction only.

The only input variable, necessary to run the model, is a time series of daily mean air temperature. The simulator employs 9 empirical parameters, which were estimated by inverse modeling. The model, which primarily addresses forested sites, incorporates the effect of snow cover and soil freezing on soil temperature. The model was applied to several temperate forest sites, managing the split between Central Europe (Austria) and the United States (Harvard Forest, Massachusetts; Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire), aiming to cover a broad range of site characteristics. Investigated stands differ fundamentally in stand composition, elevation, exposition, annual mean temperature, precipitation regime, as well as in the duration of winter snow cover. At last, to explore the limits of the formulation, the simulator was applied to non-forest sites (Illinois), where soil temperature was recorded under short cut grass. The model was parameterized, specifically to site and measurement depth. After calibration of the model, an evaluation was performed, using similar to 50 % of the available data. In each case, the simulator was capable to deliver a feasible prediction of soil temperature in the validation time interval. To evaluate the practical suitability of the simulator, the minimum amount of soil temperature point measurements, necessary to yield expedient model performance was determined. In the investigated case 13-20 point observations, uniformly distributed within an 11-year timeframe, have been proven sufficient to yield sound model performance (root mean square error <0.9 degrees C, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency >0.97).

Temperature profiles measured with a microwave radiometer were used to study the characteristics of surface-based temperature inversions over the course of a year. Statistics of temperature profiles for every month are discussed; the difference between daytime and nocturnal cases observed during the summer months disappears during winter. Surface-based temperature inversions occurred in 70 % of the time during summer, and almost all of the time during winter. During winter the occurrence of warming events leads to a decrease in the temperature difference between the top and the base of the inversion (i.e. the inversion strength). The inversion strength maxima ranged between (December) and (August) corresponding to gradients of 0.1 and , respectively. The average surface-based inversion height presents a daily cycle during the summer months with values up to 200 m in the morning hours, while it affects a layer always deeper than 100 m during the winter months. The relationships between inversion strength and the downward longwave radiative flux, absolute temperature, and wind speed are examined. The inversion strength decreases as the longwave radiation increases. A clear anti-correlation between inversion strength and near-surface temperature is evident throughout the year.

Continuing adaptation to climatic conditions in temperate areas would probably result in a spread to more northern European countries, producing an increasing risk of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission over a much greater area. Based on previous studies showing that Ae. albopictus is able to overwinter in Germany, this study aims to determine more exactly its ecological limits of enduring low temperatures.MethodsNon-diapausing and experimentally induced diapausing eggs of three different Ae. albopictus strains (tropical, subtropical and temperate origins) were exposed to four different regimes with constant temperatures and three different regimes with fluctuating temperatures in a course of a day for a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 30 days. The hatching rate of larvae after cold exposure of the eggs was taken as a measure of cold tolerance.ResultsThe experiments showed that the tropical Ae. albopictus strain had a lower cold tolerance than the subtropical and the temperate strains. The eggs of all used strains were able to survive constant temperatures as low as -5 degrees C for an exposure period of 30 days, while constant temperatures as low as -10 degrees C were endured for 2 days by the tropical strain and for 10 and 20 days by the subtropical and temperate strains, respectively. At fluctuating temperatures, both the subtropical and the temperate strains exhibited hatching under all temperature regimes, even with a minimum temperature of -10 degrees C, whereas the tropical strain ceased hatching after an exposure period of 30 days under the temperature regime with a minimum temperature of -10 degrees C. The analyses showed that the temperature played the major role in interpreting the hatching rates of the eggs. The condition, whether the eggs were diapausing or not, had no significant influence, although results indicated a slightly higher cold tolerance of diapausing eggs at -10 degrees C.ConclusionsIt must be expected that subtropical and temperate strains of Ae. albopictus are able to withstand common central European winters and are able to establish in considerable parts of the continent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1756-3305,,,,,NOV 23,2020,13,1,,,,,,,587,10.1186/s13071-020-04386-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04386-7,,,,,,,,33225979,,,,,WOS:000595842100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Firstly, three indexes of basal metabolism (oxygen consumption rate, OCR; ammonia excretion rate, AER; and CO2 emission rate, CER), patterns of diurnal rhythm and O: N ratios were measured for three size ranges (large: h = 25.54 +/- 1.96 mm, medium: h = 22.07 +/- 1.33 mm and small: h = 17.70 +/- 1.43 mm) at two salinities (0.3% and 1.8%).

(2) no significant difference was found between two salinities for the O: N ratios of the small and large size, but a significant difference was found for the medium-sized one; (3) however, there were similar and distinct diurnal rhythms of metabolic rate at two salinities over a 24 hour period in three size C. fluminea.

Our results of the small C. fluminea were as follows: there was no significant difference in the O: N ratios among the five temperatures and two salinity treatments; and no significant difference of three indexes between both salinity levels were observed at same temperature controlled; and three indexes increased significantly with increasing temperature from 4 degrees C to 25 degrees C, while no significant difference was observed in the 25-32 degrees C range; and the highest Q(10) coefficients (Q(10) = 1.825 at salinity of 0.3% and Q(10) = 1.683 at salinity of 1.8%) were observed at the 18-25 degrees C temperature increase, and the low values were found in the 4-11 degrees C, 11-18 degrees C and 25-32 degrees C interval.

Here, we examined life histories of fall armyworm (FAW), a globally important invasive species with a broad ecological niche, at five constant temperatures of 13, 19, 25, 31 and 37 degrees C, to study life-history responses to different temperatures. RESULTS In our experiment, FAW had lower lifetime fecundity at unfavorable temperatures, a finding that is consistent with the idea that FAW can shift resources from reproduction to other functions under stressful conditions-such as heat or cold tolerance. Given the adverse effects of stressful temperatures, life-history strategies arise from individuals having limited remaining resources to allocate towards vital functions like survival or reproduction. Here we show plasticity in life-history strategies adopted at different temperatures. Rather than simply varying along a fast-slow continuum, FAW at unfavorably high temperatures exhibited lower daily fecundity and longer reproductive lifespans, and at unfavorably low temperatures showed a shorter peak in reproduction later in life, compared with FAW at 25 degrees C. Such patterns, if adaptive, could suggest a strategy mitigating reproductive and mortality risk in unfavorable environments, however, this remains to be tested. CONCLUSION Our analysis suggests that the high invasion success of FAW may result from their ability to adjust life-history strategies, across a range of stressful temperatures, in a way that reduces not only mortality, but also fecundity loss. The adoption of such strategies may be instrumental for the global invasion success of FAW.",,,,,,"Head, Megan/0000-0002-8123-7661",,,,,,,,,,,,,1526-498X,1526-4998,,,,JUN,2022,78,6,,,,,2398,2404,,10.1002/ps.6867,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6867,,MAR 2022,,,,,,35277917,,,,,WOS:000772487200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used doubly labelled water to determine daily, daytime and night-time field metabolic and water-influx rates in breeding babblers in spring and nonbreeding babblers in winter and summer. Daily and daytime energy expenditure rates were higher during the breeding season than during either summer or winter, but there was no difference among seasons in night-time energy expenditure rates.

We evaluated the hypothesis that juvenile thermal tolerance determines northern range in gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), a species commonly caught as juveniles along the US Atlantic coast well north of their adult distribution, using a combined laboratory, field and modeling approach. The cumulative degree days below 17 degrees C (CDD<17) survived by individuals maintained in the laboratory under ambient seasonal cooling conditions were used to quantify the chronic effects of prolonged but non-lethal low temperatures. Under ambient conditions, juveniles stopped feeding below 11.3 degrees C, and the mean temperature at death was 10.2 degrees C (+/-0.74 S.D.). The CDD<17 endured by individuals ranged from 61.9 to 138.8 (8354+/-22.44 S.D.), and was positively related to fish size. The relation between CDD<17 and fish size was extrapolated to the maximum juvenile size in fall to provide an upper limit for survival in the wild (CDD<17 = 210 days). Acute low temperature tolerance was evaluated in a second experiment that exposed juveniles to a constant rate of temperature decline (3 degrees C where feeding ceased at 10.3 degrees C and death occurred at 7.0 degrees C (+/-0.45 S.D.). These thermal thresholds were combined with winter estuarine temperature data at 12 sites to evaluate potential overwinter survival along the US Atlantic coast. Of a total of 134 site-year combinations categorized based on the acute and chronic thresholds, the CDD<17 threshold (>210 days) was more limiting than the acute threshold (minimum daily temperature<7.0 degrees C) to survival of juveniles for a given site-year. To evaluate the relationship between juvenile thermal tolerance criteria and adult distributions, we quantified adult distribution using field observations in the western Atlantic Ocean compiled from a database of recreational divers. There was a strong correspondence between observations of adult gray snapper from the database of recreational divers vs. latitude with that of the predicted survival of juveniles vs. latitude from our analysis. The agreement between the laboratory-derived thermal tolerance metrics, the spatial distribution of winter temperature, and the distribution of adult gray snapper support the hypothesis that the adult range of gray snapper is largely limited by the overwinter survival of juveniles. Understanding the interaction between physiology and range is important for forecasting the impacts of climate change on other species of fish where juvenile tolerances are critical in determining range, particularly in seasonal systems.

The selected body temperature and the critical thermal maximum averaged 30.0 and 42.3 degrees C, respectively; the critical thermal minimum of males and females averaged 3.9 and 5.9 degrees C, respectively. 3. The lizards in May exhibited lower and more variable active body temperatures than did the lizards in July, because of lower and more variable air and substrate temperatures in May. 4. The sprint speed generally increased with body temperature within the range of 17 to 32 degrees C and decreased at temperatures >32 degrees C. 5. Within the range of 26 to 36 degrees C, body temperature influenced food assimilation primarily by affecting the food passage time, whereas it only slightly affected the daily food consumption, the apparent digestive coefficient and the assimilation efficiency. The food passage time decreased with increasing body temperature.

In this paper, we present how we combine passive microwave and thermal infrared data to estimate LST during summer snow-free periods over northern high latitudes. The methodology is based on the SSM/I-SSMIS 37 GHz measurements at both vertical and horizontal polarizations on a 25 km x 25 km grid size. LST is retrieved from brightness temperatures introducing an empirical linear relationship between emissivities at both polarizations as described in Royer and Poirier (2010). This relationship is calibrated at pixel scale, using cloud-free independent LST data from MODIS instruments. The SSM/I-SSMIS and MODIS data are synchronized by fitting a diurnal cycle model built on skin temperature reanalysis provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The resulting temperature dataset is provided at 25 km scale and at an hourly time step during the ten-year analysis period (2000-2011). This new product was locally evaluated at five experimental sites of the EU-PAGE21 project against air temperature measurements and meteorological model reanalysis, and compared to the MODIS LST product at both local and circumpolar scale. The results giving a mean RMSE of the order of 2.2 K demonstrate the usefulness of the microwave product, which is unaffected by clouds as opposed to thermal infrared products and offers a better resolution compared to model reanalysis.

Several experiments with different urbanization levels are carried out. Results indicate that the air temperature of heat wave events is sensitive to urban land cover and the urbanized warming intensifies along with urban expansion. The regional model performs better on the simulations of maximum and minimum 2-m air temperature when urban land cover is close to the observed value. Because of the urbanization effect, the surface skin temperature shows a maximum warming (similar to 2.5 degrees C) at daytime, while the maximum warming of 2-m air temperature (similar to 1.5 degrees C) occurs at nighttime. Consequently, an increased (a decreased) diurnal range in surface skin temperature (2-m air temperature) is induced. According to the diagnostic equations, the 2-m air temperature is not only related to surface skin temperature, but also regulated by surface sensible heat flux. At daytime, although the increased solar absorption and the decreased upward latent heat flux (due to the deficit of surface evaporation) sharply enhance the surface skin temperature in the higher urbanization experiment, the simultaneously increased sensible heat flux suppresses the 2-m air temperature. At nighttime, however, the difference in surface sensible heat flux is relatively small, thus 2-m air temperature largely depends on surface skin temperature influenced by ground heat release. This study emphasizes the different variations and physical mechanisms of surface skin temperature and 2-m air temperature under the urbanization in the PRD region.",,,,,,"Xiao, Zhixiang/0000-0003-1943-7969",,,,,,,,,,,,,1976-7633,1976-7951,,,,AUG,2019,55,3,,,,,373,386,,10.1007/s13143-018-0094-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13143-018-0094-z,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000477569700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Daily observations of mortality and behaviour were made over a 21-day period at sea temperatures ranging from 7 to 16degreesC in spring (April-May) and 11 to 14degreesC in August. During the spring experiment the tolerance of scallops, as expressed by mortality and behaviour, was distinctly reduced at sea temperatures above 12degreesC among scallops from Breidafjordur and Hunafloi and above 13degreesC among scallops from Hvalfjordur. During the second set of experiments, conducted in August, scallops were transported into the laboratory from a higher sea temperature than in the spring. As a result, mortality rates were much lower demonstrated by the fact that only scallops reared at sea temperature of 14degreesC died. This indicates that C. islandica may tolerate somewhat higher temperatures than have been observed in Icelandic waters in recent years.

However, in agriculturally important species, less is known about the expression of HSPs under natural environments. A review of the heat-shock response in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is presented and recent results on the expression of wheat HSPs under diurnal stress and field conditions are reported. In the field experiment, nag leaf blade temperatures were obtained and leaf blades collected for northern blot analysis using HSP 16.9 cDNA as a probe. Temperatures of leaf blades ranged from 32 to 35 degrees C under the tested field conditions at New Deal near Lubbock, Texas. Messenger RNAs encoding a major class of low molecular weight HSPs, HSP 16.9, were detected in all wheat genotypes examined. The results suggested that HSPs are synthesised in response to heat stress under agricultural production, and furthermore, that HSPs are produced in wheats differing in geographic background. In the controlled growth chamber experiment, HSP expression in two wheat cultivars, Mustang (heat tolerant) and Sturdy (heat susceptible) were analysed to determine if wheat genotypes differing in heat tolerance differ in in vitro HSP synthesis (translatable HSP mRNAs) under a chronic, diurnal heat-stress regime. Leaf tissues were collected from seedlings over a time-course and poly (A)(+) RNAs were isolated for in vitro translation and 2-D gel electrophoresis. The protein profiles shown in the 2-D gel analysis revealed that there were not only quantitative differences of individual HSPs between these two wheat lines, but also some unique HSPs which were only found in the heat tolerant line. This data provides evidence of a correlation between HSP synthesis and heat tolerance in wheat under a simulated field environment and suggests that further genetic analysis of HSPs in a segregating population is worthy of investigation. In conclusion, the results of this study provide an impetus for the investigation of the roles of HSP genes in heat tolerance in wheat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0310-7841,,,,,,1994,21,6,,,,,857,867,,10.1071/PP9940857,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/PP9940857,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994QF80600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

ENWATBAL, a mechanistic ET model, is such a model. Our objective was to test the model by comparing calculated values of ET, E, T, net irradiance (R-n), soil heat flux (G), and;oil surface temperature (T-s) with measured ones. Three field experiments were conducted throughout 1993-1995 in a structureless sandy soil either bare or planted with sorghum in Tottori, Japan. E was measured by lysimeter using both micro- and an in situ large weighing lysimeter, ET was measured with the weighing lysimeter, and T was calculated by difference (T = ET-E). In these experiments, R-n, G, and T-s were also measured using standard methods. Three statistical tests, i.e., bias, RMSE and linear regression analysis were used to evaluate model performance. In all three experiments, measured and calculated values of E and T from both a bare soil and a cropped surface were in agreement with a bias close to 0.0 mm day(-1) and RMSE <1.0 mm day(-1). In these comparisons, slopes and intercepts were not significantly (P = 0.05) different from 1.0 and 0.0, respectively. Furthermore, experimental results indicated that ENWATBAL correctly calculated daily ET with a bias = -0.60 mm day(-1), RMSE = 0.89 mm day(-1) and a slope and intercept not significantly different from 1.0 and zero. Measured and calculated values of R-n and G over a bare soil were also in agreement. However, there are differences between the midnight and diurnal values of measured and calculated T-s. Therefore, we concluded that the ENWATBAL model calculated ET, E, T, R-n, and G within an acceptable accuracy and range for the soil and environmental conditions of our test. It is suggested that for our soil, model accuracy on the calculation of E and T-s could be improved by including the formation of a dry topsoil layer. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

To explore such effects, a controlled experiment was conducted, where three temperature levels (i.e., 15, 20, and 25 degrees C) and five salinity levels (i.e., 0, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mmol/L) were crossed, resulting in 15 treatments (i.e., 3 temperature levels x 5 salinity levels). Three typical grass species (Festuca arundinacea, Bromus inermis, and Elymus breviaristatus) were used, and 25 seeds of each species were sown in petri dishes under these treatments. Germination percentages and germination rates were calculated on the basis of the daily recorded germinated seed numbers of each species. Results showed that temperature and salinity significantly affected seed germination percentage and germination rate, which differed among species. Specifically, F. arundinacea had the highest germination percentage, followed by E. breviaristatus and B. inermis, with a similar pattern also found regarding the accumulated germination rate and daily germination rate. Generally, F. arundinacea was not sensitive to temperature within the range of 15-25 degrees C, while the intermediate temperature level improved the germination percentage of B. inermis, and the highest temperature level benefited the germination percentage of E. breviaristatus. Moreover, F. arundinacea was also not sensitive to salinity within the range of 0-200 mmol/L, whereas high salinity levels significantly decreased the germination percentage of B. inermis and E. breviaristatus. Thus, temperature and salinity can jointly affect seed germination, but these differ among plant species.

The study represents daily variability of ambient VOCs and their various associated emission sources. Diurnal profiles have differed from one VOC to another as the result of their different origins and the influence of different meteorological parameters (i.e. solar radiation, temperature) and planetary boundary layer height (PBL-H). The hourly mixing ratios of Oxygenated-VOCs (OVOCs) and aromatics were in the ranges of 0.6-29 ppbv and 0.13-14 ppbv, respectively with OVOCs accounted for up to 75% of total measured VOCs.

Thermal interval for leaf tip appearance (phyllochron) is critical for predicting duration of vegetative development. Phyllochron in maize is shorter in temperate than in tropical and subtropical environments. As existing data has been evaluated in a narrow range of environments, underlying mechanisms that affect phyllochron have not been adequately examined. The objectives of this study were to quantify the response of phyllochron to environmental variables and determine its stability across maize cultivars, to aid modelers in developing tools which accurately predict phenology. Maize was grown in field experiments at Wageningen, The Netherlands, Temple, Texas, USA, and three sites in Mexico, and in controlled environments at Wageningen. The experiment at Temple included grain sorghum and shading treatments to alter irradiance of the crop. Detailed data on leaf production and environmental conditions were collected. These data were combined with published data from held studies. Maize phyllochron acclimated to temperature and increased as mean daily temperature before tassel initiation increased from 12.5 to 25.5 degrees C, and increased in maize and sorghum in response to low irradiance. Temperature was the dominant influence, with phyllochron increasing by 1.7 degrees Cd per degrees C increase in daily mean temperature, as daily mean temperature before tassel initiation increased from 12.5 to 25.5 degrees C, and declined or remained constant when mean daily temperature before tassel initiation exceeded 25.5 degrees C.

Temperature measurements in boreholes are used for solving a wide range of exploration, geophysical, environmental, hydrogeological, and geodynamic problems. The development of new temperature sensors and registration systems significantly expands the capabilities of borehole thermometry. This raises the requirements for measurement accuracy. However, these requirements often cannot be satisfied in real borehole conditions due to the influence of temperature noise caused by free thermal convection of the fluid. For effective planning of equipment and methods of temperature measurements in boreholes, it is necessary to evaluate the amplitude of temperature noise. The main aim of the research is to develop mathematical models for estimating the level of temperature noise caused by free thermal convection. Methods: statistical analysis of temperature records obtained from laboratory experiments, temperature logging and temperature monitoring in boreholes. Results. The optimal parameter for estimating temperature noise is the standard deviation of temperature fluctuations. Models of varying complexity have been developed that make it possible to estimate the amplitude of convective noise depending on the geothermal gradient, the internal radius of the borehole, and the Rayleigh number.

Thus, experiments manipulating multiple environmental factors concurrently provide valuable insight into the role of the environment in shaping not only important traits (e.g. dispersal capacity or reproduction), but also trait-trait interactions (e.g. trade-offs between traits). We used a multi-factorial design to manipulate variation in temperature (constant 28 degrees C vs. 28 +/- 5 degrees C daily cycle) and food availability (unlimited vs. intermittent access) throughout development in the sand field cricket (Gryllus firmus). Using a univariate approach, we found that temperature variability and unlimited food availability promoted survival, development, growth, body size and/or reproductive investment. Using principal components as indices of resource allocation strategy, we found that temperature variability and unlimited food reduced investment into flight capacity in females. Thus, we detected a sex-specific trade-off between flight and other life-history traits that was developmentally plastic in response to variation in temperature and food availability. We develop an experimental and statistical framework to reveal shifts in correlative patterns of investment into different life-history traits.

The degree of coupling between the land surface and PBL in numerical weather prediction and climate models remains largely unexplored and undiagnosed because of the complex interactions and feedbacks present across a range of scales. Furthermore, uncoupled systems or experiments [e. g., the Project for the Intercomparison of Land-Surface Parameterization Schemes (PILPS)] may lead to inaccurate water and energy cycle process understanding by neglecting feedback processes such as PBL-top entrainment. In this study, a framework for diagnosing local land-atmosphere coupling is presented using a coupled mesoscale model with a suite of PBL and land surface model (LSM) options along with observations during field experiments in the U. S. Southern Great Plains. Specifically, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) has been coupled to the Land Information System (LIS), which provides a flexible and high-resolution representation and initialization of land surface physics and states. Within this framework, the coupling established by each pairing of the available PBL schemes in WRF with the LSMs in LIS is evaluated in terms of the diurnal temperature and humidity evolution in the mixed layer. The coevolution of these variables and the convective PBL are sensitive to and, in fact, integrative of the dominant processes that govern the PBL budget, which are synthesized through the use of mixing diagrams. Results show how the sensitivity of land-atmosphere interactions to the specific choice of PBL scheme and LSM varies across surface moisture regimes and can be quantified and evaluated against observations. As such, this methodology provides a potential pathway to study factors controlling local land-atmosphere coupling (LoCo) using the LIS-WRF system, which will serve as a test bed for future experiments to evaluate coupling diagnostics within the community.",,,,,"Santanello, Joseph A/D-4438-2012; Peters-Lidard, Christa D/E-1429-2012; Santanello, Joseph/AAC-9642-2021; tao, wei/GXN-4445-2022; Kumar, Sujay V/B-8142-2015","Santanello, Joseph A/0000-0002-0807-6590; Peters-Lidard, Christa D/0000-0003-1255-2876; Santanello, Joseph/0000-0002-0807-6590; Kumar, Sujay V/0000-0001-8797-9482",,,,,,,,,,,,,1525-755X,1525-7541,,,,JUN,2009,10,3,,,,,577,599,,10.1175/2009JHM1066.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2009JHM1066.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000267420900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their deformation under cyclic traffic loads can greatly affect the performance of a pavement. Yet, the behaviour of unsaturated subgrade soils under cyclic loads at various temperatures and suctions is not fully understood. In this study, a new suction-and temperature-controlled cyclic triaxial apparatus was developed. Using temperature-compensated Hall effect transducers, the accumulated plastic axial and volumetric strains and resilient modulus of an unsaturated silt under cyclic loads were measured at suctions ranging from 0 to 60 kPa and temperatures ranging from 20 to 60 degrees C. Experimental results show that yield stress increases with increasing suction (suction-induced hardening), but decreases with increasing temperature (thermal-induced softening). Consequently, axial plastic strain accumulated during cyclic loading-unloading is larger at lower suctions and higher temperatures. At a given temperature, measured resilient modulus significantly increases when suction increases. On the other hand, the influence of temperature on resilient modulus depends on suction level. At zero suction, resilient modulus is slightly affected by temperature. At suction larger than zero, an increase in temperature induces an obvious decrease in resilient modulus. It is evident that thermal effects on resilient modulus are more significant at unsaturated than saturated states.",,,,,"Zhou, Chao/J-7145-2016","Zhou, Chao/0000-0002-9443-6707",,,,,,,,,,,,,0016-8505,1751-7656,,,,,2014,64,9,,,,,709,720,,10.1680/geot.14.P.015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/geot.14.P.015,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000344640100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This range limit may be determined by temperature during their planktonic larval phase. We examined the effect of temperature on survival and growth of larval ribbed mussels reared in the laboratory over 28 days at 15, 19, 23, and 28 degrees C. In daily samples, we enumerated live and dead larvae and measured shell length and width of live individuals. Larval survival was high and similar at temperatures >= 19 degrees C (e.g., proportion alive +/- SE; 0.88 +/- 0.02 after 3 wk), but was lower and more variable at 15 degrees C (e.g., 0.56 +/- 0.16 after 3 wk). Instantaneous mortality rates per d were > 2 times lower at >= 19 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. Larval growth rate increased with temperature, and Growing Degree Days (GDD) explained 85-95% of the variation in mean shell length. When larvae began settling, we measured the proportion of settlers in cohorts at 19, 23, and 28 degrees C; there was no settlement at 15 degrees C. Larval settlement occurred earlier at 28 degrees C (16 d) than 23 degrees C (18 d) and 19 degrees C (19 d). GDD significantly affected mean proportion of larvae settled, but only accounted for 29% of the variation. Our study demonstrates that GDD is a good predictor of larval growth for ribbed mussels and provides insights on larval developmental stages (e.g., potential timing of changes in resource allocation). Our study also provides support for the hypothesis that cold ocean temperatures ( <= 15 degrees C) may be a major limiting factor for successful development of larvae in the field and so for the dynamics of northern populations of ribbed mussels.",,,,,,"Metaxas, Anna/0000-0002-1935-6213; Virgin, Spencer/0000-0002-3066-0304; , Kevin/0000-0002-2231-3011",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,MAR,2019,512,,,,,,31,41,,10.1016/j.jembe.2018.11.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2018.11.006,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000457819300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Vertical transects of probes were deployed at Bridget Cove at +5.0 m (above the tidal range), +3.5, +2.5 m, +1.5 m and 0 m. Two additional probes were partially buried at +1.5 m; burial ameliorated freezing temperatures. Duration of emersion increased with intertidal height and was of longer duration at +3.5 m during Neap tides and at +1.5 and 0 m during Spring tides. Monthly measures of temperature were: average temperature, monthly maximum, average daily monthly maximum, average daily monthly minimum, and monthly minimum. Monthly maximum air temperature increased with tidal height. Winter average daily monthly minimum fell below 0 degrees C at the +3.5, +2.5, and +1.5 m tidal heights for the aerially exposed probes. The number of days when emersion temperature fell below 0 degrees C increased with intertidal height as did the number of hours per day.

Cows were exposed to HS 10 h daily for 21 d. Measurements of rectal temperature (RT) arid udder surface temperature were collected at 1000 and 1500 h (+/- 30 min). Vaginal temperature was monitored every 10 min using digital loggers, averaged over 1 h, and paired with corresponding rectal and udder surface terriperature data. In experiment 2, 12 multiparous Holstein cows experienced a Till ranging from 60 to 76 at 2000 to 1000 h and THI from 69 to 83 at 1000 to 2000 h (peaked at 83 from 1600 arid 1900 h), eliciting 10 h/d of HS for 7 d. Rectal and udder surface temperatures were analyzed at 0700 and 1500 h (+/- 30 min). Vaginal temperature was recorded and analyzed as indicated in experiment 1. Afternoon THI showed weak correlations with surface temperature (r = 0.19, n = 420 in experiment 1; r = 0.23, n = 84 in experiment 2), weak to moderate correlations with RT (r = 0.34, n = 366 in experiment 1; r = 0.26, n = 84 in experiment 2), arid moderate correlations with vaginal temperature (r = 0.34, n = 175 in experiment 1; r = 0.35, n = 40 in experiment 2).

Surface temperature showed moderate to strong correlations with RT (r = 0.57, n = 84) and vaginal temperature (r = 0.74, n = 37) in experiment 2. In conclusion, THI showed a weak to moderate relationship with core body temperatures and explained the increase in rectal and vaginal temperatures experienced by HS cows. Compared with rectal temperature, vaginal temperature showed stronger relationships with THI and can be used to determine thermal load. Udder surface temperature showed a moderate to strong relationship with core body temperature, and this relationship may support the use of surface temperature data to manage thermal load in HS cows.",,,,,"Ríus, Agustín/AAZ-3166-2020","Ríus, Agustín/0000-0001-5602-4990",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0302,1525-3198,,,,JUL,2018,101,7,,,,,6424,6429,,10.3168/jds.2017-13799,http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-13799,,,,,,,,29605321,,,,,WOS:000436481500067,View Full Record in Web of Science

The mostly continuous eddy covariance measurements permitted the study of methane dynamics at the hourly, daily and seasonal scales. To exclude data segments for which the biological methane fluxes were underestimated due to inefficient atmospheric transport under stable stratification, we applied a novel approach based on both the atmospheric stability parameter zeta = z/L and the friction velocity u*, where z is the measurement height and L the Obukhov length. The field measurements revealed the existence of at least one sustained ebullition event, triggered by low barometric pressures, a declining water table and increasing mechanical turbulence - suggesting that large-scale release of methane bubbles can be an important transport mechanism of methane in boreal bogs. The validity of similarity scaling for atmospheric methane under convective conditions was also assessed and the normalized standard deviations of methane concentrations did not scale well with C, highlighting the heterogeneity in natural methane production and release across the bog. Overall the hourly emissions ranged between -2.0 and 32.1 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), with a summertime mean of 2A mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). At the daily scale, the two main controls on methane emissions were found to be the water table position and the peat temperature at 03 m under the surface. Contrary to other studies, seasonal methane emissions peaked when the water table was at its maximum distance from the surface, around mid-August. No clear diurnal pattern could be found in methane emissions, indicating that methane was produced quite deep within the peat. The seasonal emissions were estimated at 4.4 g CH4 m(-2), and compared well with other observations over similar landscapes using different measurement techniques. Given that methane releases and transport are greatly affected by local characteristics such as climate and vegetative cover, this study emphasizes the need for further in situ continuous measurements of methane fluxes across northern peatlands.

In particular, little is known about the potential of tropical species to acclimate physiologically to future increases in temperature. Seedlings of 10 neo-tropical tree species from different functional groups were cultivated in controlled-environment chambers under four day/night temperature regimes between 30/22 C and 39/31 C. Under well-watered conditions, all species showed optimal growth at temperatures above those currently found in their native range. While non-pioneer species experienced catastrophic failure or a substantially reduced growth rate under the highest temperature regime employed (i.e. daily average of 35 C), growth in three lowland pioneers showed only a marginal reduction. In a subsequent experiment, three species (Ficus insipida, Ormosia macrocalyx, and Ochroma pyramidale) were cultivated at two temperatures determined as sub- and superoptimal for growth, but which resulted in similar biomass accumulation despite a 6C difference in growth temperature. Through reciprocal transfer and temperature adjustment, the role of thermal acclimation in photosynthesis and respiration was investigated.

J,"Oosthuizen, MK; Bennett, NC",,,,"Oosthuizen, Maria K.; Bennett, Nigel C.",,,Clocks Ticking in the Dark: A Review of Biological Rhythms in Subterranean African Mole-Rats,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Biological rhythms are rhythmic fluctuations of biological functions that occur in almost all organisms and on several time scales. These rhythms are generated endogenously and entail the coordination of physiological and behavioural processes to predictable, external environmental rhythms. The light-dark cycle is usually the most prominent environmental cue to which animals synchronise their rhythms. Biological rhythms are believed to provide an adaptive advantage to organisms. In the present review, we will examine the occurrence of circadian and seasonal rhythms in African mole-rats (family Bathyergidae). African mole-rats are strictly subterranean, they very rarely emerge aboveground and therefore, do not have regular access to environmental light. A key adaptation to their specialised habitat is a reduction in the visual system. Mole-rats exhibit both daily and seasonal rhythmicity in a range of behaviours and physiological variables, albeit to different degrees and with large variability. We review previous research on the entire circadian system of African mole-rats and discuss output rhythms in detail. Laboratory experiments imply that light remains the strongest zeitgeber for entrainment but in the absence of light, animals can entrain to ambient temperature rhythms. Field studies report that rhythmic daily and seasonal behaviour is displayed in their natural habitat. We suggest that ambient temperature and rainfall play an important role in the timing of rhythmic behaviour in mole-rats, and that they likely respond directly to these zeitgebers in the field rather than exhibit robust endogenous rhythms. In the light of climate change, these subterranean animals are buffered from the direct and immediate effects of changes in temperature and rainfall, partly because they do not have robust circadian rhythms, however, on a longer term they are vulnerable to changes in their food sources and dispersal abilities.",,,,,"Oosthuizen, Maria/K-7923-2012","Oosthuizen, Maria/0000-0001-6305-8283",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,APR 22,2022,10,,,,,,,,878533,10.3389/fevo.2022.878533,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.878533,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000876151300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The domain covers the entire tropics between 45 degrees S and 45 degrees N with a spatial resolution of about 45 km. In order to verify two radiation schemes and four cumulus convection schemes, eight experiments are performed with different combinations of physics parameterization schemes. The results show that eight experiments present reasonable spatial patterns of surface air temperature and precipitation in boreal summer, with the spatial correlation coefficient (COR) between simulated and observed temperature exceeding 0.95, and that between simulated and observed precipitation ranges from 0.65 to 0.82. The four experiments with the RRTMG radiation scheme show a better performance than the other four experiments with the CAM radiation scheme. In the four experiments with the RRTMG radiation scheme, the COR between simulated and observed surface air temperature is about 0.98, and that between simulated and observed precipitation ranges from 0.76 to 0.82. Comparatively, the two experiments using the new Tiedtke cumulus parameterization scheme can simulate better diurnal variation of precipitation in boreal summer than the other six experiments. In particular, for the diurnal cycle of precipitation over land and ocean, the experiment using the RRTMG radiation scheme and the new Tiedtke cumulus convection scheme shows that the peaks of precipitation rate appear at 0400 LST and 1600 LST, in agreement with observation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1674-2834,2376-6123,,,,,2019,12,3,,,,,192,200,,10.1080/16742834.2019.1590118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16742834.2019.1590118,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000469815800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hydrologic and biogeochemical processes occurring in these streams and their hyporheic zones strongly influence the flux of water, solutes, and sediment to the ice-covered lakes on the valley bottoms. The purpose of this study was to identify the dominant processes controlling water temperature in these polar desert streams and to investigate in particular the role of hyporheic exchange. In order to do this, we analyzed stream temperature patterns on basin-wide, longitudinal, and reach scales. In the basin-wide study, we examined stream temperature monitoring data for seven streams in the Lake Fryxell Basin. For the longitudinal study, we measured temperatures at seven sites along a 5-km length of Von Guerard Stream. Maximum temperatures in the Fryxell Basin streams ranged from 8 to 15 degrees C. Daily temperature changes in the streams averaged 6-9 degrees C. Stream temperature patterns showed strong diel cycles peaking at roughly the same time throughout the lake basin as well as along the longitudinal gradient of Von Guerard Stream. Further, temperature patterns closely matched the associated net shortwave radiation patterns. Von Guerard Stream experienced its greatest amount of warming, 3-6 degrees C, in a playa region and cooled below snowfields. Temperatures in several streams around Lake Fryxell converged on similar values for a given day as did temperatures in downstream reaches of Von Guerard Stream not influenced by snowfields suggesting that at a certain point instream warming and cooling processes balance one another. The reach-scale investigation involved conducting two dual-injection conservative tracer experiments at mid-day in a 143-m reach of Von Guerard Stream instrumented with temperature and specific conductance probes. In one experiment, snow was added to the stream to suppress the temperature maximum. Chloride data from monitoring wells installed in the streambed showed that streamwater was infiltrating into the streambed and was reaching the frozen boundary. Temperatures in the hyporheic zone were always cooler than temperatures in the stream. OTIS-P modeling of tracer experiment data indicated that significant hyporheic exchange occurred in both experiments. Reach and cross-sectional heat budgets were established with data obtained from the tracer experiments and from a nearby meteorological station. The budgets showed that net radiation accounted for 99% of the warming taking place in the experimental reach. This result, together with the streams' shallow depths and hence rapid response to meteorological conditions, explains the close linkage between stream temperature and net shortwave radiation patterns. Cross-sectional heat budgets also indicated that evaporation, convection, conduction, and hyporheic exchange contributed to 30%, 25-31%, 19-37%, and 6-21%, respectively, of the non-radiative heat losses in the experimental reach. Thus these processes all worked in conjunction to limit stream temperatures in the Dry Valleys' highly exposed environment. This contrasts with other streams in which convection and conduction may play a warming role. The cooling impact of hyporheic exchange was greater in a losing reach than in a gaining one, and increased hyporheic exchange may have lessened the contribution of conduction to the thermal budgets by decreasing streambed temperature gradients. The cooling contributions of evaporation and convection increased with stream temperature and may thus play a role in constraining stream temperature maxima. Finally, our data indicate that streams act as vectors of heat in the Lake Fryxell basin, not only warming the hyporheic zone and eroding the frozen boundary underlying the streams but also accumulating and carrying heat downstream, sending a thermal wave into the lake once a day.

It is usually described, using Arrhenius kinetics, as increasing with the stability of the substrate in laboratory conditions, where substrate availability is non-limiting and where chemical recalcitrance, therefore, predominantly regulates stability. However, conditions of non-limiting subtrate availability are rare in the undisturbed soil, where physicochemical protection of substrates may control their stability. The aim of this study was to assess the temperature sensitivity of decomposition of SOM with contrasting stability in the field. Our conceptual approach was based on in situ measurements of soil CO2 efflux at a range of temperatures from root exclusion plots of increasing age (1 month and three decades) and, therefore, with SOM of increasing stability. From a set of short-term measurements in spring, using diurnal temperature variation, the relative temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition decreased significantly (p < 0.0001) with increasing SOM stability, and was weak (Q(10) < 1.3) in long-term root exclusion plots. This result was confirmed in a similar set of short-term measurements repeated later in the year, in summer, as well as from an analysis perfomed at the seasonal timscale. We provide direct field evidence that the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition decreases with increasing stability, in direct contrast with Arrhenius kinetics prediction, and therefore show that stability of SOM in the field cannot be the sole result of chemical recalcitrance. We conclude that the physicochemical protection of SOM, which controls SOM stability in the field, constrains the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition under field conditions.

Although there is much research about the effect of daytime temperature during seed filling oil soybean yield in temperature-controlled chambers, the effect in the field has been little explored. Long-term manipulative field experiments are important tools to provide accurate information for revealing the impacts of climate change oil crop yields. Using the field records of a long-term fertilization experiment conducted in Northeast China, we analyzed the response of soybean yields to mean daily maximum temperature during seed filling over the period 1987-2007. The results showed that there was a clear positive response of soybean yields to increased mean daily maximum temperature during seed filling ranged from 20 to 24 degrees C. When compared with the average soybean yields over the last two decades, grain yields increased by 6-10% for each 1 degrees C increase in mean daily maximum temperature during seed filling and more than 22% of yield trends call be explained.

The first experiment stocked early stage nauplii into I L beakers and cultured them using standard procedures until five days after the first mature adults were observed; from this survival, sex ratio, time to maturation, and fecundity were measured. The second and third experiments evaluated the effects of temperature on nauplii production by stocking individual pairs and 25 pairs of adults, respectively; in both experiments nauplii production was determined daily for 10 days. The fourth experiment determined the effects of temperature on population growth and composition of the population produced by stocking 10 adult pairs and culturing them for 10 days at six temperatures. Results indicate survival from early nauplii to adult was significantly affected by temperature and those cultured from 24-30 degrees C had the highest mean survival. Time to first maturation and maturation of the entire population was significantly influenced by temperature and took from 6.8 to 12.8 days. Temperature significantly affected nauplii production in both individual and groups of paired adults. Temperature affected the mean daily nauplii production by decreasing the brood interval but did not affect the mean brood size. The number of nauplii produced by 25 adult pairs was significantly influenced by temperature; the optimal temperature was 27.5 degrees C at which 1861 nauplii were produced. The distribution of developmental stages in the population was also affected by temperature; at lower temperatures the population consisted of a greater proportion of nauplii while at 32 degrees C the population was comprised of more advanced staged individuals. When developing production objectives, aquaculturists must consider temperature because it has multiple effects on the culture of P. pelagicus. The optimal temperature range to achieve high survival and the greatest nauplii production is 26-30 degrees C. To maintain long-term stock cultures the best temperature may be 24 degrees C to slow maturation and growth while 28-32 degrees C may be used to maximize nauplii production by decreasing time to maturation and decreasing brood intervals.

Special attention is paid to the stable ABL. Limited-area model results for different ABL parameterizations and different radiation transfer parameterizations are compared with the in situ observations. Model forecasts were found to be sensitive to the choice of the ABL parameterization both during the day and at night. At night, forecasts are particularly sensitive to the radiation scheme. All three models underestimate the amplitude of the diurnal temperature cycle (DTR) and the near-surface wind speed. Furthermore, they overestimate the stable boundary layer height for windy conditions and underestimate the stratification of nighttime surface inversions. Favorable parameterizations for the stable boundary layer enable rapid surface cooling, and they have limited turbulent mixing. It was also found that a relatively large model domain is required to model the Great Plains low-level jet. A new scheme is implemented for the stable boundary layer in the Medium-range Forecast Model (MRF). This scheme introduces a vegetation layer, a new formulation for the soil heat flux, and turbulent mixing based on the local scaling hypothesis.

Carbon-use efficiency of plants (CUEp) and ecosystems (CUEe) represents the capacity of plants to capture C and ecosystems to store C fixed from the atmosphere, respectively. Few studies have examined how grassland CUE responds to asymmetric warming. As part of a long-term (2006-2016) field experiment that simulated daytime and nighttime warming in a semi-arid temperate steppe on the Mongolian Plateau, this study was conducted to examine the effects of daytime and nighttime warming on CUEp and CUEe. Nighttime warming, unlike daytime warming, increased CUEe by 54.2%, whereas neither nighttime nor daytime warming affected CUEp. Ecosystem-level CUE linearly increased with soil moisture but declined with soil temperature variation (CVST). The suppressed ER, which might have been driven by the reduced CVST, primarily contributed to the higher CUEe under nighttime warming. These observations indicate that a reduced DTR, associated with a warmer night under asymmetric diurnal climate warming, could increase the capacity of the temperate steppe transferring C into ecosystems by elevating CUEe, resulting more C sequestration.

Results: Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown under different temperature regimes and glucose availability conditions. These included glucose-excess batch cultures at different temperatures and glucose-limited chemostat cultures, subjected to fast linear temperature shifts and circadian sinoidal temperature cycles. An observed temperature-independent relation between intracellular levels of glycolytic metabolites and residual glucose concentration for all experimental conditions revealed that it is the substrate availability rather than temperature that determines intracellular metabolite profiles. This observation corresponded with predictions generated in silico with a kinetic model of yeast glycolysis, when the catalytic capacities of all glycolytic enzymes were set to share the same normalized temperature dependency.

Expanded polypropylene (EPP) beads and graphite powder are selected as the additives to change the thermal properties of HMA, and their effects on thermal and mechanical properties are evaluated experimentally. The test results show that the EPP modified HMA yields a reduction in thermal conductivity, heat capacity and indirect tensile strength up to 17, 32, and 27%, respectively. Conversely, replacing a part of traditional fillers with graphite powder increases indirect tensile strength and thermal conductivity up to 40 and 43%, respectively. A series of heat transfer analysis was conducted using a finite difference heat transfer model to investigate the effects of the thermally modified HMA on the pavement temperature gradient and surface temperature. The simulation results show that the amplitude of daily surface temperature variation reduces as the HMA thermal conductivity increases. The HMA containing 4.8% graphite by volume of the mixture reduces the daily surface temperature amplitude by 8.1% in the summer simulation and 9.6% in the winter simulation. The graphite modified HMA also has 1.5 degrees C lower maximum pavement surface temperature than the non-modified HMA in the simulation for a summer day at Texas. This implies that the modified HMA with improved thermal conductivity, such as the graphite modified one, is effective in mitigating thermal cracking, rutting and urban heat island effect. In addition, the improved indirect tensile strength of graphite modified HMA will bring extra extension of pavement service life.

An extreme cold event occurring in early 2008 offered a unique opportunity to examine the effect of cold-water anomalies on Porites lutea corals and their physiological tolerance and acclimation in the subtropical northern South China Sea (NSCS). Besides in-situ observation, a subsequent aquarium-based experiment was designed for reproducing the chilling process and a 50-year-long Sr/Ca ratio profile from two P. lutea skeletal slabs was analyzed for reconstructed the historical annual minimum SSTs which ceased Porites calcification. The 2008 low-temperature anomaly caused the minimum daily mean SSTs dropped below 13A degrees C in the Daya Bay. The stress symptoms displayed by local P. lutea colonies included polyp retraction, reduced coloration and pale, but none showed tissue sloughing. The ability of P. lutea to survive implied its tolerance of extreme low temperatures. Here we suggest a model on the tolerance of high-latitude Porites under low-temperature stresses, which is when SSTs drop below 18A degrees C, Porites corals contract their tentacles (losing heterotrophic capability), then cease calcification (reducing energy consumption), and meanwhile maintain relatively high levels of zooxanthellae density (sustaining host's life via photosynthetic capacity of symbiotic zooxanthellae). This study revealed remarkable acclimatization of P. lutea corals to low temperature extremes. This acclimatization is beneficial for Porites corals in the NSCS to expand their living ranges towards the higher-latitude areas and have the potential to be the incipient reef former.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0253-505X,1869-1099,,,,DEC,2016,35,12,,,,,58,64,,10.1007/s13131-016-0940-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13131-016-0940-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000391423600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the first experiment egg spawning was monitored every 2 hours in Females kept in individual vials at five constant temperatures. namely 9, 12, 15, 18 and 20 degrees C. In a second experiment, temperature was constant, 15 degrees C. Finally, a third experiment was conducted at three constant temperatures, 12, 15 and 20 degrees C under excess of food to determine temperature effects on egg production for a more extended period of rime. As food, a monoculture of Isochrysis galbana Parke was used For the first experiment and phytoplankton collected from tile same Bay cultured in F2 medium was used for the second and third experiments. In the first experiment clutch size (CS), defined as the total number of eggs laid at once within a 2 h period, ranged between 5 and 84 eggs female(-1). In most cases all the eggs were able to hatch and those that did not hatch were assumed as nonviable. CS was positively correlated to temperature, but only 2 out of 12 females were able to lay eggs at the lowest temperature (9 degrees C), whereas at the highest temperature (20 degrees C) CS tended to decline. There was a lack of synchrony in egg laying and no temperature effect on the number of nonviable eggs was detected. However a significant positive correlation between CS and the number of nonviable eggs was found (F-1,F-25=4.67, P<0.05). In the second experiment CS was highly variable, 36+/-degrees 18.67 (mean degrees S.D.) and not associated with either female length (F-1,F-26=1.86, P>0.05), or with female dry weight (F-1,F-26=0.026, P>0.05). Finally from the third experiment, egg production on a daily basis, was drastically reduced at 20 degrees C, while differences between 12 degrees C and 15 degrees C were not detected. Our results agree with previous studies indicating that egg production correlates positively with temperature. However, there appears to be an ''optimal temperature range'', within which maximal clutch sizes and daily egg production rates are attained. This temperature range coincides with that observed at the upper 10 m layer in the study area. This suggests that maximal egg production rates of this species would only take place at the upper layer. On the other hand, sharp population declines, such as that observed during ''El Nino'' 1991-92, may have been caused by abrupt changes in water temperature giving rise to a poor recruitment, because of depleted egg production taking place at temperatures greater than 20 degrees C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0716-078X,,,,,SEP,1996,69,3,,,,,365,377,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VZ66200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Energy expenditure",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many large mammals show pronounced seasonal fluctuations of metabolic rate (MR). It has been argued, based on studies in ruminants, that this variation merely results from different levels of locomotor activity (LA), and heat increment of feeding (HI). However, a recent study in red deer (Cervus elaphus) identified a previously unknown mechanism in ungulates-nocturnal hypometabolism-that contributed significantly to reduced energy expenditure, mainly during late winter. The relative contribution of these different mechanisms to seasonal adjustments of MR is still unknown, however. Therefore, in the study presented here we quantified for the first time the independent contribution of thermoregulation, LA and HI to heart rate (f(H)) as a measure of MR in a free-roaming large ungulate, the Przewalski horse or Takhi (Equus ferus przewalskii Poljakow). fH varied periodically throughout the year with a twofold increase from a mean of 44 beats min(-1) during December and January to a spring peak of 89 beats min(-1) at the beginning of May. LA increased from 23% per day during December and January to a mean level of 53% per day during May, and declined again thereafter. Daily mean subcutaneous body temperature (T-s) declined continuously during winter and reached a nadir at the beginning of April (annual range was 5.8 degrees C), well after the annual low of air temperature and LA. Lower T-s during winter contributed considerably to the reduction in f(H). In addition to thermoregulation, f(H) was affected by reproduction, LA, HI and unexplained seasonal variation, presumably reflecting to some degree changes in organ mass. The observed phase relations of seasonal changes indicate that energy expenditure was not a consequence of energy uptake but is under endogenous control, preparing the organism well in advance of seasonal energetic demands.",,,,,"Arnold, Walter/C-3394-2013","Arnold, Walter/0000-0001-6785-5685; Ruf, Thomas/0000-0002-9235-7079",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,NOV 15,2006,209,22,,,,,4566,4573,,10.1242/jeb.02536,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.02536,,,,,,,,17079726,,,,,WOS:000242132800021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our model is temperature-compensated and can be entrained to temperature cycles of various length and amplitude. The range of periods that allow entrainment of the model depends on the shape of the temperature cycles and is larger for sinusoidal compared to rectangular temperature curves.

One mechanism to confer associational resistance is believed to be exposure to neighbour-emitted volatiles, the receivers of which range from intra-and interspecific neighbour plants to higher-trophic-level insects. In previous studies the passive adsorption of neighbouremitted semivolatiles has been reported, but little is known regarding the mechanisms and ecological consequences on the receiver plant and its associated biota. To utilize volatile-based associational resistance for agricultural applications, it is imperative to know its effectiveness under varying diurnal temperatures and whether herbivore natural enemies, providing biological control, are impacted. Mimicking varying diurnal temperatures in a laboratory set-up, we assessed how the tritrophic model system Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli)-Plutella xylostella (crucifer specialist herbivore)-Cotesia vestalis (endoparasitoid of P. xylostella) is influenced by exposure to the natural semivolatile emitter plant Rhododendron tomentosum Harmaja. Results: Rhododendron tomentosum-exposed B. oleracea was less susceptible to P. xylostella oviposition at both night-time (12 degrees C) and day-time (22 degrees C) temperatures and less favoured and damaged by P. xylostella larvae at 12 degrees C. Exposure did not interfere with indirect defence, i.e. attraction of the natural enemy C. vestalis on host-damaged, R. tomentosum-exposed B. oleracea under 22 degrees C, while there was a reduction in attraction (marginal preference towards host-damaged B. oleracea) under 12 degrees C. Conclusions: The ability of R. tomentosum exposure to render associational resistance against an agriculturally important Brassica herbivore P. xylostella without severely compromising the specialist parasitoid C. vestalis host location encourages further studies on the potential of using this naturally abundant plant for biocontrol. The generality of our finding on temperature as a potential regulating mechanism for the efficacy of semivolatile emitter-based associational resistance towards specialist pest larval damage should be further studied in natural and agricultural associations. Our study emphasizes the need to develop techniques to compare volatiles at the leaf versus air interface and associate their appearance and ecological role with times of activity and level of specialisation of herbivores and their natural enemies.",,,,,"Holopainen, Jarmo K./B-1656-2008","Holopainen, Jarmo K./0000-0001-5026-3245; , Mengistu/0000-0003-2612-9243; Himanen, Sari J/0000-0001-6831-7694",,,,,,,,,,,,,1472-6785,,,,,MAY 29,2015,15,,,,,,,,16,10.1186/s12898-015-0048-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12898-015-0048-6,,,,,,,,26022675,,,,,WOS:000355161800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thermal and hydrothermal time models propose that seed germination rates are proportional to the amount by which temperature and water potential exceed threshold values for these environmental factors. Hence, base temperature for seed germination is a fundamental biological parameter for the prediction of weed emergence. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to estimate base temperature in three weed species belonging to the Asteraceae family, predominant in conservation tillage fields in north-eastern Italy. The traditional method based on germination assays at constant temperatures was compared with a method based on assays at alternating temperatures. The latter might represent an alternative to the former for those species which do not germinate or only poorly under constant temperatures. Base temperature was estimated by regressing the reciprocal of the median germination time on temperature comparing two functions, a broken-stick and an exponential-type model. Both models showed good fit to all data in the whole temperature range and in almost all cases provided similar estimates of base temperature. The main result is that, for the weed species examined in this study, the use of alternating temperatures for base temperature estimation appears to be possible. However, further research is required to test if the use of germination assays performed at alternating temperatures can be a suitable method to estimate base temperature of species that have too low germination at constant temperatures.",,,,,,"MASIN, ROBERTA/0000-0003-0882-0532",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1737,1365-3180,,,,DEC,2017,57,6,,,,,390,398,,10.1111/wre.12270,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.12270,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000415696400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study quantifies temporal changes in soil respiration and their driving factors in grassland and arable soils located in Northern Germany. Field measurements at an arable site showed diurnal mean soil respiration rates between 67 and 99 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) with a hysteresis effect following changes in mean soil temperatures. Field soil respiration peaked in April at 5767 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1), while values below 300 mg CO2 m(-2) day(-1) were measured in wintertime. Laboratory incubations were carried out in dark open flow chambers at temperatures from 5 degrees C to 40 degrees C, with 5 degrees C intervals, and soil moisture was controlled at 30%, 50%, and 70% of full water holding capacity. Respiration rates were higher in grassland soils than in arable soils when the incubating temperature exceeded 15 degrees C. The respiration rate difference between them rose with increasing temperature. Monthly median values of incubated soil respiration rates ranged from 0 to 26.12 and 0 to 7.84 mu g CO2 g(-1) dry weight h(-1), respectively, in grassland and arable land. A shortage of available substrate leads to a temporal decline in soil respiration rates, as indicated by a decrease in dissolved organic carbon. Temporal Q(10) values decreased from about 4.0 to below 1.5 as temperatures increased in the field. Moreover, the results of our laboratory experiments confirmed that soil temperature is the main controlling factor for the Q(10) values. Within the temperature interval between 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C, Q(10) values were around 2 while the Q(10) values of arable soils were slightly lower compared to that of grassland soils.

First, the correlations are analyzed among five meteorological variables: daily average temperature, average relative humidity, sunshine hours, diurnal temperature range, and atmospheric pressure. The resulting weak linear correlation supports the classification under multiple views. Next, a similarity matrix/graph is constructed by combining the advantages of k-nearest-neighbor and sparse subspace representation. The blocking effect of the similarity matrix confirms the rationality of the classification. Then, we consider respectively the climate classification under a single view and multiple views.

The consistency rates are improved evidently in a multiple-view situation. Afterward, we propose a determining method for the number of clusters and make a sensitivity analysis on various parameters. Finally, we provide a further statistical analysis on the classification results and compare the consistency with another climate dataset. All experimental results show that the proposed classification method is feasible and effective in the climate zoning of China.",,,,,"yang, liu/GVU-8760-2022","Shi, Jiarong/0000-0002-4315-8655",,,,,,,,,,,,,0894-8755,1520-0442,,,,JAN,2020,33,1,,,,,243,262,,10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0718.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-18-0718.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000502069600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A MODEL FOR SIMULATING PANICLE DEVELOPMENT BASED ON DAILY PHOTOPERIOD AND TEMPERATURE,JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Under the hypothesis that environmental responses of ontogenetic development of rice are different before and after panicle initiation (PI), a model for simulating rice panicle development and heading date was synthesized. In this model, the values of the developmental index (DVI) which is a continuous variable representing rice development stage are defined to be 0 at the emergence, 1.0 at P1 and 2.0 at the heading, respectively. Under this defining condition of DVI, we determined, for each developmental phase before and after P1, the values of parameters of the equation giving the developmental rate (DVR) as a function of daily mean temperature and photoperiod, by using the Simplex method and rice phenology data. Field experiments on three cultivars of Nipponbare, Koshihikari and IR36, in Kyoto over four years using a range of sowing dates in each year, provided data for the parameter estimation and model validation. The values of parameters thus obtained suggested that DVR responses to temperature and photoperiod are different between the vegetative and reproductive development phases. The model explained dates of PI and heading of the three cultivars more accurately than the previous model, in which DVR responses to the environment were assumed to be unchanged before and after the PI. A close correspondence was observed between the DVI values calculated by the model and the morphological development stage of rice panicle, irrespective of environmental conditions and cultivars, suggesting that the model is applicable for the prediction of the panicle development from environmental conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0011-1848,,,,,MAR,1995,64,1,,,,,33,42,,10.1626/jcs.64.33,http://dx.doi.org/10.1626/jcs.64.33,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QM26400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The dendrometers used in these experiments measured only the dimensional changes of the woody cylinder (sap- and heartwood). Wood diameter was measured close to the ground and just below the living crown. After correction for thermal expansion of dendrometers and wood, diurnal variation of wood diameter ranged between 50 and 180 mum. Psychrometric measurements showed that xylem water potential varied in parallel to wood diameter. Diameter changes were always more pronounced at the higher stem position and exhibited a clear diurnal pattern. During the day, wood diameter decreased with increasing vapor pressure deficit and transpiration rate and with decreasing twig water potential. At night, the wood re-expanded but did not always reach the dimension of the previous day. Pre-dawn wood diam eter decreased during periods of soil drought, a process which rapidly stopped and reversed after rain events. On several days, oscillation in wood diameter was observed during the mid-day hours. The oscillation had a period of approximately 50 min and showed a phase shift between different stem heights. All observed patterns of wood shrinkage and expansion were consistent with the hypothesis that xylem water tension leads to an elastic contraction of xylem conduits. The results demonstrate that xylem diameter is more suitable than whole-stem diameter for monitoring changes in xylem water potential.",,,,,,"Hietz, Peter/0000-0002-0458-6593",,,,,,,,,,,,,0931-1890,,,,,MAY,2001,15,4,,,,,215,221,,10.1007/s004680100090,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004680100090,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000169064300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drought is projected to intensify throughout their range, potentially leading to increased fire severity as moisture is a key control on severity. We studied the effect of low fuel moisture content (FMC) on fire severity by using 2 x 2 mrain-out shelters prior to completing 19 experimental fires in two sites in Scotland (UK): a dry heath with thin organic soils and a raised bog with deep, saturated peat, both dominated by Calluna vulgaris. Reduced FMC of the moss and litter (M/L) layer at both sites, and the soil moisture of the dry heath, increased fire-induced consumption of the M/L layer and soil heating at both sites. Increase in fire severity was greater at the dry heath than at the raised bog, e.g. average maximum temperatures at the soil surface increased from 31 degrees C to 189 degrees C at the dry heath, but only from 10 degrees C to 15 degrees C at the raised bog. Substantial M/L layer consumption was observed when its FMC was below 150%. This led to larger seasonal and daily soil temperature fluctuation, particularly at the dry heath during warm months. The results suggest that low FMC following predicted changes in climate are likely to increase wildfire severity and that the impact on vegetation composition and carbon stores may be greater at heathlands than at peatlands. Managed burning aiming to minimise fire severity (e.g. ignition of the M/L layer and exposure to lethal temperatures of ericoid seeds) should be carried out when the FMC of the M/L layer is above 150% and the FMC of the soil is above 200-300%.

However, current online measurements and extraction models are limited because they do not account for power losses caused by inhomogeneous thermal performance of photovoltaic modules. Accordingly, this paper develops a coupled thermoeelectrical loss model to access the power generation, energy losses, and degradation rate of photovoltaic modules with inhomogeneous temperature under actual operating conditions. The experiments indicate that the temperature coefficient of power dissipation and efficiency for solar cells with uneven temperature distribution PV modules are within -0.68W/degrees C to -0.83 W/degrees C and -0.46%/degrees C to -5.81%/degrees C, respectively. Additionally, the relative error values for the maximum power range from -2.54% to 4.09%, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed model for predicting the power output behavior of operating PV modules with inhomogeneous temperature distributions. Furthermore, the daily performances of the modules indicate heat and electricity losses ranging from 0.245 kWh to 0.337 kWh, while the ratios of electrical energy dissipation to daily losses vary from 36% to 50%. To ensure the reliability of measuring degradation rates, the solar irradiance thresholds of PV module performance tests are nearly 632W/m(2), 781W/m(2), 875W/m(2), and 875W/m(2), respectively. Finally, for the long-term performance valuation, the levelized costs of electricity increase by approximately 0.011 CNY/kWh for every 5% reduction in annual power generation, and the PBP is extended by 4.81yr, 4.22yr, 3.62yr, and 7.10yr, respectively.

Time of flowering is mainly influenced by genotype, temperature and photoperiod. Field experiments were carried out at Foggia (southern Italy) during successive growing seasons (from 8 to 16 growing cycles according to species) to study the relation among air temperature, photoperiod and duration of the morphological development of flowering in eight forage legume species: sulla (Hedysarum coronarium L.), sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.). pea (Pisum sativun L.), berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth). Time to reach 10% flowering (EF) and 100% flowering (FF) were recorded. Rate of progress to flowering, defined as the inverse of time from sowing to EF and FF, was related to mean daily temperature, or to both mean daily temperature and mean photoperiod. Using the linear equations, the thermal time requirements (T-t) and the base temperature (T-b) expressed as heat units were determined by the x-intercept method for both EF and FF stages. Evaluation of flowering time was also based on days after planting (DAP), day of year (DOY) and on a photothermal index (PTI). For all species, a significant negative correlation (P >= 0.01) was found between planting date (PD) and DAP whereas PTI showed a significant negative relationship (P >= 0.05) only for faba bean, pea, berseem clover and common vetch. In sainfoin, sulla and berseem clover, the rate of progress to flowering was affected significantly (P >= 0.05) by both mean temperature and photoperiod. The T-t requirements to reach the EF and the FF stage ranged from 871 to 1665 degrees C day and from 1043 to 1616 degrees C day, respectively, for the studied species. Both phenological stages considered depended upon accumulated thermal time above a species-specific base temperature. Furthermore, in all legumes the onset of flowering only occurred when dual thresholds of a minimum T-t and a minimum photoperiod were reached, which were specific to each species.

Methods: Eight Hanwoo heifers (20 to 32 month) were examined in a field trial, with a space allowance of 10 m(2) per head. The BST was measured using an infrared thermographic camera. The BST of five body regions (eyes, hindquarters, nose, part of horns, and ears), ambient temperature (AT), and relative humidity (RH) were measured 7 times daily (07, 09, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 h) during each season with three replicates. Results: The THI ranged 34.0 to 56.9 during spring (AT, -1.0 degrees C to 13.4 degrees C), 75.1 to 84.7 during summer (AT, 24.9 degrees C to 33.6 degrees C), 55.8 to 70.9 during autumn (AT, 13.0 degrees C to 26.0 degrees C) and 17.5 to 39.2 during winter (AT, -10.4 degrees C to 1.0 degrees C).

This cycling may contain important information regarding the ecosystem's functioning and, if property interpreted, can represent a valuable predictive tool in ecosystems management. This paper describes a simple algorithm for extracting meaningful information from daily cycles using fuzzy pattern recognition techniques. The algorithm is organised in three parts: in the first, typical patterns are extracted front experimental data to form the knowledge-base upon which the algorithm operates. The second step is to condense the information contained in the knowledge-base into mathematical objects, referred to in the paper as fuzzy masks. The third step is the Set-Lip of an inferential set of fuzzy rules, using the fuzzy masks as antecedents. Depending on how the inference engine is structured, the algorithm Output can be viewed as an assessment of the current daily cycle with respect to a set of typical system behaviours and decisions can be made accordingly. Two applications are presented to demonstrate the algorithm. In the first a medium-scale wastewater treatment plant with minimum instrumentation is considered. Based on diurnal flow variations of the last 2 days. the algorithm determines the current treatment level in terms of sludge recycling. The other application is the prediction of the eutrophication level in a coastal lagoon. In this case, the algorithm considers the diurnal fluctuations of basic water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, pH and temperature to detect the possibility of a macroalgae bloom. In both cases. the algrithm provides information about the shift of the system from one trend to another on the basis of the analysis of diurnal cycles.

While some of the results are new for the stratosphere, such comprehensive results for the mesosphere and lower thermosphere have not been available before. The diurnal variations generally become increasingly significant from the upper stratosphere into the lower thermosphere and provide information on the photochemistry of ozone and effects of transport over a diurnal cycle.

Outside of a small altitude near 80 km, the nighttime mixing ratios are generally larger than the daytime values. The diurnal variations themselves appear to exhibit variations over an annual cycle, including semiannual and annual variations. We compare the SABER results with data obtained about 10 years earlier by the MLS instrument on UARS, and with results by others based on data from HRDI on UARS, from the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME), from selected space shuttle experiments, and from ground-based measurements. From the middle mesosphere to higher altitudes, departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) can be significant, and the uncertainties can be larger than those at lower altitudes.",,,,,"Mlynczak, Martin/K-3396-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9380,2169-9402,,,,APR 24,2008,113,A4,,,,,,,A04307,10.1029/2007JA012739,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007JA012739,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000255461800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Jame, YW; Cutforth, HW",,,,"Jame, YW; Cutforth, HW",,,Simulating the effects of temperature and seeding depth on germination and emergence of spring wheat,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Numerous models using constant thermal time have been used to predict the time required from seeding to emergence of spring wheat (Triticuin aestivum L.). However, several researchers have questioned the theoretical validity of the assumption that the daily development rate is a linear function of temperature. In reality, the response of plant development rate to temperature is curvilinear. We developed a model to simulate seedling emergence of wheat using a nonlinear beta function to describe the developmental rate-temperature relationships over the full range of temperature (0-42 degreesC) for plant development. Three consecutive processes, i.e., germination, subcrown internode elongation, and coleoptile elongation, are involved during the period from seeding to seedling emergence. We considered each of these processes separately when simulating the combined effect of temperature and seeding depth on seedling emergence. Several well-defined data sets that are available in the literature were used to derive the model parameters. The model was independently tested with observed data obtained from controlled environments and from field experiments. Although the model described the full range of temperature, it was tested for the range from 0 to about 30degreesC. Model predictions of the time required for seedling emergence agreed reasonably well with the observed times, although the model preformed better at higher than at lower temperatures. The root mean square error of the model prediction was about 2 days. All model parameters can be readily determined for a given cultivar from well-defined experiments conducted in controlled environments. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Annual trends of BC and OC show strong seasonality with lower and higher concentrations during wet and dry seasons, respectively. Flow of cleaner air, wet removal, and negligible biomass burning resulted in the lowest concentrations of aerosols in the wet season. In addition to anthropogenic sources, long-range transport and biomass burning caused higher concentrations in the dry and hot seasons, respectively. Despite extensive biomass burning in the hot season, moderate levels of aerosols were due to the mixing with air masses from the Pacific Ocean. Diurnal distributions exhibit peaks during rush hour marked by minima in the OC/BC ratio and stagnant wind flow. The lowest concentrations in the afternoon hours could be due to deeper planetary boundary layer and reduced traffic. Overall, the concentrations of both BC and OC decrease with the increase in wind speed. The weekend effects, due to reduced emission during weekends, in the concentrations of both BC and OC were significant. Therefore, stricter abatement in vehicular emissions could substantially reduce pollution. A slope of Delta BC/Delta CO of 9.8 ngm(-3) ppbv(-1) for the wet season represents the emission ratio from vehicular sources. The highest of Delta OC/Delta BC (3 mu g mu g(-1)) in the hot season was due to the predominant influence of biomass burning and significant formation of secondary OC.

Elephant shrews are an ancient mammal order within a superordinal African clade including hyraxes, elephants, dugongs and the aardvark. M. proboscideus only employed torpor when deprived of food; torpor did not occur under an ad libitum diet at ambient temperatures of 10, 15 and 25 degrees C. Torpor bout duration ranged from <1 h to ca. is h. The times of entry into torpor were restricted to the scotophase, despite normothermic body temperature patterns indicating a rest phase coincident with the photophase. Full arousal was always achieved within the first 3 h of the photophase. When food deprived, the onset of the rest phase, and hence torpor, advanced with respect to the experimental photoperiod. The lowest torpor body temperature measured was 9.41 degrees C. Daily torpor in M. proboscideus confirms a pleisiomorphic origin of daily heterothermy. Torpor facilitates risk-averse foraging behaviour in these small omnivores by overcoming long-term energy shortfalls generated by the inherent variability of food availability in their semiarid, El Nino-afflicted habitats.",,,,,"Lovegrove, Barry G/D-1320-2009; Lawes, Michael J/N-2132-2013","Lawes, Michael J/0000-0002-2381-6147",,,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,,,,,OCT,1999,169,7,,,,,453,460,,10.1007/s003600050242,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003600050242,,,,,,,,10595314,,,,,WOS:000083622300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although a correlation is indisputable, there is at present hardly evidence for a causal involvement of sleep in changes in body temperature. Concerning the reverse, a causal involvement of body temperature in sleep has been demonstrated: if core or skin temperature changes activate thermoregulatory processes aimed at heat loss or heat preservation, sleep is usually disrupted. We have recently proposed that sleep propensity is also affected by more subtle changes in skin temperature, within the thermoneutral range (Van Someren (2000). Chronobiol. Int. 17, 313-354). These changes are likely to modulate the firing properties of thermosensitive neurons in brain areas involved in sleep regulation. Subtle changes in skin temperature occur daily under control of the circadian timing system. They could provide this system with an additional signal pathway to support its neuronal and neurohormonal signals to enforce circadian modulation of sleep propensity. Subtle changes in skin temperature also result from behavior, and could contribute to the changes in sleep propensity resulting from these behaviors. The present review summarizes the neurobiological background and correlational physiological and behavioral data in support of the involvement of skin temperature in the modulation of sleep propensity. It moreover points out the type of experimental investigations needed to support or refute the hypothesis.

Land surfaces can present varying degrees of inertia to atmospheric forcing variability (e.g., precipitation). This study asks: are regions with the most variable environmental forcing necessarily the regions with the largest land surface variability? Specifically, it seeks to determine why land surfaces show varying responsiveness to environmental forcing. The degree to which and the mechanisms for how landscapes modulate the forcing are evaluated using a decade-long satellite observation record of Africa's diverse climates. Surface responsiveness is quantified using intra-seasonal energy flux variability, based on the observed diurnal temperature amplitude. We map the responsiveness and analyze the underlying mechanisms over intra-seasonal timescales (especially interstorms). We show that, at a location, land surface responsiveness is dependent on the soil moisture distribution and the nonlinear relationship between energy fluxes and soil moisture. Land surfaces with greater responsiveness to climate are those with soil moisture distributions that span the threshold between evaporation regimes and spend most of their time in the water-limited regime. Consequently, surface responsiveness mechanisms drive land surface variability beyond high climatic variability. Since we find these results to hold from intra-seasonal to interannual timescales, we expect that these responsive regions will be most vulnerable to long-term shifts in climate forcing. The quantification of these phenomena and determination of their geographic distributions based on observations can help assess land surface models used to evaluate hydrologic consequences of climate change.",,,,,"Trigo, Isabel/H-1630-2011; Gianotti, Daniel/K-5606-2013","Trigo, Isabel/0000-0001-8640-9170; Feldman, Andrew/0000-0003-1547-6995; Gianotti, Daniel/0000-0003-4891-2474; Entekhabi, Dara/0000-0002-8362-4761",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,JAN,2022,58,1,,,,,,,e2021WR030316,10.1029/2021WR030316,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR030316,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000751310200054,View Full Record in Web of Science

This showed that a wide daily range of temperature, rather than the absolute value of the temperature, is associated with the occurrence of RRD.Purpose. To investigate the association between the frequency of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) and the atmospheric temperature.Method. A retrospective review of consecutive eyes that had undergone primary RRD surgery from 1996 to 2016 at Chungbuk National University Hospital was conducted. Temperature data (highest, lowest, and mean daily temperatures and daily temperature range) in Chungbuk Province were obtained from the Korean Meteorological Administration database.

We also analyzed the association between various temperature data and the frequency of RRD surgery.Result. There were 1,394 RRD surgeries from 1996 to 2016. Among them, 974 eyes were included in this study. The monthly average number of RRD operations showed a bimodal peak (in April and October) throughout the year. With the same tendency as the frequency of RRD, the monthly average of the daily temperature range over 1 year also showed a bimodal peak in April and October. There was a significant positive correlation between the monthly average of the daily temperature range and the number of RRD surgeries (r = 0.297,P<0.001). However, there were no associations between RRD frequency and the mean temperature, highest temperature, and lowest temperature.Conclusion. The higher the daily temperature range, the higher was the RRD frequency observed.

We explored the effects of daily mean temperatures in the 12-40 degreesC range during the embryo growth phase on embryo growth characteristics in cv. HA89 by growing plants in temperature-controlled glasshouse modules between the start of linear embryo growth and physiological maturity. Grain was harvested at regular intervals during the growth period and rates and durations of embryo growth derived from bi-phasic linear regression models fitted to the resulting embryo weight dynamics data. Embryo filling duration showed a curvilinear response to temperature with a minimum close to 34 degreesC. In contrast, the curvilinear response of rate of embryo filling peaked at 25 degreesC. The opposing effects of these two responses produced a continuously decreasing embryo size with temperature (P < 0.0001) (average decrease 1.2% per <degrees>C) over much of the temperature range explored. A plot of the inverse of embryo growth duration against temperature served to estimate base and optimum temperatures of -1 and 34 degreesC, respectively.

The 30-year simulations are compared with the available surface station data, focusing on near-surface air temperature and precipitation. The analysis has shown that the model overestimates the diurnal temperature variation during the cold period of the year (DJF) in the majority of the stations. During the warm period (JJA) the simulated daily temperature range is shifted towards warmer values, while during the transient periods of the year (MAM and SON) it is shifted towards cooler values. Both usual goodness of fit indices and tests and some more advanced methods for comparing statistical distributions were used. The latter indicate that both a scale and location adjustment needs to be applied on the model results distribution in order to sufficiently describe the observed temperature distribution. Regarding rainfall, it was found that the model underestimates the seasonal rainfall during DJF and SON, mainly over the stations of the Mediterranean coast that receive most of the yearly rainfall during autumn and, mainly, winter. An interesting feature is that, during JJA, the model was able to reproduce quite efficiently the seasonal rainfall in the central Balkans that receive as much rain during summer as during winter.

Daily ETc forecasts of irrigated double-cropping rice were determined for three growing seasons during the period of 2013-2015 and were compared with ETc values measured by the weighing lysimeters at the Jiangxi experimental irrigation station in southeastern China. During the early rice season, the average mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values of ETc forecasts ranged from 0.95 to 1.06 mm day(-1) and from 1.18 to 1.31 mm day(-1), respectively, and the average correlation coefficient (R) ranged from 0.39 to 0.54; for late rice, the average MAE and RMSE values ranged from 1.01 to 1.09 mm day(-1) and from 1.32 to 1.40 mm day(-1), respectively, and the average R value ranged from 0.54 to 0.58. There could be three factors responsible for errors in ETc forecasts, including temperature forecast errors, K-c value errors and neglected meteorological variables in the HS model, including wind speed and relative humidity.

The oscillations with a period of about 30 to 60 minutes were recorded in the air temperature course taken from 11 am to 5 pm. At the height of 200 cm oscillations ranged from 24 to 28 degrees C. Concurrently, in the depth of 15 cm, the oscillations of tensiometric pressure in the range of -6 to -11 kPa were recorded from 8 am to 4 pm. It was concluded that the oscillations in the air temperature resulted from autonomous and self-regulated oscillations in the intensity of transpiration. It is evident that the 2-m air temperature was significantly influenced by transpiration of plants around the large area. The fact that the air temperature oscillated sharply confirms that the rate of transpiration was synchronized in this area. Vegetative cover thus created a self-regulated superorganism that substantially affected the temperature of the near-ground atmosphere layer.",,,,,"Šír, Miloslav/H-2133-2018; Tesar, Miroslav/G-1568-2011; Lichner, Lubomir/S-1376-2019","Tesar, Miroslav/0000-0002-5647-8498; Lichner, Lubomir/0000-0001-6057-1903",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3088,1336-9563,,,,NOV,2014,69,11,,,,,1570,1576,,10.2478/s11756-014-0469-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-014-0469-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000346177900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, very little is known about the suitability of measurements made in constant environments to predict the level of adaptation to rapidly fluctuating environments. To explore this question, we used bacterial clones adapted to constant or fluctuating temperatures and found that measurements across a range of constant temperatures did not indicate any adaptation to fluctuating temperatures. However, adaptation to fluctuating temperatures was only apparent if growth was measured during thermal fluctuation. Thus, tolerance curves based on measurements in constant environments can be misleading in predicting the ability to tolerate fast environmental fluctuations. Such complications could lead to false estimates of the genetic merits of genotypes and extinction risks of species due to climate change-induced thermal fluctuations.",,,,,"Ketola, Tarmo/AAD-2609-2019","Ketola, Tarmo/0000-0001-5151-7980",,,,,,,,,,,,,1010-061X,1420-9101,,,,APR,2015,28,4,,,,,800,806,,10.1111/jeb.12606,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jeb.12606,,,,,,,,25704064,,,,,WOS:000353295200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experimental phase lasted for one year and daily mean room temperature showed a difference of 2-16 degrees C between winter (Dec-Feb), spring (Mar-May), summer (Jun-Aug) and autumn (Sep-Nov) periods. The results showed that variation in ambient temperature had a significant effect on chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) reduction, indicator organisms and pathogen removal, earthworm population, bacterial and actinomycetes number, but had no effect on total suspended solids (TSS) removal and fungi number. The study showed that higher BOD and COD removal was accomplished during the spring and autumn period when the mean temperature was 25-27 degrees C. This temperature range is optimum for the earthworm species Eisenia fetida for its activity, growth and reproduction and any variation in temperature from the optimum range led to decrease in treatment efficiency and earthworm population. However, during summer, when the maximum temperature reached 38-40 degrees C, the indicator bacteria removal was maximum by 99.9%, Salmonella reduction by 96.9% and Escherichia coli by 99.3%. The pathogen removal efficacy of VF increases with the increase in temperature, as shown by linear regression analysis, which implied that temperature had a significant contribution to the pathogen removal efficiency of VF. Pearson coefficient of correlation (r) derived an important relationship between the seasonal temperature and treatment efficiency, pathogen removal efficacy and microbial numbers during vermifiltration.

Experimental and numerical studies were conducted on two isolated cast-in-place energy piles installed in dense unsaturated sand, one exposed to the atmosphere at the ground surface (diameter = 0.6 m and length = 16.1 m) and the other installed under a six-story building (diameter = 0.6 m and length = 10 m). Investigations were conducted for monotonic heating and daily cyclic temperature changes of the piles ranging between 10 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The changes in ground temperature decreased as radial distance increased from the edge of both piles. Cyclic temperatures in both piles induced lower ground temperature changes and decreased the radial thermal influence zone compared with monotonic heating. However, the radial thermal zone in cyclic operating mode can be influenced by different ratios of heating to cooling times and hence should be selected carefully to avoid unexpected ground temperature changes. Atmospheric effects were observed up to a depth of 2 m for the energy pile exposed to the atmosphere. The insulation provided by the building footprint slightly decreased the impacts of ground-atmosphere interaction on the soil temperature distribution with depth near the surface compared to the energy pile exposed to the atmosphere. The ground temperature variations were dominant along the length of the heat exchanger loops for both piles. However, they were negligible near the pile toe below the heat exchanger loops for both piles.

However, few studies have investigated the effect of higher temperature on tropical crops. We therefore performed an experiment with a tropical crop of Habanero pepper (Capsicum Chinense Jacq.). Three growth chambers were used, each with 30 Habanero pepper plants. Chambers were maintained at a diurnal maximum air temperature (DMT) of 30 (chamber 1), 35 (chamber 2) and 40 degrees C (chamber 3). Each contained plants from seedling to fruiting stage. Physiological response to variation in DMT was evaluated for each stage over the course of five months. The results showed that both leaf area and dry mass of Habanero pepper plants did not exhibit significant differences in juvenile and flowering phenophases. However, in the fruiting stage, the leaf area and dry mass of plants grown at 40 degrees C DMT were 51 and 58% lower than plants at 30 degrees C DMT respectively. Meanwhile, an increase in diurnal air temperature raised both stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, causing an increase in temperature deficit (air temperature - leaf temperature). Thus, leaf temperature decreased by 5 degrees C, allowing a higher CO2 assimilation rate in plants at diurnal maximum air temperature (40 degrees C). However, in CO2 measurements when leaf temperature was set at 40 degrees C, physiological parameters decreased due to an increase in stomatal limitation. We conclude that the thermal optimum range in a tropical crop such as Habanero pepper is between 30 and 35 degrees C (leaf temperature, not air temperature). In this range, gas exchange through stomata is probably optimal. Also, the air temperature-leaf temperature relationship helps to explain how temperature keeps the major physiological processes of Habanero pepper healthy under experimental conditions.",,,,,"Canto, Azucena/ABD-3097-2020","Canto, Azucena/0000-0002-0712-2241; LARQUE SAAVEDRA, ALFONSO/0000-0001-9462-5682",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,NOV 3,2014,9,11,,,,,,,e111402,10.1371/journal.pone.0111402,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111402,,,,,,,,25365043,,,,,WOS:000345558100064,View Full Record in Web of Science

New York, a major U.S. tributary of Lake Ontario. Evacuation rate, estimated as a function of temperature in controlled laboratory experiments, ranged from 0.214/h at 10 degrees C to 0.352/h at 19 degrees C. Diet field sampling for daily ration estimates occurred on three dates in late spring (June 6, 12, and 18, 200 1). Although no consistent diel feeding pattern was observed, Chinook salmon maintained an elevated gut fullness value throughout the day and did not feed after dark. Moreover, daily rations (grams [dry weight] of ration per 100 g of dry fish weight), which ranged from 27.54 (SE = 3.07) on June 12 to 33.27 (3.7) on June 6, were high compared with the values obtained in similar studies. Comparisons of daily ration estimates with bioenergetics model estimates showed that juvenile Chinook salmon were consuming prey at or above their maximum estimated daily ration. Daily ring counts of sagittal otoliths confirmed that the Chinook salmon in this investigation were naturally produced.

It has the advantages of non-invasiveness, high sensitivity and deep penetration depth, which is suitable for monitoring the temperature distribution for the safe deposition of heat energy and efficient destruction of tumor cells during thermotherapy or cryotherapy. However, the present reported methods usually use one single wavelength for photoacoustic temperature measuring and are vulnerable to systematic and environmental influence, including the instability of system caused by fluctuation of laser energy, position displacement of transducer, and tissue complexity, which could reduce the measuring accuracy and stability. To solve this problem, a new photoacoustic temperature measuring method by employing two laser wavelengths is proposed in this paper. Firstly a brief theoretical analysis of dual-wavelengths photoacoustic temperature method is performed based on the linear relationship between photoacoustic signal and tissue temperature under two different wavelengths. Then two different samples including phantom of graphite and ex vivo pig blood are experimented respectively. The experimental temperature is set to be in a range of 26 degrees C-48 degrees C, which is controlled by a precise hot plate. And for improving the detection accuracy, the dual-wavelengths are selected as 760 and 900 nm for graphite phantom, 820 nm and 860 nm for ex vivo pig blood according to their absorption spectrum repetitively. The obtained results reveal that the temperature measuring correlation coefficients by dual-wavelength method can reach to 0.98 in graphite phantom and 0.99 in ex vivo tissue, respectively. And the average measurement deviation decreases to 0.88 degrees C in dual-wavelength method from 1.31 degrees C for the traditional single wavelength method for graphite phantom. While in ex vivo tissue, the measurement deviation decreases to 0.90 degrees C in dual-wavelength method from the average value 1.45 degrees C for the single wavelength method. Furthermore, the standard deviations of error are respectively reduced by an average of 38% in graphite phantom and an average of 30% in ex vivo tissue, respectively. These results indicate that the dual-wavelength method of photoacoustic temperature measurement can improve both the measuring accuracy and stability, and has a potential to be applied to medical therapy and other biomedical fields.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-3290,,,,,JUN 5,2017,66,11,,,,,,,117802,10.7498/aps.66.117802,http://dx.doi.org/10.7498/aps.66.117802,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000403091100035,View Full Record in Web of Science

Meanwhile, the temperature distribution along the channel under rolling motion conditions is predicted based on a self-developed code. The results show that the cycle averaged liquid temperature at the outlet of the test section under rolling motion conditions is higher than that under vertical conditions. The waveform of fluctuations in fluid temperature is complex and deviates from the standard sine curve, which is the law of the rolling platform. In the single-phase natural circulation loop, temperature fluctuations at the outlet of the test section are spurred from flow rate fluctuations caused by rolling motion in a dominant manner. Instantaneous temperature fluctuations are successfully predicted from the self-developed code for the single-phase natural circulation loop of a heated narrow rectangular channel under rolling motion conditions. Under rolling motion and constant heat flux conditions, the amplitude of temperature fluctuations in the heated zone increases along the flow direction. Along the flow direction, phases of the temperature crest at different locations of the heated zone exhibit a lag effect. In the adiabatic section between the outlets of the heated zone and test section, the amplitude of temperature fluctuations decreases, and the waveform is smoothed along the flow direction. Moreover, the instantaneous temperature distribution in the heated zone is approximately linear along the flow direction when the flow rate remains positive during rolling motion.

The compensation is realized by using a temperature sensor independent of the flow sensor into a single Wheatstone-bridge circuit of the anemometer and adopting a novel design approach to the resistors of the bridge for balancing out the temperature drift. The temperature sensor does not have to possess an equal temperature coefficient of resistance to that of the flow sensor. The temperature compensation in a dynamic measurement does not affect the measurement of velocity fluctuations when the temperature fluctuations are of lower frequencies than the bandwidth of the temperature sensor.

Results showed that the error of the anemometer induced by the temperature variation could be effectively eliminated from 30% to 2% over a range of ambient temperatures (30-60 degrees C) using the proposed compensation method.",,,,,"yang, zhaoxin/G-6950-2011","Que, Ruiyi/0000-0003-2924-9400",,,,,,,,,,,,,0957-0233,1361-6501,,,,AUG,2011,22,8,,,,,,,85404,10.1088/0957-0233/22/8/085404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0957-0233/22/8/085404,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000292775000022,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the assumption of an emissivity constant is being used in Gobi broadband emissivity (GbBE) parameterization scheme in numerical models because of limited knowledge surrounding the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of GbBE. To address this issue, we analyzed the variation characteristics of GbBE and possible impact factor-surface soil moisture based on long-term continuous and high temporal resolution field observational experiments over a typical Gobi underlying surface in arid and semiarid areas in northwestern China. The results indicate that GbBE has obvious daily and diurnal variation features, especially diurnal cycle characteristics. The multi-year average of the daily average of GbBE is in the range of 0.932 to 0.970 with an average of 0.951 +/- 0.008, and the average diurnal GbBE is in the range of 0.880 to 0.940 with an average of 0.906 +/- 0.018. GbBE varies with surface soil moisture content. We observed a slight decrease in GbBE with an increase in soil moisture, although this change was not very obvious because of the low soil moisture in this area. Nevertheless, we think that soil moisture must be one of the most significant impact factors on GbBE in arid and semiarid areas. Soil moisture must be taken into account into the parameterization schemes of bare soil broadband emissivity in land surface models.

These were a) early winter (late pregnancy). (b) early spring (early lactation), (c) late spring (before mating at mid-lactation). (d) early summer (after mating at mid-lactation), (e) late summer (late lactation, early pregnancy) and, (f) early autumn (drying-off at the end of lactation, mid-pregnancy). Live weight and body condition score was recorded on the first day of each measurement period. Live weight differed (P<0.001) with breed with HF cows heaviest and J cows lightest (HF: 525 +/- 51, HF x J: 456 +/- 56. J: 401 +/- 30 kg). HF cows tended (P = 0.099) to have a higher body condition than either J or HF x J cows although the overall change in body condition during the experiment was similar (P = 0.961) amongst breeds. The circadian body temperature rhythm differed markedly between each measurement period, being flatter and having a less prominent morning nadir and afternoon peak during early winter compared to spring and summer. The timing of peak body temperature was 4-5 h earlier in early autumn in HF and HF x J cows relative to J cows. There was no breed difference (P >= 0.162) in daily mean body temperature except for a tendency (P=0.075) for mean body temperature to be moderately higher in J cows (38.5 degrees C during late summer compared to HF and HF x J cows (38.4 degrees C), primarily due to an increase (P= 0.001) in daily minimum body temperature (38.0 vs. 37.8 degrees C. The daily range of oscillation (maximum-minimum) in the body temperature rhythm was highest during late summer, particularly in HF and HF x J cows. Minimum body temperature was also higher (P = 0.033) for J cows than HF and HF x J cows during early autumn (37.9 vs. 37.8 degrees C). In conclusion, season and physiological status of cattle had a profound effect on the circadian body temperature rhythm but there was little difference between the breeds of dairy cows studied.

Here, we compare its potential as a biological control agent at high temperatures to that of Encarsia formosa (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), a wasp which is widely sold for control of T. vaporariorum. RESULTS Eretmocerus warrae attained the highest estimated developmental rate at 31.4 degrees C and the maximum oviposition rate at 30.5 degrees C. Developmental times of E. warrae at fluctuating temperatures that simulate night-day patterns were similar to those predicted based on constant temperatures. Above the optimum temperature, E. warrae tolerated higher constant temperatures than En. formosa during development and as adults. Using a ramping temperature approach, the critical thermal maximum for adult E. warrae was significantly higher than that of adult En. formosa. CONCLUSION Eretmocerus warrae is better adapted to high temperatures than En. formosa, and could therefore be a complementary or superior biological control agent during summer months in hot regions.

The focus of the analyses is a 10-day simulation that used the 10-day average of the global analysis at 0000 UTC as the initial condition and the 10-day averages every 6 h as lateral boundary conditions (with diurnal variations only). Despite differences in the rainfall intensity and location, this idealized experiment successfully simulated the observed diurnal variation and eastward propagation of rainfall and mesoscale convective vortices along the mei-yu front. It was found that the upward branch of the MPS, along with the attendant nocturnal low-level jet, is primarily responsible for the midnight-to-early-morning rainfall enhancement along the mei-yu front. The MPS is induced by differential heating between the high mountain ranges in central China and the low-lying plains in east China. Diabatic heating from moist convection initiated and/or enhanced by the solenoid circulation subsequently leads to the formation of a mesoscale convective vortex that further organizes and amplifies moist convection while propagating eastward along the mei-yu front. The downward branch of the MPS, on the other hand, leads to the suppression of precipitation over the plains during the daytime. The impacts of this regional MPS on the rainfall diurnal variations are further attested to by another idealized WRF simulation that uses fixed lateral boundary conditions.",,,,,"Zhang, Fuqing/E-6522-2010","Zhang, Fuqing/0000-0003-4860-9985",,,,,,,,,,,,,0027-0644,1520-0493,,,,FEB,2012,140,2,,,,,379,397,,10.1175/MWR-D-11-00041.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-11-00041.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000299850300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A.; Carazo, Pau",,,Temperature as a modulator of sexual selection,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,,,,,,,,,,,,"A central question in ecology and evolution is to understand why sexual selection varies so much in strength across taxa; it has long been known that ecological factors are crucial to this. Temperature is a particularly salient abiotic ecological factor that modulates a wide range of physiological, morphological and behavioural traits, impacting individuals and populations at a global taxonomic scale. Furthermore, temperature exhibits substantial temporal variation (e.g. daily, seasonally and inter-seasonally), and hence for most species in the wild sexual selection will regularly unfold in a dynamic thermal environment. Unfortunately, studies have so far almost completely neglected the role of temperature as a modulator of sexual selection. Here, we outline the main pathways through which temperature can affect the intensity and form (i.e. mechanisms) of sexual selection,via: (i) direct effects on secondary sexual traits and preferences (i.e. trait variance, opportunity for selection and trait-fitness covariance), and (ii) indirect effects on key mating parameters, sex-specific reproductive costs/benefits, trade-offs, demography and correlated abiotic factors. Building upon this framework, we show that, by focusing exclusively on the first-order effects that environmental temperature has on traits linked with individual fitness and population viability, current global warming studies may be ignoring eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated by sexual selection. Finally, we tested the general prediction that temperature modulates sexual selection by conducting a meta-analysis of available studies experimentally manipulating temperature and reporting effects on the variance of male/female reproductive success and/or traits under sexual selection. Our results show a clear association between temperature and sexual selection measures in both sexes. In short, we suggest that studying the feedback between temperature and sexual selection processes may be vital to developing a better understanding of variation in the strength of sexual selection in nature, and its consequences for population viability in response to environmental change (e.g. global warming).",,,,,"Garcia-Gonzalez, Francisco/A-3780-2008; Carazo, Pau/B-3311-2011","Garcia-Gonzalez, Francisco/0000-0001-9515-9038; Garcia-Roa, Roberto/0000-0002-9568-9191; Carazo, Pau/0000-0002-1525-6522",,,,,,,,,,,,,1464-7931,1469-185X,,,,DEC,2020,95,6,,,,,1607,1629,,10.1111/brv.12632,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12632,,JUL 2020,,,,,,32691483,,,,,WOS:000550400000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about the effects of snow cover and soil temperature on the overwintering pupae of H. armigera. A field experiment was conducted from November 2, 2012 to April 24, 2013 at the agrometeorological experimental station in Wulanwusu, China. Overwintering pupae were embedded into the soil at depths of 5, 10, and 15 cm in the following four treatments: without snow cover, snow cover, and increased temperatures from 600 and 1200 W infrared lights. The results showed that snow cover and rising temperatures could all markedly increase soil temperatures, which was helpful in improving the survival of the overwintering pupae of H. armigera. The mortality of overwintering pupae (MOP) at a depth of 15 cm was the highest, and the MOP at a depth of 5 cm followed. The lower accumulated temperature (a parts per thousand currency sign0 A degrees C) (AT a parts per thousand currency sign A degrees C) led to the higher MOP, and the lower diurnal soil temperature range (DSTR) likely led to the lower MOP. After snowmelt, the MOPs at the depths of 5 and 10 cm increased as the soil temperature increased, especially in April. The AT of the soil (a parts per thousand currency sign0 A degrees C) was the factor with the strongest effect on MOP. The soil moisture content was not a major factor affecting the MOP in this semiarid region because precipitation was 45 mm over the entire experimental period. With climate warming, the MOP will likely decrease, and the overwintering boundary air temperatures of H. armigera should be expanded due to higher soil temperatures and increased snow cover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0020-7128,1432-1254,,,,JUL,2016,60,7,,,,,977,989,,10.1007/s00484-015-1090-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-015-1090-y,,,,,,,,26514355,,,,,WOS:000379262800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The times to intermediate stages (III-V) and total hatching, obtained in this study, agree with the results of previous studies undertaken some years ago. However, the times over stages IA, IB and 50% hatching indicate that development rates differed significantly between the studies; this could be related to an effect of the previous thermal history of the eggs, or to experimental biases. Daily mortality (Z) during the embryonic period was found to vary between 0.17 and 0.38, using traditional exponential decay models. The estimates of mortality rate were found to range consistently with those derived from previous studies on Northwest Atlantic mackerel eggs without predation. However, the shape of the survivorship-curve during the development pursued in this study has indicated that mortality is not constant in time.

Although the rate of heat acclimatization has received some study, little is known about how long these adaptive changes remain without continuing exposure to heat stress. This study explored the rate at which field acclimatization states are lost when temperature variability is minimized during constant submersion. California mussels (Mytilus califomianus) with different acclimatization states were collected from high- and low-zone sites (similar to 12 versus similar to 5 degrees C daily temperature ranges, respectively) and then kept submerged at 15 degrees C for 8 weeks. Each week, the cardiac thermal performance of mussels was measured as a metric of acclimatization state: critical (T-crit) and flatline (T-flat) temperatures were recorded. Over 8 weeks of constant submersion, the mean T(crit )of high-zone mussels decreased by 1.07 degrees C from baseline, but low-zone mussels' mean T-crit was unchanged. High- and low-zone mussels' mean maximum heart rate (HR) and resting HR decreased similar to 12 and 35%, respectively. T-flat was unchanged in both groups. These data suggest that T-crit and HR are more physiologically plastic in response to the narrowing of an animal's daily temperature range than T(flat )is, and that an animal's prior acclimatization state (high versus low) influences the acdimatory capacity of T-crit . Approximately 2 months were required for the cardiac thermal performance of the high-zone mussels to reach that of the low-zone mussels, suggesting that acclimatization to high and variable temperatures may persist long enough to enable these animals to cope with intermittent bouts of heat stress.",,,,,,"Somero, George/0000-0003-1431-6455; Moyen, Nicole/0000-0002-5311-0532; Denny, Mark/0000-0003-0277-9022",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUL,2020,223,13,,,,,,,jeb222893,10.1242/jeb.222893,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.222893,,,,,,,,32457061,,,,,WOS:000576693100018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The bromeliad Nidularium minutum Mez is a cold tolerant species from the Atlantic Rainforest, which grows in the subtropical latitude, where temperatures range from 2 to 30 degrees C. We hypothesized that N. minutum plants would implement rapid metabolic adjustments to ensure survival during sudden cold events that occur in seasons other than winter. N. minutum plants were cultivated at 10 degrees C. Under this condition, there was an observed increase in soluble sugar content and nitric oxide (NO) emission, as well as a high nitrate reductase (NR) activity observed within the 72 h of cold exposure, when compared with plants maintained at 25 degrees C. These responses coincided with a decrease in antioxidant activity and an increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO). After 72 h of cold exposure, a subset of plants were de-acclimated at 25 degrees C. These plants displayed reduced soluble sugar concentrations, NO emissions, NR activity and LPO. Additionally, there was an increase in anti-oxidant activity, which indicated that the plants were recovering from cold stress. Furthermore, it was found that plants maintained at 10 degrees C for 168 h acclimated to the cold by reducing the NO content and maintaining the increased sugar concentrations, thus resulting in a less intense stress response. We conclude that rapid changes in NO content, sugar concentrations and antioxidant activity are metabolic adjustments that occur during the acclimation and de-acclimation processes of this bromeliad to low temperatures.

Both half zone (Ma approximate to 1-1.5.10(4)) and full zone (Ma approximate to 1.5-3.5.10(3)) arrangements have been investigated. In case of the latter one, temperature measurements have been performed during the growth process to analyze the relation between the temperature fluctuations and the dopant distribution. All experiments have been carried out in monoellipsoid mirror furnaces. For temperature measurements, sheathed thermocouples or graphite-coated blackbody sensors (material: fused quartz, diameter of active tip less than or equal to 300 mu m) have been used. The maximum temperature fluctuations were up to 7K in the half-zone case and 0.7K in the full-zone one. In both cases the main frequencies are in the range of 0.05 to 0.5Hz but they are slightly shifted to higher values with increasing Marangoni number. For the half-zone configuration, four thermocouples and up to two black-body sensors were inserted into the melt. Between certain pairs of thermocouples and sensors, a well developed phase correlation or 180 degrees anti-phase correlation has been detected indicating a pulsating flow regime. In the case of the floating zone experiments, a very good agreement is found between the frequency characteristic of the temperature signal and the frequency distribution of dopant irregularities.",,,,,"Croell, Arne Richard/A-2480-2013","Croell, Arne Richard/0000-0002-8673-9994",,,,,,,,,,,,,0277-786X,,0-8194-3278-4,,,,1999,3792,,,,,,314,322,,10.1117/12.351291,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.351291,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081827700032,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a result, growers are exploring approaches to protect berries from excessive temperatures, however, they can be costly and time-consuming to experimentally evaluate, and results may not be generalizable. In this work, we developed and evaluated a new 3-D model that can predict metrics related to berry temperature and light interception in response to varying vineyard architecture, topography, and shade cloth density. The resulting modeling tool was applied to better understand and evaluate a range of potential vineyard design and management practices for mitigation of elevated berry temperatures in vertically trained grapevines. Model validation showed close agreement between predicted and measured temperature dynamics, which responded appropriately to the application of shade cloth. In a simulation experiment, row spacing, row orientation, slope grade and aspect, and shade cloth density were varied to evaluate their effect on berry and canopy light intercep-tion, berry temperature spikes, and integrated berry heat accumulation. On flat terrain, a northeast-southwest row orientation provided the best compromise of berry light and temperature balance between opposing vine faces while avoiding excessive berry temperatures, while north-south rows provided good daily symmetry but had risk of high afternoon berry temperatures. The efficacy of shade cloth in mitigating excessive temperatures depended strongly on all variables considered. Slopes with southern or western exposure increased the imbalance in and risk of high berry temperatures, which in some cases could not be well-managed by shade cloth. Overall, the modeling tool appears capable of providing quantitative guidance for vineyard design and management where excessive berry temperatures are of concern.",,,,,"Ponce de León, María Alejandra/AHB-7623-2022","Ponce de León, María Alejandra/0000-0002-4675-1673",,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9254,1943-7749,,,,JUL 1,2022,73,3,,,,,175,189,,10.5344/ajev.2022.21054,http://dx.doi.org/10.5344/ajev.2022.21054,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000828786900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Motivated by these experiments, we investigate theoretically the electronic energy and temperature fluctuations in a metallic island in the Coulomb blockade regime, tunnel coupled to an electronic reservoir, i.e. a single electron box. We show that electronic quantum tunnelling between the island and the reservoir, in the absence of any net charge or energy transport, induces fluctuations of the island electron temperature. The full distribution of the energy transfer as well as the island temperature is derived within the framework of full counting statistics.

A portion of statolith precipitated during the experiment was optically identified by daily increment analysis, and then subjected to Sr/Ca measurement using an electron probe micro-analyser.

For one thing, the amount of radiation received by the pyrometer increases. On the other hand, the surface emissivity model may change. So a large temperature measurement error may occur. In order to accurately measure the true surface temperature of an object in a high temperature environment, a multi-spectral temperature measurement method based on adaptive emissivity model is proposed in this paper. First, BP neural network is used to identify the shape of spectral data and obtain the correspondence between spectral data and emissivity model, then output the emissivity model that conforms to the measured target and specific environment. Moreover, the traditional NSGA-II algorithm (Non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm-II) is prone to falling into local optimal solutions and the numerical values obtained are not accurate enough. In this paper, the concepts of clustering algorithm, difference operator and symmetrical solution are introduced in the process of crossover and mutation, and then the new algorithm of INSGA-II (Improved Non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm-II)) is proposed. On the basis of this algorithm, the emissivity model of BP network is combined to solve the target true temperature. The experimental results show that the maximum temperature measurement error can reach 60 K if the influence of high temperature background is ignored. After removing the influence of high temperature background, the non-adaptive emissivity model was used to obtain the maximum temperature error of 30 K, and the fluctuation between adjacent temperature points was large.

We performed laboratory experiments to examine how two fish species (yellow perch, Perca flavescens, and walleye, Sander vitreus) with similar thermal preferences respond to chronic exposure to subdaily temperature variability. We selected temperature treatments that reflected observed thermal variation after examining water temperature data from multiple aquatic systems. We then separately exposed yellow perch and walleye to a stable 23 degrees C treatment and 12-h cycles of 23 +/- 2 degrees C or 23 +/- 4 degrees C for 45days.

Temperature fluctuations, though, resulted in mortalities and the development of skin ulcers in yellow perch that did not occur under stable temperatures. In contrast, the same 12-h temperature fluctuations did not result in mortalities or stress responses in juvenile walleye.

In fish fed to satiety, specific growth rate was positively correlated to the food intake, which was double at 20 degrees C, compared with 8 degrees C. Minor changes were observed in food efficiency. Body fat deposition decreased as temperature increased (25% lower at 20 degrees C, compared with 8 degrees C). Apparent food conversion, PER (protein efficiency ratio) and PUC (protein utilization coefficient) ranges were 0.8-0.9, 2.1-2.3 and 33-38% respectively.

Open Top Chambers (OTCs) have been widely used to assess summer warming effects on terrestrial biota, with their effects during other seasons normally being given less attention even though chambers are often deployed year-round. In addition, their effects on temperature extremes and freeze-thaw events are poorly documented. To provide robust documentation of the microclimatic influences of OTCs throughout the year, we analysed temperature data from 20 studies distributed across polar and alpine regions. The effects of OTCs on mean temperature showed a large range (-0.9 to 2.1 degrees C) throughout the year, but did not differ significantly between studies. Increases in mean monthly and diurnal temperature were strongly related (R-2 = 0.70) with irradiance, indicating that PAR can be used to predict the mean warming effect of OTCs. Deeper snow trapped in OTCs also induced higher temperatures at soil/vegetation level. OTC-induced changes in the frequency of freeze-thaw events included an increase in autumn and decreases in spring and summer. Frequency of high-temperature events in OTCs increased in spring, summer and autumn compared with non-manipulated control plots. Frequency of low-temperature events was reduced by deeper snow accumulation and higher mean temperatures. The strong interactions identified between aspects of ambient environmental conditions and effects of OTCs suggest that a detailed knowledge of snow depth, temperature and irradiance levels enables us to predict how OTCs will modify the microclimate at a particular site and season. Such predictive power allows a better mechanistic understanding of observed biotic response to experimental warming studies and for more informed design of future experiments. However, a need remains to quantify OTC effects on water availability and wind speed (affecting, for example, drying rates and water stress) in combination with microclimate measurements at organism level.",,,,,"Gudmundsson, Jon/AAD-1659-2021; Bokhorst, Stef/D-1858-2009; Johnstone, Jill F./C-9204-2009; Convey, Peter/AAV-5728-2020","Gudmundsson, Jon/0000-0002-1703-8916; Johnstone, Jill F./0000-0001-6131-9339; Convey, Peter/0000-0001-8497-9903; Aerts, Rien/0000-0001-6694-0669; Jonsdottir, Ingibjorg Svala/0000-0003-3804-7077; Bokhorst, Stef/0000-0003-0184-1162; Hollister, Robert/0000-0002-4764-7691",,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JAN,2013,19,1,,,,,64,74,,10.1111/gcb.12028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.12028,,,,,,,,23504721,,,,,WOS:000312155100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

UAV-borne thermography can monitor crop water status near real-time, which enables precise irrigation scheduling based on an accurate decision-making strategy. The crop water stress index (CWSI) is a widely adopted indicator of plant water stress for irrigation management practices; however, dependence of its efficacy on data acquisition time during the daytime is yet to be investigated rigorously. In this paper, plant water stress captured by a series of UAV remote sensing campaigns at different times of the day (9h, 12h and 15h) in a nectarine orchard were analyzed to examine the diurnal behavior of plant water stress represented by the CWSI against measured plant physiological parameters. CWSI values were derived using a probability modelling, named 'Adaptive CWSI', proposed by our earlier research. The plant physiological parameters, such as stem water potential (psi(stem)) and stomatal conductance (g(s)), were measured on plants for validation concurrently with the flights under different irrigation regimes (0, 20, 40 and 100 % of ETc). Estimated diurnal CWSIs were compared with plant-based parameters at different data acquisition times of the day. Results showed a strong relationship between psi(stem) measurements and the CWSIs at midday (12 h) with a high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.83). Diurnal CWSIs showed a significant R-2 to g(s) over different levels of irrigation at three different times of the day with R-2 = 0.92 (9h), 0.77 (12h) and 0.86 (15h), respectively. The adaptive CWSI method used showed a robust capability to estimate plant water stress levels even with the small range of changes presented in the morning. Results of this work indicate that CWSI values collected by UAV-borne thermography between mid-morning and mid-afternoon can be used to map plant water stress with a consistent efficacy. This has important implications for extending the time-window of UAV-borne thermography (and subsequent areal coverage) for accurate plant water stress mapping beyond midday.",,,,,"Fuentes, Sigfredo/J-6238-2015; Ryu, Dongryeol/C-5903-2008","Fuentes, Sigfredo/0000-0002-0377-5085; Ryu, Dongryeol/0000-0002-5335-6209",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2072-4292,,,,JUL,2021,13,14,,,,,,,2775,10.3390/rs13142775,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13142775,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000676922300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Quadrupole and particle multiplicity fluctuations using Landau's theory of fluctuations near the critical point are derived. As an example, we apply our approach to heavy ion collisions using the Constrained Molecular Dynamics model (CoMD) which includes the Fermi statistics. The model shows some clusterization into deuteron (d) and alpha (alpha) clusters but it is not enough to reproduce available experimental data. We propose a modification of the collision term in the approach to include the possibility of alpha-alpha collisions. The relevant Bose-Einstein factor in the collision term is properly taken into account. This approach increases the yields of bosons relative to fermions closer to data. Boson fluctuations become larger than 1 as expected. If they are confirmed a new field of research could open up for a mixture of strongly interacting fermions and bosons which requires novel techniques both theoretically and experimentally.

In three experiments male British United Turkeys (BUT), from 3 to 6 weeks of age, were exposed to constant 20 degrees C, or to 35/25 degrees C or 30/20 degrees C diurnal temperature cycling, all at 50% RH and with VR (expressed as air velocity (AV)) ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 m s(-1). The 2nd and 3rd of these experiments included a positive control at constant 30 degrees C and VR of 1.5 m s(-1). Weight gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency were measured or calculated, as appropriate; SHL was calculated from measured surface temperature, and plasma concentrations of triiodothyronine (T-3) was determined in the 1st experiment. Changes of VR at constant 20 degrees C did not affect performance, but total SHL increased significantly with increasing VR. Under the 35/25 degrees C regime a significantly higher BW was recorded, with a similar pattern of feed efficiency, when VR during the hot part of the cycle was 1.5 or 2.0 m s(-1) than when it was 0.8 m In the 3rd experiment, BW in the 35/20 degrees C treatment was significantly lower than that of the controls. In all experiments, turkeys maintained body temperature (T-b) within the normothermic range, and SHL varied with VR. It can be concluded that although diurnal temperature cycling reflects the natural situation, exposing young turkeys to constant 30 degrees C combined with optimal ventilation might yield the best performance results.

The in situ temperature response did not follow an Optimum Curve but under saturating irradiances [PPFD >800 mumol(photon) m(-2) s(-1)] highest DeltaF/F(m)' occurred at leaf temperatures below 10 degreesC. This was comparable to the temperature response of antarctic vascular plants. Leaf temperatures between 0 and 15 degreesC were the most frequently (41 to 56%) experienced by the investigated species. At these temperatures, DeltaF/F(m)' was highest in all species (data from all irradiation classes included) but the species differed in the temperature at which DeltaF/F(m)' dropped below 50% (Soldanella pusilla >20 degreesC, Loiseleuria procumbens >25 degreesC, and Saxifraga paniculata >40 degreesC). The in situ response of DeltaF/F(m)' showed significantly higher DeltaF/F(m)' values at saturating PPFD for the species growing in full sunlight (S. paniculata and L. procumbens) than for S. pusilla growing under more moderate PPFD. The effect of increasing PPFD on DeltaF/F(m)', for a given leaf temperature, was most pronounced in S. pusilla. Despite the broad diurnal leaf temperature amplitude of alpine environments, only in S. paniculata did saturating PPFD occur over a broad range of leaf temperatures (43 K). In the other two species it was half of that (around 20 K).

While ectothermic top predators may compensate by increasing foraging, ectothermic prey may be unable to increase foraging because of increased predation risk from ectothermic predators. We examined how the diurnal drift behavior (i.e., the downstream movement associated with foraging) of the mayfly Baetis, an ectothermic herbivore, responds to changing temperature in the implied presence and absence of trout, an ectothermic predator. In an experiment replicated at the catchment scale, water temperature and trout presence strongly interacted to affect the diurnal drift of Baetis from artificial channels lacking periphyton over a water temperature range of 4.2-14.8 A degrees C. In fishless streams, daytime drift increased with increasing water temperature, likely because of increased metabolic demand for food. However, in trout-bearing streams, daytime drift decreased with increasing water temperature. Our interpretation is that the perceived threat of trout rose with increasing water temperature, causing mayflies to reduce foraging despite heightened metabolic demand. These results suggest that anticipated increases in stream temperature due to climate change may further escalate divergence in structure and process between fishless and trout-bearing streams.

However, still controversial are the results about age-related circadian variations of sleepiness levels. The objective of this study is to investigate the profile of diurnal sleepiness in healthy elderly subjects through subjective scales and by measuring spontaneous eye-blink rate (BR). In fact, we have previously found that BR, a reliable and non-invasive peripheral measure of central dopamine activity, increases in the young at times when subjective sleepiness is increased. Twelve healthy elderly volunteers (F = 9, M = 3, age range 64-79) participated in the experiment. At four times during the day (10 a.m., 1.30 p.m., 5 p.m., 8.30 p.m.), Karolinska sleepiness scale and a visual analogue scale for mood were administered to the subjects and BR was measured through vertical EOG. Alpha EEG power was used as objective measure of sleepiness. Sleepiness significantly changes across the day; according to post hoc contrasts, this is due to more sleepiness at 5 p.m. Future research should be aimed at clarifying whether this peak is related to phase-advanced core body temperature in elderly people. Differently from the young, no significant differences were found in BR across the day, suggesting that an age-related modification of dopaminergic arousal mechanisms counteracting the rising sleep drive should be further explored.

Abnormally high temperatures during pod setting to pod development stage induces reduction in pod setting, nonhealthy development and early maturity of grain which results in yield decline. We evaluated the effect of elevated temperatures in a Temperature Gradient Tunnel (TGT) on phenology, physiology and crop performance of green gram cultivars at semi-arid climate of Indian Punjab (Ludhiana). Five green gram cultivars were grown in TGT chambers in a factorial randomized block design with varying level of elevated temperatures (+3.3 degrees C to 5.2 degrees C) for two consecutive kharif seasons (2015-2016). The results reveal that the phenological stages of green gram, were advanced under elevated temperature within the TGT compared to open / ambient condition by 12-13 days. Maximum influence was observed in pod formation and pod maturity stages. With rise in temperatures by 3.3 to 5.2 degrees C in TGT over ambient condition, the plant height increased but the number of branches per plant and the total above ground biomass as well as grain yield decreased consistently. It was found that with 1 degrees C increase in average seasonal temperature, the grain yield decreased by 75 kg ha(-1). On the other hand, the harvest index was in general lower inside TGT chamber implying adverse influence of elevated temperature on biomass production although the partitioning of biomass was more efficient inside the TGT as evident from increase in harvest index. There was strong negative correlation of elevated temperature (inside TGT) with different yield attributes like 1000 seed weight, number of seeds per pod and number of pods per plant. Among the five green gram cultivars, ML-2037 was the most tolerant while cv. SML-1811 was the most susceptible to elevated temperature condition. In general, the grain yield decreased linearly with gradual increase in temperature. Average seasonal temperature of 29-30 degrees C may be considered as the favourable thermal conditions for the green gram crop in semi-arid conditions of Punjab. However, the future thrust will be to create more temperature gradients in the lower side so that the critical temperature threshold limits for optimum yield of green gram can be ascertained more accurately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0972-1665,,,,,MAR,2021,23,1,,,,,3,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000635591500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Threonine,ANIMAL SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Two similar experiments (1 and 2) were conducted to measure the effects of a range of dietary threonine concentrations and environmental temperatures on the performance of pigs grown from 13 to 25 kg live weight. In both experiments 48 Large White X Landrace entire male pigs were assigned at 13 kg to one of six dietary threonine treatments (8.9 (T1), 7.6 (T2), 6.2 (T3), 4.9 (T4), 3.6 (T5) g/kg and T5 + supplemented threonine (T6)) and one of four temperature treatments (18, 22, 26 and 30 degrees C). Animals were given ad libitum access to food until 25 kg live weight. There were significant interactions (P < 0.05) between temperature and threonine content on the rate of growth (ADG) with the highest gains on T1 and at 22 degrees C. Similarly the response in food intake (FI) to dietary threonine pins significantly (P < 0.01) modified by the ambient temperature. An increase in the supply of threonine in the diet resulted in significant increases (P < 0.001) in the gain per unit of food (FCE). A similar response to temperature occurred with the highest FCE recorded at 26 degrees C and the lowest at 18 degrees C. There was a 0.20 proportional reduction in body protein content at 25 kg live weight in pigs given T5 compared with those given T1 and similarly, excluding T6 because threonine may nor have been the most limiting amino acid, the fat content was 1.37 higher for pigs on T5 versus T1, which had the lowest fat content. Similar trends occurred in protein and lipid growth rates with maximum protein deposition recorded on T1 (86 (s.e. 3.5) g/day) and maximum lipid deposition on T5 (108 (s.e. 5.8)g/day), over all temperatures. The response in total heat loss was similar to that observed in FI with the effect of decreasing threonine content being dependent on the environmental temperature. Linens regression of daily empty body threonine accretion on daily digestible threonine intake showed an average efficiency of threonine utilization for pigs between 12 kg and 25 kg live weight of 0.59 (s.e. 0.03). There were no differences in efficiency between temperatures. In conclusion, decreasing the threonine concentration below the requirement of the animal resulted in a significant decrease in ADG, reduced FCE and fatter animals. Pigs given a diet deficient in threonine will attempt to maintain threonine intake as the concentration declines by increasing food intake but this compensation is dependent on the environmental temperature. Pigs are able to compensate better for a deficiency in threonine at 18 degrees C and 22 degrees C than at higher temperatures due to the animals being able to dissipate more heat at the lower temperatures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1357-7298,,,,,APR,2000,70,,2,,,,287,297,,10.1017/S1357729800054746,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1357729800054746,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000086848400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

A majority of the tested bioactive components showed generally declining trends from the north (high latitude) to the south (low latitude). A positive relationship between total oligosaccharides (TO) and altitude was observed.

Total saponins (TS) were negatively correlated with MDT but positively correlated with rainfall (RF), whereas TO were negatively correlated with RF. Path-coefficient analysis showed that, besides genotype differences, temperature and HS during the reproductive period influenced TI and TP contents, while temperature and RF influenced TS and TO.

However, the necessary degree of thermal stability required in broadband installations to avoid generating noise or compromising the fidelity in the seismic records is largely unknown and likely application dependent. To quantify the temperature sensitivity of seismometers over a broad range of frequencies, we artificially induced local temperature changes on three different models of seismometers to measure the effect of thermal variations on seismometer output. We found that diurnal temperature changes above 0.002 degrees C root mean square (rms) showed significant changes in velocity and acceleration output in comparison to thermally stable reference measurements. We also found that sensor incoherent self-noise increased with temperature variation; these increases in noise can be modeled as 1/f noise (pink noise), and are unlikely to be easily corrected for. These experimental results are compared with the data from Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Global Seismographic Network (GSN) station TUC (Tucson, Arizona). This station is well instrumented with temperature sensors and has three different broadband seismometers, each of which uses a different method of thermal isolation. We show that the water bricks and borehole installations give ample temperature attenuation to thermally isolate seismometers from diurnal thermal variability that would compromise seismic data. We find that seismometer installations that provide thermal stability below 0.002 degrees C rms could help to improve long-period vertical seismic data across the GSN by decreasing temperature-driven 1/f noise.",,,,,"Anthony, Rob/J-2212-2017","Anthony, Robert/0000-0001-7089-8846",,,,,,,,,,,,,0037-1106,1943-3573,,,,FEB,2018,108,1,,,,,493,502,,10.1785/0120170233,http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/0120170233,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000429114900039,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gravid females and adult males were inoculated in petri dishes containing agar layers of nine (for P. marina) or five (for D. meyli) different salinities, from almost freshwater to higher than marine, and incubated at a temperature of 20 degrees C, to study the impact of salinity; agar layers with a salinity of 20 parts per thousand, incubated under each of six different temperatures from 5 to 30 degrees C, served to study the effect of temperature. Daily and total fecundity, development time and sex ratio were quantified, and preadult mortality was estimated. The results are compared to those of a partner study on the influence of salinity and temperature on respiration, assimilation and scope for production in the same nematode species. Salinity had relatively minor effects on fecundity, development times and sex ratio in both species, but strongly impacted juvenile viability at the extremes of the salinity range: at salinities close to 0 and 40 parts per thousand, preadult mortality was more than 80% in P, marina; it was 100% at 5 parts per thousand in D, meyli. Both species had an (near) optimal fitness at salinities of 10 to 30 parts per thousand. Temperature had a pronounced influence on both nematodes over the entire range studied. Diplolaimelloides meyli still reproduced acid matured at temperatures exceeding 30 degrees C, while P. marina had an upper temperature limit for reproduction of 25 degrees C. Development times of D. meyli were more temperature-dependent than those of P. marina: the mean development time from adult to adult for the latter nematode ranged from 2 days at 25 degrees C to 7 days at 9 degrees C. The development time of D. meyli increased from 7 days at 25-30 degrees C to 63 days at 10 degrees C, temperature below which no reproduction occurred. Female-biased sex ratios were found in D. meyli at low temperatures and in P. marina under optimal salinity conditions. The Life history results largely agree with the predicted scope for production, but discrepancies were found near the extremes of the abiotic range of both species. It is emphasized that the ranges observed are characteristic of populations, not of species; they may to an extent have been influenced by culture conditions. A comparison of the present results with literature data on other P. marina populations demonstrates that some populations of this species may still reproduce successfully under conditions which are lethal to other populations, raising the question as to whether cryptic species rather than populations of a single species are involved.

Maximum temperatures in the upstream bedrock reach were up to 8.6degreesC higher and 3.4 degreesC lower than downstream in the alluvial reach. Better understanding of factors that influence not only maximum but minimum temperatures as well as diurnal temperature variation will highlight types of reaches in which stream temperature would be most responsive to changes in shading.

In the condition of R 1, the distribution of the time-averaged temperature is the axial-symmetry. In the cold fluid field, the temperature field is divided into four parts, including the first steady region, linear region, nonlinear region and the second steady region along the axial direction, while that is lack of the first steady state region in the hot fluid field. In the condition of R = 1, due to the velocity of the cold fluid is equivalent to that of the hot fluid, the cold fluid flow can be severely disturbed by the hot flow.

Ejaculates were. collected once per week from five Chios rams and four East Friesian rams for 12 months and stored in liquid nitrogen. Frozen-thawed semen samples were analyzed using the SCSA, to determine the DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and the percentage of cells outside the main sperm population (%DFI) in each one of the samples. Scrotal surface temperature (SST) of each ram was measured using an infrared thermometer on a daily basis. Ambient air temperature and relative humidity were recorded at hourly intervals throughout the experimental period and temperature-humidity index (THI) was used to assess the discomfort felt by the rams. Mean values of SST (SSTmean) and THI (THImean) were computed for eight different time periods (up to 61 days) preceding each ejaculation day (Day 0). A linear mixed-effect model analysis was performed to describe the relation of SCSA parameters to collection month, SSTmean, and THImean of different time periods before ejaculation. The results of the statistical analysis revealed a relation of %DFI to the SSTmean of the last 12 days preceding ejaculation, namely the period that resembled the phase of epididymal maturation. On the contrary, the variation of DFI was most adequately described by the linear mixed-effect model applied for Days 54 to 48 before ejaculation, which resembled the phase of spermatogonial mitoses. The effect of collection month was significant for DFI and %DFI, with semen samples collected in September and February exhibiting the lowest DFI values; a less profound seasonal pattern was detected for %DFI. The effect of THImean on DFI and %DFI was proven nonsignificant in regard to all time periods. In conclusion, a relation of SCSA parameters to SSTmean of different periods before ejaculation was shown in the present study, implying an effect of scrotal microenvironment on intratesticular and epididymal sperm population. In contrast, we failed to detect any effect of microclimate-induced discomfort felt by the animals on the chromatin integrity of frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Two scenarios of three coupled atmosphere-ocean circulation models were used to run the soil temperature model. Modeled projections of minimum soil surface temperatures in the northeastern U.S. indicate that warming will occur over the majority of the region over the 2000-2099 period.

In these northern regions, the coldest soil surface temperatures are also projected to occur later in winter, but show little change in other regions.

Climate models provide useful tools for studying underlying processes and amplifying effects associated with extremes. The Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS) has recently been coupled to the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model. We examine how this model represents climate extremes derived by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and compare them to observational data sets using the AMIP framework. We find that the patterns of extreme indices are generally well represented. Indices based on percentiles are particularly well represented and capture the trends over the last 60 years shown by the observations remarkably well. The diurnal temperature range is underestimated, minimum temperatures (T-MIN) during nights are generally too warm and daily maximum temperatures (T-MAX) too low in the model. The number of consecutive wet days is overestimated, while consecutive dry days are underestimated. The maximum consecutive 1-day precipitation amount is underestimated on the global scale. Biases in T-MIN correlate well with biases in incoming longwave radiation, suggesting a relationship with biases in cloud cover. Biases in T-MAX depend on biases in net shortwave radiation as well as evapotranspiration. The regions and season where the bias in evapotranspiration plays a role for the T-MAX bias correspond to regions and seasons where soil moisture availability is limited.

Knowledge is scarce about actual energetic costs that can be associated with internal acclimatization processes as a response to thermal extremes. In the present study changes in cellular energy allocation, oxygen consumption rate and energy related enzymes' activity (IDH and LDH) were measured in juvenile H. scabra, held at different temperatures: 21, 27 and 33 degrees C. The results showed that the steady temperature change (1 degrees C/day) to both temperature treatments, until reaching the testing temperatures (day 0), clearly affected cellular energy consumption and available energy reserves, measured in the respiratory tree and muscle tissue, respectively. However, 15 and 30 days after acclimation, the initial differences in cellular energy allocation between treatments decreased. In contrast to the variations measured in cellular energy allocation, oxygen consumption was highest at 33 degrees C and lowest at 21 degrees C at all three measurement times. Moreover, a significant positive correlation between oxygen consumption rate and temperature was detected at day 15 and day 30. Likewise, a shift from anaerobic to aerobic energy metabolism, indicated by changes in LDH and IDH activities, was observed in the animals from the warm temperature treatment. Results imply that juvenile H. scabra were able to recover from initial disturbances in energy balance, caused by the incremental temperature change of +/- 6 degrees C. Over the experimental period of 30 days, elevated temperature did however, lead to a metabolic shift and more efficient energy turnover, indicated by changes in oxygen consumption rate, LDH and IDH. The synergy of cellular energy allocation and oxygen consumption proved to be a viable indicator to assess the capability of sea cucumbers like H. scabra to cope with extreme temperature conditions. Surprisingly, juvenile H. scabra were able to sustain their energy balance and oxygen consumption rate within the homeostatic range, even at 33 degrees C. Thus, we assume that rearing temperatures of 33 degrees C might be possible, which could improve aquaculture production of H. scabra. However, further research is required to understand the mechanisms and effects of acclimation under aquaculture conditions. Statement of relevance: The sea cucumber H. scabra is considered a promising aquaculture candidate in the tropics. The commercial interest in H. scabra has led to a great number of attempts to culture this species e.g. in Madagascar, Tanzania, India and Indonesia, where the farming of this species also showed a great potential to increase the livelihood of the local community. Although, considerable research effort has been put into the advancement of the production cycle, fundamental knowledge, e.g. on physiological adjustments due to suboptimal rearing conditions, remains scarce for H. scabra. Water temperature has been identified as crucial factor, determining production efficiency. In our manuscript we introduce an innovative approach, for the assessment of shifts in the energy budget as well as in metabolic pathways, to detect thermal stress in juvenile H. scabra. Our results show that the combined application of cellular energy allocation (CEA) and measurement of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as well as the activity of two metabolic key enzymes: iso-citrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is a strong analytical tool to evaluate whole animal homeostasis under thermal extremes. To our knowledge this is the first study in which the method of CEA was optimized for the application on isolated muscle and respiratory tree tissue of a sea cucumber, like H. scabra. Hence, our results provide original insights into the thermal acclimation physiology of H. scabra, which provides crucial knowledge for setting up optimal culture conditions for this highly valuable aquaculture candidate. Moreover, our results show that juvenile H. scabra were strongly affected by rapid temperature changes, exhibiting distinct differences in metabolic adjustments as response to short-term cold and warm acclimation, but were able to restore homeostatic conditions at constant cold and warm temperature extremes. Concerning aquaculture practices, these findings imply that CEA might be a good condition indicator to evaluate the overall metabolic status in sea cucumbers. Moreover, rapid temperature fluctuations seem to provoke much higher energetic costs in juvenile H. scabra than constant extreme temperature conditions, which is important to consider in daily management practices. The OCR revealed an enhanced metabolism at warmer temperature conditions, throughout the entire experimental period. Likewise, the warm exposed animals were shifting their energy turnover from a more anaerobic to a more aerobic state, indicated by changes in LDH and IDH activities, and showed increased foraging activity at all times. The combined outcome of CEA, OCR and activities of energy metabolism related enzymes indicates, that the increased metabolic activity in juvenile H. scabra, as response to warmer temperature, was well within the homeostatic range. Thus, contrary to our expectations, a rearing temperature of up to 33 degrees C might presumably be favourable for the aquaculture of H. scabra. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Chemometric methods were extensively studied to correct the effect of temperature variations. However, temperature can be considered as a constructive parameter that provides detailed chemical information when systematically changed during the measurement. Our group has researched the relationship between temperature-induced spectral variation (TSVC) and normalized squared temperature. In this study, we focused on the influence of temperature distribution in calibration set. Multi-temperature calibration set selection (MTCS) method was proposed to improve the prediction accuracy by considering the temperature distribution of calibration samples. Furthermore, double-temperature calibration set selection (DTCS) method was proposed based on MTCS method and the relationship between TSVC and normalized squared temperature. We compare the prediction performance of PLS models based on random sampling method and proposed methods. The results from experimental studies showed that the prediction performance was improved by using proposed methods. Therefore, MTCS method and DTCS method will be the alternative methods to improve prediction accuracy in near-infrared spectral measurement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental observations indicate that in unplanted beds, daily thermal fluctuations are depth dependent and range from 1 to 9 degrees Celsius. These fluctuations result in daily thermal inversions, and enhanced mixing and oxygen transport. For planted beds, thermal fluctuations are depth independent, and have a constant amplitude of 2 degrees Celsius. Planted beds may be thermally stratified. Lithium tracer studies corroborate these results for the planted bed. In addition, performance studies indicate that organic pollutant removal is probably limited to organic suspended solids removal, with subsequent biological breakdown.

For temperature experiments, ten 24 hour trials were conducted each at 10.5degreesC and 7degreesC, using flow-through respirometry. Average routine VO2 was approximately 130 mg O-2/(kg*hr) at 10.5degreesC and approximately 120 mg O-2/(kg*hr) at 7degreesC. These values did not differ significantly, probably because we used temperatures spanning the thermal range of bloater, within which this species may conserve routine metabolism. Derivations of daily food ration for bloater were calculated and compared with a previous bioenergetics model. For pressure experiments, the diel vertical migrations bloater undertake in the wild were simulated using a flow-through respirometer that could be pressurized. Ten 3-day trials were conducted, consisting of an overnight acclimation to the respirometer, a 12-hour pressure regime, and a day of recovery. The pressure regime involved a compression from 1 atm (atmospheric pressure) to 4 atm over 6 hours and a subsequent decompression of the same magnitude and duration. Increases in hydrostatic pressure elicited a rise in bloater VO2 and motor activity; conversely, the subsequent decrease in hydrostatic pressure caused a return of oxygen uptake and motor activity to baseline values at I atm. We hypothesize that pressure-induced compression of the gas bladder explain the changes in VO2, because increased swimming (causing increased VO2) is needed to maintain station when the swimbladder is compressed.",,,,,"stevens, don/AAI-6983-2021; Stevens, Ernest/G-9569-2014","Stevens, Ernest/0000-0002-3113-1543; Speers-Roesch, Ben/0000-0001-6510-7501",,,,,,,,,,,,,0380-1330,,,,,,2004,30,1,,,,,70,81,,10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70330-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70330-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000220858500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results reveal three dominant types of internal tides (diurnal, semidiurnal, and terdiurnal). Spectral analysis of the range-average temperature deviation along the northern and southern transmission paths shows that along the northern path, the energy of the diurnal internal tides was significantly larger than that of the semidiurnal tides. The semidiurnal internal tides, in contrast, were more pronounced along the southern path. A terdiurnal spectrum with an energy level equivalent to that of the semidiurnal internal tide was discernable for both the northern and southern paths. These three types of internal tides can also be recognized in the time variation of the zonal-average temperature deviation. The diurnal internal tides were strengthened along the northern coast, implying their westward propagation and the existence of coastally trapped effects. The other two types of internal tides, which have smaller wavelengths than the diurnal internal tides, were less resolved over the entire tomographic domain due to the insufficient resolution of the inversion.

Lake temperatures measured at a resolution of 2 min at 15 depths ranging from 0.2 to 43 m, which were observed during the 6 July-5 November 2018 period, were analyzed. The results show thermocline deepening from 10 m at the beginning of the observation period to 16 m at the end of the observation period, where the latter depth corresponds to approximately one-third of the lake depth. The pycnocline followed the same pattern, except that the deepening occurred throughout the entire period approximately 1 m above the thermocline. On average, thermocline deepening was 3-4 cm d(-1), while the maximum deepening (12.5 cm d(-1)) co-incided with the occurrence of internal seiches. Furthermore, the results indicate three different types of forcings on the lake surface; two of these forcings have diurnal periodicity - (1) continuous heat fluxes and (2) occasional periodic stronger winds - whereas forcing (3) corresponds to occasional nonperiodic stronger winds with steady along-basin directions. Continuous heat fluxes (1) produced forced diurnal oscillations in the lake temperature within the first 5 m of the lake throughout the entire observation period. Non-continuous periodic stronger winds (2) resulted in occasional forced diurnal oscillations in the lake temperatures at depths from approximately 7 to 20 m. Occasional strong and steady along-basin winds (3) triggered both baroclinic internal seiches with a principal period of 8.0 h and barotropic surface seiches with a principal period of 9 min Lake currents produced by the surface seiches under realistic-topography conditions generated baroclinic oscillations of the thermocline region (at depths from 9 to 17 m) with periods corresponding to the period of surface seiches 9 approximate to min), which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported in previous lake studies.",,,,,"Klaic, Zvjezdana z/K-7301-2012","Klaic, Zvjezdana/0000-0002-8426-9351; Babic, Karmen/0000-0002-4878-6167",,,,,,,,,,,,,1027-5606,1607-7938,,,,JUL 3,2020,24,7,,,,,3399,3416,,10.5194/hess-24-3399-2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3399-2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000547403100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is particularly true of oviparous species where development typically occurs outside of the female, and studies have shown that traits such as survival and behavior can be altered by both temperature and exposure to steroid hormones during development. In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), the fate of gonadal development can be affected by temperature and by maternal estrogens present in the egg at oviposition, and there is evidence that these factors can affect gene expression patterns. Here, we explored how thermal fluctuations and exposure to an estrogen metabolite, estrone sulfate, affect the expression of several genes known to be involved in sexual differentiation: Kdm6b, Dmrt1, Sox9, FoxL2 and Cyp19A1. We found that most of the genes responded to both temperature and estrone sulfate exposure, but that the responses to these factors were not identical, in that estrone sulfate effects occur downstream of temperature effects.

Such rapid increase during the crop growth stages, particularly during extremely sensitive reproductive and early grain-filling stages of rice (Oryza sativa L), leads to reduced biomass, grain yield and quality. Field experiments and lab analyses were carried out using three Basmati and two non-Basmati cultivars to study the effect of a wide range of diurnal temperatures and radiation. Night temperature had a significant negative effect on grain yield (P < 0.001) and quality (P < 0.01) beyond 22 degrees C. Reduced spikelet fertility followed by grain weight plant(-1) accounted for the decline in yield. Radiation however had a positive influence on yield and grain quality. A definite relationship between maximum day temperature and grain yield could not be established as the temperatures were generally <= the critical 35 degrees C during sensitive developmental stages. Environment 4 gave significantly highest yield, indicating a narrow window of optimum growing conditions for better yield and quality. Hence, increasing diurnal temperature tolerance in rice is a sustainable approach than altering well established cropping patterns, which will inevitably lead to yield penalties.

In the first experiment, eggshell temperature (ET) in the control group was kept constant at 37.8 degrees C, and embryos in the experimental group were exposed to varying ET within the range of 36.8 to 38.8 degrees C using ET steps of 0.2 degrees C and time steps of 3 h. This was repeated in 3 periods between 6.5 and 9.5 d, 10.5 and 13.5 d, and 14.5 and 17.5 d. In the studied ET range, heat production (HP) increased linearly at 4.9% per 1 C ET.

When MT was decreased, CO2 production initially increased at 0.5% and decreased thereafter. When MT was increased, CO2 production initially decreased at 0.4% and increased thereafter. It was concluded that embryonic HP responded linearly with short-term ET changes in the studied ET range of 36.8 to 38.8 degrees C. Changes in CO2 concentration due to short-term MT changes could not be explained by embryonic HP only. It can be speculated that blood flow through the chorio-allantoic membrane changes with MT, affecting heat transfer and diffusion of CO2. A second, delayed response to MT changes was in accordance with the findings in Experiment 1. Within the studied temperature range it will be difficult to use embryonic metabolic responses as a tool to control the incubation process. Because HP is linearly related to ET as in the studied temperature range, other factors such as O-2 availability or CO2 release may limit embryo development at higher ET.

We estimated daily rates of respiration and gross primary production (GPP) for up to a full year in each lake, via maximum likelihood fits of a free-water metabolism model to continuous high-frequency measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations. Uncertainties were determined by a bootstrap analysis, allowing lake-days with poorly constrained rate estimates to be down-weighted in subsequent analyses. GPP and respiration varied considerably among lakes and at seasonal and daily timescales. Mean annual GPP and respiration ranged from 0.1 to 5.0 mg O-2 L-1 d(-1) and were positively related to total phosphorus but not dissolved organic carbon concentration. Within lakes, significant day-to-day differences in respiration were common despite large uncertainties in estimated rates on some lake-days.

We observed statolith growth from newly hatched to 10-day-old paralarvae and used alizarine complexone staining to attempt validation of the growth. The maximum statolith radius (MSR) of newly hatched paralarvae was constant at 21.1 mum across the full range of temperatures, with the exception of 25.4degreesC. Daily growth of MSR was analysed separately in two phases, the pre-yolk-absorption phase (i.e. yolk sac still present) and the post-yolk-absorption phase. During the pre-yolk-absorption phase, the daily growth rate (DGR, y) of the MSR varied from 3 to 7 mum day(-1) depending on rearing temperature (x) and was expressed as y = 0.37x - 1.77. We concluded that the natal ring forms at 21 mum MSR.

As thermal tolerances form an important component of a species' niche, changes to the temperature regime have the capacity to negatively impact species, and therefore, the diversity of the communities they inhabit. In this study, we used protist microcosms to assess how mean temperature, as well as temporal variation in temperature, affected diversity. Communities consisted of seven species in a multitrophic food web. Each ecosystem was inoculated with the same abundances of each species at the start of the experiment, and species densities, Hill's numbers (based on Shannon diversity), the number of extinctions, and the probability the microcosm contained predators were all calculated at the end of the experiment. To assess how mean temperature and temperature fluctuations affect stability, we also measured population densities through time. We found that increased temporal variation in temperature increased final densities, increased Hill's numbers (at low mean temperatures), decreased rates of extinctions, and increased the probability that predators survived till the end of the experiment. Mean temperatures did not significantly affect either the number of extinctions or the probability of predators, but did reduce the positive effect of increased temporal variation in temperature on overall diversity. Our results indicate that climatic changes have the potential to impact the composition of ecological communities by altering multiple components of temperature regimes. However, given that some climate forecasts are predicting increased mean temperatures and reduced variability, our finding that increased mean temperature and reduced temporal variation are both generally associated with negative consequences is somewhat concerning.",,,,,"Hammill, Edd/F-9030-2013","Hammill, Edd/0000-0001-8247-6106",,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,FEB,2022,12,2,,,,,,,e8665,10.1002/ece3.8665,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8665,,,,,,,,35228865,,,,,WOS:000760366500075,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyzed >= 48 years of records from 186 climate stations of Mainland China to estimate the annual probabilities of reaching the lower lethal temperature for S. incertulas. The relevant climatic metric, minimum annual temperature, approximated a normal distribution. Consequently, the probability density function for any site could be characterized with the mean and standard deviation of minimum annual temperatures. We used the local regression method to map the mean and standard deviation of minimum annual temperatures throughout Mainland China and then calculated isolines representing annual probabilities for reaching or exceeding the lower lethal temperature of S. incertulas. In addition, we calculated and mapped the number of generations per year based on the annual accumulative degree days and the sum of effective temperatures required to complete one generation. The empirical northern distribution limits of S. incertulas were generally congruent with the theoretical limits based on winter survival, with exceptions within the Shandong and Sichuan provinces, which are apparently thermally suitable but where the host plant is not cultivated. The expected number of generations per year was 3-5 within most of the range of S. incertulas in China. In central China, the expected number of generations per year was about 3. A climate warming scenario of 4 degrees C in minimum and maximum daily temperatures predicted an increase in the expected number of generations per year in central China from about 3 to 4.

For visual examination, subjects evaluated 14 display stimuli presented on the Samsung Galaxy S3 under 19 ambient illuminants. The display stimuli were composed of 14 nuanced whites varying in color temperature from 2900 to 18,900 K. The illuminant conditions varied with combinations of color temperature (2600 to 20,100 K) and illuminance level (30 to 3100 lx) that simulated daily lighting experiences. The subjects were asked to assess the optimal level of the display color temperatures based on their mental representation of the ideal white point. The study observed a positive correlation between the illuminant color temperatures and the optimal display color temperatures (r = 0.89, p < 0.05). However, the range of the color temperature of the smartphone display was much narrower than that of the illuminants. Based on the assessments by 100 subjects, a regression formula was derived to predict the adjustment of user-preferred color temperature under changing illuminant chromaticity. The formula is as follows: [Display T-cp 6534.75 log (Illuminant T-cp) - 16304.68 (R-2 = 0.87, p < 0.05)]. Moreover, supporting previous studies on color reproduction, the effect of illuminant chromaticity was relatively weaker under lower illuminance. The results of this experiment could be used as a theoretical basis for designers and manufacturers to adjust user-preferred color temperature for smartphone displays under various illuminant conditions.

We tested the foraging rhythms of bumblebee (Bombus terrestris and B. pascuorum) colonies in northern Finland during the summer, when the sun stays above the horizon for weeks. We used fully automatic radio-frequency identification to monitor the foraging activity of more than 1,000 workers and analysed their circadian foraging rhythms. Results: Foragers did not use the available 24-h foraging period but exhibited robust diurnal rhythms instead. A mean of 95.2% of the tested B. terrestris workers showed robust diurnal rhythms with a mean period of 23.8 h. Foraging activity took place mainly between 08:00 and 23:00, with only low or almost no activity during the rest of the day. Activity levels increased steadily during the morning, reached a maximum around midday and decreased again during late afternoon and early evening. Foraging patterns of native B. pascuorum followed the same temporal organisation, with the foraging activity being restricted to the period between 06:00 and 22:00. Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that the circadian clock of the foragers must have been entrained by some external cue, the most prominent being daily cycles in light intensity and temperature. Daily fluctuations in the spectral composition of light, especially in the UV range, could also be responsible for synchronising the circadian clock of the foragers under continuous daylight conditions.",,,,,"Chittka, Lars/C-3110-2012","Chittka, Lars/0000-0001-8153-1732",,,,,,,,,,,,,1741-7007,,,,,JUN 29,2010,8,,,,,,,,93,10.1186/1741-7007-8-93,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-8-93,,,,,,,,20587015,,,,,WOS:000280352600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we used observational and experimental approaches to investigate the role of temperature and interspecific competition in controlling the structure of ground-foraging ant communities in forests of the Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon. To assess the potential role of competition, we first Used null model analyses to ask whether species partition temporal and/or spatial environments. TO understand how thermal tolerances influence the structure Of Communities, we conducted a laboratory experiment to estimate the maximum thermal tolerance of workers and a field experiment in which we added shaded microhabitats and monitored the response of foragers. Finally, to evaluate the roles of temperature and interspecific competition in the field, we simultaneously manipulated shading and the presence of a dominant competitor (Formica moki). The foraging activity of species broadly overlapped during the diurnal range of temperatures. Species co-occurrence patterns varied across the diurnal temperature range: species were spatially segregated at bait stations at low temperatures, but co-occurred randomly at high temperatures. The decreased abundance of the co-occurring themophilic Temnothorax nevadensis in shaded plots was a direct effect of shading and not an indirect effect of competitive interactions. Thermal tolerance predicted the response of ant species to the shading experiment: species with the lowest tolerances to high temperatures showed the greatest increase ill abundance in the shaded plots. Moreover, species with more similar thermal tolerance values segregated more frequently oil baits than did species that differed in their thermal tolerances.

The concept of local pairs in systems with low and intermediate charge-carrier density, which can include HTSCs, is examined. The experimental part is primarily based on the study of excess and fluctuation conductivity (FC) in YBa2Cu3O7-y (TBCO) and Y1-xPrxBa2Cu3O7-y (YPrBCO) thin epitaxial films. A new approach to analyzing FC and the pseudogap in such high-temperature systems is proposed and checked experimentally. The approach is based on the idea that excess conductivity sigma'(T) forms in HTSCs at temperatures substantially above critical temperature T, as a result of the formation of pair states in the form of noninteracting strongly bound bosons, demonstrating with decreasing temperature a transition from a regime with localized pairs conforming to the Bose-Einstein condensation theory into a regime with fluctuation Cooper pairs which conform to the BCS theory.

We investigated the thermopeaking effects on benthic invertebrate drift by simulating abrupt thermal shifts in experimental flumes. We conducted two cold thermopeaking and two warm thermopeaking simulations by quickly cooling the water by 34 degrees C during the warm season and by warming the water by 23 degrees C during the cold season at a rate of about 2.4?x?10-1 degrees C?min-1. This rate is very similar to those associated with hydropeaking waves in rivers in the same watershed as the experimental flumes. Although the achieved changes in temperature were within a tolerability range for benthic invertebrates, their drift increased threefold and fivefold, and twofold and fourfold in the two cold and two warm thermopeaking experiments, respectively. Assemblage composition of drift before and during the experiment differed, indicating that some taxa respond to abrupt thermal alterations. Larvae of Chironomidae, Simuliidae and Baetidae were the most abundant drifting taxa in all experiments during temperature alterations. The drift induced was probably behavioural, given the immediate responses of invertebrates that begun to drift within 2?min from the start of the simulations. This type of drift differs from catastrophic drift that usually occurs as a response to hydropeaking. The two types of drift can occur as distinct events in streams impacted by hydropower plants with high-elevation reservoirs and hypolimnetic releases because the propagation of the discharge and thermal waves are asynchronous, causing the benthic community to undergo two distinct but consecutive impacts. Our results suggest that the long-term effects of thermopeaking are mixed and synergical with those caused by hydropeaking and, on the long term, may alter the longitudinal distribution of benthic communities.

The objectives of this research article are two folded: first - we make use of W-ICARB meteorological database for investigation of the diurnal variability in the air-sea interaction parameters by studying the frequency distribution of the time of occurrence of minima and maxima and second - we report the significance of North-South latitudinal gradient in meteorological parameters observed during the cruise period. A careful statistical analysis revealed a significant semi-diurnal variability in the mean sea level pressure with two minima occurring consecutively at 3 LT and 15 LT, whereas the two maxima were observed at 9 LT and 21 LT respectively. With the available database, we report a new variability index representing a quantitative measure of the diurnal variability in the air-sea interaction parameters. Analysis of the W-ICARB database indicates the diurnal variability in mean sea level pressure, wind speed, sensible and latent heat flux larger than 50%, while it was ranging from 28% to 40% for the sea surface temperature, air temperature, humidity and momentum flux. On an average, the estimates of sensible and latent heat flux were marginally higher than the earlier field experiment conducted over the BoB.

Herd records collected from Holstein heifers (n = 348) and dry cows (n = 503; second through seventh lactations) were fitted with SensOor ear tags to collect hourly ear-surface temperatures. Mean temperatures were calculated from 240 hourly measures during Days 230-239 of gestation and cows within season were grouped into two median temperature groups. On Days 230-239 of gestation during May through September (hotter months) cows with high (H, range of 33.67-38.89 degrees C, mean +/- SEM = 32.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C) or medium high (MH, 25.06 -31.66 degrees C, 29.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C) temperatures were grouped together (n = 209 per group). For comparable gestational days during October through April (colder months), cows with medium low (ML, 17.82 -25.00 degrees C, 21.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C) and low (L,-0.70 to 17.80 degrees C, 13.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C) temperatures were grouped together (n = 216 per group). Prepartum traits including mean ear temperature, gestation length, days in milk at dry-off, days in close-up pen, previous 305-d milk yield, proportion of heifer calves born, and cow PTA for milk differed (P < 0.05) between seasons, but not between temperature groups within season, except predicted transmitting ability for milk was greater (P = 0.02) for ML than L cows. Postpartum treatment with antimicrobials occurred more (P = 0.02) often in H than MH cows, whereas more (P = 0.04) lameness and greater (P = 0.05) projected 305-d mature equivalent milk yield was observed in ML vs. L cows. No other health or reproductive traits were associated with temperature group, but many seasonal effects were observed across temperature groups. Less (P = 0.04) prepartum eating time during the last 10 d before calving was detected in L than in ML cows, less (P = 0.06) rumination time in ML than L cows, and more (P = 0.03) activity time was observed in H than MH cows. After calving, H cows were more (P = 0.03) active than MH cows and ML cows tended (P = 0.07) to be more active than L cows. In conclusion, late gestational ear-surface temperatures were associated with some postpartum health disorders and modifications in daily eating, ruminating, and active times during the transition period of gravid heifers and dry cows.

We use the nonextensive Tsallis statistics to find the entropic index in the partonic stages of the relativistic heavy ion collisions. We find that the temperature and the entropic index have a linear relationship during the partonic stages of the heavy ion collision. This has already been observed in the hadronic phase. A detailed analysis of the dependence of the entropic index on the system shows that for increasing spacetime rapidity, the entropic index of the partonic system increases. The entropic index also depends on the beam collision energy. The calculation of the entropic index from the experimental data fitting of the transverse momenta deals with the hadronic phase.

The effect of diurnal temperature variations on model predictions for various assumed vaporization enthalpies, precursor emission rates and primary organic concentrations is explored.

A 10 degreesC decrease in temperature is estimated to increase SOA yields by 20-150%, depending on the assumed vaporization enthalpy. In model simulations, high daytime temperatures tend to reduce SOA concentrations by 16-24%, while cooler nighttime temperatures lead to a 22-34% increase, compared to constant temperature conditions; Results suggest that currently available constant temperature partitioning coefficients do not adequately represent atmospheric SOA partitioning behavior.

Additionally, the hourly distribution of rainfall changed from a relatively small diurnal variability when there was a lake system to a larger variability with a peak in the afternoon when the system was removed. Extreme precipitation events became more intense in the simulations with lakes.

High temperature stress conditions,AGRONOMY JOURNAL,,,,,,,,,,,,"High soil temperatures are a significant constraint to crop establishment, Exposure of preemergent maize (Zea mays L.) to temperatures in excess of 40 degrees C stops shoot elongation and may also damage the seedling, reducing subsequent shoot growth in the physiological temperature range (9 to 40 degrees C). At present, there is little quantitative understanding of the effects of high temperature stress on preemergent maize shoot growth. Consequently, existing maize emergence or preemergent maize shoot growth models are restricted to the physiological temperature range. The work described in this paper quantified the effect of supramaximum temperatures (temperatures greater than 40 degrees C) on maize shoot growth, and in particular on its component parts, the coleoptile and first internode, The major impact of supramaximum temperatures on shoot growth was due to a severe reduction in the first internode growth rate, which was correlated with the maximum temperature reached during the day. We also found that, under diurnally varying temperature conditions, coleoptile growth ceased only at 45 degrees C, rather than at 40 degrees C as found previously in constant temperature experiments. Inhibition of shoot growth due to high temperature damage was alleviated when seedlings were grown in the physiological temperature range for 33 h. Based on these findings, a model was developed that can predict shout growth of seedlings exposed to supramaximum temperatures, The model successfully predicted shoot growth of seedlings exposed to supramaximum temperatures as a part of the diurnal cycle.

The two varieties of smutgrass prevalent in Florida are small smutgrass and giant smutgrass. Laboratory seed germination experiments were conducted on both smutgrass varieties to determine the effect of various environmental factors on germination and emergence. The average germination rate for both varieties was 88% at 30/20 C day/night temperatures. Seed germination for both varieties was greater under simulated temperature flux than at constant temperatures. Seed of both varieties germinated at four simulated Florida temperature fluxes (22/11, 27/15, 33/24, and 29/19 C day/night), although the germination of small smutgrass and giant smutgrass was reduced at 33/24 and 22/11 C, respectively. Germination of small and giant smutgrass under dark conditions was 27 and 53%, respectively. Both smutgrass varieties germinated over a wide range of pH values. Small and giant smutgrass germination was inhibited at water potentials below -0.2 MPa and when small smutgrass seed was placed below the soil surface. Emergence of giant smutgrass seed did not occur below 3 cm. Both smutgrass varieties germinated over a broad range of environmental conditions, indicating their capability of year-round germination; however, germination is only likely to occur under field conditions during the summer growing season when rainfall is prevalent. These results indicate that both species have the ability to germinate over a wide range of environmental conditions but that germination is inhibited by moisture stress and depth of burial. Considering that giant smutgrass prefers higher temperatures than small smutgrass, the advent of rainfall from June through September is conducive for germination.

Diurnal and seasonal variations in gs of the rice canopy were determined using a heat transfer model based on heat flux measurements in irrigated rice fields. Season-long observations from transplanting to maturation of rice plants were conducted to obtain heat flux data in a humid temperate climate at three experimental sites with widely differing cropping seasons in Japan. A double source model was used as the heat transfer model to calculate gs. Seasonal variations in heat fluxes differed for sensible heat and latent heat. Sensible heat flux was smaller and relatively constant within the range -50 to So W m(-2), whereas latent heat flux showed large variations from 0 to 250 W m(-2) throughout the growth period. It was suggested that this would be a common pattern for paddy rice fields in all cropping seasons. Diurnal variation in g(s). showed a common trend in all growth periods with lower values in the morning and evening, and higher values during the midday because of its dependence on solar radiation. The relationship between absorbed solar radiation (S-abs) and g(s) was determined using a Jarvis-type model for each growth period. Maximum values of bulk stomatal conductance (g(Smax)) for saturated S-abs, rapidly decreased from 0.06 to 0.02 m s(-1) between the active tillering and panicle formation stages, and moderately decreased from 0.02 to 0.01 m s(-1) during the ripening stage. This was considered to be due to the change in leaf chlorophyll concentration. Seasonal variation in q(Smax) can be commonly expressed for all cropping seasons using the function of developmental stage (P-S). Using this function, the gs value can be obtained easily at a given developmental stage, which makes it possible to use micrometeorological models in relation to rice phenological development for evaluating important factors, such as water temperature and transpiration, that affect rice production.

Mammals inhabiting the subterranean ecotope can adapt their digging and foraging activity in shallow tunnels temporarily to periods with favourable ambient air and soil temperatures. Moreover, subterranean mammals have the unique opportunity to select for their nests in soil depths with certain, daily and seasonally constant temperatures. Our knowledge on nest temperatures in several species of subterranean mammals is based on measurements of temperatures in empty nests. We can expect, however, that the temperature in an occupied nest is higher (due to the igloo effect). We performed two experiments regarding the temperature preference in five species of African mole-rats (Bathyergidae, Rodentia: Fukomys anselli, E mechowii, E micklemi, Heliophobius argenteocinereus, and Heterocephalus glaber). In a first experiment, the animals were tested pairwise (except for the solitary silvery mole-rats, H. argenteocinereus, that were tested singly) in an apparatus consisting of seven chambers with a temperature gradient ranging between 16 and 37 degrees C (air temperature). While the smaller species ( < 110 g; E anselli, E micklemi, H. glaber) chose chambers with average air temperatures around 29 degrees C, the larger mole-rats rested preferably at lower temperatures of approximately 25.6 degrees C (F. mechowii) and 27.7 degrees C (H. argenteocinereus). A strong negative correlation between body mass and preferred air temperature was detected across species. Thus, the results comply with the surface-volume-rule. Contrary to expectations, temperature preference of naked mole-rats (H. glaber) did not deviate from those of furred small mole-rats, but followed the general trend with smaller species preferring higher temperatures. In a second experiment, Ansell's mole-rats (E anselli) were tested in groups of four, six and nine animals and the preferred temperatures were compared to the values obtained for pairs. The preferred mean air temperatures did not differ among the groups of different sizes. We discuss our finding's in the light of ecophysiological adaptations to cope with the ambient conditions proposed by the thermal stress hypothesis. Furthermore, we suggest that while soil temperature is decisive during digging as the mole-rats warm up or cool due to tight contact between body and soil (conduction), resting animals prevent heat loss through conduction by building a nest.

Applying high-throughput sequencing techniques complemented by quantitative real-time PCR experiments, we demonstrate that altered ambient temperature induces drastic but reversible changes in sequence composition and total abundance of both miRNA and piRNA populations. Further, mRNA sequencing reveals that the expression of miRNAs and their predicted target transcripts correlates inversely, suggesting that temperature-responsive miRNAs drive adaptation to different ambient temperatures on the transcriptome level. Finally, we demonstrate that shifts in temperature affect both primary and secondary piRNA pools, and the observed aberrations are consistent with altered expression levels of the involved Piwi-pathway factors.

Smaller cells speed metabolism during periods of warming but require more energy to maintain and repair. To evaluate this theory, we studied the evolution of cell size in populations of Drosophila melanogaster held at either a constant temperature (16 degrees C or 25 degrees C) or fluctuating temperatures (16 and 25 degrees C). Populations that evolved at fluctuating temperatures or a constant 25 degrees C developed smaller thoraxes, wings, and cells than did flies exposed to a constant 16 degrees C. The cells of flies from fluctuating environments were intermediate in size to those of flies from constant environments. Most genetic variation in cell size was independent of variation in wing size, suggesting that cell size was a target of selection. These evolutionary patterns accord with patterns of developmental plasticity documented previously.

In this paper, a novel SAW radio frequency identification (RFID) enabled temperature sensor is proposed for industrial applications, in which short measurement range but high accuracy is usually required. The encoding scheme for the sensor using pulse positions combined with phase information is adopted, and then the relationship between the length of a time slot and the decoding errors is deduced to ensure the sensor can be accurately identified, even though ambient temperature fluctuates. In order to solve the phase ambiguity problem involved in temperature measurements more efficiently and reduce the cost of obtaining the unwrapping temperature characteristic curves in the calibration process, an analytical procedure for calculating the variation of phase delay differences with respect to temperature has been proposed. A self-developed burst transceiver supporting online data analysis is also presented. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed SAW-RFID enabled temperature sensing scheme, and the prototype sensor within a temperature-controlled oven 2 m away from the center of the transceiver antenna in a horizontal orientation achieves an accuracy of +/-0.3 degrees C in the temperature range 0-40 degrees C.

S. Space Shuttle mission STS-66 in November 1994 provide a variety of zonally symmetric and asymmetric tidal signatures in the altitude range from 40-90 km. The most prominent zonally asymmetric tidal pattern is identified to be the westward propagating nonmigrating diurnal tide of zonal wavenumber 2 (s = -2). This mode has an amplitude of approximately half the amplitude of the migrating (s = -1) component of the diurnal tide. The observational findings are compared to model results from the Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM) and from the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIME-GCM). GSWM and TIME-GCM account for different tidal sources and therefore allow an analysis of the tidal forcing responsible for the observed signatures. The GSWM tidal forcing in the model version used is based upon latent heat release associated with tropical deep convection while nonmigrating tides in the TIME-GCM are predominantly forced by nonlinear interactions between the migrating diurnal tide and stationary planetary waves. It is shown that the latter mechanism forces a large part of the s = -2 mode while the stationary, zonally uniform (s = 0) diurnal nonmigrating tide is mainly driven by latent heat release. This result suggests that dynamical models for the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) region need to account for the tropospheric latent heat source and stationary planetary wave activity in order to predict realistic longitudinal diurnal tidal variability.",,,,,"Hagan, Maura/C-7200-2008","Hagan, Maura/0000-0002-8866-7429; Oberheide, Jens/0000-0001-6721-2540",,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-897X,2169-8996,,,,NOV,2002,107,D21,,,,,,,4567,10.1029/2002JD002220,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002JD002220,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000180860300019,View Full Record in Web of Science

In deep lakes that thermally stratify, M. relicta spends most of the time on or near the lake bottom in cold water where food resources are low; but, M. relicta migrates daily into warmer layers to feed where food resources are more abundant. Hence, in deep lakes M. relicta traverses steep temperature and prey density gradients while migrating through the water column to forage. We conducted a laboratory growth experiment of factorial design that simulated the range of temperatures and densities of natural zooplankton forage encountered by M. relicta during DVM. Somatic growth, measured as change in total length and lipid-free biomass, was not significantly different among experimental treatments. Analysis of variance showed that M. relicta stored energy in the form of lipid instead of using the energy mainly to drive increased somatic growth, but only at the colder temperatures. Lipid storage was 24% (+/- 4.3 sd) in 4 degrees C-high forage treatment compared to 6% (+/- 1.1) at 14 degrees C-high forage treatment. Energy conversion efficiency (ECE) of M. relicta was highest (21.3% +/- 5.8) at 4 degrees C and lowest (3.3% +/- 0.9) at 14 degrees C, regardless of prey density. The experiment showed that Mysis relicta feeds at high food densities where ECE is low, but spends most of the time in colder water where ECE is high. These results support McLaren's metabolic efficiency hypothesis, which predicts that feeding in the more productive surface waters and then migrating to colder waters is reproductively advantageous. Moreover, owing to high metabolic efficiency in the coldest waters and rapid DVM, M. relicta is able to sequester much of the epilimnetic zooplankton production near or on the lake bottom, thereby forcing the lake food web toward a configuration dominated by mysids, benthic or deepwater fishes and small, agile zooplankton.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0018-8158,,,,,,1999,412,,,,,,155,164,,10.1023/A:1003886920400,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003886920400,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000084827100017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accurate estimation of T-s at various soil depths is crucial for land-atmosphere interactions. This study investigated the applicability of four different machine learning models, extreme learning machine (ELM), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) and random forests (RF), for modeling half-hourly T-s at four different depths of 2 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm on the Loess Plateau of China. A field experiment was conducted to measure half-hourly T-s and meteorological variables. Air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, solar radiation, and vapor pressure deficit were used as inputs to train the models for estimation of half-hourly T-s. The results showed ELM, GRNN, BPNN and RF models provided desirable performance in modeling half-hourly T-s at all depths, with root mean square error values ranging 2.26-2.95, 2.36-3.10, 2.32-3.04 and 2.31-3.00 degrees C, mean absolute error values ranging 1.76-2.26, 1.83-2.31, 1.80-2.32 and 1.79-2.26 degrees C, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient values ranging 0.856-0.930, 0.841-0.924, 0.847-0.927 and 0.850-0.927, and concordance correlation coefficient values ranging 0.925-0.965, 0.925-0.963, 0.928-0.963, and 0.924-0.961 for the ELM, GRNN, BPNN, and RF models, respectively.

The onion fly Delia antiqua (Meigen) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), which pupates at a soil depth of 2-20 cm, advances the eclosion phase of its circadian rhythm as the temperature amplitude decreases. This 'temperature amplitude response' is considered to allow pupae located at any depth to eclose in the early morning. The present study examines the temperature amplitude response of D. antiqua under thermoperiods with amplitudes ranging between 1 and 20 degrees C. The thermoperiod to which pupae are exposed is either a square-wave temperature cycle, which is generally used for laboratory experiments, or a pseudo-sinusoidal temperature cycle, which more closely resembles natural daily temperature cycle, at an average temperature of either 25 or 20 degrees C. Bursts of eclosion invoked by the abrupt temperature increase in square-wave cycles are apparently repressed in pseudo-sinusoidal temperature cycles. Eclosion time shows a clear quantitative shift by 5.9-8.6 h in response to temperature amplitude regardless of the average temperature and the shape of the temperature cycle. The change in the eclosion time is clearly noticeable between amplitudes of 1 and 8 degrees C but is small between amplitudes of 8 degrees C or more.

The cardinal temperature for B. bassiana conidial germination and hyphal development was approximately 35 degrees C. A low prevalence of mycosis (less than or equal to 7%) was observed in inoculated nymphs exposed to a continuous temperature of 35 and 40 degrees C, whereas continuous exposure to 30 degrees C did not have a significant effect on disease development. Daily exposures to 35 and 40 degrees C for 1 and 6 h, respectively, decreased mycosis in nymphs. In both environments, a strong correlation (r greater than or equal to 0.95) was observed between hyphal growth on potato dextrose agar and final mycosis, Although high temperatures delayed conidial germination, only conidia exposed to continuous 35 or to 40 degrees C for more than 8 h exhibited reduced germination after 24 h, The effects of temperature on conidial germination were poorly correlated with disease, and when nymphs were exposed to 35 degrees C for 24 h, less mycosis was observed only in grasshoppers exposed between 1 and 2 days postinoculation. The thoracic temperature of nymphs permitted to bask adjacent to a heat source ranged from 38 to 42 degrees C, In nymphs basking for 1 h per day, 46% less mycosis was observed, decreasing to 98% less disease in nymphs allowed to bask for 6 h or greater per day. On a heat gradient, a higher prevalence of B. bassiana-infected nymphs selected hotter positions than noninfected nymphs, suggesting a ''behavioral fever'' response to infection. This study indicates that high temperature and thermoregulation can adversely affect B. bassiana mycosis of grasshoppers and may explain the poor efficacy of this entomopathogen observed in some held experiments.

The screens are currently in use throughout the world and comprise the following types: an aspirated Young screen, four naturally ventilated round-shaped multi-plate screens (KNMI, Vaisala, Young, Socrima), a slightly aspirated version of the KNMI screen, a synthetic Stevenson screen (both aspirated and naturally ventilated) and a naturally ventilated wooden Stevenson screen. The multi-plate KNMI screen served as a reference. For the daily minimum, maximum, and mean air temperatures (T(n), T(x), T(mean)), the absolute seasonal mean differences with the reference were almost all <= 0.1 degrees C. An exception is the aspirated Young screen for which differences in mean T(x) in summer (JJA) are most notable and amount to -0.43 degrees C. The differences of the individual T(n), T(x), T(mean) values may be much larger than their seasonal averages. For the aspirated Young and the naturally ventilated Stevenson screens they are most notable, where the Young is generally cooler (T(x) and T(mean)) and the Stevensons warmer than the reference. The absolute temperature differences between the screens and the reference are shown to increase with decreasing cloud cover and windspeed. Furthermore, using the original 15-s samples it is shown that random variations cause fast-responding screens to have more extreme T(n), T(x) values than slow-responding screens. For a supposed transition of the natural ventilated synthetic Stevenson screen to the reference screen, transfer functions are successfully developed for the 10-min temperature data and the daily T(n) and T(x) data. It is argued that the explained variance of the models could have further improved when high-accuracy (especially in the range 0-3 m/s) windspeed measurements were available (at screen level and position).

The goal was to investigate the stabilities and phase transition pathways of Mg-sulfate hydrates, under temperature and relative humidity conditions relevant to Mars, as a function of starting structure and coexisting species. Two pathways were found to form Mg-sulfate monohydrates between 5 degrees C and 50 degrees C through dehydration of epsomite or hexahydrite. Two polymorphs of Mg-sulfate monohydrates were characterized in this study. It is important to distinguish among these phases on Mars because they have different formation conditions that have the potential to provide additional information on surface and subsurface geologic processes. We found that Mg-sulfates with moderate hydration states (especially starkeyite and amorphous Mg-sulfates) can be very stable under current Martian surface conditions. On the basis of NIR spectral features, these phases are good candidates for polyhydrated sulfates identified on Mars by OMEGA and CRISM; thus, they may contribute to the high hydrogen concentrations found by the neutron spectrometer on the orbiting Odyssey spacecraft. Our experiments indicate that the maximum number of water molecules per SO4 held by the amorphous Mg-sulfate structure is three. In addition, the amorphization rate of Mg-sulfates is strongly dependent on temperature. The low temperature (approximately -80 degrees C) in the early morning hours during the Martian diurnal cycle would slow the dehydration rate, which would favor the stability of starkeyite over amorphous Mg-sulfates and would lead to a low abundance of the latter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2169-9097,2169-9100,,,,APR 25,2009,114,,,,,,,,E04010,10.1029/2008JE003266,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JE003266,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000265537700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents an experimental investigation of these effects in typical environmental conditions that exist in construction applications. A total of 117 small specimens were cut from metal-faced sandwich panels with EPS core and were exposed to different numbers of thermal cycles and/or sustained high temperatures. The specimens were then loaded under compression, tension, and four-point bending for evaluating the degradation of the mechanical properties of the foam. The thermal cycles reflect typical surface temperature during daily summer conditions, with a period of 24 h each and with a temperature varying between 24 degrees C to 80 degrees C. The results show that the modulus of elasticity of EPS foam in compression reduced by about 38% after exposure to thermal cycles for 45 days, whereas the tensile and shear moduli reduced by about 5.7% and 13.8%, respectively. Exposure to sustained high temperature after thermal cycles led to larger degradation of the elastic and shear moduli in the range of 38%-50%. These degradations can lead to early failures in applications that rely on the EPS foam as a structural component like in insulating sandwich panels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1099-6362,1530-7972,,,,MAR,2022,24,3,,,,,1535,1555,1.09964E+16,10.1177/10996362211063152,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10996362211063152,,DEC 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000738781600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

FITNESS RESPONSES OF ESCHERICHIA-COLI TO CHANGES IN ITS THERMAL ENVIRONMENT,EVOLUTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"We used bacteria to study experimentally the process of genetic adaptation to environmental temperature. Replicate lines of Escherichia coli, founded from a common ancestor, were propagated for 2,000 generations in 4 different thermal regimes as 4 experimental groups: constant 32, 37, or 42-degrees-C (thermal specialists), or a daily alternation between 32 and 42-degrees-C (32/42-degrees-C: thermal generalists). The ancestor had previously been propagated at 37-degrees-C for 2,000 generations. Adaptation of the groups to temperature was measured by improvement in fitness relative to the ancestor, as estimated by competition experiments. All four experimental groups showed improved relative fitness in their own thermal environment (direct response of fitness). However, rates of fitness improvement varied greatly among temperature groups. The 42-degrees-C group responded most rapidly and extensively, followed by the 32 and 32/42-degrees-C groups, whose fitness improvements were indistinguishable. The 37-degrees-C group, which experienced the ancestral temperature, had the slowest and least extensive fitness improvement. The correlated fitness responses of each group, again relative to the common ancestor, were measured over the entire experimental range of temperatures. No necessary tradeoff between direct and correlated responses of fitness was apparent: for example, the improved fitness of the 42-degrees-C group at 42-degrees-C was not accompanied by a loss of fitness at 37-degrees-C or 32-degrees-C. However, the direct fitness responses were usually greater than the correlated responses, judged both by comparing direct and correlated responses of a single group at different temperatures and by comparing direct and correlated responses of different groups at a single temperature. These comparisons indicate that the observed adaptation was, in fact, largely temperature specific. Also, the fitness responses of the generalist group across a range of temperatures were less variable than those of the thermal specialist groups considered as whole.",,,,,,"Lenski, Richard/0000-0002-1064-8375",,,,,,,,,,,,,0014-3820,1558-5646,,,,FEB,1992,46,1,,,,,16,30,,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1992.tb01981.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1992.tb01981.x,,,,,,,,28564952,,,,,WOS:A1992HD99300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Air temperature fluctuations in the exposed head space of the tensiometer can cause large air pressure changes leading to misinterpretation of the soil water potential. Treating the tensiometer head space as an ideal gas with water vapor in dynamic equilibrium, a set of coupled equations is derived that describes the relationship between head space air pressure, the rate of temperature change, the conductance of the tensiometer cup, and the head space volume. The interaction of these factors is illustrated through a series of simulations and then demonstrated with laboratory and field experiments. Air pressure deviations as large as +/-80% were observed in tensiometers of low cup conductance and large head space when exposed to rapid temperature change. When the temperature change is slow relative to the cup conductance, changes in air-pocket pressure are corrected by water now across the cup, and interpretation errors are small, Air pressure deviations from both rapid and slow temperature change may be estimated with the simulation equations using an approximation for the water pressure gradient across the tensiometer cup. The most practical outcome of this research is the theoretical and experimental confirmation that air temperature effects are reduced by maintaining high water levels in the tensiometer (that is, minimizing the air-pocket volume) and by maximizing the tensiometer cup conductance. In the field, insulating or shading tensiometers reduces temperature-related errors in general but may aggravate the problem if removal of the insulation (as might be necessary to read the tensiometer) causes a sudden temperature change in the air-pocket.",,,,,"Cardon, Grant/O-4863-2014",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0038-075X,,,,,SEP,1998,163,9,,,,,677,685,,10.1097/00010694-199809000-00001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-199809000-00001,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000076172700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Other variations have been attributed to seasonal or other effects, but the effects of variations in the thermospheric temperature have not previously been analysed in detail. We present results from a study of the propagation of gravity waves through a layered atmosphere in which the thermospheric wind and temperature are derived from a three-dimensional time-dependent model. The analysis has been carried out for a range of wave speeds and periods, and for a range of times, seasons and propagation azimuths. Results suggest that a significant diurnal variation in the transmission coefficient for waves propagating through the thermosphere exists with seasonally dependent maxima. Transmission increases for increasing Wave period up to about 50 min, after which it remains approximately constant. Maximum transmission occurs for wave phase speeds around 200-250 m/s and falls to zero for speeds less than about 100 m/s. An exception to this rule occurs for waves with periods less than 40 min and speeds less than 50 m/s for which significant transmission appears to be theoretically possible.

Adaptation of Escherichia coli at a niche boundary,EVOLUTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Following an environmental change, the course of a population's adaptive evolution may be influenced by environmental factors, such as the degree of marginality of the new environment relative to the organism's potential range, and by genetic factors, including constraints that may have arisen during its past history. Experimental populations of bacteria were used to address these issues in the context of evolutionary adaptation to the thermal environment. Six replicate lines of Escherichia coli (20 degrees C group), founded from a common ancestor, were propagated for 2000 generations at 20 degrees C, a novel temperature that is very near the lower thermal limit at which it can maintain a stable population size in a daily serial transfer (100-fold dilution) regime. Four additional groups (32/20, 37/20, 42/20, and 32-42/20 degrees C groups) of six lines, each with 2000 generation selection histories at different temperatures (32, 37, 42, and daily alternation of 32 and 42 degrees C), were moved to the same 20 degrees C environment and propagated in parallel to ascertain whether selection histories influence the adaptive response in this novel environment. Adaptation was measured by improvement in fitness relative to the common ancestor in direct competition experiments conducted at 20 degrees C. All five groups showed improvement in relative fitness in this environment; the mean fitness of the 20 degrees C group after 2000 generations increased by about 8%. Selection history had no discernible effect on the rate or final magnitude of the fitness responses of the four groups with different histories after 2000 generations. The correlated fitness responses of the 20 degrees C group were measured across the entire thermal niche. There were significant tradeoffs in fitness at higher temperatures; for example, at 40 degrees C the average fitness of the 20 degrees C group was reduced by almost 20% relative to the common ancestor. We also observed a downward shift of 1-2 degrees C in both the upper and lower thermal niche limits for the 20 degrees C selected group. These observations are contrasted with previous observations of a markedly greater rate of adaptation to growth near the upper thermal limit (42 degrees C) and a lack of trade-off in fitness at lower temperatures for lines adapted to that high temperature.

J,"Fritze, H",,,,"Fritze, Holger",,,High-temperature piezoelectric crystals and devices,JOURNAL OF ELECTROCERAMICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Conventional piezoelectric materials such as quartz are widely used as high precision transducers and sensors based on bulk acoustic waves. However, their operation temperature is limited by the intrinsic materials properties to about 500A degrees C. High-temperature applications are feasible by applying materials that retain their piezoelectric properties up to higher temperatures. Here, langasite (La3Ga5SiO14) and compounds of the langasite family are the most promising candidates, since they are shown to exhibit bulk acoustic waves up to at least 1400A degrees C. The mass sensitivity of langasite resonators at elevated temperatures is about as high as that of quartz at room temperature. Factors limiting potential use of those crystals include excessive conductive and viscous losses, deviations from stoichiometry and chemical instability. Therefore, the objective of this work is to identify the related microscopic mechanisms, to correlate electromechanical properties and defect chemistry and to improve the stability of the materials by e.g. appropriate dopants. Further application examples such as resonant gas sensors are given to demonstrate the capabilities of high-temperature stable piezoelectric materials. The electromechanical properties of langasite are determined and described by a one-dimensional physical model. Key properties relevant for stable operation of resonators are found to be shear modulus, density, electrical conductivity and effective viscosity. In order to quantify their impact on frequency and damping, a generalized Sauerbrey equation is given. Mass and charge transport in single crystalline langasite are correlated with langasite's defect chemistry and electromechanical properties. First of all, the dominant charge carriers are identified. Undoped langasite shows predominant ionic conduction at elevated temperatures. As long as the atmosphere is nearly hydrogen-free, the transport is governed by oxygen movement. A dominant role of hydrogen is observed in hydrogenous atmospheres since the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen is orders of magnitude higher than that of oxygen. The loss in langasite is found to be governed up to about 650A degrees C by viscoelastic damping related to the above mentioned movement of oxygen ions. Donor doping is shown to lower the loss contribution. Above 650A degrees C the impact of the conductivity related loss becomes pronounced. Here, lowering the conductivity results generally in decreased losses. The evaluation of langasite's applicability is focused on mapping the regimes of gas insensitive operation. The most relevant feature with respect to frequency fluctuations of resonator devices is the formation of oxygen vacancies. In nominally hydrogen free atmospheres the calculated frequency shift becomes pronounced below oxygen partial pressures of 10 (-aEuro parts per thousand 17), 10 (-aEuro parts per thousand 24) and 10 (-aEuro parts per thousand 36) bar at 1000, 800 and 600A degrees C, respectively. Water vapor is found to shift the resonance frequency at higher oxygen partial pressures. In the hydrogen containing atmospheres applied here, langasite can be regarded as a stable resonator material above 10 (-aEuro parts per thousand 13) bar and 10 (-aEuro parts per thousand 20) bar at 800 and 600A degrees C, respectively. The incorporation of OH-groups determines the frequency shift.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1385-3449,1573-8663,,,,JUN,2011,26,1-4,,,,,122,161,,10.1007/s10832-011-9639-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10832-011-9639-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000291488200020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Respiration decreased at marine salinities in P. marina, and increased in both species at oligohaline salinities down to a stress-induced maximum around a salinity of 5 parts per thousand, then steeply declined towards freshwater conditions. Temperature heavily affected both species, but Q(10)-values in D. meyli were considerably higher than in P. marina, suggesting the former species to be particularly well adapted to fine-tuning its energy expenditure as a function of temperature. The highest respiration and assimilation rates in both species were at 25 degrees C. At still higher temperatures, metabolic rates were depressed, but while P. marina was entirely inactivated above 30 degrees C, D. meyli continued to respire and assimilate food up to 35 degrees C. The scope for production, calculated as the net difference between assimilation and respiration rates (both expressed in units of C), was 0 at 5 degrees C and increased to a maximum at 25 degrees C in both nematodes; it declined at higher temperatures, but remained positive up to 35 degrees C in D. meyli. Significant food assimilation in both nematodes occurred only at bacterial densities above 10(8) cells ml(-1). Assimilation rate reached a maximum at 5 x 10(8) cells ml(-1) in D. meyli, and remained constant at higher densities. P. marina, by contrast, had a well defined peak assimilation at a food density of 2.5 x 10(9) cells ml(-1), with lower rates at both lower and higher food densities. This contrasts with observations on ingestion rate, and suggests a food density-dependent assimilation efficiency. The present results suggest that tolerances of exposure to salinity and temperature extremes on a daily rather than seasonal basis, may be of higher significance in niche differentiation between both species. Their fundamental niche further appears to be determined by the range of (near) optimal food conditions, which is narrow in P. marina but comparatively broader in D. meyli.

Molecular understanding of how noisy temperature cues are registered has emerged from dissection of vernalization in Arabidopsis, which involves a multiphase cold-dependent silencing of the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Cold-induced transcriptional silencing precedes a low probability PRC2 epigenetic switching mechanism. The epigenetic switch requires the absence of warm temperatures as well as long-term cold exposure. However, the natural temperature inputs into the earlier transcriptional silencing phase are less well understood. Here, through investigation of Arabidopsis accessions in natural and climatically distinct field sites, we show that the first seasonal frost strongly induces expression of COOLAIR, the antisense transcripts at FLC. Chamber experiments delivering a constant mean temperature with different fluctuations showed the freezing induction of COOLAIR correlates with stronger repression of FLC mRNA. Identification of a mutant that ectopically activates COOLAIR revealed how COOLAIR up-regulation can directly reduce FLC expression. Consistent with this, transgenes designed to knockout COOLAIR perturbed the early phase of FLC silencing. However, all transgenes designed to remove COOLAIR resulted in increased production of novel convergent FLC antisense transcripts. Our study reveals how natural temperature fluctuations promote COOLAIR regulation of FLC, with the first autumn frost acting as a key indicator of autumn/winter arrival.",,,,,"Antoniou-Kourounioti, Rea Laila/AAY-3284-2020","Antoniou-Kourounioti, Rea Laila/0000-0001-5226-521X; Bloomer, Rebecca/0000-0002-0902-1807; Xu, Congyao/0000-0001-6378-8534; Dean, Caroline/0000-0002-6555-3525; Zhao, Yusheng/0000-0002-5893-504X; Zhu, Pan/0000-0003-0029-3571; Hepworth, Jo/0000-0002-4621-8414",,,,,,,,,,,,,0890-9369,1549-5477,,,,JUN,2021,35,11-12,,,,,,,,10.1101/gad.348362.121,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gad.348362.121,,,,,,,,33985972,,,,,WOS:000656911500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We have analyzed the changes in resource use by subordinate species in plots with different abundances of dominant ants, and in different periods of the day and the year, i.e., at different temperatures. The expected effects of competition by dominant species on foraging of subordinates were only detected for two species in the number of baits occupied per day, and for one species in the number of foragers at pitfall traps. In all three cases, subordinate species were less represented at baits or in traps in plots with a high density of dominants than in plots with a medium or low density of dominants. The number of workers per bait, and the foraging efficiency of subordinate species did not differ in plots differing in dominant abundance. Daily activity rhythms and curves of temperature versus foraging activity of subordinate species were also similar in plots with different abundance of dominant species, indicating no effect of dominants on the foraging times of subordinates. Instead, temperature had a considerable effect on the foraging of subordinate species. A significant relationship was found between maximum daily temperature and several variables related to foraging (the number of foragers at pitfall traps, the number of baits occupied per day, and the number of workers per bait) of a number subordinate species, both in summer and autumn. These results suggest that the foraging of subordinate ant species in open Mediterranean habitats is influenced more by temperature than by competition of dominants, although an effect of dominants on subordinates has been shown in a few cases. In ant communities living in these severe and variable environments, thermal tolerance reduces the importance of competition, and the mutual exclusion usually found between dominant and subordinate species appears to be the result of physiological specialization to different temperature ranges.",,,,,"Cerda, Xim/P-6461-2014; Manzaneda, Antonio/AAG-1776-2019; Retana, Javier/L-1214-2014","Cerda, Xim/0000-0002-3222-2471; Manzaneda Avila, Antonio Jose/0000-0001-9384-7910; Retana, Javier/0000-0002-7505-9467",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,DEC,1998,117,3,,,,,404,412,,10.1007/s004420050674,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050674,,,,,,,,28307920,,,,,WOS:000077666300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gastric evacuation followed an exponential pattern and was influenced by food type; phytoplankton was evacuated at a much faster rate than zooplankton. Estimated gastric evacuation rates ranged between 0.05 and 0.29.h(-1), with mean values of 0.09 and 0.27.h(-1) for fish fed zooplankton and phytoplankton respectively. Despite this large range, no significant relationships were found between gastric evacuation rate and fish size, temperature, food particle size or meal size. Feeding periodicity was size-dependent; small fish had a peak in feeding activity at or around sunset, whereas larger fish appeared to feed continuously. This suggests that fish of different size exhibit different foraging behaviours, possibly reflecting differences in their diets.

In the first experiment, the PZ1 larvae at the lowest temperature of 22 degrees C showed the highest survival (69%) to PL1 compared to 61% at 26 degrees C, 44% at 30 degrees C and 12% at 34 degrees C. However, 22 degrees C slowed the growth and delayed the larval development by about 2-4 days. Growth rate at 30 degrees C (0.44-0.48 mm day(-1)) was double of that (0.22-0.25 mm day(-1)) at 22 degrees C. The results showed that P. semisulcatus is tolerant to low, rather than to high temperatures during the larval development. Hence, a water temperature; level of about 30 degrees C is optimal for the larval culture of this species. The second experiment showed that temperature exerted a greater influence than the salinity on the growth and survival during the larval development. The range of temperature in which the larvae showed high survival and growth is relatively narrow as compared to that of salinity. At all salinity levels, survival to PL1 (69-77%) was higher at 26 degrees C as compared to 30 degrees C (44-73%) and 34 degrees C (14-21 degrees), However, daily growth rate at 30 degrees C and 34 degrees C was about 60% higher than at 26 degrees C.

Contrary to previous studies in which satellite products were used to derive monthly climatologies, a daily surface (snow free) albedo is analyzed by a Kalman filter. The filter combines optimally a satellite product derived from the Meteosat Second Generation geostationary satellite [and produced by the Land Surface Analyses-Satellite Application Facility of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT)], an albedo climatology, and a priori information given by persistence. The surface albedo analyzed for a given day is used as boundary conditions of the NWP model to run forecasts starting the following day. Results from short-range forecasts over a 1-yr period reveal the capacity of satellite information to reduce model biases and RMSE in screen-level temperature (during daytime and intermediate seasons). The impact on forecast scores is larger when considering the analyzed surface albedo rather than another climatologically based albedo product. From comparisons with measurements from three flux-tower stations over mostly homogeneous French forests, it is seen that the model biases in surface net radiation are significantly reduced. An impact on the whole planetary boundary layer, particularly in summer, results from the use of an observed surface albedo. An unexpected behavior produced in summer by the satellite-derived albedo on surface temperature is also explained. The forecast runs presented here, performed in dynamical adaptation mode, will be complemented later on by data assimilation experiments over typically monthly periods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1558-8424,1558-8432,,,,OCT,2012,51,10,,,,,1835,1854,,10.1175/JAMC-D-11-0163.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-11-0163.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000310359200009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we focus on daily maximum temperatures, while holding night-time temperatures constant, to specifically investigate the effects of high temperature on demographic parameters and fitness in the English grain aphid Sitobion avenae. We then compared the observed effects of different daily maximum temperatures with predictions from constant temperature-performance expectations. Moderate daily maximum temperatures depressed aphid performance while extreme conditions had dramatic effects, even when mean temperatures were below the critical maximum. Predictions based on daily average temperature underestimated negative effects of temperature on performance by ignoring daily maximum temperature, while predictions based on daytime maximum temperatures overestimated detrimental impacts by ignoring recovery under mild night-time temperatures. Our findings suggest that daily maximum temperature will play an important role in regulating natural population dynamics and should be considered in predictions. These findings have implications for natural population dynamics, particularly when considering the expected increase in extreme temperature events under climate change.",,,,,"Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011; Ma, Chun-Sen/K-5414-2019; Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019","Ma, Chun-Sen/0000-0002-3253-6921; Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645; Ma, Gang/0000-0002-3378-9488",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUL,2015,218,14,,,,,2289,2296,,10.1242/jeb.122127,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.122127,,,,,,,,26026043,,,,,WOS:000358301300023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Biochar has been shown to increase, decrease, or have no e ff ect on the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from soil, depending on the specific soil and biochar characteristics. However, the temperature sensitivity of these gas emissions in biochar-amended soils is still poorly investigated. Background and Objectives: A pot experiment was set up to investigate the impact of woodchips biochar on the temperature sensitivity of the main GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions from soil. Materials and Methods: Nine pots (14 L volume) were filled with soil mixed with biochar at two application rates (0.021 kg of biochar /kg of soil and 0.042 kg of biochar /kg of soil) or with soil alone as the control (three pots per treatment). Pots were incubated in a growth chamber and the emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O were monitored for two weeks with a cavity ring-down gas analyzer connected to three closed dynamic chambers. The temperature in the chamber increased from 10 ffi C to 30 ffi C during the first week and decreased back to 10 ffi C during the second week, with a daily change of 5 ffi C. Soil water content was kept at 20% (w /w). Results: Biochar application did not significantly a ff ect the temperature sensitivity of CO2 and N2O emissions. However, the sensitivity of CH4 uptake from soil significantly decreased by the application of biochar, reducing the CH4 soil consumption compared to the un-amended soil, especially at high soil temperatures. Basal CO2 respiration at 10 ffi C was significantly higher in the highest biochar application rate compared to the control soil. Conclusions: These results confirmed that the magnitude and direction of the influence of biochar on temperature sensitivity of GHG emissions depend on the specific GHG considered. The biochar tested in this study did not a ff ect soil N2O emission and only marginally a ff ected CO2 emission in a wide range of soil temperatures. However, it showed a negative impact on soil CH4 uptake, particularly at a high temperature, having important implications in a future warmer climate scenario and at higher application rates.",,,,,"Ventura, Maurizio/AAR-8486-2020; Panzacchi, Pietro/AAF-3193-2020","Panzacchi, Pietro/0000-0002-3749-1590; Tonon, Giustino/0000-0002-4851-0662",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1999-4907,,,,JUL,2019,10,7,,,,,,,594,10.3390/f10070594,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10070594,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000482080800064,View Full Record in Web of Science

The amplitude ratio and phase difference between diurnal surface tides and diurnal isotherm fluctuations changed considerably between pronounced internal wave episodes, depending on stratification properties, thus suggesting possible resonant excitation of internal oscillations. On the contrary, no significant diurnal thermocline fluctuations were observed at two other islands (Bisevo and Susac). Theoretical analysis presented here focused on the trapping of long-period internal waves around a circular island corresponding to Lastovo and confirmed that stratification properties during the summer of 2006 around the island were close to resonant ones. The analysis also showed that Bisevo and Susac are too small to support diurnal near-resonant excitation. Application of a numerical model for the current flow around equivalent circular and elliptical islands in the stratified sea provided more details on resonant excitation. Theoretical and numerical modeling results particularly emphasized the importance of island dimensions, stratification properties (pyconocline depth and density defect) and the periodicity of the forcing. Furthermore, idealized numerical simulations demonstrated that the waves trapped at Lastovo behave as the gravest azimuthal mode of internal Kelvin-like waves, revolving in a clockwise direction around the island, and that the eccentricity of the island has almost no effect on the resonant period.

Given the limited data required, such a model could replace the standard approach (ET0 x K-c) for calculating olive water requirements, enhancing the precision of estimates. We developed a specific model of daily gc for unstressed olive canopies that was calibrated by transpiration measurements obtained by water balance from a 2-year experiment in a mature orchard with lambda E-p ranging from 0.6 (February 1993) to 11.5 (July 1994) MJ m(-2) day(-1) and where leaf area index (L) changed from 1.25 to 2.5. The model uses the intercepted fraction of daily PAR and a linear function of average daytime temperature. The model was validated with lambda E-p data collected by eddy covariance in a 3-year experiment conducted in a growing orchard that differed in L and cultivar from the one used in the calibration. The g(c) model, when used in the Penman-Monteith equation, gave very good daily lambda E-p predictions for all seasons during 3 years, ranging from 0.5 (November 1998) to 5.5 (June 2000) MJm(-2) day(-1), indicating that the goals of dealing with the dependence of olive gc on L and of simulating the seasonal variations in gc were achieved. A comparison with the Jarvis gc model, calibrated with 2 months of measured gc hourly data, showed that the gc model developed here performed better than the Jarvis model for the 3-year dataset. The exception to this was the period in which the Jarvis model was calibrated. This indicates that (1) the Jarvis model did not account for the seasonal variations in gc of the olive trees; and (2) the spatial and temporal scale assumptions required in the calibration of gc generate seasonal errors in the simulated bulk daily lambda E-p for this crop. The applicability of this bulk gc model is restricted to well watered olive canopies and to the one-layer approach of calculating lambda E-p but it could be adapted to rain-fed canopies in the future.",,,,,"Testi, Luca/AAO-1826-2020; Fereres, Elias/R-4451-2019; Testi, Luca/H-4626-2015; Villalobos, Francisco J/H-1364-2012","Testi, Luca/0000-0002-8728-7563; Testi, Luca/0000-0002-8728-7563; Villalobos, Francisco J/0000-0002-0990-2970; Orgaz, Francisco/0000-0002-5567-6193",,,,,,,,,,,,,1445-4408,1445-4416,,,,,2007,34,3,,,,,178,188,,10.1071/FP06306,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP06306,,,,,,,,32689344,,,,,WOS:000245086000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because natural PFD is highly variable and daylength changes confound seasonal temperature cycles, it is easier to interpret factorial experiments in controlled laboratory conditions. Clonal Ulva rotundata Blid. (Chlorophyta) has been studied extensively in outdoor culture. In this study it was maintained indoors under square wave photoperiods at five PFDs and three temperatures. Growth rate, photosynthetic light response (P-I) curves, and photosystem II chlorophyll fluorescence properties were measured at the growth temperature following acclimation. Interactions between PFD and growth temperature were strongly indicated in all physiological parameters measured. Greatest PFD response occurred at the highest temperature, and the largest temperature response occurred at the highest PFD. Light-saturated photosynthesis (P(m), dark respiration (R(d)), and light-limited quantum yield (phi(m)) were sufficient to describe acclimation status. The light-saturation parameter (I(k)) was redundant and potentially misleading. Although U. rotundata exhibits a great amplitude of photoacclimation, it apparently has little capacity for temperature acclimation compared to the kelp, Laminaria saccharina,for which published data indicate similar photosynthetic rates over a broad range of growth temperatures. Diurnal variation of P(m) and R(d) at a growth PFD of almost-equal-to 1700 +/- 200 mumol photons.m-2.s-1 was similar to the pattern observed previously in outdoor culture, suggesting endogenous control of these parameters. Quantum yield and the ratio of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence (F(v)/F(m)), which were depressed in midday sunlight exceeding almost-equal-to 1500 mumol photons.m-2.s-1, Were relatively invariant through the day in indoor culture, indicating that these parameters are controlled primarily by instantaneous PFD.

Future (2006-49) temperature trends under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios are projected based on the optimal bias correction and ensemble averaging method. Results show the following: (1) The driving global climate model and RCMs can capture the spatial pattern of annual average temperature but with cold biases over most regions, especially in the Tibetan Plateau region. (2) All bias correction methods can significantly reduce the simulation biases.

Ninety-six weaned rabbits were used, half from the Botucatu genetic group and half crossbreds (New Zealand White males x Botucatu females). They were assigned to a completely randomized design in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement (two genetic groups and three ambient temperatures) with repeated measures (weeks). Colonic temperature, skin surface temperature, ear surface temperature, and respiratory rate were recorded from 42 to 67 days of age, whereas body weight and feed intake were recorded from 35 to 70 days of age. Average ambient temperature and relative humidity in the environmental chambers were 18.4 degrees C and 63.9% (thermoneutral), 24.4 degrees C and 80.2% (moderate heat stress) and 29.6 degrees C and 75.9% (intense heat stress). Mean colonic temperatures ranged from 39.4 to 39.7 degrees C across treatments. Botucatu rabbits showed higher (P<0.05) skin surface temperature under moderate heat stress than the crossbreds (33.0 +/- 0.1 vs. 32.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C, respectively) and higher (P<0.01) respiratory rates independently of ambient temperature (161.4 +/- 2.8 vs. 148.1 +/- 2.8 breaths/min, respectively) than the crossbreds. Skin surface temperature, ear surface temperature and respiratory rate were positively related to ambient temperature. Under intense heat, average daily gain of Botucatu rabbits was higher (P<0.05) than that of the crossbreds (33.72 +/- 0.90 vs. 30.66 +/- 0.96 g/day, respectively), but there was no difference with thermoneutral or moderate heat conditions. This finding characterizes a genotype x environment interaction. When the age effect was considered, an increase in colonic temperature under intense heat was detected over the last week. Respiratory rate increased in both genetic groups from six to eight weeks of age, but the increase was more pronounced in Botucatu rabbits than in crossbreds, and the difference between groups was consistently amplified over weeks. Intense heat severely depressed average daily gain as age advanced, especially beyond week eight. As expected, feed consumption increased during the experimental period, but the rate was inversely proportional to ambient temperature. Under intense heat stress, feed consumption of Botucatu rabbits was slightly, but consistently, higher than that of the crossbreds as age advanced. Relevant differences in physiological responses and growth performance between rabbit genetic groups under heat stress were detected. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Whether data resulting from constant-temperature experiments accurately predicts temperature effects under more natural fluctuating temperature regimes remains uncertain. To address such possibility, we measured the resting metabolic rates of the South American rattlesnakes (Crotalus durissus) under constant and circadian fluctuating thermal regimes in a range of temperatures. Metabolic rates measured at constant 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C did not differ from the rates measured at fluctuating regimes with corresponding mean temperatures. However, the difference between thermal regimes increased with temperature, with the metabolic rate measured at constant 30 degrees C being greater than that measured at the fluctuating thermal regime with corresponding mean temperature. Therefore, our results indicate that thermal regime effects on rattlesnakes' metabolism is dependent on temperature range.

This analysis is concerned With acoustic coupling experienced in high frequency instabilities. Experiments carried out on a Multiple injector combustor (MIC) operating Willi liquid oxygen and gaseous methane are used to simulate oil a model scale the situation prevailing in a liquid rocket thrust chamber. External acoustic modulations are generated by periodically blocking an auxiliary nozzle Willi a rotating toothed wheel. By continuously changing the rotation velocity, it is possible to apply a linear frequency sweep and obtain the response of the system to all external excitation. It is found that the chamber quality factor under hot fire conditions is reduced with respect to the one measured under cold flow conditions. This is shown to be correlated With the level and spatial extension of temperature fluctuations inside the chamber. Temperature fluctuations induce variations in the speed of sound Which in turn Perturb the eigenfrequencies of the system and modify its response. This effect is modeled in a simplified way by considering a second order dynamical system featuring an eigenfrequency which fluctuates around its mean value. The dynamics is analyzed by making use of simulations and by the method of averaging. It is shown that when the eigenfrequency fluctuates, the system behaves as if it had an augmented level of dissipation and that this induces a reduction in the quality factor. It is concluded that this mechanism could have an important impact on the development of oscillations in liquid rocket engines. (C) 2009 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study evaluated the utility of the Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrievement (SAFER) model to estimate daily and seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETa) using Sentinel 2 images at 10-m spatial resolution and 5-day revisit time in 3 vineyards located at two sites in California. A unique characteristic of this model is the estimation of synthetic temperature maps, which are used as part of the estimation of ET and energy balance. The SAFER energy balance results were validated with six eddy covariance (EC) flux towers as part of the Grape Remote-sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX). The estimated surface temperature derived from upwelling longwave radiation measurements was closely correlated with the observed sensor surface temperature with R-2 higher than 0.86 for the analyzed EC towers. After performing an internal calibration, SAFER root mean square error (RMSE) values on daily ETa were between 0.64 and 0.75 mm day(-1). Additionally, the seasonal ETa was estimated and compared with the EC observations showing an average R-2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.52 mm/season.

We have estimated its mean rate of expansion from 1992 to 2000 to be approximately 33 km year(-1), using data from the annual surveys of the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation. We investigated whether or not D. virgifera can establish itself at certain places in Europe, taking its temperature-dependent development into account. We also estimated the time it will take D. virgifera to reach the Netherlands, considering only its dispersal by flight. All life stage transitions of D. virgifera were simulated with the program INSIM to assess whether or not it could establish itself in particular places. In the simulations, we used the available laboratory data on its life history characteristics, as well as a time series (2-6 years) of daily minimum and maximum temperatures from weather stations across Europe. The temperature-dependent net reproduction resulting from the simulations showed that D. virgifera populations cannot establish themselves at latitudes above 55degreesN. The overall expected velocity of D. virgifera's range expansion was computed with van den Bosch et al.'s formula [van den Bosch F, Hengeveld R & Metz JAJ (1992) Analysing the velocity of animal range expansion. Journal of Biogeography 19: 135-150], where the expansion velocity was based on dispersal characteristics and demographic parameters. We predicted that D. virgifera will not reach the Netherlands by flight from the border of its 2000 range before 2018 using this overall expected velocity. The explanation of this late arrival is that the velocity of population expansion decreases in all directions from the centre of its 2000 range due to unfavourable temperatures. Our analysis is an improvement on former analyses in that it uses temperature-dependent life history characteristics. We stress, however, that the lack of knowledge on dispersal behaviour and on the values of life history characteristics in field situations might severely limit the applicability of the predicted velocity.",,,,,,"Hemerik, Lia/0000-0002-6892-2840",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-8703,1570-7458,,,,APR,2004,111,1,,,,,59,69,,10.1111/j.0013-8703.2004.00150.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0013-8703.2004.00150.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000220425900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Synchronization of these timers to environmental light-dark cycles ('entrainment') is crucial for an organism's fitness. Little is known about which oscillator qualities determine entrainment, i.e., entrainment range, phase and amplitude. In a systematic theoretical and experimental study, we uncovered these qualities for circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN-the master clock in mammals) and the lung (a peripheral clock): (i) the ratio between stimulus (zeitgeber) strength and oscillator amplitude and (ii) the rigidity of the oscillatory system (relaxation rate upon perturbation) determine entrainment properties. Coupling among oscillators affects both qualities resulting in increased amplitude and rigidity. These principles explain our experimental findings that lung clocks entrain to extreme zeitgeber cycles, whereas SCN clocks do not. We confirmed our theoretical predictions by showing that pharmacological inhibition of coupling in the SCN leads to larger ranges of entrainment. These differences between master and the peripheral clocks suggest that coupling-induced rigidity in the SCN filters environmental noise to create a robust circadian system.

Both Hindcast simulations and observations generally show increases for the 1981-2010 historical period. The multimodel-mean Hindcast trends are statistically significant for all regions while the observed trends are statistically significant for the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest regions. An analysis of CMIP5 simulations driven by historical natural (HistoricalNat) forcings shows that the Hindcast trends are generally within the 5th-95th-percentile range of HistoricalNat trends, but those outside that range are heavily skewed toward exceedances of the 95th-percentile threshold. Future projections for 2006-35 indicate increases in all regions with respect to 1981-2010. While there is good qualitative agreement between the observations and Hindcast simulations regarding the direction of recent trends, the multimodel-mean trends are similar for all regions, while there is considerable regional variability in observed trends. Furthermore, the HistoricalNat simulations suggest that observed historical trends are a combination of natural variability and anthropogenic forcing. Thus, the influence of anthropogenic forcing on the magnitude of near-term future changes could be temporarily masked by natural variability. However, continued observed increases in extreme precipitation in the first decade (2006-15) of the future period partially confirm the Predict results, suggesting that incorporation of increases in planning would appear prudent.",,,,,"Kunkel, Kenneth/C-7280-2015","Kunkel, Kenneth/0000-0001-6667-7047",,,,,,,,,,,,,1558-8424,1558-8432,,,,APR,2019,58,4,,,,,875,886,,10.1175/JAMC-D-18-0057.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-18-0057.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000463886000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Strong soil moisture feedbacks on the daily mean and maximum temperatures identified by the CCSM-WRF model system mainly appear over the region from southern Siberia through eastern Mongolia to northeast China, the Tibetan Plateau, and most areas of central and east China, accounting for 30%-70% of the total variances. Meanwhile, the simulated soil moisture feedbacks on daily minimum temperature are shown to be much weaker than those on daily mean and maximum temperatures. The soil moisture-temperature feedbacks in the CCSM-WRF model system are generally well validated with those from two reanalysis products.

Captive birds fed ad libitum increased their body mass at higher wind speeds and lower temperatures, suggesting regulation of energy stores, whereas free-living birds exhibited patterns suggesting thermoregulatory limits on body mass regulation. Daily energy expenditure in aviary dunlin was 2.85 kJ g d(-1), or 2.8x basal metabolic rate (BMR), with thermostatic costs averaging 59 % of daily expenditure. Slight but significant increases in body mass and energy expenditure in captive birds on rainy days, adjusted for possible external water mass, suggested rainfall as a proximate cue in regulating daily body mass. Body mass changes under artificial rainfall indicated similar results, and field masses suggested that free-living birds have greater body mass on days with measurable rainfall. Increased activity costs under artificial rainfall were associated with an increase in maintenance activities, relative to controls. Whether activity costs increased on days with natural rates of rainfall was unclear.

Germination, cell division, expansive growth rate, leaf initiation, and phenology showed coordinated temperature responses and followed common laws within each species. The activities of 10 enzymes involved in carbon metabolism exhibited monotonous exponential responses across the whole range 10-40 degrees C. Hence, the temperature dependence of developmental processes is not explained by a simple relationship to central metabolism. Temperature-compensated rates of development were calculated from the equations of response curve, by expressing rates per unit equivalent time at 20 degrees C.

In this paper, the statistical framework is proposed to define the generalized granular temperature which sums up the configurational temperature and translational granular temperature. The configurational temperature, translational and rotational granular temperatures of particles are simulated by means of CFD-DEM (discrete element method) in a 3D flat-base spout bed with a jet. The configurational temperatures of particles are calculated from instantaneous overlaps of particles. The translational and rotational granular temperatures of particles are calculated from instantaneous translational and angular velocities of particles. Roughly, the simulated translational and rotational granular temperatures increase, reach maximum, and then decrease with the increase of solids volume fractions. However, the configurational temperature increases with the increase of solids volume fractions. At high solid volume fraction, the predicted configurational temperatures are larger than the translational and rotational granular temperatures, indicating that the rate of energy dissipation do contributes by contact deformation of elastic particles. The generalized granular temperature is proposed to show the relation between the variance of the fluctuation velocity of deformation and the variance of the translational fluctuation velocity of particles. The constitutive relations of particle pressure, viscosity, granular conductivity of fluctuating energy and energy dissipation in rapid-intermediate-dense granular flows are correlated to the generalized granular temperature. The variations of particle pressure, shear viscosity, energy dissipation and granular conductivity are analyzed on the basis of generalized granular temperature in a flat-base spout bed with a jet.

In rats, anticipation of a daily meal has been interpreted as a circadian rhythm controlled by a food-entrained oscillator (FEO) with circadian limits to entrainment. Lesion experiments place this FEO outside of the light-entrainable circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Mice also anticipate a fixed daily meal, but circadian limits to entrainment and anticipation of more than 2 daily meals, have not been assessed. We used a video-based behavior recognition system to quantify food anticipatory activity in mice receiving 2, 3, or 6 daily meals at intervals of 12, 8, or 4-hours (h). Individual mice were able to anticipate as many as 4 of 6 daily meals, and anticipation persisted during meal omission tests. On the 6 meal schedule, pre-prandial activity and body temperature were poorly correlated, suggesting independent regulation. Mice showed a limited ability to anticipate an 18 h feeding schedule. Finally, mice showed concurrent circadian and sub-hourly anticipation when provided with 6 small meals, at 30 minute intervals, at a fixed time of day. These results indicate that mice can anticipate feeding opportunities at a fixed time of day across a wide range of intervals not previously associated with anticipatory behavior in studies of rats.

Ecological Modelling 183, 183-210.] that was revised, extended and completely re-parameterised for barley (Hordeum vulgare L) with special regard for these factors to facilitate the use of the model in ecophysiological studies and in crop modelling. The analysis is based on novel comprehensive data on photosynthetic CO2 and light response curves measured at two oxygen concentrations and different temperatures on leaves of barley (H. vulgare L.) differing in leaf N and chlorophyll content. Plants were grown in climatic chambers or in the field at different N and T-g. We thoroughly revised the existing and introduced new nitrogen relations for key model parameters that account for a linear increase with leaf N of V-max, J(max), T-p, and R-dmax (maximum rates of carboxylation, electron transport, triose phosphate export, and mitochondrial respiration), a saturation-type increase of phi (quantum yield of electron transport), and a non-linear decrease of theta and m (curvature of the light dependence of electron transport rate, scaling factor of the stomata model). The adaptation of photosynthetic characteristics to T-g was included into the model by linear relations that were observed between T-g and the activation energy Delta H-a of the temperature response characteristics of V-max, J(max), and T-p as well as of the nitrogen dependency of these characteristics. Based on an analysis of diurnal time courses of gas exchange rates it was found necessary including not only the relation between leaf water potential (Psi) and stomatal conductance as used originally in LEAFC3, but additional effects on V-max and J(max) with the above-listed extensions, the model was capable to reproduce the observed plasticity and the recorded diurnal time courses of gas exchange rates fairly well. Thus, we conclude that the new model version can be used under a broad range of conditions, both for ecophysiological studies and as a submodel of crop growth models. The results presented here for barley will facilitate adapting photosynthesis models like LEAFC3-N to other C-3-species as well. The modelling of the effects of drought stress should be further elaborated in future based on more specific experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These larvae ultimately need to return to the nearshore environment to settle. One proposed mechanism of transport to the nearshore is the internal tide. The Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus (Cancer) magister, is one species that is hypothesized to be transported by the internal tide. In addition to daily cycles in catch of megalopae being correlated with the internal tide, the annual catch of megalopae is correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. However, intial studies occurred during a positive phase Pacific Decadal Oscillation. In this study, we analyze an additional 12 years of data (16 years total) to determine if the internal tide continues to be correlated with the transport of Dungeness crab megalopae. We used wavelet analyses and cross-Fourier analysis to relate the catch of megalopae to the daily maximum tidal range, wind speed, and sea surface temperature. We found that over 16 years, the correlation with the daily maximum tidal range continues to be the strongest correlate with the daily catch of megalopae. These results continue to suggest megalopae are transported across the continental shelf by the internal tide. Our use of wavelets allowed us to examine the annual trends in periodicity of returning megalopae. We found that the periodicities at tidal frequencies did not persist throughout the settlement season. We hypothesize this indicates cross-shelf transport is primarily regulated by the internal tide but additional, unknown factors, interact with the internal tide affecting the number of returning larvae.

However, neighbouring plants also affect each other in positive ways. Positive facilitative effects can occur when neighbouring plants ameliorate harsh abiotic conditions (temperature, wind and high irradiation). Thus, when environmental conditions are severe, the importance of facilitation may increase. The co-occurrence and masking effects of competition and facilitation among neighbouring plants have made it difficult to tease them apart in the past. We planted bur oak acorns (Quercus macrocarpa) into an experimental diversity gradient in a central MN grassland that provided a gradient in plant biomass. We predicted that greater biomass of neighbours would increase both competition and facilitation as measured by impacts on the minimum leaf water potential reached on any given day. Under moderate conditions, competition should predominate, but under hot/dry conditions, facilitation should become more important. We measured temperature, humidity and soil moisture in these plots for two growing seasons, as well as oak seedling leaf water potential across a range of daily conditions. On cool/humid days, plant interactions were dominated by competition for soil water: leaf water potentials of juvenile oaks were lower in plots with greater herbaceous biomass (and higher diversity). Conversely, on hot/dry days, facilitation of the microclimate determined the net effect of plants on their neighbours: leaf water potentials of juvenile oaks were higher in plots with higher herbaceous diversity and biomass.Synthesis. In terms of plant water status, plant interactions among neighbours can flip from net negative (competition) to net positive (facilitation) depending on daily abiotic conditions.

However, residual sensitivity to such effects can still serve as a significant source of frequency fluctuations and drift in precision devices. This is experimentally demonstrated in this paper for a precision oven-controlled and vacuum-sealed silicon resonators. The frequency fluctuations of oscillators constructed using two separate nearly-identical co-located resonators on the same chip are analysed and differential frequency fluctuations are examined as a means of reducing the impact of common-mode effects such as temperature and pressure.

Within a frequency gradient, we allowed the temperature to fluctuate from 18 +/- 3 degrees C at different rates (6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h). The temperature fluctuation frequency gradient was contrasted to a constant temperature treatment with the same mean temperature (18 degrees C). Phytoplankton biomass tended to increase with faster fluctuations but was lowest in the diurnal frequency treatment (24 h). In comparison with constant conditions, diurnal or slower fluctuation frequencies showed lower or comparable performance, whereas faster fluctuations showed higher performance. In addition, minor differences in community structure were observed, but species diversity remained comparable over time. Similarly, resource use efficiency and stoichiometry did not change according to fluctuation frequency treatments. We conclude that the effect of temperature fluctuations on phytoplankton biomass depends on the fluctuation frequency; this suggests that the fluctuation frequency determines how organisms average their environments.

The study investigated the daily and seasonal structures of LLJs as well as several possible causes. A total of 1,407 1-h LLJ periods were detected based on an adaptive definition that enabled determination of four LLJ categories. The majority (77 %) of LLJs were found to have speeds 14.0 m s (maximum of 34.6 m s and occur at an average altitude below 600 m (76 % of the observed LLJs). The dominant direction of the LLJs was from the south-south-west, which accounted for nearly 32 %, with the second most common wind direction ranging from to , albeit with a number of stronger LLJs from the west-south-west. A comparison of LLJs and South-west Jets revealed that the frequencies of occurrence in summer are totally different. Results also revealed that in spring and summer, most LLJs originate from the south-south-west, whereas in autumn and winter, north-east is the dominant direction of origin. The peak heights of LLJs tended to be higher in winter than in other seasons. The horizontal wind speed and peak height of the LLJs displayed pronounced diurnal cycles. The Hilbert-Huang transform technique was applied to demonstrate that the intrinsic mode functions with a cycle of nearly 23 h at levels below 800 m, and the instantaneous amplitudes of inertial events (0.0417-0.0476 h frequencies) have large values at 300-600 m. The variations in the occurrences of LLJs suggested connections between the formation mechanisms of LLJs and the South-west Jet stream, steady occupation of synoptic-scale pressure system, and land-sea temperature contrasts.",,,,,"wei, wei/AHA-4188-2022","Ye, Xinxin/0000-0001-8558-1294",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-8314,1573-1472,,,,DEC,2013,149,3,,,,,403,424,,10.1007/s10546-013-9852-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10546-013-9852-8,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000327208300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Focusing on the fact that the amount of compensation depends on the length of the impulse response, we reduce the computation required by segmenting the impulse response. We segment the impulse responses in the time domain and estimate the effect of temperature fluctuation for each of the segments.

Observations and modelling fields during the period 1970-2099 are used. Modelling simulations from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment-South Asia experiments (CORDEX-SA) suites are considered. In addition, four seasons-winter (Dec, Jan, Feb: DJF), pre-monsoon (Mar, Apr, May: MAM), monsoon (Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep: JJAS) and post-monsoon (Oct, Nov: ON)-are considered to detect the possible seasonal response of elevation dependency. Firstly, precipitation and temperature fields, separately, as well as the diurnal temperature range (DTR) are assessed. Following, their long-term trends are investigated, if varying, at different elevational ranges in the IHR. To explain plausible physical mechanisms due to elevation dependency, trend of other variables viz., surface downward longwave radiation (DLR), total cloud faction, soil moisture, near surface specific humidity, surface snow melt and surface albedo, etc. are investigated. Results point towards an decreased (increased) precipitation in higher (lower) elevation. And amplified warming signals at higher elevations (above 3000 m), both in daytime and nighttime temperatures, during all seasons except the monsoon, are noticed. Increased DLR trends at higher elevation are also simulated well by the model and are likely the main elevation dependent driver in the IHR.",,,,,"palazzi, elisa/C-7048-2015","palazzi, elisa/0000-0003-1683-5267; Dimri, A P/0000-0002-7832-8669",,,,,,,,,,,,,0930-7575,1432-0894,,,,JUL,2022,59,1-2,,,,,1,21,,10.1007/s00382-021-06113-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-021-06113-z,,JAN 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000748160800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experiments were conducted to quantify temperature-induced developmental responses of White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) yolk-sac larvae (YSL) reared at temperatures encountered across the species' range (12.5, 14.0, 15.5, and 17.0 degrees C). We quantified effects of temperature on timing of transitions between sequential developmental stages from hatch to initiation of exogenous feeding. Rate of development significantly increased at warmer compared to cooler temperatures; no significant difference was observed between 15.5 and 17.0 degrees C or 12.5 and 14.0 degrees C. When standardized by relative timing of development (RTi), developmental rate was not significantly different among treatments. Morphological traits (total length; body area; yolk-sac area; head area; gill filament area; mouth area; pectoral fin area) were measured daily, though only data for YSL reared at 12.5 and 17.0 degrees C was used to quantify phenotypic variation. Morphological traits (excluding yolk-sac area) were generally larger 48+ hours post hatch for YSL reared at 17. 0 degrees C compared to 12.5 degrees C. In contrast, these same traits, with the exception of gill filament area, were larger in 12.5 degrees C reared YSL when considered as a function of developmental stage. These opposing results suggest trade-offs associated with allocating resources to a particular trait depended on rearing temperature. Our results provide the ability to estimate timing of critical early life stages (i.e., hatch, emergence) as a function of temperature which is an important management tool to understand how early life development contributes to recruitment processes and adaptability in thermally altered systems.",,,,,,"Crossman, James/0000-0002-7134-982X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1909,1573-5133,,,,SEP,2020,103,9,,,,,1149,1162,,10.1007/s10641-020-01007-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-020-01007-1,,AUG 2020,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000555347500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For fermions system, the results in the limit where the reached temperature T is small and where there is no constraint for the reached temperature T compared to the Fermi energy epsilon(f) at a given density rho are given, respectively. Quadrupole and multiplicity fluctuation relations are derived in terms of T/epsilon(f). We compared the two set results in the limit when T is much smaller compared to Fermi energy epsilon(f) and they are consistent, as expected. The classical limit is also obtained for high temperatures and low densities. For bosons system, quadrupole and multiplicity fluctuations using Landau's theory of fluctuations near the critical point for a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at a given density rho are derived. As an example, we apply our approach to heavy ion collisions using the Constrained Molecular Dynamics model (CoMD) which includes the fermionic statistics. The multiplicity fluctuation quenching for fermions is found in the model and confirmed by experimental data. To reproduce the available experimental data better, we propose a modification of the collision term in the approach to include the possibility of alpha-alpha collisions. The relevant Bose-Einstein factor in the collision term is properly taken into account. This approach increases the yields of bosons relative to fermions closer to data.

Observations of spectral width distribution variations made by the radars allow an independent determination of the systematic error in the height. We have investigated the dependence of this distribution on a number of factors including the radar geometry, diurnal and seasonal cycles, variations in solar UV irradiance and geomagnetic activity. Changes in the altitude of the mean meteor layer observed at different radar ranges provide us with some insight into the structure of the upper mesosphere and the lower thermosphere within which the meteors are being ablated. An examination of the spectral widths, as measured by the CUTLASS Finland radar, in the days preceding and following a Storm Sudden Commencement in April 1997, illustrates how the spectral properties of the observed region can be affected.

Methods and Results: The growth of A. flavus on paddy and aflatoxin production were studied following a full factorial design with seven a(w) levels within the range of 0.82-0.99 and seven temperatures between 10 and 43 degrees C. The growth of the fungi, expressed as colony diameter (mm), was measured daily, and the aflatoxins were analysed using HPLC with a fluorescence detector. The maximum colony growth rates of both isolates were estimated by fitting the primary model of Baranyi to growth data. Three potentially suitable secondary models, Rosso, polynomial and Davey, were assessed for their ability to describe the radial growth rate as a function of temperature and a(w). Both strains failed to grow at the marginal temperatures (10 and 43 degrees C), regardless of the a(w) studied, and at the a(w) level of 0.82, regardless of temperature. Despite that the predictions of all studied models showed good agreement with the observed growth rates, Davey model proved to be the best predictor of the experimental data.

Species with little sensitivity to temperature fluctuation in light showed a clear sensitivity in darkness. The germination percentage was 4.0% for species with seed weights >0.9 mg and 23% for species with seed weights <0.9 mg. By means of a principal component analysis the investigated species could be divided into three groups: (1) species with considerable germination at constant temperature, (2) species with a high germination percentage in response to strong fluctuations but no germination at the constant temperature and at low amplitudes and (3) species which did not germinate at all or showed a low degree of germination at high amplitudes in light. The germination percentage of recently matured seeds was generally lower at 22/10 degrees C (15 degrees C mean) than at 28/16 degrees C (22 degrees C mean). Cold-wet stratification enhanced germination at 22/10 degrees C in 33 species in light, and in 26 species strict dark dormancy was relieved. Sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, a need for relatively high temperature fluctuations to trigger germination and reach 50% of maximum germination and prolonged lag-phases of non-stratified seeds were common features of almost all investigated sedges and might favour the built-up of persistent seed banks. The capacity to respond to fluctuating temperatures in particular provides a mechanism favouring spring germination. Sedges occurring in dry or mesic habitats showed a lower sensitivity to alternating temperatures than sedges of wet habitats. In contrast to forest species of other taxa, forest sedges were highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations, thereby restricting their germination to vegetation gaps. The variation in response to fluctuating temperatures and stratification in general were relatively small in the investigated Carer species, thus suggesting that their germination behaviour was determined not only by habitat conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0367-2530,1618-0585,,,,JAN,1999,194,1,,,,,21,32,,10.1016/S0367-2530(17)30876-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0367-2530(17)30876-9,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000078418100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The proposed device converts the daily ambient temperature variations into a temperature difference on the TEG using a PCM, thus temperature variations can produce electrical energy. Thermal modeling is developed and compared with the experimental result. The developed system is evaluated by using a temperature-controlled oven as well as an actual ambient environment. The maximum output power can reach 0.6 mW which corresponds to a power density of 37.5 mu W/cm(2) under the ambient temperature variants from 5 degrees C to 35 degrees C (using the temperature-controlled oven) while it is approximately 11.9 mu W/cm(2) in the real ambient environment (outdoor evaluation with ambient temperature variation in range of 12 degrees C to 24 degrees C). The effects on the output power of the TEG in both cases with and without PCM have been evaluated and the effect of the PCM is confirmed. Also, we are not only concentrating on the phase change states of PCM to generate the electrical energy but also focusing on the non-phase change state which could open the possibility for low-power applications. The proposed system could be considered as an electrical power source for miniature systems such as wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensing systems. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The thermal time constant has been measured and studied using a one-dimensional finite element method. This sensor was applied in a test facility where two water streams of different temperatures and the same flow speed blend downstream of the rear edge of a splitter plate in a horizontal rectangular channel.

Feed was fed to excess daily and uneaten food was collected. Temperature significantly affected the specific growth rate of both year classes of abalone. There was no significant effect of dietary protein level on specific growth rate; however, abalone compensated for a reduction of dietary protein by consuming more feed. This observation was evident with significant increases in feed conversion ratios as dietary protein levels decreased for both year classes. With the exception of abalone grown at 14 degrees C, when protein deposition decreased with increasing dietary protein level, protein deposition increased with an increase in dietary protein for both year classes. For 1-y-old abalone, as temperature increased from 14-22 degrees C, the optimum crude dietary protein levels increased from similar to 29% similar to 35%.

We tested the RFT-based model for survival across multiple areas of the insect's range in the Italian Alps over a 2-year period. In a series of translocation experiments using natural temperature gradients as spatial analogues for global warming, we transferred colonies of T pityocampa larvae to sites within zones of historical distribution, recent distribution, and outside the present range. The sites included traditional (Pinus nigra, Pinus sylvestris) as well as novel (Pinus mugo, Pinus uncinata, Pinus cembra) hosts. Survival during precold (August to November), cold (December to February) and postcold (March to May) periods were analysed against climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and predictors developed by the model. Host species did not significantly affect final survival, with the exception of slower larval development, and resulting lower cold tolerance, on P cembra than on R mugo at the same site. Across all the sites and hosts, final survival of colonies depended on the number of feeding hours during the cold period (RFT), which explained 82% of the variance in a regression model.

Ambient temperatures immediately outside the logs were recorded simultaneously with thermohygrometers. Temperatures were recorded every hour for 24 h on four non-consecutive days. Differences between ambient temperatures and temperatures within nests were noted during the day and night. In all cases temperatures in brood and storage pots area were different from the ambient temperature (P < 0.01). There was no significant relationship between intranidal and ambient temperatures during the day (09.00 h to 20.00 h) on all days of measurement (P > 0.01). However, during lower ambient temperatures at night (21.00 h to 08.00 h) intranidal and ambient temperatures were significantly correlated (P < 0.01).

Assuming that the net radiation and turbulent heat fluxes have phases identical to that of the soil surface temperature, we evaluate potential contributions of the wave phase difference to the surface energy balance closure. Results show that the sum of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux is always less than the available surface energy (i.e., the difference between net radiation and soil surface heat flux) even if all energy components are accurately measured, their footprints are strictly matched, and all corrections related to measurement environments and techniques are made. The energy balance closure ratio is extremely sensitive to the ratio of soil surface heat flux amplitude (A(4)) to net radiation flux amplitude (A(1)), and a high value of A(4)/A(1) causes a significant failure in surface energy balance closure.

The temperature combinations gave differences (DIF) between DT and NT ranging from -12 to +12-degrees-C. After propagation the plants were transferred to a greenhouse and grown at a constant DT and NT set point of 21-degrees-C for 8 weeks after propagation. The experiment was carried out in early spring under natural light conditions. The rate of development was dependent on the temperature regime. DT lower than NT inhibited growth and development of the young plants, except for leaf unfolding rate which depended on the average daily temperature (ADT) only. Both an increase in ADT and DIF enhanced internode length. However, increasing the ADT by only raising DT affected the elongation to a larger extent than an equal raise of DT and NT. For flower bud development an increase in negative values of DIF reduced the number of flower buds to a greater extent than an increase in positive values.

This study explored the effects of boundary conditions (air versus ground surface temperature and humidity), ground temperature cycles, and their diminishing amplitude with depth and advective flows (Darcy flow and wind pumping) on water vapor fluxes in soils and ice table depths using the REGO vapor diffusion model. We conducted a series of numerical experiments that illustrated different hypothetical scenarios and estimated the water vapor flux and ice table depth using the conditions in University Valley, a small high elevation valley. In situ measurements showed that while the mean annual ground surface temperature approximates that in the air, the mean annual ground surface relative humidity (>85%(ice)) was significantly higher than in the atmosphere (similar to 50%(ice)). When ground surface temperature and humidity were used as boundary conditions, along with damping diurnal and annual temperature cycles within the sandy soil, REGO predicted that measured ice table depths in the valley were in equilibrium with contemporary conditions. Based on model results, a dry soil column can become saturated with ice within centuries.

However, previous electrically heated electrodes, including microwires and microdiscs, are usually small and often suffer from the requirement of frequent calibrations of the electrode surface temperature (T-s) at different environment temperatures. Here, we fabricate a temperature-controllable disk electrode (TCDE) with a conventional size (3-5 mm in diameter). A one-parameter temperature calibration is proposed using a temperature transfer coefficient alpha and a structural model (T-s = T-e + alpha (T-h - T-e)) to estimate T-s (T-h and T-e are the temperature of the heating element and environment, respectively). The value of alpha is unique for a TCDE and mainly dependent on the structure and materials of the electrodes and the solution in nature. Once alpha is experimentally determined, T-s can be calibrated and found to be applicable to wide fluctuations in room temperature (15.0-33.0 degrees C) with errors below 1.5% for three types of disk electrodes (gold, glassy carbon, and platinum). The required T-s can be obtained by just setting T-h without thermal characterization between the heating power and T-s. A simple relationship for exploring the dependence of alpha on the height (H) and radius (R) of the electrode materials and other constants (a, b, c, and R-0), alpha = 1 - c - aH - b (R - R-0)(2), is revealed by numerical simulations (COMSOL). The impact of the radii of both the insulating materials of the electrode and the electrochemical cells on T-s is also considered. The effect of the solution thermal conductivity on alpha is studied.

Torpor should be avoided during reproduction because of potential incompatibility with offspring growth. To test if torpor can be used during gestation and lactation to compensate for food shortage, we exposed reproductive female grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus), a heterothermic primate, to different levels of food availability. Torpor use was characterised by daily skin temperature profiles, and its energetic outcome was assessed from changes in body mass. Food shortage triggered torpor during the end of the gestation period (n = 1), ranging from shallow in response to 40% food restriction to deep daily torpor in response to 80% restriction. During the early period of lactation, females fed ad libitum(n = 2) or exposed to a 40% restriction (n = 4) remained normothermic; but 80% food restricted females (n = 5) gave priority to energy saving, increasing the frequency and depth of torpor bouts. The use of torpor was insufficient to compensate for 80% energetic shortage during lactation resulting in loss of mass from the mother and delayed growth in the pups. This study provides the first evidence that a heterothermic primate can use torpor to compensate for food shortages even during reproduction.

The theory contains the expected Arrhenius and VTF dependence as the asymptotic limits at low and high temperatures, respectively. In addition, a critical transition temperature at which the electrical conductivity behavior changes from Arrhenius-like to VTF-like is determined analytically.

Groups of 60 early juveniles (0.6-3.7 g) were reared in each of 18 aquaria in which six experimental groups were run in triplicate. Daily food ratios were adjusted according to fish biomass, differences in hydration between the two diets and rearing temperature. No mortality occurred during the experiment. Condition coefficient K was significantly higher in fish fed Aller Futura compared to those fed Chironomidae irrespective of temperature tested; body deformities were not recorded. Relative growth rate at the same temperature was always higher in fish on the formulated diet than in those fed Chironomidae, and food conversion ratio was always suppressed, both suggesting an efficient utilization of Aller Futura for growth in B. barbus early juveniles. On both diets the coefficient K was depressed at 21 degrees C.

Area averages can only be determined with reasonable accuracy from a sufficiently large number of stations within a grid-box. However, the station network on which E-OBS is based comprises only 2,316 stations, spread unevenly across approximately 18,000 0.22A degrees grid-boxes. Consequently, grid-box data in E-OBS are derived through interpolation of stations up to 500 km distant, with the distance of stations that contribute significantly to any grid-box value increasing in areas with lower station density. Since more dispersed stations have less shared variance, the resultant interpolated values are likely to be over-smoothed, and extreme daily values even more so. We perform an experiment over five E-OBS grid boxes for precipitation and temperature that have a sufficiently dense local station network to enable a reasonable estimate of the area-average. We then create a series of randomly selected station sub-networks ranging in size from four to all stations within the E-OBS interpolation search radii. For each sub-network realisation, we estimate the grid-box average applying the same interpolation methodology as used for E-OBS, and then evaluate the effect of network density on the distribution of daily values, as well as trends in extremes indices. The results show that when fewer stations have been used for the interpolation, both precipitation and temperature are over-smoothed, leading to a strong tendency for interpolated daily values to be reduced relative to the true area-average. The smoothing is greatest for higher percentiles, and therefore has a disproportionate effect on extremes and any derived extremes indices. For many regions of the E-OBS dataset, the station density is sufficiently low to expect this smoothing effect to be significant and this should be borne in mind by any users of the E-OBS dataset.",,,,,"Hofstra, Nynke/C-7879-2014; New, Mark/A-7684-2008","Hofstra, Nynke/0000-0002-0409-5145; New, Mark/0000-0001-6082-8879",,,,,,,,,,,,,0930-7575,1432-0894,,,,OCT,2010,35,5,,,,,841,858,,10.1007/s00382-009-0698-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-009-0698-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000282210800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We conducted experiments to estimate gastric evacuation (GEVAC) and collected field data from Lake Michigan to estimate index of fullness [(g prey/g fish weight)100%) to determine daily ration for water temperatures ranging 2-5 degrees C, coinciding with the winter and early spring season. Exponential GEVAC rates equaled 0.0115/h for slimy sculpin and 0.0147/h for deepwater sculpin, and did not vary between 2.7 degrees C and 5.1 degrees C for either species or between prey types (Mysis relicta and fish eggs) for slimy sculpin. Index of fullness varied with fish size, and averaged 1.93% and 1.85% for slimy and deepwater sculpins, respectively. Maximum index of fullness was generally higher (except for the smallest sizes) for both species in 2009-2010 than in 1976 despite reductions in a primary prey, Diporeia spp. Predictive daily ration equations were derived as a function of fish dry weight. Estimates of daily consumption ranged from 0.2 to 0.8% of their body weight, which was within the low range of estimates from other species at comparably low water temperatures.

Our experiments demonstrated that fluctuating temperatures (20-30 degrees C) significantly accelerated development but inhibited adult reproduction and reduced triglyceride reserves in both migrant and resident populations compared with a constant temperature of 25 degrees C, because the larval period, pupal period, lifetime fecundity, mating frequency, ovarian development and triglyceride content significantly decreased, while the preoviposition period obviously increased. A relative decreased tendency of flight capacity was observed for migrants and residents under fluctuating temperatures. We also confirmed that populations and sexes differed in their responses to temperature variations. Mythimna separata residents showed slower development, weaker flight capacity and lower triglyceride content but greater reproductive performance than the migrants under both fluctuating and constant temperatures.

Since many types of building materials are complexly applied in residential buildings in UAE and are constantly using air-conditioning, the result might be different from the characteristics of indoor air pollutants from a small chamber experiment. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between the concentration of indoor air pollutants according to changes in temperature and humidity in newly built apartments before moving in. As a methodology, a field measurement was performed in 23 housing units in five different residential towers in Ajman, United Arab Emirates. Before the measurement, a 7-day bake-out was completed, and the target units were measured 30 days before moving in. The result showed that formaldehyde (HCHO) and VOCs such as benzene (C6H6), toluene (C7H8), ethylbenzene (C8H10), xylene (C8H10), and styrene (C8H8) have consistent humidity dependence within the range of 15 %-60% of relative humidity (RH). It was impossible to confirm the temperature dependency since it showed different characteristics for each apartment between 22 degrees C and 33 degrees C. There is a limit to predicting the occurrence of indoor air pollutants in the apartment only with microclimatic factors since there are many other variables, such as various building materials, management history of materials, and construction methods. However, it was proven that there is an emission cut-off point where the generation of indoor air pollutants deviates from a linear relationship in the RH 40%-50% and 25 degrees C. These temperature and humidity ranges are synchronized with daily life ranges.",,,,,,"Jung, Chuloh/0000-0002-0898-8450",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2297-3362,,,,SEP 16,2022,8,,,,,,,,1032665,10.3389/fbuil.2022.1018395,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbuil.2022.1018395,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000862707000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The energetic response of juvenile gray snapper to temperature and salinity was measured in laboratory experiments to determine the influence of these physicochemical factors on the potential value of different juvenile nurseries. Maximum consumption and growth rates of juvenile (25-50 mm SL) gray snapper were determined in 12-day trials at 20 temperature/salinity combinations representing conditions in juvenile habitats. Ad libitum feeding level of individual fish was measured daily. Maximum weight specific feeding rate increased significantly with temperature and salinity; however, the effect of salinity was much less than that of temperature. Linear growth rate and specific growth rate both increased with temperature, and salinity did not have a significant effect on either. Gross growth efficiency (K-1, growthxconsumption(-1)*100) increased with temperature and was significantly lower at high salinities, indicating increased energetic costs. The higher K-1 at lower salinities has several implications for juvenile gray snapper in low salinity habitats: (1) they would need less food to achieve the same somatic growth as juveniles in high salinity habitats; (2) they would have higher growth at limited ration levels as compared to high salinity habitats; and (3) they would have less impact on prey populations than higher salinity habitats assuming similar gray snapper densities.

One precision technology used is a bolus that is inserted into a cows' reticulorumen to monitor reticulorumen temperature. Although it is known that both water temperature and water quantity ingested are associated with changes in reticulorumen temperature, limited quantifiable research exists on the impact and magnitude of controlled water intake on reticulorumen temperature. We conducted an observational study to determine the effect of natural water ingestion on reticulorumen temperature, and performed a modified Latin square where cows were drenched with specific water quantities at specific temperatures to determine the effect of controlled water intake on reticuloruminal temperature. Our results demonstrated that water quantity and water temperature affect not only the magnitude of change in degrees in Celsius, but also how much time is required for reticulorumen temperature to return to baseline. This study provides insights in how to adjust the temperatures measures affected by water intake when using cattle reticulorumen temperature monitoring systems and how to estimate water consumption using decreases in reticulorumen temperature. Abstract Dairy precision technologies helps producers monitor individual animals. Reticulorumen temperature boluses are a way to monitor core body temperature; however, factors such as water intake affects reticulorumen temperature. This research determined the effect of natural water intake and a controlled water drench on reticulorumen temperature (RT) in dairy cattle. In observational study part 1, tie- stall cows (n = 4) with RT transponders were observed for natural water intake (recorded by in line water meters) for 48 h. In experiment part 2, a randomized Latin square design with cows (n = 12) restricted on feed for 4 h, were drenched daily with a water quantity of 6.7 L, 11.4 L or 22.7 L, and at controlled water temperature of 1.7 degrees C, 7.2 degrees C, 15.5 degrees C, or 29.4 degrees C. Descriptively, observational study 1 had (Mean +/- SD 0.27 +/- 0.31 L ingested per drinking event (n = 84) and RT decline from baseline was 2.29 +/- 1.82 degrees C. For the experiment, a 48-h specific rolling baseline temperature range (BTR) was calculated for each cow prior to the experiment to determine time required for RT to reach BTR, and time to return to BTR. In part 2 of the experiment, as water quantity increased, RT had a greater maximum degree drop from baseline. Water temperature and water quantity interaction influenced time required for BTR to reestablish. The coldest water temperature at the highest drench quantity affected time for BTR to reestablish the longest (103 min). Results from this study suggest that an algorithm could be designed to predict water intake events for producers using reticulorumen temperature.",,,,,"Costa, Joao H.

We investigated the temperature response of the marine sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfobacterium autotrophicum strain HRM2. Growth experiments in a temperature gradient block demonstrated that D. autotrophicum is psychrotolerant and grows between 0 and 31degreesC. The normal range of temperature for growth is between 4 and 29degreesC. The physiological response to temperature changes was studied with three sets of cells that were acclimated at 4, 10, and 28degreesC, respectively. Sulfate reduction rates were determined in the temperature gradient block with short-term incubations to minimize growth. The rates were similar at the 4 and 10degreesC acclimation temperature, and exhibited an enhanced response at 28degreesC. At every acclimation temperature, sulfate reduction rates increased 20-fold from -1.7 to 41degreesC. The relative proportion of cellular unsaturated fatty acids (e.g. cis16:1) and short-chain fatty acids increased when cells were grown at 4degreesC compared to 28degreesC. The proteome of D. autotrophicum strain HRM2 was studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with soluble extracts of cells grown at the three respective acclimation temperatures. Protein patterns were similar with the exception of two proteins showing 5-10-fold lower abundance in the 4degreesC culture compared to the 28degreesC culture. In general, D. autotrophicum strain HRM2 responded to low temperatures by reduced metabolic activity rather than by pronounced de novo synthesis of specifically adapted enzymes. Such a strategy agrees well with in situ activities measured in field studies and may reflect a common physiological principle of psychrotolerant marine sulfate-reducing bacteria.

In addition to the heat flux variations during the transients in an engine cycle, high-frequency unsteadiness occurs at every rotor passage with varying amplitudes originating from complex blade row interactions. The heat transfer is therefore time-dependent due to fluctuations in both the convective heat transfer coefficient and in the flow recovery temperature caused by the unsteady work processes within the rotor. It is apparent that the measurement of heat flux alone is not sufficient to elucidate the physical origin of the heat transfer variations, which in turn are the boundary conditions to design the cooling schemes. Hence, the accurate measurement of the adiabatic wall temperature and the adiabatic local convective coefficient becomes essential to ensure a correct thermal assessment of any turbine hardware. This paper illustrates different approaches to estimate the relevant flow parameters that drive the heat transfer based on transient turbine experiments. The work presents a detailed uncertainty analysis associated with the determination of the adiabatic wall temperature and the adiabatic convective heat transfer coefficient based on a multi-test strategy and the use of surface temperature measurements. The present study allows experimental and numerical specialists quantifying the error in the measured or calculated local gas temperature and convective heat transfer coefficient. Conducting such analysis prior to any experimental or numerical campaign will serve to minimize the test uncertainty in adiabatic wall temperature as a function of: turbine operating conditions; wall to gas temperature ratios; heat transfer uncertainty levels; number of experiments.

This paper describes the development, application, and assessment of methods to construct daily highresolution (similar to 50-m cell size) meteorological grids for the 2003 calendar year in the Upper South Santiam Watershed (USSW), a 500-km(2) mountainous catchment draining the western slope of the Oregon Cascade Mountains. Elevations within the USSW ranged from 194 to 1650 m. Meteorological elements modeled were minimum and maximum temperature; total precipitation, rainfall, and snowfall; and solar radiation and radiation-adjusted maximum temperature. The Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) was used to interpolate minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation. The separation of precipitation into rainfall and snowfall components used a temperature-based regression function. Solar radiation was simulated with the Image-Processing Workbench. Radiation-based adjustments to maximum temperature employed equations developed from data in the nearby H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest. The restrictive terrain of the USSW promoted cold-air drainage and temperature inversions by reducing large-scale airflow. Inversions were prominent nearly all year for minimum temperature and were noticeable even for maximum temperature during the autumn and winter. Precipitation generally increased with elevation over the USSW. In 2003, precipitation was nearly always in the form of rain at the lowest elevations but was about 50% snow at the highest elevations. Solar radiation followed a complex pattern related to terrain slope, aspect, and position relative to other terrain features. Clear, sunny days with a large proportion of direct radiation exhibited the greatest contrast in radiation totals, whereas cloudy days with primarily diffuse radiation showed little contrast. Radiation-adjusted maximum temperatures showed similar patterns. The lack of a high-quality observed dataset was a major issue in the interpolation of precipitation and solar radiation. However, observed data available for the USSW were superior to those available for most mountainous regions in the western United States.

M.",,,Temperature fields induced by geothermal devices,ENERGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Efficient and sustainable exploitation of low-enthalpy geothermal energy relies on accurate representations of heat transfer processes in the subsurface. An analytical model, which provides such a representation by predicting the dynamics of thermal fields induced by shallow GHEs (ground heat exchangers), is derived. The model accounts for atmospheric temperature fluctuations at the ground surface, an arbitrary geometry of GHEs operating in time-varying heating/cooling modes, and anisotropy and uncertain spatio-temporal variability of thermal conductivity of the ambient soil. To validate the model, its predictions of a thermal field generated by a shallow flat-panel GHEs are compared with experimental data. This comparison demonstrates the model's ability to provide accurate fit-free predictions of soil-temperature fields generated by GHEs. The analysis presented shows that a single horizontal GHE may affect soil temperature by several degrees at distances on the order of 1 m. The volume of influence is expressed in terms of soil thermal properties. Such modeling predictions are invaluable for screening of potential sites and optimal design of geothermal systems consisting of multiple GHEs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study evaluated uncertainties of LSTs retrieved by three operational algorithms from Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data. We compared two nonlinear split-window algorithms (SOB and WAN algorithms) and one nonlinear three-band algorithm (YAM algorithm). First, the error characteristics of the retrieved LSTs caused by the input parameter errors were simulated under various land-atmospheric conditions using an atmospheric radiative transfer model. Thereafter, retrieved LSTs from actual AHI data were evaluated using in-situ observations from AsiaFlux and OzFlux networks and the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LSTs. The simulated results showed that the YAM algorithm maintained the highest accuracy, whereas the WAN algorithm had the highest robustness to input errors. The YAM algorithm had the smallest total error including input errors over a wide range of retrieval conditions. Validation of the three algorithms via in-situ LSTs from 12 sites revealed nighttime mean RMSEs for all sites of similar to 1.7 degrees C, and daytime mean RMSEs for semi-arid and humid sites of approximately 3.0 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C, respectively. These are comparable to the accuracies reported for LST products with higher spatial resolutions, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat. Within the Himawari-8 disk, the estimation error of the YAM algorithm was similar to 1.0 degrees C lower than those of the SOB and WAN algorithms in regions with extremely high viewing angle, temperature, and humidity (e.g., northern China, Australia, and Southeast Asia). Furthermore, AHI LSTs showed closer agreement with ECOSTRESS compared to in-situ LSTs, suggesting the usefulness of ECOSTRESS for assessing the diurnal LSTs derived from geostationary satellites.

Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the subsequent thermal stress on the piston during design process to reach the optimum one. This paper tries to present a new calculation method for the theoretical design of the piston. In this study, the 3D solid model of piston in 16V280 diesel engine was developed and the simulation calculation of the steady-state and the transient-state temperature field is carried out. Based on calculation results, the maximum temperature fluctuation of the piston temperature field is less than 20 degrees, so the steady-state temperature field was used as boundary condition for the thermal stress calculation and the thermal mechanical decoupling method was used to calculate the thermal stress caused only by the uneven temperature distribution. The results show that the maximum temperature is 354 degrees C, which appears at the edge of the combustion chamber. The steady-state temperature field of finite element simulation shows a good agreement with the experimental results. The thermal stress obtained from thermal mechanical decoupling method was within the allowable range, since the maximum value is 270 MPa.

A transient creep, decaying in time by a logarithmic law, is registered both above and below 1 K. The temperature dependence of the coefficient of logarithmic creep is studied in detail, and the existence of two qualitatively different regions of its behavior is established: in the interval 4.2-1.2 K the coefficient increases linearly with decreasing temperature, while below 1 K the creep acquires an athermal character and the coefficient remains constant. It is shown that the regularities observed in the experiment are in accord with the idea that the kinetics of creep in pure beta-Sn is governed by the motion of dislocations in the Peierls potential relief by a mechanism of nucleation of kink pairs on the dislocation lines. This process entails the overcoming of a small effective potential barrier of the order of 0.001 eV: in the temperature region T<1 K the nucleation of kink pairs occurs by a quantum tunneling effect, and the creep is of a purely quantum character; at higher temperatures the leading role is played by thermal fluctuations, and the deformation kinetics corresponds to the classical ideas of thermally activated creep.

The major aim of this study is to assess the probable future changes in the minimum and maximum climatology and its long-term trend under different RCPs along with the elevation dependent warming over the IHR. A number of statistical analysis such as changes in mean climatology, long-term spatial trend and probability distribution function are carried out to detect the signals of changes in climate. The study also tries to quantify the uncertainties associated with different model experiments and their ensemble in space, time and for different seasons. The model experiments and their ensemble show prominent cold bias over Himalayas for present climate. However, statistically significant higher warming rate (0.23-0.52 degrees C/decade) for both minimum and maximum air temperature (T-min and T-max) is observed for all the seasons under both RCPs. The rate of warming intensifies with the increase in the radiative forcing under a range of greenhouse gas scenarios starting from RCP4.5 to RCP8.5. In addition to this, a wide range of spatial variability and disagreements in the magnitude of trend between different models describes the uncertainty associated with the model projections and scenarios. The projected rate of increase of Tmin may destabilize the snow formation at the higher altitudes in the northern and western parts of Himalayan region, while rising trend of T-max over southern flank may effectively melt more snow cover. Such combined effect of rising trend of Tmin and Tmax may pose a potential threat to the glacial deposits. The overall trend of Diurnal temperature range (DTR) portrays increasing trend across entire area with highest magnitude under RCP8.5.

Additionally, maximum temperature variance decreased (-17.4%; p = 0.109), minimum temperature variance decreased significantly (-22.6%; p = 0.042), and precipitation variance increased significantly (26.6%; p = 0.004). Results indicate a reduced diurnal temperature range and significant reductions in estimated VPD (10.3%; p < 0.001) that imply increased relative humidity, cloud cover, and soil moisture that may support increasingly abundant mesophytic cool genera species. Feedback mechanisms associated with extensive changes in land use, fire suppression, and browser population may have exacerbated climatic changes. Long-term assessments of changing climatic averages and variance are needed to ensure sustainability of forest ecosystem services, health, and productivity in a swiftly changing climate across the broader EDF region and similar temperate forest ecosystems globally.",,,,,,"Kutta, Evan/0000-0002-5838-9464",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1999-4907,,,,OCT,2018,9,10,,,,,,,605,10.3390/f9100605,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f9100605,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000448550700024,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigated metabolic rates and preferred body temperatures of seven taxa of Australian pythons. We found that Australian pythons have particularly low metabolic rates when compared with other bold snakes, and that the metabolic rates of the pythons did not change either seasonally or on a daily cycle. Preferred body temperatures do vary seasonally in some species but not in others. Across all species and seasons, the preferred body temperature range was only 4.9 degrees C. The thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of oxygen consumption by pythons conformed to the established range of between 2 and 3. Allometric equations for the pooled python data at each of the experimental temperatures gave an equation exponent of 0.72-0.76, which is similar to previously reported values. By having low preferred body temperatures and low metabolic rates, pythons appear to be able to conserve energy while still maintaining a vigilant 'sit and wait' predatory existence.

A Josephson junction as on-chip temperature sensor operated in ac provides the highest sensitivity and minimal power loading to the cryogenic environment, thanks to the noise rejection of lock-in detection. To demonstrate the advantages of on-chip sensing, we tested it with a Josephson voltage standard array in cryocooler and compared with the conventional case of a sensor on the cold surface of the refrigerator, showing that the power dissipated within the chip may further increment the device temperature up to some tenths of kelvin. An ac Josephson junction sensor is proven to be capable of directly stabilizing the temperature of the superconductive circuit from fluctuations of dissipated power during operation. Reliability issues related to flux trapping are discussed and solutions are proposed suited to different applications.

This method is applied to downscale T-a. of the China regional surface meteorological feature dataset (CRSMFD) at 0.1 and the ERA-interim (ERAI) product at 0.125 degrees to 0.01 degrees. The daily mean T-a and the 3-hourly instantaneous T-a. with a 0.01 are obtained. The downscaled T-a. are evaluated from the perspectives of accuracy and image quality, Results show that the daily mean T-a downscaled from the CRSMFD product has a RMSE of 1.13 +/- 1.0 K at 105 meteorological stations and RMSEs of 0.96 K to 2.34 K at three experimental stations; the instantaneous T-a. downscaled from CRSMFD has RMSEs of 1.02 K to 4.0 K at the three experimental stations. T-a. after downscaling has better agreement with the ground measured Ta than before downscaling, especially in mountain areas. By contrast, T-a. downscaled from the ERAI product has unacceptable accuracy due to the great uncertainty of the ERAI T-a. over the Tibetan Plateau.

A critical input parameter for such models is an estimate of the consumption rates and biomasses of prey consumed by fish populations. Here we estimate the annual prey consumption of an abundant coastal piscivore, Arripis trutta, which may exert substantial top-down control on its prey over its broad latitudinal range (28-43 degrees S) in the coastal waters off south-eastern (SE) Australia. Three independent techniques were used to estimate annual prey consumption at two environmentally-relevant temperatures, 15 and 20 degrees C: experimental gastric evacuation experiments (coupled with stomach content analyses); bioenergetics modelling, and; empirical regression modelling. Each technique yielded a similar range of estimates with annual food consumed/biomass (Q/B) ranging from 3.20 to 4.02 at 15 degrees C and 4.23 to 5.25 at 20 degrees C. Using an estimated A. trutta stock biomass in SE Australia of 10,000 t, total mean annual prey consumption was estimated to be 42,200 t, consisting primarily (93%) of small zooplanktivorous teleosts, particularly Australian sardines Sardinops sagax (35%) and scads Trachurus spp. (30%). These results indicate that A. trutta do possess a top-down influence on the pelagic ecosystem of coastal SE Australia via consumption of considerable biomasses of small pelagic fish. However, despite the use of a maximum regional estimate of A. trutta abundance and the presence of at least two other ecologically similar predatory fish species with higher annual prey consumption rates in SE Australian coastal waters, A. trutta may remove only a small proportion (similar to 15%) of the estimated spawning biomasses of its major prey species in this region annually. The multiple-technique approach used in this study has for the first time quantified the diet of A. trutta in SE Australia and provided broad and repeatable estimates of its annual prey consumption for use in ecosystem models designed to manage coastal fisheries resources in this region.

We radio-tagged and monitored 125 individuals of three duck species (mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Eurasian teal A. crecca crecca and northern pintail A. acuta) in three French wetlands over four winters. Home-range sizes for a given species varied greatly among our study sites. Moreover, species differed according to home-range structure and distance traveled to reach their foraging grounds (teal had a more patchy home range and traveled farther distances than mallards). Foraging distances increased with temperature and time (over the winter season), but this effect differed among species, suggesting that they behave differently in response to food depletion and/or cold weather. The commuting behavior (i.e., the decision to leave the roost at night for foraging) differed among species and season. Teals were more risk-prone because they were more likely to leave the roost at night.

This is an important consideration when choosing a site or climate data for phenological models. To our knowledge edge, there is no literature showing the effect of the underlying surface and its fetch around a weather station on degree-day accumulations. In this paper, we present data to show that this is a serious consideration. and it can lead to dubious models. Microscale measurements of temperature and energy balance are presented to explain why the differences occur. For example, the effect of fetch of irrigated grass and wetting of bare soil around a weather station on diurnal temperature are reported. A 43-day experiment showed that temperature measured on the upwind edge of an irrigated grass area averaged 4% higher than temperatures recorded 200 in inside the grass field. When the single-triangle method was used with a 10 degreesC threshold and starting on May 19. the station on the upwind edge recorded 900 degree-days on June 28. whereas the interior station recorded 900 degree-days on July 1. Clearly, a difference in fetch can lead to big errors for large degree-day accumulations. Immediately after wetting, the temperature over a wet soil surface was similar to that measured over grass. However. the temperature over the soil increased more than that over the grass as the soil surface dried. There-fore. the observed difference between temperatures measured over bare soil and those over grass increases with longer periods between wettings. In most and locations, measuring temperature over irrigated grass gives a lower mean annual temperature, resulting in lower annual cumulative degree-day values. This was verified by comparing measurements over grass with those over bare soil at several weather stations in a range of climates, To eliminate the effect of rainfall frequency, using temperature data collected only over irrigated grass, is recommended for long-term assessment of climate change effects on degree-day accumulation. In high evaporative conditions, a fetch of at least 100 m of grass is recommended. Our results clearly indicate that weather stations sited over bare soil have consistently higher degree-day accumulations. Therefore, especially in and environments, phenology models based on temperature collected over bare soil are not transferable to those based on temperature recorded over irrigated grass. At a minimum. all degree-day-based phenology models reported in the literature should clearly describe the weather station site.",,,,,"Cesaraccio, Carla/C-1515-2015; Duce, Pierpaolo/B-7634-2015","Cesaraccio, Carla/0000-0002-1642-4663; Duce, Pierpaolo/0000-0002-5011-2903; Spano, Donatella/0000-0002-5661-0241",,,,,,,,,,,,,0020-7128,,,,,NOV,2001,45,4,,,,,178,183,,10.1007/s004840100103,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004840100103,,,,,,,,11769317,,,,,WOS:000172568400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study reveals that the maximum average temperature was reduced for 3 degrees C with the use of PCM layer. The studies have been extended for an elevated temperature by incorporating a heat source where the building wall is set without PCM, with PCM slab and also encapsulated PCM. The results reveal that both the PCM slab and encapsulated PCM building wall can control the temperature as close to ambient temperature at the opposite side of the heat source. Moreover, it is found that encapsulated building walls give better performance as the overall wall thickness is kept as original wall thickness.

We provide an overview of the relative importance and spatial distribution of these components globally. A correlation analysis with precipitation and temperature reveals that both the inter-annual and subseasonal anomalies are tightly related to fluctuations in the atmospheric forcing. As a novelty, we show that for large regions of the world high-frequency anomalies in the monthly GRACE signal, which have been partly interpreted as noise, can be statistically reconstructed from daily precipitation once an adequate averaging filter is applied. This filter integrates the temporally decaying contribution of precipitation to the storage changes in any given month, including earlier precipitation.

The range of Zn uptake measured in biofilm during one light period in these laboratory experiments (0.6-8.3 mg Zn/g dw biofilm) encompassed the estimated Zn uptake (1.5-3.7 mg Zn/g dw biofilm) necessary to attribute aqueous diel Zn cycling in a mining-impacted stream in Montana (High Ore Creek) to uptake in biofilm. This is relevant to in situ studies of diel Zn cycling because we controlled three important parameters that naturally fluctuate daily in the field, thus demonstrating the potential for biofilm to remove large percentages of Zn from some mining-impacted streams.

In the proposed methodology, the feedforward control (FFC) policy is generated via nonlinear programming for simultaneous optimization of all control inputs under specified constraints. This family of optimized trajectories, which represent the best achievable performance of the plant under specified conditions, serve as tracking signals for the FF/FBC system, The Feedback control (FBC) law is synthesized following the H-infinity-based structured singular value (mu) approach to achieve the specified stability and performance robustness, The major features of the integrated FF/FBC system are 1) optimized performance over a wide operating range resulting from the feedforward element and 2) guaranteed stability and performance robustness resulting from the feedback element, To exemplify this control methodology, a family of FFC policies has been synthesized based on a nonlinear state-space model of a 525 MWe fossil-fueled power plant, The synthesis of an FFC policy is identified as an optimization problem where the performance is characterized by rapid maneuvering of electric power to meet the specified load demand while simultaneously maintaining the throttle steam temperature and pressure, and the hot reheat steam temperature within allowable ranges of variation, The results of simulation experiments show that the FF/FBC system satisfies the specified performance requirements of power ramp up and down in the range of 40%-100% load under nominal operating conditions. The results also suggest that this robust control law is capable of rejecting the anticipated disturbances such that the plant closely follows the optimal trajectory determined by the FFC policy, Although this research focuses on control and operation of fossil power plants, the proposed FF/FBC synthesis methodology is also applicable to other complex processes such as planned shutdown of nuclear power plants, take-off and landing of aircraft, and start-up and transient operations of rocket engines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1063-6536,,,,,JAN,1997,5,1,,,,,74,88,,10.1109/87.553666,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/87.553666,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997WB87500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The experiment was carried out under different rolling angles, periods and Reynolds numbers. Experimental results show that rolling motion induces periodical fluctuation of the flow rate, temperature of outlet water and outer wall surface. The fluctuation of relative flow rate increases with increasing rolling angle, while decreases with increasing rolling period and average Reynolds number. However, the amplitude of temperature fluctuation decreases initially and then increases, but finally decreases again as the average Reynolds number increases. This trend of temperature fluctuation is mainly affected by flow rate fluctuation amplitude and flow regime change due to fluctuating flow rate. In laminar and turbulent regions, since the flow regime has not changed, the temperature fluctuation amplitude is primarily affected by flow rate fluctuation amplitude, which decreases with average Reynolds number. When the flow reaches laminar turbulent transition region due to the relatively large amplitude of flow rate fluctuation caused by rolling motion, the flow in one period goes through laminar and turbulent regions. And the heat transfer coefficient changes considerably with average Reynolds number due to enhanced heat transfer in transition region. Thus, the temperature fluctuation amplitude is affected by the dominated factor, flow rate fluctuation amplitude or flow regime change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, as with sensors already used in temperature remote sensing (e.g., Landsat satellites), a radiance atmospheric correction is necessary to estimate land surface temperature. This is because atmospheric conditions at any sUAS flight elevation will have an adverse impact on the image accuracy, derived calculations, and study replicability using the microbolometer technology. This study presents a vicarious calibration methodology (sUAS-specific, time-specific, flight-specific, and sensor-specific) for sUAS temperature imagery traceable back to NIST-standards and current atmospheric correction methods. For this methodology, a three-year data collection campaign with a sUAS called AggieAir, developed at Utah State University, was performed for vineyards near Lodi, California, for flights conducted at different times (early morning, Landsat overpass, and mid-afternoon) and seasonal conditions. From the results of this study, it was found that, despite the spectral response of microbolometer cameras (7.0 to 14.0 m), it was possible to account for the effects of atmospheric and sUAS operational conditions, regardless of time and weather, to acquire accurate surface temperature data. In addition, it was found that the main atmospheric correction parameters (transmissivity and atmospheric radiance) significantly varied over the course of a day. These parameters fluctuated the most in early morning and partially stabilized in Landsat overpass and in mid-afternoon times. In terms of accuracy, estimated atmospheric correction parameters presented adequate statistics (confidence bounds under +/- 0.1 for transmissivity and +/- 1.2 W/m(2)/sr/um for atmospheric radiance, with a range of RMSE below 1.0 W/m(2)/sr/um) for all sUAS flights. Differences in estimated temperatures between original thermal image and the vicarious calibration procedure reported here were estimated from -5 degrees C to 10 degrees C for early morning, and from 0 to 20 degrees C for Landsat overpass and mid-afternoon times.",,,,,"Torres, Alfonso F./H-3998-2012","Torres, Alfonso F./0000-0002-2238-9550",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1424-8220,,,,JUL,2017,17,7,,,,,,,1499,10.3390/s17071499,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s17071499,,,,,,,,28672864,,,,,WOS:000407517600038,View Full Record in Web of Science

Field experiments were conducted to determine the effect of temperature on the postdispersal seed predation of four important weed species (Cuscuta compestris, Stellaria media, Taraxacum officinale and Veronica persica) in two lucerne fields in Mashhad and Chenaran, north-eastern Iran. These two cities have the same climate: temperate and cold alpine but the temperature varies between them. Wire mesh cages were used to determine the relative importance of birds in predation and pitfall traps were used to detect the species and the activity density of invertebrate predators. The results showed that the predation preference of different weed species was significantly different between and within fields. Seed predation fluctuated widely throughout the sampling periods, matching the periodic forage harvest and regrowth cycle of lucerne. Despite the level of seed predation fluctuating, it declined toward the last sampling periods. Using wire mesh exclusion cages showed no significant effect of birds on weed seed predation in both fields. Ants, crickets and carabid beetles were the invertebrate seed predators that were caught in the pitfall traps.

Coupled land-atmosphere simulations are then performed using CABLEv2.0.1 within the Australian Community Climate and Earth Systems Simulator (ACCESSv1.3b) with prescribed sea surface temperatures. As in most land surface models, the default stomatal conductance scheme only accounts for differences in model parameters in relation to the photosynthetic pathway but not in relation to plant functional types. The new scheme allows model parameters to vary by plant functional type, based on a global synthesis of observations of stomatal conductance under different climate regimes over a wide range of species. We show that the new scheme reduces the latent heat flux from the land surface over the boreal forests during the Northern Hemisphere summer by 0.5-1.0 mm day(-1). This leads to warmer daily maximum and minimum temperatures by up to 1.0 degrees C and warmer extreme maximum temperatures by up to 1.5 degrees C. These changes generally improve the climate model's climatology of warm extremes and improve existing biases by 10-20 %. The bias in minimum temperatures is however degraded but, overall, this is outweighed by the improvement in maximum temperatures as there is a net improvement in the diurnal temperature range in this region. In other regions such as parts of South and North America where ACCESSv1.3b has known large positive biases in both maximum and minimum temperatures (similar to 5 to 10 degrees C), the new scheme degrades this bias by up to 1 degrees C. We conclude that, although several large biases remain in ACCESSv1.3b for temperature extremes, the improvements in the global climate model over large parts of the boreal forests during the Northern Hemisphere summer which result from the new stomatal scheme, constrained by a global synthesis of experimental data, provide a valuable advance in the longterm development of the ACCESS modelling system.",,,,,"Medlyn, Belinda/O-5038-2019; Lorenz, Ruth/H-5386-2019; Pitman, Andrew J/A-7353-2011; Abramowitz, Gab/P-3969-2019; Wang, Yingping/A-9765-2011; De Kauwe, Martin/AAH-1304-2019; kala, Jatin/G-8408-2011","Medlyn, Belinda/0000-0001-5728-9827; Lorenz, Ruth/0000-0002-3986-1268; Pitman, Andrew J/0000-0003-0604-3274; Abramowitz, Gab/0000-0002-4205-001X; Wang, Yingping/0000-0002-4614-6203; De Kauwe, Martin/0000-0002-3399-9098; Lin, Yan-Shih/0000-0003-3177-5186; kala, Jatin/0000-0001-9338-2965",,,,,,,,,,,,,1991-959X,1991-9603,,,,,2015,8,12,,,,,3877,3889,,10.5194/gmd-8-3877-2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-3877-2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000367243700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are typically described by physiologically structured population models (PSPMs). Therefore, inverse modelling offers a tool to identify parameters of individual physiological processes through population-level data analysis, e. g. the temperature dependence of growth from size-frequency data of a field population. Here, we make use of experiments under laboratory conditions, in mesocosms and field monitoring to determine the temperature dependence of growth and mortality of Gammarus pulex. We found an optimum temperature for growth of approximately 17 degrees C and a related temperature coefficient, Q(10), of 1.5 degrees C-1, irrespective of whether we classically fitted individual growth curves or applied inverse modelling based on PSPMs to laboratory data. From a comparison of underlying data sets we conclude that applying inverse modelling techniques to population-level data results in meaningful response parameters for physiological processes if additional temperature-driven effects, including within-population interaction, can be excluded or determined independently. If this is not the case, parameter estimates describe a cumulative response, e. g. comprising temperature-dependent resource dynamics.

A wide range of scaling relationships has been observed globally for extreme daily and hourly precipitation, with evidence of scaling above 6.5% per K for sub-daily extreme precipitation in some regions(2-4). Only high-resolution climate models can simulate this scaling relationship(5). Here we examine the scaling of hourly extreme precipitation intensities in a future climate using experiments with a model for the southern UK with kilometre-scale resolution(6). Our model simulates the present-day scaling relationship at 6.5% per K, in agreement with observations. The simulated overall future increase in extreme precipitation follows the same relationship. However, UK extreme precipitation intensities decline at temperatures above about 22 degrees C-a temperature range that is not well sampled in the present-day integration-as a result of a more frequent occurrence of anticyclonic weather systems. Anticyclones produce more days with strong daytime heating, but are not favourable to the development of deep intense convective storms.

The air temperature obtained by the observations from surface meteorological stations is limited in their spatial and temporal representation, while the validated GDAS (Global Data Assimilation System) has many advantages, it can provide the simulated temperature data every 3 hours, and it has great value in downscaling analysis. There are three major driving factors of the near surface air temperature: the surface long-wave radiative balance, land-air turbulent heat exchange, and advection. The fluctuation of the Air temperature (2m height level above ground) mainly depends on underlying surface feedback. Northern China was chosen as the study area. Using air temperature data from the GDAS forcing dataset as a data source, we proposed a new method for downscaling air temperature based on land surface temperature. In order to evaluate the performance of our methods, bilinear interpolation, spline interpolation were used in the comparison. To assess the performance of the downscaling approaches, the ground measurements were used to compare with the downscaling results. Experiments show that the effect of static feedback interpolation is the best based on the surface temperature. What we have got are as follows. First, In most plain areas, the air temperature(2m height level above ground) mainly depends on the temperature of the surface temperature.

The distance between moxa stick and temperature sensor was set as 2 cm, 3 cm, 4 cm and 5 cm, respectively, by ruler. The temperature was recorded for once every 2 s with photothermal detection system for moxibustion combustion to form a temperature profile. The initial temperature, maximum temperature and average temperature were observed, and the experimental data were analyzed via SPSS18.0 statistical software. Results The initial receptor temperature was (25.33 +/- 0.29) degrees C when the moxibustion distance was 2 cm, (25.29 +/- 0.05) degrees C when the moxibustion distance was 3 cm, (25.43 +/- 0.17)degrees C when the moxibustion distance was 4cm, and (25.16 +/- 0.22) degrees C when the moxibustion distance was 5 cm, respectively.

A.",,,Thermal deformations and brightness temperature of the ice cover of freshwater bodies,LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW,,,,,,,,,,,,"The paper presents results of experimental studies of the deformation of a freshwater ice cover. The works were carried out on the Lake Arakhley located in the Trans-Baikal Region, where winters are characterized by small amount of snow and sharp daily changes in the air temperature reaching 25 degrees C. As a result of this, the temperature gradient of the surface layer of the ice cover exceeds 1 degrees C/cm. This causes formation of the dry cracks in the upper layers of the cover. The authors measured daily variations in the temperature of the ice cover at various depths by its thickness. Results of the experiment made possible to propose the explanation for the formation of dry cracks and the depth of them, which reaches 20 cm in the Trans-Baikal Region. According to studies using a differential strain gauge, it was found that the upper layer of the ice cover is in a stressed state due to changes in its temperature. This is evident from the fact that when the temperature of the upper layer of ice changes, the distance between the reference points slightly changes too. When the air temperature approaches the temperature of the ice-water phase transition, the ice cover is unloaded. We assume that the dry cracks can also be formed when the stress state of ice is released at even lower temperatures. Interest in these structural changes had been arisen in connection with possible variations in the electromagnetic properties of the ice cover, which can be detected by non-contact radio wave measurements. These variations result from the presence of a quasi-liquid layer on the surfaces of dry cracks (together with hoar-frost and snow in them), which can exist down to a temperature of -90 degrees C. Its presence increases the complex relative permittivity of a medium consisting of a solid (ice) and a liquid phase (water film). Calculations of the radiometric temperature within the centimeter range in a flat-layer non-isothermal medium have shown that the presence of dry cracks in the ice cover increases radio temperature up to 5 K on both, vertical and horizontal polarizations. This value is recorded during radiometric measurements, and this factor should be taken into account during the remote sensing of freshwater ice covers.",,,,,"Gurulev, Alexander A/S-4761-2017","Gurulev, Alexander A/0000-0003-2232-3583",,,,,,,,,,,,,2076-6734,2412-3765,,,,,2020,60,3,,,,,445,452,,10.31857/S2076673420030051,http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S2076673420030051,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000560480800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Conclusions: Flies reared at constant benign temperatures were more fecund at all acclimation temperatures. In contrast, flies reared under fluctuating natural or laboratory conditions were more successful in locating food under cool conditions in the field, while constant cool rearing conditions led to high cold resistance. The fluctuating-and low-temperature rearing conditions resulted in a similar metabolic profile, while the 24 degrees C rearing profile was distinct and showed a lack of plasticity. The effects of developmental acclimation on performance are therefore complex and cannot be captured through experimental comparisons of constant environments.",,,,,"Hoffmann, Ary/R-2972-2019; Hoffmann, Ary/C-2961-2011; Overgaard, Johannes/I-7493-2013; Malmendal, Anders/F-1198-2017; Kristensen, Torsten N/C-5031-2015; Overgaard, Johannes/AAA-3922-2022; Malmendal, Anders/S-2014-2019","Hoffmann, Ary/0000-0001-9497-7645; Overgaard, Johannes/0000-0002-2851-4551; Malmendal, Anders/0000-0002-8413-9717; Kristensen, Torsten N/0000-0001-6204-8753; Malmendal, Anders/0000-0002-8413-9717; Nielsen, Niels Chr./0000-0003-2978-4366",,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-0613,1937-3791,,,,,2012,14,7,,,,,821,837,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000322374000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper we address the problem of estimating the actual temperature of on-chip thermal sensor when the sensor reading has been corrupted by noise. Thermal sensors are prone to noise due to fabrication randomness, V-DD fluctuations etc. This causes discrepancy between actual temperature and the one predicted by thermal sensor. Our experiments estimate this variation to be around 30%. In this paper we present a statistical methodology for predicting the actual temperature for a given sensor reading. We present two techniques: single sensor prediction and multi-sensor prediction. The latter tries to estimate the actual temperature for each sensor (of the many on-chip sensors) simultaneously while exploiting the correlations between temperature and noise of different sensors. When the underlying randomness follows a Gaussian characteristic, we present optimal schemes of estimating the expected temperature. We also present heuristic schemes for the case where the Gaussian assumption fails to hold. The experiments showed that using our estimation schemes the RMS error can be reduce as much as 67% as compared to blindly trusting the sensors to be noise free.",,,,,,"SRIVASTAVA, ANKUR/0000-0002-5445-904X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0738-100X,,978-1-60558-497-3,,,,2009,,,,,,,472,477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000279394200096,View Full Record in Web of Science

Metabolic imbalances, disruptions in ion homeostasis and oxidative stress contribute to the increased mortality of chill-injured insects. Interestingly, survival can be significantly increased when chill-susceptible insects are exposed to a daily warm-temperature pulse during chilling. We hypothesize that warm pulses allow for the repair of damage associated with chill injury. Here, we describe transcriptional responses during exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime, relative to constant chilled temperatures, during pupal development in the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, using a combination of RNA-seq and qPCR. Pupae were exposed to either a constant, chilled temperature of 6 degrees C, or 6 degrees C with a daily pulse of 20 degrees C for 7 days. RNA-seq after experimental treatment revealed differential expression of transcripts involved in construction of cell membranes, oxidation-reduction and various metabolic processes. These mechanisms provide support for shared physiological responses to chill injury across taxa. The large number of differentially expressed transcripts observed after 7 days of treatment suggests that the initial divergence in expression profiles between the two treatments occurred upstream of the time point sampled. Additionally, the differential expression profiles observed in this study show little overlap with those differentially expressed during temperature stress in the diapause state of M. rotundata.

The Namib provides an ideal location for fundamental research that revisits some key assumptions in micrometeorology that are implicitly included in the parameterizations describing energy exchange in weather forecasting and climate models: homogenous flat surfaces, no vegetation, little moisture, and cloud-free skies create a strong and consistent diurnal forcing, resulting in a wide range of atmospheric stabilities. A novel combination of instruments was used to simultaneously measure variables and processes relevant to heat transfer: a 3-km fiber-optic distributed temperature sensor (DTS) was suspended in a pseudo-three-dimensional array within a 300 m x 300 m domain to provide vertical cross sections of air temperature fluctuations. Aerial and ground-based thermal imagers recorded high-resolution surface temperature fluctuations within the domain and revealed the spatial thermal imprint of atmospheric structures responsible for heat exchange. High-resolution soil temperature and moisture profiles together with heat flux plates provided information on near-surface soil dynamics. Turbulent heat exchange was measured with a vertical array of five eddy-covariance point measurements on a 21-m mast, as well as by collocated small- and large-aperture scintillometers.

The Mediterranean is one of the most sensitive regions in the world to climate change, specifically to changes in the temporal patterns of extreme temperature events, which are of increased intensity. This study focuses on the identification of potential spatial and temporal changes of extreme temperature events in the islands of Eastern Greece and Cyprus. Daily maximum and minimum surface air temperature values are extracted from seven island meteorological stations in Eastern Greece and from three stations in Cyprus. The period under examination extends from 1973 to 2010 and all stations exhibit higher than 97.8% overall data completeness. The assessment is based on a comprehensive set of thirteen extreme climate indices of temperature and on their statistical trends. The selected indices are examined for their annual values and account for the frequency, intensity and duration of the extreme temperature events. Two indices are related with fixed threshold temperature levels (25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and are defined as the number of days when a temperature value falls above a predefined threshold. Ten indices are percentile-based indicators, are site-specific and are associated with the 5th, 10th, 90th and 95th percentiles of the temperature distributions for each station. The duration of extreme temperature events is assessed using an additional index which refers to the maximum duration of consecutive hot days (>30 degrees C) within each year. Upon the calculation of the indices annual values, the resulting time series are analyzed for the presence of a trend using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test under the null hypothesis of no trend against the alternative hypothesis of a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend at the 0.001, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 significance levels. The linear slope is estimated using the Theil-Sen's non-parametric method, which is insensitive to outliers and significantly more accurate than the traditional linear regression method. The results signify the existence of the well-established warming signal over the experimental area. Statistical significant positive trends are identified for the warm nights and days indices and for the hot days and maximum duration of consecutive hot days.

We conducted a study to determine whether the variation in the response of seed banks to temperature varied across the latitudinal range of Taxodium distichum swamps in North America. Methods: The soil was collected in a long-term research network and heated experimentally to three current-day spring normal soil temperatures (average maximum daily spring normal soil temperatures during May in Illinois, Arkansas, and Louisiana, USA, respectively: 22 degrees, 25 degrees, and 29 degrees C). A normal is the mean temperature calculated over a 30-yr interval (1971-2000). Seed-bank density and biomass responses were examined in relation to latitude and difference in the soil temperature of the experiment and the spring normal. Key Results: Using first- and second-order regression analysis, we determined that the variation in total germination density was lowest mid-range and in experimental soil temperatures similar to the spring normal. For some dominant species, the variance in germination density was higher in the northern (Cephalanthus occidentalis) or the southern part of the network (Saururus cernuus and Polygonum pensylvanicum). Overall, the variance of total biomass (root, shoot, whole plant) was higher if the experimental soil temperature was warmer than the spring normal.

Precise measurement of hydroperiod features such as inundation timing and duration can help predict community dynamics and ecosystem stability. In areas defined by high spatial and temporal variability, fine-scale temporal variation in inundation timing and duration may drive community structure, but that variation may not be captured using common approaches including remote sensing technology. Here, we provide methods to accurately capture inundation timing by fitting hidden Markov models to measurements of daily temperature SD collected from temperature loggers. We describe a rugged housing design to protect loggers from physical damage and apply our methods to a group of intermittent ponds in southeastern Arizona, showing that initial pond inundation timing is highly variable across a small geographic scale (similar to 50 km(2)). We also compare a 1-logger (pond only) and 2-logger (pond + control) design and show that, although a single logger may be sufficient to capture inundation timing in most cases, a 2-logger design can increase confidence in results. These methods are cost-effective and show promise in capturing variation in intraregional inundation timing for a range of temporary lentic habitats that may have profound effects on aquatic communities, with implications for how these communities may respond to hydroperiod alteration from a changing climate.",,,,,,"Moore, Chloe/0000-0001-6255-199X; Gendreau, Kerry/0000-0001-6058-0893",,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,1944-7973,,,,NOV,2021,57,11,,,,,,,e2021WR029958,10.1029/2021WR029958,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021WR029958,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000723106900060,View Full Record in Web of Science

Phase change material (PCM) is a latent heat storage system that can store and release the heat energy by changing its phase from liquid to solid and solid to liquid respectively. Therefore, use of PCM inside the refrigerator cabinet has the potential for minimizing the temperature fluctuation during the door opening and the power failure. However, very few studies in the literature were dedicated to investigating the role of PCM to reduce the temperature fluctuation. The aim of this work is to experimentally investigate the effects of PCM on temperature fluctuation inside the cabinet of a household refrigerator during the door opening and power failure. The results found that a significantly lower temperature fluctuation can be obtained using PCM. It was found that during the door opening condition the air temperature in the cabinet rose rapidly. However, when a PCM container was used, temperature variation was reduced to 3-5 degrees C. During the power failure, the system with PCM maintained a lower temperature inside the storage chamber for a long period of time (about 2 hours). Moreover, the test results indicate that PCM maintains more stable temperature in the foodstuffs inside the refrigerator. This reduction of temperature fluctuation ultimately improves the quality of preserved food.",,,,,"Khan, Dr. Md Imran H./AAD-9396-2022","Khan, Dr. Md Imran H./0000-0002-1357-9467; Karim, Azharul/0000-0001-9074-0384",,,,,,,,,,,,,1543-5075,1543-5083,,,,,2017,14,4,,,,,379,384,,10.1080/15435075.2016.1261705,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2016.1261705,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000394453900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The concept of the variable fraction of the daily spawning females with spawning markers at a sampling time t (FDSMt), which varies diurnally in relation to the duration of the spawning markers and the spawning time frequency distribution, was introduced. Spawning fraction can be calculated as S = Psm(t) x (1/FDSMt). where Psm(t) is the observed fraction of active females with signs of previous or imminent spawnings, referring to various spawning markers, at a sampling time t. Simulations suggested the following two methods were robust when the spawning time frequency distribution was long and uncertain. The first refers to sampling females evenly throughout the 24h period, whilst the second is based on selecting a single or combination of spawning markers so that the total temperature-adjusted marker duration at sampling sums to around 24h and applying, if necessary, a correction factor. With these methods, the influence of sampling time and spawning time frequency distribution can be ignored. The utility of the second method was evaluated with field data for Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus.

Very high resolution (VHR) narrow-band multispectral (10 cm) and thermal (20 cm) imagery was acquired diurnally, in four airborne campaigns conducted over an experimental vineyard site undergoing three different irrigation treatments. Field measurements of leaf stomatal conductance (G(s)) and leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)) were acquired concurrently with the airborne campaigns and compared against the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), a widely accepted, thermal-based indicator of water stress, and against narrow-band multispectral indices calculated from pure-vegetation pixels. The study proposes a new formulation, a normalized PRI (PRInorm), in which the standard PRI index is normalized by an index that is sensitive to canopy structure (Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index, RDVI) and by a red edge index that is sensitive to chlorophyll content (R-700/R-670). The hypothesis investigated is that the new index, calculated as PRInorm = PRI/[RDVI center dot R-700/R-670], not only detects xanthophyll pigment changes as a function of water stress, but also normalizes for the chlorophyll content level and canopy leaf area reduction induced by stress. Results demonstrated that when comparing PRInorm against stomatal conductance (r(2) = 0.79; p <0.001) and leaf water potential (r(2) = 0.77; p < 0.001) measured at midday, the new index performed better than the standard PRI (r(2) = 0.52 and 0.49, respectively). Further, when using the four flights conducted during the diurnal experiment, the relationships with stomatal conductance also showed the superior performance of PRInorm (r(2) = 0.68) as opposed to PRI (r(2) = 0.4). The proposed normalized PRI was highly related (r(2) = 0.75; p <0.001) to the thermal indicator of water stress, CWSI, which was used here as a benchmark. In comparison, the standard PRI index was found to be significantly related to CWSI (p < 0.001), although the relationship was weaker (r(2) = 0.58) than that obtained for PRInorm. In summary, this study demonstrates that PRInorm isolated better than PRI the physiological changes against a changing background of altered pigments and structure, tracking more precisely the diurnal dynamics of the stomatal aperture. Simulations conducted, using leaf and canopy radiative transfer models to elucidate these results, showed that PRInorm is more linearly related to canopy pigment content than the standard PRI, and was more capable of differentiating between stress levels, providing better insight into the results of this diurnal study.

Although climate change may skew sex ratios in species with TSD, few available methods predict sex under natural conditions, fewer still are based on mechanistic hypotheses of development, and field tests of existing methods are rare. We propose a new approach that calculates the probability of masculinization (PM) in natural nests. This approach subsumes the mechanistic hypotheses describing the outcome of TSD, by integrating embryonic development with the temperature-dependent reaction norm for sex determination. Further, we modify a commonly used method of sex ratio estimation, the constant temperature equivalent (CTE), to provide quantitative estimates of sex ratios. We test our new approaches using snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina). We experimentally manipulated nests in the field, and found that the PM method is better supported than the modified CTE, explaining 69% of the variation in sex ratios across 27 semi-natural nests. Next, we used the PM method to predict variation in sex ratios across 14 natural nests over 2 years, explaining 67% of the variation. We suggest that the PM approach is effective and broadly applicable to species with TSD, particularly for forecasting how sex ratios may respond to climate change. Interestingly, we also found that the modified CTE explained up to 64% of variation in sex ratios in a Type II TSD species, suggesting that our modifications will be useful for future research.

Male SPF Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups for this experiment, control group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 25 degrees C), NC + 2 degrees C group (altitude, 1400 m, temperature, 2 degrees C), HH group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 25 degrees C), HH+2 degrees C group (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 2 degrees C) and HH + 12/2 degrees C (altitude, 6000 m, temperature, 12 degrees C/2 degrees C light/dark cycle). After exposure for 72 h, the blood and brain tissues were collected. Brain water content (BWC) and Evans Blue dye extravasation were used to assess the brain edema and bloodbrain barrier (BBB) permeability, respectively. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum were assessed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Oxidative stress markers and ATPase activity were determined using commercial kits. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of related proteins. Compared to control, HH+2 degrees C could significantly increase the BWC and BBB permeability, and these changes were further exacerbated by HH + 12/2 degrees C. Furthermore, HH+2 degrees C and HH + 12/2 degrees C markedly increased the levels of H2O2 and MDA, restrained SOD and GSH levels and decreased Na+/K+-ATPase activitie compared with the control group. In addition, HH+2 degrees C and HH + 12/2 degrees C enhanced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 in serum and significantly increased the expression of VEGF in brain compared with the control group, but only HH + 12/2 degrees C could increase the expression of AQP4. However, compared with control group, no significant differences in these parameters were observed in HH and NC+2 degrees Cgroups. These results demonstrated that HH or cold stress alone did not successfully induce brain damage, while HH+2 degrees C could induce the onset of HACE via provoking injury caused by HH.

In particular, exposure to a daily temperature cycle, even within rest shelters, may be important in timing of torpor and arousal and determining resting energy costs in wild animals. We tested how captive bats (Nyctophilus geoffroyi; 7 g) exposed to a diurnal T-a fluctuation (between 13 degrees C and 27 degrees C), similar to natural conditions in their summer tree roosts, adjusted the timing of daily arousals. To distinguish the effects of Ta and passive rewarming from time of the day, we shifted the heating phase to commence at 06:00h, 09: 00h or 12: 00h on each day. Bats entered torpor overnight and aroused the next day at a time corresponding to rising Ta and passive rewarming. The critical T-a (and torpid T-b) for arousal was not fixed, however, but was lower when heating occurred later in the rest phase, providing the first evidence that the critical arousal Ta is affected by time of the day. Bats re-entered torpor in response to cooling late in the afternoon, yet always aroused at lights off. A period of normothermic thermoregulation was therefore closely synchronised with maximum daily T-a, indicating a trade-off between the benefits and energetic costs of normothermia during resting. Our experiment clearly shows that a daily T-a cycle affects the thermoregulatory behaviour and energetics of these small bats. More generally, these results demonstrate the critical influence of behavioural decisions on the daily energy expenditure of small heterothermic mammals.",,,,,"Geiser, Fritz/O-4175-2018","Geiser, Fritz/0000-0001-7621-5049; Koertner, Gerhard/0000-0001-8230-0709; Turbill, Christopher/0000-0001-9810-7102",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,DEC 15,2008,211,24,,,,,3871,3878,,10.1242/jeb.023101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.023101,,,,,,,,19043059,,,,,WOS:000261260500016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Environmental variability is important to characterize because it can amplify or dampen the biological consequences of global change, depending on the functional relationship between mean temperature or pH and organismal traits. Here, we characterize the spatiotemporal variability of pH, temperature, and salinity at fringing reefs in Moorea, French Polynesia and Nanwan Bay, Taiwan using advanced time series analysis, including wavelet analysis, and infer their potential impact on the persistence and stability of coral populations. Our results demonstrate that both the mean and variance of pH and temperature differed significantly between sites in Moorea and Taiwan. Seawater temperature at the Moorea site passed the local bleaching threshold several times within the similar to 45 day deployment while aragonite saturation state at the Taiwan site was often below commonly observed levels for coral reefs. Our results showcase how a better understanding of the differences in environmental conditions between sites can (1) provide an important frame of reference for designing laboratory experiments to study the effects of environmental variability, (2) identify the proximity of current environmental conditions to predicted biological thresholds for the coral reef, and (3) help predict when the temporal variability and mean of environmental conditions will interact synergistically or antagonistically to alter the abundance and stability of marine populations experiencing climate change.",,,,,"Gouhier, Tarik/C-3611-2009; /AAL-3738-2021","Gouhier, Tarik/0000-0002-9537-7358",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,MAR 23,2015,10,3,,,,,,,e0121742,10.1371/journal.pone.0121742,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121742,,,,,,,,25799322,,,,,WOS:000351987300288,View Full Record in Web of Science

The periodically fluctuating behavior of indoor air temperature, which characterizes the indoor thermal environment, is not determined from the earth-air tube system alone but by the coupling of earth-air tube ventilation and the thermal mass contained in a building. A model for the coupling effects of earth-air tube ventilation and building thermal mass on periodically fluctuating air temperature has been previously developed (Yang et al., Energy and Buildings 81: 182-199, 2014). This paper integrates both the yearly and daily fluctuations of air temperature into unified equations. A method for determining the penetration depth of the oscillating tube-air temperature wave in the surrounding soil is proposed to enhance the model accuracy. An experiment was conducted to test the model, and the model predictions show good agreement with the measured data. The roles played by the key engineering parameters with respect to the overall efficiency of the combined system were analyzed. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of an earth-air tube ventilation system cannot be quantified in isolation from the building characteristics.

Some CCW is bypassed, blocked, and used as a thermal capacity medium, and the temperature fluctuation of CCW is significantly reduced by heat exchanging with the medium. The temperature of the medium dynamically follows the set value of the CCW temperature by real time updating, and so realizes a quick CCW temperature control response. The attenuation ratio of temperature fluctuation was derived, theoretically validating the effectiveness of the method. The experimental results indicate that a CCW temperature fluctuation attenuation ratio of tens of dB (-3.47 dB, -6.91 dB, -10.97 dB and -15.28 dB corresponding to temperature fluctuation frequencies of 0.01 Hz, 0.025 Hz, 0.053 Hz and 0.105 Hz, respectively) is achieved by the proposed method. The updating time of thermal capacity medium is 82 s, which means that the temperature fluctuation attenuation remains functionally valid when the set value of CCW changes.

Findings for the mesosphere must be based on large sets of pairings because an individual HALOE T( p) measurement is somewhat noisy and may not view the same atmospheric structure. Simulated estimates of total bias errors for the HALOE profiles are of the order of 2% (or 5 K). The average biases with the lidar profiles at 44degreesN, 6degreesE are within 3 K from 33 to 66 km and 4 K to 74 km, at least when zonal easterlies (and reduced wave activity) prevail. Tidal effects can account for most of that difference. Comparisons with shipboard lidar soundings that begin near 100 km indicate no significant bias even in the 77 to 85 km range. Similar comparisons with falling sphere profiles at Cape Canaveral and Wallops Island indicate no significant bias from 40 to 66 km and 71 to 85 km. HALOE profiles are warmer than sphere values from 67 to 70 km, but this is also the altitude region where the sphere profile has greater uncertainties. For those months when the lidar soundings indicate inversion layers the sets of profiles paired with lidar indicate that the HALOE T( p) is somewhat colder in the upper mesosphere, in part owing to the effects of limb path averaging of horizontal structure by HALOE and its inability to completely resolve the inversion layer maximum. On the basis of the combined sets of findings it is concluded that most of the error in a single HALOE T(p) is random, except where there is a sharp inversion. Daily zonal averages of the HALOE profiles are accurate and useful for defining the seasonal and longer-term variations of T(p) in the mesosphere.",,,,,"Keckhut, Philippe/AFO-0077-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0747-7309,,,,,SEP-OCT,2002,107,D20,,,,,,,4447,10.1029/2001JD001521,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JD001521,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000180466200119,View Full Record in Web of Science

Determining TSD thermal ecology is important to understanding sex ratio evolution in those species, as TSD systems may pose a challenge to Fisherian models that predict the production of 1:1 sex ratios through frequency-dependent selection. Unfortunately, the relationship between fluctuating temperatures and sex in nature remains poorly understood. Here I present a novel statistical model of TSD in the endangered Amazonian freshwater turtle, Podocnemis expansa. designed to account for heterogeneous daily fluctuations of natural nest temperatures by comparing laboratory and field data on sex ratios, developmental stages, cumulative temperature units (CTUs), and time spent below the survival threshold (28 degreesC). Experiments encompassed constant, shift-once, and shift-twice temperatures in the laboratory, plus depth and shading treatments in the field. A constant temperature of 32.6 degreesC produced 1: 1 males : females, the highest pivotal temperature ever reported for a turtle species. The thermosensitive period for sex determination (TSP) roughly occurs during developmental stages 17-24 as determined from shift experiments. The CTUs during the TSP plus the number of hours below 28 degreesC prior to the TSP significantly explained sex ratio production in the combined laboratory and field data set (positive and negative effects, respectively). However, the relationship for field nests only was not significant. Higher temperatures had a disproportionately larger effect on female production in the combined field and laboratory data set. Depth and shading had drastic effects on nest temperature, embryonic development, and sex ratio. Seasonal climate changes can override the effect of nest depth via differences in oviposition time. Two of the shaded nests experienced the coldest temperatures of all field nests but yielded the highest female proportion, according to a TSDII pattern (when females are produced at low and high temperatures and males are produced at intermediate temperatures). Thus Podocnemis expansa may be a TSDII species, but this intrinsic system seems to be realized as TSDIa in nature (males produced at low temperatures and females produced at high temperatures), because of the general lethality of cold temperatures which precludes the production of low-temperature females.",,,,,,"Valenzuela, Nicole/0000-0003-1148-631X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,NOV,2001,82,11,,,,,3010,3024,,10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[3010:CSANTE]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082[3010:CSANTE]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000172139500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cosinor rhythmometry procedure was used to determine the rhythmic parameters of ambient temperature and haematochemical parameters. To determine the effect of time of day on the rhythmicity of the studied parameters, as well as their seasonality, repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. The results showed that in spite of the nychthemeral profile presented by the ambient temperature for each season, the body temperature remained in a narrow range, thus indicating a successful thermoregulation. The rhythmometry analysis showed a circadian rhythmicity of ambient temperature and haematochemical parameters with diurnal acrophases. A statistically significant effect of the time of day was shown on all studied haematochemical parameters, except on creatininemia. It was also found that only uremia, cholesterolemia and triglyceridemia followed the seasonal sexual activity of the studied ruminant.

I investigated the effects of fluctuating temperature on N mineralization and nitrification in an Oxisol, and established a method that takes this effect into account by using current information obtained from experiments carried out at constant temperatures. Soil incubations were made with and without NH4 addition at three constant temperatures (20, 30 and 40 degreesC) and three fluctuating temperature patterns (FTP). The mean temperature of the FTP was 30 degreesC. Two FTP had a large temperature amplitude (8 h at 20 degreesC, 8 h at 30 degreesC, 8 h at 40 degreesC, FTP1, and 12 h at 20 degreesC, 12 h at 40 degreesC, FTP2) and the third was an actual pattern observed at the field with a near-sinusoidal wave and a small amplitude (27.1-33.2 degreesC, FTP3). Nitrogen mineralization obeyed first order kinetics and nitrification was linear against time with an initial period of NH4 immobilization. Nitrogen mineralization was higher for FTP 1 and FTP2 than for FTP3 or constant 30 degreesC. The temperature response of the constant rate of N mineralization was fitted to the Q 10 equation. Calculations performed with the parameters obtained at constant temperature applied to the FTP described the experimental data well. This suggests that the differences between FTP 1, FTP2 and constant 30 degreesC were due to the non-linear response of the constant rate of N mineralization to temperature. In other words, microbial activity at a given temperature was the same under FTP and at constant temperature. Similar results were obtained for nitrification but the differences between FTP and constant 30 degreesC were less. Daily mean temperature was not suitable for estimating daily N mineralization and nitrification when the temperature amplitude was large and I propose a method based on the use of daily mean rates. For a small daily temperature amplitude, the use of the daily mean temperature seems appropriate because it results in only a small bias which is less than the uncertainties associated with the estimate of the rates of soil microbial processes.

Even when the purpose of the study was to investigate effects of temperature, insects have mostly been kept at different but constant temperatures ignoring natural variation in temperature. Here we investigated effects of simple daily temperature fluctuation (22.5/27.5 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C) on some development characteristics in five species of fruit flies (Drosophila) originating from areas with different temperature profiles. We demonstrated how species of the same genus can show substantial differences when developing at fluctuating temperatures not always predictable by development at comparable constant temperature (25 degrees C). Temperature has profound effects on biochemical processes as suggested by the extensive variation in performance of organisms across temperatures. Nonetheless, the use of fluctuating temperature (FT) regimes in laboratory experiments compared to constant temperature (CT) regimes is still mainly applied in studies of model organisms. We investigated how two amplitudes of developmental temperature fluctuation (22.5/27.5 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C, 12/12 h) affected several fitness-related traits in five Drosophila species with markedly different thermal resistance. Egg-to-adult viability did not change much with temperature except in the cold-adapted D. immigrans. Developmental time increased with FT among all species compared to the same mean CT. The impact of FT on wing size was quite diverse among species. Whereas wing size decreased quasi-linearly with CT in all species, there were large qualitative differences with FT. Changes in wing aspect ratio due to FT were large compared to the other traits and presumably a consequence of thermal stress. These results demonstrate that species of the same genus but with different thermal resistance can show substantial differences in responses to fluctuating developmental temperatures not predictable by constant developmental temperatures. Testing multiple traits facilitated the interpretation of responses to FT in a broader context.",,,,,"Pertoldi, Cino/I-1746-2012","Pertoldi, Cino/0000-0002-4644-8981",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2075-4450,,,,OCT,2021,12,10,,,,,,,925,10.3390/insects12100925,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects12100925,,,,,,,,34680694,,,,,WOS:000715253400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

So a multi-scale simulating method of the temperature on braided FRC plate is built in this paper, considering the temperature fluctuations of braided structures. The effective model of braided plate and the periodic braided structure are built, to obtain the homogenized temperature field and the fluctuations of temperature, respectively. The Fourier series is applied to build the functions of temperature fluctuations. Then the reconstructed temperature field of braided FRC plate could be obtained based on the homogenized temperature field and the functions of temperature fluctuations. Finally, the temperature field with fluctuations based on the braided model of whole plate is also simulated and compared with the reconstructed temperature field, to validate the accuracy of multi-scale thermal analysis method. Additionally, the experiment of temperature test on the braided FRC plate is also carried out to validate the accuracy of simulation, which presented good accuracy. The results show that, the temperature distribution of the braided FRC plate has significant fluctuating characteristics, the temperature in the region with braided yarns is relatively lower comparing with that in the matrix region, and the distributions of fluctuations are highly similar to the braided structures. The homogenized model based on the effective thermal conductivities could not obtain the temperature fluctuations of braided FRC plate. The maximum temperature difference between the braided model and the homogenized model reaches 25.37 K. Finally the maximum relative variation between the reconstructed temperature distribution and the temperature distribution based on the braided model is 3.18%, so the multi-scale thermal analysis method in this paper has good accuracy in simulating the temperature distribution of braided FRC plate with fluctuations.

This is done by using local estimates of first and second moments of the joint specific humidity-potential temperature-distribution in a Monte-Carlo-integration of the relevant processes. Simulation of cirrus and low level cloudiness has been done within the frame of EUCREX (European Cloud and Radiation Experiment). With the new scheme, a part of the given grid volume can be supersaturated and condensation or ice formation occurs without a supersaturation of the entire volume to be realized. This produces more frequent and earlier cloud water (q(1)) and cloud ice (q(i)) and results in an increase in time-average cloud activity. The domain averaged values q(1) and q(i) using the new scheme remain larger most of the time and are appreciable after the time they are approximately zero when no subgrid fluctuations are considered. The assumption that local condensation can occur in the presence of turbulent fluctuations, even though the average state is below saturation, is part of a general effort to improve sub-scale cloud modeling.

This study examined the variation of surface temperatures of broilers through two dynamic air velocity treatments under hot summer conditions. It was discovered that the surface temperatures varied over age, daytime, and environmental factors (air temperature, relative humidity, and temperature humidity index). A simple linear regression model to predict the surface temperature of heavy broilers was developed. The findings from this study will enhance knowledge to understand the broilers' responses under heat stress, which will be helpful in providing necessary management decisions to create a comfortable thermal environment. Heavy broilers exposed to hot summer conditions experience fluctuations in surface temperatures due to heat stress, which leads to decreased performance. Maintaining a bird's homeostasis depends on several environmental factors (temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity). It is important to understand the responses of birds to environmental factors and the amount of heat loss to the surrounding environment to create thermal comfort for the heavy broilers for improved performances and welfare. This study investigates the variation in surface temperatures of heavy broilers under high and low air velocity treatments. Daytime, age and bird location's effect on the surface temperature variation was also examined. The experiment was carried out in the poultry engineering laboratory of North Carolina State University during summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019 as a part of a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of wind chill application to mitigate heat stress on heavy broilers. This live broiler heat stress experiment was conducted under two dynamic air velocity treatments (high and low) with three chambers per treatment and 44 birds per chamber. Surface temperatures of the birds were recorded periodically through the experimental treatment cycles (flocks, 35-61 d) with infrared thermography in the morning, noon, evening, and nighttime. The overall mean surface temperature of the broilers under two treatments was found to be 35.89 +/- 2.37 degrees C. The variation in surface temperature happened due to air temperature, thermal index, air velocity, bird's age, daytime, and position of birds inside the experimental chambers. The surface temperatures were found lower under high air velocity treatment and higher under low air velocity treatment. During the afternoon time, the broilers' surface temperatures were higher than other times of the day. It was also found that the birds' surface temperature increased with age and temperature humidity indices. Based upon the experimental data of five flocks, a simple linear regression model was developed to predict surface temperature from the birds' age, thermal indices, and air velocity.

However, the effect of temperature fluctuation on phytoplankton is rarely considered. We analyzed the effect of fluctuating temperature on cyanobacterial dominance and blooms in spring (March-May) with long-term data analyses, laboratory simulation, and field observation. Our results showed that the magnitude of air temperature fluctuation in spring has increased in Lake Taihu over the past 58 years (1956-2013) and was negatively correlated with cyanobacterial blooms onset time (1987-2013). Air temperature fluctuation was one of the predictors of the best model for the variability in the bloom size in spring (2000-2011). The results from the field observation (2009-2013) also indicated that there was a positive correlation between diel air temperature difference and the ratio of cyanobacteria to total algae. Laboratory experiments suggested that water temperature fluctuation slowed the growth rates of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Cyclotella meneghiniana but not Microcystis aeruginosa, which confirmed our findings of field observation and long-term data analysis.

The results revealed that: (1) The average soil moisture content of JBM was greater than that of CT by 3.76% and 2.34%, respectively, during the 2013 and 2014 jujube growth periods, and its soil water deficit was minimal in each soil layer from 0 to 70 cm. WCP had the greatest soil water deficit. The average soil moisture content of the 0-70 cm soil layer in WCP was 3.88% and 5.55% lower than that in CT during the 2013 and 2014 jujube growth seasons, respectively (p < 0.05). (2) JBM had the highest annual average soil moisture content in each soil layer from 0 to 70 cm, followed by CT, while WCP had the lowest. White clover and jujube competed for water in the 20-40 cm soil layer, and JBM had the lowest variation in soil moisture. (3) Mulching with jujube branches and planting white clover could both control the temperature of the 0-25 cm soil layer and narrow the daily temperature range, with JBM being the least affected by air temperature. (4) Jujube's leaf area index and stem diameter increase in JBM were both significantly greater than in CT and WCP.

Many insect species have fixed degree-days for embryogenesis, with minimum and maximum temperature thresholds for egg and larval development and hatching. Often, photoperiodic changes trigger the transfer into the next life-cycle stadium. However, it is not known whether this distinct pattern also exist in a species with a high level of phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits. In the present study, eggs of the dragonfly Sympetrum striolatumCharpentier (Odonata: Libellulidae) are reared under different constant and fluctuating temperatures and photoperiodic conditions in several laboratory and field experiments. In general, and as expected, higher temperatures cause faster egg development. However, no general temperature or light-days for eyespot development and hatching are found. The minimum temperature thresholds are distinguished for survival (2 degrees C), embryogenesis (6 degrees C) and larval hatching (above 6 degrees C). Low winter temperatures synchronize hatching. Above 36 degrees C, no eyespots are visible and no larvae hatch. In laboratory experiments, light is neither necessary for eyespot development, nor for hatching. By contrast to the laboratory experiments, the field experiment show that naturally changing temperature and photoperiod play a significant role in the seasonal regulation of embryonic development. The post-eyespot development is more variable and influenced by temperature and photoperiod than the pre-eyespot development. This developmental plasticity at the end of the embryogenesis might be a general pattern in the Libellulidae, helping them to cope with variation in environmental conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0307-6962,1365-3032,,,,MAR,2015,40,1,,,,,90,101,,10.1111/phen.12091,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/phen.12091,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000349993900011,View Full Record in Web of Science

It was very difficult, however, to detect the FILCT temperature if the applied magnetic field was in an unstable state. Additionally, if the initial bias is higher, it is more difficult to detect the FILCT temperature because the resolution of the lock-in amplifier is reduced. In order to improve the accuracy of low-invasive temperature measurement, we formulated a method that reduces the drift in the pickup coil voltage caused by instability from the applied magnetic field.

Five of the 7 models considered in our validation exercise are found to have fair skill as regards their ability to simulate the broad features of present-day observed surface climatological features over the SIS in the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The transient experiments with these models, which include the time-varying future anthropogenic radiative forcings, have been used here to develop regional projections of future climate change. An area-averaged annual mean warming of ca 2degreesC or higher for the 2050s and ca 3degreesC or higher for the 2080s are projected for the SIS as a consequence of increases in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. In general, seasonal variations of the projected surface warming over the SIS are minimal. No significant change in diurnal temperature range is likely with an increase in surface temperatures. An increase in mean temperature would be accompanied by an increase in the frequency of extremely high temperatures. The aerosol forcing will only marginally reduce the surface warming. The models simulate only a marginal change (<10%) in annual mean rainfall over most of the SIS, During the northern hemisphere summer, however, rainfall is projected to decline (except over Pacific Ocean islands). An increase in daily rainfall intensity leading to more heavy rainfall events is also projected. The projected changes in temperature and rainfall could disrupt the terrestrial and marine ecosystems in most SIS. An integrated study of vulnerability assessment for SIS based on a better understanding of the precise magnitude of increase in surface air temperature and associated sea level rise is warranted for developing appropriate adaptation strategies.",,,,,"TAKAHASHI, KIYOSHI/AAD-5992-2019","TAKAHASHI, KIYOSHI/0000-0002-0163-545X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0936-577X,,,,,JAN 16,2002,19,3,,,,,179,192,,10.3354/cr019179,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr019179,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000174335500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Stelzer, CP",,,,"Stelzer, Claus-Peter",,,Competition between two planktonic rotifer species at different temperatures: an experimental test,FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. The effect of temperature on the outcome of resource competition between two planktonic rotifers (Synchaeta pectinata and Brachionus calyciflorus) was investigated in laboratory experiments. In addition to the competition experiments, several physiological variables and their temperature-dependence were characterised, including ingestion rate and starvation tolerance. 2. Because of a lower threshold food level (TFL) for population growth for the food algae Cryptomonas erosa, Synchaeta was predicted to be the superior competitor at low temperatures (12 degrees C). In contrast, Brachionus had a lower TFL at 20 degrees C and was predicted to be competitively superior at this temperature. 3. In both rotifer species, ingestion rates increased with temperature, but the increase was much more pronounced in Brachionus. Ingestion rates of Brachionus at temperatures from 8 to 24 degrees C were always higher than in Synchaeta (up to 4.6-fold). 4. Starvation resistance reduced with temperature in both rotifer species. At all temperatures investigated (12,16 and 20 degrees C) Brachionus could survive starvation for longer than Synchaeta. This difference was strongest at 12 degrees C (5.8 days versus 2.5 days). 5. In the first competition experiment, food was supplied at 48 h-intervals. Brachionus displaced Synchaeta at both experimental temperatures (12 and 20 degrees C). Competitive exclusion of Synchaeta at the lower temperature was probably because of large fluctuations in algal densities that resulted from the long intervals between feeding, a condition that favoured Brachionus because of its higher starvation resistance. 6. In the second competition experiment, one third of the food suspension was renewed every 8 h, resulting in a much better approximation to a continuous resource supply. At 12 degrees C Synchaeta and Brachionus coexisted for more than I month and the densities of both rotifer species were significantly lower in the presence of their competitor. In contrast to expectations, Brachionus was able to persist even when Cryptomonas concentrations fell below its TFL. This was probably because Brachionus was using detritus and associated bacteria as additional food sources, which were present in the cultures during the later phase of the experiment. 7. Autocorrelation analysis of the temporal changes in egg ratios revealed significant periodic cycles in Synchaeta during the second competition experiment. A possible explanation for this is the fecundity schedule of Synchaeta, in which reproduction is highly concentrated in a few age classes. According to demographic theory, such a life cycle feature can cause slower convergence to a stable age distribution.",,,,,"Stelzer, Claus-Peter/F-3789-2018","Stelzer, Claus-Peter/0000-0002-6682-0904",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,DEC,2006,51,12,,,,,2187,2199,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01632.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01632.x,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000242487400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, the green algae Neochloris oleoabundans and Scenedesmus dimorphus were grown in tightly-controlled turbidostat-based photobioreactors to determine the potential benefits of temperature control for biomass production of these organisms versus allowing these cultures to experience temperature fluctuations similar to what would be found in uncontrolled, outdoor open ponds or closed bioreactors. The results of these studies indicate stark differences between these two strains, with N. oleoabundans yielding improved growth rates under conditions of stringent temperature control at 22 degrees C, while S. dimorphus yielded slightly higher growth under conditions where temperature was allowed to fluctuate based on modeled natural temperature profiles. Further analysis reveals that the utilization of non-conventional temperature profiles could enhance growth yields further for N. oleoabundans, allowing it to overcome the detrimental effects of the natural temperature fluctuation.

It is an online model in which the dust aerosol dynamics and physics are solved at each model time step. The companion paper (P,rez et al., 2011) develops the dust model parameterizations and provides daily to annual evaluations of the model for its global and regional configurations. Modeled aerosol optical depth (AOD) was evaluated against AERONET Sun photometers over Northern Africa, Middle East and Europe with correlations around 0.6-0.7 on average without dust data assimilation. In this paper we analyze in detail the behavior of the model using data from the Saharan Mineral dUst experiment (SAMUM-1) in 2006 and the Bod,l, Dust Experiment (BoDEx) in 2005. AOD from satellites and Sun photometers, vertically resolved extinction coefficients from lidars and particle size distributions at the ground and in the troposphere are used, complemented by wind profile data and surface meteorological measurements. All simulations were performed at the regional scale for the Northern African domain at the expected operational horizontal resolution of 25 km. Model results for SAMUM-1 generally show good agreement with satellite data over the most active Saharan dust sources. The model reproduces the AOD from Sun photometers close to sources and after long-range transport, and the dust size spectra at different height levels. At this resolution, the model is not able to reproduce a large haboob that occurred during the campaign. Some deficiencies are found concerning the vertical dust distribution related to the representation of the mixing height in the atmospheric part of the model. For the BoDEx episode, we found the diurnal temperature cycle to be strongly dependant on the soil moisture, which is underestimated in the NCEP analysis used for model initialization. The low level jet (LLJ) and the dust AOD over the Bod,l, are well reproduced. The remaining negative AOD bias (due to underestimated surface wind speeds) can be substantially reduced by decreasing the threshold friction velocity in the model.",,,,,"todd, martin/I-4143-2015; Tesche, Matthias/S-6848-2019; MUELLER, DETLEF/F-1010-2015; Miller, Ron L/E-1902-2012; Baldasano, Jose M./A-3852-2016; Weinzierl, Bernadett/G-5319-2012; Jorba, Oriol/AAW-2134-2020","Tesche, Matthias/0000-0003-0096-4785; MUELLER, DETLEF/0000-0002-0203-7654; Miller, Ron L/0000-0003-2122-0443; Baldasano, Jose M./0000-0002-6191-635X; Weinzierl, Bernadett/0000-0003-4555-5686; Jorba, Oriol/0000-0001-5872-0244; Washington, Richard/0000-0003-2521-4614; Perez Garcia-Pando, Carlos/0000-0002-4456-0697; nickovic, slobodan/0000-0003-3603-5515; Basart, Sara/0000-0002-9821-8504",,,,,,,,,,,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,2012,12,6,,,,,2933,2958,,10.5194/acp-12-2933-2012,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-12-2933-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000302178000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

During commercial production, Phalaenopsis are usually grown at an air temperature >= 28 degrees C to inhibit flower initiation, and a cooler night than day temperature regimen (e.g. 25/20 degrees C day/night) is used to induce flowering. However, the specific effect of day and night temperature on flower initiation has not been well described, and the reported requirement for a diurnal temperature fluctuation to elicit flowering is unclear. Two Phalaenopsis clones were grown in glass greenhouse compartments with constant temperature set points of 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, or 29 degrees C and fluctuating day/night (12 h/12 h) temperatures of 20/14, 23/17, 26/14, 26/20, 29/17, or 29/23 degrees C.

The number of inflorescences per plant and the number of flower buds on the first inflorescence were greatest when the average daily temperature was 14 degrees C or 17 degrees C. These results indicate that a day/night fluctuation in temperature is not required for inflorescence initiation in these two Phalaenopsis clones. Furthermore, the inhibition of flowering when the day temperature was 29 degrees C and the night temperature was 17 degrees C or 23 degrees C suggests that a warm day temperature inhibits flower initiation in Phalaenopsis.",,,,,,"Runkle, Erik/0000-0003-0398-4183",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0957,1460-2431,,,,DEC,2006,57,15,,,,,4043,4049,,10.1093/jxb/erl176,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erl176,,,,,,,,17075080,,,,,WOS:000242716100008,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we analyse the two processes determining the chronology of leaf development-initiation of leaf primordia by the shoot meristem and production of expanded leaves out of the shoot tip-in several pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivars in response to air temperature and plant growth rate. Contrasting levels of air temperature and plant growth rate during leaf development were induced by a,wide range of sowing dates and plant densities in glasshouse or field experiments. Full leaf expansion was found to occur one phyllochron after full leaf unfolding, whatever the leaf nodal position. Primordium initiation and expanded-leaf production rates presented similar quantitative responses to air temperature (linear response and common x-intercept), whatever the plant growth rate, cultivar or period of cycle. As a consequence, they were co-ordinated and the numbers of initiated primordia or expanded leaves were easily deduced from simple visual observation of leaf unfolding. The change, over time, of the numbers of initiated leaf primordia and fully expanded leaves correlated with cumulated degree-days, with stable relationships in a wide range of environmental conditions. Two phases, with different production rates. had to be considered. These results allowed us to predict accurately the beginning and the end of individual leaf development from daily mean air temperatures. The relationships obtained were provide an effective way of analysing and predicting leaf development responses to the environment.

Collecting all these measurements together and producing global maps of SST has been a difficult endeavor due in part to different data formats, data location and accessibility, and lack of measurement error estimates. The need for a uniform approach to SST measurements and estimation of measurement errors resulted in the formation of the international Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) High Resolution SST Pilot Project (GHRSST-PP). Projects were developed in Japan, Europe, and Australia. Simultaneously, in the United States, the Multi-sensor Improved SST (MISST) project was initiated. Five years later, the MISST project has produced satellite SST data from nine satellites in an identical format with ancillary information and estimates of measurement error. Use of these data in global SST analyses has been improved through research into modeling of the ocean surface skin layer and upper ocean diurnal heaing.

This study has got air flow characteristics in block-stone layer for the first time by high-precision micro wind-speed detector. The results indicate that the convection process is closely related to the temperature change; the rapid cooling is completed in accelerating and stable stage, thereafter slowly cooling process; when the temperature difference in crushed-rock layer is higher than the start temperature difference, the correlation between natural convective velocity and temperature difference is linear. With the cooling process the convective characteristics is different in the same condition of temperature difference. The influence of surface temperature fluctuations on the bottom temperature along the depth direction weakened; and there is a linear correlation between retardancy of temperature and depth. The asymmetry of temperature change is caused by different heat transfer ways and heat transfer efficiencies. At the same time, there is the scope of heat conduction in block-stone layer, in order to ensuring the cooling effect thickness of block-stone layer must be greater than the scope of heat conduction.

Among different bacterial agents, Streptococcus agalactiae is a major problem, causing heavy loss in cultured and wild fish species from fresh and marine water. Outbreaks with considerable mortalities in different fish species have been associated with multiple environmental factors, including warm water temperatures, increased ammonia levels and low dissolved oxygen levels. The effects of various water quality factors on streptococcal infections have been previously shown. To date, there is no available data on the effects of water temperature on the infection of rainbow trout with S. agalactiae. Therefore, present study evaluated the effect of two water temperatures (12 and 18 degrees C) on clinical signs, relative percent survival (RPS), cumulative mortality and LD50 in rainbow trout against S. agalactiae. Materials, Methods & Results: Three hundred and sixty rainbow trout (56 +/- 4.1 g) were acclimatized for 2 weeks and fed the commercial fish diet at 2% body weight twice daily. The experiment was conducted in two different water temperatures (12 +/- 1 degrees C and 18 +/- 1 degrees C). In each temperature, fish were injected with 0.2 mL of five different concentrations (10(8), 10(7), 10(6), 10(5) and 10(4) CFU mL(-1)) of S. agalactiae (RTCC2051). In control group, the same amount of physiological saline was injected instead of the bacterial suspension. Mortality rates and clinical signs were recorded for 14 days. Throughout the experiment, different signs such as eye abnormalities, erratic swimming and body lesions were observed in fish which were exposed to high bacterial doses at 18 degrees C while fish kept at 12 degrees C were completely asymptomatic. No mortality was observed within 2 or 3 days in fish at 12 degrees C while at 18 degrees C, the mortality started growing rapidly even from first day of bacterial injections. Results also revealed that the trend of mortalities in 18 degrees C was quite different from 12 degrees C. The median lethal dose (LD50) on the 14th day was also calculated at 12 and 18 degrees C as 7.22 x 10(7) CFU mL(-1) and 1.711 x 10(7) CFU mL(-1), respectively. Discussion: In this study, the relationship between temperature and infection with Streptococcus agalactiae was pronounced. When the water temperature was 18 degrees C, mortality due to S. agalactiae was higher in rainbow trout than 12 degrees C. It was previously showed that the optimum temperature for growth provide the best performance of fish immune system. Non-specific and specific immune parameters in teleost decrease significantly when the water temperature is lower or higher than normal physiological range of the fish. According to current study, the higher mortality in fish kept at 18 degrees C might be affected by the reduction of rainbow trout immunogenic activity. On the other hand, the effects of water temperature on the progress of infection in fish species are also important. For example, manipulation of temperature and/or salinity can be used to reduce the growth rate of Flavobacterium psychrophilum. The change of virulent S. agalactiae related to water temperature in fish species needs more consideration. In conclusion, there was a clear relationship between temperature and mortality in rainbow trout against Streptococcus agalactiae and the total cumulative mortality at 18 degrees C was higher compared to 12 degrees C for every single concentration used.",,,,,,"Mirvaghefi, Alireza/0000-0002-5954-7997; Sepahi, Ali/0000-0001-7270-024X; Sheikhzadeh, Najmeh/0000-0002-0909-7270; Heidarieh, Marzieh/0000-0003-2097-960X",,,,,,,,,,,,,1678-0345,,,,,JAN 3,2013,41,,,,,,,,1097,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000320936200003,View Full Record in Web of Science

XX. Body temperatures and physical activity of female mice during lactation,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lactating animals consume greater amounts of food than non-reproductive animals, but energy intake appears to be limited in late lactation. The heat dissipation limit theory suggests that the food intake of lactating mice is limited by the capacity of the mother to dissipate heat. Lactating mice should therefore have high body temperatures (T-b), and changes in energy intake during lactation should be reflected by variation in T-b. To investigate these predictions, 26 mice (Mus musculus) were monitored daily throughout lactation for food intake, body mass, litter size and litter mass. After weaning, 21. days postpartum, maternal food intake and body mass were monitored for another 10. days. Maternal activity and T-b were recorded every minute for 23. h a day using implanted transmitters (vital view). Energy intake increased to a plateau in late lactation (days 13-17). Daily gain in pup mass declined during this same period, suggesting a limit on maternal energy intake. Litter size and litter mass were positively related to maternal energy intake and body mass. Activity levels were constantly low, and mice with the largest increase in energy intake at peak lactation had the lowest activity. T-b rose sharply after parturition and the circadian rhythm became compressed within a small range. T-b during the light period increased considerably (1.1 degrees C higher than in baseline), and lactating mice faced chronic hyperthermia, despite their activity levels in lactation being approximately halved. Average T-b increased in relation to energy intake as lactation progressed, but there was no relationship between litter size or litter mass and the mean T-b at peak lactation. These data are consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory, which suggests performance in late lactation is constrained by the ability to dissipate body heat.",,,,,"Speakman, John R./A-9494-2008","Speakman, John R./0000-0002-2457-1823; Vaanholt, Lobke M./0000-0002-5102-7970",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,,,,,OCT,2013,216,19,,,,,3751,3761,,10.1242/jeb.090308,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.090308,,,,,,,,23788704,,,,,WOS:000324233500029,View Full Record in Web of Science

Increasing summer temperatures in salmonid growing regions worldwide are presenting new challenges for effective nutrient delivery, particularly as feeds increasingly replace fish oil with cheaper and available energy sources. The effect of temperature and non-protein energy sources on growth performance, nutrient utilisation and digestibility of brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis was evaluated at temperatures reflective of optimum, 15 degrees C, and elevated summer conditions, 19 degrees C. The experiment was a 2 x 4 factorial design with two temperatures (15 degrees C and 19 degrees C) and four iso-nitrogenous (protein: 440 g/kg) and iso-energetic (22 MJ/kg) diets. Diets were formulated with increasing carbohydrate level (180-260 g/kg) balanced by decreasing lipid level (170-130 g/kg). A 12-week study was conducted using triplicate group of brook trout with initial weight 48.0 +/- 3.46 g at each temperature. Fish were fed 2% body weight ration daily. Growth rate was higher and feed utilisation was more efficient at 15 degrees C than 19 degrees C (P=0.00). Reduced fish oil inclusion and increased gelatinised carbohydrate had no effect on growth and feed utilisation at both temperatures. The apparent digestibility coefficients of nutrient and energy were significantly higher at 15 degrees C than 19 degrees C (P=0.00). Dry matter, gross energy and energy from carbohydrate were more digestible as dietary carbohydrate levels increased, at both temperatures. Increasing dietary carbohydrate generated an increase in the intestinal activity of alpha-amylase, which was higher at 15 degrees C. Across the levels of dietary carbohydrate tested; there were no pathological changes to liver or intestine histology. Fish oil can be substituted with gelatinised carbohydrate under challenging high water temperatures in brook trout feeds, with no detriment to health, nutrient digestibility or growth performance.

These measurements were made with the four-pulse experiment by the middle and upper atmosphere (MU) radar in Japan over the period August 1986 to April 1990. The neutral temperature and density results are compared with MSIS-86 model predictions. We divide our data into low and high solar activity levels, four seasons, and 24 one-hour times bins. While the seasonal and solar activity behavior of the ionospheric density, and of the anticorrelation of the electron temperature with this density, shows many aspects in common with those at other locations, a few particular differences are evident. At low solar activity the height of the F layer varies from 240 km during the day to 320 km at night, regardless of season. At high solar activity the maximum density of the F layer varies little with season. These facts seem to indicate little seasonal change in F region neutral atmospheric composition at this geographic location. At solar maximum the F layer is established at a higher altitude than at low solar activity, and the summer F layer in particular is formed at such a high altitude that its decay at night is very slow, its diurnal variation is hence weak, and the density remains so high at sunrise that little sunrise effect in the electron temperature is produced. The neutral temperatures in the F region have the same basic diurnal pattern as does the MSIS-1986 model temperatures, but the radar temperatures are consistently lower by an amount ranging up to 160 K for summer conditions at high solar activity.

NIR spectra of peanut-soy-corn oil mixtures measured at seven temperatures were analyzed. It was found that, the relationship between TSVC and normalized squared temperature can be established by using LSS. Furthermore, the quantitative determination of the compositions in a mixture can be achieved by using the difference between the relationships, i.e., the slope of the relationship. The calibration curves between slope and composition volume are found to be reliable with the correlation coefficients (R-2) as high as 0.9992.

Temperature distributions were measured on two stations: in the ground under car park and in the ground covered with short grass. Based on the known analytical solution of one-dimensional transient temperature distributions in semi-infinite solid and using results of ground temperature monitoring the new semi-empirical equations for temperature distributions were developed. The width of the uncertainty band of temperature distributions for 95% confidence for the ground under grass cover was narrower and only about 60% of the value for the bare ground surface due to the dumping effect of the vegetation. The measurements reveal that the daily ground temperature fluctuations are discernible at the depth of about x = 0.35 m during strong sun irradiation in summer and about x = 0.1 m during short and scarce periods in winter. The comparison of the ground temperature distributions e.g. at the depth of about x = 1.5 m indicates that the ground covered with grass is more suitable to be used as the heat or cold source for horizontal ground heat exchangers for heat pumps and for air conditioning systems.

To fill this gap, this paper presents an experimental evaluation of the reliability of LoRa in the presence of temperature variations. First, we highlight that temperature can have a significant impact on LoRa's communication performance and show that an increase in temperature can be sufficient to transform a perfect LoRa link into an almost useless one. We then carry out a detailed investigation on the performance of different LoRa physical settings with fluctuating temperatures and show that an optimal selection can help in increasing the probability of packet reception and is hence key to mitigate temperature-induced effects. We believe that our results will serve as a reference to orient researchers and system designers employing LoRa to build large-scale low-power wide area networks.",,,,,"Römer, Kay/C-8802-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-989-758-284-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,39,50,,10.5220/0006605600390050,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0006605600390050,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000570980200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

To develop an evaluation method for thermal fatigue, the authors previously performed a mixing tee experiment called the T-Cubic experiment. In this study, a fluid-structure coupled simulation for conjugate heat transfer was carried out to investigate the predictive performance of the flow and temperature fields and temperature fluctuation on the pipe inner surface at a mixing tee of the T-Cubic experiment. The computational domain included 304 type stainless steel pipe as well as the working fluid of water. Time-averaged velocity and temperature were reproduced well over the entire computational domain. Although velocity fluctuation intensity at a distance from the wall was relatively smaller than experimental data, the simulation could reproduce the trend of the experimental data, especially the velocity fluctuation intensity peak near the wall. The temperature fluctuation intensity was also larger than the experimental data, though the tendency could be reproduced by the simulation. The temperature fluctuation intensity on the pipe inner surface is the most important parameter for thermal fatigue and though it was 20% to 36% larger than the experimental data at its peak, the tendency was reproduced to a certain extent.

This information provides a base for the new management concept of precision livestock farming. From 2003 to 2006, time series of herd mean daily milk yield were collected on 6 experimental research farms in the Netherlands. These time series were analyzed with an adaptive dynamic model following a Bayesian method to quantify the effect of heat stress. The effect of heat stress was quantified in terms of critical temperature above which heat stress occurred, duration of heat stress periods, and resulting loss in milk yield. In addition, dynamic changes in level and trend were monitored, including the estimation of a weekly pattern. Monitoring comprised detection of potential outliers and other deteriorations. The adaptive dynamic model fitted the data well; the root mean squared error of the forecasts ranged from 0.55 to 0.99 kg of milk/d. The percentages of potential outliers and signals for deteriorations ranged from 5.5 to 9.7%. The Bayesian procedure for time series analysis and monitoring provided a useful tool for process control. Online estimates (based on past and present only) and retrospective estimates (determined afterward from all data) of level and trend in daily milk yield showed an almost yearly cycle that was in agreement with the calving pattern: most cows calved in winter and early spring versus summer and autumn. Estimated weekly patterns in terms of weekday effects could be related to specific management actions, such as change of pasture during grazing. For the effect of heat stress, the mean estimated critical temperature above which heat stress was expected was 17.8 +/- 0.56 degrees C. The estimated duration of the heat stress periods was 5.5 +/- 1.03 d, and the estimated loss was 31.4 +/- 12.2 kg of milk/cow per year. Farm-specific estimates are helpful to identify management factors like grazing, housing and feeding, that affect the impact of heat stress.

Growing the same varieties under these altered climatic conditions often requires mitigation strategies, but quantitative, generalized understanding of the impacts of such strategies can be difficult or time consuming to determine through field trials. This work developed and validated a detailed three-dimensional (3D) model of grape berry temperature that could fully resolve spatial and temporal heterogeneity in berry temperature, and ultimately predict the impacts of potential high berry temperature mitigation strategies such as the use of alternative trellis systems. A novel experimental data set was generated in which the temperature of exposed grape berry clusters was measured with thermocouples at four field sites with different trellis systems, topography, and climate. Experimental measurements indicated that the temperature of shaded berries closely followed the ambient air temperature, but intermittent periods of direct solar radiation could generate berry temperatures in excess of 10 degrees C above ambient. Validation results indicated that by accurately representing the 3D vine structure, the model was able to closely replicate rapid spatial and temporal fluctuations in berry temperature. Including berry heat storage in the model reduced the errors by dampening extreme temporal swings in berry temperature.",,,,,"Ponce de León, María Alejandra/AHB-7623-2022","Ponce de León, María Alejandra/0000-0002-4675-1673",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1923,1873-2240,,,,AUG 15,2021,306,,,,,,,,108431,10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108431,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108431,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000659137200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Richardson (1922, Weather Prediction by Numerical Process, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, p. 236) wrote his famous book. NWP has primarily been successul in improving day-by-day forecasts starting from an observed detailed Initial Condition (IC) out to about a week. The purpose of this paper is to discuss first the state of the art in long-range NWP by presenting results of a new large numerical experiment (named DERF90; from Dynamical Extended Range Forecasting in 1990 out to 90 days) conducted at the National Meteorological Center (NMC) during the summer and autumn of 1990 (Section 2). One hundred and twenty eight 90-day global forecasts were made from successive daily initial conditions (IC), thus giving us ample opportunity to assess skill of forecasts at lead times beyond 1 week. We then move on to define the notion of a limit of predictability (LOP), and following a procedure by Lorenz (1982), give a numerical estimate of the LOP using the DERF90 data set. We then produce a list of reasons, as to why this estimate (LOP = 18 days) should not be taken too literally. In particular, we argue that the LOP varies as a function of the flow itself, and it would be (much) larger if we had, as we will ultimately, a coupled ocean-atmosphere model for making long-lead forecasts. Last, but not least, we present results of empirical forecasts that point to modest but significant skill well beyond the traditional LOP (a few weeks). A specific recent example of empirical forecasting is discussed. Through Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), experimental forecasts are being made for the United States surface temperatures at lead times of several seasons. While modest, the skill is significant in that it defies the existence or a 3-week LOP, and so demonstrates the potential for model improvements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0377-0265,,,,,MAR,1994,20,3,,,,,247,270,,10.1016/0377-0265(94)90020-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0377-0265(94)90020-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1994NA57000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

With increasing patch temperature, it is found that the mean open rates of sodium and potassium channels of the HH neuron are decreased, and the mean duration of spikes of membrane potential is also decreased, which are qualitatively consistent with previous experimental results of single ion channel. Under moderate patch size, the mean interspike interval of membrane potential first decreases, reaches a minimum, and then increases with increasing patch temperature. It is shown that for both low and high temperatures, the channels fluctuation-induced spontaneous action potentials appear to be rather irregular, while for moderate patch temperature, relatively coherent oscillations observed. By defining a measure parameter, we show that there is a maximal region for the measure P in the patch temperature and patch size parameter plane where the coherence resonance phenomena are very remarkable, and the characteristic correlation time of the output also confirm our result.

This study investigates the application of soil-moisture nudging using a single-column version of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model. The model was applied at 16 sites selected to sample a range of climates and land covers across the globe, with atmospheric forcing taken from the ECMWF operational analysis for 15 June 1994 and 15 December 1994. When observation errors are set to zero, the Optimal Interpolation technique for deriving estimates of nudging coefficients shows computational instability because strong correlation between near-surface temperature and near-surface relative humidity forecast errors makes the coefficient matrix of the Linear equations ill-posed. Therefore, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used as a pre-processor to identify the independent and dependent components of temperature and relative humidity errors. With PCA, the soil-moisture nudging coefficients appropriate to the dominant principal component become stable and effective for correcting soil moisture within days. Such coefficients, when derived for the northern hemisphere summer over the 16 sites, are sufficiently consistent to propose using their all-site, daily-average values in a globally applicable soil-moisture analysis scheme. Tests of this method at the First ISLSCP (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Program) Field Experiment (FIFE) site confirm that soil-moisture nudging can provide good estimates of near-surface weather variables and surface fluxes in a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model which gives poor simulation of precipitation (thereby poor soil moisture). However, the PCA method is unable to give an accurate determination of the location of the soil moisture within soil layers that are accessible to the atmosphere. Further, these tests show that, if the NWP model has good simulation of precipitation but poor simulation of surface radiation, soil-moisture nudging could wrongly vary the soil moisture so as to provide good estimates of the surface sensible-heat flux, but poor estimates of surface latent-heat flux. An approach to distinguish error sources from surface radiation and soil moisture is necessary for further improvement.",,,,,"Gupta, Hoshin V/CAG-5323-2022; Viterbo, Pedro/B-7184-2008; Gupta, Hoshin V/D-1642-2010","Gupta, Hoshin V/0000-0001-9855-2839; Viterbo, Pedro/0000-0001-6587-3062; Gupta, Hoshin V/0000-0001-9855-2839",,,,,,,,,,,,,0035-9009,,,,,JUL,1999,125,557,A,,,,1879,1902,,10.1002/qj.49712555719,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.49712555719,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000081688500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal of this study was to investigate the stability of body temperature in large fish using data from field experiments. We measured the muscle temperatures of free-ranging whale sharks (Rhincodon typus), the largest extant fish globally, and investigated their ectothermic physiology and the stability of their body temperature. The muscle temperature changed substantially more slowly than the water temperature fluctuations associated with vertical movements, and the whole-body heat-transfer coefficients (HTCs) of whale sharks estimated using heat-budget models were lower than those of any other fish species measured to date. The heat-budget models also showed that internal heat production does not contribute to changes in muscle temperature. A comparative analysis showed that the HTC at cooling in various fish species including both ectothermic and endothermic species ranging from 10(-4) to 10(3) kg was proportional to body mass(-0.63). This allometry was present regardless of whether the fish were ectothermic or endothermic, and was an extension of the relationship observed in previous studies on small fish. Thus, large fish have the advantage of body temperature stability while moving in environments with large temperature variations. Our results suggest that the large body size of whale sharks aids in preventing a decrease in body temperature during deep excursions to more than 1000 m depths without high metabolic costs of producing heat.",,,,,,"Nakamura, Itsumi/0000-0002-1386-7266",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUN,2020,223,11,,,,,,,jeb210286,10.1242/jeb.210286,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.210286,,,,,,,,34005620,,,,,WOS:000541848100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Changes in tree stem circumference include both irreversible woody stem growth and reversible circumference changes related to water status, yet these fine-scale dynamics are rarely leveraged to understand forest ecophysiology and typically ignored in plot-or stand-scale estimates of tree growth and forest productivity. Here, we deployed automated dendrometer bands on 12-40 trees at four different forested sites-two temperate broadleaf deciduous, one temperate conifer, and one tropical broadleaf semi-deciduous-to understand how tree circumference varies on time scales of hours to months, how these dynamics relate to environmental conditions, and whether the structure of these variations might introduce substantive error into estimates of woody growth. Diurnal stem circumference dynamics measured over the bark commonly-but not consistently-exhibited daytime shrinkage attributable to transpiration-driven changes in stem water storage. The amplitude of this shrinkage was significantly correlated with climatic variables (daily temperature range, vapor pressure deficit, and radiation), sap flow and evapo-transpiration. Diurnal variations were typically <0.5 mm circumference in amplitude and unlikely to be of concern to most studies of tree growth. Over time scales of multiple days, the bands captured circumference increases in response to rain events, likely driven by combinations of increased stem water storage and bark hydration. Particularly at the tropical site, these rain responses could be quite substantial, ranging up to 1.5 mm circumference expansion within 48 hours following a rain event. We conclude that over-bark measurements of stem circumference change sometimes correlate with but have limited potential for directly estimating daily transpiration, but that they can be valuable on time scales of days to weeks for characterizing changes in stem growth and hydration.",,,,,"Chang-Yang, Chia-Hao/I-9273-2019; Lutz, James/AAA-9574-2019; Anderson-Teixeira, Kristina J./U-6075-2019; Herrmann, Valentine/AAY-4643-2021","Chang-Yang, Chia-Hao/0000-0003-3635-4946; Herrmann, Valentine/0000-0002-4519-481X; Lutz, James/0000-0002-2560-0710; Teixeira, Kristina/0000-0001-8461-9713",,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,DEC 28,2016,11,12,,,,,,,e0169020,10.1371/journal.pone.0169020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169020,,,,,,,,28030646,,,,,WOS:000391222000100,View Full Record in Web of Science

The peak stress, peak strain and elastic modulus with the same impact velocity fluctuate in different extents with the increase of temperature before 400 degrees C. When temperature is above 400 degrees C, the peak stress, peak strain and elastic modulus increase or decline nearly linearly with the increase of temperature. There is remarkable difference among dynamic failure modes of marble under different temperatures. Especially, when temperature reaches 1000 degrees C, the fragments are powder and uniform particles.

Radiation thermometry is the main method for non-contact temperature measurement. The second measurement(SM) method is one of the common methods in the multispectral radiation thermometry. However, the SM method cannot be applied to on-line data processing. To solve the problems, a rapid inversion method for multispectral radiation true temperature measurement is proposed and constraint conditions of emissivity model are introduced based on the multispectral brightness temperature model. For non-blackbody, it can be drawn that emis-sivity is an increasing function in the interval if the brightness temperature is an increasing function or a constant function in a range and emissivity satisfies an inequality of emissivity and wavelength in that interval if the brightness temperature is a decreasing function in a range, according to the relationship of brightness temperatures at different wavelengths. The construction of emissivity assumption values is reduced from multiclass to one class and avoiding the unnecessary emissivity construction with emissivity model constraint conditions on the basis of brightness temperature information. Simulation experiments and comparisons for two different temperature points are carried out based on five measured targets with five representative variation trends of real emissivity: decreasing monotonically, increasing monotonically, first decreasing with wavelength and then increasing, first increasing and then decreasing and fluctuating with wavelength randomly. The simulation results show that compared with the SM method, for the same target under the same initial temperature and emissivity search range, the processing speed of the proposed algorithm is increased by 19. 16%similar to 43. 45% with the same precision and the same calculation results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-0593,,,,,OCT,2015,35,10,,,,,2675,2679,,10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)10-2675-05,http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2015)10-2675-05,,,,,,,,26904798,,,,,WOS:000362241400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two new factors, the temperature variance (T-var(2)) and local overheating index (LOH index), were proposed to assess the temperature fluctuation and distribution. Results showed that the heat generation rate was higher on the cathode side than that on the anode side due to the different resistivity of current collectors.

The electron thermal diffusivities are calculated using the diffusive space-time evolution characteristic of the electron temperature perturbations produced by internal sawtooth collapse. It is found that the electron thermal diffusivity significantly increases as ECRH is turned on. The temperature fluctuations in the ECRH-assisted ohmic plasmas measured by the correlation electron cyclotron emission (CECE) diagnostic have a larger amplitude and broader bandwidth than that of pure ohmic plasmas. However, there is a slight change in the density fluctuations. The electron thermal diffusivities and the bandwidth of the electron temperature fluctuations decrease simultaneously as density increases in ohmic plasmas. However, the same trend is not found for ECRH-assisted ohmic plasmas with fixed ECRH power. The electron thermal diffusivities increase almost linearly with the ECRH power for the same discharge parameters, while the temperature fluctuations become broader at the same time. Linear stability analysis using the gyrokinetic electromagnetic numerical experiment code indicates that there is a turbulence transition from the mixed mode of ion temperature gradient mode and trapped electron mode (TEM) to the pure (broader) TEM when changing from pure ohmic to ECRH-assisted ohmic plasmas. It is consistent with the temperature fluctuations measured by CECE, which is sensitive to the long-wavelength modes. All these results suggest that the long-wavelength temperature fluctuations play an important role in electron thermal transport. In ECRH-assisted ohmic plasmas, electron thermal transport may become dominated by ETGs when TEMs are suppressed at high density.",,,,,,"Gao, Li/0000-0001-5758-3516; Yang, Zhoujun/0000-0002-9141-7869",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-5515,1741-4326,,,,AUG,2021,61,8,,,,,,,86005,10.1088/1741-4326/ac04f4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1741-4326/ac04f4,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000668330700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An understanding of how organisms with different life history strategies will respond to such changes is an integral part of biodiversity conservation. Corticosterone (CORT) levels are often used as metrics to assess the population health of wild vertebrates, despite the fact that the stress response and its effects on organismal function are highly variable. Our understanding of the stress response is primarily derived from studies on endotherms, leading to some contention on the effects of chronic stress across and within taxa. We assessed the behavioral and hormonal responses to experimentally elevated stress hormone levels in a free-ranging, arid-adapted ectotherm, the Southern Pacific rattlesnake (Crotalus helleri). Plasma CORT was significantly elevated in CORT-implanted snakes 15 days after implantation. Implantation with CORT did not affect testosterone (T) levels or defensive behavior. Interestingly, we observed increased defensive behavior in snakes with more stable daily body temperatures and in snakes with higher plasma T during handling (tubing). Regardless of treatment group, those individuals with lower baseline CORT levels and higher body temperatures tended to exhibit greater increases in CORT levels following a standardized stressor. These results suggest that CORT may not mediate physiological and behavioral trait expression in arid-adapted ectotherms such as rattlesnakes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This experiment was part of a sustainable water management project in West Africa. The Granier system was used to measure half-hourly whole-tree sap flow. Weather variables were observed with an automatic weather station, whereas soil moisture and tension were measured with a Delta-T profile probe and tensiometers respectively. Clearness index (CI), a measure of the sky condition, was significantly correlated with tree transpiration (r(2) = 0.73) and potential evaporation (r(2) = 0.86). Both diurnal and daily stomata conductance were poorly correlated with the climatic variables. Estimated daily canopy conductance g(c) ranged from 4.0 to 21.2 mm s(-1), with a mean value of 8.0 +/- 3.3 mm s(-1). Water flux variation was related to a range of environmental variables: soil water content, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit. Linear and non-linear regression models, as well as a modified Priestley-Taylor formula, were fitted with transpiration, and the well-correlated variables, using half-hourly measurements. Measured and predicted transpiration using these regression models were in good agreement, with r(2) ranging from 0.71 to 0.84. The computed measure of accuracy delta indicated that a non-linear model is better than its corresponding linear one. Furthermore, solar radiation, CI, clouds and rain were found to influence tree water flux.

We manipulated autochthonous resources by adding inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus to two lakes during three summers and monitored a third reference lake. Allochthonous resources were measured as fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM). In the reference and two experimental lakes, daily estimates of respiration were made from continuously deployed oxygen sensors. Daily mean values of temperature and FDOM were determined from high-frequency measurements along with daily measures of chlorophyll a, an index of phytoplankton biomass. We analyzed time series of respiration and tested models that used combinations of the independent variables chlorophyll, FDOM, and temperature. The best models included all three of the independent variables. Respiration increased twofold over the temperature range of 14.5-28.6 degrees C. Respiration increased in association with phytoplankton blooms caused by the nutrient additions, but did not track blooms closely, because of large day-to-day variability. Respiration varied positively with FDOM that was primarily allochthonous and differed among lakes and years. We did not detect an interaction between chlorophyll and FDOM despite the large number of observations and range of chlorophyll and FDOM.

Yet, the role of such variability in determining specific maximum temperature thresholds of cnidarian holobionts (the ecological units comprised of cnidarian hosts and associated microorganisms, including Symbiodiniaceae) remains untested. Here we contrasted the thermal resilience (that is the ability to resist stress) of a model symbiotic cnidarian from the Red Sea (jellyfish of the genus Cassiopea) under stable and diel oscillating temperature conditions that provide night-time reprieves from daily maximum temperatures. Holobionts were subjected to two thermal trajectories; one that increased but plateaued at 2 degrees C below identified bleaching thresholds and another that increased incrementally until holobionts bleached. We used behavior, growth, photochemical efficiency, Symbiodiniaceae (symbiont) cell density, and total chlorophyll cell content to characterize thermal resilience and examined Symbiodiniaceae community composition responses at 1 and 13 days of exposure, and post-bleaching. Lower night-time temperatures, resulting in lower daily mean temperatures, allowed holobionts to withstand daily maximum temperatures close to their bleaching thresholds for two extra days than those under stable maximum temperature conditions. Lower night-time temperatures increased the bleaching threshold of the holobionts, whereby holobionts exposed to night-time thermal reprieves tolerated a more extreme daily mean temperature of 40.6 degrees C and reached a daily thermal maxima 4 degrees C higher than those under stable temperature conditions. However, post-bleaching observations indicate that night-time temperature reprieves did not prevent symbiont cell or pigment loss. Symbiodiniaceae communities were unaffected by lower night-time temperatures and no directional changes indicative of symbiont shuffling/ selection of thermally tolerant lineages were observed.

Incubating parent birds are adapted to keep their eggs within a temperature range appropriate for embryo development, but king rail clutches are at risk of exceeding lethal temperatures in the latter half of the nesting season. We investigated whether behavioral plasticity during incubation enables parents to maintain clutch temperature within tolerable limits for embryo development. Video revealed that king rail parents interrupted incubation to stand above and shade their eggs. We tested the hypothesis that the onset of shading was a direct response to ambient temperature (adaptive plasticity). We monitored clutch temperature directly by experimentally adding into clutches a model egg embedded with a programmable iButton. We measured ambient temperature at the nest site simultaneously. Parents spent proportionately more time shading and less time incubating their eggs at higher ambient temperatures. Shading may primarily function in cooling the parent. The frequency and duration of shading bouts were significantly greater at higher ambient temperatures. Parents also took more frequent but shorter recesses in hotter conditions. Diurnal recesses exposed eggs to direct sunlight, and the highest clutch temperatures were recorded under these conditions. Complete hatching failure in at least one nest was attributable to high clutch temperature for an extended period. Because mean ambient temperature increases throughout the breeding season, we investigated seasonal patterns in onset of incubation and its effect on hatching rate. Later in the season, parents tended to initiate incubation earlier, and hatching asynchrony increased significantly. Together these results suggest that breeding king rails may be constrained in their ability to cope with sustained high temperatures should seasonal averages continue to rise as predicted.",,,,,"McRae, Susan/L-7273-2019","McRae, Susan/0000-0003-3209-4710",,,,,,,,,,,,,0908-8857,1600-048X,,,,APR,2017,48,4,,,,,479,488,,10.1111/jav.01056,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.01056,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000403146600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has recently been suggested that these steps could provide important insights into the mechanism of polymer crystallization. In particular, a characterization of the profiles of these steps might reveal the fixed-point attractor that underlies a recently proposed crystallization mechanism. Here we examine this hypothesis by performing simulations of such temperature jumps using the Sadler-Gilmer model. We find that for this model the step profiles do reveal the fixed-point attractor. However, for temperature decreases they also reflect the rounding of the crystal edge that occurs in this model and for temperature increases they also reflect the fluctuations in the thickness present in the crystal. We discuss the implications of these results for the interpretation of experimental step profiles. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In mammals, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a major regulator of cellular [ATP] and activates ATP-producing pathways, while inhibiting ATP-consuming pathways. We hypothesized that temperature stress in marine invertebrates activates AMPK to provide adequate concentrations of ATP at increased but sublethal temperatures and that AMPK consequently can serve as a stress indicator (similar to heat shock proteins, HSPs). We tested these hypotheses through two experiments with the rock crab, Cancer irroratus. First, crabs were exposed to a progressive temperature increase (6 degrees C h(-1)) from 12 to 30 degrees C. AMPK activity, total AMPK protein and HSP70 levels, reaction time, heart rate and lactate accumulation were measured in hearts at 2 degrees C increments. AMPK activity remained constant between 12 and 18 degrees C, but increased up to 9.1(+/- 1.5)-fold between 18 and 30 degrees C. The crabs' reaction time also decreased above 18 degrees C. By contrast, HSP70 (total and inducible) and total AMPK protein expression levels did not vary significantly over this temperature range. Second, crabs were exposed for up to 6 h to the sublethal temperature of 26 degrees C. This prolonged exposure led to a constant elevation of AMPK activity and levels of HSP70 mRNA. AMPK mRNA continuously increased, indicating an additional response in gene expression. We conclude that AMPK is an earlier indicator of temperature stress in rock crabs than HSP70, especially during the initial response to high temperatures. We discuss the temperature-dependent increase in AMPK activity in the context of Shelford's law of tolerance. Specifically, we describe AMPK activity as a cellular marker that indicates a thermal threshold, called the pejus temperature, T-p. At T-p the animals leave their optimum range and enter a temperature range with a limited aerobic scope for exercise. This T-p is reached periodically during annual temperature fluctuations and has higher biological significance than earlier described critical temperatures, at which the animals switch to anaerobic metabolism and HSP expression is induced.",,,,,"Furey, Nathan/J-4862-2012","Furey, Nathan/0000-0002-8584-7889",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,MAR 1,2009,212,5,,,,,722,730,,10.1242/jeb.021998,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.021998,,,,,,,,19218524,,,,,WOS:000263433600025,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the measurement precision of NIR spectroscopy is adversely affected by the change in external conditions. Among these influence factors, temperature fluctuation is harder to be controlled than other conditions such as contact pressure and measurement position. Based on the displacement effect between solvent and solute molecules in solution, a reference wavelength method for temperature measurement of solution is presented in the present paper. The theoretical expression of the method was introduced. The experiment was designed to measure the spectra of glucose aqueous solution under different temperatures, and the effect of eliminating the temperature disturbance was evaluated. When the temperature and solute concentration of solution change simultaneously, the absorbency difference value at reference-wavelength is insensitive to solute concentration, and is totally affected by temperature fluctuation. Therefore, according to the absorbance difference, the actual temperature of the sample can be calculated. The regression model of temperature measurement was established, and the solution temperature was calculated based on this model. The information about temperature can be acquired exactly by reference-wavelength method, and the experimental results showed that the average error of calculated temperature is 0.03 degrees C.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-0593,,,,,OCT,2009,29,10,,,,,2657,2660,,10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2009)10-2657-04,http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2009)10-2657-04,,,,,,,,20038031,,,,,WOS:000270346100017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The emissions of CH4 and N2O and the soil's redox potential (E-h) were measured weekly for two crop cycles. Daily variation in CH4 emission rates was measured with and without rice straw incorporation in planted and unplanted soil (with no warming treatments) during four growth stages of the crop. Methane emissions increased by as much as 91% with increasing amounts of water and soil temperature (+2 and +4 degrees C), up to 34-35 degrees C. Increases in temperature (+2 and +4 degrees C above ambient) above 34-35 degrees C decreased emissions by 30-36%. A decrease in soil E-h to <-100mV and in CH4 emissions was observed earlier in the pots containing rice straw than in those without straw. Methane emissions varied daily; they were larger from 11:00 to 14:00hours, particularly in unplanted soil. They showed positive correlations with the temperatures of both soil and air. In contrast, N2O emissions were negligible throughout the growing season.

After describing the common experimental protocol and detailing each model configuration, a gridded temperature data set is derived from observations and used to show that all the models have a warm bias over parts of the Midwest. Additionally, a strong diurnal cycle in the screen temperature bias is found in most models. In some models the bias is largest around midday, while in others it is largest during the night. At the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains (SGP) site, the model biases are shown to extend several kilometers into the atmosphere. Finally, to provide context for the companion papers, in which observations from the SGP site are used to evaluate the different processes contributing to errors there, it is shown that there are numerous locations across the Midwest where the diurnal cycle of the error is highly correlated with the diurnal cycle of the error at SGP.

These effects are caused by secondary structure differences that can occur between the amplified sample and the internal standard. The type of method chosen to generate the sizing curve in STR analysis can influence the relationship between estimated allele size and temperature. To better understand the effects of temperature and sizing method on the reproducibility of DNA migration, two fluorescently labeled allelic ladders, CTTv and Y-PLEX 6 were analyzed using the ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. The default method on the Genetic Analyzer utilizes an electrophoretic temperature of 60 degreesC and a Local Southern method to generate a sizing curve from the fragment migration times of the internal lane standard. In this work, electrophoresis was conducted at 35-70 degreesC using the commercially available POP 4 buffer at pH 8 and two sizing methods, Global Southern and Local Southern, were compared. The slopes of the regression line between estimated allele size and temperature, using either sizing method, were measured in order to demonstrate the temperature sensitivity of migration time and the importance of the operator-chosen method. Our results indicate that the Global Southern method is a better choice in situations where temperature fluctuations can occur. In addition, the temperature dependence of the DNA size estimates using the POP 4 system were compared to results obtained using an experimental buffer consisting of 3% hydroxyethyleellulose at pH 11. These results demonstrate that secondary structure effects are minimized at an elevated pH, increasing the precision of size estimates obtained. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

These paradigms together have been largely applied to macro invertebrates and vertebrates but rarely to microorganisms. According to these paradigms, foliar fungal pathogens are expected to respond directly to the fluctuations in leaf temperature, rather than in air temperature. We determined experimentally the impact of two patterns of leaf temperature variation of equal mean temperature, but differing in their daily amplitude, on the development of Zymoseptoria tritici, a fungus infecting wheat leaves. The highest daily thermal amplitude resulted in two detrimental effects for the pathogen fitness: an increase in the length of the latent period, i.e. the 'generation time' of the fungus when infecting its host plant, and a decrease in the density of fruiting bodies on the leaves. We discussed these empirical results, mainly the impact of both the daily thermal amplitude and the fluctuation frequency on the pathogen development in planta, in the light of the mathematical effect of the integration of non-linear functions.

Large species-specific differences in UV sensitivity were observed for all parameters: the lower subtidal species C. truncatus and P. rubens were highly sensitive to the UV treatments, whereas P. palmata. which predominantly occurs in the upper subtidal zone, was not affected by these treatments, Only minor differences were found between Arctic and temperate isolates, suggesting that no differences in UV sensitivity have evolved in these species. Relative growth rates were temperature-dependent. whereas species-specific UV effects on growth rates were relatively independent of temperature. In contrast. the species-specific decrease in F-v/F-m and its subsequent recovery were temperature-dependent in all species. UV effects on F-v/F-m were lower at 12 and 18 degreesC compared with 6 degreesC. In addition, UV effects on F-v/F-m decreased in the course of the experiment at all temperatures, indicating acclimation to the UV treatments. CPDs accumulated during the experiment in both isolates of P. rubens, whereas CPD concentrations remained low for the other two species. CPD accumulation appeared to be independent of temperature. The results suggest that summer temperatures occurring in temperate regions facilitate repair of UV-induced damage and acclimation to UV radiation in these algae compared with Arctic temperatures.

Wheat plants of cultivar Chinese Spring were grown at various temperature regimes at several stages of reproductive development for different durations. The objectives of this research were to (i) identify the stage(s) most sensitive to HT stress during reproductive development, and (ii) determine threshold temperature and duration of HT stress that decrease floret fertility and individual grain weight. Two periods (first at 8-6 days before anthesis and second at 2-0 days before anthesis) during reproductive development were most sensitive to short episodes (2 or 5 days) of HT stress, causing maximum decreases in floret fertility. Short episodes (5 days) of mean daily temperatures >24 degrees C imposed at start of heading quadratically decreased floret fertility, with the values reaching close to 0% around mean daily temperature of 35 degrees C; and floret fertility and individual grain weight decreased linearly with increasing duration (in the range from 2 to 30 days) of HT stress when imposed at start of heading or start of grain filling respectively. HT stress caused morphological abnormalities in pollen, stigma and style. The combination of lower floret fertility (leading to decreased grain numbers) and decreased individual grain weights can cause significant decreases in grain yield. Further research to search for genetic variability for these traits and use them in breeding programs to develop tolerant genotypes that can provide yield stability under current and future climates is warranted.",,,,,"Prasad, P.V.

Temperature distribution in the plume is of great interest for analyzing the compatibility of rocket weapon system. The high temperature exhausted flow field would cause damage on certain equipment and loading vehicles. An instantaneous temperature field with sharp step is established by the exhausted flow field of rocket motor. The increasing rate of the step depends on the flow velocity at cross section of nozzle exit. To perform an accurate measurement of temperature inside the flow field, a thermocouple must be sturdy enough to endure the flow impingement. In the meantime, the thermocouple must have a short time constant to trace the temperature fluctuation in flow field and a small size to avoid disturbing the flow field severely. The dynamic performance of the thermocouples used in exhausted flow temperature measurement must be evaluated before the experiment. The thermocouple which can be used in measuring the temperature distribution in rocket plume was presented in this paper. A NAMNAC (R) self-renew-erode thermocouples with a nominal time constant of 10 microseconds was used as a reference in a dynamic calibration test for this kind of thermocouple. The thermocouple could trace the temperature increase in the exhausted flow perfectly. This kind of thermocouples was used in several real tests of rocket motors, such as the temperature in free exhausted flow field of a stationary rocket motor test, the stagnate temperature in a shock flow field during the launching of a rocket, and the temperature in a launch tube.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0277-786X,,0-8194-6278-0,,,,2006,6222,,,,,,Q2220,Q2220,62220Q,10.1117/12.659993,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.659993,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000239302800025,View Full Record in Web of Science

The requirement for microstructural control and reliability have become all the more important as coatings have now become part of an integrated prime reliant design strategy aimed at increasing turbine inlet temperature and associated efficiencies. One of the important thrusts in monitoring and controlling the process has been the application of process sensors that measure spray stream characteristics, notably particle temperature and velocity. Although single particle-based measurements have been available for some time, in general control strategies based on particle state rely on average values of temperature and velocity. In this study, a detailed examination of particle temperature distributions is presented. When systematically examined over a wide range of operating conditions of the resulting range of particle temperatures, a significant structure in the statistical distribution has been observed. A close inspection of the data indicates that this distribution can be interpreted as melting state indicator for YSZ. A characteristic peak at the melting point of ZrO2 (error in absolute T-measurement is approximate to +/- 10%) can be used as an indicator for re-solidified particles. In the past, control strategies based on process diagnostic sensors have been based on average particle temperatures and velocities. Although the average values seem to be promising as control parameters, it has been shown through our results that different melting states could be demonstrated for the same average T and V settings. The melting state in turn has an important bearing on the coating structure and properties. It therefore implies that a process control strategy (to maintain coating quality) based on in flight particle sensors will have to take these findings into account. As an example, one strategy of process control would not only define the process in terms of the average particle temperature and velocity but also include the effect that parameter changes have on distributions.",,,,,,"Sampath, Sanjay/0000-0002-9804-4647",,,,,,,,,,,,,0272-4324,1572-8986,,,,FEB,2006,26,1,,,,,73,102,,10.1007/s11090-005-8727-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11090-005-8727-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000234752700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Proposed causative mechanisms include the radiative impact of atmospheric aerosols on the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) where the temperature response is amplified due to shallow depth and its sensitivity to potential destabilization. A 1-D version of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System is used to examine the sensitivity of the nocturnal boundary layer temperature to the surface longwave radiative forcing (SLWRF) from urban aerosol loading and doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The analysis is conducted for typical midlatitude nocturnal boundary layer case days from the CASES-99 field experiment and is further extended to urban sites in Pune and New Delhi, India. For the cases studied, locally, the nocturnal SLWRF from urban atmospheric aerosols (2.7-47 W m(-2)) is comparable or exceeds that caused by doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide (3 W m(-2)), with the surface temperature response ranging from a compensation for daytime cooling to an increase in the nocturnal minimum temperature. The sensitivity of the NBL to radiative forcing is approximately 4 times higher compared to the daytime boundary layer. Nighttime warming or cooling may occur depending on the nature of diurnal variations in aerosol optical depth. Soil moisture also modulates the magnitude of SLWRF, decreasing from 3 to 1 W m(-2) when soil saturation increases from 37% to 70%.

The interest in such a topic has been triggered by the recent observation of negative temperatures in condensed matter experiments. Moreover, the ability to manipulate systems at the micro and nano-scale urges to understand and clarify some aspects related to the statistical properties of small systems (as the issue of temperature's fluctuations). We also discuss the notion of temperature in a dynamical context, within the theory of linear response for Hamiltonian systems at equilibrium and stochastic models with detailed balance, and the generalized fluctuation response relations, which provide a hint for an extension of the definition of temperature in far from-equilibrium systems.

Concentrations of N-min (NH4+-N and NO3--N) were measured after 0-1-2-4-7-10 weeks for the sandy soil and the sandy soil:rye shoot mixture, and after 0-2-7-10 weeks for the sandy soil:rye root mixture.

Maximum mineralisation occurred at 15 degrees C; after ten weeks, it was 39% of total applied organic nitrogen from shoot and 35% from root material. The time course of mineralisation was calculated using an exponential decay function.

A simulation model was developed in which decomposition, mineralisation and nitrification were modelled as one step processes, following first order kinetics. The relative decomposition rate was influenced by soil temperature and soil moisture content, and the mineralisation of N was calculated from the decomposition of C, the C to N ratio of the catch crop material and the C to N ratio of the microbial biomass. The model was validated first with the results of the experiment.

The original analyses and reanalyses produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are compared with the reanalyses produced by the National Meteorological Center (NMC) system, operational in early 1987. Daily values of vorticity zeta, divergence delta, temperature T, static stability GAMMA, mixing ratio q, vertical motion omega, and diagnosed diabatic heating rate are compared for the period of 26 January-11 February 1979. The spatial mean and variance, temporal mean and variance, two-dimensional wavenumber power spectrum, anomaly correlation, and normalized square difference are used for comparison. Also, equivalent blackbody temperatures from the TIROS-N are used as a proxy to the vertical motion and diagnosed diabatic heating rates in the tropics. Data are interpolated onto the sigma-coordinates of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM1) with 12 vertical levels. Global data are expanded in spherical harmonics with two resolutions [triangular 13 (T13) and T42] in order to investigate how data agreement changes depending on the horizontal length scale. Other questions to be investigated are: What aspects of the analyses have improved in the FGGE reanalyses produced at the ECMWF and NMC? What aspects of the analyses are still unsatisfactory? What can be done to further improve the analyses? Since data agreement tends to be weak in the tropics, attention is focused in the tropical belt of 30-degrees-N-30-degrees-S. One enlightening finding is that both zeta and delta of the NMC reanalyses agree more closely with the ECMWF reanalyses than their earlier analyses. This result may indicate that both the data quality and the analysis techniques have improved. More good news is found in that the agreement of zeta at T13 is excellent, while there is only slight disagreement at T42, indicating that FGGE has succeeded in describing the quasi-rotational state of the atmosphere, even in the tropics. The bad news is that interanalysis agreement of delta and q is poor.

Few studies have examined whether ectotherms acclimate to diurnal temperature fluctuations, or how natural and domesticated populations differ in their responses to diurnal fluctuations. We examine how diurnally fluctuating temperatures during development affect growth, acclimation, and stress responses for two populations of Manduca sexta: a field population that typically experiences wide variation in mean and fluctuations in temperature, and a laboratory population that has been domesticated in nearly constant temperatures for more than 300 generations. Laboratory experiments showed that diurnal fluctuations throughout larval development reduced pupal mass for the laboratory but not the field population. The differing effects of diurnal fluctuations were greatest at higher mean temperature (30 degrees C): Here diurnal fluctuations reduced pupal mass and increased pupal development time for the laboratory population, but had little effect for the field population. We also evaluated how mean and fluctuations in temperature during early larval development affected growth rate during the final larval instar as a function of test temperature. At an intermediate (25 degrees C) mean temperature, both the laboratory and field population showed a positive acclimation response to diurnal fluctuations, in which subsequent growth rate was significantly higher at most test temperatures. In contrast at higher mean temperature (30 degrees C), diurnal fluctuations significantly reduced subsequent growth rate at most test temperatures for the laboratory population, but not for the field population. These results suggest that during domestication in constant temperatures, the laboratory population has lost the capacity to tolerate or acclimate to high and fluctuating temperatures. Population differences in acclimation capacity in response to temperature fluctuations have not been previously demonstrated, but they may be important for understanding the evolution of reaction norms and performance curves.",,,,,,"Moore, M.

The model was based on two energy balance equations: for the ground and for the vegetation, and considered the water layer and changes in the aerodynamic properties of its surface with water depth. The model was examined with field experiments for water depths of 0 mm (drained conditions) and 100 mm (flooded condition) at two locations. Daily mean water temperatures in the flooded condition were mostly higher than in the drained condition in both locations, and the maximum difference reached 2.6 degrees C. This difference was mainly caused by the difference in surface roughness of the ground. Heat exchange by free convection played an important role in determining water temperature. From the model simulation, the temperature difference between drained and flooded conditions was more apparent under low air temperature and small leaf area index conditions; the maximum difference reached 38 degrees. Most of this difference occurred when the range of water depth was lower than 50 mm. The season-long variation in modeled water temperature showed good agreement with an observation data set from rice paddies with various rice-growing seasons, for a diverse range of water depths (root mean square error of 0.8-1.0 degrees C).

For this purpose, pressure fluctuations of a fluidized bed of sand particle were measured at various gas velocities and temperatures. Recurrence quantification analysis showed that by increasing the temperature up to 300 degrees C, both determinism and laminarity increase due to formation of larger bubbles whereas entropy and recurrence rate decrease. To better detecting the different structures of in the bed recurrence plot at higher temperature, pressure fluctuations were also decomposed through wavelet transform. It was shown that at low gas velocity, the macro structures became dominate with increasing the bed temperature due to increase in the rate of bubble coalescence. The bubble diameter was estimated from the incoherent component of the cross power spectra of pressure signals at various temperatures and velocities. The incoherent results and standard deviation of measured pressure fluctuations confirmed that by increasing the bed temperature up to 300 degrees C, bubbles grow up to a maximum diameter, after which they became smaller. In addition, the trend of the largest positive Lyapunov exponent was estimated through the recurrence plot patterns. It was shown that a bubbling fluidized bed is a chaotic system at higher temperatures.

We measured temperatures beneath plates of exfoliating bark of six species of dead trees used for roosting by long-legged myotis (Myotis volans) from June to July 2003-2006 in Idaho and Oregon, USA, and compared these across tree species and with ambient temperature (T-A). Temperature profiles beneath bark oscillated within the range of T-A, demonstrating the ability of bark cavities on dead trees to insulate against daily extremes in maximum and minimum T-A. Slope position affected the difference in bark cavity temperature from T-A during daytime periods, with bark cavities on dead trees in upper slope positions being cooler than T-A compared to bark cavities on dead trees in lower slope positions. Differences in bark cavity temperatures from T-A varied among dead tree species during nighttime periods, with white fir (Abies concolor) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) warmer than T-A compared to other dead tree species. Mean daily maximum temperatures beneath bark of dead white fir, grand fir (Abies grandis), western white pine (Pinus monticola), and ponderosa pine met or exceeded the theoretical lower critical temperature (T-LC) of long-legged myotis (range = 29.7-30.5 degrees C) within several hours of sunset, but were substantially colder for much of the day.

The effects of PCM filling and its filling amount on thermal response of brick wall are investigated and discussed. It is indicated that, compared to the common solid brick wall, the thermal storage of brick wall filled with PCM is elevated by the alternate process of melting and solidification under fluctuating outdoor temperatures. The use of PCM in the brick walls is beneficial for the thermal insulation, temperature hysteresis and thermal comfort for occupancy. In addition, with the increasing filling amount of PCM, the fluctuation of indoor wall surface temperature is significantly smoothed.

Both model simulations and measurements show a strong temperature stratification in the water during daytime. Throughout the night, however, a well-mixed layer starting at the water surface develops. Because the water body is relatively small, it appears that the sediment heat flux has a strong effect on the behaviour of the water temperature throughout the seasons. In spring, the water temperature remains relatively low due to the cold surrounding soil, while in autumn the opposite occurs due to the relatively warm soil.

We found that temperature regimes could have a large and pervasive effect on the transcriptome evolution, with as much as 38% of the genes being differentially expressed between selection regimes. Although evolved lineages showed different changes of gene expression based on ancestral genotypes, we identified a set of genes responding specifically to fluctuation. We found that transcriptome evolution in fluctuating conditions was repeatable between parallel lineages initiated from the same genotype for about 60% of the differentially expressed genes. Further, we detected several hotspots of significantly differentially expressed genes in the genome, in regions known to be enriched in repetitive elements, including accessory chromosomes.

The effect of temperature on the rate and duration of grain fill was further assessed in two cultivars. Fundulea and Caldwell, over 4 yr.

Duration of grain fill in the 175 entries averaged 28 +/- 0.9 d. Heading occurred on 17 different dates, anthesis on 13 different dates and grain maturity on 17 different dates. The average daily temperature (ADT) during grain fill ranged between 21.2 and 22.5-degrees-C.

The superior thermal conductivity of the thermal silica plate combined with the excellent cooling effect of water led to a feasible and effective composite liquid cooling system during long cycle testing. The experimental results showed that the addition of thermal silica plates can greatly improve the cooling capacity that can allow the maximum temperature difference to be controlled at 6.1 degrees C and reduce the maximum temperature of the battery module by 11.3 degrees C, but still outside the optimum operating temperature range. The water flow significantly enhanced the cooling performance/stability, and slight temperature fluctuations were observed during cycling. The cooling performance obviously improved as the flow rate rose. When the velocity reached a critical value, further increase in water flow rate induced a slight influence on the cooling capacity due to the limitation of the materials.

Dissolved oxygen sensors and pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry were used for the measurements of photosynthetic efficiency. A Diving-PAM revealed that underwater measurements of the effective quantum yield (Phi(PSII)) of both species declined with increasing incident PAR, with minimum Phi(PSII) occurring during noon to early afternoon. Phi(PSII) recovered in the evening, indicating photo-adaptation to excessive PAR. In laboratory experiments, Phi(PSII) also decreased under continuous exposure to 1000 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1); and full recovery occurred after 12 h of dark acclimatization. The net photosynthesis - PAR experiments of S. mcclurei and S. oligocystum conducted at 28 degrees C revealed that the net photosynthetic rate quickly increased at PAR below the saturation irradiance of 361 and 301 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and nearly saturated to maximum net photosynthetic rates of 385 and 292 mu g O-2 g(ww)(-1) min(-1) without photoinhibition, respectively. Gross photosynthesis and dark respiration experiments determined over a range of temperatures (12-40 degrees C), revealed that the maximum gross photosynthetic rates of 201 and 147 mu g O-2 g(ww) (-1) min(-1) occurred at 32.9 and 30.7 degrees C for S. mcclurei and S. oligocystum, respectively. The dark respiration rates increased exponentially over the temperature ranges examined. The estimated maximum value of the maximum quantum yield occurred at 19.3 and 20.0 degrees C and was 0.76 and 0.74, respectively.

The results show that: coal is composed by different functional groups; coal functional groups contents are susceptible to the influence of sample quantity, tab letting process and so on. At the low-temperature oxidation stage, oxygenic functional groups change obviously and hydroxyl can especially reflect the spontaneous combustion hazard of coal. Infrared absorption peak area of hydroxyl decreased to the lowest about 80 degrees C then increased with temperature rise, and low metamorphic grade coal declines obviously in the early stage. The variation trends of hydroxyl proportion in the changing temperature for three coal samples are the same, i.e. the fluctuating and overall downward trend; at a certain temperature (between 40 degrees C and 180 degrees C), and hydroxyl proportion is higher for coal samples with higher oxygen contents. Since there is little variation for aromatics(C=C) at the low-temperature oxidation stage, the ratio of aromatics and hydroxyl that can reflect hydroxyl variation shows the fluctuating variation trend which is consistent for the three coal samples. Peaks of the ratio of C=C and OH appear in 60-80 degrees C 120-150 degrees C, illustrating that the total generation of hydroxyl is the minimum at these three points, and the ratio is relatively lower for high oxygen content coal ple,and higher for high metamorphic coal sample.

Cardamine hirsuta L. (Brassicaceae) shows variation in lateral stamen number, that is, zero to two lateral stamens. The aim of this study was to examine whether temperature conditions alter stamen number. Temporal changes in the frequency of flowers with zero, one, and two lateral stamens were assessed during the flowering periods of a natural population and a garden-transplanted population in Japan. We conducted an experiment to evaluate how temperature regimes during flowering (15 degrees/15 degrees C and 15 degrees/5 degrees C) alter the number of stamens. The proportion of flowers with zero lateral stamens increased in both the natural and the garden-transplanted population as the flowering season progressed. In the growth experiment, lateral stamen numbers fluctuated even within individual inflorescences, but the frequency of flowers with zero lateral stamens was higher in the high-temperature condition than in the low-temperature condition. Temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity is likely to be the cause of the field-observed variation in lateral stamen number for C. hirsuta.

These data suggest early animals experienced frequent hypoxia. Research has thus focused on the concentration of molecular oxygen (O-2) required by early animals, while also considering the impacts of climate. One model, the Cold Cradle hypothesis, proposed the Ediacaran biota originated in cold, shallow-water environments owing to increased O-2 solubility. First, we demonstrate using principles of gas exchange that temperature does have a critical role in governing the bioavailability of O-2-but in cooler water the supply of O-2 is actually lower. Second, the fossil record suggests the Ediacara biota initially occur approximately 571 Ma in deep-water facies, before appearing in shelf environments approximately 555 Ma. We propose an ecophysiological underpinning for this pattern. By combining oceanographic data with new respirometry experiments we show that in the shallow mixed layer where seasonal temperatures fluctuate widely, thermal and partial pressure (pO(2)) effects are highly synergistic. The result is that temperature change away from species-specific optima impairs tolerance to low pO(2). We hypothesize that deep and particularly stenothermal (narrow temperature range) environments in the Ediacaran ocean were a physiological refuge from the synergistic effects of temperature and low pO(2).",,,,,,"Elder, Leanne/0000-0001-5244-9780; Stockey, Richard/0000-0001-5541-7987",,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,DEC,2018,285,1893,,,,,,,20181724,10.1098/rspb.2018.1724,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.1724,,,,,,,,30963899,,,,,WOS:000456873600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study evaluated the effects of temperature on development and yield of maize cultivars differing in both adaptation and selection history. Experiments were sown in seven tropical environments where the mean temperature during the growing season varied from 13 degrees C to 28 degrees C. Cultivars adapted to tropical highland, tropical midaltitude, tropical lowland and temperate environments were included. Among these were comparisons of cycles 0 and 6 (C-0, C-6) of three populations, which had been improved through international progeny trials grown at several sites within specific adaptation zones. An additional cultivar, CIMMYT's Large del Dia, was represented as 100 full-sib progenies, and grown in an adjacent trial in each environment. This cultivar was formed by selecting within a broadly-based composite for yield across adaptation zones, and for photoperiod insensitivity. Measures of development included rates of emergence and leaf appearance, and times to anthesis and silking. Final leaf number, grain yield, and yield components were also measured. In two of the three comparisons, C-6 selections significantly outyielded their C-0 equivalents across environments. No differences between C-0 and C-6 were observed in yield stability, as measured by standard deviation of yield across environments, or in developmental patterns. Principal components and cluster analyses revealed that Large del Dia differed from other cultivars in emergence rate, leaf appearance rate, and anthesis date. Across environments its mean grain yield was generally similar to that of the temperate cultivar, and had the smallest standard deviation. The range of grain yields among full-sib progenies of Large del Dia was similar to that observed among cultivars of different adaptation groups. Selection within a broad-based population for adaptation to diverse environments resulted in a cultivar with a unique response of development to temperature, more stable grain yield over a wide range of temperatures, but with less specific adaptation to any single environment. While the temperate maize cultivar also exhibited stable yields across environments, tropical cultivars were more specific in their adaptation. Results indicate that it may not be possible to select a cultivar with high and stable grain yield across temperatures ranging from 13 degrees C to 28 degrees C, because cool- and warm-temperature adaptation may be mutually exclusive traits. Broad adaptation is possible across a more moderate range of temperatures, however and can be improved by selection.

At the lower and upper thermal limits (< 11-degrees-C and > 33-degrees-C) of the species, survival of larvae under fluctuating temperatures was greater than recorded in previously published studies under equivalent constant temperatures. A serious constraint on fitting a model to the later larval instars was the inconsistent appearance of a seventh instar.

This requirement is particularly true for air-cooled cycles where compressor inlet density is a strong function of inlet temperature that is subject to daily and seasonal variations as well as transient events. In order to meet these requirements, a novel centrifugal compressor stage design was developed that incorporates multiple novel range extension features, including a passive recirculating casing treatment and semi-open impeller design. This design, presented and analyzed for CO2 operation in a previous paper, was fabricated via direct metal laser sintering and tested in an open-loop test rig in order to validate simulation results and the effectiveness of the casing treatment configuration. Predicted performance curves in air and CO2 conditions are compared, resulting in a reduced diffuser width requirement for the air test in order to match design velocities and demonstrate the casing treatment. Test results show that the casing treatment performance generally matched CFD predictions, demonstrating an operating range of 69% and efficiency above air predictions across the entire map. The casing treatment configuration demonstrated improvements over the solid wall configuration in stage performance and flow characteristics at low flows, resulting in an effective 14% increase in operating range with a 0.5-point efficiency penalty.

In a laboratory experiment, we grew a natural phytoplankton community under fluctuating and constant temperature regimes across 25 combinations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply. Temperature fluctuations decreased phytoplankton growth rate (r(max)), as predicted by nonlinear averaging along the temperature-growth relationship. r(max) increased with increasing P supply, and a significant temperature x P x N interaction reflected that the shape of the thermal reaction norm depended on nutrients. By contrast, phytoplankton carrying capacity increased with N supply and in fluctuating rather than constant temperature.

The incident Gaussian beam was transformed into concentric multi-circular beam of specific intensity distribution with the help of diffractive optical element (DOE), and the transient temperature fields in the piston similar to those under working conditions could be achieved by setting up appropriate loading cycles. Simulation tests for typical thermal loading conditions, i.e., thermal high cycle fatigue (HCF) and thermal shock (or thermal low cycle fatigue, LCF) were carried out. Several important parameters that affect the transient temperature fields and/or temperature oscillations, including controlling mode, intensity distribution of shaped laser, laser power, temporal profile of laser pulse, heating time and cooling time in one thermal cycle, etc., were investigated and discussed.

Several experimental studies have been performed over different surfaces (pine forest, maize, bare soil) using TIR cameras, either ground based or helicopter borne, designed to evaluate (i) how the spatial resolution operates a smoothing of the temporal fluctuations of the surface temperature measurements from space, and (ii) the resulting uncertainty on these measurements. Additionally, a simulation of instantaneous surface temperatures of a maritime pine stand, performed using a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) airflow model coupled with a canopy model, is presented for comparison. The results confirm that the impact of the SBL turbulence rapidly vanishes when spatial resolution decreases (i.e., pixel size increases) in the range of 50 to 100 m, while T-s fluctuations induced by the low frequency PBL turbulence remain. For these resolutions, the resulting uncertainty on T-s lies within a +/- 1 degrees C interval.

The results showed that anammox activity initially decreased in the three reactors, but that activity levels and nitrogen loading rate (NLR) increased as the bacteria gradually adapted to the new conditions (12-30 days). Temperature and concentration shift affected anammox activity jointly. In the process, the abundance of mRNA of the key functional genes of hdh and nirS, changed with time but this change did not reflect the change of anammox activity. When the reactors reached a stable state after 40 d, the effect of temperature fluctuations was tested. The results showed that anammox adapted to low temperatures as soon as temperature decreased (i.e., decreased from 35 degrees C to 15 degrees C). When temperature increased, 2-3 days were needed for activity recovery. From this result, it may be concluded that reactors with low temperatures and low substrate (mainstream) concentrations can be started up using anammox cultivated at a higher temperature (35 degrees C) with low substrate. Then anammox in Ra was used to start up a mainstream reactor at 15 degrees C and it was operated for 60 days. The results showed that the activity in Ra decreased sharply to the level as that of Rc at the stable state. After the experiment, microbiological analysis showed that the anammox was stable and that Candidatus Kuenenia was the dominant species. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This requirement is particularly true for air-cooled cycles where compressor inlet density is a strong function of inlet temperature that is subject to daily and seasonal variations as well as transient events. In order to meet these requirements, a novel centrifugal compressor stage design was developed that incorporates multiple novel range extension features, including a passive recirculating casing treatment and semi-open impeller design. This design, presented and analyzed for CO2 operation in a previous paper, was fabricated via direct metal laser sintering and tested in an open-loop test rig in order to validate simulation results and the effectiveness of the casing treatment configuration. Predicted performance curves in air and CO2 conditions are compared, resulting in a reduced diffuser width requirement for the air test in order to match design velocities and demonstrate the casing treatment. Test results show that the casing treatment performance generally matched computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predictions, demonstrating an operating range of 69% and efficiency above air predictions across the entire map. The casing treatment configuration demonstrated improvements over the solid wall configuration in stage performance and flow characteristics at low flows, resulting in an effective 14% increase in operating range with a 0.5-point efficiency penalty.

These artefacts can erroneously be interpreted as an aerosol gradient or, in extreme cases, as a cloud base leading to false cloud detection. A correct specification of the overlap function is hence crucial in the use of automatic elastic lidars (ceilometers) for the detection of the planetary boundary layer or of low cloud. In this study, an algorithm is presented to correct such artefacts. It is based on the assumption of a homogeneous boundary layer and a correct specification of the overlap function down to a minimum range, which must be situated within the boundary layer. The strength of the algorithm lies in a sophisticated quality-check scheme which allows the reliable identification of favourable atmospheric conditions. The algorithm was applied to 2 years of data from a CHM15k ceilometer from the company Lufft. Backscatter signals corrected for background, range and overlap were compared using the overlap function provided by the manufacturer and the one corrected with the presented algorithm. Differences between corrected and uncorrected signals reached up to 45aEuro-% in the first 300aEuro-m above ground. The amplitude of the correction turned out to be temperature dependent and was larger for higher temperatures. A linear model of the correction as a function of the instrument's internal temperature was derived from the experimental data. Case studies and a statistical analysis of the strongest gradient derived from corrected signals reveal that the temperature model is capable of a high-quality correction of overlap artefacts, in particular those due to diurnal variations. The presented correction method has the potential to significantly improve the detection of the boundary layer with gradient-based methods because it removes false candidates and hence simplifies the attribution of the detected gradients to the planetary boundary layer. A particularly significant benefit can be expected for the detection of shallow stable layers typical of night-time situations. The algorithm is completely automatic and does not require any on-site intervention but requires the definition of an adequate instrument-specific configuration. It is therefore suited for use in large ceilometer networks.",,,,,,"Haefele, Alexander/0000-0002-3912-5316",,,,,,,,,,,,,1867-1381,1867-8548,,,,,2016,9,7,,,,,2947,2959,,10.5194/amt-9-2947-2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/amt-9-2947-2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000379417200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Though several researchers have studied the influence of temperature on thermophysical properties, the scope of the temperature is usually below 100 degrees C, and the relationship between thermophysical properties and mass loss caused by high temperature has not been investigated in detail. In this paper, the effect of high temperatures (up to 800 degrees C) upon the thermophysical properties of clay is investigated and the relationship between thermal parameters and mass loss is researched via laboratory test. The test results indicate that thermal conductivity and specific heat decrease exponentially as temperatures rise, and thermal diffusivity that fluctuates between 0.3 mm(2)/s and 1.2 mm(2)/s exhibits a certain degree of volatility with temperature. When the temperature rises, the water dissipates, the clay splits, and the organics carbonize and sublimate. All of these physical chemical changes make the water content decrease and porosity increase, eventually altering the thermal parameters of clay. Furthermore, thermal conductivity displays a good linearity with mass loss and a negative exponent with porosity. The results obtained in this paper will be good for predicting the thermophysical properties of clay when exposed to high temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of temperature and acclimation on locomotion performance of the moth was also investigated. Temperature and duration of exposure significantly affected survival of both adults and larvae of P. insulata with more extreme temperatures and/or longer durations proving to be more lethal. Third instar larvae and adults are both freeze intolerant and had LT50 of -5.9 and -4.7 degrees C, respectively, after a 2 h exposure. Although cold acclimation was beneficial to the nocturnal larvae, temperatures below 10 degrees C significantly reduce their locomotion activities. The average daily minimum temperatures in the coldest months at three locations in South Africa are over 5 degrees C lower than those of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, where P. insulata was originally collected. Our results suggest that lethal high or low temperatures at short timescales are trivial in explaining the variable performance of P. insulata, but reduced locomotion at sub-lethal temperatures may be an important driver of the population dynamics of the biocontrol agent (especially in winter months) and may consequently explain the low population levels of the moth because of possible reduced feeding by larvae during night-time low temperatures.",,,,,"Uyi, Osariyekemwen/AAQ-5353-2020; Hill, Martin/G-9423-2017","Uyi, Osariyekemwen/0000-0001-5268-4676; Hill, Martin/0000-0003-0579-5298",,,,,,,,,,,,,0007-4853,1475-2670,,,,AUG,2017,107,4,,,,,448,457,,10.1017/S0007485316001103,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485316001103,,,,,,,,27974070,,,,,WOS:000405628200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

At morning, midday and evening, leaves were submitted to different irradiance levels by differentially shading them. Both species emitted large amounts of monoterpenes (about 20 mu g g DM-1 h(-1)). The most emitted terpene by P. halepensis was Delta(3)-carene followed by beta-myrcene, alpha-pinene and beta-pinene. The most emitted terpene by Q. ilex was limonene followed by a-pinene and P-pinene. No clear correlation to temperature was found for Q. ilex emission within the diurnal range of 21-33 degrees C, whereas P. halepensis emissions increased with the temperature. There was no consistent link between terpene emissions and PFD or photosynthetic rates for P. halepensis but there were significant relationships for Q. ilex. However, emissions by Q. ilex became inhibited at highest PFDs and during the course of the day when net photosynthesis decreased under summer drought. The study shows that the emission rates of both species are highly variable and that during a hot Mediterranean summer day (with limited water availability) the diurnal variation of emission is not only driven by the common light and temperature dependencies. Water stress, branch-to-branch variability and other influences must explain great part of the observed variability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Sensors for measuring gas temperatures must be selected according to many different criteria, response time being one of the most important. Response time quantifies the time that the sensor needs to react to a sudden temperature variation. When rapid temperature fluctuations are expected, as in the case of fire tests, significant instantaneous errors can occur if the sensor response time is longer than the duration of the temperature fluctuation. Despite the importance of response time, there is no general agreement on how to quantify this value in high temperature fiber optic sensors. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate the response time of fiber optic temperature sensors based on an analytical model of the heat transfer between the sensor and its surroundings. The method is validated by an experimental study. In addition, the response times of three different high temperature fiber optic sensors developed by the authors are compared with each other and with the response time of some widely used thermocouples. The results show (i) that fiber optic sensors have a significantly shorter response time than thermocouples with similar packaging, (ii) that the response time is shorter during the heating phase than the cooling phase, and (iii) highlight the importance of considering this parameter in the sensor selection process.

It was established that the meteorological regime of the glacier is characterized by a relatively high mean daily temperatures, humidity and cloudiness, while mean wind speed is relatively low. Liquid precipitation dominates over the solid one and condensation over evaporation.

The food, equivalent to 3% daily of the animal dry weight was supplied continuously by a peristaltic pump. The rates of different physiological processes were measured on 18 scallops (three replicates per temperature/diet combination) during the third week of conditioning. Nine scallops came from the group conditioned at 16 degrees C and other nine from the group conditioned at 20 degrees C (each scallop from a different tank). As in the conditioning experiment, physiological measurements were made in controlled temperature rooms using the same experimental diets. Argopecten purpuratus did not show significant differences in clearance rate between 16 and 20 degrees C when fed with pure microalgae and microalgae + lipids, showing a well known capability of bivalves to acclimate their physiological rates within a certain range of temperature. On the other hand a clear effect of the composition of the diet on the clearance rate was observed. When microalgae were supplemented with a lipid emulsion, clearance rate was highly stimulated, showing values significantly higher in comparison with either pure microalgae, or a mixed diet of microalgae + carbohydrate. These highest feeding rates can be related with the presence of essential fatty acids in the diet, which are considered as very important compounds during the gametogenesis of invertebrates as well as during the development of ova into normal larvae. Thus A. purpuratus can actively regulate clearance rate and does not simply switch between feeding and non-feeding states. The data also suggest the presence of chemical receptors at the level of the gills and/or labial palps, which seem able to detect specific nutritive compounds present in the diet. Absorption efficiency was independent of temperature and was higher with pure microalgae and with microalgae + lipids. The lowest efficiencies were recorded with the diet supplemented with carbohydrates. The energy expended in oxygen uptake and ammonia excretion was very similar in the different experimental diets and temperatures. Scope for growth in A. purpuratus appears mainly affected by the diet and not by temperature. While the lower SFG seems to be associated with diets composed of pure microalgae and microalgae + carbohydrates, the highest values being found for a diet rich in lipids. The data were in agreement with the reproductive conditioning of A. purpuratus, where the highest percentage of ripe scallops occurred in individuals fed with a diet of microalgae supplemented with lipids at both temperatures. Similarly the highest larval survival rate was obtained from gametes released by scallops conditioned with the diet containing lipids. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

We tested this hypothesis experimentally with a sister species pair of non-biting midges (Chironomus riparius and C. piger) by assessing their relative larval fitness under several concentrations of nitrite and temperature regimes, as suggested by the observed habitat segregation in a previous field study. Both chironomid species often occur in eutrophic habitats like agricultural areas or industrial point source effluents. Based on field observations, we hypothesised C. piger to tolerate higher nitrite concentrations, higher temperatures and larger temperature ranges than C. riparius. As predicted, C. piger coped better with higher nitrite concentrations. Against the expectations, C. riparius had a tendentially higher fitness at both higher constant temperatures and larger daily temperature ranges. However, the interaction of both stressors favoured C. piger in warm high-nitrite habitats thus concurring to the field observations.

Despite the studies already developed in this field, more research is needed to assess the possibility of its integration in buildings avoiding user intervention. In this study, the influence of air vent management and materials' heat storage capacity upon its thermal performance, particularly in the temperature fluctuation and indoor conditions, was discussed. Comparing two days with similar solar radiation (SR) for non-ventilated (NVTW) and ventilated (VTW) Trombe walls, a differential of 43 degrees C between the external surface temperature and the one in the middle of the massive wall was verified for NVTW, while for VTW this value was 27 degrees C, reflecting the heat transfer by air convection, which reduced greenhouse effect, solar absorption and heat storage. A cooling capacity greater than 50% was verified for VTW compared to NVTW during night periods. An algorithm for the Trombe wall's automation and control was proposed considering SR as variable. Air vents and external shading devices should be open when SR exceeds 100 W/m(2) and closed for 50 W/m(2) to obtain at least 20 degrees C inside the room.

J,"Zhou, YZ; Li, X",,,,"Zhou, Yanzhao; Li, Xin",,,Energy balance closures in diverse ecosystems of an endorheic river basin,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"The surface energy imbalance or non-closure problem, where the sum of turbulent heat fluxes measured by the eddy covariance method is systematically lower than the available energy, is one of the greatest challenges in micrometeorology. We examine the energy balance closure ratio (EBR) and its relationship with related variables over a wide variety of ecosystems including alpine meadow, desert, shrub, and crops in the Heihe River Basin (HRB), China, which is representative of endorheic river basins. The results show that half-hour EBR values over different ecosystems range from 0.53 to 0.99, with a mean of 0.84. In different HRB ecosystems, the trends of EBR values with friction velocity (u(*)), thermally induced turbulence (TT), atmospheric stability (z/L), correlation coefficients for vertical velocity and water vapor (R-wq) and potential temperature (R-w theta), and relative vertical turbulent intensity (RI) are consistent with previous results obtained from other ecosystems. A significant negative linear relationship exists between the EBR and variation values of surface temperatures at landscape and local scales. Additionally, the field data confirm our previous findings from large eddy simulations that there is a positive linear relationship between the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and EBR values. Because the TKE diurnal variations explain a larger fraction (71%) of EBR diurnal variations than other variables (u(*), TT, z/L, RI, R-w theta and R-wq), we argue that TKE is mainly responsible for EBR diurnal variations and explains the different EBR diurnal variations observed here and in previous studies. The possible reason for this better performance of TKE than other variables is that the TKE includes comprehensive effects of shear, buoyancy, turbulent transport and dissipation from the TKE budget equation. Thus, TKE may be a promising indicator for potential energy balance closure correction. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the surface energy imbalance problem.",,,,,"Li, Xin/F-7473-2011","Li, Xin/0000-0003-2999-9818",,,,,,,,,,,,,0168-1923,1873-2240,,,,AUG 15,2019,274,,,,,,118,131,,10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.04.019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.04.019,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000471356600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

In eight replicates, estrus was synchronized in mature gilts (n = 198) and after last feeding of Matrix were randomly assigned to a room temperature of 15 degrees C (COLD), 21 degrees C (NEUTRAL), or 30 degrees C (HOT) and a light intensity of 11 (DIM) or 433 (BRIGHT) lx. Estrous detection was performed daily and gilts inseminated twice. Blood samples were collected before and after breeding for determination of immune measures and cortisol concentrations. Gilt ADFI, BW, and body temperature were measured. On d 30 postbreeding, gilts were slaughtered to recover reproductive tracts to evaluate pregnancy and litter characteristics. There were no temperature x light intensity interactions for any response variable. Reproductive measures of follicle development, expression of estrus, ovulation rate, pregnancy rate (83.2%), litter size (14.3 +/- 0.5), and fetal measures were not affected by temperature or lighting (P > 0.10). Gilts in COLD (37.6 degrees C) had a lower (P < 0.05) rectal temperature than those in NEUTRAL (38.2 degrees C) and HOT (38.6 +/- 0.04 degrees C). Both BW gain and final BW were greater (P < 0.0001) for gilts kept in HOT than those in NEUTRAL or COLD environments. Cortisol was greater (P < 0.01) for gilts kept in COLD compared with those kept in the HOT room. Gilts housed in the HOT environment made more postural changes (P < 0.05) than did those kept in either COLD or NEUTRAL temperatures. Gilts kept in the HOT temperature spent more total time lying and more time lying ventrally compared with those gilts housed in the NEUTRAL or COLD rooms. Total white blood cells and the percentage of neutrophils as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were all influenced (P < 0.05) by temperature but there was no effect (P > 0.10) of light or interaction with temperature on other immune cells or measures. These results indicate that temperatures in the range of 15 to 30 degrees C or light intensity at 11 to 433 lx do not impact reproduction during the follicular phase and into early gestation for mature gilts housed in gestation crates. However, room temperature does impact physiological, behavioral, and immune responses of mature gilts and should be considered as a potential factor that may influence gilt well-being during the first 30 d postbreeding.

Piecewise-linear (broken-stick) functions have been suggested to model this relationship. The aim of this paper was to assess how previously suggested triangular-shaped (TS) and plateau-shaped (PS) models performed for seven common Mediterranean crops: pea (Pisum sativum L.), lupine (Lupinus luteus L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), broad bean (Vicia faba L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare L.). Experiments were performed using a thermogradient plate, with temperatures monitored by Cu-CuNi thermocouples. Five temperature ranges, suitable to the thermal responses of each crop, were used. The TS and PS models were fitted to the resulting time to germination vs. mean temperature datasets. The choice of temperature ranges (sub-and supraoptimal in both the TS and the PS models, and an additional intermediate optimal range in the PS model) considered all possible partitions of the data points. The partition that provided the best fit was chosen. The germination rate-temperature relationship was well described by both models. The choice of model affected estimates of cardinal temperatures, thermal times, and maximum rates of germination. Differences were especially noticeable for the heavierseed crops (broad bean, chickpea, and corn), encouraging the widespread use of the PS model to simulate these relationships.

Passive greenhouse apparatus is commonly used to investigate the in situ biological response of terrestrial communities to global warming. 2. Although close conformity of greenhouse treatment effects to general circulation model (GCM) scenarios is widely claimed, no proof of such a relationship has yet been published. 3. Here, the relationship between passive greenhouse thermal environment and future climate conditions is considered using temperature data collected from within and without greenhouses deployed in the maritime Antarctic. It is revealed that in terms of thermal extremes, diel and annual variation, and overall distribution across the temperature spectrum, such apparatus achieves only poor simulation of GCM forecasts. 4. During summer, greenhouses induce an amplified daily range of temperatures, elevated maxima and accelerated rates of change. 5. During spring and autumn, diel temperature variation continues inside the greenhouses while snow cover protects the controls. 6. During winter, an inverse treatment effect occurs, in which the relative depth of snow cover causes lower temperatures in greenhouses than in controls. 7. These treatment effects differ significantly from GCM climate predictions. Changes recorded in the composition, structure and function of greenhouse biota may thus be artefacts of the methodology. 8. Thorough a priori testing of greenhouse treatment effects is recommended for future climate change studies that are to be conducted in environments subject to seasonal snowfall, solar elevation and day length.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,,,,,APR,1995,9,2,,,,,340,350,,10.2307/2390583,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2390583,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1995QU91300026,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seed-propagated Antirrhinum, Calendula, Diascia, Gerbera, Gomphrena, Heliotropium, Impatiens, Matthiola, Nemesia, Nicotiana, Nierembergia, Osteospermum, Pelargonium, Petunia, Tagetes, and Torenia were grown in five greenhouse compartments maintained at constant temperature set points of 14, 17, 20, 23 or 26 degrees C. The 16-h photoperiod consisted of the natural photoperiod with supplemental high-pressure sodium lighting from 0600 to 2200 h. The mean photosynthetic daily light integral during the two replications of this experiment varied from 9 to 18 mol m(-2) d(-1). Days to flower from transplant and number of nodes at flowering were measured on each plant. As MDT increased from 14 to 26 degrees C, days to flower decreased for all crops except Impatiens walleriana. Linear or nonlinear regression analysis was performed on the flowering rate (reciprocal of days to flower) data to estimate the base temperature (T-min) for each species, which is the temperature at which the flowering rate is zero. T-min ranged from -3.9 degrees C for Diascia barberae to 13.8 degrees C for Gomphrena globosa, which illustrates the crop-specific nature of developmental rates to temperature. The effect of MDT on node number before flowering varied among species, with four, four, and eight species showing an increase, a decrease, or no difference in node number at flowering as MDT increased. There was no apparent relationship between the estimated T-mm values and the cold hardiness of species, which indicates that cold hardiness cannot be used to reliably predict developmental rates at low temperatures or vice versa.

A potential consequence of these deficiencies is that elderly individuals could have colder lower limbs, which would exacerbate the age-related decline in plantarflexor contractile properties and compromise recovery from a tripping incident. Moreover, a common self-perception among the elderly is that their limbs are cold. However, this impression has never been documented, especially under ADL conditions. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that elderly individuals have lower plantarflexor temperatures than their younger counterparts. Skin temperatures above the plantarflexors of elderly and young individuals were continuously recorded during ADL in the winter months and compared under three conditions: quiescent indoor temperature, during a cold challenge, and the recovery period subsequent to the cold challenge. For quiescent indoor periods, differences in skin temperature between the two groups were not statistically significant. During cold exposures, both age and exposure duration were statistically significant factors related to the decrease in skin temperature, with the elderly group maintaining warmer temperatures. In the recovery period following short duration cold exposures, a statistically significant difference between the two groups for the decrease in skin temperature persisted for the first 9 min of recovery. The results do not support the hypothesis that the lower limbs of elderly participants are colder. Higher limb temperatures observed in elderly participants were consistent with previous studies of age-related thermoregulatory changes, indicating that deficiencies in vasoconstriction are persistent in ADL.

Experiments were conducted on two-year-old seedlings in growth chambers using different combinations of day and night-time temperatures. The first experiment exposed trees to 22/22, 29/22, 22/15, and 29/15 degreesC day/night (d/n). When measured at a common temperature (15, 22 or 29 degreesC), respiration rates were lower for trees exposed to higher treatment temperatures and acclimation was influenced by both day and night-time temperature. However, the extent of acclimation did not relate to mean temperature, i.e. respiration rates measured at a common temperature ranked as follows for seedlings exposed to different temperature regimes, 22/15 > 22/22 > 29/15 congruent to 29/22 degreesC d/n. Rather, acclimation of foliar respiration was linearly related to mean daily respiration rate, where mean daily respiration rate is the average of the respiration rates measured at the day and night-time treatment temperatures. The discrepancy between mean daily respiration rate and mean daily temperature occurred because respiration increased exponentially with increasing temperature. In a second experiment, the same seedlings were exposed to 22/22, 15/15, 25.5/18.5, and 25.5/15 degreesC d/n to test the relationship between mean daily respiration rate and acclimation. As in the first experiment, acclimation was linearly related to mean daily respiration rate.

This system is a hybrid temperature measurement system which consists of a monochrome array CCD camera with high resolution and a single spot colorimetric thermometer simultaneously. In this system, a narrow-band spectrum radiation temperature measurement model is established for the optical CCD-based pyrometer system, and the non-uniformity of the temperature field measurement due to the inter-element sensitivity deviations of the CCD-array detector and photometric distortion caused by the vignetting in the optical system is analyzed in detail and compensated. Furthermore, in order to eliminate the temperature fluctuation caused by the stripped iron oxide scale on billets, a temperature field reconstruction approach, which took full advantage of the high resolution characteristic of CCD and the distribution character of the surface temperature field of billets, is introduced in this system. Meanwhile, based on the narrow band spectral thermometry theory, the spot temperature measured by the colorimetric thermometer is used to correct the temperature field measured by the CCD camera on-line so as to reduce the temperature measurement error caused by the inconclusive absolute emissivity of different grades of steel and the interference of industrial dust. Currently, the system has been successfully applied and verified in some continuous casting production lines. Industrial trials indicate that the system could effectively eliminate false temperature variation caused by striped iron oxide scale and provide information about changes of processing parameters in the continuous casting production line in real time.",,,,,"hu, zhenwei/HCG-9579-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0957-0233,1361-6501,,,,JUN,2017,28,6,,,,,,,65903,10.1088/1361-6501/aa6928,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/aa6928,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000399824300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temperature fluctuations of about 0.5-0.7 degrees C with a frequency range <0.5 Hz were detectable. The microscopic growth rate fluctuates considerably around the average growth rate of I mm/min: Growth rates up to 3-4 mm/min, close to zero mm/min, as well as negative values (backmelting) were observed. Dopant striations are clearly visible in the Sb-doped crystal. They were characterized by spreading resistance measurements and differential interference contrast microscopy. The frequencies of temperature fluctuations, microscopic growth rates, and the dopant inhomogeneities correspond quite well, with main frequencies between 0.1 sind 0.3 Wt. 3D numerical simulations were performed to predict the optimum position of the temperature sensor, and the characteristic temperature amplitudes and frequencies. At a position 3.4 mm above the interface and 1.4 mm inside the melt, equivalent to the sensor tip position in the experiment, temperature fluctuations up to 1.8 degrees C and frequencies less than or equal to 0.25 Hz were found in the simulations.

Sixteen pigs administered with AA at the dose of 250 mg/kg orally and individually served as experimental animals, and 13 others administered orally with sterile water were used as control animals. The RT was measured from all the pigs at 06:00, 13:00 and 18:00 h twice in a week for three consecutive Weeks. The lowest overall mean RT Value of 37.52 +/- 0.90 C was obtained at 06:00 h in the experimental pigs, while the corresponding Value in control pigs was 37.63 +/- 0.90 C (P>0.05).

Note that outdoor weather patterns are somewhat repetitive in nature and historical records of outdoor temperature are readily accessible; we present a data-driven iterative learning approach to improve the room temperature tracking performance over time. By comparing the short-term temperature forecast with the past data, chains of (nonconsecutive) days exhibiting similar outside temperature patterns can be identified. The corresponding building operation record (heat input and temperature output trajectories) may then be used in the iterative learning control (ILC) to update the input based on the past temperature tracking error. Multizone buildings are strictly passive from the heat input to temperature output in all zones. This property assures the convergence of the ILC iteration if the update gain is suitably bounded, without the need of an accurate model. This means that for each chain, the zone temperature deviation from the specified profile will converge to zero as the number of days in the chain grows (i.e., as more iterations of ILC are performed). Using a six-zone physical test bed with programmable ambient temperatures, we demonstrate the practicality of the proposed approach in multiple experimental trials. Additional longer-duration simulations are performed based on the actual temperature recorded in Orlando, FL, USA and New York, NY, USA over a two-year period. In all cases, ILC is shown to improve the tracking error in the presence of ambient temperature fluctuations. Note to Practitioners-This paper uses historic operating data and weather forecasting to improve the temperature tracking in multizone buildings. The proposed approach exploits the inherent passivity property of the building thermal model and, therefore, does not require the accurate model identification prior to implementation. As a result, this method may be conveniently retrofitted to any existing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, provided that the system is capable of adjusting the heat input (e.g., by controlling the supply air flow rate) and storing temperature sensor data. The algorithm uses weather prediction to match the upcoming ambient temperature variation with those experienced in the past. With the past operating data (control input and resulting temperature error) from the matched day, a feed-forward control is iteratively updated to improve the tracking performance. This paper includes the experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in our test bed, and simulation examples to provide the insight into the real-world implementation. This approach may be extended to other external heat sources exhibiting repetitive patterns, e.g., occupancy, equipment, and solar input.",,,,,"Wen, John/B-4474-2008","Wen, John/0000-0002-5123-5411",,,,,,,,,,,,,1545-5955,1558-3783,,,,OCT,2019,16,4,,,,,1896,1906,,10.1109/TASE.2019.2899377,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2019.2899377,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000492428500036,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, a steady-state response model of a SERFG dependent on the vapor cell temperature is established, and a method to reduce the vapor cell temperature error of the SERFG is developed. By adjusting the vapor cell temperature, the SERFG can be tuned to a working point where the output signal is insensitive to the cell temperature fluctuation, i.e., the insensitive point, so that the bias error induced by cell temperature fluctuations can be effectively suppressed. The proposed method is verified by experiments, and experimental results are in good agreement with the model.

So far, we know little about potential physiological adjustments of subtropical corals to seasonal temperature changes (>8 degrees C) that substantially exceed temperature fluctuation experienced by their counterparts in the tropics. This study investigated the effect of temperature reductions on Montastraea cavemosa and Ponies astreoides in Bermuda (32 degrees N; sea surface temperature similar to 19-29 degrees C) over 5 weeks, applying the following treatments: (i) constant control temperature at 28 degrees C, and (ii) temperature reduction (0.5 degrees C day(-1)) followed by constant temperature (20 days; acclimatization period) at 24 degrees C and (iii) at 20 degrees C. Both species decreased photosynthesis and respiration during temperature reduction as expected, which continued to decrease during the acclimatization period, indicating adjustment to a low energy turnover rather than thermal compensation. Trajectories of physiological adjustments and level of thermal compensation, however, differed between species. Montastraea cavemosa zooxanthellae metrics showed a strong initial response to temperature reduction, followed by a return to close to control values during the acclimatization period, reflecting a high physiological flexibility and low thermal compensation. Ponies astreoides zooxanthellae, in contrast, showed no initial response, but an increase in pigment concentration per zooxanthellae and similar photosynthesis rates at 24 degrees C and 20 degrees C at the end of the experiment, indicating low acute thermal sensitivity and the ability for thermal compensation at the lowest temperature. Respiration decreased more strongly than photosynthesis, leading to significant build-up of biomass in both species (energy reserves).

Annual stream temperature dynamics are useful in classifying fundamental thermal regimes and can enhance process-based interpretation of stream temperature controls, including deep and shallow groundwater discharge, when paired with air signals. In this study, we investigated mull-scale variability in annual paired air-water temperature patterns using sine-wave linear regressions of mull-year daily temperature data from streams of various sizes. A total of 311 sites from two spatially intensive regional datasets (Shenandoah National Park and Olympic Experimental State Forest) and a spatially extensive national dataset spanning the contiguous United States (U.S. Geological Survey gages) were evaluated. We calculated three annual air-water thermal metrics (mean ratio, phase lag, and amplitude ratio) to deduce the influence of groundwater and other watershed processes on stream thermal regimes at multiple spatial scales. Site-specific values of the three annual air-water thermal metrics ranged from 0.69 to 5.29 (mean ratio), -9 to 40 days (phase lag), and 0.29 to 1.12 (amplitude ratio). Regional patterns in the annual thermal metrics revealed persistent yet spatially variable influences of shallow groundwater discharge and high levels of thermal variability within watersheds, indicating the importance of local hydrogeological controls on stream temperature. Furthermore, annual thermal metric patterns from the regional datasets were generally concordant with the national dataset suggesting the utility of these annual thermal metrics for analysis at multiple scales. Analysis of the national dataset showed that previously defined thermal regimes based on water temperature alone could be further refined using air-water metrics and these metrics were related to physiographic watershed characteristics such as contributing area, elevation, and slope. This research demonstrates the importance of spatial scale and heterogeneity for inferring hydrological process in streams and provides guidance for the interpretation of annual air-water temperature metrics that can be efficiently applied to the growing database of multi-year temperature records.

Selected according to a rotatable central composite design, these treatment combinations represent commercial greenhouse conditions during the winter and spring in the midwestern United States; each selected condition was maintained in an environmental growth chamber having 12-hour photoperiods. ROSESIM incorporates regression models of four flower development characteristics (days from pinch to visible bud, first color, sepal reflex, and flowering) that are full quadratic polynomials in PPF, DT, and NT. ROSESIM also incorporates mathematical models of nine plant growth characteristics (stem length and the following fresh and dry weights: stem, leaf, flower, and total) based on data recorded every 10 days and at flowering. At each design point, a cubic regression in time (days from pinch) estimated the plant growth characteristics on intermediate days; then difference equations were developed to predict the resulting daily growth increments as third-degree polynomial functions of days from pinch, PPF, DT, and NT. ROSESIM was verified by plotting against time each simulated plant growth characteristic and the associated experimental observations for the eight factorial design points defining the region of interest. Moreover, one-way analysis of variance procedures were applied to the differences between ROSESIM predictions and the corresponding observed means for all 15 treatment combinations. At 20 days from pinch, significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed for all nine plant growth characteristics. At 30 and 40 days from pinch, only flower fresh and dry weights yielded significant differences; at flowering, none of the 13 selected responses yielded significant differences.

This study aims to break this technical barrier. The ER of three trunk sections of different Australian native tree species was measured at varying temperature (control experiments), and for different moisture contents. The results show that wood ER decreases with an increase of temperature in a nonlinear manner, and that the exponential model performs the best to represent the temperature effect on ER in comparison to two other models (the linear model and power function model). The key parameter in the exponential model for sapwood, reflecting temperature sensitivity, fluctuates in a narrow range between 0.032 and 0.036 degrees C-1. It appears to be independent of tree species, but significantly different from the value recommended in the literature for temperature correction in soil electrical resistivity. The temporal variations of temperature-corrected ER capture wood moisture variations in time.

There were no differences in torpor occurrence, duration and depth between M. murinus from the rain and dry forest. Mouse lemurs using daily torpor reduced their energy expenditure by 11% in the rain forest and by 10.5% in the dry forest, respectively. There was no significant difference in the mean water flux rates of mouse lemurs remaining normothermic between populations of both sites. In contrast, mean water flux rate of individuals from the dry forest that used torpor was significantly lower than those from the rain forest. This study represents the first account of energy expenditure, water flux and skin temperature (T (sk)) in free-ranging M. murinus from the rain forest. Our comparative findings suggest that water turnover and therefore water requirement during the austral winter months plays a more restricting role on grey mouse lemurs from the dry forest than on those from the rain forest.",,,,,"Speakman, John R./A-9494-2008","Speakman, John R./0000-0002-2457-1823",,,,,,,,,,,,,0028-1042,1432-1904,,,,MAY,2009,96,5,,,,,609,620,,10.1007/s00114-009-0515-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-009-0515-z,,,,,,,,19229507,,,,,WOS:000264994600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

An example is the Columbia River Valley in east-central Oregon-Washington, a significant wind energy generation region and the site of the Second Wind Forecast Improvement Project (WFIP2). Data from three Doppler lidars deployed during WFIP2 define and characterize summertime wind regimes and their large-scale contexts, and provide insight into NWP model errors by examining differences in the ability of a model [NOAA's High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR version 1)] to forecast wind speed profiles for different flow regimes. Seven regimes were identified based on daily time series of the lidar-measured rotor-layer winds, which then suggested two broad categories. First, in three of the regimes the primary dynamic forcing was the large-scale pressure gradient. Second, in two other regimes the dominant forcing was the diurnal heating-cooling cycle (regional sea-breeze-type dynamics), including the marine intrusion previously described, which generates strong nocturnal winds over the region. For the large-scale pressure gradient regimes, HRRR had wind speed biases of similar to 1 m s(-1) and RMSEs of 2-3 m s(-1). Errors were much larger for the thermally forced regimes, owing to the premature demise of the strong nocturnal flow in HRRR. Thus, the more dominant the role of surface heating in generating the flow, the larger the errors. Major errors could result from surface heating of the atmosphere, boundary layer responses to that heating, and associated terrain interactions. Measurement/modeling research programs should be designed to determine which of these modeled processes produce the largest errors, so those processes can be improved and errors reduced. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Modeling and forecasting low-level winds over complex terrain are a significant challenge. Here we verify NOAA's HRRR model against wind speed data from three Doppler lidars at a complex-terrain location in central Oregon and Washington. We grouped summertime days according to daily patterns or regimes of wind behavior. Regimes where synoptic pressure gradients dominated the physical forcing showed model errors of 2-3 m s(-1) rms. Regimes where the forcing was dominated by thermal contrast-regional sea-breeze type forcing-had much larger errors, reaching twice as big. The more dominant the role of surface heating in generating the flow, the larger the model errors. Characterizing and diagnosing model errors in this way can be an important step in improving NWP model skill.",,,,,"Olson, Joseph B/N-3726-2014; Benjamin, Stanley G/C-5818-2015; Banta, Robert M/B-8361-2008","Olson, Joseph B/0000-0003-3612-0808; Benjamin, Stanley G/0000-0002-5751-8236; Banta, Robert M/0000-0002-0009-5340",,,,,,,,,,,,,0882-8156,1520-0434,,,,DEC,2021,36,6,,,,,1961,1983,,10.1175/WAF-D-21-0012.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-21-0012.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000757394200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

SOYBEAN (GLYCINE-MAX),EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eleven genotypes of soyabean (Glycine max) of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate origin and one accession of G. soja were grown in six locations in Australia during 1986-88, and at one location in Australia and two in Taiwan during 1989-91. Dates of sowing were varied within and among locations so as to expose plants to as many as 32 environments of widely different diurnal temperature and daylength. Times from sowing to flowering (f) were recorded, from which rates of progress towards flowering (1/f) were calculated. These derived data were then related to mean pre-flowering values of temperature (TBAR) and photoperiod (P) using a three-plane linear model developed from controlled environment data. Among genotypes, mean values off varied between 24-49 d and between 134-291 d in the most- and least-inductive environments, respectively. These differences were associated with variations in P from about 11 to 16 h d-1, in daily mean maximum temperatures from about 17-degrees to 36-degrees-C, in daily mean minimum temperatures from about 5-degrees to 25-degrees-C, and in TBAR from about 11-degrees to 30-degrees-C, that is, a very wide range of photothermal regimes. The relations of 1/f to TBAR and P can be described in photoperiod-insensitive genotypes by a thermal plane defined by two constants, a and b, and additionally by a photothermal plane defined by three constants, a', b' and c', in the more numerous photoperiod-sensitive genotypes. If photoperiod-sensitive genotypes are grown in sufficiently long days then a third photoperiod and temperature-insensitive plane is exposed, defined by a constant, d'; this plane indicates the maximum delay in flowering of which the genotype is capable. The constants a', b', c' and d' define the delay in flowering caused by photoperiod-sensitivity genes. The two intercepts between the three planes define, respectively, the critical photoperiod, P(c), above which increase in daylength delays flowering, and the ceiling photoperiod, P(ce), above which there is no further delay. The values of the six constants for any genotype can be estimated from observations of fin several natural environments. Comparisons between years in Australia and between Australia and Taiwan show that these genotypic constants can predict 1/f, and so the time taken to flower, given data on latitude, sowing date and daily values of maximum and minimum air temperatures. This model is more accurate than an alternative logistic model; we also believe that all six constants in the three-plane rate model described here have biological meaning. They indicate separate genetic control of flowering responses to P and TBAR and could form a rational basis for the genetic characterization and analysis of these responses in the soyabean germplasm.",,,,,"Qi, Aiming/AAH-7872-2021; Lawn, Robert J/E-8528-2011","Qi, Aiming/0000-0002-0784-9520; Lawn, Robert J/0000-0001-7820-4650; Ellis, Richard/0000-0002-3695-6894",,,,,,,,,,,,,0014-4797,,,,,JUL,1993,29,3,,,,,253,289,,10.1017/S0014479700020858,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0014479700020858,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1993LP08700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study compares the data from various limb-viewing instruments with model simulations from the middle stratosphere to the lower mesosphere. Data from three sub-millimetre instruments and two infrared spectrometers are used, namely from the Sub-Millimetre Radiometer (SMR) on board Odin, the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board Aura, the Superconducting Submillimeter-wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) on the International Space Station, the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) on board ENVISAT, and the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on board SCISAT. Inter-comparison of the measurements from instruments on sun-synchronous satellites (SMR, MLS, MIPAS) and measurements from solar occultation instruments (ACE-FTS) is challenging since the measurements correspond to different solar zenith angles (or local times). However, using a model which covers all solar zenith angles and data from the SMILES instrument which measured at all local times over a period of several months provides the possibility to verify the model and to indirectly compare the diurnally variable species. The satellite data were averaged for latitudes of 20 degrees S to 20 degrees N for the SMILES observation period from November 2009 to April 2010 and were compared at three altitudes: 35, 45 and 55 km. Besides presenting the SMILES data, the study also shows a first comparison of the latest MLS data (version 3.3) of HOCl, ClO, and HO2 with other satellite observations, as well as a first evaluation of HO2 observations made by Odin/SMR. The MISU-1D model has been carefully initialised and run for conditions and locations of the observations. The diurnal cycle features for the species investigated here are generally well reproduced by the model. The satellite observations and the model agree well in terms of absolute mixing ratios. The differences between the day and night values of the model are in good agreement with the observations although the amplitude of the HO2 diurnal variation is 10-20 % lower in the model than in the observations. In particular, the data offered the opportunity to study the reaction ClO+HO2 -> HOCl+O-2 in the lower mesosphere at 55 km. At this altitude the HOCl night-time variation depends only on this reaction. The result of this analysis points towards a value of the rate constant within the range of the JPL 2006 recommendation and the upper uncertainty limit of the JPL 2011 recommendation at 55 km.",,,,,"Jonsson, Andreas I/B-3887-2013; Urban, Jo/F-9172-2010; Santee, MIchelle/R-5762-2019; KASAI, Yasuko/Q-3103-2018; Shiotani, Masato/M-8498-2017; Baron, Philippe/I-5927-2018; Murtagh, Donal/F-8694-2011","Jonsson, Andreas I/0000-0003-0321-6213; Urban, Jo/0000-0001-7026-793X; KASAI, Yasuko/0000-0002-6986-5235; Shiotani, Masato/0000-0001-5844-4032; Baron, Philippe/0000-0001-7141-5260; Murtagh, Donal/0000-0003-1539-3559",,,,,,,,,,,,,1680-7316,1680-7324,,,,,2013,13,15,,,,,7587,7606,,10.5194/acp-13-7587-2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-13-7587-2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000323103900020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we study the DEE of the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), which is declining in the UK. We hypothesise that there is a gradient of suitable habitat for hedgehogs in rural areas, which is a result of fewer food resources, a higher risk from predation by badgers (Meles meles) and colder ambient temperatures, as distance to the nearest building increases. We used the doubly labelled water method to obtain 44 measurements of DEE from hedgehogs on four predominately arable sites, to determine the energetic costs associated with proximity to buildings, on sites with and without badgers. The mean +/- s.e.m. DEE was 508.9 +/- 34.8 kJ day(-1). DEE increased the further a hedgehog was from buildings during the study, possibly as they ranged larger distances on arable land, supporting the hypothesis that hedgehogs select villages owing to the lower energy demands in comparison to arable farmland. Hedgehogs had an approximately 30% lower DEE on sites with badgers. We speculate that on badger-occupied sites, hedgehogs may restrict movement and foraging in response to a threat from predation and thus have reduced DEE. Therefore, hedgehogs may also seek refuge in villages where the perceived threat of predation is lower and foraging is unrestricted. In a broader context, we demonstrate that individual differences in DEE can aid in understanding habitat selection in a patchily distributed species.",,,,,,"Pettett, Carly/0000-0002-4390-0696",,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,FEB 1,2017,220,3,,,,,460,468,,10.1242/jeb.150359,http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.150359,,,,,,,,28148819,,,,,WOS:000394100300023,View Full Record in Web of Science

The measurements were conducted in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia (56 degrees 19'37 '' N 44 degrees 00'27 '' E) in 2013 and 2018. The 8 mm radiometer was used to measure the brightness temperature of thermal radiation, and the vertical component of the atmospheric electric field were carried out using an electrostatic fluxmeter. With the use of meteorological data and electric field measurements the state of analyzed events has been classified into 4 types: cloudless atmosphere and high-level clouds (Cs), cumulus clouds (Cu), cumulonimbus clouds without lightning that cause strong electrical field disturbances near the ground surface (Cb), cumulonimbus thunderstorm clouds with lightning discharges (Cb+). Detailed statistical characteristics of brightness temperature fluctuations and short-period electric field fluctuations are obtained for the first time for the indicated types of events. It is shown that measured spectral densities of the atmosphere brightness temperature and electric field fluctuations correspond well enough in the considered frequency range to the results of presented theoretical consideration. Precipitation particles in clouds can be considered herewith as passive scalar, and the movement of inhomogeneities in the particle density can be described by Kolmogorov theory. Since electric charges are located on the precipitation with small droplet and ice particles, an increase in the inhomogeneities of the water content means likely an increase in the inhomogeneities of the electric charge. For thunderclouds the estimates of the relative fluctuations of liquid water content give values of the order of tens of percent.

Previous research showed proof of concept that analysis of paired temperature signals of stream and pore waters can simultaneously provide monitoring scour and deposition, stream sediment thermal regime, and seepage velocity information. However, it did not address challenges often associated with natural systems, including nonideal temperature variations (low-amplitude, nonsinusoidal signal, and vertical thermal gradients) and natural flooding conditions on monitoring scour and deposition processes over time. Here we addressed this knowledge gap by testing the proposed thermal scour-deposition chain (TSDC) methodology, with laboratory experiments to test the impact of nonideal temperature signals under a range of seepage velocities and with a field application during a pulse flood. Both analyses showed excellent match between surveyed and temperature-derived bed elevation changes even under very low temperature signal amplitudes (less than 1 degrees C), nonideal signal shape (sawtooth shape), and strong and changing vertical thermal gradients (4 degrees C/m). Root-mean-square errors on predicting the change in streambed elevations were comparable with the median grain size of the streambed sediment. Future research should focus on improved techniques for temperature signal phase and amplitude extractions, as well as TSDC applications over long periods spanning entire hydrographs. Plain Language Summary Sediment transport in stream causes erosion and depositional processes, which are difficult to monitor continuously. These processes are typically monitored with surveys, which may be several days apart if not years. Here we tested a new method, which can monitor point scour and deposition at the daily time scale over years.

To cancel the effect of temperature, a surface acoustic wave strain sensor which consisted of three langasite surface acoustic wave resonators was presented in this work. The surface acoustic wave resonators are configured to ensure that the propagation directions of the surface acoustic wave in the three surface acoustic wave resonators are parallel, perpendicular and at an orientation of 30 degrees to the applied strain. The strain sensitivities of the three surface acoustic wave resonators from room temperature to 250 degrees C were investigated. Functional relationships of the resonance frequency shifts of the three surface acoustic wave resonators due to both the temperature and applied strain were established. It was deduced that the strain was linearly represented by the resonance frequency shifts of the three surface acoustic wave resonators. Experimental results demonstrated that the langasite surface acoustic wave strain sensor was well worked within the temperature range from room temperature to 250 degrees C.

In order to predict frost formation during storage of frozen vegetables, a numerical model consisting of a cylindrical container filled with frozen carrot slices was developed. It was exposed to external temperature fluctuations. The parameters of the model were identified by experimental measurements or found in the literature. The model was validated using a set of independent experimental results that showed good agreement with the simulated predictions. The model is able to predict air velocities, air and product temperatures and local frost formation. It was used to show that the most important parameters affecting total frost formation are the effective mass diffusivity and the convective heat coefficient within the container.

In order to determine the adaptive response to short-term heat stress, we exposed S. acaulis cushions at field sites to controlled heat treatments using infrared lamps. Natural diurnal changes in heat tolerance were monitored at alpine sites and at a site distinctly below the natural distribution boundary, where higher temperatures were expected. The range of heat tolerance limits in summer, 45.5-54.5 degreesC (9 K), exceeded that reported for other alpine species (0.1-5 K) and even that for total seasonal changes (5-8 K). Heat tolerance either increased or decreased on most days (80%). The maximum diurnal increase was +4.7 K. Under the experimental conditions heat hardening started at leaf temperatures around 30 degreesC and proceeded at mean rates of 1.0+/-0.5 K/h. The onset of functional disturbances in photosystem II also occurred at 30 degreesC. Heating rates exceeding those naturally found above 30 degreesC (> 10 K/h) appeared to retard heat hardening. During summer average leaf temperature maxima were 12.4 K (600 m) and 13.0 K (1945 m) higher than air temperature which corroborates the heat trapping nature of cushion plants. At 600 m, as compared to 1945 m, cushions experienced significantly higher leaf temperature maxima (+8.8 K) and exceeded 30 degreesC on most days (80%). This resulted in a significantly higher heat tolerance (LT50) at 600 m (51.7+/-0.2 degreesC) than at 1945 m (49.8+/-0.2 degreesC). The fast short-term changes of heat tolerance in summer help S. acaulis to cope with the occasional diurnal short-term heat stress associated with cushion growth.",,,,,"Neuner, Gilbert/J-9909-2017","Neuner, Gilbert/0000-0003-2415-6125; Buchner, Othmar/0000-0003-0733-6562",,,,,,,,,,,,,1435-8603,1438-8677,,,,NOV,2000,2,6,,,,,677,683,,10.1055/s-2000-16635,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-2000-16635,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000166199900015,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Bish, DL; Carey, JW; Vaniman, DT; Chipera, SJ",,,,"Bish, DL; Carey, JW; Vaniman, DT; Chipera, SJ",,,Stability of hydrous minerals on the martian surface,ICARUS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The presence of water-bearing minerals on Mars has long been discussed, but little or no data exist showing that minerals such as smectites and zeolites may be present on the surface in a hydrated state (i.e., that they could contain H2O molecules in their interlayer or extra-framework sites, respectively). We have analyzed experimental thermodynamic and X-ray powder diffraction data for smectite and the most common terrestrial zeolite, clinoptilolite, to evaluate the state of hydration of these minerals under martian surface conditions. Thermodynamic data for clinoptilolite show that water molecules in its extra-framework sites are held very strongly, with enthalpies of dehydration for Ca-clinoptilolite up to three times greater than that for liquid water. Using these data, we calculated the Gibbs free energy of hydration of clinoptilolite and smectite as a function of temperature and pressure. The calculations demonstrate that these minerals would indeed be hydrated under the very low-P (H2O) conditions existing on Mars, a reflection of their high affinities for H2O. These calculations assuming the partial pressure of H2O and the temperature range expected on Mars suggest that, if present on the surface, zeolites and Ca-smectites could also play a role in affecting the diurnal variations in martian atmospheric H2O because their calculated water contents vary considerably over daily martian temperature ranges. The open crystal structure of clinoptilolite and existing hydration and kinetic data suggest that hydration/dehydration are not kinetically limited. Based on these calculations, it is possible that hydrated zeolites and clay minerals may explain some of the recent observations of significant amounts of hydrogen not attributable to water ice at martian mid-latitudes.

The thermal behavior of the high temperature heat pipe has been widely researched by theoretical and experimental approaches, including designing, manufacture, numerical analysis, and experimental test on its thermal characteristics of start-up process and operation. As the heat pipe has a potential application protest on mobile nuclear reactors, this paper carried out experimental study on the thermal behavior of the high temperature heat pipe under various motion conditions. The temperature distributions on the heat pipe surface under transitory inclination, vertical heave, and periodic swing, are measured to evaluate the impact of motion conditions on the heat transfer of heat pipe at horizontal position. The transitory inclination causes an obvious temperature variation at both evaporator and condenser. The vertical heave, of which the motion direction is perpendicular to the heat pipe, has negligible impact on the isothermality of the heat pipe. The periodic swing leads to periodic temperature fluctuation, of which the amplitude increase with the decease of the period time. Besides, the dry out phenomenon is easier to happen at the evaporator when the condenser is longer. This paper summarizes the impact of different motion types on the thermal behavior of a horizontal heat pipe and provides a reference for the design and application of the high temperature heat pipe used in nuclear reactors.

Periods between 10 and 5 d before anthesis; and between 5 d before- and 5 d after-anthesis were most sensitive to high temperatures causing maximum decreases in floret fertility. Mean daily temperatures >25 degrees C quadratically decreased floret fertility (reaching 0% at 37 degrees C) when imposed at the start of panicle emergence. Temperatures ranging from 25 to 37 degrees C quadratically decreased individual grain weight when imposed at the start of grain filling. Both floret fertility and individual grain weights decreased quadratically with increasing duration (0-35 d or 49 d during floret development or grain filling stage, respectively) of high temperature stress.

According to these features, the field experiment was conducted to analyze the diurnal variation of the leaf water potential (psi(L)), stomatal conductance (G(s)), transpiration rate (E) and net photosynthetic rate (Pn). Meanwhile, the relationship between typical meteorological factors such as atmospheric temperature (T), solar radiation (R-s), relative air humidity (RH) with oat's physiological indicators were investigated with the corresponding regression models. The experiment results show that the daily oat's psi(L) changed obviously during the different growth stages. The daily oat's change curve psi(L) show 'V-type' in the seeding and heading stages, and the lowest value respectively appeared in 5:00 a.m and 4:00 p.m. However, oat's psi(L) show 'W-type' in the jointing and tillering stages in which the lowest value both appeared in the morning and afternoon. The maximum change range of psi(L) can reach 6 MPa in a day. At the same time, the diurnal variation of G(s), E and Pn respectively show 'bimodal', 'multimodal', 'bimodal'. In detail, the maximum value respectively were 6.495 millimol.m(-2)s(-1),42.31 millimol.m(-2)s(-1), 66.46 mu molm(-2)s(-1) which appeared in 9:00 a.m, 4:00 p.m, 12: 00 a.m. Based on the regression analysis, the effect order of meteorologic factors on oat's four physiological indicators are: T>RH>R-s; R-s>RH>T; RH>R-s>T; T>RH>R-s, respectively for psi(L), G(s), E and Pn.
